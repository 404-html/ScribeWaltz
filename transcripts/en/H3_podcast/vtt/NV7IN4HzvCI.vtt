1
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the h three podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

2
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to compete with Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>

3
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.253
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My theory is that a podcast can never </v>

4
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>compete with an experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gotten an experience.</v>

5
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to,</v>

6
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:25.220
<v Speaker 1>even the playing field a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to see weed pills or something.</v>

7
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.713
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need some kind of supplement </v>

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>experience supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they get to hymns.</v>

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>It Felix Gray and audible for sponsoring</v>
<v Speaker 1>us today.</v>

10
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>And if you haven't already guessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

11
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 1>I would say are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arguably the most successful youtuber of</v>

12
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:40.400
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bieber.</v>

13
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Bieber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no argument.</v>

15
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>No fight number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we say number two?</v>

16
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.393
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like the idea is that like if </v>

17
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you make stuff outside of Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more successful.</v>

18
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like their youtube or is make</v>

19
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>way more money than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More people.</v>

20
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's like,</v>

21
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's legit and successful just cause you</v>

22
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my mind I feel like it,</v>

23
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>there's some truth to it.</v>

24
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.910
<v Speaker 1>If you can escape in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost,</v>

25
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 1>it is an escape because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really frees you,</v>

26
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>like what you do with your comedy acts </v>
<v Speaker 1>is kind of not compatible with youtube.</v>

27
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of,</v>

28
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.853
<v Speaker 1>well it's like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not the whole stage and the </v>

30
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>lighting and all the coordination and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappearing for a year.</v>

31
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>

32
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 1>that's really why I left or not left eye</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was,</v>

33
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you moved on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to do live stuff.</v>

34
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.853
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when I was posting the early </v>

35
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I just wanted to perform on stage,</v>

36
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>I was doing theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where we want it to do.</v>

37
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.420
<v Speaker 1>When I was performing those videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'd be like,</v>

38
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:39.254
<v Speaker 1>I really want to go to stage with these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I performed them on stage and </v>

39
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:41.864
<v Speaker 1>if I had posted the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't get that much of a reaction </v>

40
00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:44.841
<v Speaker 1>when you realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

41
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't post this stuff and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard it for the first time and the room</v>

42
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

43
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>it was a exciting so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't introduce you Bo Burnham.</v>

45
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>basically I would say one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>beloved comedy acts for the past decade,</v>

47
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>including two of my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what and make happy on Netflix.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

84
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 2>though I haven't been like posting a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>on youtube.</v>

85
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching the shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

86
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:22.870

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

87
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:23.704
<v Speaker 2>like my main relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet is as a viewer and as someone </v>

88
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 2>just on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I ask,</v>

89
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 2>who do you frequent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

90
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 2>who do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

92
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 2>like it's really popular that I watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

93
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's like it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I,</v>

94
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.933
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of what the movie ended up </v>

95
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.144
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love people in the Internet that no </v>

96
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 2>one's watching.</v>

97
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

102
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 2>but I really love like people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet that no one's watching.</v>

103
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 2>So I'll often like search something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then view it by Upload Day.</v>

104
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the nitty gritty.</v>

105
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I love deep dives.</v>

106
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:04.234
<v Speaker 2>Like there's this dude who's a hoarder </v>
<v Speaker 2>who cooks hot dogs on candles and it's </v>

107
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 2>very nauseated and see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have character or is it just the,</v>

108
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 2>it's the intrigue of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he have character?</v>

109
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Like it seemed very entertaining or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bone chilling.</v>

110
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.541
<v Speaker 2>It's chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

111
00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

112
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like can we show,</v>

113
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.283
<v Speaker 2>we give him a shout out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know his name and I don't know </v>

114
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.540
<v Speaker 2>if he's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

115
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.393
<v Speaker 2>but really it's like he takes a tour of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his like hoarding house and he cooks </v>

116
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:29.014
<v Speaker 2>like he called some sausages and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a video of him making sausages and </v>

117
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:32.250
<v Speaker 2>peaches.</v>

118
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 2>It's absolute incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could probably pull it up.</v>

119
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of cooking sausages and it's </v>

120
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:42.511
<v Speaker 2>really not the hot dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sausages or the PT calls it sausages</v>

121
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 2>and peaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is most certainly hot dogs.</v>

122
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.873
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

123
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like,</v>

124
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.180
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

125
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

126
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:51.241
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

127
00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I've watched a lot of [inaudible] them </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the background and I want to talk a</v>

128
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 2>lot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But first I want to ask like,</v>

129
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.960
<v Speaker 2>what was your motivation almost for </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing this film?</v>

130
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a departure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a surprise to a lot of your</v>

131
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 2>fans of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow,</v>

132
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 2>where did this movie come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very specific.</v>

133
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be too,</v>

134
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 2>with a very specific narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you had a purpose.</v>

135
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 2>So I'm wondering what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>

136
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:13.660
<v Speaker 2>what motivated you to go that route?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

137
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 2>it's about a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a 13 year old girl last week,</v>

138
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 2>eighth grade.</v>

139
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.310
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did stand in for like,</v>

140
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 2>and found it already by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

141
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 2>We'll cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

142
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.763
<v Speaker 2>it'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be a hard letting me Andreas </v>

143
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.170
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

144
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 2>I I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 2>perform standup for a long time and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was feeling anxious and I wanted to sort</v>

146
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:32.644
<v Speaker 2>of talk about the internet and my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety in a way and sort of I had felt </v>

147
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:36.754
<v Speaker 2>like my anxiety for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like very specific to me being a </v>

148
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:41.680
<v Speaker 2>25 year old comedian with like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>

149
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.903
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I would like do my shows and </v>

150
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:48.880
<v Speaker 2>like young kids would come up to me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say they felt like me and they felt like</v>

151
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:49.803
<v Speaker 2>they knew what I was going through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when I was talking about was like </v>

152
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 2>being on stage in front of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

153
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is this resonating with you?</v>

154
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just think that sort of pressures,</v>

155
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 2>the weird pressures that are usually </v>
<v Speaker 2>only afforded to like d list celebrities</v>

156
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 2>have now been democratized and given to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

157
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 2>So I was always interested in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are telling a story about someone on</v>

158
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 2>the Internet that nobody's watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause the Internet tends to end,</v>

159
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:11.414
<v Speaker 2>the culture at large tends to only talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the people on the Internet that </v>

160
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:14.654
<v Speaker 2>are being seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the majority of people on the </v>

161
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:16.634
<v Speaker 2>Internet and there's a lot more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are just talking to the camera and </v>

162
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:20.174
<v Speaker 2>nobody's watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 99% of the videos that are </v>

163
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.910
<v Speaker 2>uploaded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>99.9</v>

164
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the kind of,</v>

165
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 2>the only thing we talk about is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that go viral and as someone that</v>

166
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 2>went viral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really not that interesting.</v>

167
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.693
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the actual interesting thing </v>

168
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:34.934
<v Speaker 2>is just trying to engage with this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to be seen and trying to be </v>

169
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 2>heard.</v>

170
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 2>And to me the people that weren't being </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard,</v>

171
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 2>we're actually engaged in a much deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more honest and thing.</v>

172
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.023
<v Speaker 2>Well there was one of the central themes</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that I extracted from it was </v>

173
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:47.564
<v Speaker 2>like how social media or this abundance </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all this going on with youtube and </v>

174
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:53.174
<v Speaker 2>twitter and instagram is affecting kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think when there's a five year </v>

175
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:57.464
<v Speaker 2>difference between us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I grew up there was no like </v>

176
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.443
<v Speaker 2>grow hap as a kid was hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when you have all this new </v>

177
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:09.830
<v Speaker 2>social media introduced to them and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that you portray the girl,</v>

178
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 2>how she's glued to the social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very accurate.</v>

179
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how is this affecting kids?</v>

180
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know all the time is that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't quite know exactly like,</v>

181
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:20.723
<v Speaker 2>and truly it was me wanting to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how it felt to me and how it felt </v>

182
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 2>to me was it made me feel nervous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird and unsure of myself.</v>

183
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 2>And that seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean social media.</v>

184
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

185
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Just having to sort of represent </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

186
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.690
<v Speaker 2>having to live your life and then also </v>
<v Speaker 2>live your life on this other place.</v>

187
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 2>And then the sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that floating behind yourself</v>

188
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 2>through situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

189
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.703
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's like weird and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disembodied and like a little </v>

190
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:49.121
<v Speaker 2>disassociated or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But more than anything it was like I,</v>

191
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy for people to like leave the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie thinking about that stuff,</v>

192
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want the movie to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted talk or like,</v>

193
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean some like finger wagging shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that's what so annoys me.</v>

194
00:07:58.401 --> 00:07:59.121
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

195
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:00.970
<v Speaker 2>let me just say one more thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

196
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like that,</v>

197
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.013
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just feels like the Internet hasn't </v>

198
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:05.954
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in least in popular media hasn't even </v>

199
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 2>been described,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone figure it out.</v>

200
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Like so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

201
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.351
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

202
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:18.560
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to portray it and portray </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

203
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 2>how it feels to her and me a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just weird.</v>

204
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:24.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot,</v>

205
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just shitty.</v>

206
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we should just,</v>

207
00:08:26.621 --> 00:08:27.454
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we had through our phones and the </v>

208
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:29.150
<v Speaker 2>ocean and we'd be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

209
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.220
<v Speaker 2>it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're super connected,</v>

210
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 2>we're super lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're super stimulated,</v>

211
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 2>we're super numb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're self expressing and objectifying.</v>

212
00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:37.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

213
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be here without the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

214
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Like obviously I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so grateful for it.</v>

215
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also it's,</v>

216
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:44.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

217
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there may be a happy medium between like</v>

218
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.733
<v Speaker 2>60 minutes talking about like narcissist</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids and like come on creators or </v>

219
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck youtube conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>is where it can't</v>

220
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 1>self examine it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

221
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 1>well I'm on my part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a grown man more or less.</v>

222
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.783
<v Speaker 1>And I've recently pretty much quit using</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media because it's honestly too </v>

223
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>much for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

224
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.423
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

225
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.150
<v Speaker 1>like even me for for a long day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like a quota for myself for,</v>

226
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.993
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to post every day on twitter </v>

227
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:17.154
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

228
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Cause in a way it's like if I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet,</v>

229
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:20.874
<v Speaker 1>do I exist still?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like am I still in the minds of these </v>

230
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I found by the way,</v>

231
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 1>that the answer is very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

232
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:26.844
<v Speaker 1>you still do exist if you don't tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like there was just a really </v>

233
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.133
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy interaction I had with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like checking it first thing in the </v>

234
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that too.</v>

235
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I started to sitting down and he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be on my phone.</v>

236
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucked up.</v>

237
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.043
<v Speaker 1>This is totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't really get a lot of </v>

238
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:45.010
<v Speaker 1>time out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sit down at what do you mean?</v>

239
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 1>What does that buy you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 30 seconds,</v>

240
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 minutes at most,</v>

241
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a edition.</v>

242
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.990
<v Speaker 1>We'll get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

243
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

244
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:55.644
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

245
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:56.603
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is part of what the mood is hoping </v>

246
00:09:57.511 --> 00:09:58.344
<v Speaker 1>to get at is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't like sit down to pee and you </v>

247
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:00.954
<v Speaker 1>use your phone for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you would just open twitter really </v>

248
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:05.820
<v Speaker 1>fast while you were on the John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

249
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 1>And if it's cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll piss through the space and the,</v>

250
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 1>the seat in the bowl and all over my </v>
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>

251
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.440
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that happen to you still?</v>

252
00:10:14.441 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 1>They step in when I was a kid and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have like a morning wood and like,</v>

253
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.810
<v Speaker 1>cause your Dick points down into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl.</v>

254
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

255
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.300
<v Speaker 1>But you're still able to pay through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole soft.</v>

256
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

259
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to explore that.</v>

260
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>totally kidding.</v>

264
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.030

<v Speaker 1>that's never happened.</v>

265
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 1>You've never paid through the crack when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a kid.</v>

266
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.163
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad I'm not so awkward on,</v>

272
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to deal with social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

273
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.163
<v Speaker 1>you're the worst people in social media </v>
<v Speaker 1>or 30 year olds and young people in </v>

274
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 1>their late twenties like from talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the kids,</v>

275
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.403
<v Speaker 1>the kids have the best chance of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>shell on it cause they like actually </v>

276
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:03.840
<v Speaker 1>have a little bit of self awareness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of have grown up with it.</v>

277
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 1>It's the 30 year olds that pretend like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

278
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to it and becoming a suit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't believe what my friends look </v>

280
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:12.160
<v Speaker 1>like online.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It just so transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

285
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:27.720
<v Speaker 1>What everyone's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things trying to look like peachy and or</v>

<v Speaker 1>21st century.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I heard you say something that I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked is something that's been ringing </v>

290
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:41.184
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like if you ironically hate </v>

291
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really better than like if you,</v>

292
00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>ironically if you're self aware of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you'd have like,</v>

293
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really different.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No everyone,</v>

295
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:54.130

<v Speaker 1>being</v>

296
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.360
<v Speaker 2>like clickbaiting ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

297
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 2>well you still know you're still doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

298
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did that when I was 16 and 70.</v>

299
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 2>It was like by my merge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sellout.</v>

300
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:03.310

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

301
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.443
<v Speaker 2>you're still a fucking stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't being self aware of </v>

302
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:10.711
<v Speaker 2>saves you nothing the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like the ironic shit,</v>

303
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:11.803
<v Speaker 2>the most ironic shit online is like old </v>
<v Speaker 2>spice commercials and Geico commercials </v>

304
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 2>where they're going on and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a Geico commercial wink.</v>

305
00:12:18.191 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

306
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.403
<v Speaker 2>There's like dead pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a $200 million movie winking </v>

307
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 2>at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

308

<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I mean,</v>

309
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying like this sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrealist,</v>

310
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy adult swim.</v>

311
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.380

<v Speaker 2>aesthetic has been totally co opted by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all state,</v>

313
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.470
<v Speaker 2>all state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

314
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.950
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

315
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.010
<v Speaker 2>it just feels to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you,</v>

316
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:42.844
<v Speaker 2>how does making a movie compare to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>other creative endeavors that you've </v>

317
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:48.180
<v Speaker 2>done so far?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was good,</v>

318
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.023
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just desperate to work with other </v>

319
00:12:50.201 --> 00:12:51.160
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

320
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

321
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 2>stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just look to yourself.</v>

322
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:58.130
<v Speaker 2>And I was so tired of my own head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

323
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.070
<v Speaker 2>I was just so tired of my voice and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

324
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.383
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just wanted to work with people </v>

325
00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:04.270
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did theater like growing up and that's</v>

326
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:06.570
<v Speaker 2>what I really love and that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I fell in love with ships.</v>

327
00:13:06.571 --> 00:13:07.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

328
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.183
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just about working with people </v>

329
00:13:10.421 --> 00:13:12.610
<v Speaker 2>and getting out of my own head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was nice.</v>

330
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:13.444
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like trying to explore my own </v>

331
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:16.084
<v Speaker 2>anxiety by being alone on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How far it's surprisingly ended up </v>

332
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:20.560
<v Speaker 2>making it worse.</v>

333
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have problems with anxiety.</v>

334
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also have suffered from that,</v>

335
00:13:24.701 --> 00:13:25.534
<v Speaker 2>but I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you found something that's helped </v>

336
00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:27.604
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been suffering from </v>

337
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:29.734
<v Speaker 2>anxiety?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Longer in hindsight than I thought when </v>

338
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:34.690
<v Speaker 2>I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sophomore year I was in the hall in,</v>

339
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.610
<v Speaker 2>out of the hospital with stomach </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems thinking,</v>

340
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like,</v>

341
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:39.514
<v Speaker 2>I did like drank barium thinking I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>having all this like most of the poles </v>

342
00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:45.010
<v Speaker 2>in my intestines and I was just nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitting my pants every day.</v>

343
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:45.844
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it interesting that you weren't </v>

344
00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 2>aware that it was anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're feeling will,</v>

345
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:54.340
<v Speaker 2>it was so constant that I didn't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it could have been.</v>

346
00:13:54.341 --> 00:13:55.950
<v Speaker 2>It was every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

347
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 2>which actually probably should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed to anxiety,</v>

348
00:13:59.081 --> 00:13:59.561
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

349
00:13:59.561 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it really,</v>

350
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:07.410
<v Speaker 2>when I was 23,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had my first panic attack on stage and</v>

351
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 2>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

352
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.710
<v Speaker 2>How did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did the show continued?</v>

353
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.780
<v Speaker 2>It continued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had like,</v>

354
00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:14.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>push through it.</v>

355
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had about 10 onstage and shit.</v>

356
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:17.644
<v Speaker 2>What happens in that moment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You become like very self aware tunnel </v>

357
00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:22.120
<v Speaker 2>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like tunnel vision and then like,</v>

358
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>numb body and then just a total like out</v>

359
00:14:25.691 --> 00:14:28.060
<v Speaker 2>of body feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's so weird,</v>

360
00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.430
<v Speaker 2>it's so weird about it is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

361
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.470
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happening within the structure of a</v>

362
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:35.260
<v Speaker 2>show that is rich enough to but to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>

363
00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:36.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

364
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.320
<v Speaker 2>I can't even like go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

365
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.393
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling like I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to like say it ends up like I'm </v>

366
00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:43.534
<v Speaker 2>in groundhog's day and I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like I have a script they have to </v>

367
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:47.284
<v Speaker 2>keep to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have this inner monologue freaking </v>

368
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:49.624
<v Speaker 2>out and then I'm having to perform by </v>
<v Speaker 2>drowned that you're able to still like </v>

369
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 2>perform the script while having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat out of body experience.</v>

370
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

371
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.503
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like I'd be a little out of </v>

372
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 2>breath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd be the entire show for 20 minutes</v>

373
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:06.980
<v Speaker 2>would be existing like on like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhale kind of.</v>

374
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely wasn't my best work.</v>

375
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.203
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

376
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

377
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 2>do you remember for me my anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was diagnosed with generalized</v>

378
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:16.814
<v Speaker 2>anxiety disorder and I had like a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific moment of like almost breaking </v>

379
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 2>like a breaking point where it just came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of nowhere.</v>

380
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Did you have a moment like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was actually,</v>

381
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.890
<v Speaker 2>I had a panic attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

382
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.740
<v Speaker 2>in Providence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island,</v>

383
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.880
<v Speaker 2>which is funny cause like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

384
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I've taught people that went to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

385
00:15:36.321 --> 00:15:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I've heard this now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

386
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.503
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think my parents were there and </v>

387
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:41.840
<v Speaker 2>couldn't tell what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Providence,</v>

388
00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a theater,</v>

389
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:45.620
<v Speaker 2>like 3000 people had a panic attack.</v>

390
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.940
<v Speaker 2>It was really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

391
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:53.150
<v Speaker 2>then went to New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had three shows,</v>

392
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:58.050
<v Speaker 2>had a panic attack in the middle show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to see the Martian the next day and</v>

393
00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.420
<v Speaker 2>got very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very angry because I,</v>

394
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.263
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't about anxiety and I didn't </v>

395
00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:03.350
<v Speaker 2>know it felt like so perfect for my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

396
00:16:03.351 --> 00:16:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Like how is this story about a guy alone</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Mars logged in it,</v>

397
00:16:07.101 --> 00:16:09.400
<v Speaker 2>it felt so true to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it was just like about how he's</v>

398
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.170
<v Speaker 2>like a good botanists or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Movies probably chill.</v>

399
00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:13.004
<v Speaker 2>I was just in a bad place and then I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a panic attack on the train to DC the </v>

400
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.753
<v Speaker 2>next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

401
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.880
<v Speaker 2>which was another show and I had like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was like the first week of a tour,</v>

402
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:26.390
<v Speaker 2>there was like 45 shows and 50 days and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was when I was like,</v>

403
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.520
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

404
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Like this is bad and I can never do this</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

405
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

406
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the worst time of my,</v>

407
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I've had a pretty fortunate life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was definitely one of the hardest.</v>

408
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stretches of my life.</v>

409
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.160
<v Speaker 2>And like how did you kind of get through</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

410
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you find at the time,</v>

411
00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:47.570
<v Speaker 2>was it like for me it was almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbearable.</v>

412
00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:48.404
<v Speaker 2>Like I couldn't even live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like completely debilitated for </v>

413
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 2>like six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say try meditation,</v>

414
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't meditated for sure.</v>

415
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.943
<v Speaker 2>The problem is there's just a show every</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and there was like very like </v>

416
00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.340
<v Speaker 2>surreal comical things where I'd be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>googling how to deal with stage fright,</v>

417
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before a show in front of 3000 people.</v>

418
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.540
<v Speaker 2>And the answers would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry,</v>

419
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:06.374
<v Speaker 2>like if you're pr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing this in front of your </v>

420
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:11.510
<v Speaker 2>class or at town hall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people don't really care about what</v>

421
00:17:11.511 --> 00:17:11.960
<v Speaker 2>you're saying.</v>

422
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.793
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

423
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.873
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's 3000 people that have paid $40 </v>

424
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:18.890
<v Speaker 2>in her have waited like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do care.</v>

425
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:19.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It like really helped me to find out </v>

426
00:17:21.171 --> 00:17:25.300
<v Speaker 2>that like Barbara streisand struggled </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Dell.</v>

427
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Like I actually really helped too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a weird thing,</v>

428
00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:29.084
<v Speaker 2>like how you almost have to be more of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking psycho to not experience </v>

429
00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:33.560
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

430
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like being the president.</v>

431
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Like I dunno how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

432
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.233
<v Speaker 2>I've long held that you have to be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual sociopath that even want to be </v>

433
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:42.074
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

434
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.200
<v Speaker 2>So those guys don't feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel cold blooded.</v>

435
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got a good one right now.</v>

436
00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're usually pretty bad.</v>

437
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

438
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I get the feeling he's</v>

439
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.740
<v Speaker 1>not having much self awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self aware of moments right now.</v>

440
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

441
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

442
00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind,</v>

443
00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I know my body's on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

444
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meditation.</v>

445
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.170
<v Speaker 1>What did you do dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is like I'm not,</v>

446
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.023
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a somewhat sensitive guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason I never talked to </v>

447
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:12.270
<v Speaker 1>anyone about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>

448
00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.153
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say I was my biggest mistake </v>

449
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.000
<v Speaker 1>and that's what fucked me up for long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And looking back in hindsight,</v>

450
00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't I,</v>

451
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.930
<v Speaker 1>why was I so private about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I thought I was,</v>

452
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was actually having like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotic break.</v>

453
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.713
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was almost for sure that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was schizophrenia and I was so crushed </v>

454
00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:35.691
<v Speaker 1>by that fact and I felt like I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>crush my parents by telling them that.</v>

455
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.573
<v Speaker 1>And I felt just like I couldn't talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it at all and I held onto it just </v>

456
00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:42.120
<v Speaker 1>hoping it would go away.</v>

457
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.240
<v Speaker 1>But it never did for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you felt this,</v>

458
00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:47.760
<v Speaker 1>like my worry was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I say it,</v>

459
00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:49.260
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

460
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I admit that I'm going through there,</v>

461
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.283
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

462
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I've spoken it and now I'll never stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>

463
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.650
<v Speaker 1>And it is for anyone worried about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the exact opposite.</v>

464
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the salvation.</v>

465
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:02.094
<v Speaker 1>So that's what helped me is when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally talked to them about it because </v>

466
00:19:05.941 --> 00:19:06.990
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

467
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.853
<v Speaker 1>it's like stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just you and your head talking to </v>

468
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:10.104
<v Speaker 1>yourself and it makes everything so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse because when you've talked to </v>

469
00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:13.920
<v Speaker 1>somebody about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

470
00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:17.850
<v Speaker 1>it's really a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very literal getting it out.</v>

471
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.170
<v Speaker 1>But then people can talk to and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

472
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.053
<v Speaker 1>you're not fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not schizophrenia and you're not </v>

473
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:24.990
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just anxiety.</v>

474
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.033
<v Speaker 1>Like the things that I hoped for myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>but wouldn't believe people were </v>

475
00:19:28.921 --> 00:19:32.310
<v Speaker 1>confirming for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the beginning of,</v>

476
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of healing.</v>

477
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.350
<v Speaker 1>But I think the thing that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed for me was having a sick,</v>

478
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.110
<v Speaker 1>like a significant other and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my wife,</v>

479
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone that really,</v>

480
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.264
<v Speaker 1>like I felt comfortable talking about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being myself and knowing that cause </v>

481
00:19:48.091 --> 00:19:51.740
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the anxiety that I had was very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like social and a lot of ways.</v>

482
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

483
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.011
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

484
00:19:53.011 --> 00:19:55.380
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of that was alleviated when you</v>

485
00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:58.110
<v Speaker 1>find someone that like you think doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

486
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're alone in it together or </v>

487
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:01.614
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can hate the world army of </v>

488
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:03.480
<v Speaker 1>two or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

489
00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get said.</v>

490
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>

491
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>

492
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I never took medicine though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but frankly I wish I did.</v>

493
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would've helped a lot.</v>

494
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I almost took Beta blockers for </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance when I felt like I was going</v>

495
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.000
<v Speaker 1>to Beta blockers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about that here.</v>

496
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the Fuck Beta </v>
<v Speaker 1>blockers,</v>

497
00:20:19.321 --> 00:20:20.154
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything and it sounds like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a nineties board game or </v>

498
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:22.831
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

499
00:20:22.831 --> 00:20:25.410
<v Speaker 1>But I really feel like doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

500
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.360
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

501
00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:30.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like the sort of my thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

502
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:35.420
<v Speaker 1>if I'm being truly honest with myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the two sides of the same coin</v>

503
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:36.743
<v Speaker 1>that like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by speaking it out loud and seeing that </v>

504
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:39.930
<v Speaker 1>other people were going through it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it ended,</v>

505
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:43.050
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't unique to my experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being because I just thought like,</v>

506
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.913
<v Speaker 1>oh it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is happening to me because I'm </v>

507
00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:47.540
<v Speaker 1>living an insane life in a very specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>

508
00:20:47.541 --> 00:20:48.374
<v Speaker 1>You know</v>

509
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 2>what I spoke and I realize like it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>two things.</v>

510
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 2>It was the thing I was most terrified of</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing that actually saved me,</v>

511
00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:55.990
<v Speaker 2>which is like I'm not unique and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>

512
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was maybe deep down wanting it</v>

513
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:01.990
<v Speaker 2>to be singular because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just,</v>

514
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:02.824
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to have a very singular </v>

515
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 2>experience when I'm going through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can understand.</v>

516
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.593
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that sort of mindset is </v>

517
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:09.724
<v Speaker 2>common too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anxious people and an idea of of it is </v>

518
00:21:13.571 --> 00:21:14.404
<v Speaker 2>so visceral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of describe it like having </v>

519
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 2>anxiety feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

520
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.770
<v Speaker 2>like I'm riding a bull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my bull is a nurse,</v>

521
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.230
<v Speaker 2>my nervous system and I just have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold onto it.</v>

522
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:27.663
<v Speaker 2>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in the world feels like everyone </v>

523
00:21:29.381 --> 00:21:30.040
<v Speaker 2>else's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

524
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.210
<v Speaker 2>an equestrian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

525
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Just like perfectly in sync with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own nervous system.</v>

526
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just isn't true.</v>

527
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.393
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many silent battles of it and </v>

528
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:40.840
<v Speaker 2>absolutely for some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so weird.</v>

529
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

530
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.313
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I co I saw a little bit of my special </v>

531
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:46.000
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

532
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:46.883
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

533
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 2>make happy the last one in two years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it and I couldn't,</v>

534
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.080
<v Speaker 2>I would not believe that person was </v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous.</v>

535
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't believe I would think like,</v>

536
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.480
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about anxiety too,</v>

537
00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.800
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

538
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.450
<v Speaker 2>if he thinks it's like in and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

539
00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.650
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like he's not nervous.</v>

540
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.710
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I frankly didn't know that it was such a</v>

541
00:22:05.711 --> 00:22:10.711
<v Speaker 2>battle for you after the first show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw obed sobbed backstage because,</v>

542
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.670
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

543
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 2>I slept two hours in the night before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was shaking like um,</v>

544
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah it uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah it was,</v>

545
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:21.850
<v Speaker 2>it was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was um,</v>

546
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:22.803
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible that even through that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can still do shit cause like </v>

547
00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:26.764
<v Speaker 2>thinking back on myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't famous at the time when I was </v>

548
00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:29.910
<v Speaker 2>having my worst anxiety.</v>

549
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.953
<v Speaker 2>I still suffer from it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like back in the day I was so like </v>

550
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:39.640
<v Speaker 2>even just talking to someone was almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a a bat like a real battle for him.</v>

551
00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:40.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going on a date was like the fuck and </v>

552
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.583
<v Speaker 2>like very much like what the movie is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it describes is like these mundane </v>

553
00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:51.270
<v Speaker 2>ordinary things can sometimes be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bravest thing you can do it.</v>

554
00:22:51.271 --> 00:22:51.821
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

555
00:22:51.821 --> 00:22:52.654
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the movie was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do is like portray it very much and it </v>

556
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 2>works for third year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>

557
00:22:57.551 --> 00:22:58.384
<v Speaker 2>And it was like 13 year old life for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>13 year old or someone with social </v>

558
00:23:02.801 --> 00:23:03.634
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every tiny moments feel like life and </v>

559
00:23:05.381 --> 00:23:06.214
<v Speaker 2>death and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so important to overcome it and </v>

560
00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:09.184
<v Speaker 2>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

561
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.023
<v Speaker 2>I still have to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like that is really what </v>

562
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.520
<v Speaker 2>makes you overcome it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

563
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.061
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

564
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:16.894
<v Speaker 2>and like I just think movies tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>over us like push situations into drama </v>

565
00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:25.340
<v Speaker 2>and confrontation that that needs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>justify it.</v>

566
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I think people are so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonconfrontational in real life.</v>

567
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:30.483
<v Speaker 2>So nonconfrontational like have you ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just raised your voice at the guy </v>

568
00:23:34.311 --> 00:23:35.144
<v Speaker 2>in like the grocery store line and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>your heart is pounding for 40 minutes </v>

569
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:38.550
<v Speaker 2>afterwards?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah.</v>

570
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Like you ever seen an argument and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

571
00:23:41.051 --> 00:23:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

572
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I just think life is very,</v>

573
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 1>the drama of our lives literally plays </v>
<v Speaker 1>out very small.</v>

574
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.710
<v Speaker 1>But subjectively in personally it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

575
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:53.270
<v Speaker 1>very big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the movie was just trying to be like,</v>

576
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 1>can we show those tiny tiny moments very</v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully?</v>

577
00:23:57.441 --> 00:24:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Like the scene where she's gone to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pool party was just like,</v>

578

<v Speaker 1>I watched people and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listen to a lot of podcasts.</v>

928
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.500
<v Speaker 1>They say fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot faster pumps.</v>

929
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.690
<v Speaker 1>You can even have it sound bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell what rose of listening.</v>

930
00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:59.230
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get away from it.</v>

931
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 1>You can tell what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

932
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.413
<v Speaker 1>Bros had been listening to Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson by how all of a sudden they </v>

933
00:39:03.431 --> 00:39:08.090
<v Speaker 1>start saying presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of saying presupposition.</v>

934
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool Bruh.</v>

935
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I know where you got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

936

938
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.530
<v Speaker 1>just a man to come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not fascinating at all.</v>

939
00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Not um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:19.563

<v Speaker 1>the presupposition was that you weren't </v>

941
00:39:20.721 --> 00:39:21.554
<v Speaker 1>going to come in here.</v>

942
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.240
<v Speaker 1>This was pre suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

950
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:48.190

<v Speaker 1>that a Hashtag Hashtag viral viral,</v>

953
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:58.390
<v Speaker 1>There was such thing as real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it was real viral videos and</v>

954
00:39:58.391 --> 00:40:00.070
<v Speaker 1>viral videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

956
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.330
<v Speaker 1>From the depths of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

957
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:07.060
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit of Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libyan cannot go viral.</v>

958
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:09.940
<v Speaker 1>James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I'd love to check it.</v>

959
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.670
<v Speaker 1>You can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not virality of virus.</v>

960
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a dude fucked a monkey.</v>

961
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.100
<v Speaker 1>He got aids and from the depths of out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere,</v>

962
00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.800
<v Speaker 1>aids was born exactly viral.</v>

963
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:21.851
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

964
00:40:21.851 --> 00:40:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I got a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

965
00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:24.760
<v Speaker 1>well the has been around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

966
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.560
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird analogy.</v>

967
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe,</v>

968
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.753
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like you have 8 million </v>

969
00:40:32.681 --> 00:40:33.514
<v Speaker 1>subscribers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of your subscribers saw your </v>

970
00:40:35.561 --> 00:40:37.000
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't go viral.</v>

971
00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

972
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

973
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:39.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

974
00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.713
<v Speaker 1>my question is do viral videos still </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists because I don't see that </v>

975
00:40:43.331 --> 00:40:44.800
<v Speaker 1>happening anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

976
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.020
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think like,</v>

977
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would would've worked.</v>

978
00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:50.883
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would have been </v>

979
00:40:51.221 --> 00:40:52.180
<v Speaker 1>discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bummer.</v>

980
00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

981
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.680
<v Speaker 1>We do think cause youtube turned into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking studio and a and the network and</v>

982
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.770
<v Speaker 1>you go to the trending page and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking late night,</v>

983
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.160
<v Speaker 1>late night clips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie trailers and music videos.</v>

984
00:41:06.161 --> 00:41:07.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

985
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.650
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when we started,</v>

986
00:41:08.651 --> 00:41:10.750
<v Speaker 1>it was like this was going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's medium.</v>

987
00:41:10.751 --> 00:41:13.300
<v Speaker 1>It was like cool and different and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

988
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

989
00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:17.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't either.</v>

990
00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:18.011
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

991
00:41:18.011 --> 00:41:18.844
<v Speaker 1>just don't put that shit there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't need the fucking views and </v>

992
00:41:21.431 --> 00:41:23.770
<v Speaker 1>the best they do is like support their </v>
<v Speaker 1>creators.</v>

993
00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:26.850
<v Speaker 1>But are they supporting like no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

994
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:27.783
<v Speaker 1>the little creators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones with a bunch of subscribers </v>

995
00:41:31.661 --> 00:41:33.620
<v Speaker 1>don't need help and I don't the </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifics.</v>

996
00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I know people</v>

997
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 2>are getting fucked over specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

998
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:36.374
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like the class of 2006 to </v>

999
00:41:39.171 --> 00:41:42.640
<v Speaker 2>11 rows or whatever and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

1000
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I think it's hard to become anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1001
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I think like the established,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to break through.</v>

1002
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the only people that I see breaking </v>

1003
00:41:50.001 --> 00:41:55.001
<v Speaker 2>through now are basically people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>producing.</v>

1004
00:41:56.511 --> 00:42:01.511
<v Speaker 2>Just really just really the worst stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very easily consumable.</v>

1005
00:42:03.981 --> 00:42:04.814
<v Speaker 2>That's very clickable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the thumbnail and the title are </v>

1006
00:42:07.461 --> 00:42:09.230
<v Speaker 2>so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's walk through that.</v>

1007
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:10.064
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like people start there and then </v>

1008
00:42:12.351 --> 00:42:13.400
<v Speaker 2>work backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money.</v>

1009
00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:14.234
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I remember I all my videos are </v>

1010
00:42:15.141 --> 00:42:19.750
<v Speaker 2>posted like lowercase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the title of the song you mean?</v>

1011
00:42:19.751 --> 00:42:23.990
<v Speaker 2>And I remember like even me later in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>clips I had to do big capital Bo Burnham</v>

1012
00:42:23.991 --> 00:42:24.980
<v Speaker 2>hd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck.</v>

1013
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1014
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.270
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like bill worst bill wirtz,</v>

1015
00:42:29.271 --> 00:42:32.060
<v Speaker 2>the guy that did the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is the one exception.</v>

1016
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I think there are some others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there are.</v>

1017
00:42:35.061 --> 00:42:35.661
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1018
00:42:35.661 --> 00:42:37.850
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1019
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.730
<v Speaker 2>it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it's not the kids,</v>

1020
00:42:40.731 --> 00:42:44.060
<v Speaker 2>the specific people posting themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't a value.</v>

1021
00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:47.120
<v Speaker 2>It's just I think the value system or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that's like,</v>

1022
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.580
<v Speaker 2>that you're taught to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1023
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it encourages people to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative like it used to.</v>

1024
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or got out of the way.</v>

1025
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

1026
00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:59.490
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1027
00:42:59.491 --> 00:43:00.324
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was all going to turn </v>

1028
00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:02.180
<v Speaker 2>into blogging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1029
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.250
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool if you've logged,</v>

1030
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.000
<v Speaker 2>but like even musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on youtube,</v>

1031
00:43:07.001 --> 00:43:09.500
<v Speaker 2>they're like little indie musicians </v>
<v Speaker 2>start their music video with like,</v>

1032
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.240
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my music video.</v>

1033
00:43:11.241 --> 00:43:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I hope you check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it cuts and I'm like,</v>

1034
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:13.964
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem is that Youtube's </v>

1035
00:43:15.711 --> 00:43:16.544
<v Speaker 2>algorithm favors lots like daily or even</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than daily uploads of basically to </v>

1036
00:43:24.891 --> 00:43:25.724
<v Speaker 2>succeed on Youtube in this environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to post like every day and fan </v>

1037
00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:30.440
<v Speaker 2>engagement.</v>

1038
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is kind of like crazy terms.</v>

1039
00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:33.094
<v Speaker 2>That's just like what's on top right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's what youtube is selected </v>

1040
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:40.640
<v Speaker 2>probably inadvertently to dominate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1041
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.760
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that there shouldn't be that.</v>

1042
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:47.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are people yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>included who are very good at commentary</v>

1043
00:43:47.481 --> 00:43:48.314
<v Speaker 2>who should be posting a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that should be one part of an </v>

1044
00:43:51.471 --> 00:43:52.304
<v Speaker 2>ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying in theory this thing is just </v>

1045
00:43:54.411 --> 00:43:55.730
<v Speaker 2>a blank medium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1046
00:43:55.731 --> 00:43:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Where anything can post where anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

1047
00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.430
<v Speaker 2>I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just remembered in 2006 being like,</v>

1048
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:02.293
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what youtube is going to be </v>

1049
00:44:03.651 --> 00:44:04.484
<v Speaker 2>like in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like all the Oscar </v>

1050
00:44:05.931 --> 00:44:06.890
<v Speaker 2>winning shorts are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1051
00:44:06.891 --> 00:44:07.724
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if it's not the </v>

1052
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.133
<v Speaker 2>Oscars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying it's going be like </v>

1053
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:13.610
<v Speaker 2>people are going to be uploading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1054
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I made my special,</v>

1055
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:16.603
<v Speaker 2>I made this big thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to post it for free on </v>

1056
00:44:19.371 --> 00:44:20.240
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1057
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:21.074
<v Speaker 2>and then give it to Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I took way less of a pay so I could </v>

1058
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:26.960
<v Speaker 2>post referring on Youtube and I posted </v>
<v Speaker 2>it for free on youtube.</v>

1059
00:44:26.961 --> 00:44:29.420
<v Speaker 2>But I realized like the environment had </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed so much that like,</v>

1060
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one even thought I was posting.</v>

1061
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 2>They just thought it was like a rip</v>

1062
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.150
<v Speaker 1>from Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1063
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:34.243
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place doesn't even exist for that </v>

1064
00:44:35.311 --> 00:44:36.180
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1065
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.220
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you see fucking,</v>

1066
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1067
00:44:39.121 --> 00:44:40.800
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure there's some really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1068
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be shitting on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1069
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.480
<v Speaker 1>these are things I struggle with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are pressures,</v>

1070
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 1>pressures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel.</v>

1071
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

1072
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:50.491
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around town,</v>

1073
00:44:50.491 --> 00:44:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I see billboards for youtube red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1074
00:44:52.021 --> 00:44:54.420
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a Disney channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like isn't this place the wild west?</v>

1075
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:55.254
<v Speaker 1>Isn't this like totally free?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are we imposing like wire and it </v>

1076
00:44:58.531 --> 00:44:59.364
<v Speaker 1>feels like creators themselves are </v>
<v Speaker 1>inviting like the archaic standards of </v>

1077
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:05.784
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can be so much freer than </v>

1078
00:45:08.941 --> 00:45:09.960
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think.</v>

1079
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you making?</v>

1080
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that,</v>

1081
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:14.813
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at someone like filthy </v>

1082
00:45:15.661 --> 00:45:16.494
<v Speaker 1>frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if here that know who that </v>

1083
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:18.533
<v Speaker 1>he was someone who kind of embodied what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about where he was very </v>

1084
00:45:20.911 --> 00:45:21.960
<v Speaker 1>much his own man.</v>

1085
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.460
<v Speaker 1>He very much did his own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't conform to any anything.</v>

1086
00:45:26.461 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 1>It was just totally fucking nuts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody loved it.</v>

1087
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.520
<v Speaker 1>But the problem was that he was always </v>
<v Speaker 1>being demonetized.</v>

1088
00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:33.354
<v Speaker 1>Youtube was always fucking with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and in a way that didn't really </v>

1089
00:45:35.461 --> 00:45:37.480
<v Speaker 1>make it sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to love shoe.</v>

1090
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who like use your nice drink glue.</v>

1091
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.633
<v Speaker 1>It was hold a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you say to shoot and I says </v>

1092
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.320
<v Speaker 1>he's a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legend.</v>

1093
00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:47.970
<v Speaker 1>He called Isla and Israeli con once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to kill her or something.</v>

1094
00:45:47.971 --> 00:45:49.400
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh nice.</v>

1095
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:51.590
<v Speaker 1>We still had in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>

1096

<v Speaker 1>we always said thank yeah that,</v>

1097
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:56.880
<v Speaker 1>oh he's the greatest isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it just like,</v>

1098
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:58.103
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you and I says he's not killing it </v>

1099
00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:01.950
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he's killing,</v>

1100
00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.180
<v Speaker 1>well he is living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's killed but not,</v>

1101
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.940
<v Speaker 1>but like I'm just saying it should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>weirder.</v>

1102
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:08.783
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I that that that's all I just mean it </v>

1103
00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:11.394
<v Speaker 1>should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm glad he said bell works because </v>

1104
00:46:13.261 --> 00:46:15.960
<v Speaker 1>that does kind of our works and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>

1105
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I know that there's like hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1106
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:22.170
<v Speaker 1>thousands of the just the system isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>in place too.</v>

1107
00:46:22.171 --> 00:46:23.004
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like what I'm saying really </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not going after the people making </v>

1108
00:46:27.091 --> 00:46:32.040
<v Speaker 1>stuff and even the people making stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be so much better if the,</v>

1109
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:35.160
<v Speaker 1>if the medium itself was encouraging </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual creative expression.</v>

1110
00:46:35.161 --> 00:46:38.250
<v Speaker 1>I wish they had a department or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of dedication to doing that.</v>

1111
00:46:38.251 --> 00:46:39.600
<v Speaker 1>But as far as I'm aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

1112
00:46:39.601 --> 00:46:41.570
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's value.</v>

1113
00:46:41.571 --> 00:46:42.404
<v Speaker 1>Why are a bunch of NBC executives like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that work at youtube or like </v>

1114
00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:47.160
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of fucking dusty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1115
00:46:47.161 --> 00:46:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't be saying this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever,</v>

1116
00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:50.070
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm friends with them.</v>

1117
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:50.611
<v Speaker 1>They know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know.</v>

1118
00:46:50.611 --> 00:46:51.444
<v Speaker 1>We all hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1119
00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I live with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1120
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you walk into Youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>headquarters and you're like,</v>

1121
00:46:54.961 --> 00:46:58.180
<v Speaker 1>is this the m and m store?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck Emma me,</v>

1122
00:46:58.210 --> 00:46:59.860
<v Speaker 1>me and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1123
00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:04.880
<v Speaker 1>The Internet to me is like dirty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird and crazy and like so human.</v>

1124
00:47:06.121 --> 00:47:08.370
<v Speaker 1>And if you did it just scratch past the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface,</v>

1125
00:47:08.371 --> 00:47:09.204
<v Speaker 1>you fall in that side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem that's happening is </v>

1126
00:47:10.381 --> 00:47:11.214
<v Speaker 1>that like with net neutrality and all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff going on is that people </v>

1127
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:17.310
<v Speaker 1>don't want the Internet to be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty,</v>

1128
00:47:17.311 --> 00:47:19.590
<v Speaker 1>crusty place anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want it to be,</v>

1129
00:47:19.591 --> 00:47:20.424
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buttoned up and they want it to be </v>

1130
00:47:21.511 --> 00:47:25.140
<v Speaker 1>predictable and they want it to be a not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just another thing.</v>

1131
00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

1132
00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.770
<v Speaker 1>that's where the movement is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going.</v>

1133
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1134
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.823
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard because I'm on both sides a </v>

1135
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:33.094
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I also look at the Internet and </v>

1136
00:47:33.881 --> 00:47:34.714
<v Speaker 2>don't go like the only problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet isn't that it needs to be </v>

1137
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 2>freer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1138
00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1139
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.500
<v Speaker 2>there is also crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1140
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:42.363
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if any of us should be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to watch like people blow their heads </v>

1141

<v Speaker 2>what do you think of,</v>

1152
00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:08.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you came up on youtube,</v>

1153
00:48:08.591 --> 00:48:12.040
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't such a notion as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Internet celebrity or youtube.</v>

1154
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:12.580
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1155
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.400
<v Speaker 2>when there wasn't a standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't like a thing you should be,</v>

1156
00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:17.110
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1157
00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:18.663
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a format,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was just like people just doing </v>

1158
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:23.890
<v Speaker 2>random shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unpolished,</v>

1159
00:48:23.891 --> 00:48:25.810
<v Speaker 2>random shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is cool,</v>

1160
00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:27.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to like,</v>

1161
00:48:27.131 --> 00:48:28.210
<v Speaker 2>if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1162
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.193
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1163
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.840
<v Speaker 2>what do you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>

1164
00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.270
<v Speaker 2>The old dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

1165
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:33.370
<v Speaker 2>but I am I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1166
00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:35.130
<v Speaker 2>but I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am across the old due to the,</v>

1167
00:48:35.131 --> 00:48:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was in 2006 right when this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing started,</v>

1168
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:41.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's because I care about it so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I want,</v>

1169
00:48:41.891 --> 00:48:42.724
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young people that are taking risks and </v>

1170
00:48:44.411 --> 00:48:47.670
<v Speaker 2>making interesting things to like have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>s and it's,</v>

1171
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:48.603
<v Speaker 2>I say this because I care about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because like every other medium has no </v>

1172
00:48:51.521 --> 00:48:54.010
<v Speaker 2>fucking chance of being cool.</v>

1173
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1174
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:55.743
<v Speaker 2>this is like the first like real medium </v>
<v Speaker 2>where like everyone can actually access </v>

1175
00:49:00.611 --> 00:49:05.410
<v Speaker 2>it and like the viral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the idea of viral is,</v>

1176
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:06.280
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>

1177
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.173
<v Speaker 2>is a problem cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it immediately puts the idea that </v>

1178
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.640
<v Speaker 2>the only things worthy are the ones that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1179
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.240
<v Speaker 2>that are um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being seen like a million times.</v>

1180
00:49:16.241 --> 00:49:17.074
<v Speaker 2>You've got to find really cool channels </v>
<v Speaker 2>with like 3000 views where it's some </v>

1181
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:23.170
<v Speaker 2>person giving advice or some person </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching piano and like,</v>

1182
00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well originally that's why youtube was </v>

1183
00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:25.594
<v Speaker 2>all about was just a dude who wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make shit and share it with like their </v>

1184
00:49:29.741 --> 00:49:31.060
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1185
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:36.640
<v Speaker 2>that's why people made videos and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early days before you got paid for it.</v>

1186
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.510
<v Speaker 2>But now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 95% of kids,</v>

1187
00:49:40.511 --> 00:49:42.760
<v Speaker 2>if you ask them what's their dream job </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to be a youtuber.</v>

1188
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that pretty strange,</v>

1189
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.883
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1190
00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.980
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people want it to be astronauts.</v>

1191
00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:49.773
<v Speaker 2>Will you tubers weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it feels like it's like movie or </v>

1192
00:49:52.151 --> 00:49:53.470
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that would just be like moving,</v>

1193
00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:54.693
<v Speaker 2>but youtube or it's weird that when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say youtube or that should have no </v>

1194
00:49:56.711 --> 00:49:57.580
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1195
00:49:57.581 --> 00:50:02.140
<v Speaker 2>That should actually be like something </v>
<v Speaker 2>less diverse amount should be writers.</v>

1196
00:50:02.141 --> 00:50:02.531
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1197
00:50:02.531 --> 00:50:04.420
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to write?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you say youtube or it's like,</v>

1198
00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:06.140
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means like Hawkeye image.</v>

1199
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this for that.</v>

1200
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:10.390
<v Speaker 2>You know that that's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think that's true,</v>

1201
00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:13.480
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it actually is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

1202
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:14.553
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think will be your neighbors that </v>

1203
00:50:15.791 --> 00:50:16.750
<v Speaker 2>are getting attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1204
00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what they mean.</v>

1205
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1206
00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:23.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all fucking losers.</v>

1207
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:25.900
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know what you mean.</v>

1208
00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I love Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love so of what it was.</v>

1209
00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what it is and like I get,</v>

1210
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

1211
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:34.904
<v Speaker 2>So I'm saying if kids are happy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's happy doing this shit and </v>

1212
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:38.660
<v Speaker 2>people are happy watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like totally cool.</v>

1213
00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1214
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.333
<v Speaker 2>and I need to emphasize it like the real</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing I'm pissed about is not that </v>

1215
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:47.623
<v Speaker 2>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube creators are taking this space </v>

1216
00:50:48.681 --> 00:50:51.060
<v Speaker 2>from these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real thing are the movie studios,</v>

1217
00:50:51.061 --> 00:50:53.600
<v Speaker 2>the movie trailers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tonight show clips that like that is</v>

1218
00:50:53.601 --> 00:50:55.730
<v Speaker 2>the most infuriating thing when you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1219
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:58.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that uh,</v>

1220
00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Shane Dawson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tana con thing was awesome.</v>

1221
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:06.270
<v Speaker 2>It was so cool that that was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like what an incredible thing to do.</v>

1222
00:51:06.741 --> 00:51:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Like form breaking any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so good.</v>

1223
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Like I was blown away and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was part and,</v>

1224
00:51:13.051 --> 00:51:16.640
<v Speaker 2>and because of like Shane's personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with his odd,</v>

1225
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:17.503
<v Speaker 2>it was that much more meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a great like version of </v>

1226
00:51:19.611 --> 00:51:21.230
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Louis throw weird version.</v>

1227
00:51:21.231 --> 00:51:22.350
<v Speaker 2>So that was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:24.380
<v Speaker 2>So I know people are doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be like,</v>

1229
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:25.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I dunno like Kevin Hart doing like </v>

1230
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:32.570
<v Speaker 2>vanity fairs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most viral questions,</v>

1231
00:51:32.571 --> 00:51:33.404
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1232
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:36.770
<v Speaker 2>It's tough and all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no hate to any specific people.</v>

1233
00:51:36.771 --> 00:51:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I can't believe it.</v>

1234
00:51:38.991 --> 00:51:40.070
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it.</v>

1235
00:51:40.071 --> 00:51:40.904
<v Speaker 2>Like they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people sit in a room and they go </v>

1236
00:51:42.891 --> 00:51:44.330
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we make something viral?</v>

1237
00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:45.403
<v Speaker 2>And they make it and it goes viral </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they called it viral in their </v>

1238
00:51:48.261 --> 00:51:50.120
<v Speaker 2>headline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you like he said,</v>

1239
00:51:50.121 --> 00:51:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that means anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1240
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Like viral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was just back in the day,</v>

1241
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:56.700
<v Speaker 2>it was like there's a viral video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yodel bowl,</v>

1242
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:58.910
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a double rainbow.</v>

1243
00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.490
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a viral video.</v>

1244
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:05.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a guy fucking tripping balls over a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cup.</v>

1245
00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1246
00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:08.423
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's tripping balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's just deeply that that guy </v>

1247
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.190
<v Speaker 2>was a trip to the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>

1248
00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I personally think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a time time old who goes the</v>

1249
00:52:17.511 --> 00:52:20.840
<v Speaker 2>dynamite boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the best of all time,</v>

1250
00:52:20.841 --> 00:52:25.310
<v Speaker 2>one of the best of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like it's similar with the movie,</v>

1251
00:52:25.311 --> 00:52:28.130
<v Speaker 2>which is like cringe means a lot to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1252
00:52:28.131 --> 00:52:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's some like I love like,</v>

1253
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.740
<v Speaker 2>and like our cringe and that all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff is,</v>

1254
00:52:33.741 --> 00:52:34.574
<v Speaker 2>it gets a little dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why the cringe communities </v>

1255
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:40.450
<v Speaker 2>sometimes can be very mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like all the videos but I,</v>

1256
00:52:40.451 --> 00:52:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I re they're like deeply beautiful to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1257
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:46.100
<v Speaker 2>They're deeply vulnerable and wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and meaningful.</v>

1258
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:46.963
<v Speaker 2>Tristan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying like some people would watch </v>

1259
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:50.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that weird hot dog video,</v>

1260
00:52:50.241 --> 00:52:51.074
<v Speaker 2>the guy blending the things and want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like tell him to kill himself or </v>

1261
00:52:52.831 --> 00:52:53.664
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's like just so beautiful </v>

1262
00:52:54.861 --> 00:52:55.694
<v Speaker 2>that we have access to people's most </v>
<v Speaker 2>mortifying moments and I feel for them </v>

1263
00:52:57.561 --> 00:53:01.130
<v Speaker 2>and I think cringing is a form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy and you know,</v>

1264
00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.430
<v Speaker 2>well certainly it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1265
00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.950
<v Speaker 2>you're embarrassed for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:53:03.951 --> 00:53:05.210
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1267
00:53:05.211 --> 00:53:07.070
<v Speaker 2>and it's vulnerable and like that boom </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes the dynamite.</v>

1268
00:53:07.071 --> 00:53:07.904
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is me on stage if I just wasn't as </v>

1269
00:53:11.181 --> 00:53:13.580
<v Speaker 2>good or what an r or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

00:58:05.221 --> 00:58:06.054
<v Speaker 1>but also people are too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a certain level of </v>

1388
00:58:08.161 --> 00:58:10.710
<v Speaker 1>maturity to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this guy and not be like,</v>

1390
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:13.583
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most people probably over the </v>

1391
00:58:15.811 --> 00:58:20.811
<v Speaker 1>age of 20 or like having sympathy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>repulsed in just whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm trying it,</v>

1397
00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:29.340
<v Speaker 1>which is that towards the end</v>

1398
00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:33.280
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:57.310
<v Speaker 1>So am I correct me if I'm wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't blend the dogs.</v>

1409

<v Speaker 1>He sliced them little bites and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he did he blend it and put it into </v>

<v Speaker 1>the already blended peaches?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1411
00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:07.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1412
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to get the recipe </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>

1413
00:59:09.371 --> 00:59:14.340
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm gonna get this at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either course cleanups,</v>

1414
00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:15.183
<v Speaker 1>a breeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just leave everything there for 10 </v>

1415
00:59:17.201 --> 00:59:18.040
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1416
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

1417
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm suspicious of this.</v>

1418
00:59:34.591 --> 00:59:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Can I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1419
00:59:36.091 --> 00:59:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in what way?</v>

1420
00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it's might be an art piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1421
00:59:41.371 --> 00:59:43.130
<v Speaker 1>it's an art piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But regardless,</v>

1422
00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this guy is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he might be an actor.</v>

1423
00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:46.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1424
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:46.911
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1425
00:59:46.911 --> 00:59:47.970
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1426
00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Way Too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Specifical good way to spin.</v>

1427
00:59:50.491 --> 00:59:51.324
<v Speaker 1>He hates it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pours it out and yet still uploads </v>

1428
00:59:54.601 --> 00:59:55.440
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1429
00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Now you're getting now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're getting it.</v>

1430
00:59:57.121 --> 00:59:58.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it that they're all,</v>

1431
00:59:58.650 --> 00:59:59.483
<v Speaker 1>they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can show you a video of a nine year </v>

1432
01:00:01.291 --> 01:00:02.124
<v Speaker 1>old that has a claw machine in his house</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause his mother like s like put a </v>

1433
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:06.743
<v Speaker 1>reverse mortgage on her house to buy him</v>
<v Speaker 1>a claw machine that also looks like an </v>

1434
01:00:09.271 --> 01:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>art piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe this that they're like Ian,</v>

1435
01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:14.520
<v Speaker 1>pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really going to be hard to find.</v>

1436
01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>That was like super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it's like claw machine.</v>

1437
01:00:19.411 --> 01:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is just that this,</v>

1438
01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not saying that it's for sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake,</v>

1439
01:00:23.551 --> 01:00:24.384
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is this predates kind of the </v>

1440
01:00:26.791 --> 01:00:27.624
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so skeptical of everything I see on </v>

1441
01:00:29.911 --> 01:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>the Internet to the point where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1442
01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1443
01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:33.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1444
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.823
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1445
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring all the fucking shit under there.</v>

1446
01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>

1447
01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>why is there a toilet in the bowl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is there a toilet in the room?</v>

1448
01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>He said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes to the bathroom.</v>

1449
01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Why is he cooks in the bathroom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1450
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Where does he live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he live in the bathroom?</v>

1451
01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:47.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to just take the whole thing as </v>

1452
01:00:49.501 --> 01:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>a package.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can pick and choose,</v>

1453
01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1454
01:00:52.531 --> 01:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen red flag.</v>

1455
01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:55.621
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1456
01:00:55.621 --> 01:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>So he's cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hot dogs and peaches.</v>

1457
01:00:57.721 --> 01:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>And you're confused that he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom to get the water?</v>

1458
01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also perfect.</v>

1459
01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:03.203
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be that hard to throw some </v>
<v Speaker 1>tostitos and aback and bathroom right </v>

1460
01:01:07.501 --> 01:01:08.334
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1461
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:10.170
<v Speaker 1>either way I listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1462
01:01:10.171 --> 01:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's real.</v>

1463
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:13.463
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like of all the conspiracies I've had </v>

1464
01:01:15.481 --> 01:01:17.030
<v Speaker 1>to walk people through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1465
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm a much happier to do this then like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>

1466
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>

1467
01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.373
<v Speaker 1>I think the moon's real as far as I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend does not think the moon is </v>

1468
01:01:24.991 --> 01:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a moon Downer.</v>

1469
01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Deeply deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would,</v>

1470
01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>he would draw drawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend drawn Carmichael,</v>

1471
01:01:30.391 --> 01:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>who I did special for your trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very,</v>

1472
01:01:32.431 --> 01:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1473
01:01:33.301 --> 01:01:34.134
<v Speaker 1>what's the story about the mountain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's not real or does he </v>

1474
01:01:36.211 --> 01:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>actually think it's like a Hologram?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1475
01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:39.124
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll going to the moon never </v>

1476
01:01:40.051 --> 01:01:40.884
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1477
01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be done.</v>

1478
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1479
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:44.423
<v Speaker 1>They're going to the moon in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you still believe that in this </v>

1480
01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:47.430
<v Speaker 1>day and age?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really blows my mind.</v>

1481
01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>He can make a good case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1482
01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>You want to try to convince me he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>do a good job?</v>

1483
01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1484
01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Moana is fake,</v>

1485
01:01:56.521 --> 01:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard it.</v>

1486
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:59.810
<v Speaker 1>The moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's doesn't exist at all.</v>

1487
01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.153
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

1488
01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.520
<v Speaker 4>I do want to see how this ends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I can be frank with you.</v>

1489
01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:06.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks very real.</v>

1490
01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:07.670
<v Speaker 4>Everything okay?</v>

1491
01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.630
<v Speaker 1>If it's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the greatest production designer of</v>

1492
01:02:10.631 --> 01:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1493
01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Like it's beautifully put together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1494
01:02:13.991 --> 01:02:16.870
<v Speaker 1>This guy would be going places right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he would be like,</v>

1495
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just like incredibly up the flat,</v>

1496
01:02:20.881 --> 01:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>the two flashlights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

1497
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1498
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.313
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1499
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1500
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not American.</v>

1501
01:02:30.301 --> 01:02:30.931
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1502

<v Speaker 1>comedians sitting around performing.</v>

1620
01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucking,</v>

1621
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:09.543
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that I ever being just mean like </v>

1622
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:13.280
<v Speaker 1>everyone tried to outdo each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1623
01:07:13.281 --> 01:07:17.290
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that situation was something</v>

1624
01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:18.900
<v Speaker 1>that I would hate to ever be involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1625
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:23.140
<v Speaker 1>just cause it's like so competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be.</v>

1626
01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.093
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to compete to like </v>

1627
01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:27.423
<v Speaker 1>prove how funny or witty you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just sit there like a fucking idiot </v>

1628
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.280
<v Speaker 1>doing bits in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets very,</v>

1629
01:07:33.281 --> 01:07:34.360
<v Speaker 1>very exhausting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was actually kind of a fun one </v>

1631
01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:38.740
<v Speaker 1>because I was so young and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1632
01:07:38.741 --> 01:07:39.574

<v Speaker 1>you felt when you were younger that need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I feel the same exact way.</v>

1668
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:07.490
<v Speaker 1>There's something about when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>young and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>than you that are religious so it isn't </v>

1672
01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.560
<v Speaker 1>inherently a dumb idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>subjective experience.</v>

1677
01:09:30.021 --> 01:09:33.080
<v Speaker 1>It's so mind blowingly impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>when I'm in the city,</v>

1708
01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.713
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to a church and sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll sit down through the thing </v>

1709
01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.400
<v Speaker 1>usually like on off hours because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1710
01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.780
<v Speaker 1>why do you go there?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Contemplating.</v>

1712
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:50.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find that the environment does </v>

1713
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:54.050
<v Speaker 1>something quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1714
01:10:54.051 --> 01:10:54.884
<v Speaker 1>the church I've been to churches and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cathedrals and there's definitely a </v>

1715
01:10:57.771 --> 01:10:58.420
<v Speaker 1>vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1716
01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.540
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1717
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:02.840
<v Speaker 1>and like you really can't be on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone when you're in there.</v>

1718
01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:03.733
<v Speaker 1>It's not even about God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost just about like the </v>

1719
01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:09.170
<v Speaker 1>quietness of like just being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something divine in existence.</v>

1720
01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say agree we don't agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just say I think that,</v>

1721
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1722
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.813
<v Speaker 2>like you really feel that there and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't have to believe in Jesus </v>

1723
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:18.263
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to look at a guy in a </v>

1724
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 2>cross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something divine about being</v>

1725
01:11:20.731 --> 01:11:21.564
<v Speaker 2>alive and you feel that there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like silence is as valuable as its </v>

1726
01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:29.160
<v Speaker 2>ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like silent attention is like so rare to</v>

1727
01:11:29.161 --> 01:11:32.020
<v Speaker 2>get a less stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:36.600
<v Speaker 2>can I go to a church?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Jewish by gorgeous ethnicity.</v>

1729
01:11:36.601 --> 01:11:37.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't mind,</v>

1730

<v Speaker 2>anyone's welcome at this table if you're</v>

1748
01:12:15.571 --> 01:12:16.980
<v Speaker 2>trans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're this,</v>

1749
01:12:16.981 --> 01:12:19.260
<v Speaker 2>if it was like things are changing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are changing.</v>

1750
01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Can I talk about your mom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

1751
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:24.090
<v Speaker 2>your mom has a really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocation.</v>

1752
01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.160
<v Speaker 2>She a hospice nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1753
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:28.430
<v Speaker 2>She'd been doing hospice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean stupid boss diminishes,</v>

1754
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:30.930
<v Speaker 2>which is basically she takes care of end</v>
<v Speaker 2>of life.</v>

1755
01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she works in a hospice center.</v>

1756
01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:35.200
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of hospice nurses are out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1757
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll go to,</v>

1758
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:39.240
<v Speaker 2>they'll go to a dying patient in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>

1759
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:40.103
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where dying patients come and </v>

1760
01:12:41.461 --> 01:12:42.330
<v Speaker 2>it's end of life care.</v>

1761
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:44.550
<v Speaker 2>So the average day is two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one recovers.</v>

1762
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.170
<v Speaker 2>You know when you go there you do not </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>

1763
01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:49.260
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see she sees three or four deaths a day.</v>

1764
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:50.183
<v Speaker 2>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious just systematically how </v>

1765
01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:55.860
<v Speaker 2>people end up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it like a health insurance thing?</v>

1766
01:12:55.861 --> 01:12:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Is it like a government thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1767
01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:00.360
<v Speaker 2>that's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1768
01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:02.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1769
01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:03.773
<v Speaker 2>it's when the dying process starts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's when the illness is fully </v>

1770
01:13:07.921 --> 01:13:11.490
<v Speaker 2>move Oli terminal moving out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital and into,</v>

1771
01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:14.490
<v Speaker 2>into a place where it's called end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life care,</v>

1772
01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:15.324
<v Speaker 2>where you're just trying to make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable and think about how that </v>

1773
01:13:17.881 --> 01:13:19.740
<v Speaker 2>came into exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it part of the hospital?</v>

1774
01:13:19.741 --> 01:13:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Like who runs that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

1779
01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:35.963
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually just nurses going to take </v>

<v Speaker 2>this sort of thing.</v>

1782
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:43.230
<v Speaker 2>A hospice center is much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much rare,</v>

1783
01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.700
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of donations and things.</v>

1784
01:13:44.701 --> 01:13:46.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean like it's not just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>too as well.</v>

01:16:16.481 --> 01:16:17.314
<v Speaker 2>they're two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1850
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:18.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's just end of life care.</v>

1851
01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:21.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not about they're venting and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>also very medical.</v>

1852
01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:23.300
<v Speaker 2>She's also like a nurse practitioner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's a,</v>

1853
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.070
<v Speaker 2>she knows what she's worked in the Er,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's done these things.</v>

1854
01:16:27.071 --> 01:16:28.260
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1855
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's wild.</v>

1856
01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:30.993
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gotta be one of the craziest </v>

1857
01:16:32.141 --> 01:16:35.230
<v Speaker 2>fucking jobs you can possibly be for </v>
<v Speaker 2>family members showing up.</v>

1858
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Like threatening to fucking kill people.</v>

1859
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Like get my dad out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be what?</v>

1860
01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:39.994
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fucking not adding to terms with it </v>

1861
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:45.160
<v Speaker 2>or like they don't want them here or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're confused or they're,</v>

1862
01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:47.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1863
01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.040
<v Speaker 2>well I can say just from like my wife </v>
<v Speaker 2>Isla is going through something with her</v>

1864
01:16:53.381 --> 01:16:56.800
<v Speaker 2>dad right now and like just hearing her </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it is like,</v>

1865
01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:59.560
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just so fucked up.</v>

1866
01:16:59.561 --> 01:17:00.394
<v Speaker 2>Like we're so bad at dealing with death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't think about it until it's </v>

1867
01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:05.380
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like these women,</v>

1868
01:17:05.381 --> 01:17:06.500
<v Speaker 2>these nurses that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>

1869
01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:07.343
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are like such rocks for people because </v>

1870
01:17:09.561 --> 01:17:10.394
<v Speaker 2>my mother will sit there and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knows how to deal with it and she </v>

1871
01:17:12.321 --> 01:17:15.080
<v Speaker 2>knows what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody,</v>

1872
01:17:15.081 --> 01:17:19.220
<v Speaker 2>she knows how to deal with it and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dealing with it as in like they make</v>

1873
01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:19.730
<v Speaker 2>it easier.</v>

1874
01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:20.580
<v Speaker 2>But she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll,</v>

1875
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:23.030
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she can say like,</v>

1876
01:17:23.690 --> 01:17:26.390
<v Speaker 2>she's never seen last words in her life </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

1877
01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:30.890
<v Speaker 2>She says they almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they almost never speak for the last two</v>

1878
01:17:30.891 --> 01:17:33.800
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a last breath,</v>

1879
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:36.860
<v Speaker 2>but there's almost never a last word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like really,</v>

1880
01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:39.120
<v Speaker 2>really incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly fast.</v>

1881
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:40.933
<v Speaker 2>She was on an episode of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I talked a little bit about this </v>

1882
01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:47.360
<v Speaker 2>on Marin's podcast like a long time ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1883
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Nancy Updike from this American life </v>
<v Speaker 2>herd and they did it this American life.</v>

1884
01:17:50.611 --> 01:17:51.444
<v Speaker 2>And on my ma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of it's on my mom and you can hear </v>

1885
01:17:53.421 --> 01:17:54.850
<v Speaker 2>her in the hospice center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1886
01:17:54.851 --> 01:17:56.960
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some people,</v>

1887
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sucks for her because it's such an </v>

1888
01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:03.290
<v Speaker 2>interesting job and of course it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally taxing and she needs to talk</v>

1889
01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:04.460
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

1890
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:05.323
<v Speaker 2>it's such a hard thing to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people care about and they go </v>

1891
01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:08.270
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't fucking hear that.</v>

1892
01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:09.493
<v Speaker 2>But it definitely puts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it puts my job in a perspective very </v>

1893
01:18:11.481 --> 01:18:12.000
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1894
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean where I can just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1895
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.420
<v Speaker 2>who gives a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens with,</v>

1896
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:16.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing or that like,</v>

1897
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:17.443
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if like we as a society and </v>

1898
01:18:19.671 --> 01:18:22.040
<v Speaker 2>this kind of a fucking ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>question out there,</v>

1899
01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:24.560
<v Speaker 2>but like if we just dealt with death </v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

1900
01:18:24.561 --> 01:18:26.270
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just,</v>

1901
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.133
<v Speaker 2>it's this buggy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all obviously know we're going to </v>

1902
01:18:28.731 --> 01:18:30.050
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like the thought of it,</v>

1903
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.240
<v Speaker 2>the prepping of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Association of it,</v>

1904
01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.330
<v Speaker 2>the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we prolonging it,</v>

1905
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:39.080
<v Speaker 2>even when it's over like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what this is,</v>

1906
01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.233
<v Speaker 2>is that when people are dying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're on death's bed certain to die </v>

1907
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.920
<v Speaker 2>and they're suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no quality of life.</v>

1908
01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:46.370
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1909
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:48.020
<v Speaker 2>the family suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person suffering,</v>

1910
01:18:48.021 --> 01:18:50.730
<v Speaker 2>it's like you prolonged that for as long</v>
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>

1911
01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1912
01:18:52.191 --> 01:18:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I think we've done better with grief </v>
<v Speaker 2>than we have death.</v>

1913
01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.131
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1914
01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:55.760
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1915
01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:56.593
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1916
01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.720
<v Speaker 2>there's more of an infrastructure for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the grieving process,</v>

1917
01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:00.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1918
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're,</v>

1919
01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:05.450
<v Speaker 2>we're more familiar with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying before,</v>

1920
01:19:05.451 --> 01:19:06.081
<v Speaker 2>we may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1921
01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:08.630
<v Speaker 2>we've experienced funerals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what that is,</v>

1922
01:19:08.631 --> 01:19:12.320
<v Speaker 2>we know that space a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are very public and right.</v>

1923
01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:13.154
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the dying process for people </v>

1924
01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:17.820
<v Speaker 2>unfamiliar with it is intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my grandfather,</v>

1925
01:19:17.821 --> 01:19:21.440
<v Speaker 2>my father's father died at the hospice </v>
<v Speaker 2>center my mom was working at,</v>

1926
01:19:21.441 --> 01:19:24.520
<v Speaker 2>but she couldn't work with him because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't let you work.</v>

1927
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Conflict of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1928
01:19:25.621 --> 01:19:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the,</v>

1929
01:19:26.631 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's interest,</v>

1930
01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:29.121
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1931
01:19:29.121 --> 01:19:30.130
<v Speaker 2>just like fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1932
01:19:30.131 --> 01:19:30.771
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1933
01:19:30.771 --> 01:19:32.570
<v Speaker 2>it just wouldn't be healthy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1934
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

1935
01:19:33.801 --> 01:19:34.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1936
01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:36.770
<v Speaker 2>like my mother will come home like </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a rough day and it's like,</v>

1937
01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:37.190
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>

1938
01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:37.721
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1939
01:19:37.721 --> 01:19:39.350
<v Speaker 2>it was a young person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1940
01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:40.243
<v Speaker 2>it's like fucking ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's in Massachusetts in like this </v>

1941
01:19:43.911 --> 01:19:44.810
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>

1942
01:19:44.811 --> 01:19:46.100
<v Speaker 2>centered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these windows.</v>

1943
01:19:46.101 --> 01:19:48.770
<v Speaker 2>And like the seasons are changing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1944
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:50.323
<v Speaker 2>I would love to make a movie about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a little too crazy and </v>

1945
01:19:52.341 --> 01:19:55.310
<v Speaker 2>heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This subject matters is very interesting</v>

1946
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:58.130
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's something that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be explored honestly.</v>

1947
01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.293
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if there's a way to make it </v>

1948
01:20:00.741 --> 01:20:04.430
<v Speaker 2>that isn't brutally depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1949
01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there is,</v>

1950
01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:09.420
<v Speaker 2>but could be beautifully depressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

1951
01:20:09.421 --> 01:20:12.540
<v Speaker 2>But like there's one story that she told</v>
<v Speaker 2>me this like incredible.</v>

1952
01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of her nurses aids,</v>

1953
01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:17.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of immigrants that,</v>

1954
01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.100
<v Speaker 2>that work there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she,</v>

1955
01:20:19.101 --> 01:20:19.934
<v Speaker 2>she was a Haitian immigrant and she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the room holding something in her </v>

1956
01:20:23.551 --> 01:20:24.570
<v Speaker 2>arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a towel.</v>

1957
01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.790
<v Speaker 2>And My mother was working with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1958
01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:32.610
<v Speaker 2>older gentleman who was very sick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of out of it.</v>

1959
01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:36.120
<v Speaker 2>And My mother was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1960
01:20:36.121 --> 01:20:40.320
<v Speaker 2>so she's going to take care of you now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the old guy said some racial slur,</v>

1961
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a black woman.</v>

1962
01:20:42.211 --> 01:20:43.044
<v Speaker 2>And it says like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that whatever touching me </v>

1963

<v Speaker 1>that is what I searched for it.</v>

2281
01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:21.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like the micro moments of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

2282
01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:22.083
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful micro moment and boom goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dynamite is so good because it's </v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean if he coined that then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what's so sad about is he's </v>

2287
01:33:39.670 --> 01:33:40.503
<v Speaker 1>flailing and then in the Lebanese it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the thing that he wanted to say </v>
