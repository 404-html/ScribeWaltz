<v Speaker 4>dear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great guy.</v>

128
00:06:58.021 --> 00:07:02.670
<v Speaker 4>He deserves it and it's insane to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>what he's accomplished since we met him.</v>

129
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.943
<v Speaker 4>I mean even just this year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we probably met him like two years ago </v>

130
00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:07.680
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like this year alone,</v>

131
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.920
<v Speaker 4>since his new album came out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was crazy.</v>

132
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's easy to forget what is.</v>

133
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.520
<v Speaker 4>He's 23 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

134
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.870
<v Speaker 4>That should make everybody at home </v>
<v Speaker 4>depressing.</v>

135
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.800
<v Speaker 4>That depresses the hell out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I was 23 years old.</v>

136
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.623
<v Speaker 4>I was probably playing world of warcraft</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it in a disgusting dormitory room </v>

137
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.480
<v Speaker 4>with like leftover Burrito's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was going nowhere fast.</v>

138
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.970
<v Speaker 4>Pretty incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a 23 year old can accomplish.</v>

139
00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:42.750
<v Speaker 4>So love and pride for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's watch his acceptance speech.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

185
00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:14.511
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>can just talk about something and show </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to you at the same time.</v>

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Cutting edge technology here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is such an experience.</v>

200
00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:52.454

205
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you frame it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it also comes in a nice box.</v>

206
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you keep it in the box or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take it out of the box.</v>

207
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:15.763
<v Speaker 2>I think you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean there's mounts for guitars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think kind of just like a wall piece.</v>

209
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you just hang it.</v>

210
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.590
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm calling you.</v>

211
00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:27.650
<v Speaker 2>His birthday isla was gone so I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda on my own by the way,</v>

212
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.830
<v Speaker 2>taking care of myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hard enough as it is.</v>

213
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.960
<v Speaker 2>And so I go to this gunshot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

214
00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:35.000
<v Speaker 2>what can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can I get posted?</v>

215
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.990
<v Speaker 2>So he had ordered this really cool glock</v>
<v Speaker 2>from them and I was like,</v>

216
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.570
<v Speaker 2>I want to get him something dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got him this little snipey cool ass</v>

217
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.040
<v Speaker 2>laser snipey they put on top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Glock,</v>

218
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the official name?</v>

219
00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Or are you just calling it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an APP.</v>

220
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:50.910
<v Speaker 2>It's called a snipey.</v>

221
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a scope.</v>

222
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.313
<v Speaker 2>It's a sick ass scope by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you only see it if you look </v>

223
00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:02.290
<v Speaker 2>through the snipey hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you got someone locked on,</v>

224
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 2>they don't see the laser right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the movies only you see it.</v>

225
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 2>It's an Ip then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

226
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 2>And I got him like a thousand rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was feeling pretty good.</v>

227
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.870
<v Speaker 2>I had like two ammo boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a snipey,</v>

228
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.500
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of rounds and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

229
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.260
<v Speaker 2>that's a thoughtful gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Personal.</v>

230
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:20.243
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty weird to show up into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>party where it was a big party and I </v>

231
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 2>felt a little bit strange showing up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Ammo at that gun store.</v>

232
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you sure this is okay?</v>

233
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.083
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually went in there to buy him a </v>

234
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 2>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

235
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to buy him a gun.</v>

236
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.610
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't like what?</v>

237
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.453
<v Speaker 2>What are you fucking stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't buy him a gun and bring it to </v>

238
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:40.570
<v Speaker 2>a party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

239
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that does make sense.</v>

240
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.753
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's probably a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the one thing you can do </v>

241
00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:47.290
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

242
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:48.310
<v Speaker 2>that's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

243
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 2>that's probably a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>

244
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:53.230
<v Speaker 2>On one hand I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here on the show being like gun control,</v>

245
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I buy a weapon?</v>

246
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 2>And then on the same day give it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else.</v>

247
00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.911
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

248
00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that makes sense.</v>

249
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought a bunch of Ammo,</v>

250
00:13:02.051 --> 00:13:04.690
<v Speaker 2>thousand rounds of snipey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably spent like $1,500.</v>

251
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.250
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

252
00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:08.941
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

253
00:13:08.941 --> 00:13:11.370
<v Speaker 2>I hooked up my dude up and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

254
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.780
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he comes and I was like,</v>

255
00:13:12.781 --> 00:13:13.501
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

256
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.030
<v Speaker 2>But I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was very gracious.</v>

257
00:13:15.031 --> 00:13:15.864
<v Speaker 2>Isn't about post at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is more a rant against 21 savage </v>

258
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.330
<v Speaker 2>because I have beef with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know it,</v>

259
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.630
<v Speaker 2>so I mean pulse was very gracious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very sweet as you know.</v>

260
00:13:24.631 --> 00:13:25.464
<v Speaker 2>He's a perfect angel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably the closest thing to a perfect </v>

261
00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:31.770
<v Speaker 2>human being and then savage shows up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gives him,</v>

262
00:13:31.771 --> 00:13:35.460
<v Speaker 2>I shit you not like five minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>

263
00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:36.294
<v Speaker 2>dollar watch.</v>

264
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

265
00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:42.024
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hip hop you gotta show my broke </v>

266
00:13:43.951 --> 00:13:47.460
<v Speaker 2>ass up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

267
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.960
<v Speaker 2>what kind of watch was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember?</v>

268
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.003
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like on the news and now </v>

269
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.193
<v Speaker 2>twitter news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's my snipey and the that was </v>

270
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.293
<v Speaker 2>newsworthy and now I see Austin walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around with his sick ass hundred </v>

271
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.063
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollar watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't see them walking around with this </v>

272
00:14:04.801 --> 00:14:09.801
<v Speaker 2>snipey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about how much the gift cost,</v>

273
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.573
<v Speaker 2>it's about the gesture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case it was most definitely </v>

274
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.850
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he loved to watch.</v>

275
00:14:17.851 --> 00:14:19.380
<v Speaker 2>He was a great watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a great gift.</v>

276
00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:20.214
<v Speaker 2>I just honestly wish maybe you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have waited and given it to him before </v>

277
00:14:24.841 --> 00:14:25.680
<v Speaker 2>the party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:14:25.681 --> 00:14:26.514
<v Speaker 2>like maybe a different time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was just kind of rude to me </v>

279
00:14:31.081 --> 00:14:35.280
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do take it as a kind of a problem.</v>

280
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.680
<v Speaker 2>So if you see savage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him know that we do have beef.</v>

281
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Don't let him know everyone's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

282
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

283
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.930
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>congratulations to post them.</v>

284
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.740

290
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 2>stuck in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wheels blew out when they take off,</v>

294
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.033
<v Speaker 2>So he's circling around doing an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about to do an emergency landing there </v>

295
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.560
<v Speaker 2>in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing circles,</v>

296
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:31.910
<v Speaker 2>trying to burn up fuel to reduce the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight so they can,</v>

297
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

332
00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:07.100
<v Speaker 2>interesting than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody emailed me.</v>

333
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

334
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.460
<v Speaker 2>over the past couple of days and email </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stood out to me and sort of</v>

335
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:14.000
<v Speaker 2>shocked me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said to me,</v>

336
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.163
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been listening a lot to your </v>

337
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:18.810
<v Speaker 2>conversation about wiping and anal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

338
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.180
<v Speaker 2>cleanliness and hygiene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he says,</v>

339
00:17:23.181 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do is I near my asshole.</v>

340
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:27.860
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

341
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.870
<v Speaker 2>there is a topical cream that you apply </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the hair and then you.</v>

342
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.420
<v Speaker 2>And then basically it burns it off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just wipe it clean.</v>

343
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.733
<v Speaker 2>So this guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use sensitive Nair on my asshole rink </v>

344
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 2>and I wiped the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

345
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.460
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so insane and hilarious.</v>

346
00:17:46.461 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I think I have to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you</v>

347
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:55.010
<v Speaker 8>shouldn't because this stuff is like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you could burn your skin.</v>

348
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 8>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't know what it was.</v>

349
00:17:57.211 --> 00:18:02.211
<v Speaker 8>I went on Amazon just to check the </v>
<v Speaker 8>reviews and like most of the reviews are</v>

350
00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:04.880
<v Speaker 8>pictures of people got burned,</v>
<v Speaker 8>seen assholes.</v>

351
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.023
<v Speaker 8>No</v>

352
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.373
<v Speaker 2>assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More resilient or less resilient really </v>

353
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:13.350
<v Speaker 2>because it touched his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they would have let him know.</v>

354
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.473
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of the charm is </v>

355
00:18:16.161 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

356
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.370
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the pursuit of knowledge.</v>

357
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:27.380
<v Speaker 2>This is like forbidden fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forbidden knowledge and Biblical and the</v>

358
00:18:27.381 --> 00:18:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Biblical on emission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more important.</v>

359
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a mission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is God's work.</v>

360
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Read the Messenger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you read the Bible,</v>

361
00:18:36.591 --> 00:18:40.760
<v Speaker 2>the story of Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the apple is the forbidden knowledge.</v>

362
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:41.843
<v Speaker 2>People don't always talk about how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wiped their ass and cleaned their ass </v>

363
00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:47.780
<v Speaker 2>and these important things that we need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to collectively share our knowledge.</v>

364
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:52.820
<v Speaker 2>So I think of myself as kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trailblazer of a kind of a,</v>

365
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.770
<v Speaker 2>a Magellan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christopher Columbus.</v>

366
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was someone who explored.</v>

367
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an explorer.</v>

368
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of a Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

369
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm a great thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said Isaac Newton,</v>

370
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Isaac Newton said of himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a giant.</v>

371
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I just stand on the shoulders of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>before me.</v>

372
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.830
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm.</v>

373
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.950
<v Speaker 2>How is that related?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm how to ask wiping giant.</v>

374
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.983
<v Speaker 2>I lent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stand on the shoulders of the wealth </v>

375
00:19:24.891 --> 00:19:26.930
<v Speaker 2>of knowledge with those who've come </v>
<v Speaker 2>before me.</v>

376
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has dared and the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mankind as far as I can tell,</v>

377
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.280
<v Speaker 2>to collect this knowledge and to share </v>
<v Speaker 2>it with the world.</v>

378
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.323
<v Speaker 2>This is important stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the pursuit of the forbidden </v>

379
00:19:40.041 --> 00:19:45.041
<v Speaker 2>fruit and the biblical tale of Adam and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eve there is much the same.</v>

380
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.180
<v Speaker 2>And so I will near my asshole</v>

381
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:48.623
<v Speaker 8>and he burned.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Narrow is like a something you put </v>

382
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.660
<v Speaker 8>inside your asphalt really when you </v>
<v Speaker 8>like.</v>

383
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:56.763
<v Speaker 8>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's say you need to take a pill but </v>

384
00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.813
<v Speaker 8>throw your right.</v>

385
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like medicine or would you call a </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppository?</v>

386
00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.360
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So that's what that's called.</v>

387
00:20:07.361 --> 00:20:08.290
<v Speaker 8>And they're.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

388
00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:10.570
<v Speaker 8>that's this show.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The first time you said that to me,</v>

389
00:20:10.571 --> 00:20:12.900
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what do you mean [inaudible]?</v>

390
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:13.873
<v Speaker 8>You're good.</v>

391
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.160
<v Speaker 2>That's almost a sign from God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

392
00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.730
<v Speaker 2>he grows God's language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

393
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.100
<v Speaker 2>So narrow in a way was almost a destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The destiny will use of nir was.</v>

394
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.750
<v Speaker 2>So you kind of supporting my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my um.</v>

395
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Well I think for think this week I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

396
00:20:32.971 --> 00:20:36.840
<v Speaker 2>my asshole for better or worse if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>burns,</v>

397
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 2>if it cures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

398
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.473
<v Speaker 2>I have never had a wipe in recent memory</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't Harry and I think that this </v>

399
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:50.560
<v Speaker 2>could be it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has the metamucil been helping you?</v>

400
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a cure all,</v>

401
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:56.020
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people and asking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>updates on the metamucil,</v>

402
00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.073
<v Speaker 2>this fiber supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been taking it too because </v>

403
00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:00.780
<v Speaker 2>it's also just fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which should be good.</v>

404
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.440
<v Speaker 2>But like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't notice any difference in.</v>

405
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the first time I took it,</v>

406
00:21:07.321 --> 00:21:11.500

<v Speaker 2>I just slid right out.</v>

407
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:12.890

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

408

<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

494
00:25:41.571 --> 00:25:44.210
<v Speaker 4>podcast experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever that means.</v>

495
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.163
<v Speaker 4>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little flustered because I'm just </v>

496
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.413
<v Speaker 4>not used to this three minute breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just ran back from the bathroom and </v>

497
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:51.890
<v Speaker 4>literally Dan was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurry up,</v>

498
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 4>like jumped into the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally four seconds.</v>

499
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:56.720
<v Speaker 4>He's got my paper towel.</v>

500
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.740
<v Speaker 4>So as promised guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got a thrill ride here,</v>

501
00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:06.770
<v Speaker 4>lined up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This video shocked me.</v>

502
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.210
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've been educated.</v>

503
00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:09.044
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't before this video shocked me </v>

504
00:26:10.971 --> 00:26:13.940
<v Speaker 4>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like no video I've seen in a long time.</v>

505
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.553
<v Speaker 4>And the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the scoop originally was that it was </v>

506
00:26:18.051 --> 00:26:22.160
<v Speaker 4>fully monetized for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I get,</v>

507
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.080
<v Speaker 4>I guess you can only blame you for so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

508
00:26:24.081 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 4>It's called do vegans actually taste </v>
<v Speaker 4>better?</v>

509
00:26:25.941 --> 00:26:26.774
<v Speaker 4>So it's like how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does youtube know that a dude is </v>

510
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.673
<v Speaker 4>guzzling his own Jizz on camera?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The part that really gets me about this </v>

511
00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:39.611
<v Speaker 4>video by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gay God damn measurement called</v>

512
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Jugaad whose name I kind of liked that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jugaad.</v>

513
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:50.703
<v Speaker 2>So the thing that really gets me is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a key Jesus and like a little kind </v>

514
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:58.240
<v Speaker 2>of medicine cup and then he tastes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he's like,</v>

515
00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.313
<v Speaker 2>he loves it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he drinks it three more times </v>

516
00:27:02.051 --> 00:27:02.884
<v Speaker 2>and he finishes the Cup and I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually getting nauseous as I did that </v>

517
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:11.120
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this video is clearly per.</v>

518
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.900
<v Speaker 2>So you definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to drink,</v>

519
00:27:13.901 --> 00:27:16.960
<v Speaker 2>you have kids on camera like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're definitely the gay God.</v>

520
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Not many people can step to you on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

521
00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.440
<v Speaker 9>Autumn of this.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Do you begin to actually taste better?</v>

522
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.890
<v Speaker 9>And I have actually been Vegan for 12 </v>
<v Speaker 9>years,</v>

523
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.903
<v Speaker 9>over 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So who better to test this theory that </v>

524
00:27:30.641 --> 00:27:33.100
<v Speaker 9>me,</v>
<v Speaker 9>myself,</v>

525
00:27:33.101 --> 00:27:35.800
<v Speaker 9>and I haven't really tasted myself in </v>
<v Speaker 9>quite a while.</v>

526
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:40.240
<v Speaker 8>What the fuck is wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is this nothing weird?</v>

527
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.140
<v Speaker 8>Like you're supposed to know what he's </v>
<v Speaker 8>talking about.</v>

528
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:47.420
<v Speaker 8>He's drank his own tj's nobody didn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>say that yet.</v>

529
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.220
<v Speaker 8>It's just saying I haven't tasted myself</v>
<v Speaker 8>in a while.</v>

530
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.680
<v Speaker 8>Like you're supposed to know what that </v>
<v Speaker 8>means.</v>

531
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.600
<v Speaker 8>People watching readily gay God know </v>
<v Speaker 8>what that means.</v>

532
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:59.190
<v Speaker 8>I'm subscribed to [inaudible] channel </v>
<v Speaker 8>serious on his channel.</v>

533
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.750
<v Speaker 2>But like how frequently are you drinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own con?</v>

534
00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:06.363
<v Speaker 7>Huh?</v>

535
00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.953
<v Speaker 2>But how is this not like a weird fetish </v>
<v Speaker 2>like drinking or common front of people </v>

536
00:28:11.741 --> 00:28:14.110
<v Speaker 2>publicly is kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably is.</v>

537
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:15.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

538
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.213
<v Speaker 9>So I might have went ahead and shot a </v>
<v Speaker 9>little bit of myself into this shot </v>

539
00:28:20.661 --> 00:28:21.494
<v Speaker 9>glass and I kind of want to be open and </v>
<v Speaker 9>honest with you guys and tell you what </v>

540
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:27.860
<v Speaker 9>they actually tastes like.</v>

541
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Suggested my first time experiencing 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>inches.</v>

542
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.670
<v Speaker 2>That's what it says in the top right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is certainly the gay God might do,</v>

543
00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.610
<v Speaker 2>but like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand.</v>

544
00:28:40.611 --> 00:28:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be gay.</v>

545
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Like obviously no one cares that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay in this day and age,</v>

546
00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.653
<v Speaker 2>but like when your whole identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you do and talk about and is </v>

547
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.613
<v Speaker 2>like a bow like that you're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's gotta be more to you </v>

548
00:28:55.341 --> 00:28:57.260
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's about like,</v>

549
00:28:57.261 --> 00:28:59.190
<v Speaker 2>I drink matches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a 10 inch cock.</v>

550
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's gotta be more to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that</v>

551
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.480
<v Speaker 8>tube game that everyone's trying to play</v>
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>

552
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:10.550
<v Speaker 8>And like everything's got to be so crazy</v>
<v Speaker 8>like we used to.</v>

553
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:11.743

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.343
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't been following the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then here you can see by year at </v>

705
00:36:43.991 --> 00:36:48.991
<v Speaker 2>chart basically since 2016 and to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>date it's shot up.</v>

706
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.233
<v Speaker 2>These are all synthetic opioids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically pain prescribed prescription </v>

707
00:37:01.081 --> 00:37:06.081
<v Speaker 2>painkillers way worse than heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

708
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.193
<v Speaker 2>like almost double that that if you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting if you go back to like </v>

709
00:37:09.391 --> 00:37:11.370
<v Speaker 2>2012,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2013,</v>

710
00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:18.180
<v Speaker 2>it was the least deadly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although what's going on in the US,</v>

711
00:37:18.181 --> 00:37:21.750
<v Speaker 2>if you go back to 1999,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people weren't really dying from drugs</v>

712
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:27.020
<v Speaker 2>but somehow unliked and turn the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this century.</v>

713
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are profiting from it and heroin,</v>

714
00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:35.360
<v Speaker 2>cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like all going up.</v>

715
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:38.990
<v Speaker 2>Is this a cultural issue or is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

716
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.470
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say the,</v>

717
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.460
<v Speaker 2>the whole graph going up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a cultural issue,</v>

718
00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:47.300
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one spike on the synthetic opioids,</v>

719
00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Not.</v>

720
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.053
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am very curious about the cultural </v>

721
00:37:51.681 --> 00:37:52.514
<v Speaker 2>issue of why in the past 2015 or 15 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years or is everybody dying from </v>

722
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.270
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

723
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if there's some explanation or </v>
<v Speaker 2>visit.</v>

724
00:38:04.071 --> 00:38:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Just life has become so unbearable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

725
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:12.470
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take away health care,</v>

726
00:38:12.471 --> 00:38:13.304
<v Speaker 2>let's put everyone in that and let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just give them some opiates to fucking </v>

727
00:38:16.491 --> 00:38:20.850
<v Speaker 2>kill themselves on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's become a lot hard.</v>

728
00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:22.540
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life's become a lot harder.</v>

729
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:23.403
<v Speaker 2>If you go back to 1999,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people could buy houses that could </v>

730
00:38:26.171 --> 00:38:31.171
<v Speaker 2>afford rent and over these past two </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades it's gotten a lot harder to live</v>

731
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 2>a lot more expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blow harder to get medical treatment.</v>

732
00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's a relation by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty sad.</v>

733
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.263
<v Speaker 2>There's a bigger conversation here </v>
<v Speaker 2>besides affect everyone's dying on </v>

734
00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:50.150
<v Speaker 2>opioids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is the story here now.</v>

735
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:54.350
<v Speaker 2>I've been watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just find it so ironic,</v>

736
00:38:54.351 --> 00:38:55.184
<v Speaker 2>like let me open this again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there's this war on drugs like </v>

737
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.880
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

738
00:38:58.881 --> 00:38:59.714
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a marijuana user and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's benefits and is greatly </v>

739
00:39:03.261 --> 00:39:04.094
<v Speaker 2>exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think marijuana is an innocent </v>

740
00:39:05.001 --> 00:39:05.834
<v Speaker 2>truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do find it absolutely the </v>

741
00:39:08.331 --> 00:39:09.164
<v Speaker 2>greatest,</v>

742
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.433
<v Speaker 2>probably the single greatest problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>with our society is the fact that one </v>

743
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:19.300
<v Speaker 2>percent of Americans are in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them for harmless drug offense.</v>

744
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's like we're locking up marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>users</v>

745
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:25.780
<v Speaker 7>and meanwhile</v>

746
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:31.820
<v Speaker 2>doctors and pharmaceutical companies are</v>
<v Speaker 2>openly poisoning people and I mean we're</v>

747
00:39:33.001 --> 00:39:34.770
<v Speaker 2>talking about 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>deaths.</v>

748
00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.890
<v Speaker 2>That's a small subset of people who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>addicted,</v>

749
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:38.873
<v Speaker 2>whose lives are being ruined because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're taking so many of these opiates </v>

750
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.223
<v Speaker 2>and doctors are just giving them out </v>
<v Speaker 2>like fucking candy because they're </v>

751
00:39:46.141 --> 00:39:51.000
<v Speaker 2>getting kickbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like three big companies who are</v>

752
00:39:51.001 --> 00:39:51.834
<v Speaker 2>distributed all this and they know </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what they were doing and oh </v>

753
00:39:55.561 --> 00:39:57.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just what it is.</v>

754
00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.090
<v Speaker 2>We saw the 60 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

755
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.733
<v Speaker 2>report about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how there was like little pain clinics </v>

756
00:40:07.261 --> 00:40:08.910
<v Speaker 2>opening up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when we seen them.</v>

757
00:40:08.911 --> 00:40:10.020
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

758
00:40:10.021 --> 00:40:10.854
<v Speaker 2>what is that pain clinic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And apparently you can just walk in and </v>

759
00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:18.100
<v Speaker 2>a doctor will prescribe you a painkiller</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also predictive.</v>

760
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Don't give you anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll give you oxycontin.</v>

761
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:22.560
<v Speaker 2>They'll be any opiate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any crazy shit you want.</v>

762
00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:23.423
<v Speaker 2>Just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey my,</v>

763
00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.323
<v Speaker 2>hey doc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my back hurts and these crooked ass </v>

764
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.633
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just writing prescriptions all </v>

765
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.710
<v Speaker 2>day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad,</v>

766
00:40:28.711 --> 00:40:29.544
<v Speaker 2>he um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had like some arthritic pain in his </v>

767
00:40:32.311 --> 00:40:33.144
<v Speaker 2>wrist and this doctor gave him like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unlimited supply of like really intense </v>

768
00:40:40.201 --> 00:40:42.150
<v Speaker 2>painkillers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

769
00:40:42.151 --> 00:40:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if he actually took kids so easy.</v>

770
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.820
<v Speaker 2>And I mean this is an ongoing issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a,</v>

771
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not like doesn't abilitative his </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

772
00:40:53.161 --> 00:40:54.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't.</v>

773
00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Nothing in my opinion that a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>tylenol or Ibuprofen couldn't resolve.</v>

774
00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.940
<v Speaker 7>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's insane.</v>

775
00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:10.250
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy what's going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And anyway,</v>

776
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.330
<v Speaker 2>in the 60 minutes report that I hired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would come in.</v>

777
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.533
<v Speaker 2>They were showing how these huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical companies are basically </v>

778
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:17.423
<v Speaker 2>con always lobbying congress to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforce or regulate or control at all </v>

779
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.500
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this growing issue.</v>

780
00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:26.603
<v Speaker 2>They showed like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was one town like this is </v>

781
00:41:28.801 --> 00:41:31.680
<v Speaker 2>really ravaging like poor white </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities.</v>

782
00:41:31.681 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 2>It seems like in rural America,</v>

783
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.520
<v Speaker 4>like Arkansas and Alabama and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mississippi,</v>

784
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.533
<v Speaker 4>there was like a small town in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mississippi or somewhere that had </v>

785
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:43.124
<v Speaker 4>imported so many and sold so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>painkillers that it was something like </v>

786
00:41:49.921 --> 00:41:53.430
<v Speaker 4>50 pills for every resident of the city.</v>

787
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.433
<v Speaker 11>Hm.</v>

788
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:59.650
<v Speaker 4>Which means that they were probably just</v>
<v Speaker 4>selling it to drug dealers,</v>

789
00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:05.140
<v Speaker 4>but like there's glaring problems here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have everyone dropped it like this,</v>

790
00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.860
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is so sick and,</v>

791
00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:08.723
<v Speaker 4>and the government's not doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it because there's so much a </v>

792
00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:15.761
<v Speaker 4>lobbying money and meanwhile we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>lucking up marijuana users.</v>

793
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:21.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's pretty nuts.</v>

794
00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.470
<v Speaker 4>That really grinds my gears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

795
00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:33.870
<v Speaker 4>I just hate this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like moral.</v>

796
00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:36.490
<v Speaker 4>There's always this moral argument from </v>
<v Speaker 4>like army.</v>

797
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:37.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeff sessions,</v>

798
00:42:37.531 --> 00:42:38.364
<v Speaker 4>the attorney general thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana should be like a federal </v>

799
00:42:41.461 --> 00:42:42.294
<v Speaker 4>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's staunchly against legalizing </v>

800
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:45.720
<v Speaker 4>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

801
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.760
<v Speaker 4>okay dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing about this shit?</v>

802
00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:54.520
<v Speaker 4>Like glad that you got your moral </v>
<v Speaker 4>imperative about marijuana and,</v>

803
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.393
<v Speaker 4>and relatively harmless drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing about this shit so </v>

804
00:43:02.481 --> 00:43:06.110
<v Speaker 4>twisted man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking can you believe that?</v>

805
00:43:06.111 --> 00:43:06.944
<v Speaker 4>It's like Tiawana up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've driven past few places when I'm </v>

806
00:43:08.841 --> 00:43:12.020
<v Speaker 4>driving around town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see like a pain clinic.</v>

807
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:13.040
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean,</v>

808
00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:15.080
<v Speaker 4>a pain clinic?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>

809
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:15.943
<v Speaker 4>what do you do there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never imagined that it was actually </v>

810
00:43:17.931 --> 00:43:20.420
<v Speaker 4>just people giving prescription drugs </v>
<v Speaker 4>out like nothing.</v>

811
00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.333
<v Speaker 8>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I'm just writing what you were </v>

812
00:43:23.971 --> 00:43:26.220
<v Speaker 8>talking about and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

813
00:43:26.221 --> 00:43:27.054
<v Speaker 8>And like all of a sudden there is a </v>
<v Speaker 8>small town and the pharmacy will be </v>

814
00:43:29.701 --> 00:43:34.410
<v Speaker 8>buying 50 times the amount that a normal</v>
<v Speaker 8>pharmacy right is buying.</v>

815
00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:35.483
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it's like they're just turning a </v>

816
00:43:37.621 --> 00:43:40.350
<v Speaker 8>blind eye,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just letting it happen</v>

817
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.100
<v Speaker 4>because the pharmaceutical drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies that are lobbying the shit out</v>

818
00:43:43.101 --> 00:43:47.720
<v Speaker 4>of him and blocking it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like congress is so twisted.</v>

819
00:43:47.721 --> 00:43:50.570
<v Speaker 4>These guys are so fucking corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like scary.</v>

820
00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.000
<v Speaker 4>Not to mention the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the water is turning frogs gay.</v>

821
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.050
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole nother issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>story Ilah or did we find it too little,</v>

823
00:44:03.521 --> 00:44:04.354
<v Speaker 4>too sad</v>

824

<v Speaker 4>Dan?</v>

828
00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:16.383
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

829
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.370
<v Speaker 4>the edit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a shared with you,</v>

830
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:20.343
<v Speaker 4>shared with me where here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll drop it in the inner chat right </v>

831
00:44:23.291 --> 00:44:25.230
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

832
00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.150
<v Speaker 4>this story isn't weird and wild man and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind</v>

833
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>of sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very sad.</v>

834
00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure how he even got in the car,</v>

835
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:43.740
<v Speaker 2>works in airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how is it so easy to just,</v>

836
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:46.950
<v Speaker 2>there's no key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think he masterminded this.</v>

837
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

838
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.463
<v Speaker 2>Figuring out if this guy works at an </v>
<v Speaker 2>airplane in Seattle and he just stole </v>

839
00:44:56.011 --> 00:45:00.360
<v Speaker 2>the airplane and went for a joy ride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his intention was,</v>

840
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.253
<v Speaker 2>was to commit suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's so intriguing about it is </v>

841
00:45:03.571 --> 00:45:04.404
<v Speaker 2>basically this conversation was recorded</v>
<v Speaker 2>between him and air control of air </v>

842
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:12.601
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being like,</v>

843
00:45:12.601 --> 00:45:13.440
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

844
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.700
<v Speaker 2>bring it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it down.</v>

845
00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:20.800
<v Speaker 2>And he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just so casual about it.</v>

846
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.630
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like he's having a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

847
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

848
00:45:25.511 --> 00:45:30.511
<v Speaker 2>I don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just drop the Lincoln,</v>

849
00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.000
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't work.</v>

850
00:45:35.001 --> 00:45:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I clicked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I need it.</v>

851
00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:39.570
<v Speaker 2>But here I've got it in your email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>

852
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:40.783

853
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:46.643
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

854
00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Twenty one year old.</v>

855
00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:53.320
<v Speaker 12>Hold on with me for a second.</v>

856
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.040
<v Speaker 2>So interesting</v>

857
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:12.670
<v Speaker 12>plane around.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You seem comfortable with that.</v>

858
00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:23.923
<v Speaker 2>What's so crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this what you guys are seeing as all </v>

859
00:46:25.491 --> 00:46:30.110
<v Speaker 2>footage people shop from the ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this guy was like,</v>

860
00:46:30.111 --> 00:46:30.944
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try doing barrel rolls and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these tricks because his intention </v>

861
00:46:33.111 --> 00:46:34.860
<v Speaker 2>was to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was almost just like.</v>

862
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:38.500
<v Speaker 2>But he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was performing some pretty amazing so</v>

863
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.140
<v Speaker 2>being like don't want to hurt people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the street.</v>

864
00:46:42.141 --> 00:46:44.730
<v Speaker 2>So he was also careful of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

865
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

866
00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:49.730
<v Speaker 2>he definitely wasn't going to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone</v>

867
00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.653
<v Speaker 12>and you can see all the terrain around </v>
<v Speaker 12>and you've got no issue with visibility </v>

868
00:46:57.141 --> 00:46:57.974
<v Speaker 12>or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I got some gas to go check out the </v>

869

<v Speaker 12>I mean I would hope it is for a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 12>me.</v>

875

<v Speaker 12>We're not going to worry or think about </v>
<v Speaker 12>that,</v>

876
00:47:52.261 --> 00:47:55.620
<v Speaker 12>but could you start?</v>
<v Speaker 12>I believe so.</v>

<v Speaker 12>I'm still working on an issue average.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Don't say stuff like that.</v>

<v Speaker 12>see if we can land there because I don't</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm a lefty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's be frank.</v>

953
00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:55.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not that now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you go dry or wet?</v>

954
00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.580
<v Speaker 2>I guess I go try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

955
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I feel kind of ashamed and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of ashamed of.</v>

956
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:07.880
<v Speaker 2>We shamed normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which try a white ball now.</v>

957
00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:08.714
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ever feel that you just can't </v>

958
00:53:11.871 --> 00:53:13.450
<v Speaker 2>clean it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

959
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you give up or do you wipe to the</v>

960
00:53:16.311 --> 00:53:17.144
<v Speaker 2>point where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because usually with dry wiping your </v>

961
00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:20.143
<v Speaker 2>ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come to a crossroad where you're </v>

962
00:53:20.781 --> 00:53:21.614
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give up too early or do I injure my </v>

963
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.530
<v Speaker 2>anus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where do you,</v>

964
00:53:24.531 --> 00:53:26.490
<v Speaker 2>where do you fall in that crossroad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

965
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

966
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.851
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

967
00:53:27.851 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 2>I've been there and it definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a risky road.</v>

968
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:32.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

969
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>

970
00:53:33.891 --> 00:53:34.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got hair.</v>

971
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

972
00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.410
<v Speaker 2>it gets rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets real rough.</v>

973
00:53:37.411 --> 00:53:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you take the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under wiping or the overwhelming,</v>

974
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:42.333
<v Speaker 2>I got to say I probably do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming because that's the other </v>

975
00:53:45.661 --> 00:53:46.740
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not okay.</v>

976
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:49.080
<v Speaker 2>That's not tolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not really an option.</v>

977
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Not for me either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

978
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Have you bled from wiping?</v>

979
00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 2>It may be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I probably don't check enough.</v>

980
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:58.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

981
00:53:58.581 --> 00:54:01.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't turn around and check out my </v>
<v Speaker 2>business after.</v>

982
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not ashamed to admit that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've bled from wiping.</v>

983
00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to say what's going on here?</v>

984
00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:10.650
<v Speaker 2>I've got to grab their password.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We this.</v>

987
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Have you bled from wiping?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said you now,</v>

988
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:22.763
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say May.</v>

989
00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:23.853

990
00:54:26.131 --> 00:54:28.640
<v Speaker 2>answer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

991
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't turn around and check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you not look?</v>

992
00:54:30.301 --> 00:54:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Every time you wipe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you look at what point do you look?</v>

993
00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally you don't look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't look at the last wipe.</v>

994
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.660
<v Speaker 2>How do you know your claim?</v>

<v Speaker 14>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 14>so I'm a geocasher or if you don't know </v>

1023

<v Speaker 14>what Geo caching is,</v>
<v Speaker 14>say a little like cps based treasure </v>

1024
00:56:15.291 --> 00:56:16.124
<v Speaker 14>hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 14>a scavenger hunt type game and a lot of </v>

1025
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.500
<v Speaker 14>caching takes place out in the woods on </v>
<v Speaker 14>trails and whatnot.</v>

1026
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:24.820
<v Speaker 14>So before I started this,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I was never a,</v>

1027
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:27.310
<v Speaker 14>never a hiker,</v>
<v Speaker 14>never spent much time outdoors.</v>

1028
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:32.170
<v Speaker 14>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 14>so I quickly learned that,</v>

1029
00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:33.293
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you're on a trail for awhile sometime </v>

1030
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.900
<v Speaker 14>nature calls and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>let me literally,</v>

1031
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:40.130
<v Speaker 14>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

1032
00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:42.400
<v Speaker 14>if you're like a couple miles from your </v>
<v Speaker 14>car or something,</v>

1033
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 14>a couple miles from a restroom,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you just got to find a spot to take care</v>

1034
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:47.540
<v Speaker 14>of business.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Um,</v>

1035
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:49.363
<v Speaker 14>so,</v>
<v Speaker 14>so you had the first time that's </v>

1036
00:56:51.551 --> 00:56:52.090
<v Speaker 14>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I'm a,</v>

1037
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:53.340
<v Speaker 14>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I'm a hairy guy,</v>

1038
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:55.080
<v Speaker 14>much like you.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Um,</v>

1039
00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:56.680
<v Speaker 14>so,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

1040
00:56:56.681 --> 00:56:57.514
<v Speaker 14>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's not,</v>

1041
00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:59.860
<v Speaker 14>it's never good.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Never comes out clean.</v>

1042
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:03.190
<v Speaker 14>So the first time this happened I,</v>
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>

1043
00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:05.110
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you always hear this and I,</v>

1044
00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 14>I always thought it was Kinda like a </v>
<v Speaker 14>joke,</v>

1045
00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:09.100
<v Speaker 14>but I don't know if you always hear </v>
<v Speaker 14>this,</v>

1046
00:57:09.101 --> 00:57:09.934
<v Speaker 14>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I use the least to kind of clean up the </v>

1047
00:57:12.371 --> 00:57:17.371
<v Speaker 14>business factor.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And a is not preferable,</v>

1048
00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:20.890
<v Speaker 14>but I quickly learned because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 14>as far as my normal wiping routine goes,</v>

1049
00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:24.080
<v Speaker 14>I'm a dry wet guy,</v>
<v Speaker 14>so I'll go my first one,</v>

1050
00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:25.053
<v Speaker 14>first one will be a toilet paper and </v>
<v Speaker 14>then I got the baby was right by the </v>

1051
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:28.744
<v Speaker 14>toilet that second.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And then I just kind of go back and </v>

1052
00:57:31.361 --> 00:57:32.110
<v Speaker 14>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 14>You kind of,</v>

1053
00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:32.943
<v Speaker 14>it's a good way to kind of feel out the </v>
<v Speaker 14>situation without having to inspect it </v>

1054
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:39.320
<v Speaker 14>after every white because I,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

1055
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.200
<v Speaker 1>so let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's go to the,</v>

1056
00:57:43.201 --> 00:57:44.930
<v Speaker 1>the pivotal moment of the story.</v>

1057
00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:47.053
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So,</v>

1058
00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:48.483
<v Speaker 14>um,</v>
<v Speaker 14>this wasn't so on another occasion </v>

1059
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:53.030
<v Speaker 14>because I started packing toilet paper </v>
<v Speaker 14>in my,</v>

1060
00:57:53.031 --> 00:57:53.864
<v Speaker 14>like hiking backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 14>But on this one particular occasion I </v>

1061
00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:01.400
<v Speaker 14>had run out where I forgot it.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So I do not have it with me.</v>

1062
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:03.640
<v Speaker 14>So,</v>
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>

1063
00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.120
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I live up in Rhode Island,</v>

1064
00:58:05.121 --> 00:58:08.210
<v Speaker 14>we ticks,</v>
<v Speaker 14>ticks are very prevalent thing up here.</v>

1065
00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.370
<v Speaker 14>And when did these as well.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So,</v>

1066
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:15.760
<v Speaker 14>um,</v>
<v Speaker 14>so I've never had an issue with ticks on</v>

1067
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:16.603
<v Speaker 14>my life,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but on this particular occasion when I </v>

1068
00:58:18.171 --> 00:58:20.000
<v Speaker 14>popped the squat,</v>
<v Speaker 14>did my business,</v>

1069
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:24.400
<v Speaker 14>didn't have the toilet paper.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So I just did the leaf technique to uh,</v>

1070
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:26.083
<v Speaker 14>do uh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

1071
00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:27.610
<v Speaker 14>kind of take care of things a bit.</v>

1072
00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get a tick on your penis?</v>

1073
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Not In my anus,</v>

1074
00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:38.070
<v Speaker 14>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like two days later I felt something.</v>

1075
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:42.813
<v Speaker 14>I think actually I felt something in my </v>
<v Speaker 14>groin area to say that I don't want to </v>

1076
00:58:47.671 --> 00:58:48.830
<v Speaker 14>talk about what I was doing.</v>

1077
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:54.030
<v Speaker 1>What were you doing when you noticed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick when you were jerking off?</v>

1078
00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:57.290
<v Speaker 14>You said that</v>

1079
00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:58.123
<v Speaker 1>Kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle,</v>

1080
00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:04.510
<v Speaker 1>were you able to send it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you finish when you,</v>

1081
00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:06.173
<v Speaker 1>when you found the tech error or did you</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide to deal with it at the time or </v>

1082
00:59:08.821 --> 00:59:11.280
<v Speaker 1>later?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1083
00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:13.350
<v Speaker 1>that ruined the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in bed.</v>

1085
00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Where on your groin was the tick </v>
<v Speaker 1>located?</v>

1086
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 14>It was like right</v>

1087
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.930
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a big dude so,</v>

1088
00:59:23.931 --> 00:59:24.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I got some,</v>

1089
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:26.980
<v Speaker 1>I got thick thighs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1090
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:29.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't,</v>

1091
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:30.703
<v Speaker 1>that's why I probably missed it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I always do like a check after it was </v>

1092
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.990
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1093
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:39.200
<v Speaker 1>like between the time it was deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1094
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:40.140
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1095
00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:43.080
<v Speaker 1>it was in there and it felt like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say deeper,</v>

1096
00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:46.670
<v Speaker 1>was it under the balls?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it between the balls and the thigh?</v>

1097
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Was it next to the peanut?</v>

1098
00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.320
<v Speaker 14>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 14>yeah,</v>

1099
00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.470
<v Speaker 14>in the ball between the ball thigh area </v>
<v Speaker 14>right over there.</v>

1100
00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.500
<v Speaker 1>That's how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I felt.</v>

1101
00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.770
<v Speaker 1>I felt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt that area.</v>

1102
00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:01.080
<v Speaker 1>You might have been cutting your balls </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something when you were jerking off.</v>

1103
01:00:01.081 --> 01:00:01.914
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To feel that there is something special </v>

1104
01:00:07.621 --> 01:00:12.621
<v Speaker 1>for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta treat yourself.</v>

1105
01:00:13.171 --> 01:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1106
01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.133
<v Speaker 1>Most definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when you have a take </v>

1107
01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:20.373
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

1108
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>

1109
01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:22.091
<v Speaker 14>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 14>yeah,</v>

1110
01:00:22.091 --> 01:00:22.970
<v Speaker 14>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

1111
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:25.240
<v Speaker 14>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

1112
01:00:25.241 --> 01:00:28.360
<v Speaker 14>you spend time hiking and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 14>especially around here,</v>

1113
01:00:28.361 --> 01:00:29.530
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you always hear about it.</v>

1114
01:00:29.531 --> 01:00:31.420
<v Speaker 14>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I was freaking out,</v>

1115
01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:33.370
<v Speaker 14>first of all because I never had a tick </v>
<v Speaker 14>bite before,</v>

1116
01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.533
<v Speaker 14>so I already knew the,</v>
<v Speaker 14>the way you want to get rid of it when </v>

1117
01:00:36.721 --> 01:00:37.554
<v Speaker 14>you want it,</v>
<v Speaker 14>when.</v>

1118
01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:39.220
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So when you take it out,</v>

1119
01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:40.563
<v Speaker 14>you don't want to like break the ticks </v>
<v Speaker 14>body or leave that was in like </v>

1120
01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.450
<v Speaker 14>underneath,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like it's burrowed in the skin,</v>

1121
01:00:46.451 --> 01:00:48.060
<v Speaker 14>like some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So did you,</v>

1122
01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.000
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>the techniques?</v>

1123
01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.090
<v Speaker 14>I use tweezers,</v>
<v Speaker 14>pull it out and it,</v>

1124
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>you grab it and then you rotate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1125
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.950
<v Speaker 14>right,</v>
<v Speaker 14>right.</v>

1126
01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:01.190
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And it was tricky and hard to see.</v>

1127
01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.750
<v Speaker 14>I mean I started.</v>

1128
01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:04.143
<v Speaker 1>Do you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you trim your pubic hair or are you </v>

1129
01:01:05.741 --> 01:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>fully a bushed?</v>

1130
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:09.860
<v Speaker 14>It depends when</v>

1131
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:11.710
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1132
01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:12.460
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1133
01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.293
<v Speaker 14>when it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it was probably some Bush happening at </v>

1134
01:01:15.041 --> 01:01:15.250
<v Speaker 14>that time.</v>

1135
01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the visibility was low.</v>

1136
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of bushwhacking going on.</v>

1137
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.983
<v Speaker 1>And so this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this son of a bitch gave you lyme </v>

1138
01:01:25.601 --> 01:01:26.434
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

1139
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.520
<v Speaker 14>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I started,</v>

1140
01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:31.610
<v Speaker 14>wound really shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 14>horrible.</v>

1141
01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:34.730
<v Speaker 14>And now it's like why am,</v>
<v Speaker 14>is a terrible thing?</v>

1142
01:01:34.731 --> 01:01:36.620
<v Speaker 14>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I don't have it as bad as some people,</v>

1143
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.963
<v Speaker 14>but it's kind of just with me now,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like every year this happened about </v>

1144
01:01:41.841 --> 01:01:43.310
<v Speaker 14>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 14>two years ago maybe.</v>

1145
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:45.140
<v Speaker 14>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 14>yeah,</v>

1146
01:01:45.141 --> 01:01:47.560
<v Speaker 14>so like once every,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

1147
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.510
<v Speaker 14>once or twice a year now,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like I was,</v>

1148
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.353
<v Speaker 14>had like really bad migraine,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like body aches just kind of shuts me </v>

1149
01:01:54.531 --> 01:01:56.810
<v Speaker 14>down for like a day.</v>
<v Speaker 14>It's just like with me,</v>

1150
01:01:56.811 --> 01:01:58.510
<v Speaker 14>even though I went on antibiotics and </v>
<v Speaker 14>whatnot,</v>

1151
01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.860
<v Speaker 14>it's just something that sometimes it </v>
<v Speaker 14>gets rid of it completely.</v>

1152
01:02:00.861 --> 01:02:01.810
<v Speaker 14>Sometimes it just lingers.</v>

1153
01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>So what is the kind of moral of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story?</v>

1154
01:02:04.651 --> 01:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1155
01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>don't go out in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moral,</v>

1156
01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.080
<v Speaker 1>the moral of the story is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what,</v>

1157
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>

1158
01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>what are we getting out of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle?</v>

1159
01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going down a different path that I</v>

1160
01:02:20.731 --> 01:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>was fucking Ian and then somehow we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this story.</v>

1161
01:02:22.831 --> 01:02:24.790
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you.</v>

1162
01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm sorry you got lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awful.</v>

1163
01:02:27.421 --> 01:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>But on the plus side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the masturbating probably was,</v>

1164
01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:36.590
<v Speaker 1>was definitely worked in your favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this time would have stayed longer,</v>

1165
01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I would have been even worse off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really.</v>

1166
01:02:38.431 --> 01:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>So is that the longer that ticks in you </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst?</v>

1167
01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:41.844
<v Speaker 1>The lyme disease?</v>

1168
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:43.783
<v Speaker 14>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 14>because I hadn't quite another time </v>

1169
01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:47.840
<v Speaker 14>like,</v>
<v Speaker 14>and um,</v>

1170
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:49.303
<v Speaker 14>I noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I know for a fact I noticed it within </v>

1171
01:02:50.721 --> 01:02:51.800
<v Speaker 14>like,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

1172
01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:52.634
<v Speaker 14>an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So it has for the most part people say </v>

1173
01:02:55.521 --> 01:03:00.521
<v Speaker 14>it has to be in there for like 24 to 72 </v>
<v Speaker 14>hours for that to be a transmitted.</v>

1174
01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm very glad it was in there for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>two days.</v>

1175
01:03:05.621 --> 01:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>So very glad you decided to masturbate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that on that when you did.</v>

1176
01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>And I thank you for sharing that story </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

1177
01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>But I'm also curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it you said,</v>

1178
01:03:15.881 --> 01:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you doing out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest?</v>

1179
01:03:17.351 --> 01:03:18.400
<v Speaker 1>You're looking for treasure.</v>

1180
01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.100
<v Speaker 14>It's a game,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I guess hobby with my call.</v>

1181
01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:24.934
<v Speaker 14>It's called Geo caching.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So basically what it is is someone like </v>

1182
01:03:29.651 --> 01:03:30.484
<v Speaker 14>me or whoever else,</v>
<v Speaker 14>Geo caches hide the container somewhere </v>

1183
01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.850
<v Speaker 14>out in the woods or out.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So there's so many.</v>

1184
01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.700
<v Speaker 14>I mean there are over 3 million of these</v>
<v Speaker 14>geo caches around the world.</v>

1185
01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:40.953
<v Speaker 14>Basically people go look for them,</v>
<v Speaker 14>they use gps coordinates to find where </v>

1186
01:03:43.301 --> 01:03:44.710
<v Speaker 14>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Once you're in the location</v>

1187
01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.550
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to try to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

1188
01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.470
<v Speaker 1>is there something valuable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you find what's going on in this box?</v>

1189
01:03:51.471 --> 01:03:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Is it other than just text with lyme </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease?</v>

1190
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:55.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there won't be.</v>

1191
01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:57.123
<v Speaker 1>It won't be.</v>

1192
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:59.980
<v Speaker 14>The rule is if you take something out of</v>
<v Speaker 14>it,</v>

1193
01:03:59.981 --> 01:04:01.600
<v Speaker 14>you're supposed to put something back </v>
<v Speaker 14>in.</v>

1194
01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.333
<v Speaker 1>Do you still.</v>

1195
01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:07.810
<v Speaker 14>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 14>what was that?</v>

1196
01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you still geocache for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless.</v>

1197
01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:15.920
<v Speaker 14>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it definitely has ruined being outdoors.</v>

1198
01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.490
<v Speaker 14>I'm way more paranoid now.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Whenever I am out in the woods.</v>

1199
01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.880
<v Speaker 14>I used to like pick check only whenever </v>
<v Speaker 14>I got back to the car after I was done.</v>

1200
01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:26.630
<v Speaker 14>Now it's like every</v>

1201

<v Speaker 1>20 to 30 minutes on the trail and like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me check.</v>

<v Speaker 2>base,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.990
<v Speaker 2>I went on a few of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't live in the house.</v>

1236
01:05:58.991 --> 01:06:03.991

01:06:07.001 --> 01:06:09.820
<v Speaker 2>outside?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget about Geo caching.</v>

1239
01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.990
<v Speaker 2>That's way too high level.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That was a great story.</v>

1242
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.270
<v Speaker 4>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had a tick before.</v>

1244
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:21.490
<v Speaker 4>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I have lyme disease.</v>

1245
01:06:21.491 --> 01:06:26.491
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's why I'm so lazy when.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be great to have an excuse now.</v>

1246
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.110
<v Speaker 4>It's dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1247
01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:30.670
<v Speaker 4>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

1248
01:06:30.671 --> 01:06:31.504
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking little creature burrowed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but lyme disease is more prevalent on </v>

1249
01:06:37.701 --> 01:06:39.300
<v Speaker 4>the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Let's move on.</v>

1253

<v Speaker 4>She had a common.</v>

1255
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:59.900
<v Speaker 4>I love these stories about place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now let me.</v>

1256
01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.190
<v Speaker 4>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me say this guy.</v>

1257
01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:04.610
<v Speaker 4>I respect police officers or respect the</v>
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>

1258
01:07:04.611 --> 01:07:09.611
<v Speaker 4>I respect what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have a lot of buts.</v>

1259
01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.113
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you signed up for a dangerous job and </v>

1260
01:07:16.401 --> 01:07:21.401
<v Speaker 4>you're well compensated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can go work in a fucking cafe if you</v>

1261
01:07:25.581 --> 01:07:29.670
<v Speaker 4>don't want to be in harm's way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1262
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:34.310
<v Speaker 4>Nobody asked you or forced you to sign </v>
<v Speaker 4>up to be a cop.</v>

1263
01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.890
<v Speaker 4>The same goes for the military and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.170
<v Speaker 4>but my opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right opinions,</v>

1265
01:07:39.171 --> 01:07:42.350
<v Speaker 4>and if you disagree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just clearly wrong.</v>

1266
01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.420
<v Speaker 4>Why do I first of all</v>

1267
01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.653
<v Speaker 2>back when the story so people can join </v>
<v Speaker 2>your 87 year old woman while cutting </v>

1268
01:07:50.911 --> 01:07:54.240
<v Speaker 2>dandelion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no justification.</v>

1269
01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell the story though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm on A.</v>

<v Speaker 4>military.</v>

1272
01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.630
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just finish this one point.</v>

1273
01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:09.820
<v Speaker 4>As you tried to save me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Being in the military doesn't make you a</v>

1274
01:08:09.821 --> 01:08:12.460
<v Speaker 4>hero by default,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but thank you for your service.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

1278
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 2>a risky job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there.</v>

1279
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 2>It's the first part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Go.</v>

1280
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:22.400

<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>

1281
01:08:22.401 --> 01:08:23.234
<v Speaker 2>Same with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You walk around with a gun on your hip </v>

1282

<v Speaker 2>it's dangerous and you signed up for it.</v>

1283
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:28.363
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you automatically a hero</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't mean that you have the </v>

1284
01:08:31.911 --> 01:08:36.530
<v Speaker 2>right to never be in harm's way because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the police training in the United States</v>

1285
01:08:36.531 --> 01:08:37.364
<v Speaker 2>is basically if you are any risk shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill deadly force when you're </v>

1286
01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:44.504
<v Speaker 2>confronted with the 87 year old woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a steak knife in her hand that was </v>

1287
01:08:48.861 --> 01:08:52.190
<v Speaker 2>used to cut dandelions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is adorable,</v>

1288
01:08:52.191 --> 01:08:56.060
<v Speaker 2>as fucking gets to make a salad for a </v>

01:09:03.111 --> 01:09:05.280
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

<v Speaker 2>boys and girls club,</v>

1296

<v Speaker 2>but they call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was probably a little dementia or a </v>

1297
01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.460
<v Speaker 2>little senile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and she seems lost.</v>

1300
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:26.510

<v Speaker 2>She seems lost.</v>

1304
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.073
<v Speaker 2>That's why he calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the police show up with arms with </v>

<v Speaker 4>The police chief was there during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>incident,</v>

1398
01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.310
<v Speaker 4>deployed the Taser rather than using </v>
<v Speaker 4>deadly force.</v>

1399
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:54.630
<v Speaker 4>He says his officer acted appropriately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her family says that her age,</v>

1400
01:14:54.631 --> 01:14:57.180
<v Speaker 4>the shock could have killed her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's recovering.</v>

1401
01:14:57.181 --> 01:14:57.741
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1402
01:14:57.741 --> 01:14:58.610
<v Speaker 4>it's still little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Kyla,</v>

1403
01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:02.060
<v Speaker 4>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody should be tasered but especially.</v>

1404
01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:05.160
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if it's like a 30 year old man,</v>

1405
01:15:05.161 --> 01:15:07.350
<v Speaker 4>a young 18 year old man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>

1406
01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.033
<v Speaker 4>sure protect yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I love that the police chief comes </v>

1407
01:15:13.921 --> 01:15:14.970
<v Speaker 4>out and is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1408
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.630
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they reacted perfectly.</v>

1409
01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.790
<v Speaker 4>We endorse fully tasing grandma's </v>
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

1410
01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:25.680
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're stepping towards us,</v>

1411
01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:29.910
<v Speaker 4>we're going to take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're walking away from us,</v>

1412
01:15:29.911 --> 01:15:30.950
<v Speaker 4>we'll still you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1413
01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.010
<v Speaker 4>we'll take you in the back.</v>

1414
01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:34.943
<v Speaker 11>MMM.</v>

1415
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:41.530
<v Speaker 10>A little sore from what?</v>
<v Speaker 10>She's gone through facing charges.</v>

1416
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:42.423
<v Speaker 10>And there's one thing we should add </v>
<v Speaker 10>about that young man who was speaking </v>

1417
01:15:44.351 --> 01:15:45.790
<v Speaker 10>out for the family.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Robin,</v>

1418
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:50.970
<v Speaker 10>he is the nephew of this woman and he's </v>
<v Speaker 10>a former police officer and he says,</v>

1419
01:15:51.401 --> 01:15:52.234
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he understands why the officers use </v>

1420
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:55.143
<v Speaker 10>their taser.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He wishes they had used a little more </v>

1421
01:15:57.281 --> 01:15:58.250
<v Speaker 10>common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1422
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:59.560
<v Speaker 10>Thanks for bringing that up,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Steve.</v>

1423
01:15:59.561 --> 01:16:00.394
<v Speaker 10>Very much.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yes.</v>

1424
01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:04.120
<v Speaker 10>The nephew said procedurally the </v>
<v Speaker 10>officers did the right thing,</v>

1425
01:16:04.121 --> 01:16:07.190
<v Speaker 10>but it's kind of like being aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 10>circumstance</v>

1426
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:10.610
<v Speaker 4>procedurally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all good,</v>

1427
01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:15.710
<v Speaker 4>but it's like it's an 87 year old woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love it.</v>

1428
01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.080
<v Speaker 10>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and maybe it was a little tough.</v>

1429
01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.050
<v Speaker 10>Sometimes everything is not exactly by </v>
<v Speaker 10>the book.</v>

1430
01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best part she was being.</v>

1431
01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:24.443
<v Speaker 4>She has to appear in court for like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm cruising around with a knife now </v>

1432
01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:30.870
<v Speaker 4>they're going to charge her to make it </v>
<v Speaker 4>look all kosher.</v>

1433
01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:32.363
<v Speaker 4>Like let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's not waste the justice system's </v>

1434
01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:35.214
<v Speaker 4>time either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's being charged with criminal </v>

1435
01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:40.260
<v Speaker 4>trespassing and obstruction of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>officer.</v>

1436
01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:42.690
<v Speaker 4>You've tasted her bro.</v>

1437
01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.153
<v Speaker 11>So</v>

1438
01:16:50.150 --> 01:16:52.310
<v Speaker 4>I was at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that Rachel?</v>

1439
01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:55.003
<v Speaker 4>You could say that pose revealed the UK </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people want Edra Elba to replace </v>

1440
01:17:00.551 --> 01:17:03.430
<v Speaker 4>Daniel Craig as double o seven James </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bond.</v>

1441
01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:05.170
<v Speaker 4>But here's the catch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isla,</v>

1442
01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:08.450
<v Speaker 4>he's black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1443
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:14.000
<v Speaker 4>he's a black man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently that's caused a lot of drama.</v>

1444
01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:19.001
<v Speaker 4>People say James Bond has to be white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's my take.</v>

1445
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:22.380
<v Speaker 4>You Want my opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isla [inaudible].</v>

1446
01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:23.453
<v Speaker 4>You want to know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys want to know how to feel about </v>

1447
01:17:24.751 --> 01:17:29.020
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

1448
01:17:31.090 --> 01:17:33.790
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love address Elba.</v>

1449
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean people voted for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1450
01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:38.900
<v Speaker 4>what else do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the best part.</v>

1451
01:17:38.901 --> 01:17:39.734
<v Speaker 4>This was a public vote and the UK with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>list of five names and people voted for </v>

1452
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:47.960
<v Speaker 4>Idris and I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now everyone's like,</v>

1453
01:17:47.961 --> 01:17:49.460
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't be bond because you're black.</v>

1454
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:51.470
<v Speaker 4>When I heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1455
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.990
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1456
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:53.300
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

1457
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:55.820
<v Speaker 4>not even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is why I love this story so much.</v>

1458
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.580
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like heartwarming</v>

1459
01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:04.460
<v Speaker 4>how much people haven't thought about </v>
<v Speaker 4>race in this because when I heard that I</v>

1460
01:18:04.461 --> 01:18:07.520
<v Speaker 4>was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just love him as an actor.</v>

1461
01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.620
<v Speaker 4>He Suave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's cool.</v>

1462
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:14.000
<v Speaker 4>He's a bad ass ever since I saw him in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the wire.</v>

1463
01:18:14.001 --> 01:18:14.834
<v Speaker 4>Then in love with him as an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's great and I think he'd be </v>

1464
01:18:16.881 --> 01:18:18.620
<v Speaker 4>an awesome double,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like double o seven.</v>

1465
01:18:18.621 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1466
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:26.630
<v Speaker 4>but apparently a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>unhappy with the,</v>

1467
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.393
<v Speaker 4>with the scoop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact there's a video that some grown </v>

<v Speaker 4>but let's see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody made a really great point here.</v>

1472

1480
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:07.570
<v Speaker 4>He's a bad ass of all the things I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>about when I think of double seven white</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's not on the list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.420
<v Speaker 4>Is that just white people?</v>

1514
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:49.423
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 16>Many people love you.</v>
<v Speaker 16>I love how she's like ranting at him.</v>

1518
01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:05.460
<v Speaker 16>It was asked to be included in this bowl</v>

1519
01:21:05.650 --> 01:21:10.470
<v Speaker 4>and he just made a tweet joking about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now all of a sudden like he,</v>

1520
01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.333
<v Speaker 4>he's getting shit for this poll where </v>
<v Speaker 4>people made a popular vote that they </v>

1521
01:21:14.531 --> 01:21:15.520
<v Speaker 4>would like to see him in it</v>

1522
01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:21.860
<v Speaker 16>almost more than you do yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but please can someone on your team come</v>

1523
01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:25.110
<v Speaker 16>up with that own ideas or that own </v>
<v Speaker 16>material?</v>

1524
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:26.123
<v Speaker 16>Must we perpetually crowbar in gender </v>
<v Speaker 16>and color where it doesn't fit our </v>

1525
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:31.743
<v Speaker 16>imagination.</v>

1526
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:36.180
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't his idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all.</v>

1527
01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:36.811
<v Speaker 4>And second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1528
01:21:36.811 --> 01:21:37.644
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like she's the one crow barring in </v>

1529
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:45.030
<v Speaker 4>race isn't a part of James Bond.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just a guy.</v>

1530
01:21:45.031 --> 01:21:45.864
<v Speaker 4>He's despised the coolest spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that he's black is incidental </v>

1531
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:54.830
<v Speaker 4>and he's British by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a cool slick ash British accent</v>

1532
01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.380
<v Speaker 4>when I think James Bond British is what </v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1533
01:21:57.450 --> 01:21:59.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Black or white or whatever.</v>

1534
01:21:59.061 --> 01:22:01.820
<v Speaker 4>He's a British spy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a dope accent.</v>

1535
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:03.890
<v Speaker 4>That sounds cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fucks like crazy.</v>

1536
01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:06.620
<v Speaker 4>He's a bad ass spy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you look down the,</v>

1537
01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:09.530
<v Speaker 4>you know that white snipey?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1538
01:22:09.531 --> 01:22:10.364
<v Speaker 4>The sniper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we stop making everything about </v>

1539
01:22:14.571 --> 01:22:19.571
<v Speaker 4>race?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like no one was sounds good to me,</v>

1540
01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.233
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1541
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:30.270
<v Speaker 16>Thing the way we love these characters </v>
<v Speaker 16>maters as evidenced by the outrage.</v>

1542
01:22:30.401 --> 01:22:33.220
<v Speaker 16>When someone attempts to mess with the </v>
<v Speaker 16>things we love.</v>

1543
01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:38.200
<v Speaker 16>So you see address.</v>
<v Speaker 16>It's not about your color or you.</v>

1544
01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.870
<v Speaker 16>It's about bond.</v>
<v Speaker 16>James Bond.</v>

1545
01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:44.613
<v Speaker 4>How dare she say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love what you're directing it towards </v>

1546
01:22:47.231 --> 01:22:47.681
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1547
01:22:47.681 --> 01:22:51.640
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck did I do as an actor?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's some other thoughts,</v>

1548
01:22:51.641 --> 01:22:56.641
<v Speaker 4>but it's already been a long something </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1549
01:22:57.161 --> 01:23:01.530
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I disagree.</v>

1550
01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.813
<v Speaker 4>I think you'd be great and I hope he </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets it and I'd like to see what going </v>

1551
01:23:05.321 --> 01:23:08.260
<v Speaker 4>to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will not be James Bond.</v>

1552
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:10.780
<v Speaker 4>I like to see what you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1553
01:23:10.781 --> 01:23:11.614
<v Speaker 4>Lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Going to find the footage and just </v>

1554
01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:18.620
<v Speaker 4>destroy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like a threat does.</v>

1555
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:20.740
<v Speaker 4>I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the term.</v>

1556
01:23:20.741 --> 01:23:25.741
<v Speaker 4>Gentlemen of Color.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you.</v>

1557
01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:30.920
<v Speaker 4>Why do you have to put it like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just say black dude.</v>

1558
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:34.400
<v Speaker 4>It sounds less weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a gentleman of color.</v>

1559
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:36.890
<v Speaker 4>Have you met my friend Tony?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a gentleman of color.</v>

1560
01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.333
<v Speaker 4>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1561
01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.251
<v Speaker 4>That's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

1562
01:23:40.251 --> 01:23:42.920
<v Speaker 4>Don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1563
01:23:42.921 --> 01:23:45.080
<v Speaker 4>the black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me.</v>

1564
01:23:45.081 --> 01:23:46.790
<v Speaker 4>They prefer gentlemen of color now.</v>

1565
01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.033
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

1566
01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.393
<v Speaker 16>Evidenced by the outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 16>When someone attempts to mess with the </v>

1567
01:23:51.921 --> 01:23:54.230
<v Speaker 16>things we love.</v>
<v Speaker 16>So you see dress.</v>

1568
01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:55.213
<v Speaker 16>It's not about please don't attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 16>thing and to mess with the things I </v>

1569
01:23:57.891 --> 01:23:59.150
<v Speaker 16>love,</v>
<v Speaker 16>which is being white.</v>

1570
01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How'd I do?</v>

1571
01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:08.400
<v Speaker 4>Did I get through that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need a writing up there every why?</v>

1572
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:10.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys,</v>

1573
01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:12.390
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just my opinion.</v>

1574
01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't think James Bond needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>white.</v>

1575
01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.101
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was saying,</v>

1576
01:24:20.101 --> 01:24:22.500
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where do I saw this one video of someone</v>

1577
01:24:22.501 --> 01:24:27.501
<v Speaker 4>saying that it was like as if a white </v>
<v Speaker 4>person played a black role.</v>

1578
01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:30.110
<v Speaker 4>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see that clip or what?</v>

1579
01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.800
<v Speaker 4>What did I see that Dan?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that too.</v>

1580
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.720
<v Speaker 4>It cracked me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just thinking the last,</v>

1581
01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:35.554
<v Speaker 4>a little chunk of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you finish out that there was this </v>

1582
01:24:37.421 --> 01:24:40.720
<v Speaker 4>great clip that just had me rolling </v>
<v Speaker 4>where she was like,</v>

1583
01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.280
<v Speaker 4>what did I miss?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She says like,</v>

1584
01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.510
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like having a a what?</v>

1585
01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:52.460
<v Speaker 4>That's like having a white person play </v>
<v Speaker 4>coon to Kente from roots.</v>

1586
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:57.190
<v Speaker 4>That's about race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas explicitly about.</v>

1587
01:24:57.230 --> 01:24:59.570
<v Speaker 4>That's about race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same.</v>

1588
01:24:59.571 --> 01:25:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Get dumbed down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me try to find it.</v>

1589
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:04.550
<v Speaker 16>I don't want to watch this video 20 </v>
<v Speaker 16>times though.</v>

1590
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:06.483
<v Speaker 16>A short</v>

1591
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Da.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We watched this short one on twitter.</v>

1592
01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.280
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's finish this.</v>

1593
01:25:12.281 --> 01:25:13.061
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

1594
01:25:13.061 --> 01:25:17.080
<v Speaker 4>We watched the wrong one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could this happen?</v>

1595
01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:24.090
<v Speaker 4>Why did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

1596
01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:27.050
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's pick up from here.</v>

1597
01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:32.100
<v Speaker 16>The Cold War era,</v>
<v Speaker 16>and that's the glory of the thing.</v>

1598
01:25:32.530 --> 01:25:37.530
<v Speaker 16>A throwback because James Bond isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 16>He's written as an upper class,</v>

1599
01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:40.293
<v Speaker 16>are really good white top form with a </v>
<v Speaker 16>silver well connected to play Winnie </v>

1600
01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:50.093
<v Speaker 16>Mandela.</v>
<v Speaker 16>How would the bender and color where it </v>

1601
01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:55.830
<v Speaker 16>doesn't fit and how come it doesn't work</v>
<v Speaker 16>the other way?</v>

1602
01:25:56.250 --> 01:26:00.000
<v Speaker 16>If I was to play Winnie Mandela,</v>
<v Speaker 16>how would that go down?</v>

1603
01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:01.043
<v Speaker 16>She's accounting.</v>

1604
01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:03.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you even.</v>

1605
01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:05.450
<v Speaker 4>Why would you want to play?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man?</v>

1606
01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.160
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what she's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like she's like,</v>

1607
01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:10.130
<v Speaker 4>what if I played a black slave?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How would that go down?</v>

1608
01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:12.553
<v Speaker 4>Pretty bad because it's about race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>James Bond has nothing to do about race </v>

1609
01:26:16.311 --> 01:26:21.311
<v Speaker 4>and power and identity and she's talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the wife of Nelson Mandela,</v>

1610
01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:26.860
<v Speaker 4>so it's like explicitly about apartheid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fictional character that's a real</v>

1611
01:26:27.861 --> 01:26:32.861
<v Speaker 4>person that's black about apartheid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what if I played Hitler and a film,</v>

1612
01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:42.680
<v Speaker 4>I think I would have said a lot of white</v>
<v Speaker 4>supremacists and that's just not right.</v>

1613
01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:47.740
<v Speaker 4>Frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing as a cow what's the issue and</v>

1614
01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.620
<v Speaker 4>if they cost money and I can watch her </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1615
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:53.000
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>white shaft,</v>

1616
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:54.770
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shut the fuck up.</v>

1617
01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:01.160
<v Speaker 4>Shaft was a film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to Belabor this anymore.</v>

1618
01:27:01.161 --> 01:27:04.100
<v Speaker 4>I think we get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I played the wrong one.</v>

1619
01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.800
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1620
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:08.480
<v Speaker 4>would you watch white shaft dealer?</v>

1621
01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:13.080
<v Speaker 7>I actually don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if everything.</v>

1622
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:16.020
<v Speaker 7>Chef,</v>

1623
01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:17.340
<v Speaker 4>what is the chef?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sick.</v>

1624
01:27:19.170 --> 01:27:22.290
<v Speaker 4>Let's move on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Grand jury.</v>

1625
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:23.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not this one.</v>

1626
01:27:25.050 --> 01:27:27.210
<v Speaker 4>We can skip because there was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1627
01:27:27.690 --> 01:27:29.340

<v Speaker 4>and six Pittsburgh basically throughout </v>

1632
01:27:52.391 --> 01:27:53.710
<v Speaker 4>Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1633
01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:58.090
<v Speaker 4>this is shocking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

1634
01:27:58.091 --> 01:28:00.160
<v Speaker 4>Let's start with this video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is horrifying.</v>

1635
01:28:01.230 --> 01:28:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is just plain evil.</v>

1638
01:28:11.211 --> 01:28:12.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know what.</v>

1639

<v Speaker 4>How else would you describe this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Pennsylvania?</v>

1640
01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.410
<v Speaker 4>There is an epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an actual pedophile ring.</v>

1641
01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.940
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just 300 priests.</v>

1642
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many priests are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Pennsylvania,</v>

1643
01:28:25.071 --> 01:28:27.220
<v Speaker 4>but I can't imagine more than like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand.</v>

1644
01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:29.133
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's the number but what </v>

1645
01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:31.670
<v Speaker 4>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that 30 percent.</v>

1646
01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.793
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole state and it just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It kinda pisses me off because you're </v>

1647
01:28:39.501 --> 01:28:42.610
<v Speaker 4>seeing a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these conspiracy theories about like</v>

1648
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:48.070
<v Speaker 4>satanic pedophile rings like this q and </v>
<v Speaker 4>on and pizza gate and all this shit.</v>

1649

<v Speaker 4>He says the world is run by pedophiles,</v>

1650
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:57.140
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>

<v Speaker 4>heard in my life.</v>

1652
01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:02.893
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can you talk about pizza gate when </v>

1653
01:29:05.970 --> 01:29:10.970
<v Speaker 4>the Catholic church is literally a safe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tannic Colt?</v>

1654
01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:18.900
<v Speaker 4>When you have 300 priests systematically</v>
<v Speaker 4>abusing kids and Pennsylvania,</v>

1655
01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.550
<v Speaker 4>everybody in that organization knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's happening.</v>

1656
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the priests,</v>

1657
01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.780
<v Speaker 4>the that's part of the story is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were covering up flat.</v>

1658
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.810
<v Speaker 4>How are they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I and I'm,</v>

1659
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:36.040
<v Speaker 4>am I supposed to believe that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not all participating?</v>

1660
01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:38.653
<v Speaker 4>How can you let that evilness slide in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the church like their whole thing is </v>

1661
01:29:44.541 --> 01:29:49.541
<v Speaker 4>community and serving God and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so how am I supposed to believe that</v>

1662
01:29:50.121 --> 01:29:50.954
<v Speaker 4>over the course of many decades,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can have that many pedophile </v>

1663
01:29:56.661 --> 01:29:57.494
<v Speaker 4>priests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're covering up and you're moving </v>

1664
01:29:59.001 --> 01:30:04.001
<v Speaker 4>them around and you're not all in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not just covering it up.</v>

1665
01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:07.400
<v Speaker 4>Who is all in on it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody.</v>

1666
01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.690
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean everybody?</v>

1667
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:16.970
<v Speaker 4>If 30 percent of the people that work </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you or fucking kids,</v>

1668
01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:18.670
<v Speaker 4>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1669
01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:21.590
<v Speaker 4>What reason do you have to keep that </v>
<v Speaker 4>system moving?</v>

1670
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:25.550
<v Speaker 4>If you find a pedophile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you kick come out and you'll apologize.</v>

1671
01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:27.530
<v Speaker 4>When you have 300 and you're covering </v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

1672
01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:32.300
<v Speaker 4>you're perpetuating a system that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably want to keep going.</v>

1673
01:30:33.230 --> 01:30:34.063
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot more of these guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking kids than just the 300 and it's </v>

1674
01:30:40.491 --> 01:30:45.430
<v Speaker 4>just so funny and ironic to me that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people will go slander and end date,</v>

1675
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:48.820
<v Speaker 4>say dangerous shit like pizza gate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1676
01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:52.250
<v Speaker 4>basically make up stuff and on and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this shit.</v>

1677
01:30:52.251 --> 01:30:53.084
<v Speaker 4>Say Obama is a pedophile when you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>this like an and the shit that you're </v>

1678
01:30:57.651 --> 01:30:59.320
<v Speaker 4>going to hear is going to make your </v>
<v Speaker 4>sprinkler.</v>

1679
01:30:59.330 --> 01:31:04.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is really evil stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just prepare for them.</v>

1680
01:31:05.661 --> 01:31:10.661
<v Speaker 4>And this is shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I sound like a conspiracy theorist?</v>

1681
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:15.090
<v Speaker 4>But I'm basing it on something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1682
01:31:15.091 --> 01:31:16.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you?</v>

1683
01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.880
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody.</v>

1684
01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:21.420
<v Speaker 4>The fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody.</v>

1685
01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:23.880
<v Speaker 4>The whole church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not the,</v>

1686
01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:25.650
<v Speaker 4>not the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the congregation,</v>

1687
01:31:25.651 --> 01:31:29.840
<v Speaker 4>but like all the priests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bishops know the pope,</v>

1688
01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:32.550
<v Speaker 4>the pope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People were saying,</v>

1689
01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:34.590
<v Speaker 4>what was the last pope the resigned that</v>
<v Speaker 4>never happened.</v>

1690
01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:38.160
<v Speaker 4>People speculate that he was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids and he didn't want it to come out.</v>

1691
01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.640
<v Speaker 4>Imagine the pope is raping children and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about pizza gate.</v>

1692
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:47.583
<v Speaker 4>What do you really see?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That it makes me think I do really care </v>

1693
01:31:50.021 --> 01:31:52.510
<v Speaker 4>about kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or is it just a political attack?</v>

1694
01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1695
01:31:55.240 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 4>this shit is so upset about child sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>abuse by</v>

1696
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:01.023
<v Speaker 17>priests.</v>
<v Speaker 17>It found credible allegations exist </v>

1697
01:32:03.011 --> 01:32:03.844
<v Speaker 17>against more than 300 priests and that </v>
<v Speaker 17>more than 1000 child victims were </v>

1698
01:32:08.051 --> 01:32:12.250
<v Speaker 17>identifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 17>What is worse because of lost records or</v>

1699
01:32:12.251 --> 01:32:13.084
<v Speaker 17>fear of coming forward,</v>
<v Speaker 17>it is likely the true number of victims </v>

1700
01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:19.620
<v Speaker 17>is deep into the thousands of Jean </v>
<v Speaker 17>[inaudible] has been working on this for</v>

1701
01:32:19.621 --> 01:32:20.454
<v Speaker 17>us and gene.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Tens of thousands more massive </v>

1702
01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:25.160
<v Speaker 17>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Yeah,</v>

1703
01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:28.240
<v Speaker 17>and it was with countless numbers of law</v>
<v Speaker 17>enforcement,</v>

1704
01:32:28.241 --> 01:32:30.880
<v Speaker 17>prosecutors,</v>
<v Speaker 17>other attorneys within the office of the</v>

1705
01:32:30.881 --> 01:32:34.540
<v Speaker 17>attorney general,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and of course the grand jurors officials</v>

1706
01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:36.940
<v Speaker 17>are saying that this report is the </v>
<v Speaker 17>largest,</v>

1707
01:32:36.941 --> 01:32:37.774
<v Speaker 17>most comprehensive document into child </v>
<v Speaker 17>sexual abuse within the Catholic Church </v>

1708
01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:44.140
<v Speaker 17>that has ever been produced in the </v>
<v Speaker 17>United States.</v>

1709
01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.273
<v Speaker 17>This report took two years.</v>
<v Speaker 17>It was written by 23 Pennsylvania Grand </v>

1710
01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:53.470
<v Speaker 17>Jurors who listened to dozens of witness</v>
<v Speaker 17>testimonies and witnesses.</v>

1711
01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:57.910
<v Speaker 17>You're studying documents about alleged </v>
<v Speaker 17>child sex abuse in six dioceses,</v>

1712
01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:01.360
<v Speaker 17>which involved 54 of Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 17>67 counties.</v>

1713
01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:02.493
<v Speaker 17>The report states that the testimony was</v>
<v Speaker 17>heard from dozens of witnesses and half </v>

1714
01:33:05.650 --> 01:33:08.440
<v Speaker 17>a million pages of internal documents </v>
<v Speaker 17>were subpoenaed.</v>

1715
01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:09.753
<v Speaker 17>It also states that they were credible </v>
<v Speaker 17>allegations found against over 300 </v>

1716
01:33:13.061 --> 01:33:13.894
<v Speaker 17>priests.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Over 1000 child victims were </v>

1717
01:33:15.671 --> 01:33:16.504
<v Speaker 17>identifiable,</v>
<v Speaker 17>but it's believed that the true numbers </v>

1718
01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:23.230
<v Speaker 17>are way more,</v>
<v Speaker 17>way more to the victims were boys,</v>

1719
01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:26.920
<v Speaker 17>but girls were also victims.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Some routines,</v>

1720
01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:27.813
<v Speaker 17>some are younger,</v>
<v Speaker 17>some were manipulated with alcohol or </v>

1721
01:33:30.611 --> 01:33:31.444
<v Speaker 17>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 17>They were raped in various forms and </v>

1722
01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:35.074
<v Speaker 17>fashions and grand jurors found the </v>
<v Speaker 17>church leaders in every part of the </v>

1723
01:33:37.721 --> 01:33:38.554
<v Speaker 17>state preferred to protect the abusers </v>
<v Speaker 17>and their institution above everything </v>

1724
01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:44.284
<v Speaker 17>else,</v>

1725
01:33:44.970 --> 01:33:48.660
<v Speaker 2>every part of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every part of the institution,</v>

1726
01:33:49.410 --> 01:33:50.243
<v Speaker 2>every single time that's a church policy</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect the institution at the cost </v>

1727
01:33:57.470 --> 01:34:02.010
<v Speaker 2>of the abusers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perpetuating a system.</v>

1728
01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:07.680
<v Speaker 2>It's basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What exactly does the Catholic Church do</v>

1729
01:34:07.681 --> 01:34:12.450
<v Speaker 2>at separate kids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1730
01:34:12.451 --> 01:34:15.210
<v Speaker 2>what exactly would you say you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholic church.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1732
01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm disgusted.</v>

1733
01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm repulsed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think it's time to close it down.</v>

1734
01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it's time to lock shop up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that church.</v>

1735
01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Imagine any other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking.</v>

1736
01:34:32.730 --> 01:34:33.840

01:35:45.611 --> 01:35:46.510
<v Speaker 2>care about pedophilia,</v>

1762
01:35:48.150 --> 01:35:53.150
<v Speaker 18>and for a time some of the diocese </v>
<v Speaker 18>sought to prevent the entire report from</v>

1763
01:35:55.081 --> 01:35:58.800
<v Speaker 18>ever seeing the light of day.</v>
<v Speaker 18>In effect,</v>

1764
01:35:58.860 --> 01:35:59.693
<v Speaker 18>they wanted to cover up the cover up.</v>
<v Speaker 18>They sought to do the same thing that </v>

1765
01:36:04.411 --> 01:36:09.030
<v Speaker 18>senior church leaders in the diocese we </v>
<v Speaker 18>investigated have done for decades,</v>

1766
01:36:09.810 --> 01:36:14.810
<v Speaker 18>burry the sexual abuse by priests upon </v>
<v Speaker 18>children and cover it up forever.</v>

1767
01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:17.970
<v Speaker 2>The report states that because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cup,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll let me.</v>

1769
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Almost all of the abuse is too old to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>prosecuted.</v>

1770
01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:23.993
<v Speaker 2>The Orange has issued present moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>against two priests who was out of the </v>

1773
01:36:34.701 --> 01:36:35.534
<v Speaker 2>these guys have passed the statute of </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitation and can no longer be charged </v>

1774
01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:41.270
<v Speaker 2>extra for two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1775
01:36:41.271 --> 01:36:43.880
<v Speaker 2>that's a criminal organization that </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows what it's doing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let's give them tax exemption.</v>

1778
01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Let's make sure they never have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've got about this.</v>

1781
01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:00.673
<v Speaker 2>This is a quote from one of the victims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George claims that the priest began </v>

1782
01:37:05.661 --> 01:37:10.260
<v Speaker 2>taking photos of him on a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the priest giggled,</v>

1783
01:37:10.290 --> 01:37:12.750
<v Speaker 2>so there's many priests involved in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>one location.</v>

1784
01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Then added photos of him to a collection</v>
<v Speaker 2>of other teen boys.</v>

1785
01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:17.213
<v Speaker 2>According to the grand jury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these men and another priest who were </v>

1786
01:37:19.111 --> 01:37:22.170
<v Speaker 2>part of a ring of predatory priests that</v>
<v Speaker 2>raped children,</v>

01:37:22.171 --> 01:37:23.004
<v Speaker 2>shared intelligence of potential victims</v>
<v Speaker 2>and manufacturer child pornography and </v>

1788
01:37:27.871 --> 01:37:32.520
<v Speaker 2>parishes and rectories.</v>

<v Speaker 2>violence and sadism and raping their </v>
<v Speaker 2>victims reads one line and nearly 900 </v>

1790
01:37:38.821 --> 01:37:40.290
<v Speaker 2>pages of documents.</v>

1857
01:42:28.401 --> 01:42:30.650
<v Speaker 2>same family and collected samples of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>urine,</v>

1858
01:42:30.651 --> 01:42:32.090
<v Speaker 2>pubic hair and menstrual blood.</v>

1859
01:42:34.190 --> 01:42:36.530
<v Speaker 2>This is like you've seen that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true detectives.</v>

1860
01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:39.350
<v Speaker 2>How it's like so sick and twisted beyond</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>

1861
01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:42.710
<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1862
01:42:42.711 --> 01:42:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the.</v>

1863
01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:50.660
<v Speaker 2>The phrase stranger than fiction can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>make this shit up and Harrisburg.</v>

1864
01:42:56.961 --> 01:42:57.794
<v Speaker 2>A priests raped a seven year old girl </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was in a hospital after her tonsils </v>

<v Speaker 2>were removed and Pittsburgh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

1866
01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.540
<v Speaker 2>This is just the highlights that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>

1867
01:43:09.410 --> 01:43:12.260
<v Speaker 2>and this is just one state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one area,</v>

1868
01:43:12.650 --> 01:43:13.483
<v Speaker 2>and Pittsburgh Church church officials </v>
<v Speaker 2>said that a 15 year old boy pursued and </v>

1869
01:43:17.241 --> 01:43:21.650
<v Speaker 2>literally seduced a priest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>church officials.</v>

1870
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:22.603
<v Speaker 2>That was their statement and the fence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the priest that a 15 year old boy </v>

1871
01:43:27.351 --> 01:43:31.190

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1872

<v Speaker 2>A church report later acknowledged that </v>

1873
01:43:35.601 --> 01:43:36.434
<v Speaker 2>the priest had admitted to Sado </v>
<v Speaker 2>masochistic activities with several </v>

<v Speaker 2>their library card is being revoked.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there for several more years.</v>

1926
01:46:36.461 --> 01:46:41.461
<v Speaker 8>neighborhood that was like a religious </v>
<v Speaker 8>neighbor that um,</v>

1927
01:46:42.370 --> 01:46:46.030
<v Speaker 8>I guess they had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what you call it,</v>

1928
01:46:46.031 --> 01:46:48.340
<v Speaker 8>where you go to classes when they teach </v>
<v Speaker 8>you there,</v>

01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:51.150
<v Speaker 8>they talk about the Torah and they teach</v>
<v Speaker 8>you.</v>

1930
01:46:52.050 --> 01:46:56.970
<v Speaker 8>So like on Saturdays they would tell all</v>
<v Speaker 8>the kids in the neighborhood to come and</v>

1931
01:46:56.971 --> 01:47:00.140

<v Speaker 8>Sorry.</v>

1932
01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:02.730
<v Speaker 8>I remember wanting to go and my dad was </v>
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

1933
01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:06.540
<v Speaker 8>he knows something was up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're not going to this stuff.</v>

1934
01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:10.320
<v Speaker 8>Because like now that I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's pretty weird.</v>

1935
01:47:10.321 --> 01:47:12.240
<v Speaker 8>Why are you inviting kids and giving </v>
<v Speaker 8>them pups?</v>

1936
01:47:12.330 --> 01:47:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want all the kids over there?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1939
01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:24.690

<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

1940
01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.460
<v Speaker 2>That was really slick of your dad by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1941
01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:27.353

<v Speaker 2>I wonder if people knew or if he just </v>

1942
01:47:28.411 --> 01:47:30.520
<v Speaker 2>had the insight or if he had.</v>

1943
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:34.260
<v Speaker 8>It's very paranoid about this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 8>for a good rhythm.</v>

1944
01:47:38.110 --> 01:47:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so ironic obviously that like under</v>

1945
01:47:41.291 --> 01:47:46.291
<v Speaker 2>the guise of God and this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution of Christ is the most evil,</v>

1946
01:47:48.190 --> 01:47:51.240
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil shit.</v>

1947
01:47:51.250 --> 01:47:52.083
<v Speaker 2>We all agree and this society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody agrees like child rapists are </v>

1948
01:47:55.721 --> 01:47:57.790
<v Speaker 2>like the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1949
01:47:58.050 --> 01:47:58.990
<v Speaker 2>We all agree.</v>

1950
01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:01.953
<v Speaker 11>Hmm.</v>

1951
01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:06.900
<v Speaker 2>Somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at this point,</v>

1952
01:48:06.901 --> 01:48:09.810
<v Speaker 2>if you give your church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you give your kid over to the church,</v>

1953
01:48:09.811 --> 01:48:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty much taking a crap shoot.</v>

1954
01:48:14.250 --> 01:48:15.083
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a really good chance </v>

1955
01:48:17.521 --> 01:48:22.521
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get molested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that shit.</v>

1958
01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.353
<v Speaker 2>all of these stupid fucking conspiracies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are ruined it with like so little </v>

1959
01:48:39.161 --> 01:48:39.994
<v Speaker 2>evidence that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no evidence it took a total </v>

1960
01:48:41.891 --> 01:48:42.724
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy that are fucking with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have nothing to do with this shit </v>

1961

<v Speaker 2>and they're ignoring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's making a joke of this serious </v>

1962
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.823
<v Speaker 2>actual or they're just using it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>political attack and it's can't be more </v>

1963
01:48:57.671 --> 01:48:59.950
<v Speaker 2>obvious than this because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the church,</v>

1964
01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:04.390
<v Speaker 2>but somehow Obama's pedophile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton's a pedophile.</v>

01:49:19.130 --> 01:49:22.310
<v Speaker 2>that evilness for so long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It continued to exist.</v>

1970
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:25.130
<v Speaker 2>They should be ran out.</v>

1971
01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:27.513
<v Speaker 8>I really wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what did the normal people think like </v>

1972
01:49:30.911 --> 01:49:32.360
<v Speaker 8>actual religious people.</v>

1973
01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:37.670
<v Speaker 2>I would like to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we get calls of Catholics</v>

1974
01:49:40.230 --> 01:49:43.410
<v Speaker 8>like you got to assume that you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>oppressed is most likely</v>

1975
01:49:43.650 --> 01:49:46.570
<v Speaker 2>a pedophile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really curious what people are going</v>

1976
01:49:46.571 --> 01:49:50.680
<v Speaker 2>to think mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's covering it up at,</v>

1977
01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:51.641
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>

1978
01:49:51.641 --> 01:49:52.460
<v Speaker 2>what's the number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight.</v>

1979
01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:53.021
<v Speaker 2>Eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight.</v>

1980
01:49:53.021 --> 01:49:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>

1981
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Dan hotmail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight hot meme.</v>

1982
01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Which seems if there's any Catholics </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>

1983
01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to clear the call queue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're on the.</v>

1984
01:50:00.810 --> 01:50:02.080
<v Speaker 2>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've been holding.</v>

1985
01:50:02.081 --> 01:50:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Sorry guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're getting hung up on.</v>

1986
01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's a Catholic listening that has</v>

1987
01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 2>a strong opinion about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a call.</v>

1988
01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in people that disagree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

1989
01:50:11.441 --> 01:50:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear how you think I'm wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the church this week.</v>

1990
01:50:16.130 --> 01:50:19.780
<v Speaker 2>We with what they know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1991
01:50:19.781 --> 01:50:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying like close it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is it not as bad as.</v>

1992
01:50:23.441 --> 01:50:24.274
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems like unarguably bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but either way I want to know what </v>

1993
01:50:27.911 --> 01:50:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Catholics think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So meanwhile as we populate some,</v>

1994
01:50:32.531 --> 01:50:37.531
<v Speaker 2>cause we've got the casting thing that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really care about honestly.</v>

1995
01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:41.770
<v Speaker 2>And then we've got the this I do like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Spacey,</v>

1996
01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:44.853
<v Speaker 2>Billionaire Boys Club movie came out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it earned $126 on opening day was a </v>

1997
01:50:52.811 --> 01:50:57.811
<v Speaker 2>limited release who was on like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>theaters but still okay with $126.</v>

1998
01:50:58.541 --> 01:51:00.820
<v Speaker 2>That's like 10 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually less probably.</v>

1999
01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:05.560
<v Speaker 2>That's just friends and family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not even friends and family.</v>

2000
01:51:05.561 --> 01:51:08.230
<v Speaker 2>There was like thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in that movie.</v>

2001
01:51:08.231 --> 01:51:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Probably 126 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

2002
01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:14.230
<v Speaker 2>you could make that work in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

2003
01:51:15.130 --> 01:51:15.963
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one person can fuck up at home </v>

2004
01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:18.591
<v Speaker 2>project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2005
01:51:18.591 --> 01:51:19.424
<v Speaker 2>for everyone involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it was a really awful movie </v>

2006
01:51:21.551 --> 01:51:22.384
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw in rotten tomatoes they had like </v>

2007
01:51:24.131 --> 01:51:29.131
<v Speaker 2>five percent or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean the name billionaire boys club</v>

2008
01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:35.460
<v Speaker 2>get a better name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be embarrassing though.</v>

2009
01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:40.430
<v Speaker 2>You should have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say it.</v>

2010
01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I was going to make a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably inappropriate.</v>

2011
01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:48.010
<v Speaker 2>As inappropriate as raping kids as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>priest though.</v>

2012
01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:49.113
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I should get a little more </v>

2013
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:55.190
<v Speaker 2>leeway on things.</v>

2014
01:51:57.780 --> 01:51:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I am,</v>

2015
01:51:59.130 --> 01:51:59.963
<v Speaker 2>has been a longtime February of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast at the podcast of the shell of </v>

2016
01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:04.740
<v Speaker 2>HDHP productions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>

2017
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I've enjoyed Williams antics because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2018
01:52:08.190 --> 01:52:10.290
<v Speaker 2>as far as I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's musically talented,</v>

2019
01:52:10.291 --> 01:52:14.350
<v Speaker 2>I guess not my style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's very socially challenged and,</v>

2020
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:19.390
<v Speaker 2>and he thinks he's very suave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to be Kanye.</v>

2021
01:52:21.090 --> 01:52:22.950
<v Speaker 2>He thinks he's Kanye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

2022
01:52:23.070 --> 01:52:26.700
<v Speaker 2>He is Kanye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I am afraid he might be Kanye,</v>

2023
01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:28.733
<v Speaker 2>but without the Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's more of like straight up con now </v>

2024
01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:35.820
<v Speaker 2>that I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

2025
01:52:35.850 --> 01:52:37.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call him a calm,</v>

2026
01:52:37.021 --> 01:52:39.150
<v Speaker 2>but he's definitely a goofball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just kidding.</v>

2027
01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:42.810
<v Speaker 2>So by my to the joy of this rabbit hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go down right now.</v>

2028
01:52:43.290 --> 01:52:44.123

<v Speaker 2>And then I found out that there's </v>

2029
01:52:47.841 --> 01:52:52.400
<v Speaker 2>actually a subreddit dedicated called </v>
<v Speaker 2>cringe.</v>

2030
01:52:52.401 --> 01:52:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

2036
01:53:14.110 --> 01:53:16.620
<v Speaker 13>Just can't decide.</v>

2037
01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:20.293
<v Speaker 19>Does not mean the folks that go home,</v>
<v Speaker 19>we don't figure out how we work </v>

2038
01:53:24.191 --> 01:53:25.810
<v Speaker 19>together.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Um,</v>

2039
01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:31.020
<v Speaker 19>so this is for the show and what I think</v>
<v Speaker 19>will be great for the finals has nothing</v>

2040
01:53:32.831 --> 01:53:36.580
<v Speaker 19>to do with how I feel about you being an</v>
<v Speaker 19>artist moving forward.</v>

2041
01:53:37.090 --> 01:53:39.240
<v Speaker 19>So that name is that name.</v>

2042
01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:42.350
<v Speaker 13>They're running at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Really running out of time.</v>

2043
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:45.163
<v Speaker 19>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Wait,</v>

2044
01:53:45.330 --> 01:53:46.220
<v Speaker 19>I'm gonna let Jennifer.</v>

2045
01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:59.900
<v Speaker 13>I know it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>

2046
01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:03.510
<v Speaker 13>let's have a name.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>

2047
01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:08.640
<v Speaker 13>that's really enough.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's going to be going to be</v>

2048
01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:16.810
<v Speaker 19>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Got It.</v>

2049
01:54:16.810 --> 01:54:18.110
<v Speaker 19>This is the hardest thing.</v>

2050
01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:24.860
<v Speaker 13>Get on with it much to this show.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And then when he says it,</v>

2051
01:54:28.691 --> 01:54:29.524
<v Speaker 13>nobody cares.</v>

2052
01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:33.560
<v Speaker 19>I just want them to stop the music.</v>

2053
01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:36.513
<v Speaker 13>Tanya,</v>

2054
01:54:42.610 --> 01:54:43.443
<v Speaker 2>kind of a goofy and not that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like it really more about the fact </v>

2055
01:54:47.811 --> 01:54:52.811
<v Speaker 2>that there's a cringe I am subreddit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then I hopped on over there and I</v>

2056
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:54.560
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2057
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:55.783
<v Speaker 2>there is some good stuff here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So kind of want to go down the list of </v>

2058
01:55:00.591 --> 01:55:04.040
<v Speaker 2>cringe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am top of all time and now this one is</v>

2059
01:55:04.041 --> 01:55:04.874
<v Speaker 2>really pointed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's very educational and </v>

2060
01:55:07.450 --> 01:55:07.790
<v Speaker 2>maintenance.</v>

2061
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:10.910
<v Speaker 4>Were you a little bit as well?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Startup of the year guide,</v>

2062
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:14.570
<v Speaker 4>tip of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What makes a great logo?</v>

2063
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:19.850
<v Speaker 4>First off your logo has to be just as </v>
<v Speaker 4>impactful in black and white.</v>

2064
01:55:19.970 --> 01:55:22.480
<v Speaker 4>Kind of reminds me of that kid is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will.</v>

2065
01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:25.390
<v Speaker 2>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got you got my dream is do you</v>

2066
01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:33.160
<v Speaker 4>sure if your logo is not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean then there's a problem.</v>

2067
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:38.480
<v Speaker 4>He has like his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know very,</v>

2068
01:55:38.490 --> 01:55:39.323
<v Speaker 4>very slick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His eyes or he can't make eye contact </v>

2069
01:55:41.211 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 4>and he started on drugs or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>collapses.</v>

2070
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:46.050
<v Speaker 19>When you blow it up really,</v>
<v Speaker 19>really big,</v>

2071
01:55:46.410 --> 01:55:47.243
<v Speaker 19>then there's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 19>If your logo can't transform itself to </v>

2072
01:55:52.381 --> 01:55:55.680
<v Speaker 19>other things and you still know what </v>
<v Speaker 19>that logo is and there's a problem,</v>

2073
01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:58.880
<v Speaker 19>so you should be able to have all those </v>
<v Speaker 19>things.</v>

2074
01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:03.210
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing in the there two </v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras and have a camera there and he's</v>

2075
01:56:03.211 --> 01:56:07.530
<v Speaker 1>looking through that camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not using the character but he's</v>

2076
01:56:07.531 --> 01:56:08.364
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's supposed to switch </v>

2077
01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:12.780
<v Speaker 1>companies is not supposed to dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the cameras.</v>

2078
01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:13.633
<v Speaker 1>Now they show it when it's not like no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not supposed to dark between </v>

2079
01:56:16.141 --> 01:56:16.974
<v Speaker 1>the cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just wanted like a nice profile </v>

2080
01:56:18.481 --> 01:56:19.560
<v Speaker 1>shot and he's doing this.</v>

2081
01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:21.813
<v Speaker 2>He's doing like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I put that he's supposed to do with </v>

2082
01:56:23.381 --> 01:56:24.214
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's looking kind of in between them </v>

2083
01:56:26.591 --> 01:56:27.140
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2084
01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:31.490
<v Speaker 19>The company's objective on a symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 19>level.</v>

2085
01:56:32.770 --> 01:56:33.603
<v Speaker 19>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 19>Because you have to think of what India </v>

2086
01:56:36.530 --> 01:56:39.010
<v Speaker 19>is going to do to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Right?</v>

2087
01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:41.970
<v Speaker 19>We know it's silicone valley did to the </v>
<v Speaker 19>world with him.</v>

2088
01:56:42.010 --> 01:56:42.843
<v Speaker 19>We know China does for the world,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but what India is going to do for the </v>

2089
01:56:45.501 --> 01:56:46.334
<v Speaker 19>world is they're going to create this </v>
<v Speaker 19>symbolic language because India is </v>

2090
01:56:50.301 --> 01:56:51.950
<v Speaker 19>unique because they speak English.</v>

2091
01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.820
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about about logo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2092
01:56:53.821 --> 01:56:56.350
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about the logo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different alphabet.</v>

2093
01:56:57.250 --> 01:56:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on.</v>

2094
01:56:58.700 --> 01:56:59.990
<v Speaker 2>He's on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's on to something.</v>

2095
01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:02.083
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how he wipes easier read </v>

2096
01:57:03.891 --> 01:57:08.690
<v Speaker 2>jamming or what was the green?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jasmine Green.</v>

<v Speaker 2>A Green Gentlemen.</v>

2098
01:57:10.150 --> 01:57:10.983
<v Speaker 19>So I don't want to pick up a red jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Going to add a whole new type of visual </v>

2099
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:15.783
<v Speaker 19>connecting language to the planning and </v>
<v Speaker 19>symbology and logos are going to play a </v>

2100
01:57:21.521 --> 01:57:22.354
<v Speaker 19>big role on that.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Understanding something just by looking </v>

2101
01:57:25.961 --> 01:57:30.640
<v Speaker 19>at a logo or different symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 19>a new language,</v>

2102
01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:34.060
<v Speaker 19>a new type of font.</v>

2103
01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I can talk and talk about it.</v>

2104
01:57:38.150 --> 01:57:39.480
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2105
01:57:39.481 --> 01:57:40.590
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really that,</v>

2106
01:57:40.650 --> 01:57:41.483
<v Speaker 2>that ultimate saying all you need in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life to be successful is confidence and </v>

2107
01:57:47.171 --> 01:57:48.004
<v Speaker 2>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you have that unshakeable </v>

2108
01:57:50.831 --> 01:57:51.664
<v Speaker 2>confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't even think about anything </v>

2109
01:57:54.281 --> 01:57:56.860
<v Speaker 2>you're saying you never consider what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying.</v>

2110
01:57:56.861 --> 01:57:58.780
<v Speaker 2>You're going to sound to some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smart.</v>

2111
01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we have any callers?</v>

2112
01:58:05.670 --> 01:58:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like we got one.</v>

2113
01:58:10.110 --> 01:58:12.360
<v Speaker 2>What's his name and what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this a call?</v>

2114
01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:17.220
<v Speaker 2>You're saying he's got one on deck that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks will be better,</v>

2115
01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:22.340
<v Speaker 2>so maybe hold off for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay guys.</v>

2116
01:58:24.770 --> 01:58:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Well we've pretty much reached the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to take this call.</v>

2117
01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:33.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm canceling cable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sick of fucking cable.</v>

2118
01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Me and Isla were let you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get cable.</v>

2119
01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:39.573
<v Speaker 2>We got it for the first time ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a few months ago and it's so </v>

2120
01:58:44.201 --> 01:58:46.120
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we said,</v>

2121
01:58:46.121 --> 01:58:47.980
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like cable,</v>

2122
01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:52.560
<v Speaker 2>let's try it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost nostalgic for me because I</v>

2123
01:58:52.561 --> 01:58:54.420
<v Speaker 2>used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember like my parents are there.</v>

2124
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Could you just turn on the TV and </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that will play.</v>

2125
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have to choose all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2126
01:58:59.310 --> 01:59:00.143
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What to watch with Netflix and those </v>

2127
01:59:02.290 --> 01:59:05.170
<v Speaker 2>kind of services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but oh my God,</v>

2128
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:06.183
<v Speaker 2>it's just commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all it costs like $120 a </v>

2129
01:59:10.271 --> 01:59:11.660
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2130
01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:13.773
<v Speaker 2>Which is more than double.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much what it would cost that </v>

2131
01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:19.750
<v Speaker 2>every streaming app,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including like Hbo and Showtime</v>

2132
01:59:20.770 --> 01:59:21.603
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible].</v>

2133
01:59:21.890 --> 01:59:22.723
<v Speaker 2>So then there are so many commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the other day I sit down for </v>

2134
01:59:27.801 --> 01:59:32.801
<v Speaker 2>breakfast and it's at the tail end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the show and I'm sitting,</v>

2135
01:59:33.141 --> 01:59:33.974
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating and I'm just watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials and it's like five minutes </v>

2136
01:59:38.811 --> 01:59:40.670
<v Speaker 2>long by the time I'm done with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>breakfast,</v>

2137
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:41.833
<v Speaker 2>the shows back on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then let's say you don't like the </v>

2138
01:59:44.241 --> 01:59:46.640
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You waited five minutes to see what it's</v>

2139
01:59:46.641 --> 01:59:47.474
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're wanting to switch the </v>

2140
01:59:48.501 --> 01:59:49.334
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2141
01:59:49.490 --> 01:59:53.120
<v Speaker 2>always it turns on on commercials and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's like a knight of fire.</v>

2142
01:59:53.420 --> 01:59:57.050
<v Speaker 2>If you just go channel up through all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the main channels,</v>

2143
01:59:57.140 --> 01:59:59.810
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna hit commercials about 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the time.</v>

2144
02:00:00.110 --> 02:00:02.870
<v Speaker 2>The other 50 percent of the time you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were about to go onto a commercial?</v>

2145
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can watch the same shows on Hulu </v>

2146
02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:11.660
<v Speaker 2>without commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I on cable?</v>

2147
02:00:11.690 --> 02:00:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Why do I have cable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

2148
02:00:14.150 --> 02:00:16.280
<v Speaker 2>The only thing is that you can record </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

2149
02:00:16.281 --> 02:00:19.400
<v Speaker 2>but I mean they never invented that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2150
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:21.183
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the other day our recording </v>

2151
02:00:23.691 --> 02:00:26.930
<v Speaker 2>thing wasn't working and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>recording the shows we want.</v>

2152
02:00:26.931 --> 02:00:27.560
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2153
02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:29.570
<v Speaker 2>so there really is no reason to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2154
02:00:30.770 --> 02:00:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Then the shit that's on their flip flop </v>
<v Speaker 2>flip and flop.</v>

2155
02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:35.773
<v Speaker 2>Pawn stars flip or flop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the dumbest shit that you </v>

2156
02:00:39.261 --> 02:00:40.730
<v Speaker 2>didn't even know existed.</v>

2157
02:00:43.730 --> 02:00:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm happier knowing that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows don't exist.</v>

2158
02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:53.750
<v Speaker 2>There's so many house flipping shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we need more house flipping shows?</v>

2159
02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:56.333
<v Speaker 2>You've got a gay couple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a black couple that a white </v>

2160
02:00:58.321 --> 02:00:59.700
<v Speaker 2>couple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got one Asian,</v>

2161

<v Speaker 2>one red had a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a couple of that's divorced.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're in California.</v>

2163
02:01:06.271 --> 02:01:11.271
<v Speaker 2>They're in Houston or in Florida or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lottery.</v>

2164
02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.273
<v Speaker 2>The lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of definitely talked about </v>

2165
02:01:13.541 --> 02:01:15.980

<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2166
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I believe these shows that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a show on home on this.</v>

2167
02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>with the lottery winnings.</v>

02:02:01.711 --> 02:02:02.544
<v Speaker 2>let's bring her in.</v>

2183
02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:06.450
<v Speaker 2>Gabriela.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for giving us a ring.</v>

2184
02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:09.193
<v Speaker 17>No problem.</v>

2185
02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:11.220
<v Speaker 2>So tell me about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay.</v>

2186
02:02:11.221 --> 02:02:12.054
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been listening to our </v>

2187
02:02:12.431 --> 02:02:16.060
<v Speaker 2>conversation about the Catholic church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

2188
02:02:16.061 --> 02:02:16.894
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's your reaction to what I've </v>

2189
02:02:19.181 --> 02:02:20.014
<v Speaker 2>been saying?</v>

2190
02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:25.150
<v Speaker 17>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 17>a lot of reactions.</v>

2191
02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:26.013
<v Speaker 17>So it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I went to 12 years of Catholic school </v>

2192
02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:32.370
<v Speaker 17>and I'm still a practicing Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Um,</v>

2193
02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:38.520
<v Speaker 17>my personal reaction is usually to just </v>
<v Speaker 17>disconnect myself a little bit from kind</v>

2194
02:02:40.831 --> 02:02:43.630
<v Speaker 17>of what's going on in the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 17>Church and just,</v>

2195
02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:47.230
<v Speaker 17>I still go to mass.</v>
<v Speaker 17>So it kind of worked a disconnect.</v>

2196
02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:51.100
<v Speaker 17>That piece of it just to the priests,</v>
<v Speaker 17>the people,</v>

2197
02:02:51.190 --> 02:02:53.480
<v Speaker 17>the institution itself.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Um,</v>

2198
02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:57.760
<v Speaker 17>because then it kinda gets a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 17>culty and weird.</v>

2199
02:02:58.490 --> 02:02:59.950
<v Speaker 17>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 17>but for me,</v>

2200
02:03:00.370 --> 02:03:03.310
<v Speaker 17>since I grew up going to church,</v>
<v Speaker 17>there's something calming about it.</v>

2201
02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:09.000
<v Speaker 17>But you really have to work to remove </v>
<v Speaker 17>yourself from what's going on because it</v>

2202
02:03:10.121 --> 02:03:10.954
<v Speaker 17>gets down to like telling the priest </v>
<v Speaker 17>will tell you how to vote and what you </v>

2203
02:03:14.381 --> 02:03:16.930
<v Speaker 17>should believe,</v>
<v Speaker 17>what stickley and you know,</v>

2204
02:03:16.931 --> 02:03:19.900
<v Speaker 17>there's a lot of things that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 17>agree with with the Catholic church,</v>

2205
02:03:20.410 --> 02:03:23.680
<v Speaker 17>but I still practice and I still believe</v>
<v Speaker 17>in the fundamentals of it.</v>

2206
02:03:23.681 --> 02:03:25.470
<v Speaker 17>So as far as all the best.</v>

2207
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2208
02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:27.333
<v Speaker 2>I was just gonna say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there anything that I said that </v>

2209
02:03:28.391 --> 02:03:29.224
<v Speaker 2>upset you?</v>

2210
02:03:30.890 --> 02:03:31.723
<v Speaker 17>No,</v>
<v Speaker 17>I think that I think that the sex </v>

2211
02:03:35.571 --> 02:03:38.810
<v Speaker 17>scandals have been going on since I been</v>
<v Speaker 17>very young.</v>

2212
02:03:39.450 --> 02:03:40.283
<v Speaker 17>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and part of the way that the Catholic </v>

2213
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:43.363
<v Speaker 17>Church works is that there the priests </v>
<v Speaker 17>move around from congregation to </v>

2214
02:03:46.911 --> 02:03:51.911
<v Speaker 17>congregation before the sex scandal </v>
<v Speaker 17>started or maybe because they started,</v>

2215
02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:53.253
<v Speaker 17>um,</v>
<v Speaker 17>but they move around from congregation </v>

2216
02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:58.880
<v Speaker 17>to congregation to kind of mirror how </v>
<v Speaker 17>the apostles moved around in preached.</v>

2217
02:03:59.570 --> 02:04:03.800
<v Speaker 17>So it's a way of covering it up was,</v>
<v Speaker 17>oh,</v>

2218
02:04:03.801 --> 02:04:04.634
<v Speaker 17>this is moving to a different </v>
<v Speaker 17>congregation when in reality I'm </v>

2219
02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:10.100
<v Speaker 17>originally from Long Island,</v>
<v Speaker 17>New York,</v>

2220
02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:12.470
<v Speaker 17>or they would move them to upstate New </v>
<v Speaker 17>York.</v>

2221
02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:13.393
<v Speaker 17>So they would all be in one facility and</v>
<v Speaker 17>then that's when the coverup would </v>

2222
02:04:16.551 --> 02:04:17.930
<v Speaker 17>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Um,</v>

2223
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:21.740
<v Speaker 17>so my high school was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 17>they just closed it down,</v>

2224
02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:22.693
<v Speaker 17>um,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and one of the bishops from that whole </v>

2225
02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:28.190
<v Speaker 17>Pennsylvania scandal is actually coming </v>
<v Speaker 17>to long island now.</v>

2226
02:04:28.191 --> 02:04:29.990
<v Speaker 17>So it's been in the news quite a bit for</v>
<v Speaker 17>us.</v>

2227
02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:32.860
<v Speaker 17>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 17>so it's just,</v>

2228
02:04:34.170 --> 02:04:37.070
<v Speaker 17>I don't even the cover up on some of </v>
<v Speaker 17>this stuff.</v>

2229
02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.920
<v Speaker 17>I don't know if you folks are into,</v>
<v Speaker 17>um,</v>

2230
02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:43.010
<v Speaker 17>some of those netflix series that go </v>
<v Speaker 17>into some of the crimes,</v>

2231
02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:43.853
<v Speaker 17>but there's one called the book about a </v>
<v Speaker 17>cover up of a non in Baltimore where </v>

2232
02:04:50.761 --> 02:04:53.790
<v Speaker 17>people were killed and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Yep.</v>

2233
02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:55.233
<v Speaker 17>And I have friends that went to that </v>
<v Speaker 17>church and knew that priests and their </v>

2234
02:04:59.101 --> 02:05:03.160
<v Speaker 17>reaction to kind of the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 17>It's just because the whole,</v>

2235
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:07.230
<v Speaker 17>the whole cover up when he was beyond </v>
<v Speaker 17>the Catholic Church and into,</v>

2236
02:05:07.710 --> 02:05:10.830
<v Speaker 17>if you have Catholics in the police </v>
<v Speaker 17>force that it,</v>

2237
02:05:10.890 --> 02:05:11.723
<v Speaker 17>you know,</v>

2238
02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:14.553
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

2239
02:05:14.730 --> 02:05:16.200
<v Speaker 17>gotten so out of control.</v>

2240
02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:16.930
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2241
02:05:16.930 --> 02:05:17.763
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sound sympathetic to what I'm </v>

2242
02:05:19.051 --> 02:05:19.884
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't seem to have much conflict </v>

2243
02:05:21.601 --> 02:05:25.150
<v Speaker 2>with my claims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2244
02:05:25.151 --> 02:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds very cool to you though,</v>

2245
02:05:27.821 --> 02:05:30.970
<v Speaker 2>the way you're describing it is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got Catholics in the police force,</v>

2246
02:05:30.971 --> 02:05:33.430
<v Speaker 2>you've got them all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all covering up.</v>

2247
02:05:33.431 --> 02:05:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean it sounds very cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

2248
02:05:34.850 --> 02:05:35.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2249
02:05:36.410 --> 02:05:37.243
<v Speaker 17>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I mean if you talked to like some of my </v>

2250
02:05:38.991 --> 02:05:41.550
<v Speaker 17>family that's very catholic very badly.</v>

2251
02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do your parents think about it?</v>

2252
02:05:43.131 --> 02:05:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Because they're probably more old </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

2253
02:05:44.721 --> 02:05:45.554
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to know what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissenting opinion because I'm sitting </v>

2254
02:05:49.281 --> 02:05:51.560
<v Speaker 2>here saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut down the Catholic church.</v>

2255
02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:52.573
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear someone be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear somebody say that's </v>

2256
02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:57.440
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked up for saying that.</v>

2257
02:05:58.630 --> 02:06:00.160
<v Speaker 17>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I mean I would disagree with that,</v>

2258
02:06:00.190 --> 02:06:03.160
<v Speaker 17>right?</v>
<v Speaker 17>Like I wouldn't want the Catholic Church</v>

2259
02:06:03.161 --> 02:06:03.994
<v Speaker 17>shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I would want to see some of the priests </v>

2260
02:06:06.131 --> 02:06:09.130
<v Speaker 17>that were molesting children go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I think that it's,</v>

2261
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:12.730
<v Speaker 17>you're not above the law,</v>
<v Speaker 17>you know what I mean?</v>

2262
02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:15.820
<v Speaker 17>But don't.</v>
<v Speaker 17>But if you talked to what I'm sorry.</v>

2263
02:06:17.490 --> 02:06:18.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2264
02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:18.910
<v Speaker 17>um,</v>
<v Speaker 17>if you talk to.</v>

2265
02:06:18.911 --> 02:06:23.070
<v Speaker 17>Let's go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I got my,</v>

2266
02:06:23.670 --> 02:06:26.310
<v Speaker 17>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 17>So you talked to like my Stepdad,</v>

2267
02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:31.340
<v Speaker 17>he's very conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 17>It's kind of like it's all over now.</v>

2268
02:06:32.610 --> 02:06:33.990
<v Speaker 17>It's all over,</v>
<v Speaker 17>isn't happening anymore.</v>

2269
02:06:33.991 --> 02:06:34.820
<v Speaker 17>It's all over now.</v>

2270
02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:35.653
<v Speaker 2>Kinda in denial about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think it was a past problem that </v>

2271
02:06:38.561 --> 02:06:41.740
<v Speaker 2>people are still digging up dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2272
02:06:41.890 --> 02:06:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're.</v>

2273
02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:47.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming you don't have kids right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2274
02:06:47.681 --> 02:06:48.514
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2275
02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:50.863
<v Speaker 17>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 17>but I have a nephew that was just </v>

2276
02:06:53.511 --> 02:06:54.344
<v Speaker 17>baptized.</v>

2277
02:06:55.180 --> 02:06:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Are you worried about your nephew being </v>
<v Speaker 2>around priest?</v>

2278
02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:05.130
<v Speaker 17>I mean I feel like you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 17>careful with it,</v>

2279
02:07:05.131 --> 02:07:05.964
<v Speaker 17>right?</v>
<v Speaker 17>Like the Catholic schooling is a lot </v>

2280
02:07:09.241 --> 02:07:14.241
<v Speaker 17>different now because there are a lot </v>
<v Speaker 17>less nuns and priests period,</v>

2281
02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:19.830
<v Speaker 17>which means that there's a lot of lay </v>
<v Speaker 17>people that are teaching those classes.</v>

2282
02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:23.210
<v Speaker 17>There's not really a heavy presence of </v>
<v Speaker 17>priests.</v>

2283
02:07:23.230 --> 02:07:24.063
<v Speaker 17>Like yes you go to school it on when </v>
<v Speaker 17>you're in the service of like doing the </v>

2284
02:07:27.031 --> 02:07:31.380
<v Speaker 17>office serving and the things like that </v>
<v Speaker 17>that it seems a little bit more intense.</v>

2285
02:07:31.450 --> 02:07:33.210
<v Speaker 17>Sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 17>But I did.</v>

2286
02:07:33.330 --> 02:07:34.163
<v Speaker 17>I did date one person that anytime it </v>
<v Speaker 17>was brought up but like fly off the </v>

2287
02:07:38.471 --> 02:07:39.304
<v Speaker 17>handle.</v>
<v Speaker 17>So you know that something happened and </v>

2288
02:07:40.791 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 17>something like not great.</v>
<v Speaker 17>So what were the results like?</v>

2289
02:07:45.130 --> 02:07:47.020
<v Speaker 17>The longterm was also that,</v>
<v Speaker 17>you know,</v>

2290
02:07:47.021 --> 02:07:48.640
<v Speaker 17>even if you go to therapy to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 17>it,</v>

2291
02:07:48.641 --> 02:07:50.770
<v Speaker 17>I was still there.</v>
<v Speaker 17>It's like any sort of abuse,</v>

2292
02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:52.900
<v Speaker 17>abuse as abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 17>it doesn't matter.</v>

2293
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:56.670
<v Speaker 4>You sound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sound sympathetic and um,</v>

2294
02:07:57.140 --> 02:07:58.220
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2295
02:07:58.760 --> 02:08:00.890
<v Speaker 4>well thanks for sharing your story with </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

2296
02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:02.690
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>frankly,</v>

2297
02:08:02.690 --> 02:08:03.523
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the truth is if you have an </v>

2298
02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:08.260
<v Speaker 4>instant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2299
02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:09.093
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get in an argument with </v>

2300
02:08:09.711 --> 02:08:12.680
<v Speaker 4>you specifically because you didn't call</v>
<v Speaker 4>to argue with me,</v>

2301
02:08:12.681 --> 02:08:15.560
<v Speaker 4>so that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like if you have an instance,</v>

2302
02:08:15.590 --> 02:08:18.020
<v Speaker 4>you say you don't shut down the church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well first of all,</v>

2303
02:08:18.021 --> 02:08:20.270
<v Speaker 4>constitutionally you can't shut down to </v>
<v Speaker 4>church anyway.</v>

2304
02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:25.130
<v Speaker 4>But it's like if you have systematic </v>
<v Speaker 4>cover up,</v>

2305
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:31.750
<v Speaker 4>I feel like the institution has proven </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it can be.</v>

2306
02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:35.820
<v Speaker 4>Why does it exist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why does it exist at all anyway?</v>

2307
02:08:35.821 --> 02:08:37.470
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to argue with you,</v>

2308
02:08:37.471 --> 02:08:41.760
<v Speaker 4>but thank you for calling God bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Appreciate Jugs and uh,</v>

2309
02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:42.653
<v Speaker 4>wish you all the best I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not looking for people that agree </v>

2310
02:08:49.831 --> 02:08:50.850
<v Speaker 4>with me for Christ's sake.</v>

2311
02:08:53.050 --> 02:08:53.820
<v Speaker 20>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 20>Well,</v>

2312
02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:55.730
<v Speaker 20>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 20>you know,</v>

2313
02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:56.800
<v Speaker 20>most rational people would</v>

2314
02:08:56.840 --> 02:08:57.910
<v Speaker 4>have a hard time district.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2315
02:08:57.911 --> 02:08:58.744
<v Speaker 4>I feel like what I'm saying is fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way because everybody outside all </v>

2316
02:09:03.141 --> 02:09:05.210
<v Speaker 4>over the world and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut down the Catholic church.</v>

2317
02:09:05.211 --> 02:09:07.610
<v Speaker 4>So I'm trying to understand why what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying is fucked up.</v>

2318
02:09:09.210 --> 02:09:09.690
<v Speaker 20>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 20>I think the,</v>

2319
02:09:09.690 --> 02:09:10.523
<v Speaker 20>the one point she made that was </v>
<v Speaker 20>interesting and it's probably true for </v>

2320
02:09:12.421 --> 02:09:13.254
<v Speaker 20>most is that because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 20>that this particular story is about </v>

2321
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:18.143
<v Speaker 20>instances that happened in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 20>I think a lot of people would probably </v>

2322
02:09:21.601 --> 02:09:21.901
<v Speaker 20>think,</v>
<v Speaker 20>oh,</v>

2323
02:09:21.901 --> 02:09:22.920
<v Speaker 20>we,</v>
<v Speaker 20>we clean this up.</v>

2324
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:24.870
<v Speaker 20>It's not like this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 20>You know what I mean?</v>

2325
02:09:25.530 --> 02:09:27.030
<v Speaker 20>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 20>which may or may not be true.</v>

2326
02:09:27.031 --> 02:09:29.520
<v Speaker 20>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 20>But that's probably how they rationalize</v>

2327
02:09:29.521 --> 02:09:29.800
<v Speaker 20>it.</v>

2328
02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:31.940
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to know.</v>

2329
02:09:31.941 --> 02:09:35.230
<v Speaker 4>It's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really tricky.</v>

2330
02:09:36.150 --> 02:09:38.720
<v Speaker 4>Got To be careful on there when do your </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>

2331
02:09:38.721 --> 02:09:39.554

<v Speaker 4>someone who's an active member of the </v>

2332
02:09:41.121 --> 02:09:42.770

<v Speaker 4>you gotta be careful.</v>

2333

02:15:04.490 --> 02:15:05.323
<v Speaker 4>We finally get them in the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of my favorite comedians and </v>

2427
02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:11.110
<v Speaker 4>hilarious and shirtless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if he's going to wear a shirt.</v>

2428
02:15:11.730 --> 02:15:12.790
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

2429
02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:16.930
<v Speaker 4>I prefer shirt speaking frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I leave the choice to end.</v>

2430
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:21.010
<v Speaker 4>I think he wears a chef probably eight a</v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

2431
02:15:21.011 --> 02:15:24.670
<v Speaker 4>He shared it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so tune in on Friday at our usual time.</v>

2432
02:15:24.671 --> 02:15:29.671
<v Speaker 4>I hope you guys enjoyed this and you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been filled in with the right up in.</v>
