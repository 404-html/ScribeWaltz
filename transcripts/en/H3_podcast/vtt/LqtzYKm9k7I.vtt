<v Speaker 1>But I know it was up for it.</v>

19
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>But before we get into all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a little announcement.</v>

20
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Not really an announcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just something I wanted to talk about.</v>

21
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.403
<v Speaker 1>But it may be that Ila is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there's a new thing of the </v>

22

24
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.323

<v Speaker 1>won't be drinking alcohol if she's </v>

25
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.770

<v Speaker 1>So we did it.</v>

38
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

39
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>we don't know yet if anything's gonna go</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

40
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>She's pregnant.</v>

41
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 2>You look pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have been,</v>

42
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I've been wording</v>

43
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>and Isla for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

44
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

45
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.030
<v Speaker 1>we've been to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

46
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

47
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.833
<v Speaker 1>It's been on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about it a lot on the </v>

48
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a natural extension of our core,</v>

49
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.083
<v Speaker 1>of our efforts to get Ila knocked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have been a fully unchaste about </v>

50
00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick has been out</v>

51
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.040
<v Speaker 3>and wording.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did the test,</v>

52
00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:05.720
<v Speaker 3>we did everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'll say that we got,</v>

53
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 3>it happened naturally and just the good </v>
<v Speaker 3>old fashioned way you had sex grubs.</v>

54
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

55
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 3>I know it is gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

56
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to feel about it.</v>

57
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like two days ago,</v>

58
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 3>two days ago we found out and Ila,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she will admit was a couple days late on</v>

59
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:31.710
<v Speaker 3>her period and her boobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

60
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 3>were Ra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would you say tender?</v>

61
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 3>What your boobs were tender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just hurts.</v>

62
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some tender as pity.</v>

63
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.863
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like what happens when you're </v>

64
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 3>getting the period and I remember it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a week earlier like,</v>

65
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting my period not happening.</v>

66
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is going on?</v>

67
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 3>And the night before I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're pregnant jokingly.</v>

68
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

69
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 3>actually I already checked on it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>

70
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.890
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't your first idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Morgan do it.</v>

71
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.733
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

72
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.190
<v Speaker 3>But it's interesting because the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>two months we kind of doing really try,</v>

73
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this shit,</v>

74
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it happens,</v>

75
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 3>it happens and we're just not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pay attention.</v>

76
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.680
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when it happened.</v>

77
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 3>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

78
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know how to feel about it.</v>

79
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to feel about it.</v>

80
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more scared than you because you got</v>

81
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:31.910
<v Speaker 3>to shit it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I I'm not,</v>

82
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 3>I have utmost respect for that.</v>

83
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.363
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people always say like don't tell </v>

84
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 3>until,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

85
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean Israel even four months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

86
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:46.534
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you're going to see that I'm </v>

87
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:50.070
<v Speaker 3>pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was just superstitious,</v>

88
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

89
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 3>but you had a really good point about </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe something will go wrong,</v>

90
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's like if that happens then what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not supposed to talk about it.</v>

91
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a secret like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

92
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:02.674
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just carry this like sad thing you </v>

93
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:04.864
<v Speaker 3>can do and you don't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the theory is I think first of </v>

94
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are superstitious.</v>

95
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for those that don't know,</v>

96
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 3>in the first like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

97
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.323
<v Speaker 3>a couple of months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very common that you could have a </v>

98
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 3>miscarriage and I didn't move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

99
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Because it's like you don't talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

100
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 3>Why not talk about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you'll say when you were sick,</v>

101
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 3>you'll talk about it.</v>

102
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if you have to do a surgery.</v>

103
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 3>So why is it that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

104
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a,</v>

105
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 3>it's a sad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a vulnerable thing and it's kind of</v>

106
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 3>sucks to just carry that sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay with you.</v>

107
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:39.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

108
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.383
<v Speaker 3>I guess the theory is that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would probably just are </v>

109
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 3>superstitious about it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

110
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.883
<v Speaker 3>maybe it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people have like many </v>

111
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:50.224
<v Speaker 3>miscarriages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could happen like five times and </v>

112
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:53.560
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>

113
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:54.394
<v Speaker 3>I got to do this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole congratulate were not </v>

114
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 3>pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're pregnant,</v>

115
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 3>we're not</v>

116
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.903
<v Speaker 1>putting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.223
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isla approached me a couple of days ago </v>

118
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in bed just looking at the news or</v>

119
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

120
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we got a problem something.</v>

121
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't answer for a minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>

122
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll just kind of groggy and he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like two stripes.</v>

123
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

124
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>When I did the test I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like there's no way.</v>

126
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

127
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:29.351
<v Speaker 1>we've been trying for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the boys can swim.</v>

128
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.113
<v Speaker 1>It's good to know though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was kind of where I was </v>

129
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 1>worried that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

130
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.101
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you worry.</v>

131
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

132
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

133
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't I,</v>

134
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>why can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't they get in there taking birth</v>

135
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:46.540
<v Speaker 1>control like maybe almost two years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point?</v>

136
00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 1>So it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can take a while,</v>

137
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.923
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

138

<v Speaker 1>so it worked.</v>

140
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:54.614
<v Speaker 1>The boys can swim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girls can catch and the team is </v>

141
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

142
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.010

<v Speaker 1>to the guy.</v>

195
00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:30.250
<v Speaker 1>He's a friend of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though,</v>

196
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.530
<v Speaker 1>even though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he betrayed me after awhile.</v>

197
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.163
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut.</v>

198
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.630
<v Speaker 1>We're not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get there.</v>

199
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

200
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Let's at least get into a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the possible father.</v>

201
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

202
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Reliving the memory of that great </v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayal.</v>

203
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he goes on.</v>

204
00:09:51.911 --> 00:09:55.690
<v Speaker 1>As we touched on in the last episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chain starts exploring this theory.</v>

205
00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.900
<v Speaker 1>What if Logan is the sociopath and Jake </v>
<v Speaker 1>is living in the shadow of Logan.</v>

206
00:10:01.481 --> 00:10:02.314
<v Speaker 1>The sociopath took a weird turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just all became about who is a </v>

207
00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:10.040
<v Speaker 1>sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then like,</v>

208
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.313
<v Speaker 1>well the next episode was him sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like 40 or 50 minutes with a </v>

209
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:15.220
<v Speaker 1>therapist</v>

210
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.363
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

211
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.630
<v Speaker 1>super dramatic kind of,</v>

212
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:21.960
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

213
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.310
<v Speaker 1>She's really dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of trying to diagnose him.</v>

214
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.773
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

215
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.933
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan Paul made a response video and I </v>

216
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:37.050
<v Speaker 1>mean a lot of people have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing Shane for his kind of,</v>

217
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 1>the way that he's been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnose him.</v>

218
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.383
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

219
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.040
<v Speaker 3>cause he does this funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that's there,</v>

220
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.800
<v Speaker 3>him and his editor are really good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they created this like a whore.</v>

221
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.190
<v Speaker 3>They create an atmosphere and a tension </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the editing is very good.</v>

222
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.113
<v Speaker 3>They're good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like you're also talking about </v>

223
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.400
<v Speaker 3>something serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about person,</v>

224
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know Paul Logan.</v>

225
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are like the two,</v>

226
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.070

227
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But regardless,</v>

228
00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even trying to make a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>point about chain.</v>

229
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly,</v>

230
00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:14.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to refute or talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

231
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.533
<v Speaker 1>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan Paul made a response video and </v>

232
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 1>it's given us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>us all here,</v>

<v Speaker 1>across this platform.</v>

234
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:27.630
<v Speaker 1>And so this to me was what was most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to share with you guys.</v>

235
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let logan speak for himself now.</v>

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.540
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he actually says,</v>

238
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a sociopath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do have sociopathic tendencies,</v>

239
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:40.074
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like he's been diagnosed the </v>

240
00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:44.490
<v Speaker 1>way he talks about it because he's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable and he goes,</v>

241
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:50.030
<v Speaker 1>you're not either a sociopath or not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociopath is it's a sliding scale.</v>

242
00:11:50.191 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And some people have more sociopathic </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendencies.</v>

243
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others.</v>

244
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.473
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he goes on to say something that </v>

245
00:11:56.771 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 1>really resonated with me and made me </v>
<v Speaker 1>really understand what he meant by that.</v>

246
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:01.780
<v Speaker 1>So I'll share it with you guys now.</v>

247
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 5>It or sociopathic mark jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

248
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.390
<v Speaker 5>Steve Zuckerberg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs.</v>

249
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.253
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially youtube tubers and Shane </v>

250
00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:13.314
<v Speaker 5>touched on this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't just say like you're a </v>

251
00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:15.534
<v Speaker 5>sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The word I would like to use is </v>

252
00:12:17.041 --> 00:12:19.920
<v Speaker 5>sociopathic tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of us,</v>

253
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.250
<v Speaker 5>me included,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll do some dumb shit.</v>

254
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.210
<v Speaker 5>Maybe some stuff that lacks empathy </v>
<v Speaker 5>strictly for views,</v>

255
00:12:27.211 --> 00:12:28.044
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gets US views which gets us </v>

256
00:12:28.911 --> 00:12:31.860
<v Speaker 5>subscribers are motivating factor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's to reach the next,</v>

257
00:12:31.861 --> 00:12:32.970
<v Speaker 5>next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>next level.</v>

258
00:12:32.971 --> 00:12:33.804
<v Speaker 5>Sociopath is boiled down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone who is just more savage then </v>

259
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.040
<v Speaker 5>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it sounds</v>

260
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.013
<v Speaker 1>so that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's pretty much a clinical </v>

261
00:12:43.611 --> 00:12:44.444
<v Speaker 1>definition of sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who is more savage than </v>

262
00:12:48.591 --> 00:12:51.200
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

263
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.850
<v Speaker 1>I think Logan for that definition and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just think,</v>

264
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.470
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just happy that that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

265
00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Logan Paul saying it's just someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more savage than everybody else.</v>

266
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:04.903
<v Speaker 1>Dabble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dab.</v>

267
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Double Dab will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

268
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.660
<v Speaker 5>Motivating factor if it's to reach the </v>
<v Speaker 5>next,</v>

269
00:13:09.661 --> 00:13:10.770
<v Speaker 5>next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>next level.</v>

270
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.633
<v Speaker 5>Sociopath is boiled down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone who is just more savage than </v>

271
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.470
<v Speaker 5>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

272
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

273
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.563
<v Speaker 1>I have trouble with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having trouble with that comparison </v>

274
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.193
<v Speaker 1>cause he's always making it cool for his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends because they're always like </v>

275
00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Saburn yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what savage means.</v>

276
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

277
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.650
<v Speaker 1>His world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a Sociopath I think Aka ace,</v>

278
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.580
<v Speaker 1>antisocial personality disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is someone that lacks empathy.</v>

279
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Someone who has a general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I again,</v>

280
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an,</v>

281
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

282
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I want to call it sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't call it savage necessarily.</v>

283
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a psycho.</v>

284
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 1>And then Ethan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you go through psychology school?</v>

285
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause I am not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a trained professional because I</v>

286
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:05.770
<v Speaker 1>don't know savage sounds to me it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound very clinical.</v>

287
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it sounds like something you'd hear</v>

288
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:09.570
<v Speaker 1>in a classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

289
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.280
<v Speaker 4>this whole argument though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that between him and Shane,</v>

290
00:14:13.281 --> 00:14:14.114
<v Speaker 4>like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like we shouldn't be this whole </v>

291
00:14:17.931 --> 00:14:21.860
<v Speaker 4>thing about self-diagnosing and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>like even Logan's definition is wrong.</v>

292
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:22.694
<v Speaker 4>Cause I was trying to read about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>online and educate myself a little bit </v>

293
00:14:24.921 --> 00:14:25.754
<v Speaker 4>before I came and did this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And apparently sociopathy isn't even a </v>

294
00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:29.834
<v Speaker 4>clinical term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real clinical term is antisocial </v>

295
00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:35.900
<v Speaker 4>personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's just this whole messy thing.</v>

296
00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

297
00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:38.744
<v Speaker 4>I dunno</v>

298
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 1>everyone always just google lang and </v>
<v Speaker 1>self diagnosis.</v>

299
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

300
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.520
<v Speaker 4>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Logan's defending himself.</v>

301
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 4>He does make a lot of good points in </v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

302
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:51.040
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a sociopath is basically someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's more savage.</v>

303
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.400
<v Speaker 1>So to add that to the Wiki page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

304
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Essentially we need to add that to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical definition of,</v>

305
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's someone that lacks empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much,</v>

306
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:04.574
<v Speaker 1>very manipulative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone that doesn't mean they lack </v>

307
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:08.920
<v Speaker 1>empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cannot relate with human emotion.</v>

308
00:15:08.921 --> 00:15:09.754
<v Speaker 1>So it enables them to do more callous </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that many of us will not feel </v>

309
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:16.610
<v Speaker 1>comfortable doing from an empathetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint.</v>

310
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:21.430
<v Speaker 1>And so I guess that would make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally more savage and a psychopath,</v>

311
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.363
<v Speaker 1>which is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane kept saying a sociopath and a </v>

312
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 1>psychopath of the same thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>applying,</v>

313
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he said it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

314
00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:32.510
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't very clean and very like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it kept mixing them up at some point,</v>

315
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.573
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he would say sociopath and then he </v>

316
00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:37.940
<v Speaker 1>would show psychopath on the screen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone with a knife.</v>

317
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.073
<v Speaker 1>So I was reading about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what is the </v>

318
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:40.820
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

319
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.390
<v Speaker 1>So actually all psychopaths are </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociopaths,</v>

320
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.200
<v Speaker 1>but a psychopath is a more severe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

321
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.010
<v Speaker 1>version of a sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tend to be more violent,</v>

322
00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be more criminal and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be more ruthless.</v>

323
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.010
<v Speaker 1>A sociopath can still have bonds with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like family members and strong friends,</v>

324
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.200
<v Speaker 1>but random people and did the meet on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the street.</v>

325
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:07.790
<v Speaker 1>They do not have any empathy for it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a distinction,</v>

326
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 1>but this implication that they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

327
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:15.140
<v Speaker 1>creepy murders is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not true.</v>

328
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.690
<v Speaker 1>But at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

329
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.190
<v Speaker 1>at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

330
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Then there was a part at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane's new,</v>

331
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

332
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm checking out on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this documentary.</v>

333
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so long.</v>

334
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:28.640
<v Speaker 1>It's too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot.</v>

335
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 1>But this part made me uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to lie.</v>

336
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:31.483
<v Speaker 1>So he's teasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one's called the enemies of Jake </v>

337
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Paul and he is teasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next episode,</v>

338
00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:42.761
<v Speaker 1>this therapist that he sat down with is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go undercover as a producer.</v>

339
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.473
<v Speaker 1>Secretly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to tell Jake Paul so </v>

340
00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:50.660
<v Speaker 1>that she can study him all day and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a diagnosis of him.</v>

341
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.630
<v Speaker 1>It seems kind of unethical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

342
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:55.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean if was all here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

343
00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:56.661
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

344
00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:58.040
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is making me </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>

345
00:16:58.041 --> 00:16:58.874
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

346
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:03.003
<v Speaker 1>Shane does acknowledge that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he knows that it's weird that </v>

347
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.840
<v Speaker 1>still's going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

348
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:12.674
<v Speaker 1>here it is</v>

349
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.570
<v Speaker 6>and she's there the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he's going to be like,</v>

350
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.360
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>comfortable.</v>

351
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:25.361
<v Speaker 6>I think he's going to be kind of fake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I came up with a plan is I'm going to</v>

352
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.870
<v Speaker 6>the therapist to be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's going to be the whole day watching,</v>

353
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.153
<v Speaker 6>listening.</v>

354
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:49.150
<v Speaker 1>I love to shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wash this body language like a corner of</v>

355
00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 1>her eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how she makes her diagnosis.</v>

356
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Like she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is her all day.</v>

357
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I just love the image of this therapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them all day like this.</v>

358
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Just looking at the side of her vision </v>
<v Speaker 1>at them anyway.</v>

359
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.610
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty with straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

360
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:15.780
<v Speaker 1>It's shit strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

361
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here you,</v>

362
00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.030
<v Speaker 6>it's like when the camera turns off </v>
<v Speaker 6>throughout the day,</v>

363
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.480
<v Speaker 6>she's going to take me to another room.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jake will have no idea.</v>

364
00:18:23.481 --> 00:18:26.560
<v Speaker 6>And then we'll go on to the of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll just be like going,</v>

365
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.280
<v Speaker 6>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well first of all,</v>

366
00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:30.500
<v Speaker 6>let me say this g specifically.</v>

367
00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:31.773
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

368
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.570
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It like,</v>

369
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's unnecessary because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

370
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.080
<v Speaker 1>if she went like jake would still be </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself over a long day,</v>

371
00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're at his house,</v>

372
00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.880
<v Speaker 1>well you'll put on a show for like five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

373
00:18:45.881 --> 00:18:46.714
<v Speaker 1>but eventually it'll be himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A sociopath apparently is capable and </v>

374
00:18:50.411 --> 00:18:53.230
<v Speaker 1>well aware of the facade that they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

375
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Actually what I read is that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopath,</v>

376
00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:57.483
<v Speaker 1>so a sociopath generally is more messy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how they present themselves to the </v>

377
00:19:02.171 --> 00:19:03.004
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a psychopath is extremely efficient </v>

378
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.350
<v Speaker 1>that they can have a mask up all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

379
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:12.820
<v Speaker 1>even under stress and duress so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they never let their guard down.</v>

380
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is one of the attributes.</v>

381
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.370
<v Speaker 1>But that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think Jerry is like,</v>

382
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.240
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think jake is a sociopath</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about Jake Paul.</v>

383
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

384
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.710
<v Speaker 1>the thing is he didn't really need this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole angle.</v>

385
00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I would have been interested at just </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

386
00:19:28.781 --> 00:19:31.420
<v Speaker 1>a really sincere look and to Jake Paul's</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

387
00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know why they were down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

388
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that we needed this really </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic angle of sociopathy.</v>

389
00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

390
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:41.423
<v Speaker 1>Cutie pie made a video about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made some good points about a really </v>

391
00:19:43.481 --> 00:19:45.760
<v Speaker 1>long video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was like,</v>

392
00:19:45.761 --> 00:19:46.594
<v Speaker 1>when they were talking about sociopathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and the therapist were saying that </v>

393
00:19:49.301 --> 00:19:51.910
<v Speaker 1>it was like icky and gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

394
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's getting bizarre.</v>

395
00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a wild ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

396
00:19:59.621 --> 00:20:02.680
<v Speaker 1>This is some wild new territory here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are loving it.</v>

397
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>

398
00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:11.110
<v Speaker 1>it's Jake Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's hard for anyone to be like,</v>

399
00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.930
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to ever take cake or</v>
<v Speaker 1>logan site.</v>

400
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.773
<v Speaker 1>Like Logan made a very reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to two chainz video and it has </v>

401
00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:21.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>firstly,</v>

402
00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

403
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was feeling kind of bad that like here</v>

404
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.370
<v Speaker 1>they're down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Votes is like 130,000</v>

405
00:20:30.371 --> 00:20:34.840
<v Speaker 1>down and he didn't really say anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>or did they have a downvote personally?</v>

406
00:20:34.841 --> 00:20:36.670
<v Speaker 1>My pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the world we live in.</v>

407
00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:42.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the tube we tube in and so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to lie.</v>

408
00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:46.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch it.</v>

409
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.270
<v Speaker 1>It seems unethical but I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch the fuck out of it.</v>

410
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got Kevin.</v>

411
00:20:56.741 --> 00:21:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin on this fucking guy,</v>

412
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.413
<v Speaker 1>this cabinet guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to get on the supreme court </v>

413
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.590
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of politics going on here.</v>

414
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:09.780
<v Speaker 1>You guys probably heard of Kevin Hawk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how he was accused of all this.</v>

415
00:21:09.781 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 1>A sexual misconduct which is sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>misconduct.</v>

416
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:16.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice way of saying rape kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

417
00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 1>but regardless of what he did or didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

418
00:21:18.701 --> 00:21:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My only interest in this,</v>

419
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:25.741
<v Speaker 1>my friends is the fact that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing over what is a booth now goofing</v>

420
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.560
<v Speaker 1>is a big part of this show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you may recall,</v>

421
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.770
<v Speaker 1>we have been trying to get to the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what a booth is for a long time.</v>

422
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.740
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right into the equation.</v>

423
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.750
<v Speaker 1>A booth and a goof and a gaf is alive.</v>

424
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.790
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you booth a goof?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we were wondering what's a booth and</v>

425
00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:43.624
<v Speaker 1>Eric from common etiquette came in with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a definition as we were wondering what </v>

426
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Speaker 1>is a boob?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I look it up,</v>

427
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:51.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not actually a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you found it on urban dictionary the</v>

428
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:52.714
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the perfect place to define </v>

429
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:55.654
<v Speaker 1>something like this apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and correct me if your definition is </v>

430
00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:00.520
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's when you shove drugs up your ass,</v>

431
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.760
<v Speaker 1>when you go to a rave or dance party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you boost it in.</v>

432
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.063
<v Speaker 1>We're on the same page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually I've got to revive that </v>

433
00:22:08.831 --> 00:22:09.664
<v Speaker 1>definitional that I'm pretty sure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means taking drugs up the ass because </v>

434
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:13.490
<v Speaker 1>what I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

435
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.270
<v Speaker 1>because apparently the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anus,</v>

436
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.104
<v Speaker 1>the colon is very absorbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absorbative absorbative and so drinking </v>

437
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:23.880
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

438
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.070
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you're doing an Ama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd all be like this,</v>

439
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:28.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this man where it's like I sleep,</v>

440
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I am awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So drinking alcohol in the mouth,</v>

441
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 1>I sleep booping alcohol and your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm awake.</v>

442
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically the,</v>

443
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.780
<v Speaker 1>the aim anus sucks and as way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>membrane.</v>

444
00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:47.230
<v Speaker 1>So if you're taking any kind of elicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug,</v>

445
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.270
<v Speaker 1>you put it up the ass boy and you all </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be get taken that one rate,</v>

446
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 1>right ticket to Valhalla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're willing to do that,</v>

447
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.480
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to taste it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to encounter any beds.</v>

448
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 1>You just boof it right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you shotgun a beer up your ass.</v>

449
00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard there was kids that were dipping</v>

450
00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:12.160
<v Speaker 1>vodka or tampons in vodka and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoving it up their ass.</v>

451
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.023
<v Speaker 1>They get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like she's just drinking his </v>

452
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.520
<v Speaker 1>drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

453
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.580
<v Speaker 1>but apparently you get drunk quicker and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pleasant experience.</v>

454
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:22.870
<v Speaker 1>But I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

455
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>postman is really good at shotgunning </v>

456
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:27.700
<v Speaker 1>beers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how fast you can boot it.</v>

457
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.273
<v Speaker 1>Didn't a friend of the show Steevo uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of those jackass movies moved to </v>

458
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.020
<v Speaker 1>a beer out of like a beer bong.</v>

459
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'd like to see post malone </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

460
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the next rockstar that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

461
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I just like to imagine someone on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>back with their cheeks out in a bunch of</v>

462
00:23:46.911 --> 00:23:51.911
<v Speaker 1>Bros shoving that tube up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude's ass and vaseline ended up by tyra</v>

463
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:55.580
<v Speaker 1>banks and I'm just boof and a beer right</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the stink hall.</v>

464
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.220
<v Speaker 1>What was their ranks doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the vaseline goddess.</v>

465
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Shannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your picture of she,</v>

466
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.970

495
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.250
<v Speaker 1>perjury.</v>

502
00:25:52.121 --> 00:25:55.540
<v Speaker 1>similar moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meme is kind of hard to define.</v>

503
00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:59.620
<v Speaker 1>A booth has a very literal definition is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a flatulence.</v>

504
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.300

<v Speaker 1>to put beer up his ass.</v>

511
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:31.440
<v Speaker 1>He should go down for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying if you're showing us like,</v>

512
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I haven't ever heard that he's a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>word for partying.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's went to Yale so he's not allowed to</v>

514
00:26:37.901 --> 00:26:40.660
<v Speaker 1>say fart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to say flatulence,</v>

515
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:41.853
<v Speaker 1>but what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like that's when you put up </v>

516
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:47.670
<v Speaker 1>your ass that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a joke.</v>

519
00:26:52.561 --> 00:26:56.610
<v Speaker 1>It's what happens is putting beer up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ass and get him more credit.</v>

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:25.610
<v Speaker 4>emission of a full 24 hours for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you are a Kanye mega fan,</v>

697
00:35:25.611 --> 00:35:26.690
<v Speaker 4>is that correct to say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

698
00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.410
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably say top 100 top 100 fans in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

699
00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.800
<v Speaker 4>I'd say so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's wow.</v>

700
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 4>So if you know anyone disputes that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>tried to try me.</v>

701
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 4>So the only way you be a bigger fan,</v>

702
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.873
<v Speaker 7>it's kind of by stocking him and waiting</v>
<v Speaker 7>outside his house and attempting to </v>

703
00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:43.230
<v Speaker 7>murder and wearing his skin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

704
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.520
<v Speaker 7>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're just one step under us.</v>

705
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.500
<v Speaker 7>A psychopathic murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Excellent.</v>

706
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.980
<v Speaker 7>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now what is it about sociopaths?</v>

707
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.750
<v Speaker 7>We shouldn't get any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

708
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:57.730
<v Speaker 7>Now's not the time or place.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He lives at therapist spying on you,</v>

709
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.620
<v Speaker 7>but you gotta give me the side load.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

710
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.430
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>now tell me,</v>

711
00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:04.330
<v Speaker 7>what is it about Connie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that intro?</v>

712
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.011
<v Speaker 7>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

713
00:36:05.011 --> 00:36:05.844
<v Speaker 7>let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are you fans of anyone else who has </v>

714
00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:09.180
<v Speaker 7>Kanye?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like he's your guy.</v>

715
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.180
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of people I like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he's definitely,</v>

716
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 7>he's your guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And what is it about Kanye that,</v>

717
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.793
<v Speaker 7>that you love so much that he's probably</v>
<v Speaker 7>the only person in pop culture that I </v>

718
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.660
<v Speaker 7>get close to sing like role model.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's a role model.</v>

719
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 7>What are the attributes that you look up</v>
<v Speaker 7>to of his,</v>

720
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.220
<v Speaker 7>like how his blame honesty that gets him</v>
<v Speaker 7>in a lot of trouble,</v>

721
00:36:32.221 --> 00:36:35.460
<v Speaker 7>but he feels like one of the only </v>
<v Speaker 7>authentic,</v>

722
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.790
<v Speaker 7>like everything he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even though,</v>

723
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some of it is stupid,</v>

724
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.540
<v Speaker 7>he doesn't hesitate to let you know all </v>
<v Speaker 7>of his flaws or elders issues.</v>

725
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.870
<v Speaker 7>And that's more relatable to me than </v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone else.</v>

726
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.570
<v Speaker 7>He's authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>

727
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:51.750
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>definitely.</v>

728
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.530
<v Speaker 7>And we see all the faults and the cracks</v>
<v Speaker 7>and all of that,</v>

729
00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.120
<v Speaker 7>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

730
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.830
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone's like that,</v>

731
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.740
<v Speaker 7>but he's like one of the few brave </v>
<v Speaker 7>enough to be like,</v>

732
00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:02.520
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is,</v>

733
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.180
<v Speaker 7>this is how I am.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I'm kind of,</v>

734
00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.540
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you're a fan of his music obviously.</v>

735
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.561
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

736
00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:08.394
<v Speaker 7>he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's your favorite musician as well as </v>

737
00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.470
<v Speaker 7>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

738
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.290
<v Speaker 7>I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you seen his sex tape?</v>

739
00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:15.620
<v Speaker 7>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he never made any,</v>

740
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.410
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>did you?</v>

741
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:20.010
<v Speaker 7>Have you seen a sex tape?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

742
00:37:20.011 --> 00:37:21.550
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you think about it and had good,</v>

743
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:23.340
<v Speaker 7>good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not that good.</v>

744
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:26.700
<v Speaker 7>And all these celebrity sex takes are so</v>
<v Speaker 7>underrated.</v>

745
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:28.360
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you think that she,</v>

746
00:37:28.361 --> 00:37:31.570
<v Speaker 7>and they intentionally released that </v>
<v Speaker 7>right eye?</v>

747
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.750
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not quite sure,</v>

748
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:37.770
<v Speaker 7>but it's true that that sex tape was </v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of what put her on the map.</v>

749
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.870
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It definitely helped before that.</v>

750
00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:40.704
<v Speaker 7>And then she was really close with Paris</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hilton and was around in those circles </v>

751
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:45.144
<v Speaker 7>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think I saw on porn hub that the Kim </v>

752
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 7>Kardashians sex tape has like over a </v>
<v Speaker 7>hundred million views and crazy.</v>

753
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:51.331
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

754
00:37:51.331 --> 00:37:53.520
<v Speaker 7>it's like massive on there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's pretty wild.</v>

755
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.530
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

756
00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.850
<v Speaker 7>You've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

757
00:37:56.851 --> 00:37:57.684
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

758
00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:58.430
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's good.</v>

759
00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.150
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

760
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:01.590
<v Speaker 7>you're not missing much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just,</v>

761
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.290

<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

762
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.090
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just,</v>

763
00:38:06.091 --> 00:38:06.924
<v Speaker 7>it's bad angles.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just can't really enjoy the show as </v>

764
00:38:09.631 --> 00:38:11.730
<v Speaker 7>they say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How many times have you watched it?</v>

765
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.640
<v Speaker 7>More than often?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just every once in a while.</v>

766
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.840
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not even recently.</v>

<v Speaker 7>times less?</v>

772

00:41:36.081 --> 00:41:37.820
<v Speaker 7>that is what we're trying to do for the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Matrix.</v>

841
00:41:37.821 --> 00:41:40.820
<v Speaker 7>Kanye d coated the enigma of political </v>
<v Speaker 7>affiliation.</v>

842
00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people are upset about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

843
00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.330
<v Speaker 7>this guy's recent activities.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>

844
00:41:46.331 --> 00:41:47.420
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

845
00:41:47.421 --> 00:41:52.010
<v Speaker 7>it kind of kicked off a few weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He announced his new album,</v>

846
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.113
<v Speaker 7>Yon d uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said it was coming out September </v>

847
00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:00.050
<v Speaker 7>29th.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yani is Kanye and Gandhi.</v>

848
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:05.900
<v Speaker 7>That's not a bold claim.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And here's the album cover.</v>

849
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.810
<v Speaker 7>It's similar to his album from 2013.</v>

850
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:11.240
<v Speaker 7>Yeezus.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So this is the,</v>

851
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.060
<v Speaker 7>these making a play on word that he's </v>
<v Speaker 7>some kind of savior.</v>

852
00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 7>But does he actually believed that </v>
<v Speaker 7>because he is,</v>

853
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.263
<v Speaker 7>has manic states.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Does he believe he is uses probably in </v>

854
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:21.980
<v Speaker 7>those states.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's gets close.</v>

855
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>He's on this whole love thing I'm </v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about,</v>

857
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:32.910
<v Speaker 7>but so he releases this September 29th </v>
<v Speaker 7>and then I gave it a little spin there.</v>

858
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.080
<v Speaker 7>SNL announced that he would be the </v>
<v Speaker 7>highest on the 29th or he'd,</v>

859
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:41.210
<v Speaker 7>he'd be the musical guest.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So everyone assumed,</v>

860
00:42:41.211 --> 00:42:41.901
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's going to come,</v>

00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:26.220
<v Speaker 7>And people weren't quite happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

874
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.940
<v Speaker 7>he launched into his speech at the end </v>
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>

875
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:32.780
<v Speaker 7>he was playing ghost town and then NBC </v>

<v Speaker 7>I haven't seen this.</v>

878
00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.400
<v Speaker 7>And some,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some people are saying,</v>

879
00:43:37.401 --> 00:43:38.234
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was just because they ran out of </v>

880
00:43:38.511 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 7>time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it was right before he launched into</v>

881
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:43.670
<v Speaker 7>his speech and someone recorded it who </v>
<v Speaker 7>was backstage.</v>

882
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:45.430
<v Speaker 7>They cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It never got aired.</v>

<v Speaker 7>main producers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was backstage</v>

886
00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:16.080

<v Speaker 8>Cath laughing in the background.</v>

887
00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:25.890
<v Speaker 8>Superman Cape on this means you can't </v>
<v Speaker 8>tell me what to do.</v>

888
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.230
<v Speaker 8>That's how we control.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's how we're programmed.</v>

889
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.530
<v Speaker 8>If you want the world to move forward,</v>
<v Speaker 8>try love.</v>

890
00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.770
<v Speaker 8>Thank y'all for giving me this platform.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know.</v>

891
00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 8>I don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's killing it though.</v>

892
00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:56.810
<v Speaker 8>90% of news are liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

893
00:44:56.811 --> 00:44:58.910
<v Speaker 8>that can't be true.</v>
<v Speaker 8>90%.</v>

894
00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:03.140
<v Speaker 8>And they do your writers,</v>
<v Speaker 8>rappers,</v>

895
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:04.243
<v Speaker 8>musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's easy to make it seem like it's </v>

896
00:45:06.621 --> 00:45:07.670
<v Speaker 8>so,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so,</v>

897
00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:12.671
<v Speaker 8>so one sided and um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're just stuck up there.</v>

898
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:20.150
<v Speaker 8>Them hold them hostage a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've talked to this country also.</v>

899
00:45:21.911 --> 00:45:24.350
<v Speaker 8>They're very anti trump,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so he's Kinda bitching them out.</v>

900
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:26.223
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

901
00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Got</v>

902
00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:32.840
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

903
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:35.630
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>authentic tender moment.</v>

904
00:45:35.631 --> 00:45:37.610
<v Speaker 3>And to real goddamn shame they caught </v>
<v Speaker 3>them off.</v>

905
00:45:37.611 --> 00:45:38.444
<v Speaker 3>Like that gives you a context to why </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's wearing this hat kind of feel like </v>

906
00:45:42.681 --> 00:45:45.290
<v Speaker 3>they should have kept it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really,</v>

907
00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is obviously very provocative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I understand,</v>

908
00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.513
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate the point he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make of like stepping across the aisle </v>

909
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:54.103
<v Speaker 3>and seeing people as people and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's so easy from the left or </v>

910
00:45:58.161 --> 00:46:00.050
<v Speaker 3>right to just demonize and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

911
00:46:00.051 --> 00:46:02.420
<v Speaker 3>Cause like I wish a while a lot of left </v>
<v Speaker 3>wing,</v>

912
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:03.893
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>media like Jimmy Kimmel and the Steven </v>

913
00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Colbert is and all these guys and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

914
00:46:07.791 --> 00:46:09.740
<v Speaker 3>they talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Bill Maher,</v>

915
00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.260
<v Speaker 3>it talked about the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're just monsters.</v>

916
00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Murray,</v>

917
00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:14.354
<v Speaker 3>who was the only one that actually we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a conversation without her side </v>

918
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:17.690
<v Speaker 3>only.</v>

919
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:21.470
<v Speaker 3>But like G-man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemo treats them like they're monsters.</v>

920
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:22.503
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I appreciate the sentiment and there </v>

921
00:46:25.161 --> 00:46:27.290
<v Speaker 3>was another part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where it went by,</v>

922
00:46:27.291 --> 00:46:28.124
<v Speaker 3>where he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys kind of go at trump like a </v>

923
00:46:31.281 --> 00:46:35.510
<v Speaker 3>little too hard and it's nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't really help anything.</v>

924
00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he told them as well,</v>

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How have people reacted to that clip?</v>

932
00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Not Gray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Gray.</v>

933
00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.530
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

934
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:57.020
<v Speaker 3>there was another one that everyone saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

935
00:46:57.021 --> 00:47:00.620
<v Speaker 3>Chris Rock was in the audience and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was filming it and he's just laughing.</v>

936
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:03.260
<v Speaker 3>Chris Rock filmed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a weird twist.</v>

937
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:06.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on his instagram story and you could</v>

938
00:47:06.621 --> 00:47:09.590
<v Speaker 3>hear him chuckling and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

939
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well what do you expect this Kanye West.</v>

940
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:14.503
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

941
00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:15.403
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird that he would have that risk </v>

942
00:47:16.591 --> 00:47:18.800
<v Speaker 3>surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also I find it,</v>

943
00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:19.663
<v Speaker 3>I find that a little bit rude and </v>
<v Speaker 3>condescending to laugh at a guy who's </v>

944
00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.910
<v Speaker 3>trying to express himself authentically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like listen to the guy,</v>

945
00:47:25.911 --> 00:47:26.744
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of the point that he's </v>

946
00:47:28.551 --> 00:47:29.384
<v Speaker 3>making cause just because he's wearing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hat is immediately labeled like a </v>

947
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:38.650
<v Speaker 3>joke and it's like why can't anyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>where like 50% of the country apparently</v>

948
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.200
<v Speaker 3>supports Donald Trump and rocks that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hat.</v>

949
00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:44.890
<v Speaker 3>So why is it like that when you wear </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hat it's like wearing a swastika or</v>

950
00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:46.390
<v Speaker 3>some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's the</v>

951
00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.790
<v Speaker 7>neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

952
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.983
<v Speaker 7>the hat is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's getting such like a visceral </v>

953
00:47:52.581 --> 00:47:55.550
<v Speaker 7>immediate response from people and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't want to dig deeper.</v>

954
00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:56.630
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's,</v>

955
00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:57.793
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm maybe supporting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>too much because then there's a lot of </v>

956
00:48:01.071 --> 00:48:02.190
<v Speaker 3>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well he said,</v>

957
00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.373
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate the act of trying to </v>

958
00:48:05.541 --> 00:48:09.320
<v Speaker 3>reconcile these very fractured cup </v>
<v Speaker 3>country that we live in.</v>

959
00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:13.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean I had that immediate reaction </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I saw him with the hat on the show.</v>

960
00:48:13.101 --> 00:48:13.670
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ugh,</v>

961
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:16.140
<v Speaker 3>why are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah my wearing that.</v>

962
00:48:16.141 --> 00:48:18.320
<v Speaker 3>And like that was my first reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's all just like,</v>

963
00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all so sick of politics too.</v>

964
00:48:20.691 --> 00:48:21.524
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just fucking make music and entertain </v>

965
00:48:23.261 --> 00:48:23.570
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

966
00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:25.100
<v Speaker 7>Because there's also people that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

967
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.963
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well he's only doing that because he </v>

968
00:48:26.961 --> 00:48:28.340
<v Speaker 7>doesn't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's just,</v>

969
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:30.170
<v Speaker 7>he's in the headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>

970
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:31.783
<v Speaker 7>I don't believe that because he kept </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing after his last album came out a </v>

971
00:48:35.521 --> 00:48:38.600
<v Speaker 7>lot of shit for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the day after that,</v>

972
00:48:38.601 --> 00:48:41.540
<v Speaker 7>then he posts his photo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the funny thing.</v>

973
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:42.423
<v Speaker 7>I have instagram and the caption.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This represents good and America </v>

974
00:48:45.861 --> 00:48:46.694
<v Speaker 7>becoming whole again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We will no longer outsource to other </v>

975
00:48:48.081 --> 00:48:48.914
<v Speaker 7>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We build factories here in America and </v>

976
00:48:50.271 --> 00:48:51.104
<v Speaker 7>create jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It will provide jobs for all who are </v>

977
00:48:52.521 --> 00:48:56.360
<v Speaker 7>free from prisons as we abolished the </v>
<v Speaker 7>13th amendment message sent with love.</v>

978
00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:00.740
<v Speaker 7>I'm not sure the trumps anything about </v>
<v Speaker 7>bringing people from prison.</v>

979
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:02.383
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's,</v>

980
00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.820
<v Speaker 7>and then this kind of in some trouble </v>
<v Speaker 7>because yeah,</v>

981
00:49:04.821 --> 00:49:05.690
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is,</v>

982
00:49:05.691 --> 00:49:09.260
<v Speaker 7>this is less about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is more political.</v>

983
00:49:09.261 --> 00:49:11.630
<v Speaker 7>This is like I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I support Donald Trump.</v>

984
00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:14.390
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then the,</v>

985
00:49:14.391 --> 00:49:17.210
<v Speaker 7>he said abolished the 13th amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is the one that,</v>

986
00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.790
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the whole sentence slavery.</v>

987
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:22.430
<v Speaker 7>But then there's like a section of that </v>
<v Speaker 7>that says,</v>

988
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:25.850
<v Speaker 7>except for p praise resins.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he later said,</v>

989
00:49:25.851 --> 00:49:27.050
<v Speaker 7>I meant the word amended.</v>

990
00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

991
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.340
<v Speaker 3>you got to clarify that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

992
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.503
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to know that doesn't come off </v>

993
00:49:32.861 --> 00:49:35.530
<v Speaker 3>good with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With a maggot hat.</v>

994
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:40.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think he's still trying to be like</v>

995
00:49:40.151 --> 00:49:41.980
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm reaching across.</v>

996
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:43.663
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have pointed out that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Migraine hat has a label that </v>

997
00:49:46.121 --> 00:49:48.760
<v Speaker 3>says made in China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like,</v>

998
00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:51.170
<v Speaker 3>if you want to start the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

999
00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:52.053
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this great clip of when Donald </v>

1000
00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 3>was running for the Republican nominee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went on Jimmy Kimmel.</v>

1001
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:03.250
<v Speaker 3>It was so great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And camel had a bunch of trump ties with</v>

1002
00:50:03.251 --> 00:50:04.780
<v Speaker 3>the label made in China,</v>

1003
00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:07.183
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:11.010
<v Speaker 7>So then the response to this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's a couple reacts reactions.</v>

1005
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:12.590
<v Speaker 7>Evans,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Captain America,</v>

1006
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:14.630
<v Speaker 7>Captain America.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm with a lot of life.</v>

1007
00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.020
<v Speaker 7>He jumped in 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>lights.</v>

1008
00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.450
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1009
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:20.030
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's response,</v>

1010
00:50:20.031 --> 00:50:20.864
<v Speaker 7>there's nothing more maddening than </v>
<v Speaker 7>debating someone who doesn't know </v>

1011
00:50:22.701 --> 00:50:23.534
<v Speaker 7>history.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't read books and frames or </v>

1012
00:50:25.311 --> 00:50:28.880
<v Speaker 7>Myopia is virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The level of conjecture I've encountered</v>

1013
00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:32.780
<v Speaker 7>lately isn't just frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's retrogressive unprecedented.</v>

<v Speaker 7>He,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he got the webster's out.</v>

1020
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:44.203
<v Speaker 1>He fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was straight up cause sponsored by </v>

1021
00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:50.120
<v Speaker 1>thesaurus.com.</v>

<v Speaker 1>people slammed that.</v>

1025
00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:57.403

<v Speaker 7>And then Lana Delray commented this one </v>

1026
00:50:59.841 --> 00:51:04.841
<v Speaker 7>had like right under his photo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This one had like 30,000</v>

1027

<v Speaker 1>record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1029
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.153
<v Speaker 1>I'm not supporting in favor of Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump and in fact I want to say he </v>

1030
00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:15.350
<v Speaker 1>definitely made it to political at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1031
00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like that one.</v>

1032
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:18.920
<v Speaker 1>He cause then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1033
00:51:18.921 --> 00:51:19.880
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1034
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.050

<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1035
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.453
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the gesture of healing the </v>

1036
00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:25.514
<v Speaker 1>divide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he made a political and using </v>

1037
00:51:28.281 --> 00:51:29.114
<v Speaker 1>these talking points and I so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the backlash at that point </v>

1038
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:36.330
<v Speaker 1>should have kept it pure about just </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to stick to walk point.</v>

1039
00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>just dropped.</v>

1047
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I can or you can't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can believe that.</v>

1048
00:52:05.641 --> 00:52:06.474
<v Speaker 1>That there's nothing more maddening than</v>
<v Speaker 1>debating someone who doesn't know </v>

1049
00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:10.394
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't read books and frames their </v>

1050
00:52:11.931 --> 00:52:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Myopia as virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the level,</v>

1051
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.800
<v Speaker 1>unapologetic conjecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

1052
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Just say what you mean like you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you writing a essay on twitter?</v>

1053
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:28.310
<v Speaker 1>The level of unapologetic conjecture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accountability isn't just frustrating.</v>

1054
00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:32.510
<v Speaker 1>It's retrogressive unprecedented and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Apps Shit,</v>

1055
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.300
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1056
00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:37.070
<v Speaker 1>when you're gonna to like criticize it </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanya for not being educated,</v>

1057
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:40.370
<v Speaker 1>then you come up with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dare you to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1060
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:51.290
<v Speaker 1>You don't like what the guy says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think he's on the educated and uh,</v>

1061
00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:52.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:57.710
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he definitely went a little overboard.</v>

1063
00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:58.573
<v Speaker 7>And then Lana del Rey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>trump becoming our president was a loss </v>

1064
00:53:00.351 --> 00:53:01.184
<v Speaker 7>for the country,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you were support of him is a loss </v>

1065
00:53:02.361 --> 00:53:04.340
<v Speaker 7>for the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1066
00:53:04.341 --> 00:53:06.920
<v Speaker 7>I can only assume you were late to his </v>
<v Speaker 7>personality on some level.</v>

1067
00:53:06.921 --> 00:53:10.190
<v Speaker 7>Delusions of grandeur,</v>
<v Speaker 7>extreme issues with narcissism.</v>

1068
00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:11.293
<v Speaker 7>None of which would be a talking point </v>
<v Speaker 7>if we weren't speaking about the man </v>

1069
00:53:13.191 --> 00:53:14.024
<v Speaker 7>leading our country.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you think it's all right to support </v>

1070
00:53:16.161 --> 00:53:16.994
<v Speaker 7>someone who believes it's okay to grab a</v>
<v Speaker 7>woman by the pussy just because he's </v>

1071
00:53:19.071 --> 00:53:20.810
<v Speaker 7>famous,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then you need an intervention.</v>

1072
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:21.644
<v Speaker 7>As much as he does something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so many narcissists we'll never get </v>

1073
00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 7>because there just isn't help for the </v>
<v Speaker 7>issue.</v>

1074
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.890
<v Speaker 7>Message sent with concern that we'll </v>
<v Speaker 7>never be addressed.</v>

1075
00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.180
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's real beef.</v>

1076
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:34.050
<v Speaker 7>That's beef.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She performed at his wedding.</v>

1077
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.110
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1078
00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.140
<v Speaker 1>so tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel about,</v>

1079
00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:42.040
<v Speaker 1>because about what Kanye said as a fan </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a student of his,</v>

1080
00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:43.813
<v Speaker 7>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that he's going about it the </v>

1081
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:49.610
<v Speaker 7>completely wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1082
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:54.620
<v Speaker 7>And I see,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I see what he's trying to do and I'm not</v>

1083
00:53:54.621 --> 00:53:55.880
<v Speaker 7>going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1084
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:57.043
<v Speaker 7>I think people aren't shocked because I </v>
<v Speaker 7>was looking up like what celebrities </v>

1085
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:04.720
<v Speaker 7>actually endorsed trump.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's a real row of character,</v>

1086
00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.720
<v Speaker 1>not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the best.</v>

1087
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:09.573
<v Speaker 7>Like far and away the most relevant </v>
<v Speaker 7>entertainer to everyone was the other </v>

1089
00:54:14.471 --> 00:54:16.350
<v Speaker 7>one roach.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Neat loaf and shit like that.</v>

1090
00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.240
<v Speaker 7>It's like meatloaf.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The first one was Roseanne.</v>

1091
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:21.670
<v Speaker 7>That was the first one that popped up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1092
00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:22.683
<v Speaker 7>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One Sec.</v>

1093
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:29.280
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And like I'm whole Cogan you know,</v>

1094
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:30.183
<v Speaker 7>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think people can't believe that </v>

1095
00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:33.903
<v Speaker 7>because no one else has even getting </v>
<v Speaker 7>close to that conversation who was </v>

1096
00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:38.883
<v Speaker 7>popular and so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then the last one was from </v>

1097
00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.550
<v Speaker 7>questlove.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He said,</v>

1098
00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:45.580
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we aren't even typing his name.</v>

1099
00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:47.470
<v Speaker 7>I find it strange.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's and trending get,</v>

1100
00:54:47.471 --> 00:54:50.800
<v Speaker 7>we're all typing the same thing for all </v>
<v Speaker 7>that he's canceled talk.</v>

1101
00:54:50.801 --> 00:54:52.900
<v Speaker 7>There was an ounce of hope in our souls </v>
<v Speaker 7>tonight,</v>

1102
00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:54.820
<v Speaker 7>but all we got was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1103
00:54:54.821 --> 00:54:58.000
<v Speaker 7>I'm kind of sad man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was about the snl performance.</v>

1104
00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:03.580
<v Speaker 7>So all three of those guys jumped in and</v>
<v Speaker 7>then snoop,</v>

1105
00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:06.430
<v Speaker 7>snoop,</v>
<v Speaker 7>snoop went in for the kill.</v>

1106
00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:09.520
<v Speaker 7>This guy named Dj Pooh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1107
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:12.970
<v Speaker 7>re posted the photo and said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Magda music ain't getting attention.</v>

1108
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.420
<v Speaker 7>So he's saying he's kind of Promo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

1109
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:19.270
<v Speaker 7>And then snoop and the comments make </v>
<v Speaker 7>your music again.</v>

1110
00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:22.050
<v Speaker 7>Bleep and word.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1111
00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:25.090
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1112
00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:28.510
<v Speaker 7>With an a at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then he called him uncle Tom.</v>

1113
00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncle Tom.</v>

1114
00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who don't know,</v>

1115
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.150
<v Speaker 1>cause he didn't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a book,</v>

1116
00:55:35.151 --> 00:55:36.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1117
00:55:36.411 --> 00:55:38.900
<v Speaker 1>but a fictional character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was called a uncle Tom's cabin.</v>

1118
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uncle Tom's cabin.</v>

1119
00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:45.170
<v Speaker 1>A black man that owned slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's betraying his own kind,</v>

1120
00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.750
<v Speaker 1>in other words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1121
00:55:47.751 --> 00:55:48.880
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that</v>

1122
00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:52.330
<v Speaker 7>and he was a earlier posts from him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck?</v>

1123
00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:54.760
<v Speaker 7>This was from one connie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>First put the hat on,</v>

1124
00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.720
<v Speaker 7>he said the new Kanye,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well all white now way to go,</v>

1125
00:55:58.721 --> 00:56:00.960
<v Speaker 7>dude edited him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1126
00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:07.320
<v Speaker 7>so he used to be mad at Connie for </v>
<v Speaker 7>awhile after this one on the left.</v>

1127
00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:08.853
<v Speaker 7>Then Connie went out and wore a picture </v>
<v Speaker 7>of snoop dogg on his shirt and then </v>

1128
00:56:13.331 --> 00:56:16.960
<v Speaker 7>immediately snoop dogg posted it and </v>
<v Speaker 7>said forgiveness is everything.</v>

1129
00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.020
<v Speaker 7>So he won him over.</v>

1130
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:22.870
<v Speaker 1>He's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>

1131
00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:23.830
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1132
00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Of,</v>

1133
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 7>and then I look how good was like you </v>
<v Speaker 7>uncle Tom,</v>

1134
00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:29.650
<v Speaker 7>which is kind of like the worst thing </v>
<v Speaker 7>you could say to it.</v>

1135
00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:30.960
<v Speaker 7>Another block.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's,</v>

1136
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:32.740
<v Speaker 7>that sounds a lot of hay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1137
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:36.970
<v Speaker 7>And then he just wears the shirt while </v>
<v Speaker 7>still having them.</v>

1138
00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.520
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I,</v>

1139
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:39.790
<v Speaker 7>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's great.</v>

1140
00:56:39.791 --> 00:56:40.840
<v Speaker 7>That's what he's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1141
00:56:40.841 --> 00:56:41.674
<v Speaker 7>he's trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I think Kanye beautifully disarmed </v>

1142
00:56:43.881 --> 00:56:45.730
<v Speaker 7>that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.410
<v Speaker 7>And it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:56:47.411 --> 00:56:49.630
<v Speaker 7>It worked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I was like,</v>

1145
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.140
<v Speaker 7>so who's forgiving who in that scenario?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

1146
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.710
<v Speaker 7>Snoop,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess didn't,</v>

1147
00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:59.050
<v Speaker 7>was forgiving Kanye because he wore the </v>
<v Speaker 7>acknowledged him,</v>

1148
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:00.880
<v Speaker 7>cause that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1149
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:02.640
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to have to use that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who am I wrong?</v>

1150
00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:05.290
<v Speaker 7>I got to start wearing this shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the move.</v>

1151
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.820
<v Speaker 7>That's the move for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:10.660
<v Speaker 7>And then trump tweeted after the s and l</v>
<v Speaker 7>performance,</v>

1153
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:14.500
<v Speaker 7>like many,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of course you have a trump.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>nobody wants that.</v>

1159
00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.160
<v Speaker 7>Like many,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't watch Saturday night live.</v>

1160
00:57:27.161 --> 00:57:28.870
<v Speaker 7>You have a trump?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

<v Speaker 7>hosted it.</v>

1168
00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:40.450
<v Speaker 7>No longer funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No talent or charm.</v>

1169
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:41.843
<v Speaker 7>It is just a political ad for the dems </v>
<v Speaker 7>word is that Kanye west who put on a </v>

1170
00:57:45.321 --> 00:57:48.820

<v Speaker 7>He's leading the charge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Very cool.</v>

<v Speaker 7>but why,</v>

1174
00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:01.120
<v Speaker 7>why is he doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why is he,</v>

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:03.730
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>taking his legacy like this?</v>

1176
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:06.100
<v Speaker 7>Did you make this fun?</v>

1177
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:06.900
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1178
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:08.890
<v Speaker 7>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a good,</v>

1179
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:10.980
<v Speaker 7>good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1180
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.823
<v Speaker 7>so you got to go back to 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This isn't the first time he's done </v>

1181
00:58:16.841 --> 00:58:19.270
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people kind of forgot.</v>

1182
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:21.063
<v Speaker 7>He put out his album yeezus and June of </v>
<v Speaker 7>2013 and then he put out all of the </v>

1183
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:30.961
<v Speaker 7>merge and all of the merge was covered </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the confederate flag.</v>

1184
00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:32.980
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's pretty racy.</v>

1185
00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:35.020
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Literally.</v>

1186
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.610
<v Speaker 7>And so that was a huge thing at the </v>
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

1187
00:58:39.611 --> 00:58:44.611
<v Speaker 7>Then I didn't see that everything we </v>
<v Speaker 7>were falling client so close.</v>

1188
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:46.270
<v Speaker 7>They look like a midget.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1189
00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:48.190
<v Speaker 7>kind of like until we met.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:50.620
<v Speaker 7>I'm not supposed to be a midget and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>guess I ain't either.</v>

1191
00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:53.680
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So a bunch of the merge had,</v>

1192
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:54.543
<v Speaker 7>a lot of people were upset and here's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>clip of him in 2013 explaining why he </v>

1193
00:58:59.291 --> 00:59:02.050
<v Speaker 7>wore,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why he wore the confederate flag,</v>

1194
00:59:02.051 --> 00:59:02.884
<v Speaker 7>merge</v>

1195
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.460
<v Speaker 9>the tour,</v>
<v Speaker 9>merge she I Red Eye,</v>

1196
00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:07.380
<v Speaker 9>which I thought was kind of like the </v>
<v Speaker 9>people.</v>

1197
00:59:07.381 --> 00:59:09.360
<v Speaker 9>I thought people just want to find </v>
<v Speaker 9>something to get.</v>

1198
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.980
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1199
00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:11.580
<v Speaker 9>I just want to get all riled up about </v>
<v Speaker 9>something.</v>

1200
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:12.713
<v Speaker 9>But it was about the tour merchant,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the confederate flags in the skeleton </v>

1201
00:59:14.761 --> 00:59:16.590
<v Speaker 9>imagery and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

1202
00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.420
<v Speaker 9>do you think people are overreacting </v>
<v Speaker 9>with this?</v>

1203
00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.590
<v Speaker 9>React how you want?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I got said it's making react,</v>

1204
00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:22.310
<v Speaker 9>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

1205
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:23.900
<v Speaker 3>Energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got as good energy.</v>

1206
00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the confederate flag represented slavery</v>

1207
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.190
<v Speaker 3>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way my mom's shot,</v>

1208
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 3>that's about abstract take on what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know about it.</v>

1209
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I made the song new slaves,</v>

1210
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.580
<v Speaker 3>so I took the confederate flag and made </v>
<v Speaker 3>it my flat.</v>

1211
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:39.380
<v Speaker 3>It's my flag now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now just go and do.</v>

1212
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:40.663
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

1213
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:43.470
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's great.</v>

1214
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.330
<v Speaker 7>That's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's beautiful.</v>

1215
00:59:45.331 --> 00:59:46.164
<v Speaker 7>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then just this was the day before </v>

1216
00:59:48.691 --> 00:59:52.170
<v Speaker 7>the snl performance,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or he was explaining the maggot hat.</v>

1217
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:56.700
<v Speaker 10>I redesigned it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I've been changed the Brim,</v>

1218
00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:58.913
<v Speaker 10>change the shape right here,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and I'll put positive energy into the </v>

1219
01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.064
<v Speaker 10>hat.</v>

1220
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:04.320
<v Speaker 7>That's what he said about it there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1221
01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.220
<v Speaker 7>But he fucked it up when he started </v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about political point.</v>

1222
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:08.623
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's definitely where it's getting </v>

1223
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:11.130
<v Speaker 7>fucked that up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1224
01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:16.420
<v Speaker 7>I think he started with this idea and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then a bunch of sort of a right.</v>

1225
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:20.960
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm right leaning.</v>

1226
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:23.330
<v Speaker 7>People in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in media started reaching out to him and</v>

1227
01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:27.350
<v Speaker 7>he started taking meetings with them and</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think then they got in his brain,</v>

1228
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.960
<v Speaker 7>he got some,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1229
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.320
<v Speaker 7>he got some talking points from them and</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1230
01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.830
<v Speaker 7>see,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there you go.</v>

1231
01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:35.420
<v Speaker 7>He's becoming what he hates.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kind of.</v>

1232
01:00:35.421 --> 01:00:39.410
<v Speaker 7>Isn't it true?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that he really,</v>

1233
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.410
<v Speaker 7>I don't think there's any maliciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1234
01:00:42.411 --> 01:00:43.730
<v Speaker 7>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he'd be coming,</v>

1235
01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.850
<v Speaker 7>but he's almost upon to the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1236
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:48.260
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever,</v>

1237
01:00:48.261 --> 01:00:49.910
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of like,</v>

1238
01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:50.744
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pulling whispering in his ear and he's </v>

1239
01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:52.874
<v Speaker 7>coming out.</v>

1240
01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.150
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Talking about the,</v>

1241
01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.240
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>bringing jobs back or whatever.</v>

1242
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.030
<v Speaker 7>Not that that's a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it is a talking point.</v>

1243
01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.790
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I haven't done enough research on </v>

1265
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:10.934
<v Speaker 7>conservatives to call myself or be </v>
<v Speaker 7>called one on just refusing to be </v>

1266
01:02:13.071 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 7>enslaved by monolithic thought.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And all right.</v>

1269
01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.750
<v Speaker 7>the hat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not about policies.</v>

1270
01:02:21.751 --> 01:02:22.584
<v Speaker 7>I'm not a politician like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It represents overcoming fear and doing </v>

1271
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:26.370
<v Speaker 7>what you felt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No matter what anyone said,</v>

<v Speaker 7>you can't bully me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Liberals can't bully me.</v>

1273
01:02:28.981 --> 01:02:31.350
<v Speaker 7>News can't bully me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The hip hop community can't believe me.</v>

1275
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:34.524
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we would talk about policies and he </v>

1276
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:38.790
<v Speaker 7>doesn't agree with the policies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He likes his personality and how he made</v>

1277
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:42.640
<v Speaker 7>it to be president when everyone really </v>
<v Speaker 7>underestimated him essentially.</v>

1278
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:44.310
<v Speaker 7>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then the next,</v>

1279
01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.360
<v Speaker 7>the dragon energy.</v>

1280
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:48.660
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And here's one of his good friends after</v>

1281
01:02:48.661 --> 01:02:50.040
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>after the performance,</v>

1282
01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:52.650
<v Speaker 7>he has never said he agrees with trump's</v>
<v Speaker 7>policies.</v>

1283
01:02:52.651 --> 01:02:55.410
<v Speaker 7>Just the fact that no one would have </v>
<v Speaker 7>thought trump would be president,</v>

1284
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:57.720
<v Speaker 7>meaning he did the emba.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Unbelievable.</v>

1285
01:02:57.721 --> 01:02:58.554
<v Speaker 7>And that's the connection.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Only him wearing the hat is his choice </v>

1286
01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:02.160
<v Speaker 7>and he feels he's stripping the power of</v>
<v Speaker 7>hate.</v>

1287
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.480
<v Speaker 7>That people give that hat by wearing it </v>
<v Speaker 7>and wants to love all no matter how they</v>

1288
01:03:06.481 --> 01:03:09.930
<v Speaker 7>speak of him or whatever we don't agree </v>
<v Speaker 7>with because that's how God works.</v>

1289
01:03:09.931 --> 01:03:10.764
<v Speaker 7>God loves all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If he was trying to strip the power of </v>

1290
01:03:14.361 --> 01:03:16.400
<v Speaker 7>hate that people give it by wearing it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he would.</v>

1291
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:19.640
<v Speaker 7>He's never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1292
01:03:19.641 --> 01:03:22.220
<v Speaker 7>not well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said he put like positive energy into</v>

1293
01:03:22.221 --> 01:03:25.340
<v Speaker 7>the hat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but what does that,</v>

1294
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.280
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it means it's like diamond water.</v>

1295
01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.410
<v Speaker 7>They run it through and he liked it when</v>
<v Speaker 7>asked about the core energy.</v>

1296
01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.040
<v Speaker 7>And he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He washed it and dining and water.</v>

1297
01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.900
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to ask you about the </v>
<v Speaker 7>confederate flag.</v>

1298
01:03:35.901 --> 01:03:38.390
<v Speaker 7>He gave it very straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 7>explanation.</v>

1299
01:03:38.391 --> 01:03:41.900
<v Speaker 7>He said this is represents slavery and </v>
<v Speaker 7>now it's mine.</v>

1300
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:43.220
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1301
01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:45.980
<v Speaker 7>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1302
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:47.150
<v Speaker 7>God bless.</v>
<v Speaker 7>God loves all.</v>

1303
01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.133
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then here's a quick clip he was </v>

1304
01:03:49.851 --> 01:03:54.650
<v Speaker 7>asked about if you liked why he is </v>
<v Speaker 7>showing support for trump.</v>

1305
01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:55.933
<v Speaker 7>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where'd it go?</v>

1306
01:03:58.610 --> 01:03:59.443
<v Speaker 7>There we go.</v>

1307
01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:01.710
<v Speaker 3>So maybe that's what you liked the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1308
01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1309
01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.390
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump with the idea of an outside</v>
<v Speaker 3>of infiltrating.</v>

1310
01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>

1311
01:04:09.281 --> 01:04:10.114
<v Speaker 3>It showed you that anything is possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows you that it doesn't even like </v>

1312
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Virgil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1313
01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:20.110
<v Speaker 3>working at Louis Vuitton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump being in office,</v>

1314
01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:23.050
<v Speaker 3>it's a time for the unconventional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1315
01:04:23.051 --> 01:04:25.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a traditional thinker.</v>

1316
01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm a non conformist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1317
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.090
<v Speaker 3>So that relates to the nonconformists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pardon me now,</v>

1318
01:04:31.091 --> 01:04:32.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also,</v>

1319
01:04:32.951 --> 01:04:34.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm a producer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to segue things.</v>

1320
01:04:34.751 --> 01:04:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to take Otis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chop it up,</v>

1321
01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.170
<v Speaker 3>do it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1322
01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:39.310
<v Speaker 3>so what's the gay version?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the gay version of b,</v>

1323
01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:43.930
<v Speaker 3>the trump campaign and maybe to Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sanders principles.</v>

1324
01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:48.160
<v Speaker 3>That would be my mics and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think both had,</v>

1325
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:49.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1326
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need it.</v>

1327
01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.650
<v Speaker 7>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there you go.</v>

1328
01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:59.710
<v Speaker 7>So I don't know where he is with his </v>
<v Speaker 7>thoughts on politics.</v>

1329
01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.920
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>bye.</v>

1330
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:04.330
<v Speaker 7>Are you though?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So really the question was like,</v>

1331
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:05.283
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can you turn this into something </v>

1332
01:05:07.931 --> 01:05:08.840
<v Speaker 7>positive?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

1333
01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:12.760
<v Speaker 7>I don't personally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think so.</v>

1334
01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:16.480
<v Speaker 7>And you liked them to charged like the </v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1335
01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:17.733
<v Speaker 7>you can't in a way like it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 7>just say I just like trump because he </v>

1336
01:05:21.701 --> 01:05:22.534
<v Speaker 7>made it against all odds without </v>
<v Speaker 7>acknowledging everything that he stands </v>

1337
01:05:26.861 --> 01:05:27.694
<v Speaker 7>for.</v>

1338
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:29.463
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also recall him saying that he has he </v>

1339
01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:33.480
<v Speaker 4>redesigned the hat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1340
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.840
<v Speaker 4>he has a yeezy version of the make </v>
<v Speaker 4>America great again hat that he wears.</v>

1341
01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's fantastic that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>made his own hat</v>

1342
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:41.520
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1343
01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:43.580
<v Speaker 7>he changed the Brim,</v>
<v Speaker 7>changed the thing.</v>

1344
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't look better.</v>

1345
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:46.060
<v Speaker 4>I have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks,</v>

1346
01:05:46.061 --> 01:05:48.910
<v Speaker 4>he looks a little goofy when he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hat fit.</v>

1347
01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:51.100
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you recall the picture on Instagram,</v>

1348
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.060
<v Speaker 4>that's like a total goof angle while at </v>
<v Speaker 4>any rate,</v>

1349
01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 4>Kanye,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's out there,</v>

1350
01:05:56.231 --> 01:05:57.940
<v Speaker 4>he's doing his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's authentic.</v>

1351
01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.090
<v Speaker 4>And you as a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you love him.</v>

1352
01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.130
<v Speaker 4>You against all odds forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>

1353
01:06:04.131 --> 01:06:06.250
<v Speaker 4>what if you could say anything to Konya </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>

1354
01:06:06.251 --> 01:06:07.780
<v Speaker 4>what would you tell him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kanya is right here.</v>

1355
01:06:07.781 --> 01:06:08.614
<v Speaker 4>What do you say?</v>

1356
01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:14.960
<v Speaker 7>I'd probably say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well first I think that um,</v>

1357
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.310
<v Speaker 7>I appreciate what he's trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1358
01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:20.060
<v Speaker 7>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

1359
01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:20.893
<v Speaker 7>it's like a sisyphus task.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's like rolling a boulder to Chris </v>

1360
01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:25.340
<v Speaker 7>Evans.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1361
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:28.280
<v Speaker 7>the source out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1362
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:31.160
<v Speaker 7>it's like an,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I saw some people going well,</v>

1363
01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:31.551
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1364
01:06:31.551 --> 01:06:32.384
<v Speaker 7>like the swastika used to be a symbol of</v>
<v Speaker 7>peace and then they changed it to make </v>

1365
01:06:35.541 --> 01:06:37.150
<v Speaker 7>it a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But it's not,</v>

1366
01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.550
<v Speaker 7>once that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't bring it back.</v>

1367
01:06:40.551 --> 01:06:43.550
<v Speaker 7>You can't take the Hitler mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said it's like,</v>

1368
01:06:43.551 --> 01:06:46.250
<v Speaker 7>it's easier to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to poison the,</v>

1369
01:06:46.251 --> 01:06:51.251
<v Speaker 7>well then to like purify the water.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's my thinking and trust.</v>

1370
01:06:53.931 --> 01:06:58.640
<v Speaker 7>If he wants to use the hat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think he has to design,</v>

1371
01:06:58.700 --> 01:06:59.533
<v Speaker 7>redesign it a little further and stay </v>
<v Speaker 7>out of the political talking points he </v>

1372
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:06.600
<v Speaker 7>was saying is trying to remix.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1373
01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.590
<v Speaker 7>This ID as Buddy Dan change that had </v>
<v Speaker 7>enough.</v>

1374
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:13.280
<v Speaker 7>My pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've got a pitch.</v>

1375
01:07:13.281 --> 01:07:16.730
<v Speaker 7>This isn't the redesign one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you've got,</v>

1376
01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:17.963
<v Speaker 7>you know the Democrats typically blue </v>
<v Speaker 7>publicans or read the trump has is very </v>

1377
01:07:23.541 --> 01:07:27.080
<v Speaker 7>red,</v>
<v Speaker 7>blue and red combined purple.</v>

1378
01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:30.350
<v Speaker 4>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Purple Make America great again.</v>

1379
01:07:30.351 --> 01:07:32.170
<v Speaker 4>That's a brilliant idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1380
01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:32.270
<v Speaker 4>You</v>

<v Speaker 7>I looked it up.</v>

1385
01:07:42.021 --> 01:07:45.200
<v Speaker 7>I went to the meanings of colors and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>was ah,</v>

1386
01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.641
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>

1387
01:07:46.641 --> 01:07:48.110

<v Speaker 7>the color of spirituality to energy of </v>

1390
01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:53.444
<v Speaker 7>red with the calm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who defines who decides what color </v>

1391
01:07:55.581 --> 01:07:56.414
<v Speaker 7>means?</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of these are marketing companies </v>

1392
01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:59.980
<v Speaker 7>as color plays very heavily.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1393
01:07:59.981 --> 01:08:01.390
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is like got it.</v>

1394
01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:02.283
<v Speaker 7>A,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a color that inspires reflection and </v>

1395
01:08:03.771 --> 01:08:06.140
<v Speaker 7>self awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It just the color of the sensitive,</v>

1396
01:08:06.141 --> 01:08:08.390
<v Speaker 7>compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>intuitive soul.</v>

1397
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:10.483
<v Speaker 7>Violet has long been associated with </v>
<v Speaker 7>royalty and characteristics of quality </v>

1398
01:08:13.851 --> 01:08:15.160
<v Speaker 7>and luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mom,</v>

1399
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:20.260
<v Speaker 7>if you go back to his album,</v>
<v Speaker 7>cover the sticker on it was violent.</v>

1400
01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:22.670
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You think he's onto this already?</v>

1401
01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:25.070
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm trying to leave Kanye.</v>

1402
01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.113
<v Speaker 7>Well I think you've got to keep the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>make America great again cause then you </v>

1403
01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:34.430
<v Speaker 7>have both colors the same meaning if you</v>
<v Speaker 7>go away from the phrase,</v>

1404
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.100
<v Speaker 7>it becomes something to different.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Combine them.</v>

1405
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:42.490
<v Speaker 7>Kanye who is listening for sure </v>
<v Speaker 7>obviously listened to end.</v>

1406
01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.830
<v Speaker 7>He's got great advice I think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or the slogan.</v>

1407
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 7>I think you could slight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it could go both ways,</v>

1408
01:08:48.681 --> 01:08:50.840
<v Speaker 7>but I think the color would be a good </v>
<v Speaker 7>change.</v>

1409
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.290
<v Speaker 7>Maybe make America great cause it was </v>
<v Speaker 7>not,</v>

<v Speaker 12>music companies,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the whole thing,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Now.</v>

1590
01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:42.510
<v Speaker 9>What about Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

1591
01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.393
<v Speaker 9>Josh satirize actually just wrapped up </v>
<v Speaker 9>his testimony and we aren't getting on </v>

1592
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:48.900
<v Speaker 9>his and his team to exit from the </v>
<v Speaker 9>courthouse.</v>

1593
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:53.430
<v Speaker 9>This is one of two lawsuits that he's </v>
<v Speaker 9>filed against the company.</v>

1594
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:54.743
<v Speaker 9>I hear he is just coming out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're going to get any comments from </v>

1595
01:17:56.881 --> 01:17:57.714
<v Speaker 9>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 9>It has 17 different categories of </v>

1596
01:18:00.331 --> 01:18:03.450
<v Speaker 9>documents that are related to his ouster</v>
<v Speaker 9>as chairman of the board today,</v>

1597
01:18:03.451 --> 01:18:04.284
<v Speaker 9>he really appeared calm and reserved.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's in stark contrast to public </v>

1598
01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:11.040
<v Speaker 9>comments that he's made and also </v>
<v Speaker 9>statements he's put out on his website.</v>

1599
01:18:11.041 --> 01:18:11.874
<v Speaker 9>Save Papa John's dot com it feels the </v>
<v Speaker 9>company didn't properly protect him as </v>

1600
01:18:15.601 --> 01:18:16.434
<v Speaker 9>founder.</v>
<v Speaker 9>After a Forbes reports that he'd used a </v>

1601
01:18:18.181 --> 01:18:19.014
<v Speaker 9>racial slur on a conference call.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was about a kind of using it as a </v>

1602
01:18:23.641 --> 01:18:27.480
<v Speaker 9>racial epithet reports in the media </v>
<v Speaker 9>mischaracterize what actually happened.</v>

1603
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:30.210
<v Speaker 9>Mr [inaudible] today also spoke of an </v>
<v Speaker 9>intuition,</v>

1604
01:18:30.211 --> 01:18:31.830
<v Speaker 9>a sixth sense,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a gut feeling.</v>

1605
01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:32.843
<v Speaker 9>It's something may have been going on </v>
<v Speaker 9>with the company and that's why he's </v>

1606
01:18:35.761 --> 01:18:40.650
<v Speaker 9>trying to seek documents that go back to</v>
<v Speaker 9>October 31st he made those.</v>

1607
01:18:40.651 --> 01:18:44.100
<v Speaker 9>Now Ms comments,</v>
<v Speaker 9>nfl and leadership,</v>

1608
01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:47.400
<v Speaker 9>so he doesn't know if the board's </v>
<v Speaker 9>actions and mount to a coup,</v>

1609
01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:51.150
<v Speaker 9>a conspiracy or perhaps they are acting </v>
<v Speaker 9>in the best interest of the company that</v>

1610
01:18:51.151 --> 01:18:51.984
<v Speaker 9>you want to obtain these documents to </v>
<v Speaker 9>try and figure out really what happened </v>

1611
01:18:54.661 --> 01:18:55.494
<v Speaker 9>here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I also spoke to a source close to the </v>

1612
01:18:56.851 --> 01:18:57.684
<v Speaker 9>company but at the Johns seemed a bit </v>
<v Speaker 9>confused today about what documents he </v>

1613
01:19:00.391 --> 01:19:01.224
<v Speaker 9>was asking for.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That is troubling because he is a </v>

1614
01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:03.930
<v Speaker 9>direct,</v>
<v Speaker 9>just want the,</v>

1615
01:19:03.931 --> 01:19:08.130
<v Speaker 9>I just want the mirror narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 9>clear about what he actually needed.</v>

1616
01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:11.430
<v Speaker 9>Having that the company really looks </v>
<v Speaker 9>forward to moving past these schemas and</v>

1617
01:19:11.431 --> 01:19:14.640
<v Speaker 9>creating a better papa John's a better </v>
<v Speaker 9>culture for the company.</v>

1618
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.133
<v Speaker 9>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we should mention that because we are </v>

1619
01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:17.334
<v Speaker 9>struggling to meet away from a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was unclear today if the judge from </v>

1620
01:19:21.121 --> 01:19:24.690
<v Speaker 9>the bench,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but by showing again,</v>

1621
01:19:24.691 --> 01:19:26.400
<v Speaker 9>we're waiting comments from a John</v>

01:24:21.701 --> 01:24:22.534
<v Speaker 1>court filing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shatner has denied the allegations and </v>

01:24:25.481 --> 01:24:26.314
<v Speaker 1>as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>papa is and will ever for be in the </v>

1696
01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:37.654
<v Speaker 1>papa because he went to seek documents </v>

<v Speaker 1>cruise and everybody was trapped on this</v>

1737
01:27:06.571 --> 01:27:10.130
<v Speaker 1>cruise and it was so bad that Royal </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caribbean's had,</v>

1738
01:27:10.690 --> 01:27:15.020
<v Speaker 1>they're very fond everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's just hilarious footage of,</v>

1739
01:27:15.021 --> 01:27:18.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all this.</v>

1740
01:27:18.231 --> 01:27:19.064
<v Speaker 1>And it was like a 24 hour nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Saas Jillian station made this </v>

1741
01:27:22.461 --> 01:27:24.200
<v Speaker 1>really hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like scoop,</v>

1742
01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:27.060
<v Speaker 1>very serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1743
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:30.800
<v Speaker 1>they were very serious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1744
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.980
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just was loving this whole thing.</v>

1745
01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Cruise ruined by 1300 men on a work </v>
<v Speaker 1>bender.</v>

1746
01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.553
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

1747
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:43.190
<v Speaker 13>It was supposed to be the cruise of a </v>
<v Speaker 13>lifetime.</v>

1748
01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:44.024
<v Speaker 13>But these excited ozzy families for them</v>
<v Speaker 13>soon got a sick feeling when they </v>

1749
01:27:47.541 --> 01:27:52.520
<v Speaker 13>realized they were sharing the ship with</v>
<v Speaker 13>1300 men on a work bender,</v>

1750
01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:53.520
<v Speaker 13>our work</v>

1751
01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:57.690
<v Speaker 12>Banda,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they turned</v>

1752
01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.570
<v Speaker 1>family cruise until like they set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a strip club.</v>

1753
01:28:02.170 --> 01:28:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe this shit.</v>

1754
01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:03.993
<v Speaker 1>These guys are the best and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>just out there with their phones out on </v>

1755
01:28:08.061 --> 01:28:08.950
<v Speaker 1>shit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1756
01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:10.653
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it that a company was able to </v>

1757
01:28:14.801 --> 01:28:19.801
<v Speaker 1>just ruin a whole crew's paper like </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatized.</v>

1758
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:21.490
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1759
01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:22.953
<v Speaker 13>randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Like they kept their doors open and you </v>

1760
01:28:24.731 --> 01:28:27.030
<v Speaker 13>were just walking by and not knowing </v>
<v Speaker 13>where you're going to see.</v>

1761
01:28:27.090 --> 01:28:27.630
<v Speaker 13>Yup.</v>

1762
01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Some fucking naked Indian too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing though.</v>

1763
01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:31.913
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

1764
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:35.010
<v Speaker 12>Sorry.</v>

1765
01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:36.870
<v Speaker 1>They're in the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dominating everything.</v>

1766
01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:40.480
<v Speaker 12>It was luck as the chain.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Hundred Bucks.</v>

1767
01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:41.543
<v Speaker 12>Not Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They would just papers everywhere when </v>

1768
01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:49.830
<v Speaker 12>we didn't get our sail away party and it</v>
<v Speaker 12>was taken over by them.</v>

1769
01:28:49.890 --> 01:28:50.880
<v Speaker 12>That was the beginning of the end.</v>

1770
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:52.243
<v Speaker 13>Disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I'm sure these other colorful words I </v>

1771
01:28:53.421 --> 01:28:54.254
<v Speaker 13>would use when truck dance teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 13>one cass and their daughter Talia </v>

1772
01:28:59.421 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 13>boarded.</v>
<v Speaker 13>The reason we focus on the personal</v>

1773
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.640
<v Speaker 1>story of like people's Christine and her</v>
<v Speaker 1>hubby,</v>

1774
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:07.043
<v Speaker 1>they were all looking forward to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>best cruise yet every day was getting </v>

1775
01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:14.850
<v Speaker 1>closer or was it just the heartbeats </v>
<v Speaker 1>pumping out going crazy.</v>

1776
01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:17.850
<v Speaker 1>But I know just don't go on a cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean guys,</v>

1777
01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:20.580
<v Speaker 1>cruising is like the ocean version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zip lining.</v>

1778
01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I always say that it probably had zip </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines on that curve.</v>

1779
01:29:25.090 --> 01:29:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Zip Lines are so stupid and I've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>been on a cruise.</v>

1780
01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been one.</v>

1781
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:30.931
<v Speaker 1>It's awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1782
01:29:30.931 --> 01:29:31.764
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I hear someone was on a </v>

1783
01:29:32.911 --> 01:29:34.560
<v Speaker 1>cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds so bad.</v>

1784
01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.630
<v Speaker 1>And the worst part about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the middle.</v>

1785
01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:40.170
<v Speaker 1>You cannot fucking escape that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1786
01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who went racing</v>

1787
01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:44.570
<v Speaker 3>and you have this cluster phobic tiny </v>
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>

1788
01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't even let it go to your room</v>

1789
01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:48.014
<v Speaker 3>too if you're like Dang people over or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to go to your woman's tiny and </v>

<v Speaker 3>waves.</v>

1791
01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:56.723
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

1792
01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I'd like you to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't even get me started.</v>

<v Speaker 4>What is it about shopping in the shower </v>

<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I have roommates and it just </v>

2057
01:43:59.690 --> 01:44:03.290
<v Speaker 4>doesn't seem respectful really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I who goes down with the water?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:09.530
<v Speaker 4>Well I appreciate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you jerk off in the shower?</v>

2061
01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.753
<v Speaker 4>I know because jerking off in the shower</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking nasty because it can get caught </v>

2062
01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:15.404
<v Speaker 4>in the drain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've actually had roommates where </v>

2063
01:44:17.610 --> 01:44:20.660
<v Speaker 4>they jerk off in the shower and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>see it in the drain and that,</v>

2065
01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:25.053
<v Speaker 4>So I would say that jerking off in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shower with roommates is a little </v>

2066
01:44:28.431 --> 01:44:29.450
<v Speaker 4>stickier.</v>

2079
01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:03.710
<v Speaker 4>I live with two dudes in college and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to play a game called doopy extreme</v>

2080
01:45:03.711 --> 01:45:04.544
<v Speaker 4>where where you tried to run an </v>
<v Speaker 4>elaborate dupe on one of the housemates </v>

2081
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.863
<v Speaker 4>did the other two were on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would try to make them believe some </v>

2082
01:45:10.761 --> 01:45:12.560
<v Speaker 4>far fetched,</v>
<v Speaker 4>outrageous thing.</v>

2083
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:15.770
<v Speaker 4>And so this was my crowning achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I with the other guy,</v>

2084
01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:16.993
<v Speaker 4>we decided to try to convince our third </v>
<v Speaker 4>roommate who was kind of a Germaphobe </v>

2085
01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:24.410
<v Speaker 4>that we shit in the shower and that it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>normal and everybody fits in the shower.</v>

2086
01:45:24.411 --> 01:45:26.240
<v Speaker 4>So here's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was fun.</v>

2087
01:45:26.241 --> 01:45:27.074
<v Speaker 4>I'm proud of this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I arranged it with the other friend </v>

2088
01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:32.540
<v Speaker 4>and then I called a fourth friend and </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

2089
01:45:32.541 --> 01:45:34.370
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
