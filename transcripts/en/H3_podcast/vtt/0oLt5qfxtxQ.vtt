00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.390

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:27.730
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say loving English.</v>

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.080
<v Speaker 1>The charitable I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

12
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

13
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:39.520
<v Speaker 1>God bless them both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the soy boy boys are here.</v>

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>What is the soy boy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly?</v>

15
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no expert on the matter.</v>

16
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the resident.</v>

17
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I think soy is my favorite insult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it used to be cook.</v>

18
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.253
<v Speaker 1>We call people to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like whether or not you think it </v>

19
00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>has any power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get called a cocky,</v>

20
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

21
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:02.924
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.813
<v Speaker 1>as soy boys even funnier because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like directly attacking your </v>

23
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:08.210
<v Speaker 1>testosterone levels.</v>

24
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.273
<v Speaker 1>You're just not a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are a soy boy who's got soy in your </v>

25
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>veins and you don't eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what is the,</v>

26
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're a vegetarian.</v>

27
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was because soy makes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>tits bigger.</v>

28
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the,</v>

29
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 1>it increases estrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Estrogen apparently has estrogen in it.</v>

30
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.823
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

31
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>these guys really know it's a layered </v>
<v Speaker 1>term.</v>

32
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot going on.</v>

33
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Isn't as popular as cock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

34
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's been on its way for a while.</v>

35
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.833
<v Speaker 1>The stock is rising and falling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to genuinely insult somebody </v>

36
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>with a phrase like soy boy because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat jovial and a thrilling,</v>

37
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I've met more people who like this shirt</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the message of positivity and soy.</v>

38
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Then I have people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

39
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>that's really cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

40
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 1>and it's solely demasculated to eat soy </v>
<v Speaker 1>sauce and these guys Xyz.</v>

41
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

42
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.880
<v Speaker 1>fuck soy sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which food?</v>

43
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Overindulges in soy sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then things was,</v>

44
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>so I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not like,</v>

45
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.253
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that said their cholesterol is </v>

46
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>probably going to be great because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very high in sodium.</v>

47
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.210
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a health thing.</v>

48
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.730
<v Speaker 1>It might be a health thing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>

49
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.810
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless.</v>

50

<v Speaker 1>Back's corner.</v>

55
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.103
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get in the spirit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking with you a little bit </v>

56
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:44.060
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just I'm not in the Christmas spirit yet</v>

57
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:44.894
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the guide is because Christmas is </v>

58
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:47.204
<v Speaker 1>my favorite freaking holiday and I need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like wake up and get in that </v>

59
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Christmas spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's like,</v>

60
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:52.424
<v Speaker 1>just cause it's an outlay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean like that you've lived in La </v>

61
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 1>for eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that should be,</v>

62
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.580
<v Speaker 1>and your previous Christmases had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>jolly very,</v>

63
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>very few percent valley.</v>

64
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually like writing music and shit </v>

65
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>

66
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to like really get back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

67
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this Christmas?</v>

68
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:09.424
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jolly levels are a bit lower than </v>

69
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>previous years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

70
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Cause like back home we're watching all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

71
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>all the lifetime hallmark movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single one and each one worse than</v>

72
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:21.380
<v Speaker 1>the one after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

73
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>it's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're doing that.</v>

74
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:25.820
<v Speaker 1>We got all the ornaments and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

75
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.973
<v Speaker 1>you guys get gifts to each other where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think this year we're not going to do </v>

76
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just kind of over the gifts thing,</v>

77
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>but we usually do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that part of the problem?</v>

78
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

79
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.240
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

80
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.093
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

81
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

82
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.620
<v Speaker 1>it's so much more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

83
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to be in the Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit?</v>

84
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a young Jewish boy.</v>

85
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you Jewish?</v>

86
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.011
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

87
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do Christmas,</v>

88
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with Jack.</v>

89
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not feeling the spirit right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were a Jew.</v>

90
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.073
<v Speaker 1>Can I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you've got your name and your </v>

91
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 1>last name is off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cut that out and half,</v>

92
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>half the comments on my youtube channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>or people calling me that.</v>

93
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:06.061
<v Speaker 1>So everyone gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's almost as prevalent as toy.</v>

94
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

95
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>they're all the comments to one to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>combo.</v>

96
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>So explain to me a young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet Jewish lad.</v>

97
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean the Christmas spirit?</v>

98
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Because my dad has always been a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a grinch.</v>

99
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Christmas spirit was taken from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps.</v>

100
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>It helps if you just crank the music out</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as loud as you can in every room.</v>

101
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.093
<v Speaker 1>You know you do that well we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>previously so sometimes I would just </v>

102
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:39.680
<v Speaker 1>like and just play Christmas music.</v>

103
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>So let me tell you what's Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

104
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole world of the Alexa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

105
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.143
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I might get an back in Israel </v>

106
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.103
<v Speaker 1>like the half that stuff is not cool you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not going to play that God know God </v>

107
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:01.743
<v Speaker 1>help us all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because they didn't do an electric </v>

108
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>violin version of it for like a snickers</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial.</v>

109
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.340
<v Speaker 1>That thing has been playing for like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

110
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Trans Siberian orchestra style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

111
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Just to kind of like the rock and roll </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

112
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Is that the band that does it though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I,</v>

113
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.163
<v Speaker 1>so I always get them confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trans Siberian orchestra and then </v>

114
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:21.570
<v Speaker 1>there's another one and I'm sure you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys online,</v>

115
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get them mixed up,</v>

116
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 1>but they were both like very synth </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy,</v>

117
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.720
<v Speaker 1>you know that one is a transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transunion,</v>

118

127
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 1>music on the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

128

131
00:05:56.471 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>all the way through the new year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same cricon Christmas music and</v>

132
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear that shit.</v>

133
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear actual music that I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just once a year.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like one 12th of my whole year.</v>

136
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radio was grover late October.</v>

137
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole pillar.</v>

138
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:15.404
<v Speaker 1>They pick it up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they've got to figure it I think </v>

139
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>doing Christmas a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is,</v>

140
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.423
<v Speaker 1>I think Hanukkah music is neglected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Paul Mccartney never wrote a </v>

141
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Hanukkah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm digging into my own Rolodex.</v>

143
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Paul Mccartney wrote Christmas Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>

144
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.710

<v Speaker 1>He didn't write a Hanukkah song.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm intrigued though by your,</v>

162
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 1>you're having what seems to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential crisis in your life.</v>

163
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just lack of,</v>

164
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm just in a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird shape right now.</v>

165
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the Christmas thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole creativity thing,</v>

166
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:32.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burnout,</v>

167
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just figuring all that shit.</v>

168
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been through this in my,</v>

169
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.680
<v Speaker 1>in my personal life so many times in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>career and youtube,</v>

170
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.873
<v Speaker 1>but I'm fascinated by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a self feeding cycle in a </v>

171
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:47.924
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you getting negative comments from </v>

172
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:50.474
<v Speaker 1>your fans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that feeding it or like are they </v>

173
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:53.640
<v Speaker 1>supportive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>

174
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:54.703
<v Speaker 1>lately they've been extremely supportive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very thankful for that and they </v>

175
00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:57.944
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been giving me some pretty </v>

176
00:07:58.461 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 1>solid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

177
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 1>constructive criticism in the past just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because my,</v>

178
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.803
<v Speaker 1>my videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just been very stagnant and </v>

179
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 1>quantity or quality I should say.</v>

180
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Is that part of the issue for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the issue for me.</v>

181
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I get out of this Rut?</v>

182
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Because all my videos are like a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

183
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 1>how many theaters were the same and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hated where I was at and so it's like,</v>

184
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.800
<v Speaker 1>how do I get out of there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying new stuff and getting back</v>

185
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:23.310
<v Speaker 1>in the groove slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

186
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not perfect.</v>

187
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm fighting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

188
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.120
<v Speaker 1>what do you do when you're in a Rut?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was when I'm in a Rut.</v>

189
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.013
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I was going to say I don't know </v>

190
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:31.540
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh for,</v>

191
00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 1>well no I'm not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like what's up?</v>

192
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.800
<v Speaker 1>What's the opposite of a rough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What stops it over Rut of role?</v>

193
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.170
<v Speaker 1>A role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

194
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.043
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a role in a role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to roll down the hill from a </v>

195
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

196
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm rolling down a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on fire.</v>

197
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>You're never in a fucking towards a Rut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't post enough to be in a rush.</v>

198
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:51.543
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

199
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that would help.</v>

200
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I guess that would help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why don't you,</v>

201
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to post more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will not happen.</v>

202
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Well I think in my cleaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know who would,</v>

203
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 1>what would help that along is if I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a studio.</v>

204
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause right now I film everything in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

205
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.703
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I had like a dedicated space I </v>

206
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 1>could go to and film things in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

207
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I just like overthink shit before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>start filming it.</v>

208
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.623
<v Speaker 1>Which wouldn't that give like a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that give you incentive to like </v>

209
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.970
<v Speaker 1>get out of bed and go to work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird to like,</v>

210
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>cause I wake up and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's where I'm going all day.</v>

211
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just my chair recreation in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and your personal life.</v>

212
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.750

<v Speaker 1>this isn't my fed anymore.</v>

213
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:34.330
<v Speaker 1>This is my tripod and I used to be our </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment in New York.</v>

214
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 1>It was really rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

215
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 1>it's your living room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bedroom,</v>

218
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you've got ac in there I believe in.</v>

219
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:47.990

<v Speaker 1>finally got a seat.</v>

220
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.923

<v Speaker 1>But I'm never going to use it too </v>

221
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 1>offensive or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

222
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I just like being sweaty so I just want </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to have it.</v>

223
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll use it when I'm editing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>cause I've been there,</v>

234
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.250
<v Speaker 1>people have been telling me they miss </v>
<v Speaker 1>the old ethan forever,</v>

235
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's have like case from the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear that.</v>

236
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I hate hearing that even when it's in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good way because they mean the best.</v>

237
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 1>But it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a double edge to compliment.</v>

238
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to,</v>

239
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.133
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard not to look back but you kind </v>

240
00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:45.840
<v Speaker 1>of have to not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

241
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

242
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.323
<v Speaker 1>I think it's amb because well first off </v>
<v Speaker 1>senses of humor do evolve over time and </v>

243
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found funding five years ago,</v>

244
00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:55.320
<v Speaker 1>even two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't find funny now.</v>

245
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I find it funny in a different way.</v>

246
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:57.923
<v Speaker 1>I do feel like sometimes I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go back in the archives and </v>

247
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:04.530
<v Speaker 1>figure out what was I doing back then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was that I just wouldn't even think</v>

248
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:06.120
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's like that's where he gets</v>

249
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.440
<v Speaker 1>explained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what it was.</v>

250
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I find when I look back on my live </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>

251
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not so much that like I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

252
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:13.404
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really about the state of mind </v>

253
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.520
<v Speaker 1>because you're in a healthy place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind,</v>

254
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you doubt yourself less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You question yourself less and you're,</v>

255
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.133
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that when I'm in a better head </v>

256
00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:26.460
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always making better stuff.</v>

257
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.593
<v Speaker 1>So I've found that it's very much about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how I'm feeling rather than something </v>

258
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:36.770
<v Speaker 1>specifically I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you kind of like just fearlessly,</v>

259
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 1>just like making shit and moving on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

260
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.430
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

261
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.323
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just get in these like that's a good </v>

262
00:11:44.221 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 1>way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I do,</v>

263
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I pace around the house like all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

264
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:48.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sad.</v>

265
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.833
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you just trying to think of ideas </v>

266
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 1>and I'm talking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fleshing out ideas and jokes.</v>

267
00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Is this funny and will this work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

268
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.010
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

269
00:11:57.011 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 1>being in the right state of mind I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>would work wonders in therapy.</v>

270
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.710
<v Speaker 1>I am not in therapy personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

271
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.630
<v Speaker 1>but for me it's been huge because I been</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

272
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.110
<v Speaker 2>and I always thought of therapy has </v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

273
00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:11.300
<v Speaker 2>like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

274
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.970
<v Speaker 2>fucking smell your own asshole while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at it.</v>

275
00:12:13.971 --> 00:12:14.804
<v Speaker 2>Therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I swear to God it's helped me a lot </v>

276
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:18.853
<v Speaker 2>and I think it actually helped me get </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of my rut because there's so much </v>

277
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.730
<v Speaker 2>other shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

278
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.913
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really so hard to step out of </v>

279
00:12:26.571 --> 00:12:28.700
<v Speaker 2>yourself and see what's the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

280
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of the times the real problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not something that you are addressing</v>

281
00:12:32.511 --> 00:12:33.344
<v Speaker 2>or even aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that honestly has been really </v>

282
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:37.783
<v Speaker 2>valuable to me.</v>

283
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.990
<v Speaker 1>How once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice a year,</v>

284
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I go once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tells me I need to come twice a week,</v>

285
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really ought to come twice a week,</v>

286
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:46.384
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucked up.</v>

287
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 1>You did therapy or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have,</v>

288
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

289
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:54.060
<v Speaker 1>You're cured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

290
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:55.443
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like pausing your netflix </v>

291
00:12:56.351 --> 00:12:57.184
<v Speaker 1>subscription.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just nothing on right now that </v>

292
00:12:58.151 --> 00:13:00.210
<v Speaker 1>it needs my attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

293
00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful metaphor.</v>

294
00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:02.290
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

295
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

296
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 1>there shouldn't be a stigma about </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy even though the,</v>

297
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like to put one there just </v>

298
00:13:07.961 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not going to one,</v>

299
00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 1>so I must be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a week later,</v>

300
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:13.140
<v Speaker 1>like their grandma dies and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

301
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she might want to unravel that yarn.</v>

302
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>

303
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.190
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a reason you haven't considered</v>

304
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:23.080
<v Speaker 2>therapy or you just felt like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't needed it</v>

305
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.323
<v Speaker 1>but you never get over the ladder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just never put much thought into </v>

306
00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:27.544
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I don't believe in it </v>

307
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.320
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

308
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it would do me good.</v>

309
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just haven't pursued it because it's a</v>

310
00:13:33.941 --> 00:13:37.000
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole thing and I'm not,</v>

311
00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not knocking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I could,</v>

312
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I could absolutely benefit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

313
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I got to figure,</v>

314
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say I got to figure it out,</v>

315
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:49.060
<v Speaker 1>but I know therapy would help if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the thing is</v>

316
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.370
<v Speaker 2>stuck in a Rut for so long and I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>

317
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.240
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't like super irritable and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>super just like,</v>

318
00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:59.663
<v Speaker 2>like I was always trying to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and run and run and run and I was </v>

319
00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:05.310
<v Speaker 2>just running like a hamster wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is your situation,</v>

320
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:08.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm just totally on my own person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like I was in a hamster wheel</v>

321
00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:10.890
<v Speaker 2>for like a whole year just running and </v>
<v Speaker 2>was getting worse and worse and worse.</v>

322
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I just had like a breaking point </v>

323
00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:13.644
<v Speaker 2>where I started taking medicine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>started going to therapy and I think </v>

324
00:14:18.241 --> 00:14:21.090
<v Speaker 2>that was like three months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I tell you that life change you.</v>

325
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.630
<v Speaker 1>That's fantastic man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

326
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean what was the story is not your </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist coming on the show cut.</v>

327
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I hear him laughing back.</v>

328
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Good dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My staff.</v>

329
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.470
<v Speaker 1>You want to make sure I love that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

330
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

331
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.750
<v Speaker 1>The last time I went to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

332
00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I really think you should come twice a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

333
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:45.591
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

334
00:14:45.591 --> 00:14:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too much.</v>

335

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to have your foot down </v>

336

<v Speaker 1>keep it on your couch.</v>

444
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.250

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:00.364
<v Speaker 1>he's absolutely promoting celibacy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet at the same time he just wants a </v>

449
00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:03.334
<v Speaker 1>hand guy.</v>

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Whoa darth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She told her whole class,</v>

467
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.530
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women do not enjoy sex and I had watched</v>

468
00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:58.720
<v Speaker 1>a lot of porn in my life by then and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

469
00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:00.070
<v Speaker 1>that is not the impression I got.</v>

470
00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 1>And I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I know porn oversells it,</v>

471
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:05.200
<v Speaker 1>but I was really common ties with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I was like,</v>

475
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:18.150

476
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:20.170
<v Speaker 1>and make a baby and then you take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

477
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.680
<v Speaker 1>She got her across shit wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither party should enjoy it.</v>

478
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.163

<v Speaker 1>Just just don't do it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the lovely bones.</v>

652
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.783

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

653
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:09.923
<v Speaker 3>an additional PA crew member swing guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>in there somewhere and got to like a </v>

654
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:16.343
<v Speaker 3>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I got to see him walking around on </v>

655
00:29:17.161 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 3>set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>

656
00:29:18.331 --> 00:29:20.250
<v Speaker 3>he was always in a good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was whistling,</v>

657
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:22.170
<v Speaker 3>singing a cup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee in his hand,</v>

658
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.490
<v Speaker 3>just bopping along like the little soy </v>
<v Speaker 3>soy boy.</v>

659
00:29:24.491 --> 00:29:28.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he was like this dude was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really got a stain on it.</v>

660
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.530
<v Speaker 3>I really should have gotten this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>dry clean before the stain does not come</v>

661
00:29:31.531 --> 00:29:32.364
<v Speaker 3>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you need to dry clean </v>

662
00:29:34.831 --> 00:29:39.570
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean cause Nah so positive.</v>

663
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 3>He probably goes in his trailer</v>

664
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.630
<v Speaker 1>and like punches punching someone in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

665
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I like to warn me about like eye contact</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that.</v>

666
00:29:48.791 --> 00:29:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about with celebrities but </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just looking at it wrong.</v>

668
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's required.</v>

669
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Don't make I Oakland like there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about that's appearance Hannity.</v>

670
00:29:57.881 --> 00:30:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Really super good actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who liked did Lincoln,</v>

671
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Day Lewis.</v>

672
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.170
<v Speaker 1>No eye contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

673
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.910
<v Speaker 1>the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

674
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:12.010
<v Speaker 1>eye contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

675
00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:12.844
<v Speaker 1>If that was accurate as needed then like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best actor would need that for like </v>

676
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 1>his method acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I get it.</v>

677
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You look him in the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucks up his character shit.</v>

678
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.720
<v Speaker 1>But he was like between takes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln,</v>

679
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.570
<v Speaker 1>just like chilling with the crew and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like telling stories and stuff and can,</v>

680
00:30:26.571 --> 00:30:27.360
<v Speaker 1>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

681
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just out of character.</v>

682
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.303
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

683
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.350
<v Speaker 1>let's go again.</v>

684
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

685
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

686
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.170
<v Speaker 1>So I mean maybe that's just how good he </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

687
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:36.063
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me doubt the whole eye contact </v>

688
00:30:37.781 --> 00:30:39.580
<v Speaker 1>thing that it's like a performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

690
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.650

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

693
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:51.400
<v Speaker 1>but that's like dominance thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like I have to,</v>

694
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:53.981
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

846
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:05.230
<v Speaker 1>making eye contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just me and like,</v>

847
00:38:05.231 --> 00:38:06.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this camera right here,</v>

848
00:38:06.821 --> 00:38:09.730
<v Speaker 1>if there's somebody standing to the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

849
00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.250
<v Speaker 1>you're like kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

850
00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.173
<v Speaker 1>drawn to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to look at two and you're </v>

851
00:38:14.771 --> 00:38:16.060
<v Speaker 1>seeing what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're acting,</v>

852
00:38:16.061 --> 00:38:18.610
<v Speaker 1>if anybody that walks in the back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like,</v>

853
00:38:18.611 --> 00:38:20.110
<v Speaker 1>it makes your eyes jiggle a little bit.</v>

854
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.050
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like at the same time it's very easy</v>

855
00:38:23.051 --> 00:38:25.200
<v Speaker 1>to your professional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

856
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And it just ruins the illusion though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

857
00:38:27.341 --> 00:38:30.730
<v Speaker 1>nobody's standing next to a camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the case of,</v>

858
00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some diva that wants that kind of shit.</v>

859
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's saying next to the camera going</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>holding the camera.</v>

863
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.680
<v Speaker 1>So recently,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the most powerful men in the world </v>

871
00:39:08.381 --> 00:39:12.160

<v Speaker 1>himself before our government.</v>

872
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:16.510
<v Speaker 1>And this is the question that our best </v>
<v Speaker 1>and brightest elected officials have for</v>

873
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:17.980
<v Speaker 1>the CEO of Google.</v>

874
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:19.623
<v Speaker 5>I have a seven year old granddaughter </v>
<v Speaker 5>who picked up her phone before the </v>

<v Speaker 5>grandfather,</v>

877
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:31.683
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not going to say into their </v>
<v Speaker 5>record what is the kind of language was </v>

878
00:39:34.001 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 5>used around that picture of her </v>
<v Speaker 5>grandfather.</v>

879
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:37.294
<v Speaker 5>But I'd ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how does that show up on a seven year </v>

880
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:40.990
<v Speaker 5>old's iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's playing a kid's game?</v>

881
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:45.880
<v Speaker 5>Congressmen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a iphone is made by a different company.</v>

882
00:39:45.881 --> 00:39:46.980
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

883
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean I might've been an Android,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just,</v>

884
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.580
<v Speaker 5>it was a hand me down at some guidance.</v>

885
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

886
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:55.890
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I pause?</v>

887
00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:57.203
<v Speaker 1>I have questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to what's going on with this </v>

888
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:03.680
<v Speaker 1>guy in the backseat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monopoly guy protest.</v>

889
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.450
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>

890
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I think she's a female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

891
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.060
<v Speaker 1>we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen her.</v>

892
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:13.973
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's the same person she was at </v>

893
00:40:15.811 --> 00:40:17.970
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another hearing,</v>

894
00:40:17.971 --> 00:40:21.900
<v Speaker 1>another congressional hearing where she </v>
<v Speaker 1>dressed up in the exact same attire,</v>

895
00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:25.050
<v Speaker 1>adjusted the monocle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that easy to get in there.</v>

896
00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.293
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to the public hearing </v>

897
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:32.820
<v Speaker 1>come in later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had to guess,</v>

898
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I would say the mustache wasn't on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

899
00:40:34.651 --> 00:40:35.940
<v Speaker 1>you mean the entered?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

900
00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they pull off right now and that</v>

901
00:40:40.831 --> 00:40:43.470
<v Speaker 1>she got a prime location to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a good headline.</v>

902
00:40:43.471 --> 00:40:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Immediately caught my eye when the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

903
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.183
<v Speaker 1>the answer the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've washed his feet of several times </v>

904
00:40:48.571 --> 00:40:50.870
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm just noticing this person </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

905
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.063
<v Speaker 1>It's the guy's dribbling a basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a gorilla walking in the </v>

906
00:40:55.561 --> 00:40:58.140
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those videos.</v>

907
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:02.420
<v Speaker 1>So let's continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're almost more litigation,</v>

908
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.220
<v Speaker 1>which was being used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

909
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a specification,</v>

910
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.750
<v Speaker 1>but I'm happy to understand it better </v>
<v Speaker 1>and clarify it for you.</v>

911
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.103
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's thank you for your testimony and </v>

912
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.110
<v Speaker 1>yield back the balance sheets that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

913
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:17.600
<v Speaker 1>what is he complaining about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A picture of,</v>

914
00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of him,</v>

915
00:41:19.321 --> 00:41:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I guess he said of her grandpa came up </v>
<v Speaker 1>on her phone.</v>

916
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Now how does that happen on the iphone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

917
00:41:24.211 --> 00:41:26.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Google.</v>

918
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.383
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to take into </v>

919
00:41:28.831 --> 00:41:30.960
<v Speaker 1>consideration this guy doesn't know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck he's talking.</v>

920
00:41:30.961 --> 00:41:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

921
00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.053
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like imagine you've got this guy </v>

922
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:42.590
<v Speaker 1>historically powerful person and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing this dump.</v>

923
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Like even if it was the wrong company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just imagine asking like,</v>

924

<v Speaker 1>millions of people paying aol dial up to</v>

<v Speaker 1>Millions of people.</v>

00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Where are these in the states are </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathered throughout the states.</v>

948
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida is a Florida man,</v>

949
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:54.260
<v Speaker 1>probably Florida.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandma.</v>

951
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I would be surprised if my grandparents </v>
<v Speaker 1>were still paying aol.com</v>

952
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.060
<v Speaker 1>dial up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>how would they learn though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to upgrade to,</v>

956
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not dial up,</v>

957
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:12.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to where they learn.</v>

958
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Presumably a grandson who's better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

959
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.720
<v Speaker 1>but I'm justifying their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're faultless fusion.</v>

963
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:22.603
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confused.</v>

964
00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:23.523
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there they are faultless because they </v>

965
00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:26.570
<v Speaker 1>didn't even understand it when it came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out back then.</v>

966
00:43:26.571 --> 00:43:28.730
<v Speaker 1>They were old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're super old.</v>

967
00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Pick that up pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

968
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:31.491
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

969
00:43:31.491 --> 00:43:32.510
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got that,</v>

970
00:43:32.511 --> 00:43:34.160
<v Speaker 1>that is our responsibility.</v>

971
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.911
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

972
00:43:34.911 --> 00:43:36.860
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to not kill the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

973
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Leave us some fucking money for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>retirement funds.</v>

974
00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:45.310
<v Speaker 1>All we have to do is plug their </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers each way so they can get their</v>

975
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:48.230
<v Speaker 1>emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't viruses twice as fast.</v>

977
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:52.724
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good point because </v>

978
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:58.631
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge problem of people preying</v>
<v Speaker 1>on old people and scheming money.</v>

979
00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.300

985
00:44:12.231 --> 00:44:14.900
<v Speaker 1>but she's old as fuck on a land line.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess it's easy to know when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera's on you,</v>

1041
00:46:50.111 --> 00:46:53.020
<v Speaker 1>but like he clicks into it every time </v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera cuts to him.</v>

1042
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:55.030
<v Speaker 1>He's got great timing really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really does.</v>

1043
00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Great framing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1044
00:46:56.121 --> 00:46:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Awareness might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it is a sheet so,</v>

1045
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.113
<v Speaker 1>well it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to tell him this video </v>

1046
00:47:02.741 --> 00:47:03.574
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the older video from like a few months </v>

1047
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.120

<v Speaker 1>character but this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they look very intrigued.</v>

1055

<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

1061
00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:46.720

<v Speaker 1>in the area,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>viewed categories of porn at 2018 by </v>

<v Speaker 1>you'll see there's some interest.</v>

1088
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:07.743
<v Speaker 1>The U s loves lesbian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't all south of America really </v>

1090
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:18.123
<v Speaker 1>all of Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so many people in Japan are </v>

1091
00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:21.820
<v Speaker 1>watching Hentai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucked up the whole continent.</v>

1092
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Like Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1093
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very surprised.</v>

1094
00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.920
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be all of the eastern block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

1095
00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:31.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of the former Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

1096
00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:33.423
<v Speaker 1>That blows my mind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've tried Hentai just out of </v>

1097
00:49:36.301 --> 00:49:38.770
<v Speaker 1>pure curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

1098
00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Real porn available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1099
00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I just jerk off the captain planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>

1100
00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:51.520
<v Speaker 1>should I move to Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1101
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:57.640
<v Speaker 1>The live action porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cartoon girl.</v>

1102
00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:00.813
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm shocked about Russia because </v>

1103
00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:06.430
<v Speaker 1>normally when I see these types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>graphs and bar charts and such,</v>

1104
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:07.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1105
00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:08.943
<v Speaker 1>the most repressed places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like if if gay porn or if gay art is </v>

1106
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:15.844
<v Speaker 1>just largely banned and frowned upon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then usually that territory has gay </v>

1107
00:50:19.571 --> 00:50:20.440
<v Speaker 1>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1108
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.071
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1109
00:50:21.071 --> 00:50:23.320
<v Speaker 1>they're like states in the u s it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

1110
00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Or anytime the Republican national </v>
<v Speaker 1>convention comes to the,</v>

1111
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I'm shocked about Russia</v>

1112
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.880
<v Speaker 3>since like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1113
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 3>being gay is a big no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1114
00:50:30.051 --> 00:50:31.880
<v Speaker 3>In Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all about the Hentai.</v>

1115
00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you grain new,</v>

1116
00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:36.530
<v Speaker 3>if you took a closer look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when I've seen that where you're</v>

1117
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:37.364
<v Speaker 3>talking about like in the u s like in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kansas everyone's watching gay porn or </v>

1118
00:50:39.661 --> 00:50:41.330
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1119
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.510
<v Speaker 3>but it's so broad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the green one?</v>

1120
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:45.501
<v Speaker 3>The green.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1121
00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:49.640

<v Speaker 3>which is in North Africa and the one and</v>

<v Speaker 3>which is black.</v>

1123
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.400

<v Speaker 3>they're trying,</v>

1124
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:56.660
<v Speaker 3>they want to get down with their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1165
00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:11.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised that lesbian porn is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>predominant.</v>

1166
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everywhere across the sea.</v>

1167
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:16.670
<v Speaker 3>The normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all friends here.</v>

1168
00:53:16.671 --> 00:53:17.504
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just like a Western civilization </v>

1169
00:53:18.771 --> 00:53:20.050
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1170
00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Have I value on lesbians?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

1171
00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.610
<v Speaker 3>this is big for gay acceptance.</v>

1172
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:30.320
<v Speaker 3>That's not progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to know what he are.</v>

1173
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:32.890
<v Speaker 3>ICKY.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But lesbians sounded,</v>

1174
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.650
<v Speaker 3>I know don't match that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought we lived in lesbian.</v>

1175
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.540
<v Speaker 3>Is that lesbian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was,</v>

1176
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.433
<v Speaker 3>I thought I thought this was a map with </v>
<v Speaker 3>names of the places and that is the </v>

1177
00:53:44.831 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1178
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.080
<v Speaker 3>that was the bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was good.</v>

1179
00:53:46.081 --> 00:53:48.450
<v Speaker 3>It was all a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big,</v>

1180
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:53.451
<v Speaker 3>big country is the best anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan,</v>

1181
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.710
<v Speaker 3>can you help me clarify?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who's in a big deck?</v>

1182
00:53:55.711 --> 00:53:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Pakistanian who are these guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's Nepal.</v>

1183
00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Both have little dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1184
00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:04.420
<v Speaker 3>do you have data on that?</v>

1185
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.123
<v Speaker 3>I think the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think why lesbian porn is so popular </v>

1186
00:54:12.721 --> 00:54:14.700
<v Speaker 3>is because men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1187
00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:19.710
<v Speaker 3>sure it's crowd pleasing because dudes </v>
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>

1188
00:54:19.711 --> 00:54:20.431
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hot.</v>

1189
00:54:20.431 --> 00:54:21.870
<v Speaker 3>And then of course girls will like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1190
00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:23.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly.</v>

1191
00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:24.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1192
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.333
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We learned earlier that women don't </v>

1193
00:54:27.001 --> 00:54:30.590
<v Speaker 3>enjoy sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you know that,</v>

1194
00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.700
<v Speaker 3>I find that interesting that people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa are watching Ebony and then North</v>

1195
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:36.960
<v Speaker 3>Africa Arab world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there are Arab,</v>

1196
00:54:36.961 --> 00:54:38.620

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1197
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.980
<v Speaker 3>you want to see your own content,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own peeps.</v>

<v Speaker 3>people will say that Hi Eric,</v>

1227
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.450
<v Speaker 3>I know what it is because of all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>video games are played.</v>

1228
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:10.230
<v Speaker 3>All of my geography comes from hearts of</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole milk thing.</v>

1233
00:56:17.851 --> 00:56:22.500
<v Speaker 3>It was sort of an eye opening thing when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized that I'm old enough that MILF</v>

1234
00:56:22.501 --> 00:56:25.830
<v Speaker 3>porn is just for women my age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1235
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.210
<v Speaker 3>That was kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the oh shit moment right there.</v>

1236
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's real.</v>

1237
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:31.150
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are you saying that that the ones who</v>

1238
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:33.030
<v Speaker 3>never moved out of their homes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can ask funny.</v>

1239
00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I don't have to go.</v>

1240
00:56:34.741 --> 00:56:37.330
<v Speaker 3>I didn't agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I look at MILF porn,</v>

1241
00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 3>I see like old days with fake titties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said it earlier.</v>

1242
00:56:40.121 --> 00:56:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean it kind of runs a range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

1243
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:46.750
<v Speaker 2>it does seem to mill is almost like late</v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties to forties and 50s.</v>

1244
00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:52.450
<v Speaker 2>When you go to a porn site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you type MILF?</v>

1245
00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:54.380
<v Speaker 3>Are you kind of just rolling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1246
00:56:54.381 --> 00:56:55.214
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1247
00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.500
<v Speaker 3>Can we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we consciously seeking it out?</v>

1248
00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:58.453
<v Speaker 3>Anal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like we're not giving anal its </v>

1249
00:56:59.871 --> 00:57:02.280
<v Speaker 3>fair share of the spotlight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1250
00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:03.163
<v Speaker 3>but the whole country's do a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was expecting to see more anal in the </v>

1251
00:57:06.291 --> 00:57:08.480
<v Speaker 3>chart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw somebody point out that the,</v>

1252
00:57:08.481 --> 00:57:10.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Mideast there,</v>

1253
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:12.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anal block,</v>

1254
00:57:12.051 --> 00:57:16.040
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no block block is the exact,</v>

1255
00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.770
<v Speaker 3>a territory of the old Persian empire </v>
<v Speaker 3>for some reason.</v>

1256
00:57:18.771 --> 00:57:21.380
<v Speaker 3>So there's gotta be some correlation </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1257
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:24.230
<v Speaker 3>History buffs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please hook us up.</v>

1258
00:57:24.231 --> 00:57:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Please help us out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that in Germany?</v>

1259
00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:26.973
<v Speaker 3>I would see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1260
00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:31.160
<v Speaker 3>well that's funny because all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iceland apparently.</v>

1261
00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iceland is just anal.</v>

1262
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Is Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Milfs yes.</v>

1263
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

1264
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:42.490
<v Speaker 3>That's a surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see it.</v>

1265
00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:45.383
<v Speaker 2>So then there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also a lot of weird </v>

1266
00:57:47.671 --> 00:57:52.671
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that you can't do with real </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like tentacle rec rape.</v>

1267
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:56.040
<v Speaker 2>And it's just I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just so bizarre.</v>

1268
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:57.263
<v Speaker 2>But I think a lot of it's got to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardwired from kids watching cause </v>

1269
00:57:59.431 --> 00:58:03.150
<v Speaker 2>there's some bomb ass cartoon characters</v>

<v Speaker 1>the email and I don't,</v>

1397

<v Speaker 1>I don't doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't discriminate.</v>

1399
01:03:31.531 --> 01:03:32.364
<v Speaker 1>Like a few days ago go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the guy who won Gamer of the </v>

<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it showed up in a costume.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was a furry and he came out and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>very costume and he accepted it.</v>

1402
01:03:41.821 --> 01:03:45.480
<v Speaker 1>And how is being a furry con like how in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 90s people were like,</v>

1403
01:03:45.481 --> 01:03:47.910
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we taking it that far?</v>

1404
01:03:47.911 --> 01:03:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's that,</v>

1405
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>are they looking for acceptance or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll looking for recognition but,</v>

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.800
<v Speaker 1>but why is it that serious don't take </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves that seriously?</v>

<v Speaker 1>They weren't,</v>

1409
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't really that mad.</v>

1410
01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:02.100
<v Speaker 1>It was more just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1411
01:04:02.101 --> 01:04:04.050
<v Speaker 1>just want to let you know it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>always a sexual thing,</v>

1412
01:04:04.051 --> 01:04:05.150
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

1413
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:05.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just sort of expanding on it </v>

1414
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:08.963
<v Speaker 1>as far as like my viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know when I get tweets and </v>

1415
01:04:11.011 --> 01:04:13.830
<v Speaker 1>stuff from people you can see by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>profile picture that like,</v>

1416
01:04:13.831 --> 01:04:15.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's them in a furry thing.</v>

1417
01:04:15.271 --> 01:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1418
01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:17.710
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never met a mean one yet,</v>

1419
01:04:17.711 --> 01:04:19.890
<v Speaker 3>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm prone to like them.</v>

1420
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:22.720
<v Speaker 3>They are very great community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cool though,</v>

1421
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:24.043
<v Speaker 3>dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why you guys being all nice and I look </v>

1422
01:04:24.731 --> 01:04:28.790
<v Speaker 3>like a cynical asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1423
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.433
<v Speaker 3>I have a whole list of hateful things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always look like the asshole one </v>

1424
01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:42.550
<v Speaker 3>fucking time indigenous peoples today.</v>

1425
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did ask this question when </v>

1426
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:50.210
<v Speaker 1>tenacious d was here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they are,</v>

1427
01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.900
<v Speaker 1>they're really into the role playing so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they must paint their dick red.</v>

1428
01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:57.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the worries?</v>

1429
01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Cause we like a dog bone or like dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>boner.</v>

1430
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Like it goes red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the red rocket kind of thing.</v>

1431
01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Because if you just pay it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take out a human dick,</v>

1432
01:05:04.761 --> 01:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>that ain't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1433
01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a a very amusing thought.</v>

1434
01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

1435
01:05:10.090 --> 01:05:11.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they'd take it to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1436
01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>What would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong for who?</v>

1437
01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:15.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think they go that like </v>

1438
01:05:17.951 --> 01:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1439
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.001
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1440
01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:21.850
<v Speaker 3>that's a method like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some Daniel Day Lewis Shit right there.</v>

1441
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:22.773
<v Speaker 3>That's some real Marlon Brando Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about animals with really strange </v>

1442
01:05:25.451 --> 01:05:27.470
<v Speaker 3>penis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little ducks.</v>

1443
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:29.751
<v Speaker 3>Ducks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1444
01:05:29.751 --> 01:05:31.990

<v Speaker 3>So they probably mutilate their penis.</v>

1445
01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:36.310
<v Speaker 3>You just need a little spirit gum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a big,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're welcome.</v>

1463
01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:27.030
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to the,</v>

1464
01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:29.230
<v Speaker 3>the furry train.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I know I'm not caught up,</v>

1465
01:06:29.231 --> 01:06:30.064
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought of actually getting one </v>

1466
01:06:31.511 --> 01:06:33.570
<v Speaker 3>in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already had a like a,</v>

1467
01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:34.653
<v Speaker 3>an arc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You was my life on the Internet where </v>

1468
01:06:36.131 --> 01:06:37.840
<v Speaker 3>like when I first learned about furries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1469
01:06:37.841 --> 01:06:39.250
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate it.</v>

1470
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:41.740
<v Speaker 3>And then it evolved into like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1471
01:06:41.741 --> 01:06:43.540
<v Speaker 3>there's just nothing wrong with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking people at all.</v>

1472
01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you had a good time,</v>

1473
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:48.730
<v Speaker 3>a comment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etiquette video on furries?</v>

1474
01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:49.683
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have given them such a hard time </v>

1475
01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:54.820
<v Speaker 3>on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like it'd be targeted.</v>

1476
01:06:54.821 --> 01:06:57.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be lumped in with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>demeanor side.</v>

1477
01:06:57.221 --> 01:06:59.110
<v Speaker 3>I hear that's a guy.</v>

1478
01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:00.743
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1479
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:03.310
<v Speaker 3>I think they'd have it honestly though </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my experience,</v>

1480
01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:04.750
<v Speaker 3>they have a very good sense of humor </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1481
01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:05.613
<v Speaker 3>If you did it tastefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you do do stuff tastefully comedic </v>

1482
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:09.860
<v Speaker 3>wise I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1483
01:07:09.861 --> 01:07:11.350
<v Speaker 3>no you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You I think,</v>

1484
01:07:11.351 --> 01:07:12.184
<v Speaker 3>I think you could get away with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly and it'd be very funny and </v>

1485
01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:14.910
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1486
01:07:14.911 --> 01:07:16.870
<v Speaker 3>if I did well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just perplexed.</v>

1487
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.000
<v Speaker 3>I would never be able to beef for views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1488
01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:24.060
<v Speaker 3>I just am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And their costumes are so weird.</v>

1489
01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the familiar face.</v>

1490
01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:28.120
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's strange.</v>

1491
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:29.500
<v Speaker 3>What's weird about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ethan?</v>

1492
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all look like a fucking acid trip.</v>

1493
01:07:33.881 --> 01:07:35.650
<v Speaker 3>Like humanoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1494
01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.270
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1495
01:07:37.271 --> 01:07:38.530
<v Speaker 3>Let's get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's move on.</v>

1496
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:39.833
<v Speaker 3>We're like an hour a furry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there was like an outside group </v>

1497

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>

1604
01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.513
<v Speaker 1>they have less than 900,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers are going to get to a </v>

1605
01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.453
<v Speaker 1>million by the end of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone pushes for them because </v>

1682
01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:46.860

<v Speaker 1>because this is a guy,</v>

1683
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.903
<v Speaker 1>the soul of a gangster and the body of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>child and even those recording him who </v>

1684
01:18:52.021 --> 01:18:52.854

1688
01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.270
<v Speaker 1>He didn't choke half a beer and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he matched,</v>

1689
01:19:11.370 --> 01:19:13.890
<v Speaker 1>obliterated on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was amazing.</v>

1703
01:20:04.051 --> 01:20:06.660
<v Speaker 1>liveliest thing I've ever seen and I was</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm a nerd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I grew up on the end like even </v>

1730
01:21:33.391 --> 01:21:34.224
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had a game cube so I never </v>

1731
01:21:34.981 --> 01:21:36.300
<v Speaker 3>played melee and cubes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

1732
01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:39.390
<v Speaker 3>I went right from [inaudible] 64 to weep</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I never had an inbetween.</v>

1733
01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:42.510
<v Speaker 3>I know the game cube is a great system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I grew up on the,</v>

1734
01:21:42.511 --> 01:21:43.344
<v Speaker 3>on the laggy slow and 64 version.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if there were too many characters </v>

1735
01:21:46.921 --> 01:21:48.780
<v Speaker 3>and smashing and 64 it would slow it </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1736
01:21:48.781 --> 01:21:49.614
<v Speaker 3>It would turn into like a powerpoint </v>
<v Speaker 3>presentation and 15 frames a second and </v>

1737
01:21:51.931 --> 01:21:54.270

01:28:00.781 --> 01:28:01.614
<v Speaker 3>from getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] story for a long time was </v>

1879
01:28:06.691 --> 01:28:08.460
<v Speaker 3>that he blinded him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

1880
01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:13.490
<v Speaker 3>I see an article where they interviewed </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy that got beaten up and he claims</v>

1881
01:28:13.861 --> 01:28:14.694
<v Speaker 3>he was already blind in one eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that was a kind of a miss </v>

1882
01:28:17.650 --> 01:28:18.483
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the source on this is the daily </v>

1883
01:28:21.151 --> 01:28:22.020
<v Speaker 3>mail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is garbage.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but there is a website called bad dragon</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has quote wearables,</v>

<v Speaker 3>started complaining about,</v>

1959
01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.970
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're happier with me.</v>

1962
01:31:54.650 --> 01:31:56.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1964
01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:04.293
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want elog off getting some like </v>

1965

<v Speaker 3>fucking robot,</v>

1966
01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:12.350
<v Speaker 3>insane cock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's purely Tori.</v>

1967
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:14.950
<v Speaker 3>No Web apps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's jacked.</v>

1968
01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:20.100
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking handsome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Averagely hung the robot.</v>

1969
01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

1970
01:32:23.370 --> 01:32:27.040
<v Speaker 3>But if why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go and hang out with the robot,</v>

1971
01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:29.580
<v Speaker 3>starts spending time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1972
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:32.680
<v Speaker 3>That's when it gets a little weird when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1973
01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.780
<v Speaker 3>when you're not fucking the robot you </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean?</v>

1974
01:32:34.781 --> 01:32:39.781
<v Speaker 3>Or just like plain smashed with Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's opening a door and like the robot.</v>

1975
01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:45.010
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get Out.</v>

1976
01:32:47.610 --> 01:32:48.443
<v Speaker 3>It's like the printer in your bedroom </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to keep them plugged a </v>

1977
01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:53.733
<v Speaker 3>westward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Susan one before they found out a data </v>

1978
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:59.800
<v Speaker 3>lake world loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to spoil it.</v>

1979
01:32:59.801 --> 01:33:02.230
<v Speaker 3>So if you haven't watched Westworld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just skip for the next 30 seconds.</v>

1980
01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:03.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys have all seen it.</v>

1981
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:04.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1982
01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.113
<v Speaker 3>So when they're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are scanning their brain to like </v>

1983
01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:11.260
<v Speaker 3>clone them or they're making like </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality types.</v>

1984
01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.633
<v Speaker 3>They're all fucking robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can just collect the semen and </v>

1985
01:33:14.381 --> 01:33:15.214
<v Speaker 3>cloned them there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause this like a huge seed bank that's </v>

1986
01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:19.144
<v Speaker 3>all westward as a huge semen bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the humans just get a bunch of </v>

1987
01:33:23.351 --> 01:33:24.640
<v Speaker 3>seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're not going to like,</v>

1988
01:33:24.650 --> 01:33:28.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you'd do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just get semen though.</v>

01:33:28.570 --> 01:33:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Get a bunch of semen dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I know.</v>

1990
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.490
<v Speaker 3>That would be really funny if </v>
<v Speaker 3>westworld's big request was like,</v>

1991
01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:36.970
<v Speaker 3>hey you have 30 kids we've been </v>

<v Speaker 3>know what to do with at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just have buckets of semen.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know they're like the vault with </v>

1996

1997
01:33:48.730 --> 01:33:49.563
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if it was just as big a swimming </v>

<v Speaker 3>A little bit too convoluted like to me,</v>

2006
01:34:29.021 --> 01:34:29.854
<v Speaker 3>like I saw season one and it was fun and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then like I heard I didn't even start </v>

2007
01:34:32.921 --> 01:34:33.754

2008
01:34:34.871 --> 01:34:35.770
<v Speaker 3>liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

2009
01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:38.230
<v Speaker 3>I just heard too many people going like,</v>

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:50.100
<v Speaker 3>watching like a handful of shows in </v>
<v Speaker 3>westworld is one of them because I,</v>

2014
01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:52.210
<v Speaker 3>I kind of don't give a shit what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

2015
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever they do,</v>

2020
01:35:02.301 --> 01:35:05.300
<v Speaker 1>trying to watch it high because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>already so hard to follow.</v>

2021
01:35:05.301 --> 01:35:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Like what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get panic attacks high anytime,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't have to watch any better sex.</v>

2023
01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:12.493
<v Speaker 1>I've never rewatch episodes of a TV show</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many times just to understand what </v>

2024
01:35:17.121 --> 01:35:19.160
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so complicated.</v>

2025
01:35:19.161 --> 01:35:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2026
01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:24.110

<v Speaker 1>It's like being that guy,</v>

2027

<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a little a pedal on us about the soul.</v>

2030
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:36.663
<v Speaker 1>The way that I washed it is like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that you understand what you're </v>

2031
01:35:41.931 --> 01:35:45.250
<v Speaker 1>supposed to and whatnot because no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a duck.</v>

2032
01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Can't try too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love game of thrones,</v>

2035
01:36:02.181 --> 01:36:05.870
<v Speaker 1>but I'll be damned if there were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>some characters whose names I forget and</v>

2036
01:36:05.871 --> 01:36:09.260
<v Speaker 1>when they pop up sometimes it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this big revelation of character pops up</v>

2037
01:36:09.261 --> 01:36:10.160
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but like sometimes I can like an asshole</v>

2041
01:36:19.330 --> 01:36:22.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's been that guy hitting your </v>

<v Speaker 1>You got to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's got an old guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's hard about it.</v>

2047
01:36:41.130 --> 01:36:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Anyone's complained about at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

2048
01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:47.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you on that one because like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people complain about that ending and it</v>

2049
01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:49.010
<v Speaker 1>being ambiguous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like wow.</v>

2050
01:36:49.011 --> 01:36:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many movies,</v>

2051
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:56.510
<v Speaker 1>but they're like layers in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the Ma to handle it.</v>

2052
01:36:57.230 --> 01:37:00.860
<v Speaker 1>It takes like two tries and you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like going into more dreams.</v>

2053
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2054
01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.660
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more drinks.</v>

2055
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:05.750
<v Speaker 1>It's entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well to be frank,</v>

2056
01:37:05.751 --> 01:37:10.751
<v Speaker 1>we do all have at least two 50 Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Iq is just the letters I in queue,</v>

2057
01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:17.050
<v Speaker 1>which could be worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am afraid to take an Iq test.</v>

2058
01:37:17.121 --> 01:37:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I cook can't face the reality that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably have like a 90.</v>

2059
01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.760
<v Speaker 1>You're not fucking night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have.</v>

2060
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:27.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I wrote the book,</v>

2061
01:37:29.630 --> 01:37:31.820
<v Speaker 1>grandparent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're um,</v>

2062
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:33.020
<v Speaker 1>you're not a 90 sign.</v>

2063
01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:34.790
<v Speaker 1>You're a one on one year one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.200
<v Speaker 1>you're award.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one to me,</v>

2065
01:37:36.201 --> 01:37:38.810
<v Speaker 1>even no matter what the doctors tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2066
01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.673
<v Speaker 1>barely over the mediocre threshold that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm really bad at like </v>

2067
01:37:42.261 --> 01:37:43.094
<v Speaker 1>pattern recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a lot of what the Iq is </v>

2068
01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.460
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2069
01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:47.913
<v Speaker 1>we did that escape room and me and Isla </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're set with the task of doing some </v>

2070
01:37:52.191 --> 01:37:57.191
<v Speaker 1>logic puzzle and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like I'm the dominant,</v>

2071
01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:59.473
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well escape rooms are different because </v>

2072
01:38:02.521 --> 01:38:03.354
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2073
01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:06.010
<v Speaker 1>they put you in a time constraint and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like doctors,</v>

2074
01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:13.050
<v Speaker 1>they're like social like with strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly strangers.</v>

2075
01:38:13.190 --> 01:38:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like friends of friends.</v>

2076
01:38:15.391 --> 01:38:17.520
<v Speaker 1>So we didn't know everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

2077
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:18.623
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot about myself in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape room in that like I'm kind of a </v>

2078
01:38:21.211 --> 01:38:25.130
<v Speaker 1>bitch like in a policy way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Far Away.</v>

2079
01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2080
01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:27.373
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had the puzzle figured out like I </v>

2081
01:38:29.101 --> 01:38:34.090
<v Speaker 1>was on my welfare and believe in myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had it.</v>

2082
01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:36.253
<v Speaker 1>I give like a broad stroke here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there were a bunch of books </v>

2083
01:38:38.761 --> 01:38:41.820
<v Speaker 1>sensitive genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that you set the books up is,</v>

2084
01:38:41.850 --> 01:38:45.670
<v Speaker 1>is the trick because there was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you used the flashlight and it's a black</v>

2085
01:38:45.671 --> 01:38:46.504
<v Speaker 1>light and you run it along the books and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tells you the combination for the </v>

2086
01:38:48.181 --> 01:38:49.014
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm over here playing with these </v>

2087
01:38:49.681 --> 01:38:50.490
<v Speaker 1>fucking books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2088
01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:51.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they should be like this,</v>

2089
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:54.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe they should be like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was starting to get there and then</v>

2090
01:38:54.751 --> 01:38:56.640
<v Speaker 1>someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone came over this,</v>

2091
01:38:56.670 --> 01:38:57.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2092
01:38:57.260 --> 01:39:00.660
<v Speaker 1>the like Alpha male of the group who I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know it was me.</v>

2093
01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Where are you wearing your soil boys?</v>

2094
01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Only on the inner side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2095
01:39:05.970 --> 01:39:07.860
<v Speaker 1>and then I was just playing with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

2096
01:39:07.861 --> 01:39:08.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give it a try,</v>

2097
01:39:08.851 --> 01:39:11.910
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just completely had it figured out.</v>

2098
01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:12.913
<v Speaker 1>I was probably three minutes away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out that I only know that </v>

2099
01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.590
<v Speaker 1>because this other guy came over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck them all up,</v>

2100
01:39:19.591 --> 01:39:21.330
<v Speaker 1>didn't know what he was doing and walked</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2101
01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:23.090
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

2102
01:39:23.170 --> 01:39:24.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an actor in the room.</v>

2103
01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:26.820
<v Speaker 1>So there was someone who was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>chained to the bed.</v>

2104
01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:29.000
<v Speaker 1>It was like a Zombie or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in a while.</v>

2105
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:30.090
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2106
01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:32.550
<v Speaker 1>like the rules were don't get near this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

2107
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.193
<v Speaker 1>don't touch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which means that someone's touched them </v>

2108
01:39:35.821 --> 01:39:37.920
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

2109
01:39:37.921 --> 01:39:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that it's a rule because </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone did it right.</v>

2110
01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she just like,</v>

2111
01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I could see her break character and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>exasperated and she walked over,</v>

2112
01:39:49.501 --> 01:39:54.501
<v Speaker 1>redid everything I did and set it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yelled at it like not with words,</v>

2113
01:39:54.601 --> 01:39:56.590
<v Speaker 1>just went and then like left the way.</v>

2114
01:39:57.330 --> 01:39:58.320
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2115
01:39:59.470 --> 01:40:00.660
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she solved it.</v>

2116
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:01.673
<v Speaker 1>She solved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she did what I did because you </v>

2117
01:40:08.161 --> 01:40:09.930
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audacity,</v>

2118
01:40:09.931 --> 01:40:12.330
<v Speaker 1>the courage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh I heard was her calling me a pussy.</v>

2119
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:13.410
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2120
01:40:13.411 --> 01:40:14.400
<v Speaker 1>that's got to fuck with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2121
01:40:14.401 --> 01:40:15.900
<v Speaker 1>That's got to fuck if you're with me a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

2122
01:40:15.901 --> 01:40:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was right about that.</v>

2123
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:21.930
<v Speaker 1>The confidence for the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to take the initiative and I was</v>

2124
01:40:21.931 --> 01:40:24.030
<v Speaker 1>wrong to every other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other,</v>

2125
01:40:26.210 --> 01:40:26.851
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2126
01:40:26.851 --> 01:40:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm the fucking genius at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that to fifth.</v>

2127
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:31.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just that one aspect that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2128
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Think the one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2129
01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this came from,</v>

2130
01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the social situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the social pressure.</v>

2131
01:40:38.730 --> 01:40:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I am not alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not outgoing and I'm not smart.</v>

2132
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:44.460
<v Speaker 1>So all those combined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a good time.</v>

2133
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:46.620
<v Speaker 1>All those combine trapped in a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

2134
01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I think you need to be with the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2135
01:40:48.481 --> 01:40:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Like a flashback to middle school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like doing,</v>

2136
01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear you.</v>

2137
01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I was not good at those tests Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2138
01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.233
<v Speaker 1>Mike is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to give us logic tests and </v>

2139
01:40:57.101 --> 01:40:59.170
<v Speaker 1>middle school and all these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>nerds would like,</v>

2140
01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:00.303
<v Speaker 1>they'll like if Beth had 12 cherries and</v>
<v Speaker 1>George punched her in the pussy and she </v>

2141
01:41:04.661 --> 01:41:08.250
<v Speaker 1>dropped to exactly what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're obviously,</v>

2142
01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:09.403
<v Speaker 1>well regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was not good at these and there </v>

2143
01:41:11.411 --> 01:41:13.660
<v Speaker 1>was like the really dumb people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2144
01:41:13.661 --> 01:41:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I beat them but that wasn't a feed but I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not head of the pack.</v>

2145
01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I honestly think if you're with like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people I know and like you like</v>

2146
01:41:22.391 --> 01:41:23.224
<v Speaker 1>you're cool with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not friends of friends of </v>

2147
01:41:24.521 --> 01:41:26.680
<v Speaker 1>friends are not like friends three times</v>
<v Speaker 1>removed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was just like pieces drawn together.</v>

2172
01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering what the Hell is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

2173
01:42:13.181 --> 01:42:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Your hair is popping on the top.</v>

<v Speaker 3>abstinence is the only way to prevent </v>

2415
01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:45.980
<v Speaker 3>aids counter to what Mark Walberg would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have you believe.</v>

2416
01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not just the Calvin's mark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

2417
01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:52.970
<v Speaker 3>But in the pursuit of Jesus's love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they not only waited to have sex,</v>

2418
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.180
<v Speaker 3>they waited until marriage to kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2419
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:57.103
<v Speaker 3>that sounds right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each other or anyone in general married </v>

2420
01:55:00.681 --> 01:55:04.160
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So did they go from not even kissing the</v>

2421
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:06.080
<v Speaker 3>two?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sticking it in.</v>

2422
01:55:06.110 --> 01:55:06.943
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm reading the waiting until </v>

2423
01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:10.850
<v Speaker 3>marriage to kiss isn't something you'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear much about from pop culture.</v>

2424
01:55:10.851 --> 01:55:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Although saving sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kissing,</v>

2425
01:55:12.681 --> 01:55:14.780
<v Speaker 3>or any other intimate act for marriage </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a rarity.</v>

2426
01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:15.793
<v Speaker 3>It can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what they're claiming to have </v>

2427
01:55:17.451 --> 01:55:18.140
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2428
01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:19.790
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait to see these nuts,</v>

2429
01:55:19.791 --> 01:55:20.624
<v Speaker 3>sex go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And today we are going to be talking </v>

2430

<v Speaker 3>dislike ratio.</v>

2435
01:55:40.581 --> 01:55:41.414

<v Speaker 3>My shifts have been a one time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>really loose nasty bowel movements and </v>

2611
02:03:34.810 --> 02:03:35.643
<v Speaker 3>lots of cleaning issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so my shits are like beautifully </v>

2612
02:03:38.631 --> 02:03:40.650

02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:46.960
<v Speaker 3>shipment to size and tact one piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>intact.</v>

2615
02:03:46.970 --> 02:03:47.803
<v Speaker 3>Like guys in my whole forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I haven't been having shits like </v>

2616
02:03:50.541 --> 02:03:51.860
<v Speaker 3>this since I was like 12.</v>

2617
02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:52.740
<v Speaker 3>What's the secret?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you,</v>

2618
02:03:52.970 --> 02:03:55.640
<v Speaker 3>how are you eating differently or you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a monster?</v>

2619
02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:57.690
<v Speaker 3>It's the antidepressant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it,</v>

2620
02:03:57.730 --> 02:03:58.563
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

2621
02:03:58.970 --> 02:04:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Metamucil anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do take the Metamucil,</v>

2622
02:04:00.951 --> 02:04:05.450
<v Speaker 3>but before I started the antidepressant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my shifts weren't that much better.</v>

2623
02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:06.793
<v Speaker 3>Like at least the form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I guess I guess the </v>

2624
02:04:09.231 --> 02:04:11.960
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant makes you constipated and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it even me out.</v>

2625
02:04:12.090 --> 02:04:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

2626
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:17.810
<v Speaker 3>I can shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like you had like an emergency break</v>

2627
02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:21.290
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing going on where like beyond</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2628
02:04:21.291 --> 02:04:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what like uh,</v>

2629
02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:24.990
<v Speaker 3>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a similar situation would need,</v>

2630
02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:25.853
<v Speaker 3>maybe they will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the negative effect was a </v>

2631
02:04:27.771 --> 02:04:28.490
<v Speaker 3>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2632
02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:29.323
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes I wonder if sometimes I </v>

2633
02:04:31.461 --> 02:04:32.294
<v Speaker 3>wonder if the antidepressant works at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all or if I'm just happy all the time </v>

2634
02:04:36.171 --> 02:04:37.710

<v Speaker 1>if we were alive a hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have died of dysentery,</v>

2649
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:29.590
<v Speaker 1>dysentery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You thought of that for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2655
02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:44.880

2656
02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:46.553
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2657
02:05:47.671 --> 02:05:48.950
<v Speaker 1>anywhere after playing that game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

2658
02:05:48.951 --> 02:05:51.050
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

2659
02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:51.893
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when games were on fucking </v>

2662
02:05:57.661 --> 02:05:59.430

<v Speaker 4>three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then a whole month over month.</v>

2987
02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:22.340
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just,</v>

2988
02:20:22.341 --> 02:20:24.410
<v Speaker 4>it's a hell of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just such a fun,</v>

2989
02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:27.110
<v Speaker 4>you walk everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unlike La,</v>

2990
02:20:27.111 --> 02:20:29.600
<v Speaker 4>you can't fucking walk anywhere in La </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you're in downtown,</v>

2991
02:20:29.601 --> 02:20:33.260
<v Speaker 4>but no ones in downtown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can walk anywhere in Philadelphia.</v>

2992
02:20:33.290 --> 02:20:35.750
<v Speaker 4>It's a very walkable city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so much to do.</v>

2993
02:20:35.751 --> 02:20:38.590
<v Speaker 4>We went out to dinner just about every </v>
<v Speaker 4>single,</v>

2994
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:40.730
<v Speaker 4>like a different place every night </v>
<v Speaker 4>because like,</v>

2995
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:42.560
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so much to do in Philly.</v>

2996
02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't seem to crossover with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>anecdote?</v>

2997
02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:46.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2998
02:20:46.251 --> 02:20:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I have plenty of good things to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Philadelphia,</v>

2999
02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:53.800
<v Speaker 1>but they're all after I left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of them happened while I lived in a</v>

3000
02:20:53.890 --> 02:20:55.970
<v Speaker 1>damn shame area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3001
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:58.400
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you like La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we moved out of there.</v>

3002
02:20:58.460 --> 02:21:01.700
<v Speaker 1>My parents moved us out of Philly when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 12,</v>

3003
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:03.590
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that because,</v>

3004
02:21:03.591 --> 02:21:04.424
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a gangster got shot outside of our </v>

3005
02:21:07.371 --> 02:21:10.370
<v Speaker 1>house or a mobster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrifying.</v>

3006
02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:13.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a Ma like Italian mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a rough neighborhood?</v>

3007
02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:15.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

3008
02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:16.153
<v Speaker 1>But there was FBI in some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartments that were like no shit </v>

3009
02:21:19.340 --> 02:21:21.800
<v Speaker 1>watching us because at the end of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>block,</v>

3010
02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:23.053
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in at fifth and Katherine in </v>

3011
02:21:25.221 --> 02:21:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3012
02:21:28.861 --> 02:21:33.090
<v Speaker 1>a takeover of the mob scene at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Guy Joey Morlino.</v>

3013
02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:34.033
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3014
02:21:34.130 --> 02:21:36.020
<v Speaker 1>And this other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chink Illini,</v>

3015
02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:37.533
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shingle Leni had an older brother </v>

3016
02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:44.600
<v Speaker 1>who was with the current heads of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the mob.</v>

3017
02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:45.913
<v Speaker 1>And so these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these younger boys put out a hit on the </v>

3018
02:21:48.051 --> 02:21:49.970
<v Speaker 1>older brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got shot,</v>

3019
02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:50.953
<v Speaker 1>went to a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hospital was where my father worked </v>

3020
02:21:53.541 --> 02:21:54.374
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these guys put the hit out from </v>

3021
02:21:57.380 --> 02:21:59.660
<v Speaker 1>apparently the end of the block where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived on.</v>

3022
02:21:59.661 --> 02:22:02.210
<v Speaker 1>So my dad's over here at this hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bring in Alenia.</v>

3023
02:22:02.211 --> 02:22:04.100
<v Speaker 1>It's always like we're mobsters in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallway and shit.</v>

3024
02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:05.540
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3025
02:22:06.860 --> 02:22:07.693
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile at my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom has somebody like a patient over </v>

3026
02:22:11.091 --> 02:22:15.140
<v Speaker 1>that she's talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in retaliation for the hit to put</v>

3027
02:22:15.141 --> 02:22:19.820
<v Speaker 1>that guy in the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come over and just start firing at,</v>

3028
02:22:20.010 --> 02:22:20.843
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys at the end of the block who by </v>

3029
02:22:22.461 --> 02:22:24.380
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be a green piece.</v>

3030
02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:26.970
<v Speaker 1>And then this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3031
02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.790
<v Speaker 1>junior mafia took over and they turn it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into an exterminators,</v>

3032
02:22:30.450 --> 02:22:32.640
<v Speaker 1>which is I think one of the funniest </v>
<v Speaker 1>reversals,</v>

3033
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess a classic comedy reversal right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3034
02:22:35.930 --> 02:22:37.890
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shot the shit out of these guys.</v>

3035
02:22:37.891 --> 02:22:38.211
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

3036
02:22:38.211 --> 02:22:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Alina got shot in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of people died on your street.</v>

3037
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:44.610
<v Speaker 1>One person died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3038
02:22:44.670 --> 02:22:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it was tingling and his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this younger guy died.</v>

3039
02:22:49.890 --> 02:22:51.600
<v Speaker 1>And then this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3040
02:22:51.601 --> 02:22:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a wikipedia article for this,</v>

3041
02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:58.530
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make the whole thing wrong.</v>

3042
02:22:58.790 --> 02:23:02.120
<v Speaker 1>That just makes like that part wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This escalate the shingle,</v>

3043
02:23:02.121 --> 02:23:03.420
<v Speaker 1>ng war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3044
02:23:03.421 --> 02:23:06.390
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty much over it because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just like,</v>

3045
02:23:06.391 --> 02:23:07.224
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as far as like I was concerned </v>

3046
02:23:09.241 --> 02:23:11.480
<v Speaker 1>or my family was concerned because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3047
02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I think our house was already on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>market when that happened.</v>

3048
02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:14.693
<v Speaker 1>But once that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really put a fire under my parents </v>

3049
02:23:16.921 --> 02:23:17.754
<v Speaker 1>asked to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of their trouble </v>

3050
02:23:20.371 --> 02:23:21.690
<v Speaker 1>selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that happened.</v>

3051
02:23:21.930 --> 02:23:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now if you go to that neighborhood,</v>

3052
02:23:24.991 --> 02:23:28.590
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the time it was just these,</v>

3053
02:23:29.220 --> 02:23:30.710
<v Speaker 1>these fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3054
02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:33.540
<v Speaker 1>got moocs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a word?</v>

3055
02:23:33.810 --> 02:23:34.800
<v Speaker 1>It is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3056
02:23:34.830 --> 02:23:37.170
<v Speaker 1>He's got Moocs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silver on the end of the street.</v>

3057
02:23:37.171 --> 02:23:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It get the fucking exterminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones getting exterminated.</v>

3058
02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:42.713
<v Speaker 1>I realized how I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I realized how good </v>

3059
02:23:43.961 --> 02:23:46.260
<v Speaker 1>fellows Merlino was in fucking prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

3060
02:23:46.290 --> 02:23:47.610
<v Speaker 1>They found him as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

3061
02:23:47.611 --> 02:23:50.070
<v Speaker 1>as high profile as this guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

3062
02:23:50.071 --> 02:23:52.200
<v Speaker 1>He was like limping away with a bullet </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his ass.</v>

3063
02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:53.393
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found him under someone's bed when </v>

3064
02:23:55.231 --> 02:23:58.110
<v Speaker 1>they were coming to arrest them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember that from the news.</v>

3065
02:23:58.410 --> 02:24:02.310
<v Speaker 1>They kicked someone's door and there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>this movie going to be right.</v>

3066

<v Speaker 1>Glad they use bullets in that movie </v>

3069
02:24:13.291 --> 02:24:14.610
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From your perspective,</v>

3070
02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:15.833
<v Speaker 1>my perspective would be like an eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old comes home and they're loading </v>

3071
02:24:18.331 --> 02:24:21.180
<v Speaker 1>a body into an ambulance and the eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>year olds like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still got an Nintendo.</v>

<v Speaker 1>A dead body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>

3101
02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:34.753
<v Speaker 3>Let's all check our phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we have notes from my notes from my </v>

3102
02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:38.080
<v Speaker 3>parents?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents,</v>

3103
02:25:38.081 --> 02:25:40.840
<v Speaker 3>usually they do have something to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>every once in a while.</v>

3104
02:25:41.170 --> 02:25:43.780
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have anything from your parents.</v>

3105
02:25:43.781 --> 02:25:47.980
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do have a quick summary of answers for</v>

3106
02:25:47.981 --> 02:25:51.100
<v Speaker 3>all of the furry questions we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier in the episode.</v>

3107
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:53.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pooped.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just returned from a walk.</v>

3110
02:25:58.991 --> 02:26:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Shredder pooped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to feed him now.</v>

3111
02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:02.830
<v Speaker 3>Do you guys use the APP?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really exciting.</v>

3112
02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.930
<v Speaker 3>The Dog Walker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom,</v>

3113
02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:07.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's way better.</v>

3114
02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:08.493
<v Speaker 3>We love shutter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me about the firies if you would </v>

3115
02:26:11.021 --> 02:26:11.500
<v Speaker 3>please.</v>

3116
02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:12.041
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3117
02:26:12.041 --> 02:26:13.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3118
02:26:13.170 --> 02:26:17.440
<v Speaker 3>a gentleman with a little furry avatar </v>
<v Speaker 3>named Dan reached out.</v>

3119
02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan.</v>

3120
02:26:20.050 --> 02:26:20.883
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just some real simple bullet pointed </v>

3121
02:26:23.141 --> 02:26:24.100
<v Speaker 3>answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's furries.</v>

3122
02:26:24.130 --> 02:26:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or like any fandom,</v>

3123
02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:26.913
<v Speaker 3>the way I like to think about is </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically saying that furries are all </v>

3124
02:26:28.811 --> 02:26:32.800
<v Speaker 3>about sex is like saying everyone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>watches anime like Hentai.</v>

3125
02:26:32.801 --> 02:26:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>

3126
02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me put a stop.</v>

3127
02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:41.040
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fandom of what furries sand them of you.</v>

3128
02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:51.510
<v Speaker 3>I think his point is just saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a diverse,</v>

3129
02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:52.433
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fandom there in that it's not a </v>

3130
02:26:53.501 --> 02:26:55.990
<v Speaker 3>monolith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are different sex in it,</v>

3131
02:26:55.991 --> 02:27:00.991
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is being a furry putting on a suit?</v>

3132
02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Like where does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that seems like an extreme.</v>

3133
02:27:03.491 --> 02:27:07.160
<v Speaker 3>So where does furry is him start?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the light for a minute.</v>

3134
02:27:07.810 --> 02:27:10.930
<v Speaker 3>I think the suit is a requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's kind of the baseline.</v>

3135
02:27:11.380 --> 02:27:13.060
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an extreme.</v>

3136
02:27:13.690 --> 02:27:14.523
<v Speaker 3>That's not like watching anime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's getting an a suit and going </v>

3137
02:27:16.481 --> 02:27:18.100
<v Speaker 3>meeting people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3138
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:19.280
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

3139
02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:20.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he addresses that.</v>

3140
02:27:20.201 --> 02:27:21.580
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3141
02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:22.750
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>furry people,</v>

3142
02:27:22.751 --> 02:27:23.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

3143
02:27:23.770 --> 02:27:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carry it.</v>

3144
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:30.990
<v Speaker 3>It's an unusual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three people I know and I,</v>

3145
02:27:31.361 --> 02:27:33.630
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are,</v>

3146
02:27:33.770 --> 02:27:38.770
<v Speaker 3>but I do have a 250 Iq and I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress my massive intellect.</v>

3147
02:27:39.940 --> 02:27:41.440
<v Speaker 3>What's it like up there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That view.</v>

3148
02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:42.670
<v Speaker 3>So go ahead please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Down.</v>

3149
02:27:43.090 --> 02:27:43.923
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he says he does agree many fursuits </v>

3150
02:27:46.390 --> 02:27:50.830
<v Speaker 3>of specially the faces and eyes are </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely kind of creepy or off in some</v>

3151
02:27:50.831 --> 02:27:51.664
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're super expensive and the </v>

3152
02:27:53.651 --> 02:27:56.200
<v Speaker 3>nicer they are the price here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3153
02:27:56.201 --> 02:27:57.910
<v Speaker 3>so I guess he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3154
02:27:57.911 --> 02:27:59.440
<v Speaker 3>the cheap ones are going to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>creepier.</v>

3155
02:27:59.910 --> 02:28:03.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just an uncanny thing cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a Fox humanoid,</v>

3156
02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Eh got pleased Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could put if you yeah,</v>

3157
02:28:07.310 --> 02:28:08.200
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

3158
02:28:08.201 --> 02:28:09.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says on that note,</v>

3159
02:28:09.821 --> 02:28:11.950
<v Speaker 3>since they're so expensive and hard to </v>
<v Speaker 3>clean,</v>

3160
02:28:11.951 --> 02:28:13.430
<v Speaker 3>most people who own them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>

3161
02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:15.410
<v Speaker 3>kids may not have sex in them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3162
02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:16.293
<v Speaker 3>There are even some drama in the past </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people were saying that those who </v>

3163
02:28:19.331 --> 02:28:21.860
<v Speaker 3>do have sex in their suits shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>them in public.</v>

3164
02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who knows how that argument ended.</v>

3165
02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:26.480
<v Speaker 1>So a Mongol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many,</v>

3166
02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:28.653
<v Speaker 1>so how many fandoms are there arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst themselves about wearing their </v>

3167
02:28:34.251 --> 02:28:36.290
<v Speaker 1>suits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having sex in their suits?</v>

3168
02:28:36.470 --> 02:28:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Like it's clearly a part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely an aspect that she's not</v>

3169
02:28:41.271 --> 02:28:43.760
<v Speaker 1>denying that comes suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would want to come,</v>

3170
02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:46.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a come spent all this money on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>suit.</v>

3171
02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just go over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3172
02:28:48.350 --> 02:28:49.820
<v Speaker 1>you're a funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to mark your territory?</v>

3173
02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

3174
02:28:50.450 --> 02:28:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I think the animate comparison is apt in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's saying,</v>

3175
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:56.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like myself,</v>

3176
02:28:56.331 --> 02:28:57.164
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy anime but I'm not into the </v>

3177
02:28:58.491 --> 02:29:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Hentai aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like,</v>

3178
02:29:00.981 --> 02:29:03.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a subculture within a subculture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3179
02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:07.550
<v Speaker 1>The people that are that it's super </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual for within the furry community.</v>

3180
02:29:07.730 --> 02:29:10.070
<v Speaker 1>That's just one section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3181
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

3182
02:29:12.231 --> 02:29:13.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he says a bad dream.</v>

3183
02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:15.343
<v Speaker 1>This is a different person also talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about bad dragon is basically a website </v>

3184
02:29:18.081 --> 02:29:21.110
<v Speaker 1>that makes weird sex toys more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly marketed towards furries.</v>

3185
02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Those wearable things are basically like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dildo that goes around your deck.</v>

3186
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:26.690
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't get any,</v>

3187
02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:28.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get any physical,</v>

3188
02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:29.593
<v Speaker 1>well I guess the person wearing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't cause the debt is way fucking </v>

3189
02:29:32.601 --> 02:29:35.990
<v Speaker 1>nicer than your own others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can get electrodes.</v>

3190
02:29:36.410 --> 02:29:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Does it just give you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

3191
02:29:39.771 --> 02:29:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I've got a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a prop deck that it's show,</v>

3192
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:45.230
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a creature from shape of </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

3193
02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

3194
02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3195
02:29:48.441 --> 02:29:51.680
<v Speaker 1>I just shocked at myself in the deck </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it on and film it for fiber.</v>

3196
02:29:53.380 --> 02:29:55.820
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interestingly,</v>

3197
02:29:55.821 --> 02:29:56.654
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've killed a couple people with it and </v>

3198
02:29:59.511 --> 02:30:00.344
<v Speaker 1>so the bad dragon is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a penis modification that looks at </v>

3199
02:30:03.921 --> 02:30:04.850
<v Speaker 1>like an animals.</v>

3200
02:30:04.940 --> 02:30:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad dragon,</v>

3201
02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's just a website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a website is sold.</v>

3202
02:30:09.111 --> 02:30:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Various different antibiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a good check it out of your own.</v>

3203
02:30:12.771 --> 02:30:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Tiny little pathetic human penis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for those of you at home,</v>

3204
02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:18.380
<v Speaker 1>the bad dragon.com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan will love that.</v>

3205
02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3206
02:30:19.340 --> 02:30:20.173
<v Speaker 1>his final point here is that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who likes furries really buys </v>

3207
02:30:23.571 --> 02:30:26.390
<v Speaker 1>into the fandom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people really live it like with any</v>

3208
02:30:26.391 --> 02:30:27.224
<v Speaker 1>fandom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people just like it and don't </v>

3209
02:30:28.581 --> 02:30:30.260
<v Speaker 1>really go to conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do that?</v>

3210
02:30:30.680 --> 02:30:31.513
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they fans of dressing up is </v>

3211
02:30:32.961 --> 02:30:34.290
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3212
02:30:35.330 --> 02:30:36.440
<v Speaker 1>cosplay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosplay,</v>

3213
02:30:38.270 --> 02:30:39.350
<v Speaker 1>cosplay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosplay.</v>

3214
02:30:39.470 --> 02:30:40.303
<v Speaker 1>But it was play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm missing is I feel like there's </v>

3215
02:30:42.111 --> 02:30:42.944
<v Speaker 1>an Oregon cozy play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's an origin to this </v>

3216
02:30:46.431 --> 02:30:48.970
<v Speaker 1>that we're not understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got your point.</v>

3217
02:30:48.990 --> 02:30:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the origin?</v>

3218
02:30:50.421 --> 02:30:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Where does it come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be cosplaying.</v>

3219
02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Like how did people decide that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved dressing up like foxes?</v>

3220
02:30:57.260 --> 02:31:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the origin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be a show or a TV.</v>

3221
02:31:02.660 --> 02:31:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3222
02:31:06.540 --> 02:31:07.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the first piece of entertainment </v>

3223
02:31:09.171 --> 02:31:14.090
<v Speaker 1>where the main character was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropomorphic animal?</v>

3224
02:31:14.091 --> 02:31:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Felix the cat.</v>

3225
02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:18.470
<v Speaker 1>It was a winnie the Pooh and just him </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around without no pants.</v>

3226
02:31:18.590 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Mickey had a lot of people were like,</v>

3227
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:20.813
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

3228
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:23.590
<v Speaker 3>I want to know the origin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the big next too.</v>

3229
02:31:23.591 --> 02:31:25.400
<v Speaker 3>Because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3230
02:31:25.450 --> 02:31:27.640
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3231
02:31:27.641 --> 02:31:30.310
<v Speaker 3>it's all animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like it seems,</v>

3232
02:31:30.350 --> 02:31:32.790
<v Speaker 3>and I could be wrong about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like 80% of that,</v>

3233
02:31:32.810 --> 02:31:33.780
<v Speaker 3>it's all foxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3234
02:31:33.810 --> 02:31:36.640
<v Speaker 3>It's all foxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's something going on there.</v>

3235
02:31:36.670 --> 02:31:41.110
<v Speaker 3>We'll foxes are sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the sexier animals.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3237
02:31:41.441 --> 02:31:42.550

3240
02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:46.730
<v Speaker 4>You look at a Fox and try not to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>horny.</v>

3241
02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:50.690
<v Speaker 4>What's the sexiest Fox though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the one from the Fox and the hound.</v>

3242
02:31:50.691 --> 02:31:52.070
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am I thinking of?</v>

3243
02:31:52.280 --> 02:31:53.113
<v Speaker 4>Disney?</v>

3244

3246
02:31:58.350 --> 02:32:00.960
<v Speaker 4>That's like one of those old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like from the 60s animated.</v>

3247
02:32:00.961 --> 02:32:03.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm classics of Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Fox and the hound.</v>

<v Speaker 4>tramp and lady and the lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3252
02:32:09.631 --> 02:32:10.464
<v Speaker 4>More of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there are any foxes in </v>

3253
02:32:11.491 --> 02:32:12.324
<v Speaker 4>that movie.</v>

3254
02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:16.110
<v Speaker 3>I would come on the trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know the,</v>

3255
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:18.600
<v Speaker 3>the tramp would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that not a dry,</v>

3256
02:32:18.601 --> 02:32:22.170
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to get him back to like a skank</v>

3257
02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:24.610
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it used to mean something different.</v>

3258
02:32:24.611 --> 02:32:25.151
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3259
02:32:25.151 --> 02:32:25.984
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3260
02:32:26.110 --> 02:32:26.943
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlie Chaplin played the lovable </v>

3261
02:32:30.190 --> 02:32:31.023
<v Speaker 4>tramp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like his character was a tramp and it </v>

3262
02:32:32.891 --> 02:32:36.250
<v Speaker 4>was just kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it meant something different back in the</v>

3263
02:32:36.250 --> 02:32:37.330
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I sit back in the day,</v>

3264
02:32:37.331 --> 02:32:40.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean like in the fucking 20s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30s,</v>

3265
02:32:40.001 --> 02:32:42.190
<v Speaker 4>I apologize if that's not quite the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right timeline,</v>

3266
02:32:42.191 --> 02:32:42.700
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3267
02:32:42.700 --> 02:32:43.750
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it used to mean something.</v>

3268
02:32:43.751 --> 02:32:47.080
<v Speaker 4>So lady and the tramp did not mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it was lady,</v>

3269
02:32:47.410 --> 02:32:49.990
<v Speaker 4>the lady dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then tramp was like this homeless,</v>

3270
02:32:49.991 --> 02:32:52.360
<v Speaker 4>kind of like a vagabond and little guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3271
02:32:52.370 --> 02:32:53.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3272
02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:55.240
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it meant something different.</v>

3273
02:32:55.241 --> 02:32:57.080
<v Speaker 4>So today in today's standard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3274
02:32:57.100 --> 02:32:57.933
<v Speaker 4>tramp stamp,</v>

3275
02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:00.930
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3276

<v Speaker 3>The furry fandom is a subculture </v>

<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's make it the three.</v>

3369
02:37:03.130 --> 02:37:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rewind itself,</v>

3370
02:37:04.750 --> 02:37:09.000
<v Speaker 1>but next year I really want to see an h </v>

<v Speaker 3>The name is kind of too good to pass on.</v>

3378
02:37:31.230 --> 02:37:32.063
<v Speaker 3>That is a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be like everyone who slipped </v>

3379
02:37:33.861 --> 02:37:34.694
<v Speaker 3>up and said the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll happily say the outward getting </v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll do a quick roll.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying I want to put it out </v>

3383
02:37:53.031 --> 02:37:55.010

3384
02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:55.903
<v Speaker 3>Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looks like he wants to make that n word </v>

<v Speaker 3>cut right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk.</v>

02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:02.300
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's wrap.</v>

3387
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:04.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm sober Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3388
02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:07.993
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each three wine 2019 youtube can make </v>

3389
02:38:11.541 --> 02:38:12.374
<v Speaker 3>whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to make something weird </v>

3390
02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:16.153
<v Speaker 3>that's a really good hitters to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain demographic that they're happy </v>

3391
02:38:18.711 --> 02:38:20.950
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just everyone the same date.</v>

3392
02:38:21.770 --> 02:38:22.610
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3393
02:38:24.650 --> 02:38:26.240
<v Speaker 3>When it comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3394
02:38:26.241 --> 02:38:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there,</v>

3395
02:38:27.441 --> 02:38:29.750
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be some method to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>madness.</v>

3396
02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:30.673
<v Speaker 3>Here's my reason for wanting this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like so many people seem to give a </v>

3397
02:38:33.861 --> 02:38:34.694
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3398
02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you,</v>

3399
02:38:36.350 --> 02:38:40.520
<v Speaker 3>why do you honestly fucking care what </v>
<v Speaker 3>this website makes?</v>

3400
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:42.560
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you exactly why.</v>

3401
02:38:44.930 --> 02:38:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Because it affects us all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Eric.</v>

3402
02:38:47.290 --> 02:38:48.123
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It affects,</v>

3403
02:38:48.700 --> 02:38:51.070
<v Speaker 3>and if it looks bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

3404
02:38:51.410 --> 02:38:55.510
<v Speaker 3>it looks bad to all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of like,</v>

3405
02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:57.390
<v Speaker 3>was it like 10 million dislikes or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3406
02:38:57.391 --> 02:38:58.224
<v Speaker 3>It turned into a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really let them make whatever the hell </v>

3407
02:39:02.841 --> 02:39:05.420
<v Speaker 3>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think the,</v>

3408
02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:07.010
<v Speaker 3>it's hard not to care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why.</v>

3409
02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:07.913
<v Speaker 3>It's just the burden of making a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>one should not be on them because </v>

3410
02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:14.060
<v Speaker 3>clearly they're not in the only thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They dropped the ball.</v>

3411
02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:17.330
<v Speaker 3>The burden of making it go and she'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it requires a lot of resources,</v>

3412
02:39:17.331 --> 02:39:19.220
<v Speaker 3>a lot of coordinating that you can do.</v>

3413
02:39:19.220 --> 02:39:22.280
<v Speaker 3>I can't get like I can't get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it year round,</v>

3414
02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:25.760
<v Speaker 3>year round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime you get a guest on the podcast,</v>

3415
02:39:25.970 --> 02:39:26.950
<v Speaker 3>get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3416
02:39:27.700 --> 02:39:30.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to veto that.</v>

3417
02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:34.280
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be at the end of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

3418
02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:35.233
<v Speaker 3>Like I see what you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's gotta be like a lot of annual </v>

3419
02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:40.580
<v Speaker 3>thing I think to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3420
02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:41.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3421
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:43.070
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric,</v>

3422
02:39:43.490 --> 02:39:46.160
<v Speaker 3>and I'm really stressed out already just</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it.</v>

3423
02:39:46.161 --> 02:39:49.610
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3424
02:39:49.611 --> 02:39:50.444
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not to say all be all or anything </v>

3425
02:39:53.211 --> 02:39:57.020
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a go,</v>

3426
02:39:57.050 --> 02:39:59.660
<v Speaker 3>let's make a poll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3427
02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:01.370
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3429
02:40:04.941 --> 02:40:06.090

<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

3430
02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:11.530
<v Speaker 3>But I don't have a catchy name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

3431
02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:13.830
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the youtube,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Ace three threes,</v>

3434
02:40:20.100 --> 02:40:22.750
<v Speaker 1>even like a backwards z.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to think of one.</v>

3435
02:40:22.751 --> 02:40:27.480
<v Speaker 1>If it's the he whined the he wine baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the h three one.</v>

3436

<v Speaker 1>I wish I could if I wish I could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>

3437
02:40:32.170 --> 02:40:32.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would yours be,</v>

3438
02:40:32.941 --> 02:40:34.590

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3439
02:40:34.650 --> 02:40:35.483
<v Speaker 1>it would start with will smith Gallia </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like a really poorly done g </v>

3440
02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:46.200
<v Speaker 1>version of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it melts into a puddle and then</v>

3441
02:40:46.201 --> 02:40:47.034
<v Speaker 1>in the puddle you see the planet Nibiru </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming around the sun and then it soaks </v>

3442
02:40:51.301 --> 02:40:54.390
<v Speaker 1>up all the oceans of earth of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is you.</v>

3443
02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:56.430
<v Speaker 1>This is totally off the cuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3444
02:40:56.460 --> 02:40:58.650
<v Speaker 1>and then what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>

3445
02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bannon is riding one of those </v>

02:46:52.450 --> 02:46:54.410
<v Speaker 1>well what do we all just singing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing?</v>

3562
02:46:54.411 --> 02:46:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Tried to impress will Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this what you wanted?</v>

3563
02:46:57.021 --> 02:46:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

3564
02:46:57.380 --> 02:47:00.440
<v Speaker 4>apparently according to Marcus Brownley </v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3565
02:47:00.441 --> 02:47:01.274
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shot like hours of footage for </v>

3566
02:47:03.021 --> 02:47:03.854
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But of course you only see like mere </v>

3567
02:47:05.061 --> 02:47:05.894
<v Speaker 4>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like I think they had a lot of </v>

3568
02:47:06.561 --> 02:47:07.394
<v Speaker 4>different options,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are the charters were you in last </v>

3569
02:47:09.860 --> 02:47:11.420
<v Speaker 4>years I was in line or in the dance </v>
<v Speaker 4>scene,</v>

3570
02:47:11.421 --> 02:47:12.254
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3571
02:47:13.070 --> 02:47:15.110
<v Speaker 4>There was like a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you,</v>

3572
02:47:15.290 --> 02:47:16.123
<v Speaker 4>did you know going in two years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two years ago there was like a frame of </v>

3573
02:47:19.401 --> 02:47:22.430
<v Speaker 4>me last year there was a slight smidge </v>
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

3574
02:47:22.431 --> 02:47:23.264
<v Speaker 4>I think I remember seeing two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not know I would be like that cut </v>

3575
02:47:26.391 --> 02:47:28.780
<v Speaker 4>out of it two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no fucking clue I had no,</v>

3576
02:47:29.090 --> 02:47:29.923
<v Speaker 4>it's just one of those like you're there</v>
<v Speaker 4>all day and make the most of it and you </v>

3577
02:47:31.911 --> 02:47:35.120
<v Speaker 4>hope and you pray that some smidge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you makes it into the final cut.</v>

3578
02:47:35.330 --> 02:47:36.163
<v Speaker 4>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they never guarantee it until like </v>

3579
02:47:37.971 --> 02:47:39.380
<v Speaker 4>the day of fucking comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3580
02:47:39.381 --> 02:47:41.110
<v Speaker 4>Because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have editors and they have notes.</v>

3581
02:47:41.111 --> 02:47:41.944
<v Speaker 4>They have producers.</v>

3582
02:47:42.170 --> 02:47:43.003
<v Speaker 1>So many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they're very brand focused with </v>

3583
02:47:47.261 --> 02:47:47.750
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing.</v>

3584
02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:51.110
<v Speaker 4>The entire thing is an advertisement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is to advertisers.</v>

3585
02:47:51.140 --> 02:47:54.260
<v Speaker 4>It's the show how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how safe we are healing.</v>

3586
02:47:54.261 --> 02:47:54.740
<v Speaker 4>We are,</v>

3587
02:47:54.740 --> 02:47:56.000
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

3588
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:57.380
<v Speaker 1>oh my God will smith.</v>

3589
02:47:58.300 --> 02:47:59.440
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so like,</v>

3590
02:47:59.441 --> 02:48:00.190
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone,</v>

3591
02:48:00.190 --> 02:48:02.620
<v Speaker 4>myself included,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made fun of Youtube rewind for like,</v>

3592
02:48:02.650 --> 02:48:03.483
<v Speaker 4>Oh will smith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's my favorite youtube pause for </v>

3593
02:48:06.101 --> 02:48:08.830
<v Speaker 4>laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time it's very appealing</v>

3594
02:48:08.831 --> 02:48:13.831
<v Speaker 4>to see this triple a list or Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 4>star in this thing because that's all it</v>

3595
02:48:14.051 --> 02:48:14.771
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an,</v>

3596
02:48:14.771 --> 02:48:17.650
<v Speaker 4>it's an advertisement and I can't fault </v>
<v Speaker 4>Youtube rewind reporter lay for that.</v>

3597
02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean they got to do what they gotta do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all I'm saying.</v>

3598
02:48:21.540 --> 02:48:25.130
<v Speaker 1>And as long as people don't expect </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything better.</v>

3599
02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:27.193
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I feel like they have a seat of </v>

3600
02:48:29.931 --> 02:48:32.960
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy person because this thing came out</v>

3601
02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:35.630
<v Speaker 1>and everybody hated it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

3602
02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:39.620
<v Speaker 1>you shocked you fucking surprise this.</v>

3603
02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:40.993
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's because these two pointed out in </v>

3604
02:48:43.001 --> 02:48:43.834
<v Speaker 4>your excellent recap video that youtube </v>
<v Speaker 4>rewind wasn't always this totally </v>

3605
02:48:47.951 --> 02:48:49.450
<v Speaker 4>hateable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

3606
02:48:49.451 --> 02:48:50.284
<v Speaker 4>it used to be quite likable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny that I'm diving into being a </v>

3607
02:48:54.191 --> 02:48:56.200
<v Speaker 4>complete asshole here because I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>always said,</v>

<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3609
02:48:56.620 --> 02:49:00.130
<v Speaker 4>it's not you being an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just you'd be in fucking ignorant.</v>

3610

3611
02:49:05.741 --> 02:49:07.890
<v Speaker 4>press kit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just the fucking way to show</v>

3612
02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:09.550
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3613
02:49:11.110 --> 02:49:13.410

<v Speaker 1>you've been on set before.</v>

3614
02:49:13.780 --> 02:49:17.010
<v Speaker 1>It's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking nonsense thing.</v>

3615
02:49:17.011 --> 02:49:19.050
<v Speaker 1>If you watch it and you're not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>investor,</v>

3616
02:49:19.370 --> 02:49:24.210
<v Speaker 1>you're wasting as well.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got everybody,</v>

3618
02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:26.880
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't though.</v>

3619
02:49:26.881 --> 02:49:30.120
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get a lot of people that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not like funny or entertaining.</v>

3620
02:49:30.300 --> 02:49:34.260
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get a lot of key players </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like Shane Dawson for example,</v>

3621
02:49:34.261 --> 02:49:39.261
