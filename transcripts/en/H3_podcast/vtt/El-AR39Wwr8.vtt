00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>I am sick as a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my beautiful pregnant wife who I</v>

5
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>love and adore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the angel of my life and the light</v>

6
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's everything that I've ever hoped to</v>

7
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>find in a partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so much more.</v>

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>We look like I am so sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm delirious.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I am so sick.</v>

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.423
<v Speaker 1>I am completely out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been pumped with all the quills </v>

<v Speaker 1>and dayquil?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to share this special day with</v>

28
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>you all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>we had Tom Segura and Christina P,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of my favorite people on the planet.</v>

30
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>We're scheduled with her on Wednesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sick.</v>

31
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.503
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get him back on here </v>

32
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I love those guys.</v>

33
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Went to Disney yesterday with my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which made my illness worse.</v>

34
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.693
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.563
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's enough about what's going on in </v>

36
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:42.684
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get to the science of why we're </v>

37
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>all here today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last week.</v>

38
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.283
<v Speaker 1>And it's been part of the show mythology</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is we have these twitter </v>

39
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really illuminating,</v>

40
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I would say some of the darker parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our society.</v>

41
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Not Dark and the sense of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>being unethical or something to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>feared.</v>

43
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:05.964
<v Speaker 1>But I'm on dark in the shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the shadows in that it hasn't yet </v>

44
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>been uncovered or looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>

45
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.493
<v Speaker 1>we are great searchers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just great discovers we are </v>

46
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>pranksters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do like social experiments.</v>

47
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.000
<v Speaker 1>This is real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do it.</v>

48
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.933
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised to see some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these twitter polls being quoted and </v>

49
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.043
<v Speaker 1>such reputable articles as wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had one last week about do you </v>

50
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>smell on your hand and you fart on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and smell it.</v>

51
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm so out of it.</v>

52
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you fart on your hand and smell it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first we did.</v>

53
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you like the smell of your own farts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and most overwhelming,</v>

54
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

55
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:54.654
<v Speaker 1>And there were some naysayers like I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of upset because I feel you're </v>

56
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're saying that you're serious,</v>

57
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's like you're kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>the Paul speaks for itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

59
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>there was some disbelief that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked the smell of their own farts.</v>

60
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>But then we took it a step further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We said,</v>

61
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.313
<v Speaker 1>do you fart on your hand and smell it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of the people in here except </v>

62
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>for Zack is the only honest being here </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

63
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:19.550
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

64
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethan,</v>

65
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't exist.</v>

66
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:25.144
<v Speaker 1>They say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's go to this pole because this </v>

67
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.044
<v Speaker 1>was a prolific vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say this was a paramount </v>

68
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>benchmark vault we took place here.</v>

69
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever smart farted on your hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and smelled it?</v>

70
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>124,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>votes.</v>

71
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>That is a huge number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let me say 51%.</v>

72
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after this poll,</v>

73
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:49.954
<v Speaker 1>I bet you it's going to go even higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even saw a capo on when we were at </v>

74
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland and the guy had to tell me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he does it too.</v>

75
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually it was golf and I said,</v>

76
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.720
<v Speaker 1>can I smell your hand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Snooze,</v>

77
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.563
<v Speaker 1>I sniffed his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a Turkey leg in it and it was a </v>

78
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>fart in a curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a great time.</v>

79
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:14.370
<v Speaker 1>We had their Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there you have it guys.</v>

81
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>This is science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is real science we're doing here on</v>

82
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:22.340
<v Speaker 1>the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

83
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.080
<v Speaker 1>but then so I got an email from a fan </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts@hdsreproductions.com</v>

84
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.560
<v Speaker 1>and she blew my ass out with a new one </v>
<v Speaker 1>she wanted to broach with us.</v>

85
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.770
<v Speaker 1>So let me read this email from autumn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autumn g Hello Ethan.</v>

86
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:44.104
<v Speaker 1>And Ila lately on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys been talking about your gross </v>

87
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.224
<v Speaker 1>habits and Isla almost every time has </v>
<v Speaker 1>said she does not share these strange </v>

88
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:50.614
<v Speaker 1>routines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as it yield Kleiner I had met when </v>

89
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my cycle I will often smell my </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>

90
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.933
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I find it satisfying and </v>

91
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:00.934
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I find it gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lately my blood has smelled similar to </v>

92
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>red wine and I've never smelled my blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's in a,</v>

93
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.783
<v Speaker 1>oh she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I never smell my blood when it's in </v>

94
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>a Tampon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well how does she smell it then?</v>

95
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:13.714
<v Speaker 1>So I hate the smell and that is why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually prefer to wear a tampon cause I </v>

96
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>like you don't smell it as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how does she smell it?</v>

97
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 1>You just from the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wear like a pad?</v>

98
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh then you take it off and it was kind </v>

99
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 1>of like a Wa it's like a strong odor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>

100
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>What does it smell like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gross.</v>

101
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Like body odor or like blood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both,</v>

102
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I guess you like like stink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa it,</v>

103
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.653
<v Speaker 1>he has men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all the men listening to this </v>

104
00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:46.840
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

105
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.453
<v Speaker 1>we're not supposed to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the ladies pack don't break </v>

106
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls don't poop.</v>

107
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>They don't fart and they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>their periods.</v>

108
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Did you all know that periods stink?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

109
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.053
<v Speaker 1>What did you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about odor being </v>

110
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>involved can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

111
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:09.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm not describing it right but I </v>
<v Speaker 1>find a girl.</v>

112
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she says herself,</v>

113
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>she sniffs her period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blood sometimes satisfying some.</v>

114
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever find it satisfying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always grows sometimes more gross than</v>

115
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:19.484
<v Speaker 1>other times if I smell it more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you think it's all equally gross </v>

116
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.880
<v Speaker 1>cause she's saying sometimes it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra stake.</v>

117
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fraud like it smelled like red wine.</v>

118
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Does it have anything to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>volume of blood that's in it?</v>

119
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And does it have anything to do with the</v>

120
00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:41.770
<v Speaker 1>wounds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last time you changed your Tampon?</v>

121
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Like if how much body odor and sweat </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets mixed in.</v>

122
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fascinating stuff.</v>

123
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

124
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.233
<v Speaker 1>this is new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that it uniformly </v>

125
00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:58.994
<v Speaker 1>always smells bad and you even go so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as to wear tampons to avoid smelling it </v>

126
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>all together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

127
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>So what I want to pose to our female </v>
<v Speaker 1>listeners today is,</v>

128
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever smell your period blood?</v>

129
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 1>So we are going to make a twitter poll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

130
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:19.574
<v Speaker 1>you've got the bigger yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For ladies only head on over to h </v>

131
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>podcasts on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a lady and cast your vote,</v>

132
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:29.850
<v Speaker 1>do you ever smell your period blood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now these are fully anonymous vote,</v>

133
00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:30.684
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to worry about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>out at or being discovered or anyone </v>

134
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 1>knowing about your disgusting habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we all have.</v>

135
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:38.084
<v Speaker 1>So not to worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am truly fascinated by this </v>

136
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blood smell.</v>

137
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.563
<v Speaker 1>It's a new concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a paradigm shift in my </v>

138
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:47.360
<v Speaker 1>understanding of periods.</v>

139
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.340
<v Speaker 1>How was the early voting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very curious.</v>

140
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 1>So my initial refresh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>53 votes,</v>

141
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>and it's about 50 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 49 51 right now.</v>

142
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a feeling it would be like a vote.</v>

143
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:03.940
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take going to be 50 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there ever,</v>

144
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

145
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

146
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:08.290
<v Speaker 1>there's been huge swings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been huge swings.</v>

147
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>We've had 70 thirties and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>We had a 60 40 with the front and wiping</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fiasco.</v>

149
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

150
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Speaker 1>that's what I thought it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be.</v>

151
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.273
<v Speaker 1>I expected that because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm a woman and I have stinky </v>

152
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 1>periods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm smelling it cause I'm already saying</v>

153
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:26.024
<v Speaker 1>I smell my farts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be sounds climbing in that that 50 </v>

154
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:32.570
<v Speaker 1>50 ratio is holding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's holding steady.</v>

155
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I would think that I would be smelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>my period blood it.</v>

156
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:36.921
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

157
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:37.754
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I scratched my balls and </v>

158
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:40.244
<v Speaker 1>smelling the hint.</v>

159
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I think they just be smelling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's just two types of people</v>

160
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:46.040
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

161
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Probably the people like or in denial </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

162
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in.</v>

163
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.053
<v Speaker 1>I do think that's true because it sounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't want it to return true </v>

164
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 1>because it sounds like you do smell your</v>
<v Speaker 1>period blood.</v>

165
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:01.840
<v Speaker 1>You're aware of the smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>

166
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you what ads on some level you still</v>

167
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 1>do smell and assess it and make some </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of it.</v>

168
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.173
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that you're in denial and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't embrace it as something you </v>

169
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:16.050
<v Speaker 1>know that you can get into on a personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

170
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

171
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy that I got nine months right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

172
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:22.944
<v Speaker 1>Period went out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it's almost like the baby is </v>

173
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 1>almost like the nine months of period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like stored up and it's just like,</v>

174
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a break and then a burst.</v>

175
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be,</v>

176
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.673
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you got something good going </v>

177
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:40.010
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the wave,</v>

178
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 1>but at least it has a happy end to </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods.</v>

179
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't necessarily have happy endings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excepted the rover.</v>

180
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll be right there with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

181
00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have so much admiration.</v>

182
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:52.194
<v Speaker 1>I have so much respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to go through that and I'm not </v>

183
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.213
<v Speaker 1>jealous of that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm truly appreciative that you need to </v>

184
00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 1>do that because my god of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

185
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

186
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.753
<v Speaker 1>That's an idea thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean denial about the that has to </v>

187
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:08.660
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

188
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 1>well it's really just something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

189
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby's coming.</v>

190
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to do it.</v>

191
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.610
<v Speaker 1>You just have to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to get drug,</v>

192
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be smart about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just not feeling thing because a lot</v>

193
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 1>of women are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd want to do it natural.</v>

194
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 1>And then halfway through when they're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>excruciating pain,</v>

195
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:26.340
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

196
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:29.300
<v Speaker 1>they thing the band name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My sister is crazy.</v>

197
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.850
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like no painkillers and she'll,</v>

198
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 1>she really didn't take anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout.</v>

199
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Your sister's a superhuman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a freaking nature.</v>

200
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.273
<v Speaker 1>But in your case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the reason women don't get this </v>

201
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.930
<v Speaker 1>because it could take longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

202
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Painkiller Fred,</v>

203
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.540
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're a nom,</v>

204
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:51.300
<v Speaker 1>you're won't push hard as much as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>word if you're not.</v>

205
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I prefer the painkiller from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective to not feel pain and have it</v>

206
00:10:56.151 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 1>take an extra five hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

207
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.660
<v Speaker 1>five hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

208
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that's an exaggerated </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison,</v>

209
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:07.590
<v Speaker 1>but I think that you'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I agree with you.</v>

210
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.250
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to trust me.</v>

211
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy that knows nothing about it.</v>

212
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it.</v>

213
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.380
<v Speaker 1>And then halfway through she decided she</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted it,</v>

214
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.290
<v Speaker 1>but then it took long ago cause they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have it prepared for her.</v>

215
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.483
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole time she was just like </v>

216
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you get the painkiller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like no pain,</v>

217
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:30.300
<v Speaker 1>like total numbness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

218
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.790
<v Speaker 1>it's probably helped the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps.</v>

219
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:36.420
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think because when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

220
00:11:36.421 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

221
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I had a huge mole removed on my back as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid.</v>

222
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I must've been 12 or 11,</v>

223
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:46.380
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

224
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>it was a really big surgery where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut it out.</v>

225
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.293
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they gave me numbing shots and it </v>

226
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 1>was extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely painful,</v>

227
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 1>it was so painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These shots,</v>

228
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was price cause it was just a shot.</v>

229
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.623
<v Speaker 1>I think this one is also painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I felt nothing like zero sensation </v>

230
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.580
<v Speaker 1>and I was awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I time,</v>

231
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I think you're already in so much pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

232
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it?</v>

233
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Contraptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

234
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 1>the contraptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

235
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.390
<v Speaker 1>So I think that pain of that shot is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like tracking competitor actions.</v>

236
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have amazing medicines that</v>

237
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 1>I think will really minimize the pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>you experience.</v>

238
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.070
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is like when I had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery on my back,</v>

239
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.173
<v Speaker 1>so I felt no pain at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when they finished they had to </v>

240
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:38.314
<v Speaker 1>sew me up and the doctor had to cat co,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call that when you </v>

241
00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 1>electrocuted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catterick colorize cauterize.</v>

242
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.100
<v Speaker 1>He had to cauterize my flesh together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he basically,</v>

243
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:51.430
<v Speaker 1>he literally like burned my flesh </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and that was fucking,</v>

244
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.260
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't feel the pain,</v>

245
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:56.050
<v Speaker 1>but it felt so weird cause I was being </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrocuted.</v>

246
00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.790
<v Speaker 1>How'd that smell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

247
00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:58.923
<v Speaker 1>I didn't smell flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just found it was just a wild </v>

248
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:03.760
<v Speaker 1>sensation dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

249
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.553
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a couple of people who </v>

250
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:07.960
<v Speaker 1>responded.</v>

251
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I do and I secretly think it smells </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

252
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:11.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

253
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think exactly.</v>

254
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a very interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy discussion guys.</v>

255
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.493
<v Speaker 1>This moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually exactly 50 50 and then </v>

256
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what to choose,</v>

257
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 1>but you can't avoid smelling it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still gross.</v>

258
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.313
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there really are two types of </v>

259
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:29.700
<v Speaker 1>people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

260
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.970
<v Speaker 1>and I think that was exactly 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it boils down to.</v>

261
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are in denial as you said,</v>

262
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.403
<v Speaker 1>dance and people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm onboard with spelling my period and </v>

263
00:13:40.101 --> 00:13:40.934
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you the same people that smell </v>

264
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:42.664
<v Speaker 1>their fear period blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll still smelling their farts and </v>

265
00:13:44.531 --> 00:13:48.640
<v Speaker 1>they'd probably pitched their vagina and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell their hand probably,</v>

266
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

267
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.890
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fascinating stuff here guys.</v>

268
00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 1>This is a science explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if science experience full beginning</v>

269
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.030
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

<v Speaker 1>part of this stage.</v>

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.850
<v Speaker 1>How was Disney for you yesterday as a </v>

<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

312
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.090
<v Speaker 2>It's wife sue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a good day recently.</v>

313
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.113
<v Speaker 1>That's love baby</v>

314
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.680
<v Speaker 2>or stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just working on growing my business.</v>

315
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.563
<v Speaker 2>I look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the reenactment that gives you </v>

316
00:16:32.161 --> 00:16:34.170
<v Speaker 2>any more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>

317
00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:35.004
<v Speaker 2>what am I watching?</v>

318
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the burping sound is insane.</v>

319
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.420
<v Speaker 1>It's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

320
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:43.403
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I soon learned is that the burping </v>

321
00:16:46.441 --> 00:16:50.550
<v Speaker 1>soundbite they use is a sound bite from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual guy.</v>

322
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.770
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's actually,</v>

323
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.870
<v Speaker 1>so what they're doing is playing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual birth,</v>

324
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.360
<v Speaker 1>but the guy every time they say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

325
00:16:57.361 --> 00:17:00.720
<v Speaker 1>you could tell because they show one </v>
<v Speaker 1>brief clip of actual guy burping.</v>

326
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:01.883
<v Speaker 1>And so they use that one soundbite and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they use it every time in this </v>

327
00:17:04.411 --> 00:17:05.730
<v Speaker 1>reenactment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sounds,</v>

328
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.100
<v Speaker 1>it's the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

329
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:08.623
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

330
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started gradually</v>

331
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.190
<v Speaker 1>and he's so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you just burp I,</v>

332
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.000
<v Speaker 1>and he's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry ma'am.</v>

333
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.390
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

334
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.340
<v Speaker 2>I would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking trolling,</v>

335
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.183
<v Speaker 2>you know when I was at the customer's </v>
<v Speaker 2>house and then when I went outside and </v>

336
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.630
<v Speaker 2>real dump trunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just belching belching balls.</v>

337
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.010
<v Speaker 2>You got the brushed her off</v>

338
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.903
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

339
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.830
<v Speaker 2>It seemed crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron's no,</v>

340
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.370
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't help it.</v>

341
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.580
<v Speaker 2>I balls for maybe 2030 minutes an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then start up again.</v>

342
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have to Burp so loud?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just close your mouth.</v>

343
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to Burp loud.</v>

344
00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he can control it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does this show about it?</v>

345
00:18:17.771 --> 00:18:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it can control it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee.</v>

346
00:18:20.231 --> 00:18:21.064
<v Speaker 1>He's burping a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean you could control how loud </v>

347
00:18:23.111 --> 00:18:25.420
<v Speaker 1>you burp.</v>

<v Speaker 2>suggest it's all in Ron's head.</v>

358
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Stop thinking about it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you supposed to do?</v>

359
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Like Dang gone has been belching nonstop</v>

360
00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:30.693

<v Speaker 2>going to dozens of doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one cure that's out working.</v>

363
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:44.733

369
00:20:02.361 --> 00:20:03.194

<v Speaker 1>like here and then they'll like damp in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

371
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:09.523

<v Speaker 1>but they're just using the same </v>

372
00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.873
<v Speaker 1>soundbite</v>

376
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.490
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

377
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.610
<v Speaker 1>like he's turning into a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Stephen King novel.</v>

378
00:20:30.611 --> 00:20:32.200
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

382
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.830
<v Speaker 2>emergency room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They looked over my records.</v>

383
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.170
<v Speaker 2>They said there's nothing we can do for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

384
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.343
<v Speaker 2>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott is assigned to mental health </v>

00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 2>counselor Lisa Gustin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

386
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Rick questions open up the reservoir of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pent up.</v>

387
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Although he does this factor when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>birthed,</v>

388
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see the guy do that.</v>

389
00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.240
<v Speaker 2>He just fit every criteria for anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 2>and depression.</v>

390
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.210
<v Speaker 2>He fitted</v>

391
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.153
<v Speaker 1>why way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out he needed an </v>

392
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:17.290
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really and he wasn't manifesting anxiety</v>

393
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.190
<v Speaker 1>and unusual way and that he's cared now </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

394
00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the BURP.</v>

397
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:34.503
<v Speaker 1>The first time I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could wash the first time with </v>

<v Speaker 2>On the general lines,</v>

402
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:50.690
<v Speaker 2>they worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they edit it.</v>

403
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.423
<v Speaker 1>He does this look like perfect like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand times a day and he's surprised </v>

404
00:22:00.441 --> 00:22:01.274
<v Speaker 1>every time it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adidas sorta combined with clinical </v>

406
00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.413

<v Speaker 1>It stimulates the brain in a certain </v>

407
00:22:14.451 --> 00:22:16.370
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

415
00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.610
<v Speaker 1>this truly is the nature of what this is</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think it's the only guy in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I get another cookie?</v>

477
00:25:48.891 --> 00:25:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Those are incredible.</v>

478
00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

479
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:52.664
<v Speaker 1>I got something to complain about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who likes to hear me complain </v>

480
00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:58.160
<v Speaker 1>about Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a fun little anecdote.</v>

481
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.380
<v Speaker 1>So I got a claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

482
00:26:00.381 --> 00:26:01.214
<v Speaker 1>you actually brought me a cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't need that to let you know that </v>

483
00:26:07.701 --> 00:26:09.470
<v Speaker 1>your mom delivered all of her babies </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally.</v>

484
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:11.143
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if you could hear that </v>

485
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Ethan's mom delivered all of her babies </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally,</v>

486
00:26:16.551 --> 00:26:19.430
<v Speaker 1>but I think that was just the time back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

487
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.030
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like my mom did too.</v>

488
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Or like my mom would have a lot to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this chicken call.</v>

489
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:27.933
<v Speaker 1>It gives me more time to eat cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to buy time to eat more </v>

490
00:26:30.981 --> 00:26:32.800

<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

499
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.710
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

500
00:26:55.711 --> 00:26:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to complain about Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

501
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're coming here for papa.</v>

502
00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:00.220
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mute me.</v>

503
00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.053
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a highlight claimed by whoever </v>

504
00:27:04.261 --> 00:27:08.340
<v Speaker 1>these cocksuckers are for a song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex on fire.</v>

505
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the interesting little fact.</v>

506
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 1>We didn't use that song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even in the clip.</v>

507
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:22.430
<v Speaker 1>So I file a dispute and there's not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>an option for this.</v>

508
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you claimed isn't even in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

509
00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:26.973
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

510
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.230
<v Speaker 1>there's not even an option of like fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

511
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

512
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:34.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I what?</v>

513
00:27:34.311 --> 00:27:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I did like,</v>

514
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I think you just doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fair.</v>

515
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Use My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my use.</v>

516
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Is there something I didn't know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't use it?</v>

517
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how would that even get in there?</v>

518
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I did,</v>

519
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:50.680
<v Speaker 1>but I just basically said in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scripture,</v>

520
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.480
<v Speaker 1>this song did not appear in the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So release your claim.</v>

521
00:27:55.650 --> 00:28:00.650
<v Speaker 1>And so here's the best part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are these huge media companies.</v>

522
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Just go on rampages of claiming videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no,</v>

523
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no recourse,</v>

524
00:28:09.331 --> 00:28:10.164
<v Speaker 1>there's no accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get free money and they have no </v>

525
00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:16.350
<v Speaker 1>reason not to claim every single video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I waiting for one of these guys who just</v>

526
00:28:16.351 --> 00:28:20.190
<v Speaker 1>claim every single video on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

527
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:21.090
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

528
00:28:21.091 --> 00:28:23.750
<v Speaker 1>you use sex on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way the law's written there,</v>

529
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:28.770
<v Speaker 1>there's no recourse or well technically </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a false claim that it's so broad.</v>

530
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.460
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

531
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:38.510
<v Speaker 1>and good faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could,</v>

532
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:39.643
<v Speaker 1>I think that a claim like this for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's not even in the video </v>

533
00:28:42.711 --> 00:28:45.830
<v Speaker 1>is an end good faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're,</v>

534
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:50.090
<v Speaker 1>you're bringing a lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the company for something.</v>

535
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

536
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:54.343
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

537
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.220
<v Speaker 1>and there's no damages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

538
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.630
<v Speaker 1>it's pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

539
00:28:59.631 --> 00:29:03.230
<v Speaker 1>what do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would need to have like a huge class</v>

540
00:29:03.231 --> 00:29:08.150
<v Speaker 1>action lawsuit to show like tons of </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage over like thousands of users.</v>

541
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.420
<v Speaker 1>It would be so complicated to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>litigate that.</v>

542
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:15.230
<v Speaker 1>So expensive and complicated to litigate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and they know it.</v>

543
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.450
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I'm aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've never been held,</v>

544
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.790
<v Speaker 1>recount accountable for this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the options.</v>

545
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.713
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are all these except for fair use </v>

546
00:29:24.111 --> 00:29:24.944
<v Speaker 1>I think or well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them except for farriers are </v>

547
00:29:27.681 --> 00:29:31.670
<v Speaker 1>just like youtube way of being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see you later,</v>

548
00:29:31.671 --> 00:29:32.504
<v Speaker 1>idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what you get when you try to </v>

549
00:29:34.131 --> 00:29:37.490
<v Speaker 1>dispute it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I own the CD that's youtube being like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>see Ya.</v>

551
00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.970
<v Speaker 1>I think if you click that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a reason.</v>

552
00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

553
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:44.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not selling the video or making any </v>

554
00:29:46.631 --> 00:29:47.680
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a skip.</v>

555

<v Speaker 1>Actually find claims to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't remember which one I did,</v>

562
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:10.681
<v Speaker 1>but their response is what's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes this a powerful.</v>

563
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they responded by,</v>

564
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I disputed it and they responded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejecting my dispute.</v>

565
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.823
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they would dispute it.</v>

582
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:11.150
<v Speaker 1>So now I am forced to go one step </v>
<v Speaker 1>further in the process.</v>

583
00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And at this point you basically say your</v>
<v Speaker 1>songs aren't in the video,</v>

584
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:17.443
<v Speaker 1>leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have the option to strike and </v>

585
00:31:19.461 --> 00:31:20.294
<v Speaker 1>remove the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's something wrong with youtube </v>

586
00:31:23.451 --> 00:31:26.120
<v Speaker 1>though because three of our last three </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos have been claimed,</v>

587
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.343
<v Speaker 1>like the frequency of claiming videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just erroneous and shameless claims </v>

588
00:31:31.731 --> 00:31:34.220
<v Speaker 1>have sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean three of our last view.</v>

589
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.073
<v Speaker 1>And it's still a bunch of new companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have like a whole division that is </v>

590
00:31:39.501 --> 00:31:42.410
<v Speaker 1>just this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it has new claiming stuff.</v>

591
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I think they have tools because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot go watch videos.</v>

592
00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.850
<v Speaker 1>They have some kind of automated tools </v>
<v Speaker 1>that match it.</v>

593
00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.510
<v Speaker 1>And this case it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't even put in the effort to</v>

594
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:54.890
<v Speaker 1>reviewing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

595
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.963
<v Speaker 1>youtube has got to regulate these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're running a muck right </v>

596
00:31:59.691 --> 00:32:02.090
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has not been this bad ever,</v>

597
00:32:02.091 --> 00:32:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

598
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.513
<v Speaker 1>and then just to show you guys where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the video of all of our </v>

599
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.160
<v Speaker 1>demonetize monetize videos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

602

603
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:30.140

<v Speaker 1>That does not work.</v>

604
00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.050
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that I absolutely love.</v>

636
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 1>It's called the subtle art of not giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bleep,</v>

637
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.590
<v Speaker 1>which is the f word,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is an unorthodox motivational book </v>

640
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:40.810
<v Speaker 1>because there's been a whole kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>slew of like self help gurus saying that</v>

641
00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:44.960
<v Speaker 1>positive thinking is the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improving our life.</v>

642
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.100
<v Speaker 1>And this guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

643
00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Positive thinking is not only not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>

644
00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:51.380
<v Speaker 1>it's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we need is to accept that we're all</v>

645
00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:53.120
<v Speaker 1>damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life isn't fair.</v>

646
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:56.930
<v Speaker 1>And what we need more is to just stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving a frick.</v>

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:58.880
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Ashley Graham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emily Radic,</v>

811
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Koski Cardi B and so many more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some hike.</v>

812
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:42.164
<v Speaker 1>They're all females by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kind of supports my theory for </v>

813
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Jake Gyllenhaal as one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but otherwise it's all females.</v>

814
00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Supports my theory that GB is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to dispute,</v>

815
00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.730
<v Speaker 1>which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gb,</v>

816
00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.153
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is largely used by men that </v>

817
00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.500
<v Speaker 1>liked this virtual companionship of </v>
<v Speaker 1>females.</v>

818
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like especially the one with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cardi B,</v>

819
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:10.030
<v Speaker 1>when you show it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show that.</v>

820
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.440
<v Speaker 1>But first I want to show up what most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

821
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:14.720
<v Speaker 1>This is actually the most viewed one by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cora.</v>

822
00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.170
<v Speaker 1>That's 5 million views and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will.</v>

823
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just whispering.</v>

824
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really me so weird.</v>

825
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Westbury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just,</v>

826
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:33.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually really bad for your </v>

827
00:44:34.921 --> 00:44:35.754
<v Speaker 1>throat.</v>

828
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Fun fact number one.</v>

829
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:44.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

830
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm Kyra telephone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just worth a frame.</v>

831
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what she has to mix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does she keep switching mikes?</v>

832
00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:52.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tomorrow.</v>

833
00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of it is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pan hard left and right.</v>

834
00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:57.853
<v Speaker 1>And so like us in the back right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the headphones were hearing her in </v>

835
00:44:59.871 --> 00:45:01.840
<v Speaker 1>one year and then the other year and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's like,</v>

836
00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:02.840
<v Speaker 1>that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

837
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.810
<v Speaker 1>But I think you're supposed to do like </v>
<v Speaker 1>use it as for the like,</v>

838
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.240
<v Speaker 1>but she's no expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have an expert on the line.</v>

839
00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played too.</v>

840
00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:14.230
<v Speaker 1>At any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's niche.</v>

841
00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:16.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a celebrity whispering,</v>

842
00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:17.613
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

843
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Like Cardi B on the other hand does give</v>
<v Speaker 1>it a fair shake.</v>

844
00:45:22.041 --> 00:45:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually impressed she got through </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

845
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this dude.</v>

846
00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.280
<v Speaker 1>My Dick is straight up at full half math</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

847
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if she smells or period blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She probably does already be.</v>

848
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Probably next time you're approaching a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl that you're interested in,</v>

849
00:45:49.701 --> 00:45:50.511
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>

850
00:45:50.511 --> 00:45:52.520
<v Speaker 1>she's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's so out of my league.</v>

851
00:45:52.521 --> 00:45:54.050
<v Speaker 1>I can't even talk to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just remember,</v>

852
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:58.740
<v Speaker 1>most likely she smells her period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blood life dude.</v>

853
00:45:59.320 --> 00:45:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

854
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Just remember she's human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's snips your period blood.</v>

855
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting tinkled I like the hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>gestures.</v>

856
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.073
<v Speaker 1>She's got her hand out on a client like </v>
<v Speaker 1>scratching my back or something </v>

857
00:46:15.021 --> 00:46:15.854
<v Speaker 1>virtually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

858
00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Did she sell intuit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

859
00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Fucking a stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

860
00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:30.050
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of weird with the Mike's and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

861
00:46:30.051 --> 00:46:31.850
<v Speaker 1>she's dual welding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking,</v>

862
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's taken both of them at once.</v>

863
00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I saw it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck dude?</v>

864
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm tingling and all the right places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she is actually doing good.</v>

865
00:46:47.451 --> 00:46:52.451
<v Speaker 1>I feel like she is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to know what you think so,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a smart expert.</v>

874
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Now your channel is quite big and it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very popular.</v>

875
00:47:21.591 --> 00:47:23.480
<v Speaker 1>You're very good at what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently,</v>

876
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:26.210
<v Speaker 1>and so thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

877
00:47:26.211 --> 00:47:28.520
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you smell your period blood?</v>

878
00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:29.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

879
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:31.063
<v Speaker 5>we were just talking about that in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>room because we were watching the </v>

880
00:47:33.591 --> 00:47:34.424
<v Speaker 5>beginning of the podcast.</v>

881
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

882
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you have a preference to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have come off really weird.</v>

883
00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:40.550
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what I was talking about.</v>

884
00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:46.640
<v Speaker 5>We were saying that like that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the consensus is you don't really</v>

885
00:47:46.641 --> 00:47:47.474
<v Speaker 5>have a choice.</v>

886
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the question really,</v>

887
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:50.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

888
00:47:50.981 --> 00:47:51.600
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't need,</v>

889
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.220
<v Speaker 1>we have who don't need to dive too deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't you,</v>

890
00:47:54.221 --> 00:47:55.054
<v Speaker 1>you smell it against your will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems to be your answer so you can </v>

891
00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:04.490
<v Speaker 1>finally grows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No wait.</v>

892
00:48:04.691 --> 00:48:06.090
<v Speaker 1>She said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't know gross.</v>

893
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:08.260
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not pleasant.</v>

894
00:48:08.261 --> 00:48:09.650
<v Speaker 5>I would not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would not smell it.</v>

895
00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent.</v>

896
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad we got to the bottom of that.</v>

897
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:15.023
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you think about these </v>

898
00:48:15.561 --> 00:48:19.470
<v Speaker 1>celebrity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a cmr segments that I just shared.</v>

899
00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:20.550
<v Speaker 1>If you're watching those.</v>

900
00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've actually seen those.</v>

901
00:48:23.991 --> 00:48:24.870
<v Speaker 5>So the W it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

902
00:48:24.871 --> 00:48:25.930
<v Speaker 5>it's a women's magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

903
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

904
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

905
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

906
00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.500
<v Speaker 5>it's actually really cool to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>celebrities doing asmr because,</v>

907
00:48:36.501 --> 00:48:37.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a couple of years ago,</v>

908
00:48:37.601 --> 00:48:40.970
<v Speaker 5>it's something that no one was talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about or I had heard I've heard of,</v>

909
00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.253
<v Speaker 5>like I've been watching it for like </v>
<v Speaker 5>eight years on Youtube and since I know </v>

910
00:48:45.621 --> 00:48:46.454
<v Speaker 5>my channel is all like two years old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've been watching it forever and </v>

911
00:48:48.531 --> 00:48:49.364
<v Speaker 5>like I was always embarrassed to talk </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it because when you come in on it </v>

912
00:48:52.941 --> 00:48:53.880
<v Speaker 5>at first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like this,</v>

913
00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:55.760
<v Speaker 5>this is kind of weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like objectively.</v>

914
00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:56.880
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

915
00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.340
<v Speaker 5>but when you see people like Cardi b </v>
<v Speaker 5>like doing asr,</v>

916
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:01.943
<v Speaker 5>less weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're sort of making it more </v>

917
00:49:03.951 --> 00:49:04.784
<v Speaker 5>normal.</v>

918
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:06.883
<v Speaker 1>And so what is it that I got wrong or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what did I miss and my original segment </v>

919
00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.770
<v Speaker 1>about asm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our videos?</v>

920
00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:14.143
<v Speaker 1>Because to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people I've previously spoken </v>

921
00:49:16.971 --> 00:49:21.971
<v Speaker 1>that it does seem to be like the popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acmr channels are ones of cute,</v>

922
00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:24.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cute young girls,</v>

923
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.660
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not young,</v>

924
00:49:26.661 --> 00:49:28.940
<v Speaker 1>not young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young ladies,</v>

925
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:32.600
<v Speaker 1>practice two attractive young ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

926
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:33.740
<v Speaker 1>it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

927
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:34.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a guy it's a nice kind of way to get </v>

928
00:49:36.981 --> 00:49:41.030
<v Speaker 1>a companionship and relaxed and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a wave spending time,</v>

929
00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.970
<v Speaker 1>intimate time with a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you contradict that?</v>

930
00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's everything though.</v>

931
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

932
00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.430
<v Speaker 5>I think most like most people who have </v>
<v Speaker 5>never seen it before,</v>

933
00:49:54.431 --> 00:49:55.690
<v Speaker 5>they jump in on it and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

934
00:49:55.691 --> 00:49:57.970
<v Speaker 5>this must be a sex day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

935
00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.073
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and while you can absolutely find asmr </v>

936
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:05.860
<v Speaker 5>videos of sexual overtones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can find sexual anything.</v>

937
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:06.694
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people will always utilize that to get </v>

938
00:50:08.201 --> 00:50:10.300
<v Speaker 5>views or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to gain popularity quickly.</v>

939
00:50:10.301 --> 00:50:12.280
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe it's just how they like to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

940
00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:15.430
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I have some art itself.</v>

941
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:17.800
<v Speaker 5>Like I keep asking people like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>over and over again,</v>

942
00:50:17.801 --> 00:50:18.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so why do you watch it?</v>

943
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:21.580
<v Speaker 5>Why do you watch it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like the overwhelming response.</v>

944
00:50:21.581 --> 00:50:23.710
<v Speaker 5>It's just people need to be stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

945
00:50:23.711 --> 00:50:27.220
<v Speaker 5>Like they need to relax and it's free </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's accessible.</v>

946
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.670
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

947
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.930
<v Speaker 5>and more people enjoy Asmr like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like nightly,</v>

948
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:35.150
<v Speaker 5>like they just want to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

949
00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:37.100
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I have heard,</v>

950
00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:37.934
<v Speaker 5>and I'm even myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I've used the smr when you feel </v>

951
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:45.700
<v Speaker 5>like lonely and you just want somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking for a while on a video.</v>

952
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.593
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could do that with any youtube </v>

953
00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:49.424
<v Speaker 5>video.</v>

954
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's this kind of the whispering,</v>

955
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:53.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

956
00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:57.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a sense of intimacy and like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ticking it tough.</v>

957
00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:57.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

958
00:50:57.971 --> 00:50:58.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

959
00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

960
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:04.160
<v Speaker 1>so what does a popular misconception </v>
<v Speaker 1>about asm or that people get wrong?</v>

961
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:07.660
<v Speaker 1>He want to correct that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just sexual,</v>

962
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:10.130
<v Speaker 5>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you said intimacy because it,</v>

963
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:12.890
<v Speaker 5>I think that we can all agree that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

964
00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.540
<v Speaker 5>it's intimate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

965
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:16.580
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would say like,</v>

966
00:51:16.581 --> 00:51:17.414
<v Speaker 5>it's more intimate in the way that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when your mom like puts you to bed </v>

967
00:51:20.841 --> 00:51:22.700
<v Speaker 5>and she was like rubbing your back and </v>
<v Speaker 5>singing you a song.</v>

968
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 5>If you wouldn't want a stranger do that </v>
<v Speaker 5>to you,</v>

969
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.680
<v Speaker 5>but it's not sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

970
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.050
<v Speaker 5>and so I think like when somebody gets,</v>

971
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:33.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for a lot of guys it might be,</v>

972
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I do like the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have a problem.</v>

973
00:51:40.231 --> 00:51:41.064
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree that it's not only sexual </v>

974
00:51:43.261 --> 00:51:44.250
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know like with,</v>

975

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

976
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:50.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to embarrass you too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

977
00:51:50.611 --> 00:51:53.670

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

979

<v Speaker 1>tell to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you feel about this one would </v>

986
00:52:17.571 --> 00:52:20.400

<v Speaker 1>That's an unfortunate microphone shape,</v>

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.300
<v Speaker 1>but she was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1072
00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.550
<v Speaker 5>there's two types of people in the world</v>
<v Speaker 5>because some people,</v>

1073
00:55:57.551 --> 00:55:58.201
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you,</v>

1074
00:55:58.201 --> 00:56:00.970
<v Speaker 5>you hear the sounds and you get like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tingling feeling and it's like,</v>

1075
00:56:00.971 --> 00:56:01.804
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is really nice.</v>

1076
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:03.580
<v Speaker 5>Some people hear the sounds and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1077
00:56:03.581 --> 00:56:04.930
<v Speaker 5>I wanna die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1078
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.550
<v Speaker 5>Like me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1079
00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.680
<v Speaker 5>The smell period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blood or you don't,</v>

1080
00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.630
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1081
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.120
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:13.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not that.</v>

1083
00:56:13.571 --> 00:56:15.830
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I wanna die when I see our </v>
<v Speaker 5>channel.</v>

1084
00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:16.773
<v Speaker 5>Not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my initial reaction will this </v>

1085
00:56:20.261 --> 00:56:21.130
<v Speaker 5>trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:23.740
<v Speaker 5>When I think of someone we spring is </v>
<v Speaker 5>pleasant.</v>

1087
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.633
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1088
00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily feel tingles,</v>

1089
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:32.320
<v Speaker 1>but I do feel kind of like a lightness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a pleasant sensation,</v>

1090
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:35.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like extra relaxation.</v>

1091
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:35.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nice.</v>

1092
00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:37.360
<v Speaker 1>It is nice to hear though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do some,</v>

1093
00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:39.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Smr for me to can't,</v>

1094
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:43.990
<v Speaker 1>do you ever do a one like for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend?</v>

1095
00:56:43.991 --> 00:56:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Would you ever do like a one person Acmr</v>
<v Speaker 1>sesh?</v>

1096
00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.710
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't get a Smr that was like super</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate.</v>

1097
00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like beet red out here.</v>

1098
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

1099
00:56:59.311 --> 00:57:01.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of ironic I guess.</v>

1100
00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:04.180
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunate that your boyfriend </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't experience any,</v>

1101
00:57:04.181 --> 00:57:07.560
<v Speaker 1>some more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's going to expert for a</v>

1102
00:57:07.561 --> 00:57:09.070
<v Speaker 1>girl could have been something there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1103
00:57:09.071 --> 00:57:13.140
<v Speaker 1>it could have been some great there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be interesting to do like a</v>

1104
00:57:13.141 --> 00:57:16.710
<v Speaker 1>one person Acmr show or like you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually like,</v>

1105
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.720
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a massage in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have like a,</v>

1106
00:57:19.721 --> 00:57:21.870
<v Speaker 1>a a cmr therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1107
00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:23.100
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

1108
00:57:23.101 --> 00:57:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I his growing it exists already.</v>

1109
00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:26.910
<v Speaker 1>It exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1110
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.113
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the smr spa that keeps popping </v>

1111
00:57:29.501 --> 00:57:30.334
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some of that.</v>

1112
00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:33.820
<v Speaker 5>And then some in New York it's called </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a whisper lodge I think.</v>

1113
00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:34.763
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1114
00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:36.371
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1115
00:57:36.371 --> 00:57:37.204
<v Speaker 5>So people are really exploring with it </v>
<v Speaker 5>now and experimenting and doing live </v>

1116
00:57:39.941 --> 00:57:41.050
<v Speaker 5>shows and things like that.</v>

1117
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.153
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it will ever become </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream or is it going to be </v>

1118
00:57:43.361 --> 00:57:45.400
<v Speaker 1>something that's always hard to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people?</v>

1119
00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.273
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

1120
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:49.990
<v Speaker 5>If I compare it to a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 5>ago,</v>

1121
00:57:49.991 --> 00:57:53.350
<v Speaker 5>like it is crazy mainstream now compared</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1122
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:54.283
<v Speaker 5>so I think it's really only going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in because every time it sort of </v>

1123
00:57:56.951 --> 00:57:57.784
<v Speaker 5>comes up in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we get more people in the community who </v>

1124
00:57:59.651 --> 00:58:00.461
<v Speaker 5>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:17.813
<v Speaker 1>It was interesting that she acknowledged</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is because I thought she was </v>

1164
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:24.770
<v Speaker 1>refuting that it's like it is not sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not sexual,</v>

1165
00:59:24.771 --> 00:59:27.470
<v Speaker 1>but like intimate or a lot like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys are like,</v>

1166
00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:30.950
<v Speaker 1>like the intimacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not sexual,</v>

1167
00:59:30.951 --> 00:59:31.784
<v Speaker 1>but like intimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she did acknowledge that it's that </v>

1168
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:35.810
<v Speaker 1>and it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think I agree,</v>

1169
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:37.423
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1170
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:40.280
<v Speaker 1>she's a professional,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That didn't help.</v>

1181
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.593
<v Speaker 1>But you do find her attractive right in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's very talented or what she </v>

<v Speaker 1>But she does have a boyfriend,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It makes me wish that I enjoyed it.</v>

1188
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm missing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried though?</v>

1189
01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know that I don't like,</v>

1190
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:40.993
<v Speaker 1>cause I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave it like a good shot for five or </v>

1191
01:00:42.651 --> 01:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes and I was very pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was nice.</v>

1192
01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And then cause like I was watching like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cute girl and I was like,</v>

1193
01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find a dude and I,</v>

1194
01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:54.883
<v Speaker 1>and there's this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I showed it like a gnarly bearded dude </v>

1195
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>and he's like insane.</v>

1196
01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Like he's all over the place and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy is like a king.</v>

1197
01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.400
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1198
01:01:07.401 --> 01:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1199
01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.150

<v Speaker 1>was just as good.</v>

1200
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.870
<v Speaker 1>But also you're not really supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it.</v>

1201
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to just listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1202
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Put it in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because the problem that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes me concerned is the people </v>

1279
01:04:57.601 --> 01:04:58.434
<v Speaker 1>that talk with these kinds of means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who like joke around like this </v>

1280
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.010
<v Speaker 1>are not the people that I want getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside Elan Musk beautiful,</v>

1281
01:05:08.011 --> 01:05:10.200
<v Speaker 1>pristine braid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1282
01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want him spending time on </v>
<v Speaker 1>four Chan or Anamae subreddits.</v>

1283
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:21.610
<v Speaker 1>That's maybe that's what it concerns me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more what it means.</v>

1284
01:05:21.611 --> 01:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>That what he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does he know all this stuff?</v>

1285
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you can what you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like anime,</v>

1286
01:05:25.991 --> 01:05:28.230
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

1287
01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>And it wouldn't be more fun for me by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

1288
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>that Elon Musk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need his brain to be in good,</v>

1289
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:36.670
<v Speaker 1>clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pristine,</v>

<v Speaker 1>not Ahem Ilan Chin.</v>

1291
01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.373

<v Speaker 1>want him there and I'm not going to </v>

1292
01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.840
<v Speaker 1>genesis even going.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what'd you say?</v>

1294
01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.133

<v Speaker 1>know if he posted or somebody else </v>

<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1302
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:12.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just a pawn off of a famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>animator.</v>

1306
01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:24.940
<v Speaker 1>a business related question though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

1346
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.860
<v Speaker 1>The model three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys,</v>

1347
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:56.360
<v Speaker 1>I love Tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1348
01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:57.203
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy that they're making it and </v>

1349
01:08:58.941 --> 01:09:01.130
<v Speaker 1>they're making money and they're turning</v>
<v Speaker 1>a profit.</v>

1350
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:05.050
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean especially here in La,</v>

1351
01:09:05.051 --> 01:09:07.900
<v Speaker 1>you see it everywhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere.</v>

1352
01:09:07.901 --> 01:09:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brand new model three is everywhere.</v>

1353
01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I have a lease on a s N it's open a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to,</v>

1354
01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:15.123
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to get a model three </v>
<v Speaker 1>but I find it so amazing that as a </v>

1355
01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:23.921
<v Speaker 1>company they released the model three </v>
<v Speaker 1>with same features even better and for a</v>

1356
01:09:26.391 --> 01:09:27.150
<v Speaker 1>lower price.</v>

1357
01:09:27.150 --> 01:09:27.983
<v Speaker 1>The thing is the model three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the performance version of the model </v>

1358
01:09:31.021 --> 01:09:36.021
<v Speaker 1>three is way less than the model s that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have and it's faster,</v>

1359
01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.170
<v Speaker 1>has a longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any longer battery life.</v>

1360
01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Which of the two things I care the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

1361
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.330
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] it's a little smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really give a fuck.</v>

1362
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more modern.</v>

1363
01:09:47.581 --> 01:09:50.200
<v Speaker 1>It's more futuristic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's going to be so huge.</v>

1364
01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>The model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the model three performance is like,</v>

1365
01:09:54.161 --> 01:09:58.240
<v Speaker 1>the craziest version you can get is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>$70,000.</v>

1366
01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I know that's probably sounds like a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>to most of you,</v>

1367
01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:06.060
<v Speaker 1>but comparable cars that go that speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be like 10 times that price.</v>

1368
01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1369
01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Like a model three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes zero to 60 and like,</v>

1370
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:16.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like three seconds.</v>

1371
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:22.290
<v Speaker 1>The closest thing of that is like crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like porsches and Maseratis and shit.</v>

1372
01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.920
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at two or 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus hours,</v>

1373
01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:26.390
<v Speaker 1>70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks,</v>

1374
01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:31.830
<v Speaker 1>and it's got like 320 miles per charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then it's just,</v>

1375
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.040
<v Speaker 1>it has so much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not a commercial.</v>

1376
01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.193
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows that I am as long they </v>

1377
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.633
<v Speaker 1>don't need to pay anyone how far past </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else because the auto drive </v>

1378
01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.310
<v Speaker 1>is so useful and then it's fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>electric.</v>

1379
01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.750
<v Speaker 1>But the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real thing,</v>

1380
01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.240
<v Speaker 1>the real genius too is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure they've built.</v>

1381
01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.793
<v Speaker 1>There's so many superchargers now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually go on a long distance </v>

1382
01:10:55.011 --> 01:10:55.844
<v Speaker 1>drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we've done many times and charge </v>

1383
01:10:57.561 --> 01:11:00.920
<v Speaker 1>your car fast and reliably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

1384
01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.950
<v Speaker 1>is that the case outside of California?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1385
01:11:03.951 --> 01:11:04.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1386
01:11:04.571 --> 01:11:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Just anywhere you can drive across to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1387
01:11:06.970 --> 01:11:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do a road trip.</v>

1388
01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:09.170
<v Speaker 1>That is really impressive.</v>

1389
01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:10.003
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the main hurdle that everybody </v>

1390
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:14.363
<v Speaker 1>cross country for a long time we drove </v>
<v Speaker 1>to vegas and they're adding more and </v>

1429
01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:14.260
<v Speaker 1>He said he learned about the wiping </v>
<v Speaker 1>technique and he tried it out.</v>

1430
01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:15.913
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately on my third try with </v>
<v Speaker 1>front wiping it ended in such tragedy </v>

1431
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.903
<v Speaker 1>had revert back to back wiping while I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to utilize the scoop </v>
