<v Speaker 2>Guys.</v>

9
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:48.381
<v Speaker 2>We started late today because my day so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far has been pretty messed up.</v>

10
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

11
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

12
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 2>having breakfast this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

13
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 2>getting ready for the day and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see shredder on his little bed next to</v>

14
00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:07.534
<v Speaker 2>the breakfast table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chewing on this weird little blue </v>

15
00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:11.710
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

16
00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does,</v>

17
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.310
<v Speaker 2>what does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does shutter gotten himself into?</v>

18
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.400
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the pickiest eater in the world.</v>

19
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't eat anything but this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

20
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 2>of course you eat this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I pick it up.</v>

21
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:24.034
<v Speaker 2>And what I ended up saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was like maybe a piece of </v>

22
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.793
<v Speaker 2>detergent or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what ended up being was a fricking </v>

23
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.333
<v Speaker 2>adderall pill that was covered in </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic and he was like munch like </v>

24
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:41.960
<v Speaker 2>halfway through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm online looking up like,</v>

25
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

26
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 2>it's adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>

27
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 2>who the hell left adderall on my floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I call the vet,</v>

28
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.300
<v Speaker 2>the vet says call poison control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poison control.</v>

29
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a little guy and the amount that he</v>

30
00:01:55.191 --> 00:02:00.191
<v Speaker 2>ate pretty much crosses right over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>line of being toxic so to like,</v>

31
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:03.924
<v Speaker 2>you need to take him to the vet </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately and induce vomiting and </v>

32
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 2>shoved charcoal down his throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm looking at this sweet little guy</v>

33
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shredder.</v>

34
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Who's the light of my life besides you?</v>

35
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoops.</v>

36
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.483
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

37
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.523
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

38
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.281
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

39
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 2>this guy is going to go through like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>craziest day.</v>

40
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 2>They're going to go pump his stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get in the car because he,</v>

41
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:37.520
<v Speaker 2>he seems fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just basically ate a bunch of crack,</v>

42
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what adderall is.</v>

43
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.180
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in the car driving on the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the vet.</v>

44
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:46.181
<v Speaker 2>He seems fine at halfway there he starts</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaking and crying and he's confused.</v>

45
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 2>He's like panicked and it's apparent </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the drug had,</v>

46
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.840
<v Speaker 2>had started affecting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

47
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like crying because I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fricking scared.</v>

51
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.010

<v Speaker 2>They pumped his stomach.</v>

52
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 2>He's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a sweet little guy.</v>

53
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Point is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry I'm late.</v>

54
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.850
<v Speaker 2>My little guy almost went though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can handle that.</v>

55
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Don't just break you man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

56
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.123
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to Eli about it and she's </v>

57
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything happened,</v>

58
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 2>shredder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God I.</v>

59
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.440
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

60
00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:29.274
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I do because she's over </v>

61
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 2>there to take care of her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of her father who is sick right now.</v>

62
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

63
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 2>he's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

64
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 2>But who walks around with an adderall </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their pocket?</v>

65
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Just free flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just free flying in the pocket.</v>

66
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Any small creature that comes across in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the vet said when he puked,</v>

67
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 2>they found the pill was blue and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>found all these little blue specs like a</v>

68
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 2>ton of the drug and his stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said it's a good thing.</v>

69
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>You brought them right away because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>puked it out and he.</v>

70
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he would have died,</v>

71
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.300
<v Speaker 2>certainly if I didn't catch him eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>it right away,</v>

72
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:12.301
<v Speaker 2>he would have died crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

73
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 2>so that's about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we're late.</v>

74
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that was an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

75
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

76
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I was very upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's okay now and I'm also,</v>

77
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm the wizard of loneliness this week </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Isla has gone.</v>

78
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.100
<v Speaker 2>She's back helping her family and I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly the wizard of loneliness.</v>

79
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Shredder was gone with my parents the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day and I was just sitting there,</v>

80
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.613
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

81
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 2>cast loneliness on myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Level 90 nine.</v>

82
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to entertain and that is what I</v>

83
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:48.244
<v Speaker 2>shall do next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday is the great and wonderful Bo </v>

84
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Burnham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were all super excited to meet and</v>

85
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 2>chat with him and we're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about his amazing film that's coming up.</v>

86
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Very excited about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've got a lot to get to today.</v>

87
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:02.914
<v Speaker 2>We've got the Tan of Khan Khan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took me a while to wrap my head </v>

88
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:11.011
<v Speaker 2>around the icon thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was like a rollercoaster of fraud.</v>

89
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.313
<v Speaker 2>The thing about Taneka,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen a lot of people talking </v>

90
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:16.564
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that Kinda surprised me most </v>

91
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not a lawyer,</v>

92
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I have dealt with a lot of legal stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

93
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 2>is that I'm like damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're off being like,</v>

94
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up,</v>

95
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.210
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people aren't acknowledging</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it seems to be criminal fraud,</v>

96
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.463
<v Speaker 2>like straight up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the FBI might want to say what up </v>

97
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:42.010
<v Speaker 2>to her and a couple of weeks from now I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to get into that,</v>

98
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 2>but first let's break the ice because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to clip.</v>

99
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 2>That might be the best thing I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

100
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to pop that up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the mood set,</v>

101
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 2>get the feeling right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

102
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Being in the trenches solo was a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal dude.</v>

103
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 2>But here we go.</v>

104
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.390
<v Speaker 2>No sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no sound on this.</v>

105
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.560
<v Speaker 2>So this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no sound on this,</v>

106
00:06:08.561 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan?</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

108
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.543
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically what you're seeing is </v>

109
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.310

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're shoplifting and they try to </v>

111
00:06:17.981 --> 00:06:21.490
<v Speaker 2>escape as a police officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he brings her to the doubt.</v>

112
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 2>He brings her down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all kind of having a little orgy</v>

113
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.640
<v Speaker 2>there at the entrance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of just tussling around,</v>

114
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.480
<v Speaker 2>so dude escapes from the police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

115
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.383
<v Speaker 2>He's running into the storage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basically the back area where they </v>

116
00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:37.540
<v Speaker 2>store all the Saudi pops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you can see.</v>

117
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.703
<v Speaker 2>Now this video is so perfectly like shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>and set up and the twists and turns in </v>

00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:45.340
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's throwing halls at the officer.</v>

119
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.620
<v Speaker 2>The officer has a gun pointed at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he do?</v>

120
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.080
<v Speaker 2>He armed himself with a bag of halls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lawson.</v>

121
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting ahead of myself.</v>

122
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.173
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these police officer pants are kind of </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's pretty stylish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did she escape?</v>

126
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.063
<v Speaker 2>This is in Canada by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you need to know if this was an </v>

127
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:06.374
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

140
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:41.384
<v Speaker 2>peanuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His threats sadly did not avail as the </v>

141
00:07:46.991 --> 00:07:50.710
<v Speaker 2>officer was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was better armed than him sadly.</v>

157
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.830
<v Speaker 2>So she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any much use for this guy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Peace.</v>

164
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 2>There's the bag of a spritz that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown at the officer.</v>

165
00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Those already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are evidence.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exhibit C,</v>

167
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 2>did this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

168
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 2>this officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like a real test for him.</v>

169
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you stop a meth head?</v>

170
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:10.683
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

171
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.410
<v Speaker 2>In Canada it's a lot harder to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to enforce the law when you don't have a</v>

172
00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:16.191
<v Speaker 2>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

173
00:09:16.191 --> 00:09:18.710
<v Speaker 2>if this was America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have just executed that guy.</v>

174
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:19.843
<v Speaker 2>He'd be done short video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of sad because instead of having </v>

175
00:09:23.781 --> 00:09:24.614
<v Speaker 2>like a wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost three stooge asked video do </v>

176
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:28.824
<v Speaker 2>enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would just be like drugged homeless </v>

177
00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 2>man was shot dead by Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

178
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.033
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But instead we've got this wonderful </v>

179
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.010
<v Speaker 2>little and it gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Folks.</v>

180
00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:40.844
<v Speaker 2>Stay tuned.</v>

181
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.830
<v Speaker 2>I love the effort by this officer </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

182
00:09:44.831 --> 00:09:46.870
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will not fucking escape me.</v>

183
00:09:46.871 --> 00:09:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back at the ranch,</v>

184
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.103
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

185
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.010
<v Speaker 2>his wife having decided to divorce him </v>
<v Speaker 2>is looking for an escape room.</v>

186
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.490
<v Speaker 2>She goes to the ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>desperation.</v>

187
00:09:57.491 --> 00:09:59.440
<v Speaker 2>My God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is like,</v>

188
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.333
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the hell did they capture this so </v>

189
00:10:03.641 --> 00:10:04.474
<v Speaker 2>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes me suspicious of it </v>

190
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:06.864
<v Speaker 2>being faked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even get the ass shot in there and </v>

191
00:10:08.351 --> 00:10:11.350
<v Speaker 2>the spandex and not saying that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that interests me.</v>

192
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Just simply stating that it is quite an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunistic shot.</v>

193
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is she?</v>

194
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.953
<v Speaker 2>Where did she go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out having a tussle and then </v>

195
00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:28.120
<v Speaker 2>suddenly look who's back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

196
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.130
<v Speaker 2>The girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's back.</v>

197
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.280
<v Speaker 2>She's back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

198
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.003
<v Speaker 2>And aren't we so glad that the Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 2>police force in this very moment aren't </v>

199
00:10:44.771 --> 00:10:49.771
<v Speaker 2>armed and we can enjoy this video she </v>
<v Speaker 2>pops back up to.</v>

200
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.220
<v Speaker 2>It's just so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She dude,</v>

201
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.670
<v Speaker 2>they must be dragged out of their mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she just lives like,</v>

202
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.560
<v Speaker 2>shrugged it off like it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get it.</v>

203
00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Let's get a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get a slow.</v>

204
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.113
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to quarter speed on this one </v>

205
00:11:02.861 --> 00:11:05.320
<v Speaker 2>shelly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as you can see,</v>

206
00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:09.950
<v Speaker 2>she's crawling around the attic space </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to look for an hour and um,</v>

207
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe she had second doubts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she said,</v>

208
00:11:13.211 --> 00:11:16.520
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do Love A.</v>

209
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.943
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think she was trying to do like an </v>

210
00:11:19.001 --> 00:11:19.920
<v Speaker 2>aerial assault?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

211
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:20.763
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

212
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:25.810
<v Speaker 2>She's trying to help out but not quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not quite.</v>

213
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.620
<v Speaker 2>There's tennis balls rolling all over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the place,</v>

214
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just unharmed.</v>

215
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Whatever they're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have one please Christ.</v>

216
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I could use a little invincibility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

217
00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I could barely go up my stairs in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evening,</v>

218
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.230
<v Speaker 2>but be that as it may.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not wearing shoes either,</v>

219
00:11:45.231 --> 00:11:46.640
<v Speaker 2>which I think is interesting to point </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

220
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:47.600
<v Speaker 2>I know she is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

221
00:11:47.601 --> 00:11:51.350
<v Speaker 2>she's missing one shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is missing one shoe,</v>

222
00:11:51.351 --> 00:11:52.184
<v Speaker 2>which is definitely worth pointing out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if she's headed on over to the </v>

223
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:57.370
<v Speaker 2>peanut bags to try to defend her </v>
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend.</v>

224
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Stuck up on ammo stack up on ammo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

225
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:03.910
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listen.</v>

226
00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do anything,</v>

227
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:08.314
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

228
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.583
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

229
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then then,</v>

230
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.330
<v Speaker 2>then the real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real mf or show up and,</v>

231
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.630
<v Speaker 2>and put an end to this rodeo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wasn't that a thrill?</v>

232
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that a thrill?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

233
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.173
<v Speaker 2>Truly a gift from Canada and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>really want to reflect one more time on </v>

234
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.820
<v Speaker 2>an enjoy the fact that they are armed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with tasers and not live.</v>

235
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.841
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they are,</v>

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.340
<v Speaker 2>We should move on to the Tan con.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

264
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.550
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of you guys probably been </v>
<v Speaker 2>following the Tanach on thing.</v>

265
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people have talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it by now,</v>

266
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:16.321
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want to get too much into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nitty gritty.</v>

267
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was trying to do,</v>

268
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:20.434
<v Speaker 2>because I was going through all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>information last night and w and the </v>

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.830
<v Speaker 2>What does this stand first of all from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane's documentary documentaries?</v>

354
00:18:48.831 --> 00:18:52.730
<v Speaker 2>A clip of her blog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that video is just,</v>

355
00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:53.564
<v Speaker 2>for some reason timestamp wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go to the very beginning of that </v>

356
00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:56.060
<v Speaker 2>video and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

357
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a nice little summary of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

358
00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.450
<v Speaker 2>her mission statement,</v>

359
00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:09.483
<v Speaker 5>all of the rebels people and all of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>unwanted people should host a little </v>

360
00:19:14.291 --> 00:19:15.124
<v Speaker 5>meet and greet in Anaheim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>California on the same days as a bit </v>

361
00:19:17.891 --> 00:19:19.480
<v Speaker 5>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to do it.</v>

362
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:20.600
<v Speaker 5>I would love</v>

363
00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:25.790
<v Speaker 2>you all $65 to come to this rebellious </v>
<v Speaker 2>little convention of ours,</v>

364
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:27.923
<v Speaker 2>which stick it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll stick it to those capitalists at </v>

365
00:19:31.491 --> 00:19:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Vidcon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets so good.</v>

366
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:36.950
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's selling.</v>

367
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.570
<v Speaker 2>So what she actually pitches is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the tickets are going to be free</v>

368
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.290
<v Speaker 2>and there's only going to be a few VIP </v>
<v Speaker 2>tickets.</v>

369
00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:46.124
<v Speaker 2>What is essentially a free event?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who buy VIP tickets get to skip </v>

370
00:19:49.881 --> 00:19:50.714
<v Speaker 2>the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get three times worth the ticket </v>

371
00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:58.301
<v Speaker 2>price and a goody bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the VIP tickets were $65.</v>

372
00:19:58.941 --> 00:20:03.110
<v Speaker 2>So essentially she's saying the goody </v>
<v Speaker 2>bags can be worth about 200 bucks.</v>

373
00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:03.973
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's go ahead and look through the </v>

374
00:20:06.051 --> 00:20:10.460
<v Speaker 2>goody bag that the VIP people get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And guys really stick around here.</v>

375
00:20:10.461 --> 00:20:13.970
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was the most prominent,</v>

376
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
<v Speaker 2>probably the most valuable item.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there went the Fuck I paid $20 for a</v>

377
00:20:19.281 --> 00:20:19.970
<v Speaker 2>condom.</v>

378
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.510
<v Speaker 2>The condom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

379
00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Seventy five guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dyslexic.</v>

380
00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.173
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of packaged like an after </v>

381
00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:31.880
<v Speaker 2>dinner mint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

382
00:20:31.881 --> 00:20:34.070
<v Speaker 2>what's the best part about them giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>out condoms?</v>

383
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Is that everyone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's 12.</v>

384
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.213
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also imagine actually using this </v>

385
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.680
<v Speaker 2>condom and then finding out that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>

386
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.140
<v Speaker 2>it's not a real condom breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

387
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Like is there a little disclaimer that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

388
00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:48.064
<v Speaker 2>this is actually an after dinner mint </v>
<v Speaker 2>packaging and not meant to conceal up </v>

389
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.130
<v Speaker 2>something as important as a condom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many like uh,</v>

390
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:55.993
<v Speaker 2>unplanned births or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or infectious diseases were passed </v>

391
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.230
<v Speaker 2>thanks to her Tana condom by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's so good that like con,</v>

392
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.380
<v Speaker 2>the Tan con,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

393
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.180
<v Speaker 2>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

394
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.253
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was basically the highlight of the </v>

395
00:21:12.241 --> 00:21:13.950
<v Speaker 2>good of the $200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goodie bag.</v>

396
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a video of a girl on boxing.</v>

397
00:21:18.091 --> 00:21:18.924
<v Speaker 2>Her Goodie bag</v>

398
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.920
<v Speaker 6>stickers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kida Kida.</v>

399
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.540
<v Speaker 6>Not from family guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pete.</v>

400
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.453
<v Speaker 6>It's sounds sponsored by Jason Nash.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he's nowhere to be found good </v>

401
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.600
<v Speaker 6>princess,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I can't afford that because I wasted</v>

402
00:21:34.601 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 6>my money on a ticket.</v>

403
00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They included some broke ass.</v>

404
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Gucci Princess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety nine cent like wristband.</v>

405
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:46.050
<v Speaker 2>Like okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so Gucci Princess.</v>

406
00:21:46.051 --> 00:21:46.884
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that any of these little </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls spending $65 for a vip pass can </v>

407
00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:51.480
<v Speaker 2>afford Gucci?</v>

408
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:53.883
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

409
00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.540
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cozy free shopping guy.</v>

410
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:03.263
<v Speaker 2>Clearly it's just a bunch of garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's essentially they basically </v>

411
00:22:05.761 --> 00:22:08.340
<v Speaker 2>put a bunch of shit in a bag and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you throw this out for us.</v>

412
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.370
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it gets good folks here.</v>

413
00:22:13.371 --> 00:22:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's keep going.</v>

414
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.860
<v Speaker 2>So the day of it's pure chaos outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gets into the convention,</v>

415
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.380
<v Speaker 2>which turns out to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

416
00:22:21.381 --> 00:22:22.214
<v Speaker 2>just a Marriott events room that has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximum capacity of a thousand and the </v>

417
00:22:27.141 --> 00:22:27.974
<v Speaker 2>creators can't even get into the room </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's so unsafe because it's so </v>

418
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.680
<v Speaker 2>chaotic and uncontrolled outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carol,</v>

419
00:22:33.681 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Speaker 2>let me give you a view of basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

420
00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't look.</v>

421
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.840
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see there's just like a winding.</v>

422
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like the whole parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

423
00:22:46.721 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Speaker 2>nobody can get inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

424
00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.230
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like 4,000</v>

425
00:22:50.231 --> 00:22:51.880
<v Speaker 2>people outside or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

426
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:57.390
<v Speaker 2>so the funny part about basically this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that thousands of people are outside.</v>

427
00:22:59.821 --> 00:23:00.654
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're supposed to be a VIP ticket </v>

428
00:23:03.721 --> 00:23:07.770
<v Speaker 2>line for people who got the VIP ticket </v>
<v Speaker 2>to skip in front of the free tickets.</v>

429
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:08.933
<v Speaker 2>But everybody out there who's waiting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>line for four to six hours in the </v>

430
00:23:12.481 --> 00:23:15.030
<v Speaker 2>blazing heat without any food or water </v>
<v Speaker 2>being offered,</v>

431
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:16.763
<v Speaker 2>there's actually footage of ambulance </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fire trucks coming and rescuing </v>

432
00:23:18.781 --> 00:23:19.614
<v Speaker 2>people from getting each stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody who's outside is starting to </v>

433
00:23:22.621 --> 00:23:23.454
<v Speaker 2>realize</v>

434
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:25.883
<v Speaker 2>they all have a VIP ticket because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was pitched like mostly free and maybe </v>

435
00:23:31.941 --> 00:23:32.774
<v Speaker 2>like 300 vip for people who really care </v>
<v Speaker 2>and want to make sure they meet </v>

436
00:23:35.511 --> 00:23:38.000
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody out there,</v>

437
00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:40.070
<v Speaker 2>they're starting realized has a VIP </v>
<v Speaker 2>ticket.</v>

438
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start claiming that there was </v>

439
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:51.170
<v Speaker 2>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people outside.</v>

440
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.740
<v Speaker 2>This is the genius that organized the </v>
<v Speaker 2>event.</v>

441
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:56.743

<v Speaker 2>Can't say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you need to say?</v>

<v Speaker 2>convention and that's why we have to </v>

470
00:25:19.391 --> 00:25:23.530
<v Speaker 2>shut it down here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says that Bella,</v>

471
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Bella and I are coming out to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

472
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Everything is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fire marshal stuff,</v>

473
00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:30.544
<v Speaker 2>keeping it safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I won't do that voice adding a </v>

474
00:25:34.481 --> 00:25:35.314
<v Speaker 2>third day or if worse comes to worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will be down to personally refund </v>

475
00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.330
<v Speaker 2>anyone who still upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one expected.</v>

476
00:25:40.331 --> 00:25:41.830
<v Speaker 2>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in my loves.</v>

477
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's just like,</v>

478
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no big deal.</v>

479
00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:46.750
<v Speaker 2>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people showed up.</v>

480
00:25:46.751 --> 00:25:47.584
<v Speaker 2>Everyone understands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is that the police report </v>

481
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:58.020
<v Speaker 2>issued that same day says there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>4,000,</v>

482
00:25:58.151 --> 00:26:01.000
<v Speaker 2>four to 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people there at Max,</v>

483
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.833
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

484
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.590
<v Speaker 2>four to 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people at Max,</v>

485
00:26:07.591 --> 00:26:11.580
<v Speaker 2>which turns out is the exact number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>VIP tickets they sold.</v>

486
00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:12.743
<v Speaker 2>So literally the same amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed up as bought tickets and they're </v>

487
00:26:17.521 --> 00:26:18.354
<v Speaker 2>trying to paint it like 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people showed up and that's why we're </v>

488
00:26:20.731 --> 00:26:21.564
<v Speaker 2>shutting it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is they oversold the </v>

489
00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:27.630
<v Speaker 2>convention with a 1000 seat capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>5,000</v>

490
00:26:27.631 --> 00:26:30.060
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the police report,</v>

491
00:26:30.061 --> 00:26:34.050
<v Speaker 2>because Tana and his production company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kept trying to spin this narrative of</v>

492
00:26:34.051 --> 00:26:36.210
<v Speaker 2>like so many people show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we had to shut it down,</v>

493
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.970
<v Speaker 2>so here's the actual official police </v>
<v Speaker 2>report.</v>

494
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.223
<v Speaker 2>Garden Grove Police Department officers </v>
<v Speaker 2>were sent to Marriott suites to assist </v>

495
00:26:43.921 --> 00:26:44.754
<v Speaker 2>hotel staff and security with crowd </v>
<v Speaker 2>control and dispersal of unruly hotel </v>

496
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:48.774
<v Speaker 2>guests from the hotel property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tanach con convention was an event </v>

497
00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:54.030
<v Speaker 2>hosted by Tannic on company at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marriott Suites Hotel.</v>

498
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.480
<v Speaker 2>The organizing group for Tenneco was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>company called good times promotion.</v>

499
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.373
<v Speaker 2>Promotions event was scheduled to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>meet and greet sessions between youtube </v>

500
00:27:01.021 --> 00:27:01.854
<v Speaker 2>celebrities in their fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were concert concerts and dj </v>

501
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:09.180
<v Speaker 2>scheduled reform for fans in the bar </v>
<v Speaker 2>room starting at one or 10:00</v>

502
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.790
<v Speaker 2>AM.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 ICAN had sold approximately 40,000</v>

503
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:12.624
<v Speaker 2>tickets at the time of the event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The skip on down the hotel ballroom </v>

504
00:27:17.971 --> 00:27:21.510
<v Speaker 2>where the event was scheduled could hold</v>
<v Speaker 2>a maximum of 1000 people.</v>

505
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.903
<v Speaker 2>The organized planned the organizers </v>
<v Speaker 2>plans to move the crowd in and out of </v>

506
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:29.580
<v Speaker 2>the venue to allow all attendees the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to participate in that.</v>

507
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.713
<v Speaker 2>As the crowd moved through the venue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were herded into the lobby after a </v>

508
00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:35.760
<v Speaker 2>short time to allow other fans into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ballroom.</v>

509
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 2>People moved into the lobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're upset and refuse to leave.</v>

510
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.890
<v Speaker 2>As the crowd grew in the lobby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hotel staff and event security,</v>

511
00:27:41.891 --> 00:27:44.340
<v Speaker 2>you cannot gain compliance from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fans,</v>

512
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 2>so they're like overflowing into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hotel lobby.</v>

513
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.550
<v Speaker 2>But essentially what's important is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the police specifically state that there</v>

514
00:27:55.551 --> 00:27:57.500
<v Speaker 2>was four to 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people there,</v>

515
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.920
<v Speaker 2>approximately 20 officers and several </v>
<v Speaker 2>supervisors responded to the scene.</v>

516
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.473
<v Speaker 2>Dude wasting the time of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially an entire police force to </v>

517
00:28:11.031 --> 00:28:11.864
<v Speaker 2>disperse this absolute mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The police supervisors on scene to </v>

518
00:28:15.211 --> 00:28:17.660
<v Speaker 2>estimate the crowd was between four to </v>
<v Speaker 2>5,000</v>

519
00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:19.910
<v Speaker 2>social media sites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had the crowd was 20,000</v>

520
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.880
<v Speaker 2>and this was not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The police officers were made,</v>

521
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.990
<v Speaker 2>were able to disperse the crowd after </v>
<v Speaker 2>approximately 60 to 90 minutes.</v>

522
00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.003
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The exact amount of people showed up as </v>

523
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 2>tickets sold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

524
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 2>who could have predicted?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

525
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would have ever seen that coming?</v>

526
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.030
<v Speaker 2>This is the part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait,</v>

527
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I want to show this one scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

528
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.750
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really important seeing here,</v>

529
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.870
<v Speaker 2>but this is from Shane's documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he,</v>

530
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:52.220
<v Speaker 2>he did a lot of the leg work on this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really good,</v>

531
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.520
<v Speaker 2>but this is footage they took while they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were planning David their con.</v>

532
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.540
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to this,</v>

533
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:06.130
<v Speaker 4>but obviously I haven't said it 50 to </v>
<v Speaker 4>100 right now.</v>

534
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.290
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For us,</v>

535
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.780
<v Speaker 4>I kind of just like set no capacity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just like,</v>

536
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.633
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to sell out.</v>

537
00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.970
<v Speaker 4>We sell now because I feel like there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a chance</v>

538
00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:20.890
<v Speaker 2>everything about God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that for us.</v>

539
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.943
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hotel is set at a thousand but I </v>

540
00:29:26.351 --> 00:29:30.250
<v Speaker 2>have it set at $5,200</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she bears witness to that and says I</v>

541
00:29:30.251 --> 00:29:31.084
<v Speaker 2>love that for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically conspiracy to commit </v>

542
00:29:35.141 --> 00:29:35.974
<v Speaker 2>fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is straight up just </v>

543
00:29:38.171 --> 00:29:40.060
<v Speaker 2>acknowledging that they're overselling </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

544
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.790
<v Speaker 2>the event by 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>seats.</v>

545
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 2>This is the part at the end of Shane's </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary where he's just like,</v>

546
00:29:46.991 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the raw facts.</v>

547
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.073
<v Speaker 2>So here you go.</v>

548
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.930
<v Speaker 7>So I still had a lot of questions about </v>
<v Speaker 7>pretty much everything.</v>

549
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:56.510
<v Speaker 7>So I called Michael and Michael's dad</v>

550
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.473
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

551
00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.520
<v Speaker 2>is the event organizers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

552
00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.373
<v Speaker 2>The segway kit,</v>

553
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.480
<v Speaker 7>that's the official number of VIP </v>
<v Speaker 7>tickets sold was 5,108.</v>

554
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.940
<v Speaker 7>The number of free tickets was between </v>
<v Speaker 7>two and 300</v>

555
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:14.813
<v Speaker 2>clusivity baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just think that everybody's a </v>

556
00:30:18.331 --> 00:30:21.570
<v Speaker 2>featured fucking creator as long as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay me $65.</v>

557
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised 300 people get free </v>
<v Speaker 2>tickets.</v>

558
00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.980
<v Speaker 7>Claims that Tana knew that and that she </v>
<v Speaker 7>was lying when she was at.</v>

559
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.340
<v Speaker 7>She still says she didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The number of security guards,</v>

560
00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.473
<v Speaker 7>was it never 91.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got ahold of the contract and it said </v>

561
00:30:35.271 --> 00:30:36.104
<v Speaker 7>that at most there was 25 security </v>
<v Speaker 7>guards kind of put that in perspective </v>

562
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.820
<v Speaker 7>for most conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's usually 50 guards per 5,000</v>

563
00:30:43.821 --> 00:30:45.440
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So this was cut in half.</v>

564
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.100
<v Speaker 7>The amount of money spent on security </v>
<v Speaker 7>was $60,000.</v>

565
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.233
<v Speaker 7>To put that in perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the amount of money that they'd gone </v>

566
00:30:51.981 --> 00:30:56.850
<v Speaker 7>spend on security is $1,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is the big one.</v>

567
00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.633
<v Speaker 7>So I got ahold of the contract between </v>
<v Speaker 7>the Marriott and good times and the </v>

568
00:31:01.581 --> 00:31:02.414
<v Speaker 7>contract stated that there was only </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to be 1000 people in Michael </v>

569
00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.220
<v Speaker 7>signed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not Tana and Michael about this.</v>

570
00:31:10.221 --> 00:31:13.520
<v Speaker 7>And they both said that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the contract might've said it a thousand</v>

571
00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.353
<v Speaker 7>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but everybody at Mary I've told them </v>

572
00:31:15.411 --> 00:31:18.080
<v Speaker 7>that that was just the safe number in </v>
<v Speaker 7>that $5,000.</v>

573
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.580
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

574
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so stupid.</v>

575
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.473
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they literally had a room with a max </v>

576
00:31:23.861 --> 00:31:25.260
<v Speaker 2>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

577
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.770
<v Speaker 2>you've worked with like um,</v>

578
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:30.350
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of venues and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they tell you,</v>

579
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.100
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

580
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:36.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a thousand maximum capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just no fucking way.</v>

581
00:31:36.471 --> 00:31:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

582
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.710
<v Speaker 2>No way in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

583
00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.053
<v Speaker 2>Just also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's kind of a big fucking </v>

584
00:31:42.951 --> 00:31:46.520
<v Speaker 2>difference from 1000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe 1300 bucks,</v>

585
00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.420
<v Speaker 2>100 over maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even then though,</v>

586
00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.600
<v Speaker 2>they would never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

587
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:51.703
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they would like turn a blind eye to </v>

588
00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:53.624
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would never say that because </v>

589
00:31:54.321 --> 00:31:56.540
<v Speaker 2>they're liable like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

590
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:59.270
<v Speaker 2>It's Marriott,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge corporation and not going to</v>

591
00:31:59.271 --> 00:31:59.990
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

592
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.950
<v Speaker 2>5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine,</v>

593
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 2>that's the part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Mario,</v>

594
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:03.263
<v Speaker 2>it's not some amateurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small hotel and they don't give a fuck </v>

595
00:32:07.281 --> 00:32:08.570
<v Speaker 2>about Tana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

596
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.240
<v Speaker 2>like they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have events there every day.</v>

597
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.070
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just routine to them and there's</v>

598
00:32:13.071 --> 00:32:15.080
<v Speaker 2>just no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way that's real.</v>

599
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:16.303
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the part that really gets like </v>

600
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:23.280
<v Speaker 2>hearing saying the capacity is 1200.</v>

601
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.270
<v Speaker 7>Even if there was no issues,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no drama,</v>

602
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.850
<v Speaker 7>no whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It wouldn't have worked.</v>

603
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.660
<v Speaker 7>There's no way that 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>people could fit there.</v>

604
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:34.683
<v Speaker 7>There is no way that 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>people would have had this wasn't gonna </v>

605
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 7>work,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but what is capacity</v>

606
00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:45.580
<v Speaker 4>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But obviously I haven't said it.</v>

607
00:32:45.581 --> 00:32:48.800
<v Speaker 4>Fifty 200 right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that for us.</v>

608
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.510
<v Speaker 4>I also though capacity,</v>

609
00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.250
<v Speaker 2>why she'd been looking there like a mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

610
00:32:55.251 --> 00:32:57.560
<v Speaker 2>she's 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That blew me away.</v>

611
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:03.250
<v Speaker 2>She's 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looks like she's going on her second</v>

612
00:33:03.671 --> 00:33:04.504
<v Speaker 2>marriage already.</v>

613
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:07.451
<v Speaker 4>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

614
00:33:07.451 --> 00:33:08.300
<v Speaker 4>we're going to sell out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We sell</v>

615
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.560
<v Speaker 2>coked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like rubbing or no,</v>

616
00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's a chance everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>

617
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:15.963
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that that really like just </v>

618
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 2>actually irks me about this is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane,</v>

619
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Shane did an amazing job on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>

620
00:33:23.531 --> 00:33:26.150
<v Speaker 2>like showing all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he did not pull punches,</v>

621
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:30.020
<v Speaker 2>but in a way it is also a way for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to save face and be like,</v>

622
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.630
<v Speaker 2>we confronted it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about it,</v>

623
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.960
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is they straight up appear</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be committing a fraud.</v>

624
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 2>They collected like $325,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>from these kids.</v>

625
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.960
<v Speaker 2>The convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

626
00:33:44.961 --> 00:33:49.961
<v Speaker 2>completely shut down like nobody got in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's the great part.</v>

627
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's been refunded,</v>

628

<v Speaker 2>this startup,</v>

631
00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:09.410
<v Speaker 2>a ticketing company said that they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>not issue refunds any,</v>

634
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.630
<v Speaker 2>It's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then here,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fraud.</v>

643
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:52.623
<v Speaker 2>I would not be surprised if the FBI </v>
<v Speaker 2>police come knocking at their door and </v>

650
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:19.210
<v Speaker 8>Walking from venue to venue crying,</v>

662
00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.793
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl Bella Thorne that she's </v>

<v Speaker 2>they're both 20 dude.</v>

664
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.320
<v Speaker 2>That's more mind blowing than even the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fraud itself.</v>

665
00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.210
<v Speaker 2>Those girls and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this comes off road,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

667
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:08.583
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those girls have a lot of mileage on </v>

668
00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:14.560
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like 20 going on 30,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's a Tan AECON brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

700
00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

701
00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to plan B it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat it,</v>

702
00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:53.020
<v Speaker 2>beat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The time the condom broke.</v>

703
00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.420
<v Speaker 2>That was the one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

704
00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.113
<v Speaker 2>Tana contract probably have included a </v>
<v Speaker 2>low plan being her goodie bag just in </v>

705
00:37:59.921 --> 00:38:01.960
<v Speaker 2>case I needed a plan B for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>convention.</v>

706
00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Her parents needed a plan B if I'm being</v>
<v Speaker 2>honest.</v>

707
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Yikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

708
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.083
<v Speaker 2>it turns out the con and Tana con as has</v>
<v Speaker 2>a double meaning in this casing as both </v>

709
00:38:16.811 --> 00:38:17.644
<v Speaker 2>a convention and a literal con.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have a couple of bonus clips for </v>

710
00:38:22.271 --> 00:38:23.800
<v Speaker 2>you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's really nothing to say,</v>

711
00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:25.930
<v Speaker 2>but I felt stupid even talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>

712
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.073
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating in that it was such a </v>

713
00:38:29.501 --> 00:38:30.334
<v Speaker 2>train wreck and presumably they put this</v>
<v Speaker 2>event together almost without even a </v>

714
00:38:36.401 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 2>thought to what would actually happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day of,</v>

715
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:46.050
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so irresponsible that sent 5,000</v>

716
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:47.284
<v Speaker 2>fucking people and almost a not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they thought as long as I booked </v>

717
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 2>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

718
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:54.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you build it,</v>

719
00:38:54.821 --> 00:38:59.821
<v Speaker 2>they will come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a movie you need.</v>

720
00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.650
<v Speaker 2>You need another audience out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

721
00:39:01.651 --> 00:39:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need.</v>

722
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like mind numbingly insane.</v>

723
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:08.683
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would not be surprised if a week we see </v>

724
00:39:12.271 --> 00:39:13.670
<v Speaker 2>some jail time for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm being.</v>

725
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:15.090
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I swear to God,</v>

726
00:39:15.091 --> 00:39:15.924
<v Speaker 2>I'm being honest.</v>

727
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 2>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be surprised.</v>

728
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.073
<v Speaker 2>Well the big thing is this Michael Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least according to Shane's </v>

729
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:23.913
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he signed on the dotted line for </v>

730
00:39:26.231 --> 00:39:27.640
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

731
00:39:27.641 --> 00:39:28.390
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>

732
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:32.620
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

733
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.593
<v Speaker 2>I think she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one clip alone proves that she has </v>

734
00:39:37.271 --> 00:39:39.700
<v Speaker 2>like a conspiracy to commit fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

735
00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:42.100
<v Speaker 2>For us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is going to play in a courtroom.</v>

736
00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.580
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a judge and a jury </v>
<v Speaker 2>at watching 10 ago.</v>

737
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I love that for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the judge is going to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's got a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got the.</v>

1046
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:59.260
<v Speaker 2>He's got the literal face of a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably has baby for skin factory.</v>

1047
00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:03.160
<v Speaker 2>You know how they like a farm silk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy farms for skinny.</v>

1048
00:57:03.161 --> 00:57:03.994
<v Speaker 2>He's probably got babies on chains and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he and they've got super regenerative </v>

1049
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:08.560
<v Speaker 2>for skin.</v>

1050
00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:13.300
<v Speaker 2>They're like a new breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they got super regenerative for skin</v>

1051
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:17.290
<v Speaker 2>that he just snips and rubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually what?</v>

1052
00:57:17.291 --> 00:57:18.880
<v Speaker 2>He rubs his shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shoe magma,</v>

1053
00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:19.953
<v Speaker 2>not actually the force can buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This magma is the residue and dirt that </v>

1054
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:25.300
<v Speaker 2>collects when you don't clean inside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>force gun.</v>

1055
00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.130
<v Speaker 2>The other problem I have because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish,</v>

1056
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.233
<v Speaker 2>but he probably does rub that magma </v>
<v Speaker 2>oliver his fucking face and that's why </v>

1057
00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:32.914
<v Speaker 2>it looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it looks like a 50 year old </v>

1058
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.433
<v Speaker 2>gerber baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always hated that guy's face added </v>

1059
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:43.270
<v Speaker 2>even more know what a piece of shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1060
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:47.110
<v Speaker 2>he's doing the groping and then like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment where she finally reacts.</v>

1061
00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.210
<v Speaker 2>He's just like jiggling it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's just like,</v>

1062
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:55.150
<v Speaker 2>it's a man's world baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is this guy still have a job?</v>

1063
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:58.870
<v Speaker 2>That's my question because I found this </v>
<v Speaker 2>clip and it just resurface.</v>

1064
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:59.860
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is like really bad and I'm looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>

<v Speaker 2>evidence of,</v>

1067
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 2>of him being reprimanded for this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing there.</v>

1068
00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:19.360
<v Speaker 2>When he to look in his basement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that there's like giant bottles</v>

1071
00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:24.481
<v Speaker 2>of milk and these super regenerative </v>
<v Speaker 2>force can babies in his basement.</v>

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:30.370
<v Speaker 2>He selling these two Chinese patrons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used them as Viagra.</v>

1073
00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:32.613
<v Speaker 2>The Chinese will do anything to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulate their sex and you know I'm </v>

1074
00:58:35.651 --> 00:58:36.484
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the fuckers straight up kill </v>

1076
00:58:41.801 --> 00:58:43.300

<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work by the way,</v>

1077
00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:47.840
<v Speaker 2>but they still kill them all and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure you tried it until you try it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1079

<v Speaker 2>there is no medical value and ground up </v>

1080
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 2>toenails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically what it is.</v>

1081
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.530
<v Speaker 2>But I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Chinese to go on a little tangent,</v>

00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:58.730
<v Speaker 2>it's like you know that there's Viagara </v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1083
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.410
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to go fucking kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>endangered species anymore.</v>

1084
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:03.363
<v Speaker 2>And Lou Walsh,</v>

00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Jerks and do is rack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts it back in his pocket.</v>

1092
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:31.670

01:00:07.151 --> 01:00:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Cow Cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is the epicenter.</v>

1112
01:00:25.451 --> 01:00:26.284
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These rich billionaires have the most </v>

1113
01:00:27.311 --> 01:00:28.144
<v Speaker 2>fucking twisted like fetishes because </v>
<v Speaker 2>like nothing gets you off at that level </v>

1114
01:00:33.041 --> 01:00:35.890
<v Speaker 2>of wealth and power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does Simon callow get off on?</v>

1115
01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:38.860
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to know.</v>

1116
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:40.583
<v Speaker 2>He just beats people to death for sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just grinds up bodies and then puts </v>

1117
01:00:48.041 --> 01:00:51.130
<v Speaker 2>them into a sausage tubing and fucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself with it.</v>

1118
01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.020
<v Speaker 2>That's vulgar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1119
01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's all right.</v>

1120
01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Let's move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We dissect it.</v>

1121
01:00:59.231 --> 01:01:00.610
<v Speaker 2>I think that's accurate though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for the record.</v>

1122
01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Look at his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be surprised if he shoving,</v>

1123
01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:04.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>body parts of his ass.</v>

1124
01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.390
<v Speaker 2>What else would get along?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get him off.</v>

1125
01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Does he react at all during this clip?</v>

1126
01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.350
<v Speaker 6>What is his reaction to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he looks disgusted.</v>

1127
01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.740
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know that he saw necessarily.</v>

1128
01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:21.490
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't.</v>

1129
01:01:21.491 --> 01:01:22.324
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he necessarily knows </v>

1130
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:28.223
<v Speaker 6>everyone's joking around because they </v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't see how free that's going to be </v>

1131
01:01:30.081 --> 01:01:31.100
<v Speaker 6>really frustrated for</v>

1132
01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:31.933
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot of courage to on live TV </v>

1133
01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:34.820
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

1134
01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah.</v>

1135
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:37.993
<v Speaker 2>And nobody saw what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard to be supportive of her </v>

1136
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:42.463
<v Speaker 2>right in that moment that the on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>couch don't necessarily see how severe </v>

1137
01:01:45.111 --> 01:01:46.480
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just God bless her,</v>

1138
01:01:46.481 --> 01:01:48.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and God bless her.</v>

1139
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.710
<v Speaker 2>That's all I can say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1140
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:51.380
<v Speaker 2>fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's moving on.</v>

1141
01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:52.533
<v Speaker 2>She does spice girl in my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got a lot of spice and she has a </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically like the Judaism version </v>

1237
01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:22.804

01:12:12.401 --> 01:12:16.880
<v Speaker 7>We're doing a live debate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm curious.</v>

1348
01:12:16.881 --> 01:12:18.830
<v Speaker 7>I'm actually curious about your real </v>
<v Speaker 7>estate jobs.</v>

1349
01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:21.920
<v Speaker 7>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so give me the formula for a cap rate.</v>

1350
01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.790
<v Speaker 7>Can you define what a cap rate is?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So real.</v>

1351
01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.100
<v Speaker 7>Let's talk about real estate for a </v>
<v Speaker 7>second.</v>

1352
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:25.970
<v Speaker 7>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1353
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:26.171
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1354
01:12:26.171 --> 01:12:26.391
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

01:12:29.301 --> 01:12:31.130
<v Speaker 7>Do you know what a cap rate is?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>

1357

<v Speaker 2>and for once this guy really hold them </v>

1358
01:12:36.011 --> 01:12:37.180
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

1359
01:12:37.181 --> 01:12:38.014
<v Speaker 2>but I assume it's probably some </v>
<v Speaker 2>elementary thing that if you know </v>

1360
01:12:39.881 --> 01:12:42.250
<v Speaker 2>anything about real estate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should know what this is.</v>

1365
01:12:58.230 --> 01:13:02.810
<v Speaker 7>They call it cap rate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's very similar formula or a Capri.</v>

1366
01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:03.780
<v Speaker 7>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>John,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

01:14:32.571 --> 01:14:34.400
<v Speaker 2>They held his feet to the fire and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>got them good.</v>

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get him on here.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Tell me about Mark Twain backed from the</v>

1395
01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:46.250
<v Speaker 2>two volumes of Mark Twain's </v>
<v Speaker 2>autobiography.</v>

1396
01:14:46.251 --> 01:14:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me a freaking break.</v>

1397
01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.520
<v Speaker 2>I love Mark Twain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't read that shit,</v>

1398
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:53.540
<v Speaker 2>but that's just me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1399
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Let's get to the putting the pudding </v>
<v Speaker 2>pie.</v>

1400
01:14:55.731 --> 01:14:57.500
<v Speaker 2>We've got a key lime pie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fresh.</v>

1401
01:14:57.501 --> 01:15:00.460
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say maybe an American Apple Pie.</v>

1402
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Warm out of the oven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good enough to put your Dick in.</v>

1403
01:15:09.150 --> 01:15:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Apple Pie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>American pie.</v>

1404
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:16.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm KSI versus Logan Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I will say this.</v>

1405
01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:17.603
<v Speaker 2>I actually like Ksi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really have a problem with this </v>

1406
01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:24.620
<v Speaker 2>for you guys who don't know Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul and everyone knows the Logan Paul's</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was Scott,</v>

1408
01:15:27.511 --> 01:15:31.980
<v Speaker 2>big plank FIFA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's kind of like the English pewdie</v>

1409
01:15:31.981 --> 01:15:32.814
<v Speaker 2>pie in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of just makes videos about </v>

<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very popular.</v>

<v Speaker 2>another person who we won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now there's this whole big thing </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's such a circus.</v>

1415
01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be on youtube.</v>

1416
01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.680
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what it's devolved into.</v>

1417
01:15:55.681 --> 01:16:00.681
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing genuine left with very </v>
<v Speaker 2>few channels of a genuine left.</v>

1418
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I actually liked those guys,</v>

1424
01:16:27.251 --> 01:16:29.560
<v Speaker 2>but this whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just such a circus.</v>

1425
01:16:29.561 --> 01:16:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Like let me show you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't fought yet,</v>

<v Speaker 2>from the event.</v>

<v Speaker 12>Do you don't have one idea that is going</v>

1429
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:51.500
<v Speaker 12>to set up his camera.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I've got something familiar.</v>

1430
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:04.501
<v Speaker 2>Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul,</v>

<v Speaker 2>The great white hope.</v>

1435
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Just a white boy from Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that means.</v>

1436
01:17:24.370 --> 01:17:25.700
<v Speaker 2>There was a movie called that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1437
01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I just made some racial </v>
<v Speaker 2>implications.</v>

1438
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.420
<v Speaker 2>So strike that from the record,</v>

1439
01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:33.653
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1440
01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.300
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are you guys?</v>

1441
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:38.010
<v Speaker 2>Look at Logan and Jake Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1442
01:17:38.011 --> 01:17:38.844
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing genuine about these </v>

1443
01:17:41.821 --> 01:17:43.920
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're flying in the wind.</v>

1444
01:17:44.190 --> 01:17:45.023
<v Speaker 2>They don't know who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the people that youtube </v>

1445
01:17:48.151 --> 01:17:48.984
<v Speaker 2>selects to promote and highlight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>endorse and I don't know what it is by </v>

1446
01:17:52.531 --> 01:17:55.110
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like survival of the fittest</v>

1447
01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:55.973
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have to be this </v>

1448
01:17:58.030 --> 01:18:01.260
<v Speaker 2>inauthentic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a oil slick.</v>

1449
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:06.480
<v Speaker 2>The floats in the water to rise to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top is very rare.</v>

1450
01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Very few exceptions have youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>channels that actually rise above,</v>

1451
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.903
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1452
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:17.130
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and find success that are not this.</v>

1453
01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:22.700
<v Speaker 12>What the fuck is he saying,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Hey,</v>

1454
01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.170
<v Speaker 2>let me say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just,</v>

1455
01:18:28.171 --> 01:18:30.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep this running because I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even care what they're saying.</v>

1456
01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:33.780
<v Speaker 2>It's so obvious that they're pretending </v>
<v Speaker 2>to play a role.</v>

1457
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:34.723
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to even be surprised from being </v>

1458
01:18:36.631 --> 01:18:37.464
<v Speaker 2>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If these guys talked regularly on the </v>

1459
01:18:40.501 --> 01:18:43.860
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent just colluding,</v>

1460
01:18:43.861 --> 01:18:44.694
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make this the biggest event ever </v>

1461
01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:50.220
<v Speaker 2>because their whole thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be make rager averse.</v>

1462
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Mayfield bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they're presenting it.</v>

1463
01:18:53.850 --> 01:18:54.683
<v Speaker 2>This is crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you these guys talk on the phone </v>

1464
01:18:58.050 --> 01:19:01.920
<v Speaker 2>and they just jerk off about how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>money they're gonna make and on one hand</v>

1465
01:19:01.921 --> 01:19:06.921
<v Speaker 2>I have to respect the brilliance of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a boxing match.</v>

1466
01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:10.230
<v Speaker 2>I think it is somewhat of a brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 2>move,</v>

1467
01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's like Logan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Are you the lovable child entertainer?</v>

1470
01:19:21.150 --> 01:19:21.983

<v Speaker 2>He looks like</v>

1473
01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:33.010
<v Speaker 2>he looks like a door to door salesman </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going bald at early age.</v>

1474
01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:37.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

1505
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I can't beat up anybody and I fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge that.</v>

1506
01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.200
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1508
01:21:33.901 --> 01:21:35.970

1509
01:21:35.971 --> 01:21:37.170
<v Speaker 2>like as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an adult.</v>

1517
01:21:51.371 --> 01:21:53.750
<v Speaker 2>I set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I could take Jimmy Lee.</v>

1518
01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pay for that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Somebody just said Roy in our chat.</v>

1520
01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:04.720
<v Speaker 2>Roy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1521
01:22:04.721 --> 01:22:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Roy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's Roy?</v>

1522
01:22:06.851 --> 01:22:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1523
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:09.850

<v Speaker 2>I think this is the toy channel.</v>

1524
01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Roy Roy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not Roy.</v>

1525
01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:16.653

<v Speaker 2>set up this match between me and the </v>

1526
01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.080
<v Speaker 2>angel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was doing work for me.</v>

1527
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:22.810
<v Speaker 2>It was a chamfer standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be so late.</v>

1528
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryan Ryan's toy review.</v>

<v Speaker 2>pissed</v>

<v Speaker 2>Danny Devito.</v>

<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1534
01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:48.700
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I could take peewee Herman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a little crazy.</v>

1535
01:22:48.701 --> 01:22:50.350
<v Speaker 2>He's old though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's Wiley.</v>

1536
01:22:51.190 --> 01:22:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Wiley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wiley.</v>

1537
01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not many even feels bad.</v>

1538
01:22:57.341 --> 01:23:01.540
<v Speaker 2>But you actually gave me the clue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I type Roy toys and it said Ryan.</v>

1539
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:05.520
<v Speaker 2>So either you're on top of it tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Who could I anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's focus enough about me.</v>

1541
01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.753
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 10>fun of the Japanese,</v>

1544
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:21.850
<v Speaker 10>the suicide forest,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and,</v>

1545
01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.610
<v Speaker 10>and rushed me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Notice when he,</v>

1546
01:23:23.611 --> 01:23:24.660
<v Speaker 10>then,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when they rushed each other,</v>

1547
01:23:24.661 --> 01:23:28.050
<v Speaker 10>by the way that he never actually throws</v>
<v Speaker 10>a punch.</v>

1548
01:23:28.051 --> 01:23:33.051
<v Speaker 10>They just like collide and then everyone</v>
<v Speaker 10>charges in to do like this iconic,</v>

1549
01:23:34.111 --> 01:23:35.210
<v Speaker 10>like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

1550
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:38.470
<v Speaker 10>they went there.</v>
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

1551
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:40.590
<v Speaker 10>break it up.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Break it up.</v>

1552
01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.113
<v Speaker 10>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There's this one where they rushed the </v>

1553
01:23:42.661 --> 01:23:43.710
<v Speaker 10>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I have to find this.</v>

1554
01:23:43.711 --> 01:23:46.500
<v Speaker 10>Maybe we missed it already.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's here.</v>

1555
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:48.780
<v Speaker 10>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what the fuck is he doing?</v>

1556
01:23:48.781 --> 01:23:50.250
<v Speaker 10>I look at,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this was the Nazi salute.</v>

1557
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:51.960
<v Speaker 10>You see how uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you see.</v>

1558
01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:52.813
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So I charged them but doesn't actually </v>

1559
01:23:53.641 --> 01:23:55.740
<v Speaker 10>throw up.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like,</v>

1560
01:23:55.750 --> 01:24:00.750
<v Speaker 10>what are you intending to do your bit?</v>

1561
01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:05.720
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be bald in two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logan.</v>

1562
01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Imagine Logan Paul Bald and like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lamborghini,</v>

1563
01:24:11.151 --> 01:24:12.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bawled,</v>

1564
01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:17.680
<v Speaker 2>like bawled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not even like bristles a baby.</v>

1565
01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:21.890
<v Speaker 2>I prefer the horseshoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>

1566
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1567
01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:24.473
<v Speaker 2>the old monastery left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine Logan Paul Balding sitting on a </v>

1568
01:24:28.941 --> 01:24:32.150
<v Speaker 2>wagon cooking meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a monk.</v>

1569
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:37.870
<v Speaker 2>That's where it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still have that image in a robe with</v>

1570
01:24:39.321 --> 01:24:40.680
<v Speaker 2>a with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with like,</v>

1571
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlling the horse.</v>

1572
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:44.270
<v Speaker 2>That's Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul.</v>

1573
01:24:44.610 --> 01:24:47.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking monk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1574
01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:48.980
<v Speaker 2>it's just self address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1575
01:24:48.981 --> 01:24:51.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything genuine.</v>

1576
01:24:51.711 --> 01:24:53.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1577
01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:55.100
<v Speaker 2>and then here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

1578
01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.520
<v Speaker 2>They want to bring 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people into an auditorium.</v>

1579
01:24:58.730 --> 01:25:00.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>

1580
01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:04.490
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be guaranteed the least</v>
<v Speaker 2>entertaining boxing match ever.</v>

1581
01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:07.700
<v Speaker 2>These are two youtubers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not trained professional fighters.</v>

1582
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:08.803
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to go the full distance of </v>

1583
01:25:11.811 --> 01:25:12.644
<v Speaker 2>the five because none of them have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity or the physical ability to </v>

1584
01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:16.694
<v Speaker 2>knock each other out.</v>

1585
01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:19.010
<v Speaker 2>They're going to get tired after two </v>
<v Speaker 2>rounds.</v>

1586
01:25:19.190 --> 01:25:20.023
<v Speaker 2>There's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just gonna be a bunch of tired ass </v>

1587
01:25:21.471 --> 01:25:22.304
<v Speaker 2>dudes throwing punches at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to end in a judge decision </v>

1588
01:25:26.031 --> 01:25:26.864
<v Speaker 2>and honestly you could go either way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because who fucking cares at that point </v>

1589
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:33.970
<v Speaker 2>because you paid hundreds of dollars to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch essentially to untrained fighters,</v>

1590
01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:36.123
<v Speaker 2>a throat wet noodles at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically all they're going to </v>

1591
01:25:38.901 --> 01:25:40.720
<v Speaker 2>be throwing after two rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think?</v>

1592
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:43.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is like you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is obviously stage.</v>

1593
01:25:43.791 --> 01:25:44.624
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the fight is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine in any way or is it like </v>

1594
01:25:46.161 --> 01:25:46.994
<v Speaker 2>wrestling and it's pretty good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it'll be real because they both </v>

1595
01:25:49.731 --> 01:25:51.260
<v Speaker 2>want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1596
01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.960
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think either of them can </v>
<v Speaker 2>knock each other out.</v>

1597
01:25:53.961 --> 01:25:54.794
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really genuinely don't know they're </v>

1598
01:25:56.391 --> 01:25:57.224
<v Speaker 2>doing this twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like another fight date in </v>

1599
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:01.123
<v Speaker 2>January.</v>

1600
01:26:01.650 --> 01:26:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first in the UK,</v>

1601
01:26:03.681 --> 01:26:05.690
<v Speaker 2>but then they're doing a us one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should go.</v>

1602
01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear you.</v>

1603
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:11.360
<v Speaker 2>But I also think a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do that.</v>

1604
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:14.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1605
01:26:14.121 --> 01:26:14.954
<v Speaker 2>it would be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been wanting to plan a man on the </v>

1606
01:26:16.281 --> 01:26:17.114
<v Speaker 2>street segment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I've been wanting to do something </v>

1607
01:26:18.921 --> 01:26:23.000
<v Speaker 2>with Joey Salads for some reason where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent him like man on the street,</v>

1608
01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:27.830
<v Speaker 2>so or maybe not even joe sells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe someone we actually respect to</v>

1609
01:26:27.831 --> 01:26:30.290
<v Speaker 2>go create a segment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1610
01:26:30.291 --> 01:26:31.950
<v Speaker 2>and play it on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1611
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Shit Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a great idea.</v>

1612
01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:37.220
<v Speaker 2>And Ian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you down,</v>

1613
01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:40.490
<v Speaker 2>you're down to go to the UK to go watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>a kids eye versus logan?</v>

1614
01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:41.423
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in La.</v>

1615
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:42.440
<v Speaker 2>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1616
01:26:42.441 --> 01:26:44.210
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the first one is in the UK.</v>

1617
01:26:44.410 --> 01:26:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that makes sense.</v>

1618
01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:48.020
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering whether they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it in the UK because l okay.</v>

1619
01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:49.010
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

1620
01:26:49.190 --> 01:26:50.023
<v Speaker 2>August 25th in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second fight is scheduled for February </v>

1621
01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:56.160
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 in an undecided venue in the US.</v>

1622
01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Probably La Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul is basically,</v>

1623
01:26:58.310 --> 01:27:00.680
<v Speaker 2>he's fallen from grace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's selling maverick.</v>

1624
01:27:00.681 --> 01:27:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Merge his vlogs on getting that many </v>
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>

1625
01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Did it about a $7,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

1626
01:27:04.431 --> 01:27:06.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the property tax on $7,000,000</v>

1627
01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:06.944
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're looking at well to one </v>

1628
01:27:10.551 --> 01:27:11.870
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's.</v>

1629
01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Is that $70,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year every year forever.</v>

1630
01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that youtube money we'll keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling in,</v>

1631
01:27:20.341 --> 01:27:21.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1632
01:27:21.751 --> 01:27:22.584
<v Speaker 2>probably but like to an extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean when he bought that house he </v>

1633
01:27:25.321 --> 01:27:27.650
<v Speaker 2>was at his peak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1634
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:28.583
<v Speaker 2>And now we'll look what he's doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's going to get paid </v>

1635
01:27:31.651 --> 01:27:33.000
<v Speaker 2>handsomely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>

1636
01:27:33.010 --> 01:27:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I haven't watched other people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction to this,</v>

1637
01:27:35.401 --> 01:27:40.401
<v Speaker 2>but hopefully they also don't get taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>in with like there's a lot of details of</v>

1638
01:27:42.001 --> 01:27:42.840
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1639
01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:47.841
<v Speaker 2>when a look when Ksi told comedy shorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gamer to chill,</v>

1640
01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:52.140
<v Speaker 2>look at all these details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh look what that means.</v>

1641
01:27:52.141 --> 01:27:55.890
<v Speaker 2>It's all a bunch of fucking bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look in the crowd by the way.</v>

1642
01:27:55.891 --> 01:27:56.724
<v Speaker 2>All these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1643
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:58.380
<v Speaker 2>I've talked enough about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

1644
01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm boring myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was one funny detail.</v>

1645
01:28:04.681 --> 01:28:05.221
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1646
01:28:05.221 --> 01:28:08.610
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're selling out this arena.</v>

1647
01:28:09.210 --> 01:28:13.650
<v Speaker 2>It's the biggest sporting arena and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe apparently I read and I was like,</v>

1648
01:28:13.651 --> 01:28:14.484
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder.</v>

1649
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:15.383
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how they're the ticket sales </v>
<v Speaker 2>are because the fight is coming up </v>

1650
01:28:17.251 --> 01:28:20.640
<v Speaker 2>pretty soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm go to the seating plan</v>

1651
01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.470
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1652
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:28.700
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of fucking seats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I scroll down here?</v>

1653
01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:34.090
<v Speaker 2>So these were never opened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are closed and these are,</v>

1654
01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:40.400
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of seats available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know like these,</v>

1655
01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:42.530
<v Speaker 2>these are quite possibly we're never </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened.</v>

1656
01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:47.750
<v Speaker 2>I just looked it up with 21,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the capacity of that arena.</v>

1657
01:28:47.751 --> 01:28:49.520
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even look like they're at </v>
<v Speaker 2>half of that.</v>

1658
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1659
01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:51.733
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't that far off next month I </v>

1660
01:28:54.891 --> 01:28:55.920
<v Speaker 2>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1661
01:28:55.921 --> 01:28:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

1662
01:28:57.230 --> 01:28:59.180
<v Speaker 2>The ticket sales don't go up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1663
01:28:59.181 --> 01:29:00.014
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm going to be looking at when I </v>

1664
01:29:01.351 --> 01:29:04.440
<v Speaker 2>watched that is I want to see the seats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see.</v>

1665
01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Well what usually what they do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll like,</v>

1666
01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:08.393
<v Speaker 2>they'll try to fill the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pack it all in where the camera's </v>

1667
01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:11.323
<v Speaker 2>consumed for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all these like ring side seem </v>

1668
01:29:13.471 --> 01:29:16.020
<v Speaker 2>filled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is that like 2000 at most?</v>

1669
01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Probably not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a thousand.</v>

1670
01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:23.370
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ringside seats man.</v>

1671
01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:27.940
<v Speaker 2>It was funny but apparently yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it's like $600 for a ringside</v>

1672
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:30.240
<v Speaker 2>seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Worth it.</v>

1673
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not my budget.</v>

1674
01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Let me see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ticket prices and who fucking cares.</v>

1675
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:37.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>

1676
01:29:37.501 --> 01:29:41.250

<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

1677
01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.530
<v Speaker 2>That's what I have to say about that.</v>

1679
01:29:49.921 --> 01:29:53.370

<v Speaker 2>But nobody's clapping for me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>genuine.</v>

1683
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I deserve that.</v>

1684
01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last week we spoke about Metamucil,</v>

1685
01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:22.330
<v Speaker 2>which is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris,</v>

1686
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:24.100
<v Speaker 2>this is what everyone has been waiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

1687
01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>people watching right now.</v>

1689
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's saying for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was waiting for this.</v>

1690
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:33.490
<v Speaker 2>So it was recommended to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1691
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:36.460
<v Speaker 2>and I bought it.</v>

1692
01:30:38.970 --> 01:30:39.803
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of expensive by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like 25 bucks for like 300 </v>

1693
01:30:41.701 --> 01:30:43.740
<v Speaker 2>capsules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you get the bottle it says take</v>

1694
01:30:43.741 --> 01:30:45.540
<v Speaker 2>five a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like these huge pills.</v>

1695
01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1696
01:30:46.911 --> 01:30:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five a day.</v>

1697
01:30:47.851 --> 01:30:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like damn.</v>

1698
01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.250
<v Speaker 2>But then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking five.</v>

1699
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:56.270
<v Speaker 2>They'll not like a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a huge pill of like wheat,</v>

1700
01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:57.571
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1701
01:30:57.571 --> 01:30:58.404
<v Speaker 2>of course it's going to clean my bowels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I just eat a banana at that </v>

1702
01:31:00.451 --> 01:31:03.610
<v Speaker 2>point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1703
01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:06.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather you'd have banana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

1704
01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:07.494
<v Speaker 2>I take two pills and this is a night </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm going out to a party and for </v>

1705
01:31:11.701 --> 01:31:16.701
<v Speaker 2>dinner I have pizza and I have alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 2>now for any mortal man,</v>

1706
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:18.283
<v Speaker 2>any one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this would result an absolute </v>

1707
01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:22.670
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Total.</v>

1708
01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:25.140
<v Speaker 2>A wasteland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1709
01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Of the anus and asshole area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankly.</v>

1710
01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So disgusting.</v>

1711
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:31.970
<v Speaker 2>When I have diarrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sprays on my thighs and I'm not going</v>

1712
01:31:31.971 --> 01:31:36.600
<v Speaker 2>to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it happens sometimes.</v>

1713
01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:41.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean sometimes you blast and it really</v>
<v Speaker 2>hits the side of the road.</v>

1714
01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:43.370
<v Speaker 2>The deflection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ice.</v>

1715
01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I just thought you were like a shotgun </v>
<v Speaker 2>blast and it was just,</v>

1716
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:48.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a buck shot at sometimes you.</v>

1717
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'll be sad when I have a meal</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

1718
01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:55.500
<v Speaker 2>You're wiping as I do this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't fucking hate on me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Ian fessed up.</v>

01:31:58.081 --> 01:32:00.820
<v Speaker 2>He's a front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a at the front.</v>

1721
01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.113
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you guys were arguing about it on </v>

1722
01:32:03.221 --> 01:32:04.054
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ian and I were arguing about it back </v>

<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1724
01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:09.910
<v Speaker 2>I got to say too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was curious that night I went home and</v>

1725
01:32:09.911 --> 01:32:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I tried it your way and I gotta say it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>inferior.</v>

1726
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:16.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are not used to it.</v>

1727
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:19.120
<v Speaker 2>If I tried it your way wouldn't respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have years,</v>

1728
01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:21.580
<v Speaker 2>decades of experience wiping it's muscle</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>

1729
01:32:21.581 --> 01:32:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet will you.</v>

1730
01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:25.390
<v Speaker 2>What do you expect to go home and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>live?</v>

1731
01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Live one evening in my asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think that's,</v>

01:32:36.401 --> 01:32:37.360
<v Speaker 2>fret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And frankly I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm in the middle of something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1736
01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:41.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about my shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diarrhea.</v>

1737
01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.620

<v Speaker 2>I better check my thighs and cheeks just</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be safe.</v>

1740
01:32:56.190 --> 01:32:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's reality for me.</v>

1741
01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:01.950
<v Speaker 2>And this was one of those meals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I take these pills.</v>

1742
01:33:01.951 --> 01:33:02.784
<v Speaker 2>I took two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not five before I go out because when </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be okay.</v>

1752
01:33:41.690 --> 01:33:44.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily have the courage not</v>
<v Speaker 2>to end with a wetland.</v>

1850
01:39:06.391 --> 01:39:09.930
<v Speaker 2>old friend Jimmy Lee is up to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>antics that I find pretty funny.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Appreciate you so very much.</v>

1857
01:39:24.570 --> 01:39:27.550
<v Speaker 2>A Jimmy Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jersey outlaw.</v>

1858
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:31.110
<v Speaker 2>He's still at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's dangerously funny.</v>

1859
01:39:31.111 --> 01:39:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember Jimmy Lee?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

1860
01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:38.100
<v Speaker 2>He's like this incredibly racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>abrasive unfunny.</v>

1861
01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Just really a character and the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>way possible.</v>

1862
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:43.703
<v Speaker 2>We had him as a guest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the worst episodes we had </v>

1863
01:39:46.531 --> 01:39:48.600
<v Speaker 2>as mad as a guest and after our first </v>
<v Speaker 2>break,</v>

1864
01:39:48.601 --> 01:39:50.580
<v Speaker 2>me Dan and Isla were huddled in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>

1865
01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:54.060
<v Speaker 2>He was outside and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did we can't,</v>

1866
01:39:54.090 --> 01:39:55.770
<v Speaker 2>this can't go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to end this.</v>

1867
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:57.970
<v Speaker 2>So we actually gave them the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1868
01:39:58.450 --> 01:40:02.250
<v Speaker 2>the cartoon came off the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's frankly,</v>

1869
01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:03.113
<v Speaker 2>it's our fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we should have anticipated </v>

1870
01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.430
<v Speaker 2>that this would have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a formative experience for us.</v>

1871
01:40:08.431 --> 01:40:09.900
<v Speaker 2>We didn't really know what we were doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

1872
01:40:09.901 --> 01:40:10.734
<v Speaker 2>but it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1873
01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:12.210
<v Speaker 2>it was early days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1874
01:40:12.211 --> 01:40:14.580
<v Speaker 2>he started view body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't actually,</v>

1875
01:40:14.581 --> 01:40:18.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm having an engaged audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this video has one point,</v>

1876
01:40:18.991 --> 01:40:22.220
<v Speaker 2>2 million views,</v>
<v Speaker 2>94 comments and 900 likes.</v>

1877
01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:26.100
<v Speaker 2>So he started view bonding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I find pretty,</v>

1878
01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:29.340
<v Speaker 2>pretty terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once sick of the comments,</v>

1879
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're my father.</v>

1880
01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:33.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't think a youtube video has ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>made me laugh so hard.</v>

1881
01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:35.073
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheers to you about literally couldn't </v>

1882
01:40:39.721 --> 01:40:42.330
<v Speaker 2>finish this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made it halfway and stopped too cringey.</v>

1883
01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:43.291
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So the video starts while you watch for </v>

1887
01:40:55.871 --> 01:40:56.704
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The video starts with five seconds for </v>

1888
01:41:05.471 --> 01:41:08.750
<v Speaker 2>the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Begins with them having crowds of people</v>

1889
01:41:08.751 --> 01:41:13.751
<v Speaker 2>pretending to know who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a phenomenon I've noticed,</v>

<v Speaker 2>spring in his videos.</v>

01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:21.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a part of his plan to view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess is that he's,</v>

1892
01:41:21.670 --> 01:41:24.080
<v Speaker 2>he's building this great story about </v>

<v Speaker 2>Goldmine and now the eel is gone.</v>

1957
