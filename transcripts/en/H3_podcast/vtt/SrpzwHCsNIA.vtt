<v Speaker 3>be excited to maybe two,</v>

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 3>maybe two.</v>

<v Speaker 3>law.</v>

29
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 3>I was following you and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like obsessed with you,</v>

30
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 3>and then I kept tweeting your videos and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you were like,</v>

31
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.603
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>

33
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'd never done that to anyone.</v>

37
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 3>And it's such an uncomfortable place to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to to go like,</v>

38
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.360
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>tell me if you enjoy it.</v>

40
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

41
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 3>that was a big fucking mistake.</v>

42
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 3>The good stuff first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>

43
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you came back,</v>

44
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 3>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was hilarious.</v>

45
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 3>Hey Randy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving out to la,</v>

46
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 3>come do my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

47
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

48
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 3>you're coming up to La Mama podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her left eye.</v>

49
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 3>Then the sad part is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we had you on,</v>

50
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 3>we had this one are probably the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>episodes,</v>

51
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 3>probably the first guy here in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>office.</v>

52
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 3>We had just got this studio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had just built this big beautiful set</v>

53
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 3>or like let's bring Burton.</v>

54
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 3>He's always honored guests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was such a great,</v>

55
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 3>I was flipping the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember you flipped the table.</v>

56
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.763
<v Speaker 3>We were drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were drunk when I left here and you </v>

57
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 3>said to me when you started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

58
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:19.851
<v Speaker 3>I don't really drink by the first break,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in 30 minutes we were drunk.</v>

59
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I was flipping the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was the best episode I've ever</v>

60
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.164
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can say that without reserve because </v>

61
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 3>no one will ever see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one will ever,</v>

62
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.213
<v Speaker 3>and it's such a shame because it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>lost to oblivion for technical issues </v>

63
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we were new.</v>

64
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know we were doing and I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sorry that that happened.</v>

65
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.413
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I will say we learned a lot of </v>

66
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:41.904
<v Speaker 3>things from that episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We learned a lot from meeting gayle and </v>

67
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 3>having you on and I want to list some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things we learned from it if I can.</v>

68
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

69
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:50.664
<v Speaker 3>to your great credit we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like three hours of shooting and </v>

70
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:55.920
<v Speaker 3>you said you have to post the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing on edited.</v>

71
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.610
<v Speaker 3>That was like November.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were like,</v>

72
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 3>and you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were cutting.</v>

73
00:02:59.291 --> 00:02:59.970
<v Speaker 3>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

74
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 3>cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>

75
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:01.451
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

76
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just rolled his whole thing.</v>

77
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe we have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were thinking,</v>

78
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 3>because we were still thinking like </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube video.</v>

79
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 3>You were definitely thinking youtube </v>
<v Speaker 3>video and thinking like you're like,</v>

80
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 3>we got to chop it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

81
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:12.731
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

82
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:13.050
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

83
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I kept saying the beautiful stuff is</v>

84
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 3>the in between stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I love,</v>

85
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.473
<v Speaker 3>my favorite part of podcasting is when </v>
<v Speaker 3>like something happens off mic and </v>

86
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:24.500
<v Speaker 3>you're listening and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

87
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 3>what's going on over there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Favorite part.</v>

88
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 3>We were so obsessed with cutting it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>editing it down.</v>

89
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 3>It's true that it loses authenticity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It loses the pop.</v>

90
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.293
<v Speaker 3>And when you're in the editing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to edit down like a </v>

91
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.880
<v Speaker 3>natural conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like mad at me.</v>

92
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

93
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were right.</v>

94
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.413
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

95
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.573
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

96
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 3>And we always thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it took us a while to get there,</v>

97
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 3>but we stopped editing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We said Bert was right.</v>

98
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

99
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 3>number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember we don't get,</v>

100
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.770
<v Speaker 3>we get uber blocks for all of our guests</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

101
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we forgot about that.</v>

102
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

103
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:20.041
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did at the time I didn't even,</v>

104
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:20.974
<v Speaker 3>I understood there was uber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know anyone used anything </v>

105
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 3>other than uber black and your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

106
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 3>I want to be drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get an uber.</v>

107
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:26.951
<v Speaker 3>And you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

108
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:27.401
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

109
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:28.234
<v Speaker 3>I insist</v>

110
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.790
<v Speaker 4>wasn't a carb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it may have been.</v>

111
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 3>I totally forgot that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let us get you an uber home.</v>

112
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:57.921
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

113
00:04:57.921 --> 00:04:58.754
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that there was another </v>

114
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 3>option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was on the other end,</v>

115
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 3>but I remember we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was trying to pick you up,</v>

116
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't find deals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're on the phone.</v>

117
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 3>He didn't speak English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's on the corner.</v>

118
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:12.820
<v Speaker 3>He's a big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a beard.</v>

119
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't get in his back seat.</v>

294
00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.710
<v Speaker 6>I've already stopped watching it for the</v>
<v Speaker 6>record.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Come on money anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

297
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.650

<v Speaker 6>instruct them to break the wall.</v>

298
00:13:15.651 --> 00:13:16.790
<v Speaker 6>So it looks like they're actually done.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it should be noted.</v>

301
00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:26.080
<v Speaker 5>She didn't even take a breath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now let's see.</v>

302
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like can I tell you what's crazy is that</v>

303
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 5>this got me into a spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The quicksand and there's a video online</v>

304
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.383
<v Speaker 5>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

305
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.313
<v Speaker 5>I think he's like a brittle British </v>
<v Speaker 5>journalist where quicksand is out in </v>

306
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:40.690
<v Speaker 5>like the aisles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like somewhere close.</v>

307
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

308
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.190
<v Speaker 5>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the quick son,</v>

309
00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:46.024
<v Speaker 5>he is pretty dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what I'm going to do is I'm going </v>

310
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:47.794
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to demonstrate how you get in </v>

311
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:50.350
<v Speaker 5>and out of quick sand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got all of the safety guards,</v>

312
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.330
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So first of all,</v>

313
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 5>you get in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wiggle around a little bit,</v>

314
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.330
<v Speaker 5>all right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you go in a little lower.</v>

315
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.223
<v Speaker 5>While this was happening quick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does that mean a lot quicker than I </v>

316
00:13:57.221 --> 00:13:58.054
<v Speaker 5>thought?</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

317
00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.403
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe we want to start getting me out </v>

318
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.240
<v Speaker 5>and they spend three hours trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>them out of quick.</v>

319
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.890
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he is terrified.</v>

320
00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:09.490
<v Speaker 5>And he was thinking and how high up does</v>
<v Speaker 5>it go?</v>

321
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.280
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I honestly think it gets to his chest,</v>

322
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.790
<v Speaker 5>but he can't breathe and he's like </v>

<v Speaker 5>is a sociopath.</v>

389
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.870
<v Speaker 5>Tony Robbins freaks me out because on </v>
<v Speaker 5>one hand like he,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He's a,</v>

394
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.263
<v Speaker 5>he could make you eat poison apple sauce</v>
<v Speaker 5>and catch a fucking comment behind the </v>

395
00:17:16.751 --> 00:17:17.584
<v Speaker 5>moon or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could do that 100% he's got to be </v>

396
00:17:21.121 --> 00:17:21.954
<v Speaker 5>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a video of him showing off his </v>

397
00:17:23.351 --> 00:17:24.184
<v Speaker 5>house in Fiji.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right and he's showing it to the camera </v>

398
00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.573
<v Speaker 5>and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you ever like the best way to say </v>

399
00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:32.344
<v Speaker 5>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you ever have a friend who gets </v>

400
00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:36.880
<v Speaker 5>genital warts?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then every conversation they have,</v>

401
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.760
<v Speaker 5>all they do is kind of slide in </v>
<v Speaker 5>statistics about how common general</v>

402
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.270
<v Speaker 4>told you the day of genital warts are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like you don't want to force people</v>

403

<v Speaker 4>have HPV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>HPV is very common.</v>

404
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.223
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very common.</v>

405
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.083
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait.</v>

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:50.490
<v Speaker 4>He is an interesting,</v>

407
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Speaker 3>I go to the very end and watch the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>he makes going on.</v>

408
00:17:54.721 --> 00:17:57.990
<v Speaker 3>I can't see it for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not ready.</v>

409
00:17:57.991 --> 00:18:00.700
<v Speaker 3>But you was covering the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me try to address that.</v>

410
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.553
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

411
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.350
<v Speaker 3>He's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

412
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.100
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can remember.</v>

413
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.973
<v Speaker 3>He's basically saying it's got heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very integral part of this </v>

414
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:08.370
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really his family.</v>

415
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:09.204
<v Speaker 3>They call him big boss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is what a family who calls him </v>

416
00:18:14.311 --> 00:18:16.770
<v Speaker 3>big boss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone calls him big pause.</v>

417
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Everyone that children called him big </v>
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

418
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucked up.</v>

419
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.260
<v Speaker 3>But the best part is he forces everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop what they're doing.</v>

420
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.333
<v Speaker 3>Come out to the driveway and sing a song</v>
<v Speaker 3>to him and he stands in the middle as </v>

421
00:18:30.031 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 3>they sing at him and play the guitar and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at some guys like,</v>

422
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 3>I've got to get back to cutting trees.</v>

423
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.151
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tony,</v>

424
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:36.984
<v Speaker 3>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just play a little bit and you'll </v>

425
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:41.430
<v Speaker 3>see them sitting into apples though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in great shape.</v>

426
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.833
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm answering all this and I understand </v>

427
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:47.190
<v Speaker 3>that he's never sold himself as anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than what he is.</v>

428
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

429
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:53.210
<v Speaker 3>being hypocritical is out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We watched the documentary lugs.</v>

430
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.283
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is like there's a documentary </v>

431
00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:59.730
<v Speaker 3>on Netflix about him that was a definite</v>
<v Speaker 3>puff piece,</v>

432
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 3>but you can't help but aside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>insanity of it.</v>

433
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.550
<v Speaker 3>So as hard as they try to make him look </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a saint,</v>

434
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.590
<v Speaker 3>you can tell how weird it is also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

00:36:03.251 --> 00:36:07.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like these retreats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cost like $10,000</v>

762
00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.420
<v Speaker 2>and people are like getting loans and </v>

<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

767
00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:22.360
<v Speaker 2>what he would say is it's important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make that sacrifice so the experience is</v>

768
00:36:22.671 --> 00:36:23.504
<v Speaker 2>more worth it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy for him to say when he's </v>

769
00:36:26.031 --> 00:36:27.530
<v Speaker 2>getting $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>hairs,</v>

770
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.180
<v Speaker 2>he would say the same thing but not </v>
<v Speaker 2>important for you to maybe fire maybe 15</v>

771
00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.110
<v Speaker 2>could we more look that up man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>10,000</v>

773
00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's his business mastery.</v>

774
00:36:39.861 --> 00:36:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe he has different ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the ultimate retreat.</v>

775
00:36:44.331 --> 00:36:46.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like a week long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They even give you lunch.</v>

776
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.210
<v Speaker 2>They even give you lunches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they give you a loan</v>

777
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.470
<v Speaker 5>lunches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I better not.</v>

778
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:53.263
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

779
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.110
<v Speaker 2>but Tony would say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

780
00:36:56.111 --> 00:36:58.150
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's you're not paying me,</v>

781
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 5>I need this shitty line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really not going to be worth my time.</v>

782
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:01.853
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to flip on you and I'm </v>

783
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:05.070
<v Speaker 5>starting to side with Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked it as $10,000</v>

784
00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:06.450
<v Speaker 5>make it hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Earn it.</v>

785
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.670
<v Speaker 5>That's what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

786
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.290
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

787
00:37:10.291 --> 00:37:10.630
<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>

788
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.750
<v Speaker 2>And that's such a nice thing to say when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the one receiving the money.</v>

789
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:17.060
<v Speaker 5>My wife the other day said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't give you blowjobs anymore.</v>

790
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.920
<v Speaker 5>Your Dick's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

791
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:20.090
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't argue with that.</v>

792
00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.613
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the same logic that Tony's giving </v>

793
00:37:23.481 --> 00:37:24.314
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should always pay more so that it </v>

794
00:37:26.571 --> 00:37:28.250
<v Speaker 5>would work more and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

795
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:29.143
<v Speaker 5>it does make sense.</v>

796
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Losing the logical connection as he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

797
00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.860
<v Speaker 2>she's saying that Tony doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

798
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.480
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying and so</v>

799
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.630
<v Speaker 5>brilliant marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am charging so much that it works.</v>

800
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.340
<v Speaker 5>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I charged it,</v>

801
00:37:42.341 --> 00:37:44.470
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if your wife says,</v>

802
00:37:44.471 --> 00:37:47.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to suck your Dick Anymore </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's too big,</v>

803
00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.160

<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

804
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.650

<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

832
00:38:40.311 --> 00:38:43.120
<v Speaker 5>we don't have too long to find the </v>
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>

833
00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:45.040
<v Speaker 5>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me paraphrase.</v>

834
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:46.660
<v Speaker 5>And 11 you had said,</v>

835
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I remember what he said in one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant auditoriums.</v>

836
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:52.930
<v Speaker 2>He said they were talking about me too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

837
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:54.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone too far.</v>

838
00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:55.923
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think me too was too much about the </v>

839
00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:00.004
<v Speaker 2>victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't want yourself to be the </v>

840
00:39:01.781 --> 00:39:02.614
<v Speaker 2>victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to keep control of your own </v>

841
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:05.800
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of these people being like,</v>

842

<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

843
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:07.294
<v Speaker 2>It's like you need to take control for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own healing and your own life and </v>

844
00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:12.490
<v Speaker 2>stop being the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

845
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.540
<v Speaker 2>I get where he's coming from.</v>

846
00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.990
<v Speaker 5>I could see why people would defend it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

847
00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.200
<v Speaker 2>He offended people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

848
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.180
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone too far.</v>

849
00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.570
<v Speaker 2>I work with ceos who just told me this </v>
<v Speaker 2>anecdote.</v>

850
00:39:23.571 --> 00:39:24.404

<v Speaker 2>I had two people applied to be my </v>

851
00:39:25.611 --> 00:39:26.444

852
00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:29.443
<v Speaker 2>more qualified and the other was a dude </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was less qualified than another </v>

853
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:35.030
<v Speaker 2>beautiful woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I hired the dude because I don't,</v>

854
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:36.790

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

00:42:18.591 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 3>we'll get like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

931
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.173
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like when an Artie Lange after he </v>

932
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 3>stabbed himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

933
00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:25.130
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

934
00:42:25.131 --> 00:42:26.660
<v Speaker 3>first time he got back on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a joke.</v>

935
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:27.494
<v Speaker 3>He said No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how was everyone's fashion week if </v>

936
00:42:35.901 --> 00:42:36.734
<v Speaker 3>you give him that was time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to come back with something </v>

937
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.950
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

938
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.843
<v Speaker 3>And I bet and we'll hear it in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>community cause we'll see him work out </v>

939
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Speaker 3>bits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

940
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.970
<v Speaker 3>But when he does that special that he'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay for himself will release himself.</v>

941
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Not everyone will buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fine.</v>

942
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:52.010
<v Speaker 3>I'll definitely buy it and I'll sit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch them fuck out of it.</v>

943
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.050
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely will.</v>

944
00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:54.943
<v Speaker 3>He was the one guy was that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately like I definitely did all </v>

945
00:42:58.401 --> 00:43:02.030
<v Speaker 3>the things owned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like Whoa.</v>

946
00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:02.893
<v Speaker 3>Pretty aggressively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a Wa that's almost quicksand </v>

947
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.730
<v Speaker 3>level of fetish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

948
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:11.870
<v Speaker 3>My Room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden,</v>

949
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:12.920
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to come in my room?</v>

950
00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>

951
00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Do you mind if I jerk off and sat in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of the door?</v>

952
00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

953
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

954
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:25.790
<v Speaker 3>this is a really slippery slope to even </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring this up to even suggest this.</v>

955
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:31.030
<v Speaker 3>But like say that is what you're sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say That is your fetish.</v>

956
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like say that that is the one thing</v>

957
00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:36.380
<v Speaker 3>that turns you on is masturbating in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of and they can't escape.</v>

958
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:36.771
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

959
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:36.980
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

960
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:37.221
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

961
00:43:37.221 --> 00:43:38.570
<v Speaker 3>Just say masturbating in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

962
00:43:38.571 --> 00:43:39.404
<v Speaker 3>Let's simplify it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just say masturbate in front of </v>

963
00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:41.870
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that turns you want,</v>

964
00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:42.704
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

965
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:47.690
<v Speaker 3>How do you go about your credit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hire a prostitute,</v>

966
00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:48.071
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

967
00:43:48.071 --> 00:43:48.431
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

968
00:43:48.431 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

969
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.083
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever say something to someone and </v>

970
00:43:51.981 --> 00:43:53.090
<v Speaker 3>then you don't realize what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying?</v>

971
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Like I said to someone the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

972
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.753
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>

973
00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:56.530
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's I guess,</v>

974
00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.160
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>

975
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even begin to finish answering </v>
<v Speaker 3>that question.</v>

976
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:02.503
<v Speaker 3>You got me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got me.</v>

977
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.580
<v Speaker 3>I said to my wife and son were friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

978
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:06.500
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

979
00:44:06.501 --> 00:44:07.334
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem is I was talking </v>

980
00:44:08.301 --> 00:44:09.730
<v Speaker 3>about Kitty Porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about Kiddie porn,</v>

981
00:44:09.731 --> 00:44:10.491
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

982
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:14.840
<v Speaker 3>but what about this is that these guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be pedophiles at least,</v>

983
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:17.540
<v Speaker 3>or just watching Kiddie porn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then my wife goes,</v>

984
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 3>what about the children in the second </v>
<v Speaker 3>video?</v>

985
00:44:19.581 --> 00:44:20.121
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

986
00:44:20.121 --> 00:44:20.954
<v Speaker 3>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good point.</v>

987
00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.090
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think it through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

988
00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

989
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.361
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

990
00:44:26.361 --> 00:44:26.721
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

991
00:44:26.721 --> 00:44:27.554
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

992
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you say,</v>

993
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

994
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.300
<v Speaker 3>but you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

995
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:38.000
<v Speaker 3>you can find a consenting person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

996
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I guess that was his move is that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be like,</v>

997
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 3>do you mind if I masturbate in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>

998
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:42.234
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also the places he did it was </v>

999
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:44.124
<v Speaker 3>that they do it at a bar and no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>calls foul are you find a random girl </v>

1000
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 3>and you go on a couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he doesn't like the dates,</v>

1001
00:44:50.191 --> 00:44:51.030
<v Speaker 3>it's just the random,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1002
00:44:51.031 --> 00:44:52.050
<v Speaker 3>how you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bob's your uncle,</v>

1003
00:44:52.051 --> 00:44:53.040
<v Speaker 3>God bless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see you later.</v>

1004
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:54.383
<v Speaker 3>But I think the problem was that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were familiar and were working where it </v>

1005
00:44:59.521 --> 00:45:00.440
<v Speaker 3>was a power structure.</v>

1006
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:03.631
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1007
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:04.950
<v Speaker 3>do you mind if I jerk off in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

1008
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:06.280
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

1009
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.400
<v Speaker 3>And I remember saying to my wife when </v>
<v Speaker 3>that went down,</v>

1010
00:45:08.401 --> 00:45:09.300
<v Speaker 3>and by this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1011
00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:10.134
<v Speaker 3>this is just honesty and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the roof about me sharing </v>

1012
00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:14.250
<v Speaker 3>honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I apologize.</v>

1013
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.720
<v Speaker 3>But this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just talking.</v>

1014
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.280
<v Speaker 3>I said to my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1015
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.530
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why didn't they just say no?</v>

1016
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why didn't they just walk away?</v>

1017
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:22.620
<v Speaker 3>And my wife goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1018
00:45:22.621 --> 00:45:26.370
<v Speaker 3>let me role play it for you brock Lesnar</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you are in a hotel room.</v>

1019
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.001
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.411
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good call.</v>

1023
00:45:31.411 --> 00:45:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so startling.</v>

1024
00:45:33.571 --> 00:45:34.920
<v Speaker 3>Have a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.820
<v Speaker 2>And I bet you're probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1026
00:45:37.821 --> 00:45:39.380
<v Speaker 2>is this going to be a joke?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this going?</v>

1027
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1028
00:45:40.551 --> 00:45:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1029
00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.313
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden he drops trial </v>

1030
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.380
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1031
00:45:45.381 --> 00:45:47.450
<v Speaker 3>what do I do now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's already started and you're</v>

1032
00:45:47.451 --> 00:45:48.410
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1033
00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.820
<v Speaker 3>we're already can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1034
00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:50.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1035
00:45:50.421 --> 00:45:54.230
<v Speaker 3>it's just a weird situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1036
00:45:54.231 --> 00:45:57.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan of Louise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love my favorite.</v>

1037
00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.073
<v Speaker 2>Surely find my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found myself thinking about him like </v>

1038
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:03.880
<v Speaker 2>if you remember like a week ago and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>told you I hope,</v>

1039
00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I hope he has some good friends around </v>
<v Speaker 2>me that will keep him like,</v>

1040
00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

1041
00:46:09.191 --> 00:46:10.024

<v Speaker 2>he's probably going through like the </v>

1042
00:46:11.531 --> 00:46:13.840
<v Speaker 2>worst time possible</v>

1043
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.010
<v Speaker 3>they took away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>

1044
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.863
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has daughters like it's got to be so </v>

1045
00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.630
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking about my wife jacking</v>

1067
00:47:15.711 --> 00:47:18.770
<v Speaker 3>but since we're talking about secret </v>
<v Speaker 3>time now on Netflix,</v>

1068
00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:20.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bert Kreischer,</v>

1069
00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had spoken,</v>

1070
00:47:23.901 --> 00:47:26.000
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw you do a gesture and,</v>

1071
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:29.860
<v Speaker 3>and the special where you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the Alabama wet wipe.</v>

1072
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1073
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:32.860
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the joke was great,</v>

1074
00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:35.190
<v Speaker 3>but what peaked my interest was this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1075
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:36.213
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1078
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:44.740
<v Speaker 3>it's so natural because I white from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>front.</v>

1079
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:46.240
<v Speaker 3>I went from the front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went from the front.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1082
00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Because the thing that kids do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go home and you go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurry.</v>

1084
00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:07.120
<v Speaker 3>Discriminated against for front wiping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been ostracized.</v>

1085
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.730
<v Speaker 3>I ain't feel like I'm at the forefront </v>
<v Speaker 3>of an important,</v>

1086
00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.380
<v Speaker 3>I love us will notice that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He just wiped from the front.</v>

1088
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:18.543
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1089
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:19.381
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

1090
00:48:19.381 --> 00:48:20.214
<v Speaker 3>and I feel if I'm being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to flower this up and </v>

1091
00:48:22.551 --> 00:48:25.960
<v Speaker 3>we make a hyperbolic statements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like Rosa Parks of the wiping</v>

1092
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:27.430
<v Speaker 3>movement for men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

1093
00:48:27.431 --> 00:48:29.880
<v Speaker 3>I tell you the word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always thought I'm a foreigner.</v>

1094
00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I always felt like a four runner of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wiping.</v>

1095
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you lift the balls,</v>

1096
00:48:33.611 --> 00:48:36.790
<v Speaker 3>when you wipe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lift and pull to the side.</v>

1097
00:48:36.791 --> 00:48:38.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting that old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1098
00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:41.510
<v Speaker 3>I and I rap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can wrap them around the hand.</v>

1099
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.760
<v Speaker 3>I go in and add it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

1100
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Like you're lighting a match,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1101
00:48:45.341 --> 00:48:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Like I go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you should all of your balls.</v>

1103
00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.610
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's not that much space back there </v>

<v Speaker 3>The ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ladies are supposed to pull it back </v>

<v Speaker 3>ever said?</v>

1121
00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:57.850
<v Speaker 3>This conversation was sprung out of one </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1122
00:49:57.851 --> 00:50:00.040
<v Speaker 3>I was in college with all my friends and</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1123
00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.190
<v Speaker 3>and one of my friends was telling a </v>
<v Speaker 3>story about how he had a friend with one</v>

1124
00:50:03.191 --> 00:50:04.720
<v Speaker 3>arm and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1125
00:50:04.721 --> 00:50:05.554
<v Speaker 3>how does he lift his balls up anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was with like four other friends </v>

1126
00:50:09.011 --> 00:50:14.011
<v Speaker 3>and they all went and they all were back</v>
<v Speaker 3>wiping psychopath and they all said what</v>

1127
00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:15.820
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

1128
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:21.710
<v Speaker 3>And I wouldn't pay no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1129
00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:28.700
<v Speaker 3>Two gig salary to be in a time machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that room with you guys.</v>

1130
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.713
<v Speaker 3>And the look on your face wipes is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody was making fun of me because </v>

1131
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.050
<v Speaker 3>they were all back wipers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing that was crazy about it is</v>

1132
00:50:42.051 --> 00:50:42.884
<v Speaker 3>that we didn't know each other existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are two types of people in this </v>

1133
00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:47.410
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1134
00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:48.243
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they don't know they existed until </v>

1135
00:50:49.731 --> 00:50:54.731
<v Speaker 3>I'm again the nes Nelson Mandela of ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>white dude.</v>

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:57.260
<v Speaker 3>And I've opened this dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1137
00:50:57.261 --> 00:51:01.280
<v Speaker 3>I hope that we'll find people like us </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we can share our own secrets.</v>

1138
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:02.203

<v Speaker 3>wanted to get to the heart of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>40% from the front.</v>

1142
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:13.610
<v Speaker 3>So we're not that rare species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's almost a perfect split.</v>

1296
00:58:01.031 --> 00:58:03.280
<v Speaker 3>am uncomfortable watching this being </v>
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is the one that I was watching.</v>

1308
00:58:41.801 --> 00:58:42.634
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm cheating on Isla right </v>

1309
00:58:43.331 --> 00:58:45.880
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I get nervous from this sound.</v>

1312
00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:00.010
<v Speaker 3>That's the opposite to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut up and put that hand to job away.</v>

1313
00:59:00.011 --> 00:59:00.844
<v Speaker 3>Can I get some of this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which you remember when we were kids </v>

1314
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:04.503
<v Speaker 3>when I was kid and you do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go and then you go behind someone </v>

1315
00:59:07.451 --> 00:59:10.320
<v Speaker 3>and it sounded like a b.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

<v Speaker 3>You quit.</v>

1317
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:15.670
<v Speaker 3>You can't do it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it to someone else.</v>

1318
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:17.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1319
00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.253
<v Speaker 3>It's not happening in the early day Smr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But watch this and tell me how </v>

<v Speaker 8>Start you off with Jagger zero.</v>

1325
00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:44.180
<v Speaker 8>She's going to put lotion on her hands.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I need to do a poll a bit.</v>

1326
00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:48.910
<v Speaker 8>When people like me who like this makes </v>
<v Speaker 8>me the opposite of relax.</v>

1327
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:52.830
<v Speaker 8>It's making it be relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'll lead off really.</v>

1328
00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:54.450
<v Speaker 3>I actually might listen to this in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

1329
00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:58.260
<v Speaker 3>I find it relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it very relaxing,</v>

1330
00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.750

1331
01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.153
<v Speaker 8>like</v>

1332
01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:05.030
<v Speaker 3>if I put this on at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like</v>

1333
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:06.783
<v Speaker 8>a creep</v>

1334
01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:08.171
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1335
01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.010
<v Speaker 3>not a creep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna.</v>

1336
01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to label everyone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoys his videos,</v>

1337
01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.570
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I'm in an intro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm cheating on you.</v>

1338
01:00:13.571 --> 01:00:15.010
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1339
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:15.740
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

1340
01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:16.100
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1341
01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.040
<v Speaker 3>This whole role play thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

1342
01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:21.510
<v Speaker 8>I mean man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

1343
01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:26.700
<v Speaker 8>this shit that is topic.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why does this,</v>

1344
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.930
<v Speaker 3>this is lotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope she puts it on her lips.</v>

1345
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Her Lips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who lived looks really fucking dry.</v>

1346
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.213
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end she ends up putting up her </v>

1347
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:48.290
<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy twist,</v>

1348
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:49.940
<v Speaker 3>but it's very pornographic or what's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>end?</v>

1349
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.433
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1350
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.150

<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>

1351
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I just think that it's really a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>lonely guys out right</v>

<v Speaker 8>there.</v>

1353
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:03.770
<v Speaker 3>This is akin to like one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>futuristic movies.</v>

1354
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:05.920
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She's got whatever fucking nearby man.</v>

1356
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:13.560
<v Speaker 3>This is just the idea that she knows </v>
<v Speaker 3>this would play well.</v>

1357
01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>your scalp,</v>

<v Speaker 10>of uh,</v>

1623
01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:34.440
<v Speaker 3>apparently relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some is already giving me anxiety,</v>

1624
01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:36.040
<v Speaker 3>buck land that,</v>

1625
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.080
<v Speaker 6>so that's like a whole horror genre,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

<v Speaker 6>creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Matt.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And he's got potions all on a top hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to think how to describe </v>

1631
01:14:04.551 --> 01:14:09.440
<v Speaker 3>those potions with white gloves on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a bow tie looks like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's ones,</v>

<v Speaker 2>which is a band like Alex Jones.</v>

<v Speaker 2>hate whispering.</v>

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were really hitting it off.</v>

1688
01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:56.770
<v Speaker 2>All it took was one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

1689
01:16:56.771 --> 01:17:00.130
<v Speaker 2>it's pulling her ponytail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pulled my wife's ponytail.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Here's the kicker.</v>

1692
01:17:03.671 --> 01:17:05.910
<v Speaker 2>You Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her Dad pulls her ponytail,</v>

1693
01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:08.530
<v Speaker 2>all the tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't say a fucking word.</v>

1694
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:10.090
<v Speaker 2>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

1695
01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:10.920
<v Speaker 5>can analyze that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1696
01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.060
<v Speaker 5>while we were in Alabama and her dad </v>
<v Speaker 5>came up and said,</v>

1697
01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:16.610
<v Speaker 5>what's up frog and pull the ponytail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she went,</v>

1698
01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:18.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh Daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

1699
01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:20.630
<v Speaker 5>and then I went up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went up like a minute later,</v>

1700
01:17:20.631 --> 01:17:22.500
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's up frog and porter buddy,</v>

1701
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:24.560
<v Speaker 5>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't ever fucking do that again.</v>

1702
01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:26.600
<v Speaker 5>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just did the same thing.</v>

1703
01:17:26.601 --> 01:17:27.530
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very different.</v>

1704
01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:28.380
<v Speaker 5>Very different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I went,</v>

1705
01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:30.530
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1706
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.900
<v Speaker 5>You do not pull my wife's ponytail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you got,</v>

1707
01:17:32.901 --> 01:17:34.170
<v Speaker 5>have you tried to undo?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1708
01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:37.220
<v Speaker 5>have you tried to understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1709
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:39.910
<v Speaker 5>I think that she wasn't allowed to have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1710
01:17:39.911 --> 01:17:40.160
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

1711
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:40.993
<v Speaker 5>her dad is not watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think she was allowed to have a </v>

1712
01:17:42.201 --> 01:17:43.034
<v Speaker 5>voice with her dad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that because she was afraid </v>

1713
01:17:45.891 --> 01:17:47.930
<v Speaker 5>he'd leave because her mom bailed on </v>
<v Speaker 5>her.</v>

1714
01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.513
<v Speaker 5>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't,</v>

1715
01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:53.480
<v Speaker 5>she was right and she didn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she couldn't vocalize that.</v>

1716
01:17:53.481 --> 01:17:55.970
<v Speaker 5>And then when she feels safe with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she vocalizes it.</v>

1717
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:57.320
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's a compliment?</v>

<v Speaker 5>her ponytail and see if she vocalizes it</v>

1720

<v Speaker 5>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I'll just do it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>But like you also on one hand did a </v>

1737
01:18:54.231 --> 01:18:56.720
<v Speaker 5>triathlon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So can you be at both things?</v>

1738
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:58.550
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1739
01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:03.440
<v Speaker 5>I think I am the most in shape out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>shape guy in the world.</v>

1740
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:05.480
<v Speaker 5>Like I ran,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it started with,</v>

1741
01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:06.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it started with,</v>

1742
01:19:06.861 --> 01:19:09.050
<v Speaker 5>I ran the La Marathon with no training </v>
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>

1743
01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.820
<v Speaker 5>How many miles was that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>26.2</v>

1744
01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:14.370
<v Speaker 5>what will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how did you place uh,</v>

1745
01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:16.440
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean good rent,</v>

1746
01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.020
<v Speaker 5>five hours and 33 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1747
01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:20.870
<v Speaker 5>but not like great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but average is that about average?</v>

1748
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.943
<v Speaker 5>I think average is like probably for </v>
<v Speaker 5>four hours and 30 minutes or say you </v>

1749
01:19:25.311 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 5>were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were almost untrained dog training.</v>

1750
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:30.800
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can barely run around the block,</v>

1751
01:19:30.801 --> 01:19:31.280
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

1752
01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.091
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1753
01:19:32.091 --> 01:19:36.200
<v Speaker 5>what happened was run around the block.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We did that sober October challenge me,</v>

1754
01:19:36.201 --> 01:19:37.034
<v Speaker 5>Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tom and Ari and we finished it and we </v>

1755
01:19:40.581 --> 01:19:41.271
<v Speaker 5>were all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1756
01:19:41.271 --> 01:19:42.104
<v Speaker 5>I felt brave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a little bravado cause I'd just </v>

1757
01:19:44.181 --> 01:19:46.640
<v Speaker 5>not drank or done drugs for a month and </v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm like,</v>

1758
01:19:46.641 --> 01:19:47.474
<v Speaker 5>I can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when we all get drunk on Joe's </v>

1759
01:19:49.671 --> 01:19:52.520
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I said very confidently,</v>

1760
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:56.300
<v Speaker 5>I could definitely run a marathon with </v>
<v Speaker 5>no training and everyone,</v>

1761
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:57.920
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in all fairness,</v>

1762
01:19:57.921 --> 01:20:00.050
<v Speaker 5>Joe was the voice of reason and he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1763
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.150
<v Speaker 5>I think you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it would hurt,</v>

1764
01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:03.950
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think you could do it under </v>
<v Speaker 5>five hours.</v>

1765
01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.330
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can do it on a five hours.</v>

1766
01:20:05.331 --> 01:20:06.920
<v Speaker 5>And Ari was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh you couldn't.</v>

1767
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.943
<v Speaker 5>My Dad doerries dad is a holocaust </v>
<v Speaker 5>survivor and 80 years old and he had </v>

1768
01:20:11.761 --> 01:20:13.020
<v Speaker 5>done it in like six hours.</v>

1769
01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.600
<v Speaker 5>Well I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can definitely beat your dad.</v>

1770
01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:15.434
<v Speaker 5>He's 80 Ari.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But how did you know that you could do </v>

1771
01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:18.540
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because like I said,</v>

1772
01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:21.420
<v Speaker 5>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I cannot run around the block.</v>

1773
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:24.450
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do you run like how can I run </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

1774
01:20:24.451 --> 01:20:27.300
<v Speaker 5>like a regular person would?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not like a long list.</v>

1775
01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:28.453
<v Speaker 5>Go for runs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried to do it often but like three </v>

1776
01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:32.820
<v Speaker 5>miles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lower east side.</v>

1777
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:33.833
<v Speaker 5>Well how are you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're running through miles </v>

1778
01:20:35.011 --> 01:20:35.844
<v Speaker 5>regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are you still so in shape I drink a </v>

1779
01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:42.390
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I drink a lot is what the number</v>

1780
01:20:42.391 --> 01:20:46.140
<v Speaker 5>one thing and so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but so then I said I could do it.</v>

1781
01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:49.590
<v Speaker 5>So I signed up the La Marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no training other than regular,</v>

1782
01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:51.240
<v Speaker 5>just like I didn't do it parents on </v>
<v Speaker 5>plan.</v>

1783
01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.313
<v Speaker 5>I just basically jogged whenever I felt </v>
<v Speaker 5>like jogging and I didn't jog when I </v>

1784
01:20:54.691 --> 01:20:56.070
<v Speaker 5>didn't want to jog or drank the night </v>
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>

1785
01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:59.030
<v Speaker 5>showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no training and I was bragging about it.</v>

1786
01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.380
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in line on instagram stories is going to</v>

1787
01:21:01.381 --> 01:21:02.910
<v Speaker 5>trade for this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like not me.</v>

1788
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:05.820
<v Speaker 5>And then I ran it and I just jogged the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole way.</v>

1789
01:21:05.821 --> 01:21:09.840
<v Speaker 5>At 22 miles my calves seized up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My Quad sees dot.</v>

1790
01:21:09.841 --> 01:21:11.460
<v Speaker 5>Oh Mike and the woman in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit,</v>

1791
01:21:11.461 --> 01:21:13.650

<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1792
01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.010
<v Speaker 5>I saw her and she was like a an </v>
<v Speaker 5>executive.</v>

1793
01:21:17.011 --> 01:21:17.844
<v Speaker 5>She'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was like a bandaid went down one </v>

1794
01:21:20.221 --> 01:21:23.940
<v Speaker 5>leg up one cheek and everyone started </v>
<v Speaker 5>falling off like zombies.</v>

1795
01:21:23.941 --> 01:21:24.631
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1796
01:21:24.631 --> 01:21:27.480
<v Speaker 5>this is why you train.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I finished it.</v>

1797
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:29.143
<v Speaker 5>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so then men's health came to me and </v>

01:23:32.951 --> 01:23:35.380
<v Speaker 5>that's why I think your goal should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing an hour and 45.</v>

1856
01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:38.860
<v Speaker 5>But then I got out there and I got </v>
<v Speaker 5>competitive and almost died.</v>

1863
01:23:49.871 --> 01:23:50.704
<v Speaker 5>started climbing over and over top.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like a fucking mosh pit instead of </v>

1864
01:23:52.931 --> 01:23:56.200
<v Speaker 5>freaking out a hundred feet of water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>400 yards from the shore.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and I have,</v>

1965
01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.030
<v Speaker 5>it's just like pen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:56.300
<v Speaker 5>On a whim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Santana spon spontaneous idea.</v>

1967
01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:59.480
<v Speaker 5>I had a weekend off and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

1968
01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:01.430
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to probably be doing press.</v>

1969
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:03.860
<v Speaker 5>And I was like in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then part of me is like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just go to Paris.</v>

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.610
<v Speaker 5>That you're feeling adventurous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1972
01:28:06.611 --> 01:28:07.444
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'll put it on my stories and then </v>

1973
01:28:08.091 --> 01:28:08.924
<v Speaker 5>people can follow me in Paris and eat my</v>
<v Speaker 5>way through Paris and drink my way into </v>

1974
01:28:10.821 --> 01:28:13.200
<v Speaker 5>the night and then find out where I stay</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

1975
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.881
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1976
01:28:13.881 --> 01:28:14.720
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>

1977
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:15.910
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1978
01:28:15.911 --> 01:28:16.521
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened?</v>

1979
01:28:16.521 --> 01:28:18.860
<v Speaker 5>I asked this weekend where you guys go </v>
<v Speaker 5>in Santa Cruz,</v>

1980
01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:21.620
<v Speaker 5>Santa Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's my favorite place.</v>

1981
01:28:22.770 --> 01:28:26.030
<v Speaker 5>We lived there together for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Real love that place now.</v>

1982
01:28:26.031 --> 01:28:29.190
<v Speaker 5>Do you guys turn off your professional </v>
<v Speaker 5>life when you go do,</v>

1983
01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:30.940
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>

1984
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:34.700
<v Speaker 5>Last time we were there we were shooting</v>
<v Speaker 5>in blog and it's like,</v>

1985
01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:35.973
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's always kind of like you're half </v>

1986
01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:38.083
<v Speaker 5>basically with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I stopped doing the mind is </v>

1987
01:28:39.891 --> 01:28:43.280
<v Speaker 5>occupied with like when's that good shot</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming?</v>

1988
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:45.380
<v Speaker 5>That's why Casey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1989
01:28:45.381 --> 01:28:47.810
<v Speaker 5>it's I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's what I think about Casey Neistat is</v>

1990
01:28:47.811 --> 01:28:51.110
<v Speaker 5>like when he stopped doing his blog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1991
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:52.123
<v Speaker 5>thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he seems like he has a really </v>

1992
01:28:53.961 --> 01:28:54.794
<v Speaker 5>cool life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know that he's not getting to </v>

1993
01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:58.760
<v Speaker 5>taste it because when he's getting into </v>
<v Speaker 5>a helicopter,</v>

1994
01:28:58.761 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 5>he's also thinking of as an exterior </v>
<v Speaker 5>shot is his entry shot.</v>

1995
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:03.690
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Drone shot.</v>

1996
01:29:03.691 --> 01:29:06.110
<v Speaker 5>He's got all these Shari angles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1997
01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:11.150
<v Speaker 5>I mean that we've gone through that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why we pretty much stopped making</v>

1998
01:29:11.851 --> 01:29:15.030
<v Speaker 5>videos on our main channel and really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we don't,</v>

1999
01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:18.000
<v Speaker 5>we haven't posted there in a long time </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we just kind of one day we're like,</v>

2000
01:29:18.001 --> 01:29:22.110
<v Speaker 5>we can't sustain this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's too hard.</v>

2001
01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:23.940
<v Speaker 5>My daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll hear my daughter say stuff like,</v>

2002
01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:26.070
<v Speaker 5>everything doesn't need to go on </v>
<v Speaker 5>Instagram,</v>

2003
01:29:26.071 --> 01:29:27.180
<v Speaker 5>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're just like,</v>

2004
01:29:27.181 --> 01:29:28.010
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you,</v>

2005
01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:28.570
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

2006
01:29:28.570 --> 01:29:30.030
<v Speaker 5>it's about your relationship with it.</v>

2007
01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:33.120
<v Speaker 5>If it doesn't bother you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're excited and it's fun for you,</v>

2008
01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:35.780
<v Speaker 5>that's then that's wholesome and good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But for,</v>

2009
01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:36.660
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for us,</v>

2010
01:29:36.661 --> 01:29:37.494
<v Speaker 5>and I'm sure for Casey to where it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like it feels bad and you're aware that </v>

2011
01:29:42.451 --> 01:29:43.284
<v Speaker 5>it feels bad and you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing it and you're anxious and you're </v>

2012
01:29:45.001 --> 01:29:46.530
<v Speaker 5>stressed all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when it's bad.</v>

2013
01:29:46.531 --> 01:29:48.870
<v Speaker 5>But if you enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then God bless.</v>

2014
01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:49.793
<v Speaker 5>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I loved when you guys did that like a </v>

2015
01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:55.980
<v Speaker 5>kosher or was it called when you switch?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Switch proper was called flip flop.</v>

2016
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:58.410
<v Speaker 5>When you guys do both to something for </v>
<v Speaker 5>each other's channel.</v>

2017
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.353
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>colab,</v>

2018
01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:01.283
<v Speaker 5>Colab,</v>
<v Speaker 5>colab.</v>

2019
01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.110
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

2020
01:30:04.111 --> 01:30:04.944
<v Speaker 5>we did that.</v>

2021
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:11.430
<v Speaker 5>That was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like part of me was like,</v>

2022
01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:12.293
<v Speaker 5>I wish someone else had a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to see that points that you </v>

2023
01:30:15.181 --> 01:30:17.700
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to see what you guys didn't show.</v>

2024
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:19.370
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like again,</v>

2025
01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:21.960
<v Speaker 5>fascinating part for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I love about podcasts.</v>

2026
01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:22.770
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2027
01:30:22.770 --> 01:30:25.280
<v Speaker 5>you put your arm or down and you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>share sometimes.</v>

2028
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:27.540
<v Speaker 5>So if you don't like from wiping,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2029
01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:31.890
<v Speaker 5>because those videos are so edited from </v>
<v Speaker 5>two hours,</v>

2030
01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:35.130
<v Speaker 5>you could go down to 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's of course every time.</v>

2031
01:30:35.150 --> 01:30:36.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the current,</v>

2032
01:30:36.001 --> 01:30:37.830
<v Speaker 5>and that's why I love doing the show </v>
<v Speaker 5>live too,</v>

2033
01:30:37.831 --> 01:30:42.360
<v Speaker 5>because it's like no take backs dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all out there dude.</v>

2034
01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.313
<v Speaker 5>It makes you hold you accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's what I also love about the </v>

2035
01:30:45.301 --> 01:30:47.460
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've said this a number of times,</v>

2036
01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:48.593
<v Speaker 5>is that if you're watching this and </v>
<v Speaker 5>listening and you hear something you're </v>

2037
01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:51.693
<v Speaker 5>offended by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is an extension of social media </v>

2038
01:30:53.790 --> 01:30:54.623
<v Speaker 5>share what offends you with the person </v>
<v Speaker 5>creating it and explain to them why and </v>

2039
01:30:58.201 --> 01:31:01.050
<v Speaker 5>help change their mind as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like tattle tailing.</v>

2040
01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:04.300
<v Speaker 5>Like I've said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some fucked up stuff on my podcast,</v>

2041
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:08.100
<v Speaker 5>legit across the board and my friends </v>
<v Speaker 5>lawyers be like,</v>

2042
01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:11.400

2043
01:31:11.401 --> 01:31:15.840
<v Speaker 5>33 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 to check what you got to really think</v>

2044
01:31:15.841 --> 01:31:16.674
<v Speaker 5>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that everyone's laughing in the </v>

2045
01:31:17.401 --> 01:31:20.430
<v Speaker 5>room but it's not funny and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2046
01:31:20.431 --> 01:31:22.690
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I mean I've,</v>

2047
01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:23.933
<v Speaker 5>I dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was at the beginning of podcasting </v>

2048
01:31:24.570 --> 01:31:27.720
<v Speaker 5>when you could go out and say shit and </v>
<v Speaker 5>ruin friendships,</v>

2049
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:30.180
<v Speaker 5>they ain't even know you were doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were just like,</v>

2050
01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:31.860
<v Speaker 5>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how would that happen?</v>

2051
01:31:31.890 --> 01:31:35.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this comedian,</v>

2052
01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:36.553
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say his name because I don't want to </v>

2053
01:31:36.781 --> 01:31:37.614
<v Speaker 5>like put them on blast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he kind of like took a story from </v>

2054
01:31:40.801 --> 01:31:43.020
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what does that mean?</v>

2055
01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:43.580
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2056
01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:44.450
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2057
01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:47.130
<v Speaker 5>he was telling a story and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he was telling the story,</v>

2058
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:48.143
<v Speaker 5>he was saying that it happened to me and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was telling him on stage who's thing </v>

2059
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.340
<v Speaker 5>it having a bird habitat.</v>

2060
01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.450
<v Speaker 5>And then one day Tom [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were all three friends.</v>

2061
01:31:54.451 --> 01:31:55.530
<v Speaker 5>Tom called me and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man.</v>

2062
01:31:55.531 --> 01:31:57.390
<v Speaker 5>And just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's saying it happened to him.</v>

2063
01:31:57.391 --> 01:31:58.224
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he never really talked to me about </v>

2064
01:31:59.291 --> 01:32:00.880
<v Speaker 5>that and he just started doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>

2065
01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:03.130
<v Speaker 5>and you guys were close friends?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were pretty close.</v>

2066
01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:03.993
<v Speaker 5>But that's pretty taboo at right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was really taboo and I tried </v>

2067
01:32:07.781 --> 01:32:08.614
<v Speaker 5>to have a conversation with them and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was that a bit you want to do use </v>

2068
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:12.071
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2069
01:32:12.071 --> 01:32:15.220
<v Speaker 5>that's what's problematic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the problem was I didn't,</v>

2070
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:18.670
<v Speaker 5>I almost really didn't want the bid out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there because it was,</v>

2071
01:32:18.671 --> 01:32:20.470
<v Speaker 5>it's a great story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

2072
01:32:20.650 --> 01:32:22.030
<v Speaker 5>part of me was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

2073
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.133
<v Speaker 5>the person that's involved in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they may not remember that it happened </v>

2074
01:32:25.691 --> 01:32:26.524
<v Speaker 5>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They definitely don't know it didn't </v>

2075
01:32:27.401 --> 01:32:28.180
<v Speaker 5>happen to you.</v>

2076
01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:30.820
<v Speaker 5>But then when it comes back to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to be like,</v>

2077
01:32:30.821 --> 01:32:32.770
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm going to look like an asshole.</v>

2078
01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:34.930
<v Speaker 5>So I'd rather,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if I decide to do,</v>

2079
01:32:34.931 --> 01:32:36.700
<v Speaker 5>decide to tell it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to tell it on my timeline,</v>

2080
01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:38.230
<v Speaker 5>I want to be the one to be able to tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2081
01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:41.650
<v Speaker 5>I want to meet the guy that had happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>with and say again and go,</v>

2082
01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:43.870
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this story happened and this,</v>

2083
01:32:43.871 --> 01:32:45.400
<v Speaker 5>and it's a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I won't tell you the story,</v>

2084
01:32:45.401 --> 01:32:47.320
<v Speaker 5>but I'd like to tell it on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need your blessing.</v>

2085
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:48.303
<v Speaker 5>That's how I go about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this other guy just started saying </v>

2086
01:32:49.991 --> 01:32:50.824
<v Speaker 5>it happened to him and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I went on Joe's podcasts and </v>

2087
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:54.703
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Joe just asked me about it and this </v>

2088
01:32:56.531 --> 01:32:58.960
<v Speaker 5>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is probably like seven years ago,</v>

2089
01:32:58.961 --> 01:33:00.180
<v Speaker 5>eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

2090
01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.073
<v Speaker 5>And I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just told him like the way we're </v>

2091
01:33:02.771 --> 01:33:03.940
<v Speaker 5>talking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

2092
01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:08.980
<v Speaker 5>and I was unaware of how many people </v>
<v Speaker 5>were listening and all of a sudden,</v>

2093
01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:11.860
<v Speaker 5>and then it started a huge fight between</v>
<v Speaker 5>me and the guy.</v>

2094
01:33:11.861 --> 01:33:13.330
<v Speaker 5>And then the guy just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you,</v>

2095
01:33:13.331 --> 01:33:15.400
<v Speaker 5>you're not my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2096
01:33:15.670 --> 01:33:16.503
<v Speaker 5>it was just really confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I haven't spoken to the Chi since </v>

2097
01:33:19.810 --> 01:33:20.381
<v Speaker 5>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2098
01:33:20.381 --> 01:33:21.010
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2099
01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:21.980
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that,</v>

2100
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:24.520
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did that a couple people,</v>

2101
01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:28.150
<v Speaker 5>I would just get drunk on a podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 5>be honest.</v>

2102
01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:29.163
<v Speaker 5>That's the killer I used to get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to drink and I pretty much </v>

2103
01:33:32.471 --> 01:33:34.660
<v Speaker 5>stopped just because it's like when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're live,</v>

2104
01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:38.830
<v Speaker 5>you want to make sure that you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you mean.</v>

2105
01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:40.083
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I see I'm drunk so much that I'm </v>

2106
01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:43.440
<v Speaker 5>pretty bad cop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm of,</v>

2107
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:44.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm a flip tables.</v>

2108
01:33:44.530 --> 01:33:45.363
<v Speaker 5>When I'm driving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember that may have been the last </v>

2109
01:33:47.891 --> 01:33:49.250
<v Speaker 5>time I drank for real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2110
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:51.040
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were a couple,</v>

2111
01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:52.550
<v Speaker 5>a couple in between.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2112
01:33:52.570 --> 01:33:54.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty cool being drunk and I,</v>

2113
01:33:54.931 --> 01:33:57.220
<v Speaker 5>and still biting my tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I,</v>

2114
01:33:57.221 --> 01:33:58.054
<v Speaker 5>if I know it's going to hurt somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if it's about me or like my </v>

2115
01:34:00.431 --> 01:34:01.480
<v Speaker 5>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just share them.</v>

2116
01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:02.913
<v Speaker 5>And if I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they're messed up then I'll either </v>

2117
01:34:04.691 --> 01:34:05.800
<v Speaker 5>defend them or go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

01:34:05.801 --> 01:34:06.634
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm wrong.</v>

2119
01:34:06.670 --> 01:34:08.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucked it up,</v>

2120
01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I drink a lot.</v>

2121
01:34:10.450 --> 01:34:11.830
<v Speaker 5>What did the guy say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

2122
01:34:11.831 --> 01:34:12.664
<v Speaker 5>how did he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how did he come to terms with having </v>

2123
01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.170
<v Speaker 5>stuff stole your bet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

2124
01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:20.350
<v Speaker 5>the last thing he said to me was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2125
01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:21.663
<v Speaker 5>you are a garbage human being piece of </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit and you have no friends and you'll </v>

2126
01:34:26.111 --> 01:34:26.944
<v Speaker 5>realize in a year that you'll have that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I was the only friend you ever had and </v>

2127
01:34:30.970 --> 01:34:33.670
<v Speaker 5>you have no friends and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

2128
01:34:33.671 --> 01:34:34.510
<v Speaker 5>lose my number.</v>

2129
01:34:34.630 --> 01:34:36.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't ever want to speak to you again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're dead to me.</v>

2130
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:38.020
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>

2131
01:34:38.021 --> 01:34:38.854
<v Speaker 5>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so confusing at the time because </v>

2132
01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.020
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought we were okay.</v>

2133
01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:45.460
<v Speaker 5>Like I thought we were going to figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>this out,</v>

2134
01:34:45.610 --> 01:34:46.443
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I thought we could figure all of </v>

2135
01:34:48.311 --> 01:34:51.430
<v Speaker 5>this out and everyone was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>fine and he just said that.</v>

2136
01:34:51.431 --> 01:34:55.650
<v Speaker 5>And at that point it was brother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was Christmas eve and like,</v>

2137
01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:59.510
<v Speaker 5>and and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I went on a hike up to the mountains</v>

2138
01:34:59.511 --> 01:35:03.950
<v Speaker 5>with my daughters and to the Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 5>sign and I got up there and I thought,</v>

2139
01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:05.413
<v Speaker 5>I'm putting so much energy in trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>fix this when the guy doesn't want to </v>

2140
01:35:08.511 --> 01:35:10.880
<v Speaker 5>fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And to be honest with you,</v>

2141
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:12.470
<v Speaker 5>I go in and clear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>conscious,</v>

2142
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:13.970
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do anything wrong.</v>

2143
01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.770
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do anything wrong.</v>

2144
01:35:15.771 --> 01:35:17.300
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got to let this go.</v>

2145
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:20.480
<v Speaker 5>This is Christmas Eve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I let it go that day.</v>

2146
01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:21.740
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my wife said to me,</v>

2147
01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.660
<v Speaker 5>let it go right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never.</v>

2148
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:26.600
<v Speaker 5>Don't talk to the about this for there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There used to be,</v>

2149
01:35:26.601 --> 01:35:27.434
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a funny word we used to use to </v>

2150
01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.580
<v Speaker 5>about not talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she's like,</v>

2151
01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:35.480
<v Speaker 5>let it go now and just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you can't be friends with him.</v>

2152
01:35:35.490 --> 01:35:37.520
<v Speaker 5>He never talked to him again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just he's out of your life.</v>

2153
01:35:37.521 --> 01:35:39.020
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what he wants.</v>

2154
01:35:39.021 --> 01:35:40.700
<v Speaker 5>That's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what you need.</v>

2155
01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:44.200
<v Speaker 5>Then do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I did just haven't spoken to him and</v>

2156
01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.850
<v Speaker 5>that's good advice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's hard to let go.</v>

2157
01:35:46.851 --> 01:35:47.684
<v Speaker 5>People go out of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a breakup with a friend and be </v>

<v Speaker 5>and that manager tried to negotiate a,</v>

2190
01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:04.701
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost like,</v>

2191
01:37:04.701 --> 01:37:05.480
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2192
01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.270
<v Speaker 5>getting back together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I had said,</v>

2193
01:37:08.410 --> 01:37:09.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when that thing went down,</v>

2194
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:10.603
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

2197
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:14.540
<v Speaker 5>And then I grew into like a different </v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2198
01:37:14.541 --> 01:37:15.374
<v Speaker 5>that guy I am today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think I could ever go back </v>

2199
01:37:16.881 --> 01:37:18.240
<v Speaker 5>to the guy that he knew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she,</v>

2200
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:19.123
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that would even work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've seen him on twitter and </v>

2201
01:37:21.141 --> 01:37:21.974
<v Speaker 5>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So every now and then and he seems like </v>

<v Speaker 5>he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll say,</v>

2203
01:37:24.381 --> 01:37:25.910
<v Speaker 5>all I'll say is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know,</v>

2204
01:37:25.911 --> 01:37:28.550
<v Speaker 5>but it seems like he's doing very well </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he seems like he's very happy.</v>

2205
01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:30.253
<v Speaker 5>I feel like he's gone through a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like he's found peace in his </v>

2206
01:37:33.081 --> 01:37:33.650
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

2207
01:37:33.650 --> 01:37:36.440
<v Speaker 5>Like I saw him on a sincere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went flipped through his instagram the</v>

2208
01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:37.490
<v Speaker 5>other day and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm almost happy for him.</v>

2210
01:37:39.231 --> 01:37:43.040
<v Speaker 5>Like he seems like he's in so much of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>better place than I ever knew him to be.</v>

2211
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:44.840
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I got in bed that night and I was like,</v>

2260
01:39:38.551 --> 01:39:41.850
<v Speaker 5>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should have never shown them the man</v>

2261
01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:43.490
<v Speaker 5>behind the curtain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I was like,</v>

2262
01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:48.500
<v Speaker 5>why would you ever be honest since that </v>
<v Speaker 5>day have did,</v>

2263
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.033
<v Speaker 5>was that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you know that people were gonna </v>

2264
01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:51.780
<v Speaker 5>react that way?</v>

2265
01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:52.613
<v Speaker 5>Like I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you think that was somewhat normal </v>

2266
01:39:54.151 --> 01:39:55.610
<v Speaker 5>amount to be drinking a day?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

2267
01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:57.240
<v Speaker 5>it just got there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just got,</v>

2268
01:39:57.241 --> 01:40:00.420
<v Speaker 5>there weren't any scale backs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so when we did sober October,</v>

2269
01:40:00.421 --> 01:40:01.254
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't drink for a month and then I </v>

2270
01:40:02.251 --> 01:40:03.084
<v Speaker 5>went on a tear in November obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then what happened is I started </v>

2271
01:40:06.211 --> 01:40:07.044
<v Speaker 5>getting rid of my specials.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I shot it in February and then I was </v>

2272
01:40:08.971 --> 01:40:12.090
<v Speaker 5>like the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is going to sound so fucking silly.</v>

2273
01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.730
<v Speaker 5>The biggest thing I learned in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2274
01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.730
<v Speaker 5>in after sober October was that I can go</v>
<v Speaker 5>to sleep sober.</v>

2275
01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.370
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't need to like put myself to </v>
<v Speaker 5>sleep.</v>

2276
01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:23.370
<v Speaker 5>I could just go lay in a bed and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this will happen.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I had to have a drink.</v>

2279
01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:28.920
<v Speaker 5>I'd have a drink to go to bed.</v>

2280
01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.900
<v Speaker 5>I liked that it was the way I wrapped up</v>
<v Speaker 5>my night.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I've seen documentaries of of alcohol </v>

2304
01:41:14.921 --> 01:41:15.754
<v Speaker 5>addicts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a special kind of like these guys </v>

2305
01:41:17.231 --> 01:41:21.220
<v Speaker 5>drink whole bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very different than that.</v>

2306
01:41:21.250 --> 01:41:22.083
<v Speaker 5>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a doctor so anyone listening do </v>

2307
01:41:23.231 --> 01:41:25.570
<v Speaker 5>not listen to what I'm telling you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it worked for me.</v>

2308
01:41:25.571 --> 01:41:26.404
<v Speaker 5>Do not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have a freak body that you run </v>

2309
01:41:27.761 --> 01:41:31.200
<v Speaker 5>triathlons and drink drinks a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit,</v>

2310
01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.610
<v Speaker 5>what happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so we did sober October and then all</v>

2311
01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:36.060
<v Speaker 5>of a sudden you're like a successful </v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot ice.</v>

2312
01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:37.500
<v Speaker 5>You don't have no idea.</v>

2313
01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:40.803
<v Speaker 5>You have an incredible body you adore </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you achieve despite your efforts to </v>

2314
01:41:45.431 --> 01:41:48.880
<v Speaker 5>just destroy your own body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

2315
01:41:48.881 --> 01:41:49.630
<v Speaker 5>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't,</v>

2316
01:41:49.630 --> 01:41:51.910
<v Speaker 5>I just quit drinking and then there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2317
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:55.630
<v Speaker 5>like I felt no withdrawals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt no really bounce back.</v>

2318
01:41:55.631 --> 01:41:58.270
<v Speaker 5>I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh your blood.</v>

2319
01:41:58.271 --> 01:42:00.910
<v Speaker 5>And like I felt no need to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just was like,</v>

2320
01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:02.380
<v Speaker 5>I was like animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like DNA.</v>

2321
01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:04.090
<v Speaker 5>It was a cool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then when I started drinking,</v>

2322
01:42:04.091 --> 01:42:06.430
<v Speaker 5>I only started because we were in no new</v>
<v Speaker 5>orleans.</v>

2323
01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.070
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was with Ari and he's like,</v>

2324
01:42:09.071 --> 01:42:10.840
<v Speaker 5>let's get fucking drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And where I was like,</v>

2325
01:42:10.841 --> 01:42:13.960
<v Speaker 5>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we've got a buzz gun and not drank a</v>

2326
01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:16.860
<v Speaker 5>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then in November I got the offer,</v>

2327
01:42:16.861 --> 01:42:20.530
<v Speaker 5>or like end of October I got the offer </v>
<v Speaker 5>for Netflix and I was like,</v>

2328
01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.760
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I got to get to work.</v>

2329
01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:25.450
<v Speaker 5>And so I just scaled back my drinking to</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2330
01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I wanted to party I could party,</v>

2331
01:42:27.521 --> 01:42:31.600
<v Speaker 5>but I had to focus on the special right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't drink leading up to this special,</v>

2332
01:42:31.601 --> 01:42:34.090
<v Speaker 5>did the special and the La Marathon was </v>
<v Speaker 5>around the corner.</v>

2333
01:42:34.091 --> 01:42:36.040
<v Speaker 5>It didn't drink going into that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then,</v>

2334
01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:37.990
<v Speaker 5>and then like partied,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2335
01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:39.130
<v Speaker 5>but then was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2336
01:42:39.131 --> 01:42:40.440
<v Speaker 5>triathlons coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Drinking.</v>

2337
01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:41.680
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm not drinking right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2338
01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:42.753
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what's scary is I don't like </v>

2339
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:45.640
<v Speaker 5>want to tell people like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not drinking.</v>

2340
01:42:45.850 --> 01:42:47.950
<v Speaker 5>Like that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I drink if I want to drink.</v>

2341
01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:48.813
<v Speaker 5>Like if I wanted to drink tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm taking a car service down to Irvine </v>

2342
01:42:52.001 --> 01:42:54.010
<v Speaker 5>and taking it back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in my head I'm like,</v>

2343
01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:54.873
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should I drink tonight because I don't </v>

2344
01:42:55.751 --> 01:42:57.100
<v Speaker 5>have to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2345
01:42:57.101 --> 01:42:57.934
<v Speaker 5>I got two shows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't mind a cocktail on like a </v>

2346
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.690
<v Speaker 5>late show when I start the machine </v>
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>

2347
01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:02.913
<v Speaker 5>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I'll text my friend and see if we </v>

2348
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:05.590
<v Speaker 5>go for a bike ride a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we go for a bike ride,</v>

2349
01:43:05.591 --> 01:43:06.424
<v Speaker 5>I won't drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm definitely drinking Saturday </v>

2350
01:43:07.511 --> 01:43:10.510
<v Speaker 5>night because like we're taking a party </v>
<v Speaker 5>bus down to Irvine.</v>

2351
01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:12.040
<v Speaker 5>All our friends were on it and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2352
01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:14.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to party on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to party back.</v>

2353
01:43:14.231 --> 01:43:15.700
<v Speaker 5>We're doing a screening of my special </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ed.</v>

2354
01:43:15.701 --> 01:43:17.620
<v Speaker 5>My friend's house got a big screening </v>
<v Speaker 5>room.</v>

2355
01:43:17.770 --> 01:43:19.690
<v Speaker 5>I go and party is that day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I was like,</v>

2356
01:43:19.691 --> 01:43:20.524
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing own Monday so I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Marty like I'll probably scale back </v>

2357
01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:25.530
<v Speaker 5>early Sunday night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

2358
01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:28.780
<v Speaker 5>but I got on a red eye to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm partying basically your whole week.</v>

2359
01:43:31.570 --> 01:43:32.403
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just look at what I can break and I </v>

2360
01:43:34.721 --> 01:43:35.261
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

2361
01:43:35.261 --> 01:43:37.510
<v Speaker 5>we got to know something good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish,</v>

2362
01:43:37.570 --> 01:43:39.160
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2363
01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:43.270
<v Speaker 5>I wish I enjoyed drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do enjoy,</v>

2364
01:43:43.271 --> 01:43:48.271
<v Speaker 5>we'd either you see people smoking and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they seem to enjoy it so much and when I</v>

2365
01:43:48.281 --> 01:43:50.140
<v Speaker 5>smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that happens to me.</v>

2366
01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.640
<v Speaker 5>They say it happy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hungry,</v>

2367
01:43:52.641 --> 01:43:53.780
<v Speaker 5>sleepy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all happens.</v>

2368
01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:58.040
<v Speaker 5>What happens to me is fucking paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>depressed,</v>

2369
01:43:59.270 --> 01:44:01.490
<v Speaker 5>gluttonous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obsessive,</v>

2370
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:04.160
<v Speaker 5>obsessive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>panic attack.</v>

2371
01:44:04.170 --> 01:44:09.170
<v Speaker 5>He Oh miserable too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then people will be like,</v>

2372
01:44:09.651 --> 01:44:10.820
<v Speaker 5>you want him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're best friends.</v>

2373
01:44:10.821 --> 01:44:13.040
<v Speaker 5>We talk together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you say no,</v>

2374
01:44:13.041 --> 01:44:13.874
<v Speaker 5>it's like such a disappointment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I don't want to blaze my best </v>

2375
01:44:18.231 --> 01:44:18.890
<v Speaker 5>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2376
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:21.770
<v Speaker 5>Would it be great if they had fake weed </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you could just hit it low,</v>

2377
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:22.401
<v Speaker 5>gritty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

2378
01:44:22.401 --> 01:44:27.040
<v Speaker 5>But you had that moment of connection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I like,</v>

2379
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:30.080
<v Speaker 5>I like like a nice one hitter of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I've greenlit.</v>

2380
01:44:30.110 --> 01:44:31.910
<v Speaker 5>Like where I go to my own dispensary and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2381
01:44:31.911 --> 01:44:34.250
<v Speaker 5>here's what I'm looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that.</v>

2382
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:37.370
<v Speaker 5>But only like one hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then what I do now,</v>

2383
01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:38.204
<v Speaker 5>I'm probably more of is I'll take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll have a drink and then I'll take a </v>

2384
01:44:40.161 --> 01:44:43.250
<v Speaker 5>one hitter and then I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I can relate to one.</v>

2385
01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:44.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you mix and mash.</v>

2386
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:46.730
<v Speaker 5>Just one hit of weed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2387
01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:48.590
<v Speaker 5>That is what I enjoyed the most.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I'm drawing,</v>

2388
01:44:48.591 --> 01:44:50.000
<v Speaker 5>it takes the edge off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see,</v>

2389
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:56.900
<v Speaker 5>I can't go because I to not go just </v>
<v Speaker 5>wheat.</v>

2390
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:59.700
<v Speaker 5>That is my head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can just get high and go.</v>

2391
01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.630
<v Speaker 5>That's why I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't get it.</v>

2392
01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:05.270
<v Speaker 5>And the only reason it's tolerable is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're just,</v>

2393
01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:10.450
<v Speaker 5>you're so drunk that you can't even eat </v>
<v Speaker 5>edibles in my man cave one time.</v>

2394
01:45:10.801 --> 01:45:12.280
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were little goldfish,</v>

2395
01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:13.280
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm sitting there,</v>

2396
01:45:13.281 --> 01:45:14.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm hanging out and drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

2397
01:45:14.781 --> 01:45:15.460
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>

2398
01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:15.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2399
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:17.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in that buzzed.</v>

2400
01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:18.680
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got these edibles.</v>

2401
01:45:18.681 --> 01:45:20.270
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to watch a cool movie.</v>

2402
01:45:20.271 --> 01:45:22.780
<v Speaker 5>And I eat the out of bulls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>barely shrinking.</v>

2403
01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:24.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna put me to sleep.</v>

2404
01:45:24.201 --> 01:45:27.290
<v Speaker 5>And all of a sudden I feel my butthole </v>
<v Speaker 5>melt into the couch.</v>

2405
01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:28.550
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2406
01:45:28.551 --> 01:45:30.440
<v Speaker 5>something's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Call my sisters.</v>

2407
01:45:30.441 --> 01:45:30.921
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2408
01:45:30.921 --> 01:45:32.740
<v Speaker 5>how many of those goldfish should I have</v>
<v Speaker 5>had?</v>

2409
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:35.150
<v Speaker 5>They're like one and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I the handful.</v>

2410
01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.250
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>buckle up big boy.</v>

2411
01:45:37.251 --> 01:45:40.160
<v Speaker 5>You're in for a ride.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I just where I was like,</v>

2412
01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:41.390
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whiskey,</v>

2413
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:43.170
<v Speaker 5>you got to beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I just thought,</v>

2414
01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:46.520
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish.</v>

2415
01:45:46.521 --> 01:45:48.470
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2416
01:45:48.471 --> 01:45:50.840
<v Speaker 5>not good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I laid,</v>

2417
01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:53.160
<v Speaker 5>I ended up in bed not forgetting how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>breathe,</v>

2418
01:45:55.110 --> 01:45:55.943
<v Speaker 5>how to breathe.</v>

2419
01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:01.780
<v Speaker 4>That's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2420
01:46:01.781 --> 01:46:02.614
<v Speaker 4>two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do this on her road or do we have to </v>

2421
01:46:03.581 --> 01:46:04.414
<v Speaker 4>think it through?</v>

2422
01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:13.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the joy of smoking weed.</v>

2423
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:17.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to chase.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wished that I had something to unwind.</v>

2424
01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.670
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I don't buy any hobbies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't enjoy drugs.</v>

2425
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.863
<v Speaker 5>Does that what being depressed is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I wonder if stuff I say I </v>

2426
01:46:22.641 --> 01:46:24.800
<v Speaker 5>don't enjoy anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Am I depressed?</v>

2427
01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:27.290
<v Speaker 5>And the answer is probably yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

2428
01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:28.700
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>This is Super Meta,</v>

2433
01:46:34.610 --> 01:46:37.280
<v Speaker 5>but we're battling with something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our parents never had to battle.</v>

2434
01:46:37.281 --> 01:46:39.680
<v Speaker 5>Our parents never got to follow their </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreams.</v>

2435
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:43.490
<v Speaker 5>So when they had a job at an insurance </v>
<v Speaker 5>company or my dad was a lawyer,</v>

2436
01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:45.170
<v Speaker 5>he then got off work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

2437
01:46:45.171 --> 01:46:47.180
<v Speaker 5>I hate that and I'm going to do what I </v>
<v Speaker 5>love.</v>

2438
01:46:47.710 --> 01:46:49.320
<v Speaker 5>I only do what I love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

2439
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:51.840

2440
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:54.390
<v Speaker 5>my therapist was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need a hobby.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I have a hobby at shooting of log.</v>

2442
01:46:56.041 --> 01:46:57.060
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not a hobby.</v>

2443
01:46:57.130 --> 01:46:59.370
<v Speaker 5>So we'll know editing videos as a hobby </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes,</v>

2445
01:47:00.391 --> 01:47:01.290
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not a hobby.</v>

2446

<v Speaker 5>making leather wallets and stuff,</v>

2451
01:47:13.110 --> 01:47:14.460

2454
01:47:17.791 --> 01:47:18.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't escape it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2455
01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:19.673

<v Speaker 2>you see them closing my eyes because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>cherishing it so much worse.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I said this,</v>

2466
01:47:47.291 --> 01:47:50.450
<v Speaker 5>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to have a job where I built</v>

2467
01:47:50.451 --> 01:47:53.740
<v Speaker 5>fences and then I read my work there and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

2468
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:56.840
<v Speaker 5>I bet you would love to build fences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come home and be like,</v>

2469
01:47:57.110 --> 01:47:59.540
<v Speaker 5>who wants to go swimming?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But everyone was like,</v>

2470
01:47:59.541 --> 01:48:00.430
<v Speaker 5>dad's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh.</v>

2471
01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:02.390
<v Speaker 5>And I didn't pull out instagram and be </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2472
01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:03.373
<v Speaker 5>we're getting in the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got two shows in Irvine and I think </v>

2473
01:48:05.031 --> 01:48:08.180
<v Speaker 5>it's like 30 days left the late show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I would love to do that.</v>

2474
01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:12.050
<v Speaker 5>But then you go that guy building fences</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's like,</v>

2475
01:48:12.230 --> 01:48:13.430
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got a podcast.</v>

2476
01:48:13.431 --> 01:48:14.960
<v Speaker 5>It's a pie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a passion project.</v>

2477
01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:16.430
<v Speaker 5>It's my hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

2478
01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:17.630
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's my job.</v>

2479
01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:22.790
<v Speaker 2>I remember what I remember is those </v>
<v Speaker 2>great weekends but,</v>

2480
01:48:23.570 --> 01:48:24.403
<v Speaker 2>but what I forget so easily is sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight hours soullessly and feeling the </v>

2481
01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:34.370
<v Speaker 2>minutes of your life take away down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drain.</v>

2482
01:48:34.730 --> 01:48:39.320
<v Speaker 2>You're finite energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your creative energy,</v>

2483
01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.920
<v Speaker 2>the essence of who you are going down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>train every fucking minute.</v>

2484
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:48.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what I feel like on movie sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awful.</v>

2485
01:48:49.130 --> 01:48:53.030
<v Speaker 5>It's really worth remembering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just sit there and I go,</v>

2486
01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.690
<v Speaker 5>I am wasting fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even good at this.</v>

2487
01:48:57.110 --> 01:48:57.943
<v Speaker 5>Why I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want me to bring something </v>

2488
01:48:59.451 --> 01:49:00.670
<v Speaker 5>original.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to do it.</v>

2489
01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:02.210
<v Speaker 5>I know what it felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

2490
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:03.780
<v Speaker 5>I cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2491
01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.100
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't mind doing a multicam or it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like burt walks in and they're like,</v>

2492
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:10.070
<v Speaker 5>and they're like dad's home and you hear</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole studio logs.</v>

2493
01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:15.740
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I couldn't,</v>

2494
01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:17.580
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I could.</v>

2495
01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:20.040
<v Speaker 2>You have long days on set cause I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>never been on set.</v>

2496

<v Speaker 5>like Dave Chappelle,</v>

2499
01:49:27.311 --> 01:49:30.280
<v Speaker 5>you probably write a script,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like you multitask.</v>

2500
01:49:30.370 --> 01:49:33.040
<v Speaker 5>I can multitask.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess I don't multitask.</v>

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2885
02:06:32.410 --> 02:06:36.520
<v Speaker 5>the generator went out and so we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have electricity for an hour and a half.</v>

2886
02:06:36.610 --> 02:06:37.443
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>

2887
02:06:37.450 --> 02:06:39.670
<v Speaker 5>the first show I had to wait in the rain</v>
<v Speaker 5>for an hour and a half.</v>

2888
02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:41.800
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And lose their buzz.</v>

2889
02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:44.380
<v Speaker 5>And then we brought him in and sat them.</v>

2890
02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:46.300
<v Speaker 5>They're wet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're unhappy man.</v>

2891
02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:48.550
<v Speaker 5>Tough crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's Philly.</v>

2892
02:06:48.730 --> 02:06:50.160
<v Speaker 5>That's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're actually,</v>

2893
02:06:50.170 --> 02:06:52.600
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you shit if you're recording </v>
<v Speaker 5>your special fucking soaking wet.</v>

2894
02:06:53.290 --> 02:06:54.123
<v Speaker 5>My girl's hair is all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then the first show was not the </v>

2895
02:06:57.941 --> 02:06:58.900
<v Speaker 5>best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was okay.</v>

2896
02:06:58.901 --> 02:07:00.520
<v Speaker 5>It was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an 80 out of a hundred,</v>

2897
02:07:00.521 --> 02:07:02.560
<v Speaker 5>but when you shoot a special,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want a hundred.</v>

2898
02:07:02.561 --> 02:07:03.394
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I went upstairs and I sat with my </v>

2899
02:07:05.201 --> 02:07:07.420
<v Speaker 5>buddy Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we had a coffee and I,</v>

2900
02:07:07.421 --> 02:07:08.290
<v Speaker 5>he left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2901
02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.330
<v Speaker 5>I've always said I like to be an under </v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure.</v>

2902
02:07:10.331 --> 02:07:12.520
<v Speaker 5>I love La,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love things live.</v>

2903
02:07:12.521 --> 02:07:15.160
<v Speaker 5>I love the pressure of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like time to prove it.</v>

2904
02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:17.710
<v Speaker 5>And I went out and literally had the </v>
<v Speaker 5>best set of my,</v>

2905
02:07:17.711 --> 02:07:20.650
<v Speaker 5>like one of the best sets of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but getting to end,</v>

2906
02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:21.933
<v Speaker 5>I mean to the point where I screwed </v>
<v Speaker 5>around and I added some shit and then I </v>

2907
02:07:25.331 --> 02:07:26.164
<v Speaker 5>was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I keep it in it and it was the best set </v>

2908
02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:28.930
<v Speaker 5>of my life.</v>

2909
02:07:28.930 --> 02:07:29.763
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it went live last night and I was </v>

2910
02:07:32.531 --> 02:07:33.850
<v Speaker 5>looking like on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2911
02:07:33.851 --> 02:07:36.250
<v Speaker 5>you kind of gingerly and see like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

2912
02:07:36.251 --> 02:07:39.460
<v Speaker 5>what's something bad?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything's been good.</v>

2913
02:07:39.461 --> 02:07:40.390
<v Speaker 5>So you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

2914
02:07:40.391 --> 02:07:41.224
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm good.</v>

2915
02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:42.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just let it sit out there,</v>

2916
02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:43.453
<v Speaker 5>live out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People can watch it and enjoy it if you </v>

2917
02:07:44.981 --> 02:07:45.814
<v Speaker 5>don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people at this point that they </v>

2918
02:07:47.531 --> 02:07:49.090
<v Speaker 5>don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to take the time to go</v>

2919
02:07:49.091 --> 02:07:51.700
<v Speaker 5>and hate it online.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I probably won't see that,</v>

2920
02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:55.030
<v Speaker 5>hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's been a good response.</v>

2921
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:57.100
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and people like you guys have liked it.</v>

2922
02:07:57.101 --> 02:07:58.950
<v Speaker 5>So we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe liked it.</v>

2923
02:07:59.450 --> 02:08:00.283
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

2924
02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:01.413
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we're like dying not to blow smoke </v>

2925
02:08:04.541 --> 02:08:05.690
<v Speaker 5>up your ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but come on in,</v>

2926
02:08:05.691 --> 02:08:08.080
<v Speaker 5>you're in one of the top guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tall,</v>

2927
02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:12.190
<v Speaker 5>very gray.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nobody that's going to turn that</v>

2928
02:08:12.191 --> 02:08:13.900
<v Speaker 5>on and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy's fucking sucks.</v>

2929
02:08:15.490 --> 02:08:17.050
<v Speaker 5>Top class dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're killing it.</v>

2930
02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:18.100
<v Speaker 5>It's been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been,</v>

2931
02:08:18.130 --> 02:08:21.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm very happy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think the real struggle is to make</v>

2932
02:08:21.251 --> 02:08:22.084
<v Speaker 5>sure you have a new hour so that when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're touring now people come out to </v>

2933
02:08:24.551 --> 02:08:28.270
<v Speaker 5>see when they see all the material.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I got a new 52 minutes.</v>

2934
02:08:28.330 --> 02:08:28.930
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2935
02:08:28.930 --> 02:08:31.690
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how long does it take you to prep?</v>

2936
02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.610
<v Speaker 5>Like a whole hour like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2937
02:08:33.710 --> 02:08:34.290
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from,</v>

2939
02:08:35.231 --> 02:08:39.360
<v Speaker 5>from February until now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

2940
02:08:39.570 --> 02:08:42.490
<v Speaker 5>about six months to write a new hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You spent how many?</v>

2941
02:08:42.491 --> 02:08:43.324
<v Speaker 5>Just great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

2942
02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:45.790
<v Speaker 5>it's not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a new hour of that.</v>

2943
02:08:45.791 --> 02:08:50.791
<v Speaker 5>I can stand and talk and then from this </v>
<v Speaker 5>six months till the next six months,</v>

2944
02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:52.223
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll get tighter and I'll add some new </v>

2945
02:08:53.891 --> 02:08:54.724
<v Speaker 5>bits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll find some new transitions and I'll </v>

2946
02:08:56.261 --> 02:08:58.260
<v Speaker 5>make things stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2947
02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:01.120
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you hopefully you talking about</v>

2948
02:09:01.121 --> 02:09:02.710
<v Speaker 5>your show that you've been thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

2949
02:09:02.890 --> 02:09:04.720
<v Speaker 5>the standup show I'm doing on the road </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>

2950
02:09:04.750 --> 02:09:06.730
<v Speaker 5>the one I'm doing tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nirvana still evolving.</v>

2951
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:08.920
<v Speaker 5>And so you're still evolving this one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's good.</v>

2952
02:09:08.921 --> 02:09:13.000
<v Speaker 5>It's an hour of like new material.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You fuck around a little bit on stage.</v>

2953
02:09:13.001 --> 02:09:14.980
<v Speaker 5>You have fun in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Little crowd work.</v>

2954
02:09:15.010 --> 02:09:16.390
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've been doing standup so I can,</v>

2955
02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:19.480
<v Speaker 5>I can cheat it for an hour but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I,</v>

2956
02:09:19.490 --> 02:09:22.450
<v Speaker 5>then at the end I ask whatever stories </v>
<v Speaker 5>people want to hear and they always said</v>

2957
02:09:22.451 --> 02:09:23.284
<v Speaker 5>the machine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell the machine lying dildos are </v>

2958
02:09:24.521 --> 02:09:25.354
<v Speaker 5>the ones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone noise once and the next six </v>

2959
02:09:27.401 --> 02:09:28.234
<v Speaker 5>months it gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you should get an offer within </v>

2960
02:09:30.371 --> 02:09:32.920
<v Speaker 5>three months after that have to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>another special,</v>

2961
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:36.280
<v Speaker 5>like 18 months is the period of s the </v>
<v Speaker 5>life,</v>

2962
02:09:36.281 --> 02:09:38.200
<v Speaker 5>the distance train specials.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It should be.</v>

2963
02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:39.093
<v Speaker 5>And so how is there a process?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So by the time you're doing the Netflix </v>

2964
02:09:42.161 --> 02:09:43.900
<v Speaker 5>special,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've already done this show.</v>

2965
02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:45.850
<v Speaker 5>Tons of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2966
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:47.380
<v Speaker 5>So there's no rehearsing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

2967
02:09:47.770 --> 02:09:49.820
<v Speaker 5>I know this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh well what happens is like you,</v>

2968
02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:51.790
<v Speaker 5>I did my one special one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gave it to you.</v>

2969
02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:52.653
<v Speaker 5>And then I wrote my new hour and then I </v>
<v Speaker 5>worked at and I knew what I liked and </v>

2970
02:09:55.421 --> 02:09:56.254
<v Speaker 5>knew I had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My one big piece that I loved was the </v>

2971
02:09:58.031 --> 02:10:00.220
<v Speaker 5>zip lining story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was like the center.</v>

2972
02:10:00.221 --> 02:10:03.610
<v Speaker 5>So I wanted to work and the way Netflix </v>
<v Speaker 5>works to people only watch 32 hours,</v>

2973
02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:06.010
<v Speaker 5>32 minutes and not sure they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2974
02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:06.933
<v Speaker 5>so I wanted to put that in the middle so</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if you were going to only watch 32 </v>

2975
02:10:09.281 --> 02:10:11.110
<v Speaker 5>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some medium bit,</v>

2976
02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:13.450
<v Speaker 5>it's like a really great bit so that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>go well,</v>

2977
02:10:13.451 --> 02:10:15.170
<v Speaker 5>shit and home watching the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2978
02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:17.820
<v Speaker 5>So I wanted the tent pole round that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2979
02:10:17.890 --> 02:10:20.830
<v Speaker 5>and so I think I did a properly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2980
02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:22.270
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2981
02:10:22.270 --> 02:10:26.350
<v Speaker 5>but what happened is by the time I got </v>
<v Speaker 5>the offer in like the end of October,</v>

2982
02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:28.240
<v Speaker 5>middle of October,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe when I got the offer,</v>

2983
02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:30.250
<v Speaker 5>I then said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2984
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.140
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking on.</v>

2985
02:10:32.170 --> 02:10:34.670
<v Speaker 5>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm taping it in February,</v>

2990
02:10:45.231 --> 02:10:47.120
<v Speaker 5>cities and go a weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two shows,</v>

2991
02:10:47.121 --> 02:10:48.890
<v Speaker 5>Thursday two shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Friday two shows Saturday.</v>

2992
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:49.783
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I did that cause you want to take </v>

2993
02:10:51.051 --> 02:10:52.940
<v Speaker 5>that hour and you want to make it tight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you record it,</v>

2994
02:10:53.090 --> 02:10:55.430
<v Speaker 5>you watch it and you find out where the </v>
<v Speaker 5>loose parts are,</v>

2995
02:10:55.431 --> 02:10:56.264
<v Speaker 5>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you can just see lazy writing and </v>

2996
02:10:57.741 --> 02:11:01.520
<v Speaker 5>then you find a joke there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you've taped it and washed it back,</v>

2997
02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:03.710
<v Speaker 5>like watching like a baseball replay or </v>
<v Speaker 5>some shit.</v>

2998
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:04.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>

2999
02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:05.193
<v Speaker 5>well what it is is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you look at the whole hour and then </v>

3000
02:11:06.831 --> 02:11:07.664
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3001
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:09.770
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this fits working in this Pittsburgh,</v>

3002
02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:11.190
<v Speaker 5>this what's working,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's not working.</v>

3003
02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:13.730
<v Speaker 5>Then you find the one that's not working</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you really focus on that,</v>

3004
02:11:13.731 --> 02:11:14.564
<v Speaker 5>punch it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make sure it's got an ending of middle </v>

3005
02:11:15.861 --> 02:11:16.580
<v Speaker 5>of beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it.</v>

3006
02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:17.413
<v Speaker 5>Make sure that it's rich it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then how do you still know what's </v>

3007
02:11:20.071 --> 02:11:23.270
<v Speaker 5>working enough to use?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you watch yourself and your,</v>

3008
02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:25.550
<v Speaker 5>you've done it so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3009
02:11:25.551 --> 02:11:27.950
<v Speaker 5>do you still know what's funny?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3010
02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:29.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

3011
02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:33.290
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we have to edit on videos,</v>

3012
02:11:33.291 --> 02:11:34.124
<v Speaker 5>we'll watch it so many times that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just feel like we don't even know </v>

3013
02:11:37.101 --> 02:11:37.934
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the difference is he's got an </v>

3014
02:11:38.951 --> 02:11:40.070
<v Speaker 5>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

3015
02:11:40.210 --> 02:11:42.080
<v Speaker 5>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's like the small,</v>

3016
02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:43.753
<v Speaker 5>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's really small things that </v>

3017
02:11:45.561 --> 02:11:49.370
<v Speaker 5>will sell a bit and you don't know why </v>
<v Speaker 5>it worked.</v>

3018
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:51.290
<v Speaker 5>And so you have to go back and watch the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tape and go,</v>

3019
02:11:51.770 --> 02:11:54.210
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did something different than that that</v>

3020
02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:55.850
<v Speaker 5>I've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you go,</v>

3021
02:11:55.851 --> 02:11:56.690
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's now,</v>

3022
02:11:56.691 --> 02:11:57.441
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you're like,</v>

3023
02:11:57.441 --> 02:11:58.274
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's in the bit.</v>

3024
02:11:58.610 --> 02:12:00.770
<v Speaker 5>Does it ever happen where you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>laughter,</v>

3025
02:12:00.771 --> 02:12:02.000
<v Speaker 5>but you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not funny.</v>

3026
02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:03.080
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh.</v>

3027
02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:04.800
<v Speaker 5>That's an interesting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3028
02:12:04.890 --> 02:12:06.830
<v Speaker 5>It's keeping in fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They like it.</v>

3029
02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:07.693
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a joke I have that I just </v>

3030
02:12:08.541 --> 02:12:10.040
<v Speaker 5>thought in this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but sounded that any special,</v>

3031
02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:12.260
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the joke is,</v>

3032
02:12:12.261 --> 02:12:13.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3033
02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:14.030
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>

3034
02:12:14.031 --> 02:12:15.800
<v Speaker 5>it's a throwaway joke that's it's kinda </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheap.</v>

3035
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:17.300
<v Speaker 5>A little bit right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A little hacky.</v>

3036
02:12:17.301 --> 02:12:18.920
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I thought it was fun joke.</v>

3037
02:12:18.921 --> 02:12:20.920
<v Speaker 5>I almost put it in this special,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3038
02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:23.330
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the joke was,</v>

3039
02:12:23.630 --> 02:12:26.510
<v Speaker 5>you know what I think is really racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't make black baby powder.</v>

3040
02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:29.990
<v Speaker 5>Like they just make white stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 5>they should make.</v>

3041
02:12:31.090 --> 02:12:31.641
<v Speaker 5>And then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3042
02:12:31.641 --> 02:12:33.350
<v Speaker 5>White Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you don't even get it.</v>

3043
02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:35.690
<v Speaker 5>Like when you get a rash and this is the</v>
<v Speaker 5>line coming up,</v>

3044
02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:37.970
<v Speaker 5>I'll go like this when the line that </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't make sense.</v>

3045
02:12:37.971 --> 02:12:39.170
<v Speaker 5>It gets a laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

3046
02:12:39.171 --> 02:12:41.810
<v Speaker 5>you get a rash and you put it on and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>just blends in.</v>

3047
02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:44.240
<v Speaker 5>But when he gets rash and a point to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>black guy go,</v>

3048
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:46.130
<v Speaker 5>he's got a ghost ride,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whip,</v>

3049
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:49.460
<v Speaker 5>it makes no fucking sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it just is a silly line.</v>

3050
02:12:49.461 --> 02:12:53.020
<v Speaker 5>And Pico I had a friend is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one should laugh at that.</v>

3051
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:54.560
<v Speaker 5>It's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>

3052
02:12:54.561 --> 02:12:56.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it gets a big old and they're like,</v>

3053
02:12:56.600 --> 02:12:59.420
<v Speaker 5>I love lines like that where the wording</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't even make sense.</v>

3054
02:12:59.421 --> 02:13:02.920
<v Speaker 5>The bureau like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3055
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:03.830
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3056
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:05.080
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I,</v>

3057
02:13:05.081 --> 02:13:08.390
<v Speaker 5>I had another joke about a black dicks </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the same joke.</v>

3058
02:13:08.391 --> 02:13:11.420
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think black is a slimming color?</v>

3059
02:13:11.630 --> 02:13:14.030
<v Speaker 5>But it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The white ones should look big like a,</v>

3060
02:13:14.210 --> 02:13:17.300
<v Speaker 5>like a lighthouse in a fog or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>flashlight in the haunted house.</v>

3061
02:13:17.301 --> 02:13:18.920
<v Speaker 5>And then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are your kids doing in here?</v>

3062
02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:20.090
<v Speaker 5>And everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3063
02:13:20.091 --> 02:13:20.924
<v Speaker 5>that's not how it last night and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>haunted house work where you kids doing </v>

3064
02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:23.390
<v Speaker 5>in hair.</v>

3065
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:24.021
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3066
02:13:24.021 --> 02:13:28.670
<v Speaker 5>I must've been thinking of Scooby Doo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I guess,</v>

3067
02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:30.110
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it works at work,</v>

3068
02:13:30.111 --> 02:13:30.944
<v Speaker 5>it's like you can't explain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't try to define what makes </v>

3069
02:13:33.061 --> 02:13:35.340
<v Speaker 5>people laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just know it works.</v>

3070
02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:38.280
<v Speaker 5>It's the life cycle is you work at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you work at and to this,</v>

3071
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:42.660
<v Speaker 5>you really refine it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the last fine way possible,</v>

3072
02:13:42.661 --> 02:13:45.780
<v Speaker 5>technical way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you just hope that Netflix is like,</v>

3073
02:13:45.810 --> 02:13:46.800
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we want it now.</v>

3074
02:13:46.801 --> 02:13:50.280
<v Speaker 5>Or do you kind of know that they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to buy it at the law at the end of</v>

3075
02:13:50.281 --> 02:13:51.480
<v Speaker 5>the life cycle?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3076
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:52.343
<v Speaker 5>we so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I think there's two ways to go </v>

3077
02:13:53.521 --> 02:13:54.520
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

3078
02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:59.100
<v Speaker 5>the situation I was in is I had the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hour,</v>

3079
02:13:59.101 --> 02:14:01.620
<v Speaker 5>I told my agents I got the hour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm ready to do it.</v>

3080
02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:03.270
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've recorded it.</v>

3081
02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:04.373
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I paid for a company to come in and </v>

3082
02:14:06.241 --> 02:14:09.720
<v Speaker 5>record it for me professionally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not professionally,</v>

3083
02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:10.890
<v Speaker 5>like drama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3084
02:14:10.890 --> 02:14:15.630
<v Speaker 5>or like the Canon seven g seven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever seventies,</v>

3085
02:14:15.930 --> 02:14:17.130
<v Speaker 5>like they shot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looked pretty.</v>

3086
02:14:17.130 --> 02:14:19.620
<v Speaker 5>I had it and I said I got it to show to </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

3087
02:14:20.070 --> 02:14:21.570
<v Speaker 5>And then there were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>

3088
02:14:21.571 --> 02:14:22.860
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're good.</v>

3089
02:14:23.010 --> 02:14:23.843
<v Speaker 5>We'll take it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

3090
02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:25.920
<v Speaker 5>we don't need to see it sight unseen by </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3091
02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:29.430
<v Speaker 5>We trust that you've you can deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then,</v>

3092
02:14:29.610 --> 02:14:32.610
<v Speaker 5>but I'd already had a place I'd already </v>
<v Speaker 5>booked to the truck to do shows.</v>

3093
02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:34.830
<v Speaker 5>I knew I was going to shoot my special </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

3094
02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:37.680
<v Speaker 5>but then I get the offer from Netflix </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you go,</v>

3095
02:14:37.681 --> 02:14:39.240
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I can pay for it the other way,</v>

3096
02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:41.760
<v Speaker 5>and this is the more interesting way and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3097
02:14:41.761 --> 02:14:42.930
<v Speaker 5>I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3098
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:44.663
<v Speaker 5>I won't say anyone's name only because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know if it's not looked down upon </v>

3099
02:14:46.891 --> 02:14:47.724
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It a lot of guys do it where they pay </v>

3100
02:14:49.471 --> 02:14:50.304
<v Speaker 5>for it out of pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They pay for their special out of </v>

3101
02:14:51.721 --> 02:14:52.554
<v Speaker 5>pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they shoot it and then they sell it to </v>

3102
02:14:53.821 --> 02:14:56.310
<v Speaker 5>Netflix and make tons of money.</v>

3103
02:14:56.790 --> 02:15:00.000
<v Speaker 5>Like I'll say a name that someone who is</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the perfect example.</v>

3104
02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:02.370
<v Speaker 5>Jo Koy went to Netflix and they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3105
02:15:02.371 --> 02:15:03.204
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't give him the number he liked or </v>

3106
02:15:05.161 --> 02:15:07.140
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Jo Koy has got money.</v>

3107
02:15:07.141 --> 02:15:10.260
<v Speaker 5>He does really always done well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a restaurant.</v>

3108
02:15:10.261 --> 02:15:11.520
<v Speaker 5>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jo was like,</v>

3109
02:15:11.521 --> 02:15:14.100
<v Speaker 5>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got it shot his own special and like a</v>

3110
02:15:14.101 --> 02:15:16.650
<v Speaker 5>fucking stadium.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like in a huge theater.</v>

3111
02:15:17.250 --> 02:15:19.980
<v Speaker 5>Then edits it gives it a Netflix because</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think?</v>

3112
02:15:19.981 --> 02:15:20.461
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3113
02:15:20.461 --> 02:15:21.294
<v Speaker 5>we want it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>

3114
02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:22.373
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you the price now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then Jo Koy sells it for like a </v>

3115
02:15:24.391 --> 02:15:25.780
<v Speaker 5>ton of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was in the,</v>

3116
02:15:26.850 --> 02:15:29.760
<v Speaker 5>it's different because some people do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that on a lower scale,</v>

3117
02:15:30.330 --> 02:15:32.130
<v Speaker 5>but with some people like Joe who got </v>
<v Speaker 5>the money,</v>

3118
02:15:32.131 --> 02:15:32.964
<v Speaker 5>they make it legit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A deliverable like were were netflix </v>

3119
02:15:35.581 --> 02:15:36.280
<v Speaker 5>wants it.</v>

3120
02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:37.113
<v Speaker 5>I was looking up that Netflix wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do mine out of pocket of their own </v>

3121
02:15:39.901 --> 02:15:42.000
<v Speaker 5>pocket and so that's how I got mine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3122
02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:43.153
<v Speaker 5>But even still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're on the list of like all the big </v>

3123
02:15:44.551 --> 02:15:45.384
<v Speaker 5>comics they have coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How important are you going to be on </v>

3124
02:15:47.341 --> 02:15:48.174
<v Speaker 5>that list?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to hope that they watch it and </v>

3125
02:15:49.651 --> 02:15:50.450
<v Speaker 5>they like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3126
02:15:50.450 --> 02:15:50.990
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3127
02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:51.890
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're pre,</v>

3128
02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:54.180
<v Speaker 5>is this your first special?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was on Netflix.</v>

3129
02:15:54.181 --> 02:15:54.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

3130
02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:57.270
<v Speaker 5>that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they liked it so much.</v>

3131
02:15:57.271 --> 02:15:59.190
<v Speaker 5>They bought my second wife earlier </v>
<v Speaker 5>special.</v>

3132
02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:01.740
<v Speaker 5>Then the machine there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was one about time,</v>

3133
02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:05.250
<v Speaker 5>they're like doing a by that and I owned</v>
<v Speaker 5>it a by that,</v>

3134
02:16:05.290 --> 02:16:06.123
<v Speaker 5>I mean we'll put that on too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this will air for like three months </v>

3135
02:16:08.251 --> 02:16:09.710
<v Speaker 5>and then that or for like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3136
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:11.760
<v Speaker 5>And then there'll be on for like four </v>
<v Speaker 5>years I think.</v>

3137
02:16:11.820 --> 02:16:13.540
<v Speaker 5>So the machine is on Netflix right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to,</v>

3138
02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:16.320
<v Speaker 5>it should be on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll be on after this airs for a little</v>

3139
02:16:16.321 --> 02:16:18.180
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want this to,</v>

3140
02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:20.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of I guess get established fan base</v>

3141
02:16:20.651 --> 02:16:21.484
<v Speaker 5>and then when they put the other one on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you benefit when people watch it or </v>

3142
02:16:23.971 --> 02:16:24.804
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it just straight licensing deal of </v>

3143
02:16:25.861 --> 02:16:27.060
<v Speaker 5>strain?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They own it.</v>

3144
02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:28.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I only,</v>

3145
02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:32.830
<v Speaker 5>you don't get no benefits just from no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rating,</v>

3146
02:16:33.050 --> 02:16:35.380
<v Speaker 5>like if they see that it does really </v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

3147
02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:36.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I get the right,</v>

3148
02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:38.890
<v Speaker 5>they owed it for like four,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe four.</v>

3149
02:16:38.891 --> 02:16:40.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that I buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the answer to that.</v>

3150
02:16:40.521 --> 02:16:42.370
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think I owed for like four years.</v>

3151
02:16:42.530 --> 02:16:44.140
<v Speaker 5>And then at the end of four years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can either,</v>

3152
02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:45.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give me like a real,</v>

3153
02:16:45.930 --> 02:16:46.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean real small.</v>

3154
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:48.980
<v Speaker 5>It's a benefit to have it on Netflix as </v>
<v Speaker 5>a fair.</v>

3155
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.080
<v Speaker 5>Have it in your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3156
02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:54.390
<v Speaker 5>Like I think Tom's first special went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ran out in four years and I thought,</v>

3157
02:16:54.391 --> 02:16:55.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3158
02:16:56.110 --> 02:16:58.150
<v Speaker 5>you could have a back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Tom was like,</v>

3159
02:16:58.180 --> 02:17:00.130
<v Speaker 5>or you can just keep it up that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>

3160
02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:01.790
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're good.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The fault doesn't have experience doing </v>

02:25:11.251 --> 02:25:12.084

<v Speaker 2>We have a tesla,</v>

3531
02:32:16.430 --> 02:32:17.263

<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They had to say that.</v>

3534
02:32:22.090 --> 02:32:25.090
<v Speaker 2>But the navigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't use google maps so it doesn't</v>

3535
02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:28.120
<v Speaker 2>have traffic updates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3536
02:32:28.470 --> 02:32:29.303
<v Speaker 2>And part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we driving up the one which for </v>

3537
02:32:31.691 --> 02:32:34.420
<v Speaker 2>anyone that isn't familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a road that goes all the way up the</v>

3538
02:32:34.421 --> 02:32:35.800
<v Speaker 2>coast of California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

3539
02:32:35.860 --> 02:32:38.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a point from like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3540
02:32:38.530 --> 02:32:41.470
<v Speaker 2>the center of California up to Santa </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cruz,</v>

3541
02:32:41.471 --> 02:32:44.110
<v Speaker 2>which is about two hours in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains.</v>

3542
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:47.110
<v Speaker 2>No reception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's basically,</v>

3543
02:32:47.111 --> 02:32:49.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a really beautiful nature drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

3544
02:32:49.930 --> 02:32:50.763
<v Speaker 2>there's one road and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so were the navigation is taking up </v>

3545
02:32:54.250 --> 02:32:58.630
<v Speaker 2>up this road and about halfway up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just one lady sitting there in a</v>

3546
02:32:58.631 --> 02:33:01.090
<v Speaker 2>lawn chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One lady in the middle of the road,</v>

3547
02:33:01.091 --> 02:33:01.924
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3548
02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:04.990
<v Speaker 2>you got to turn around the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fell into the ocean.</v>

3549
02:33:05.410 --> 02:33:06.243
<v Speaker 2>You can't drive this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And apparently the road has been closed </v>

3550
02:33:08.951 --> 02:33:13.540
<v Speaker 2>for a long fucking time and the Tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is run powered by battery.</v>

3551
02:33:13.570 --> 02:33:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no fuck.</v>

3552
02:33:15.490 --> 02:33:16.390
<v Speaker 2>You can't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3553
02:33:16.391 --> 02:33:17.650
<v Speaker 2>do you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I get a little gap?</v>

3554
02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:22.990
<v Speaker 2>You've got a battery and thankfully we </v>
<v Speaker 2>charged right before going up the one,</v>

3555
02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:25.330
<v Speaker 2>but like if we went up there and didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>charge,</v>

3556
02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:27.380
<v Speaker 2>it would have been in there in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

3557
02:33:28.130 --> 02:33:28.963
<v Speaker 3>we had to drive back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time we got back it was empty </v>

3558
02:33:30.801 --> 02:33:32.240
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you've got to charge it.</v>

3559
02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Lucky that we charged the right before </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's no reception,</v>

3560
02:33:36.940 --> 02:33:38.260
<v Speaker 2>no fucking gas.</v>

3561

<v Speaker 3>you have to get your car towed.</v>

3563
02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:42.880
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your Tesla was like a,</v>

3564
02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:46.300
<v Speaker 3>like a teenage boy with his head sets on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seventh house fire.</v>

3565
02:33:51.140 --> 02:33:51.973
<v Speaker 2>This scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this one lady sitting in a </v>

3566
02:33:55.251 --> 02:33:57.080
<v Speaker 2>lawn chair in the middle of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>nowhere</v>

3567
02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:01.360
<v Speaker 3>world fell into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3568
02:34:01.410 --> 02:34:02.243
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3569
02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:04.330

3570
02:34:04.331 --> 02:34:06.340
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing would happen with gas,</v>

3571
02:34:06.341 --> 02:34:07.174
<v Speaker 3>but there's no gas stations around you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could like siphon some off or </v>

3572
02:34:10.241 --> 02:34:12.790
<v Speaker 3>you could wait for someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What can come.</v>

3573
02:34:12.940 --> 02:34:13.773
<v Speaker 3>I guess someone could just bring you </v>
<v Speaker 3>ring up gas as opposed to just like an </v>

3574
02:34:15.850 --> 02:34:18.220
<v Speaker 3>external charger for your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plug it into your car.</v>

3575
02:34:18.221 --> 02:34:22.270

3579
02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:32.793
<v Speaker 3>I think that's when you start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just jump because you take the </v>

3580
02:34:35.141 --> 02:34:37.000
<v Speaker 3>insulation out of it and you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>building a fire.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Total survival mode and less driving by </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>
