34
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from the top,</v>

35
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Shane and jake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane Dawson is the king of Youtube.</v>

36
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These past couple of these were kind of </v>

37
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 2>the king of Youtube for like a past year</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something,</v>

38
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 2>but these whole documentary series have </v>
<v Speaker 2>just been over the,</v>

39
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.420
<v Speaker 2>over the top like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you pull up his channel?</v>

40
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you the views that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>got there,</v>

41
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.413
<v Speaker 2>but right now he has just come out with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Jake Paul documentary called inside </v>

42
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:22.914
<v Speaker 2>the mind of Jake Paul when he tries to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand really what's going on with </v>

43
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm intrigued.</v>

44
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see here.</v>

45
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at look at all of his recent</v>
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>

46
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 2>What does that look?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So low quality,</v>

47
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 2>is that just part of the thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 million.</v>

48
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Fourteen million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>

49
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 2>$24 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is just.</v>

50
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 2>This is average stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 2>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like new level shit.</v>

52
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.493
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his new documentary about Jake pauls </v>

53
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:52.694
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

54
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 2>I loved this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

55
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Jake's response to part one was number </v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

56
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.053
<v Speaker 3>trending with two point 2 million views </v>
<v Speaker 3>in two days and Shane's video with 10 </v>

57
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 3>million views in one day wasn't on </v>
<v Speaker 3>trending.</v>

58
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember a damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the hell?</v>

59
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.563
<v Speaker 3>What's the logic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you trend Jake Paul's response </v>

60
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:18.510
<v Speaker 3>video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

61
00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just fix the trending page and it's</v>

62
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 3>like it's just not a trending page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it is curated,</v>

63
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 3>why did they keep trending?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jake Paul,</v>

64
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 3>if there's really no good explanation </v>
<v Speaker 3>for why this would be there and not that</v>

65
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it literally is counter intuitive.</v>

66
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 3>That response isn't what's trending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the topic itself,</v>

67
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.200
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's maddening.</v>

68
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.330
<v Speaker 3>But regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's mine.</v>

69
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.683
<v Speaker 3>The crunch of it is that he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see if Jake Paul's a sociopath and I </v>

70
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 3>personally don't think that Jake Paul's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a sociopath.</v>

71
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.364
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a tall claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it takes this twist where he's </v>

72
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe he's a brother.</v>

73
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Logan is the sociopath and it's about </v>
<v Speaker 3>him living in the shadow of his brother,</v>

74
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 3>which is a really interesting twist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely can see that.</v>

75
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 3>I could see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

76
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:14.464
<v Speaker 3>I can see that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I am looking forward to seeing how </v>

77
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 3>this series unveils.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was,</v>

78
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.003
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Logan was blindsided by the </v>

79
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 3>whole thing because jake and his video </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

80
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was about sociopathy and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

81
00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a sociopath so come make this </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary about me.</v>

82
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be good pr for me.</v>

83
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:32.524
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Logan I think was blindsided that he </v>

84
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:36.784
<v Speaker 3>was all the sudden coming under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnifying lens and he just tweeted out </v>

85
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 3>this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this I really didn't want to,</v>

86
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:45.500
<v Speaker 3>but I feel compelled to give my thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Shane series this far.</v>

87
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 3>And then Shane actually responded a </v>
<v Speaker 3>surprise extended finale.</v>

88
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Which is a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

89
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Don't give a fuck he's ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

90
00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 3>the really intriguing thing for me and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>am,</v>

91
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm intrigued.</v>

92
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

93
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm glued to the set here affect Shane </v>
<v Speaker 3>has given a lot of youtubers hope,</v>

94
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:12.400
<v Speaker 3>kind of always channel and just turn the</v>
<v Speaker 3>second round.</v>

95
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.950
<v Speaker 3>Well for a long time he was a guy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just taste tested fast food.</v>

96
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For so long.</v>

97
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he was doing before </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

98
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Those probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did like sketches and she said,</v>

99
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.131
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not.</v>

100
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:28.880
<v Speaker 3>He has two channels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been kind of like,</v>

101
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 3>been around forever and doing all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 3>of different content,</v>

102
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 3>but he was just eating food for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

103
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.643
<v Speaker 3>but he likes this lugged through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>found his voice and he really has got </v>

104
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 3>this second wind that's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really cool.</v>

105
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 3>I really liked the style of the document</v>
<v Speaker 3>date.</v>

106
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 3>If it's fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really well edited.</v>

107
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno who's editing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure Shane is probably sitting there</v>

108
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 3>a lot with the editor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the editing.</v>

109
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.910
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

110
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.150
<v Speaker 3>he wears the same shirt in every video I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think.</v>

111
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's the same shirt,</v>

112
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 3>but either that or he's like doug funny </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's got like,</v>

113
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've ever done,</v>

114
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.313
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he dug high net worth doing the same </v>

115
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.653
<v Speaker 3>outfit every day and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's an episode where he </v>

116
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 3>walks in the closet and he just has like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same outfit.</v>

117

<v Speaker 3>God bless his soul.</v>

120
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 3>But there was one moment here that </v>
<v Speaker 3>really broke my heart.</v>

121
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.300
<v Speaker 3>There was a moment in the new episode </v>
<v Speaker 3>that really broke my heart as a fan,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want to say colleague,</v>

123
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 3>but maybe an associate you could say as </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's had him here,</v>

124
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 3>a guest on our podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really broke my heart.</v>

<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

126
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 4>I do also remember like Jake Paul was on</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

127
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.503
<v Speaker 3>See if you notice anything here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of missed the timestamp for </v>

<v Speaker 3>I just thought it was a funny </v>

154
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.870
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to do my well traveled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well seasoned that Godfather but not one</v>

155
00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:45.490
<v Speaker 3>in the pocket for a while here at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>office.</v>

156
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm working on that.</v>

157
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.680
<v Speaker 3>My godfather accent for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So did you change your mind?</v>

158
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:53.410
<v Speaker 3>But Jake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul or thing would know,</v>

159
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.203
<v Speaker 3>I never thought I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of always suspected that jake </v>

160
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.500
<v Speaker 3>deep down isn't a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

161
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 3>I had that impression when I sat here </v>
<v Speaker 3>with him,</v>

162
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

163
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 3>because I had a conversation with him </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside off camera and I was like,</v>

164
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:15.570
<v Speaker 3>do tell me straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were walking to the bathroom together</v>

165
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:16.404
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was during their heyday when </v>

166
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:24.531
<v Speaker 3>they were really competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like telling you how are you guys?</v>

167
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Because it seems really toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's.</v>

168
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

169
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 3>it's really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We honestly really hate each other.</v>

170
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 3>He told me that in complete earnestness </v>
<v Speaker 3>off camera and the hallway.</v>

171
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really bad.</v>

172
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:38.334
<v Speaker 3>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell that the competitive it's </v>

173
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:49.310
<v Speaker 3>mentalities real well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently Logan actually really fucked.</v>

174
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:55.491
<v Speaker 3>Did Jake's ex girlfriend like for real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then made like a distrac about it.</v>

175
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.260
<v Speaker 3>But Jack was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

176
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.103
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

177
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.630
<v Speaker 3>act like I know that's like good for </v>
<v Speaker 3>views,</v>

178
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:02.850
<v Speaker 3>but that actually really hurts my </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings.</v>

179
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these guys are fucking twisted.</v>

180
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 3>But apparently jake actually gets into a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of this stuff.</v>

181
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 3>So I'm looking forward to that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>some of the anecdotes that came out of </v>

244
00:13:46.261 --> 00:13:47.094
<v Speaker 2>those phone conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a phone call with his wife Cosby </v>

245
00:13:52.471 --> 00:13:56.700
<v Speaker 2>recounted that a hot dog bun was thrown </v>
<v Speaker 2>at his face,</v>

246
00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.373
<v Speaker 2>a cosby who was legally blind city fell </v>
<v Speaker 2>down a flight of stairs because he </v>

247
00:14:03.031 --> 00:14:05.370
<v Speaker 2>wasn't being guided and was without his </v>
<v Speaker 2>cane,</v>

248
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.563
<v Speaker 2>which was apparently taken away along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his shoe laces by correctional </v>

249
00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:12.900
<v Speaker 2>officers over fears that he might harm </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

250
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.813
<v Speaker 2>Cosby told his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbed the check book and hire anyone </v>

251
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:22.000

<v Speaker 2>soon as possible.</v>

252
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.710
<v Speaker 2>This mother fucker's worth $400,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million bucks.</v>

253
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.960
<v Speaker 2>And that money can not save him.</v>

<v Speaker 2>His face is like dead pan.</v>

298
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.870
<v Speaker 2>He's sinister sounding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he continues.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

304
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.620
<v Speaker 2>and you almost feel like she's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>creeped out,</v>

305
00:17:32.621 --> 00:17:34.300
<v Speaker 2>but I believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

306
00:17:34.301 --> 00:17:35.081
<v Speaker 2>stop it.</v>

310
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.440

<v Speaker 2>and then at the end of the clip,</v>

311
00:17:41.441 --> 00:17:42.274
<v Speaker 2>the kids are eating the barbecue and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes and takes it away from them real </v>

312
00:17:44.951 --> 00:17:48.430
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Implying that it is not a joke.</v>

313
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.740
<v Speaker 2>And so here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>

317
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.223

<v Speaker 2>This is definitely anecdotal from his </v>

318
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:04.530
<v Speaker 2>real life outside the show.</v>

319
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 6>Watch his face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Work things out for themselves.</v>

320
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Speaker 6>It's my barbecue sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Barbecue sauce.</v>

321
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:22.763
<v Speaker 6>Barbecue sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Haven't you ever noticed after my </v>

322
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.580
<v Speaker 6>barbecue sauce?</v>
<v Speaker 6>After awhile when it kicks in,</v>

323
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:33.590
<v Speaker 6>they get all huggy bugging.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm dead serious.</v>

324
00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 6>Haven't one of my people want to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>right home.</v>

325
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.820
<v Speaker 6>Let me do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got a cup of it up on the night table.</v>

326
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.153
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

327
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.560
<v Speaker 6>I got a cup of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>said breathing.</v>

328
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.880
<v Speaker 6>Somebody talks to his victims.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chicken to these people are going up and</v>

329
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.983
<v Speaker 6>absence is threatening her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So here's the rest of the chicken </v>

330
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:13.853
<v Speaker 6>chicken.</v>

332
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.613

<v Speaker 2>I think it was just like wacky at the </v>

333
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.620
<v Speaker 2>actual context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

334
00:19:40.621 --> 00:19:44.400
<v Speaker 2>even the context at the time is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's put a drug and the bar,</v>

335
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.293
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no other way to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't worked anything out for </v>

336
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:52.160
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all on my barbecue sauce.</v>

339
00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:59.443
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a big bucket of barbecue sauce in </v>

340
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:05.470
<v Speaker 2>the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you coming up or do I have to force?</v>

349
00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.460
<v Speaker 6>Take up the left track for themselves.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be surprised if they played </v>
<v Speaker 2>this in court during this trial.</v>

356
00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.970

594
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:45.810
<v Speaker 2>What value would you get out of texting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A 14 year old girl.</v>

595
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure how much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure.</v>

596
00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:51.763
<v Speaker 2>I can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when she goes on to describe </v>

597
00:35:55.031 --> 00:35:58.060
<v Speaker 2>their relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I not only raised one eyebrow,</v>

598
00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:59.710
<v Speaker 2>raised both my eyebrows.</v>

599
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:03.960
<v Speaker 9>At first I heard about it because I </v>
<v Speaker 9>think he invited her to a show and there</v>

600
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:06.270
<v Speaker 9>was like a picture of them together and </v>
<v Speaker 9>it was all cool.</v>

601
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:11.110
<v Speaker 9>It was clear that he is a funnel for </v>
<v Speaker 9>which who is not cool.</v>

602
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.650
<v Speaker 9>Like she seems like such a bad as on the</v>
<v Speaker 9>show.</v>

603
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And she was a fan of him so all good.</v>

604
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.290
<v Speaker 9>But then now it's like,</v>

605
00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:20.443
<v Speaker 2>well she did these interviews or she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into details of like we taxed </v>

606
00:36:24.501 --> 00:36:25.334
<v Speaker 2>and we talk and he says that I missed </v>
<v Speaker 2>you so much and I tell him I miss him </v>

607
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 2>and I imagined him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

608
00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:30.920
<v Speaker 2>him at home being like,</v>

611
00:36:37.371 --> 00:36:41.030
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I met him at a hotel and then we went</v>

612
00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:41.864
<v Speaker 2>out for dinner and then we're hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>out every night for three days and now </v>

<v Speaker 2>we text each other all the time and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>love each other and I'm just like whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 9>I feel like from perspective,</v>

649
00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 9>I</v>

650
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.920
<v Speaker 3>see why she doesn't think it's a 14 year</v>
<v Speaker 3>old girl.</v>

651
00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:40.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she thinks she's an adult,</v>

652
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that age you're like,</v>

653
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:46.240

654
00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.030

655
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:52.410
<v Speaker 3>She's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can tell she thinks she's</v>

656
00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.910
<v Speaker 9>very mature.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Fourteen year old too.</v>

657
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:59.240

<v Speaker 9>being 31.</v>

658
00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.800

<v Speaker 9>she can understand at her age how weird </v>

699
00:41:04.621 --> 00:41:05.490
<v Speaker 9>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

700
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.790
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

701
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:07.623
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

702
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:08.780
<v Speaker 2>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

703
00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can I say?</v>

704
00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:17.310
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people say he's grooming her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just such a weird state.</v>

705
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is grown.</v>

706
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:20.603
<v Speaker 3>Basically what it means is that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's preparing her or when she turns 18 </v>

707
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.690
<v Speaker 3>so that he can legally hit it.</v>

708
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

709
00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Apparently he four years of dedication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

710
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly</v>

711
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.050
<v Speaker 2>he's done that with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of 16 year old girl.</v>

712
00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Ian Was Ian's the keeper of culture and </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

713
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to get the facts mixed </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

714
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:46.730
<v Speaker 2>But allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is from a second hand report,</v>

715
00:41:46.731 --> 00:41:47.564
<v Speaker 2>but there was some sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 girl he met when she was 16 and when </v>

716
00:41:50.871 --> 00:41:53.600
<v Speaker 2>she turned 18 they started dating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

717
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly and I may maybe false.</v>

718
00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:57.914
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take everything I say here as pure fact </v>

719
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.020
<v Speaker 2>and not speculate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kiki,</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but the business owners are really.</v>

818
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:49.890
<v Speaker 3>They're just fucking dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Nathan for you in real reality.</v>

819
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is usually the companies</v>

820
00:46:53.221 --> 00:46:54.054
<v Speaker 3>have an interesting product or an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting market share or something </v>

821
00:46:56.581 --> 00:46:59.580
<v Speaker 3>like that that he can work with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the owner is always just like,</v>

822
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:01.943
<v Speaker 3>just so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's really a lot of common sense </v>

823
00:47:04.141 --> 00:47:04.711
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

824
00:47:04.711 --> 00:47:07.620
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you guys,</v>

825
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.330
<v Speaker 3>I see you profitted half a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars last year,</v>

826
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:16.890
<v Speaker 3>but somehow you still lost $300,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>in debt and the owner's like,</v>

827
00:47:16.891 --> 00:47:18.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I bought a $300,000</v>

828
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.880
<v Speaker 3>truck to help promote them or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

829
00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.250
<v Speaker 3>And that's a real one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

831
00:47:26.701 --> 00:47:27.960
<v Speaker 3>of their office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

832
00:47:27.961 --> 00:47:30.640
<v Speaker 3>well it's a half a million truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a big discount on that.</v>

833
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:33.490
<v Speaker 3>Marcus is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta sell the truck though.</v>

834
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Well I did sign up for that breakdown </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that or it's always like a,</v>

835
00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always like,</v>

836
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:43.893
<v Speaker 3>this is a really common one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes and talks to all the employees </v>

837
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:49.300
<v Speaker 3>and they're all amazing and super hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>working and they're like,</v>

838
00:47:49.301 --> 00:47:50.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's never here.</v>

839
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Speaker 3>He just ever comes here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The owner,</v>

840
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.310
<v Speaker 3>he just never comes here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not involved at all.</v>

841
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:55.511
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

842
00:47:55.511 --> 00:47:57.760
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I need you to come to work five times</v>

843
00:47:57.761 --> 00:47:58.571
<v Speaker 3>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

844
00:47:58.571 --> 00:48:01.390
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I did sign up for that.</v>

845
00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:03.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always the same dumb shit.</v>

846
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.270
<v Speaker 3>So a funny show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well anyway,</v>

847
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:15.300
<v Speaker 3>my favorite episodes is when it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>a full on mutiny and it's so juicy,</v>

848
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:22.300
<v Speaker 3>so he comes in at the request of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>owner and the owner is such a buffoon.</v>

849
00:48:22.301 --> 00:48:23.134
<v Speaker 3>He's so incompetent that he makes a pact</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the employees and they all turned </v>

850
00:48:26.801 --> 00:48:31.030
<v Speaker 3>against the owner who called him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>asked him and then he gets all defensive</v>

851
00:48:31.031 --> 00:48:35.200
<v Speaker 3>because often he'll give equity to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>employees and then it's like.</v>

852
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.700
<v Speaker 3>And then they're always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

853
00:48:36.701 --> 00:48:38.590
<v Speaker 3>you're not my boss anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suck my Dick.</v>

854
00:48:38.591 --> 00:48:39.424
<v Speaker 3>I hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually have conversations and </v>

855
00:48:42.191 --> 00:48:43.030
<v Speaker 3>it's so good.</v>

856
00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:46.870
<v Speaker 11>Or the owner will come in and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't like how you're doing this,</v>

857
00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.870
<v Speaker 11>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And then the employee who now has equity</v>

858
00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:50.571
<v Speaker 11>will say,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>

859
00:48:50.571 --> 00:48:51.404
<v Speaker 11>you're not my boss.</v>

860
00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.220
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marcus comes in and he's like,</v>

861
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:55.060
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's right.</v>

862
00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:56.980
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You suck.</v>

863
00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:59.020
<v Speaker 3>And then they always go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

864
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.863
<v Speaker 3>well I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

865
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.110
<v Speaker 3>it's my company and I'm going to run it </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I am.</v>

866
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:03.280
<v Speaker 3>And the market is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

867
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.233
<v Speaker 3>you wrote it the way you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then this business is going to be out </v>

868
00:49:06.281 --> 00:49:07.114
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be closing the doors in </v>

869
00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:10.600
<v Speaker 3>two days because you don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>run a business and it's so great.</v>

870
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.990
<v Speaker 3>So that's what's happening in Papa </v>
<v Speaker 3>John's.</v>

871
00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.570
<v Speaker 3>There's a full on a mutiny at Papa </v>
<v Speaker 3>Johns.</v>

872
00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:20.380
<v Speaker 3>He hasn't been outed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His faces off all of the branding.</v>

873
00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Remember Papa John Built this company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is fucking name right now.</v>

874
00:49:28.391 --> 00:49:33.010
<v Speaker 3>It's Steve Papa Steve's house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Welcome to Steve's house.</v>

875
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 3>So there were moving his face even at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the headquarters.</v>

876
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:38.463
<v Speaker 3>They're doing a huge makeover at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>headquarters where they're removing his </v>

877
00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:42.100
<v Speaker 3>face off the welfare check.</v>

878
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.040
<v Speaker 11>It's not worth the money they're </v>
<v Speaker 11>spending on all.</v>

879
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're betting well,</v>

880
00:49:45.521 --> 00:49:46.354
<v Speaker 3>they must be hurting again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in like full panic mode and so </v>

881
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:50.813
<v Speaker 3>they've even gone as far as to remove </v>
<v Speaker 3>the apostrophe from Papa John's Papa </v>

882
00:49:57.041 --> 00:50:02.041
<v Speaker 3>John's international filed paperwork </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the new spelling and brand imagery</v>

883
00:50:02.171 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Speaker 3>with the US patent and trademark office </v>
<v Speaker 3>in late August.</v>

884
00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.533
<v Speaker 3>Removing the possessive apostrophe and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Papa Johns would in theory provide a </v>

885
00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:12.754
<v Speaker 3>more distance between the company and </v>
<v Speaker 3>its founder so it doesn't look like he </v>

886
00:50:16.001 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 3>owns the business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the dumbest shit.</v>

887
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.153
<v Speaker 3>The funny name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's bumper John's without </v>

888
00:50:25.271 --> 00:50:26.650
<v Speaker 3>unimpressed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make sense.</v>

889
00:50:26.651 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a possessive s.</v>

890
00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.390
<v Speaker 3>his name is Papa John.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is the [inaudible] indicates the</v>

891
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.480
<v Speaker 3>basic grammar that I do know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not grammatically correct.</v>

892
00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:37.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isla is,</v>

893
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:43.750
<v Speaker 3>she's fluent in English and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>

894
00:50:43.791 --> 00:50:48.791
<v Speaker 3>the apostrophe is out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That faith is out and they have released</v>

895
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:54.521
<v Speaker 3>this heart wrenching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really powerful movement.</v>

896
00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:56.060
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you like the,</v>

897
00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look so lame.</v>

898
00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.260
<v Speaker 3>It's not down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the Papa John.</v>

899
00:51:00.261 --> 00:51:02.390
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And love by the way.</v>

900
00:51:02.391 --> 00:51:04.790
<v Speaker 3>They are also removing the better </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingredients.</v>

901
00:51:04.791 --> 00:51:09.791
<v Speaker 3>Better Pizza I read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a classic level by the way guys.</v>

902
00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:14.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not that fucking serious you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling pies.</v>

903
00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:20.110
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>save that because they made this ad that</v>

904
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:24.200
<v Speaker 3>they posted on their twitter and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a whole campaign about like a,</v>

905
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:28.370
<v Speaker 3>we're so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are so disappointed.</v>

906
00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.610
<v Speaker 3>We have to do better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like the saddest,</v>

907
00:51:31.611 --> 00:51:32.444
<v Speaker 3>most emotional shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would like to play that for you </v>

908
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.380
<v Speaker 3>now with your permission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

909

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:46.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess see,</v>

934
00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:47.573
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to know if it's from their </v>
<v Speaker 3>efforts or people are just over it and </v>

935
00:52:49.561 --> 00:52:51.540
<v Speaker 3>they want people to again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just want pizza,</v>

936
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.190
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're like,</v>

937
00:52:53.191 --> 00:52:55.760
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an apostrophe like that.</v>

938
00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:56.520
<v Speaker 3>A pause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freak,</v>

939
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.650
<v Speaker 3>genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We made a billion dollars.</v>

940
00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:00.523
<v Speaker 3>I just looked it up and I see an article</v>
<v Speaker 3>that says it was from the beginning of </v>

941
00:53:03.061 --> 00:53:05.070
<v Speaker 3>August that their sales overall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nationally,</v>

942
00:53:05.071 --> 00:53:07.790
<v Speaker 3>it was down to seven percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that.</v>

943
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:11.190
<v Speaker 3>That is significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not as much as I expected it</v>

944
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.660
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a huge difference,</v>

945
00:53:12.661 --> 00:53:15.780
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The old logo is superior.</v>

946
00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.490
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like their pizza.</v>

<v Speaker 2>pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really owning it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Just by company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I built this company with my own hands.</v>

993
00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:00.000
<v Speaker 4>I tossed the dough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made the ingredients.</v>

994
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.420
<v Speaker 4>What did I do to deserve this disrespect</v>

<v Speaker 4>He was meant to inherit this pizza.</v>

1002
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.900
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had to deal with his dad,</v>

<v Speaker 3>to do better or anything was there.</v>

1087
01:01:37.931 --> 01:01:39.490
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hit Me with the godfather music.</v>

1088
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:44.990
<v Speaker 8>I was appointed the CEO of Papa John's </v>
<v Speaker 8>earlier this year.</v>

1089
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:46.603
<v Speaker 8>As the new CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to share the values that will </v>

1090
01:01:48.741 --> 01:01:49.574
<v Speaker 8>drive the transformation of Papa John's.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I stated my career in pizza business 25 </v>

1091
01:01:54.921 --> 01:01:57.830
<v Speaker 8>years ago because pizza brings people </v>
<v Speaker 8>together.</v>

1092
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:59.503
<v Speaker 8>Unlike that piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Papa Johns who was brought the </v>

1093
01:02:02.421 --> 01:02:04.460
<v Speaker 8>foundation of everything we are to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>ground.</v>

1094
01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.660
<v Speaker 8>I found a home at Papa John's where </v>
<v Speaker 8>people from all backgrounds work side by</v>

1095
01:02:08.661 --> 01:02:12.380
<v Speaker 8>side.</v>

<v Speaker 8>fairness,</v>

1098
01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.010
<v Speaker 8>respect,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and</v>

1099
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:23.490
<v Speaker 2>are most important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ingredient is people.</v>

1100
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:24.383
<v Speaker 2>Will they have people in their pizzas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of a revelation when I </v>

1101
01:02:32.761 --> 01:02:33.594
<v Speaker 2>became CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do this in the godfather </v>

1102
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.090
<v Speaker 2>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't make sense.</v>

1103
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.793
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be too slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be when I became CEO in </v>

<v Speaker 2>A company.</v>

1380
01:17:55.990 --> 01:18:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Did you know what the Fuck God damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

1381
01:18:02.121 --> 01:18:03.070
<v Speaker 2>if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's it going,</v>

1382
01:18:03.071 --> 01:18:05.170
<v Speaker 2>boss?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a group of people that don't,</v>

1383
01:18:05.171 --> 01:18:06.004
<v Speaker 2>not for 100 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus the reasons are interesting with </v>

1384
01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:13.260
<v Speaker 2>like your perspective from Ghia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1385
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:14.103
<v Speaker 2>the no fat is a community online I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard of and I'm intrigued by their </v>

1386
01:18:17.531 --> 01:18:18.364
<v Speaker 2>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now these are people that believe that </v>

1387
01:18:20.351 --> 01:18:23.380
<v Speaker 2>by not masturbating or looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>pornography,</v>

1388
01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:29.740
<v Speaker 2>they gain superhuman powers essentially.</v>

1389
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:30.820
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pulled up,</v>

1390
01:18:30.821 --> 01:18:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I was doing some research because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of the group,</v>

1391
01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:36.510
<v Speaker 2>but this was one of the top post of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>time on the no Phipps subreddit.</v>

1392

<v Speaker 2>Confident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still rising.</v>

1415
01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.053
<v Speaker 2>One hundred 50 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Symptoms of severe pied disappear on </v>

1416
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:48.130
<v Speaker 2>prep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what it is,</v>

1417
01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:48.964
<v Speaker 2>but I liked the sound of that 200 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like every girl wants to fuck me </v>

1418
01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:57.150
<v Speaker 2>and I started reading a Bible of this as</v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I can tell isn't a job.</v>

1419
01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.550
<v Speaker 2>This guy found God after 200 days a one </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1420
01:20:03.551 --> 01:20:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know why I was watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>porn a year ago,</v>

1421
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:08.760
<v Speaker 2>two years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a amazing job and I've never been</v>

1422
01:20:08.761 --> 01:20:09.690
<v Speaker 2>happier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1423
01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 2>They'll from not masturbating 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My life has just been amazing.</v>

1424
01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:18.981
<v Speaker 2>Ever since I stopped masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 10 years.</v>

1425
01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:20.773
<v Speaker 2>This guy's dead serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of funny and a little </v>

1426
01:20:23.431 --> 01:20:27.990
<v Speaker 2>pathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm a speaking frankly,</v>

1427
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:29.453
<v Speaker 2>there is an interesting theory and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbating because I do think that </v>

1428
01:20:34.171 --> 01:20:35.004
<v Speaker 2>like porn addiction is real and I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that like when you look like </v>

1429
01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:41.490
<v Speaker 2>looking at porn is really unhealthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you do.</v>

1430
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:45.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you look at porn and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just know any finished real fast,</v>

1431
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:50.640
<v Speaker 2>it is kind of like a high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you get this like you know,</v>

1432
01:20:50.641 --> 01:20:52.170
<v Speaker 2>if you're like in a bad mood or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1433
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.080
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys I think rely on like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kurt,</v>

1434
01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.093
<v Speaker 2>a quick jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll quick porn watch as a treatment to </v>

1435
01:20:59.881 --> 01:21:00.714
<v Speaker 2>a bad mood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys or a lot of guys that </v>

1436
01:21:02.931 --> 01:21:03.764
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very common and so they'll </v>

1437
01:21:06.001 --> 01:21:08.340
<v Speaker 2>watch some porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll jerk one out real quick and then</v>

1438
01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:09.001
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1439
01:21:09.001 --> 01:21:13.200
<v Speaker 2>and then you get on with your day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is really I think something to</v>

1440
01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:14.034
<v Speaker 2>this idea that like your dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your reward levels and shit got all </v>

1441
01:21:18.031 --> 01:21:20.340
<v Speaker 2>whacked out and it really is like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction.</v>

1442
01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:21.773
<v Speaker 2>And so I do think that there is probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>some good benefits to at least not </v>

1443
01:21:26.701 --> 01:21:27.630
<v Speaker 2>looking at porn,</v>

1444
01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:30.323
<v Speaker 2>but I've also read that masturbating </v>
<v Speaker 2>daily for guys is healthy because it </v>

1445
01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:36.060
<v Speaker 2>helps prevent prostate cancer because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly,</v>

1446
01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:37.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing everything out of your tubes or </v>

1447
01:21:39.271 --> 01:21:40.104
<v Speaker 2>if you let it sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's how colon cancer happens to </v>

1448
01:21:43.171 --> 01:21:45.070
<v Speaker 2>it because you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you ship,</v>

1449
01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:48.000
<v Speaker 2>the less likely you are to get colon </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer because you don't want that stuff</v>

1450
01:21:48.001 --> 01:21:48.834
<v Speaker 2>sitting there for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same theory with the a nut </v>

1451
01:21:53.071 --> 01:21:57.870
<v Speaker 2>juice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I am intrigued,</v>

1452
01:21:57.871 --> 01:22:01.500
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time I'm sure that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not that serious.</v>

1453
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Are you gonna know fap?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in,</v>

1454
01:22:05.761 --> 01:22:07.380
<v Speaker 2>I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll know fat for like a day.</v>

1455
01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:11.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm already at five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My heartbeat feels pretty normal.</v>

1456
01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.870
<v Speaker 2>Guilt and shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

1457
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.930
<v Speaker 2>That's two to three days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't reached that level yet,</v>

1458
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:24.020
<v Speaker 2>but we all get milestones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

1459
01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:29.060
<v Speaker 2>my best record so far is three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know,</v>

1460
01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm intrigued by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to hear from a no fabric.</v>

1461
01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to take a call from somebody </v>

<v Speaker 2>masturbating to Kinda hear there,</v>

1464
01:22:41.610 --> 01:22:43.800

<v Speaker 2>I heard something interesting about Mike</v>

1465
01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Tyson when he used to go box when he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>

1466
01:22:47.941 --> 01:22:49.740
<v Speaker 2>like God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like boxer,</v>

1467
01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:50.843
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't masturbate or have sex for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like months leading up to his fight </v>

1468
01:22:54.541 --> 01:22:56.220
<v Speaker 2>because it would get them all crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Kind of interesting.</v>

1483
01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.460
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how frequently do you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbate?</v>

1484
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Probably like once a day and Zach and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1485
01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:48.250
<v Speaker 2>in a interest that he's done it twice </v>
<v Speaker 2>since the show started.</v>

1486
01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:49.150
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1488
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm genuinely curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking a sample here,</v>

1489
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I'd say about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1490
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:58.990
<v Speaker 2>once every two days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once every two days.</v>

1491
01:23:58.991 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Every two days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty conservative.</v>

1492
01:24:00.650 --> 01:24:02.050
<v Speaker 2>That's conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a young man.</v>

1493
01:24:02.051 --> 01:24:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Should be jerking off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like fight with Zach.</v>

1494
01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Just turned 21 and I want to know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much Ian masturbates.</v>

1495
01:24:08.651 --> 01:24:12.160
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he's asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He jerks like eight times a day.</v>

1496
01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:15.430
<v Speaker 2>That's a little offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1497
01:24:15.431 --> 01:24:16.960
<v Speaker 2>how am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest,</v>

1498
01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty eight hour window.</v>

1499
01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Forty eight hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty responsible.</v>

1500
01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.193
<v Speaker 2>I'm like once a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess when I was younger there'll be </v>

1501
01:24:25.511 --> 01:24:29.830
<v Speaker 2>days when I was younger there'd be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight times in a day.</v>

1502
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:32.343
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't like common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some days it's like your Dick </v>

1503
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:37.030
<v Speaker 2>actually gets hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1504
01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Whoa Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to get a life,</v>

1505
01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:41.350
<v Speaker 2>but you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we've all been there,</v>

1506
01:24:41.351 --> 01:24:42.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing better to do.</v>

1507
01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:46.173
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get why the people I get why these </v>

1508
01:24:49.161 --> 01:24:50.690
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1509
01:24:50.691 --> 01:24:51.524
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1510
01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:56.060
<v Speaker 2>intellectually I see that there can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>some benefit to it,</v>

1511
01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:57.920
<v Speaker 2>especially with what you were saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1512
01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:01.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxing your reward center and uh,</v>

1513
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:02.583
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you jerk off in the middle of </v>

1514
01:25:03.921 --> 01:25:05.480
<v Speaker 2>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can fuck your whole day up.</v>

1515
01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.670
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1516
01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Because you just get so sleepy and lazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden you're like,</v>

1517
01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:15.290
<v Speaker 2>you just have no motivation because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>jerked off in the middle of the day.</v>

1518
01:25:15.291 --> 01:25:16.124
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>

1519
01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.120
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1520
01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:18.380
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you go from there?</v>

1521
01:25:18.450 --> 01:25:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Take a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1522
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:23.590
<v Speaker 2>No fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm intrigued.</v>

1523
01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1524
01:25:25.781 --> 01:25:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Gift for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1525
01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.930
<v Speaker 2>enlightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vigorous debate.</v>

1526
01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And God bless Ya.</v>

1527
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Next up from pee Layton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work in the vape industry and I always</v>

1528
01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:39.070
<v Speaker 2>listen to your podcasts while I'm here </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a fellow member of the nation.</v>

1529
01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:43.510
<v Speaker 2>I would love to hear any commentary you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys have on the new FDA regulations for</v>

1530
01:25:43.511 --> 01:25:44.344
<v Speaker 2>vaping products in regards to packaging </v>
<v Speaker 2>and advertisings and the law to ban </v>

1531
01:25:48.461 --> 01:25:52.870
<v Speaker 2>flavors and the epidemic of teen vaping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sincerely,</v>

1532
01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:58.080
<v Speaker 2>xxx vape wizard for 20 x x x Hashtag </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] a great question.</v>

1533
01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>So the FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is</v>

1534
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.100
<v Speaker 3>actually quite interesting and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would know about this because it affects</v>

1535
01:26:07.101 --> 01:26:12.101
<v Speaker 3>you directly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the FDA is banning flavored vape</v>

1536
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.590
<v Speaker 3>juices because they say it appeals to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

1537
01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:19.933
<v Speaker 3>That is pretty much par for the course </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my pain because they did the same </v>

1538
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:23.143
<v Speaker 3>thing to alcohol and tobacco where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>really restricted how they could market </v>

1539
01:26:28.401 --> 01:26:31.310
<v Speaker 3>it because they didn't want it to appeal</v>
<v Speaker 3>to kids.</v>

1540
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:36.550
<v Speaker 3>And frankly I do feel like vaping has </v>
<v Speaker 3>become a really severe gateway drug.</v>

1541
01:26:38.931 --> 01:26:41.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you want to say gay or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1542
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:42.163
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't seen it firsthand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've heard that a lot of kids in </v>

1543
01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:46.034
<v Speaker 3>like middle school and high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walk around with these tiny little </v>

1544
01:26:47.691 --> 01:26:50.600
<v Speaker 3>vape pen and actually smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1545
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:51.643
<v Speaker 3>which I find pretty wild because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like everybody stopped smoking </v>

1546
01:26:55.701 --> 01:26:56.600
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all like,</v>

1547
01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:00.200
<v Speaker 3>we all understand it's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really bad for you.</v>

1548
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:02.263
<v Speaker 3>But now it's almost like there's a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem where super accessible and </v>

1549
01:27:05.691 --> 01:27:06.441
<v Speaker 3>everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1550
01:27:06.441 --> 01:27:08.090
<v Speaker 3>it's not as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's okay.</v>

1551
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:11.750
<v Speaker 3>I think we don't really know how bad it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is yet.</v>

1552
01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not.</v>

1553
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1554
01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:19.400
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's probably a good idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1555
01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:20.234
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1556
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:23.100
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do I know,</v>

1557
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:25.383
<v Speaker 9>Dan?</v>
<v Speaker 9>What do you think?</v>

1558
01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:27.453
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm really of two minds of it because </v>

1559
01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.570
<v Speaker 9>I'm on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1560
01:27:31.571 --> 01:27:32.404
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think,</v>

1561
01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:33.700
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>obviously it's bad.</v>

1562
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:36.550
<v Speaker 9>I don't know how prevalent it really is </v>
<v Speaker 9>with kids.</v>

1563
01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.393
<v Speaker 9>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is it more than when we were in high </v>

1564
01:27:39.401 --> 01:27:41.140
<v Speaker 9>school kids smoking cigarettes?</v>

1565
01:27:41.610 --> 01:27:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is extremely.</v>

1566
01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1567
01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:49.980
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like overwhelming from,</v>

1568
01:27:50.010 --> 01:27:50.960
<v Speaker 3>from what I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1569
01:27:50.961 --> 01:27:51.794
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not</v>

1570
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.340
<v Speaker 9>so,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean present that that is,</v>

1571
01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:58.030
<v Speaker 9>that is probably not good admittedly.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But is it,</v>

1572
01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:00.370
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>banning the flavors,</v>

1573
01:28:00.371 --> 01:28:02.290
<v Speaker 9>is that really gonna do anything to </v>
<v Speaker 9>prevent that?</v>

1574
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:05.970
<v Speaker 9>You think like it's really specific </v>
<v Speaker 9>flavors,</v>

1575
01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:10.980
<v Speaker 3>like a Unicorn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I remember when I was a kid,</v>

1576
01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.320
<v Speaker 3>I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever we come to la,</v>

1577
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:15.303
<v Speaker 3>my mom would take me to this candy store</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I loved and the one candy I would </v>

1578
01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:18.933
<v Speaker 3>always get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved it so much was bubble gum </v>

1579
01:28:21.111 --> 01:28:21.944
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you believe this and it was gum wrapped </v>

1580
01:28:24.881 --> 01:28:25.714
<v Speaker 3>in like they had a bunch of powdered </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar so you could go and it would puff </v>

1581
01:28:31.511 --> 01:28:32.860
<v Speaker 3>out sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1582
01:28:32.861 --> 01:28:33.694
<v Speaker 3>I know that it was so cool smoking a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarette and I think I forgot that </v>

1583
01:28:38.710 --> 01:28:40.570
<v Speaker 3>existed and I used to love it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1584
01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.090
<v Speaker 3>I logged it as a kid and looking back on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1585
01:28:43.091 --> 01:28:43.751
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1586
01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:47.200
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my favorite.</v>

1587
01:28:47.201 --> 01:28:49.360
<v Speaker 3>I will go get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought was so cool.</v>

1588
01:28:49.361 --> 01:28:52.210
<v Speaker 3>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are not sure.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1602
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:30.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the biggest trend.</v>

1603
01:29:30.421 --> 01:29:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever heard of a movement called</v>

1604
01:29:32.581 --> 01:29:33.414
<v Speaker 2>stop a douchebag?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a movement in Russia in which a </v>

1605
01:29:34.831 --> 01:29:38.670
<v Speaker 2>group of people stop others from parking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and illegal places such as sidewalks,</v>

1606
01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:39.504
<v Speaker 2>railroads by approaching them carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they will blow up with huge </v>

1607
01:29:42.511 --> 01:29:45.570
<v Speaker 2>amounts of ignorance and other will move</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight to physical violence.</v>

1608
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.690
<v Speaker 2>If they don't comply then they get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge sticker on their windshield.</v>

1609
01:29:48.691 --> 01:29:51.030
<v Speaker 2>They have a nice amount of subs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was wondering what you guys think.</v>

1610
01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:52.253
<v Speaker 2>Does this solution even work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is productive or should there be </v>

1611
01:29:54.721 --> 01:29:56.640
<v Speaker 2>other actions taken?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just curious.</v>

01:29:57.570 --> 01:29:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for the kind words,</v>

01:30:15.121 --> 01:30:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Stop a douchebag and actually pulled up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the video and we can watch it together.</v>

1621
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1622
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Once I have a quick look here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1623
01:30:24.691 --> 01:30:29.691
<v Speaker 2>So I mean apparently in Russia it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little more like a medieval.</v>

1624
01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Like motherfuckers just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the shit,</v>

1625
01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.770
<v Speaker 2>they're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's traffic and there's limited.</v>

1626
01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:41.250
<v Speaker 2>So just hopping up on the sidewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little more,</v>

1627
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:44.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a little more lawless probably in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some places in Russia.</v>

1628
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:49.080
<v Speaker 2>So these guys are vigilantes and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1629
01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:52.200
<v Speaker 2>this is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] cities.</v>

1630
01:30:52.201 --> 01:30:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Our sidewalk don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1631
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.280
<v Speaker 2>don't drive on the sidewalk is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

1632
01:30:56.281 --> 01:30:57.114
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they call it stop a douchebag and </v>

1633
01:30:58.981 --> 01:31:01.500
<v Speaker 2>they were taking vigilante justice into </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own hands,</v>

1634
01:31:01.501 --> 01:31:03.000
<v Speaker 2>just like Batman essentially.</v>

1635
01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:08.180
<v Speaker 8>Can I ask you why you parked your bus on</v>
<v Speaker 8>the sidewalk?</v>

1636
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:09.103
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1637
01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:12.860
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he says it's a service bus.</v>

1638
01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:16.280
<v Speaker 8>What the service bus.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can't hear you.</v>

1639
01:31:16.281 --> 01:31:17.114
<v Speaker 8>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We are waiting for some people to get </v>

1640
01:31:20.121 --> 01:31:21.140
<v Speaker 8>on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1641
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:22.123
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>could you move your bus at least you </v>

1642
01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:29.140
<v Speaker 8>parked right on the sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People push their shopping carts here.</v>

1643
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:37.910
<v Speaker 8>He doesn't seem to give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You won't be able to get around.</v>

1644
01:31:37.911 --> 01:31:42.200
<v Speaker 8>Or can you move your truck please?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you.</v>

1645
01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:44.510
<v Speaker 8>And they're asking the guy and he does </v>
<v Speaker 8>so there you have it,</v>

1646
01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:48.480
<v Speaker 8>vigilante justice,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but sometimes the</v>

1647
01:31:48.650 --> 01:31:51.250
<v Speaker 2>blurred defined and I guess that's when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets a little while.</v>

1648
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:53.703
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a Mercedes that's on the </v>

1649
01:31:56.271 --> 01:31:57.260
<v Speaker 8>sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They stop him.</v>

1650
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:59.800
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

1651
01:31:59.801 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 8>the guy</v>

1652
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.630
<v Speaker 2>says this won't happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm late.</v>

1653
01:32:01.631 --> 01:32:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1654

1655
01:32:08.501 --> 01:32:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Predator vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1656
01:32:10.421 --> 01:32:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they know these guys in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia because he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pull out.</v>

1659
01:32:16.451 --> 01:32:16.721
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1660
01:32:16.721 --> 01:32:18.220
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back up there saying you can't.</v>

1661
01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:19.083
<v Speaker 2>They're not letting them</v>

1662
01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:24.070
<v Speaker 8>pull out there making them back up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know all people are equal.</v>

1663
01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:26.170
<v Speaker 8>All must drive back.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So they send this guy back.</v>

1664
01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:29.090
<v Speaker 8>The guy knew what was good for a man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1665
01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:32.740
<v Speaker 8>let's see if this guy does.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This guy is not having that.</v>

1666
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:33.670
<v Speaker 8>I could tell you right now,</v>

1667
01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.473
<v Speaker 2>sky was kind of sheepish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like kind of on the road on the </v>

1668
01:32:37.911 --> 01:32:38.744
<v Speaker 2>sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy is fully occupying the </v>

1669
01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:43.100
<v Speaker 2>sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a huge line of traffic.</v>

1670
01:32:43.101 --> 01:32:43.960
<v Speaker 2>And this guy's driving on this</v>

1671
01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:46.800
<v Speaker 8>sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm running late,</v>

1672
01:32:46.801 --> 01:32:48.390
<v Speaker 8>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for a friend's wedding.</v>

1673
01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:50.203
<v Speaker 8>Understand,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but can you please back to the roadway </v>

1674
01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.160
<v Speaker 8>guys?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I need to be at the river.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Yada Yada.</v>

1676
01:32:56.061 --> 01:32:59.930
<v Speaker 8>At sidewalk on lake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do you relative.</v>

1677
01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.560
<v Speaker 8>You're on a footpath for the blind right</v>
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>

1678
01:33:02.730 --> 01:33:04.890
<v Speaker 8>I do understand,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but sometimes things come up.</v>

1679
01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:06.570
<v Speaker 8>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

1680
01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.510
<v Speaker 8>everyone's been really polite.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

1681
01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.561
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she went around.</v>

1682
01:33:10.561 --> 01:33:12.740
<v Speaker 8>I was just running around them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

1683
01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:14.350
<v Speaker 8>are they going to catch up to her?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So she drew.</v>

1684
01:33:14.670 --> 01:33:19.670
<v Speaker 8>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So they're chasing after she went around</v>

1685
01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:23.100
<v Speaker 8>them and book that out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so what they do,</v>

1686
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:28.050
<v Speaker 2>they have these giant stickers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably fucks their whole week up.</v>

1687
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:29.423
<v Speaker 2>And I guess what it says in Russian is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Douche bag and it's this huge </v>

1688
01:33:33.921 --> 01:33:36.360
<v Speaker 2>sticker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The covers the windshield,</v>

1689
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:38.520
<v Speaker 2>the windshield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they pretty much can't drive.</v>

1690
01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I gotta say they gave them a fair </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance.</v>

1691
01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.530
<v Speaker 2>It's very vigilante justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see how she reacts.</v>

1692
01:33:44.970 --> 01:33:48.630
<v Speaker 2>You take that thing off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God just keeps driving.</v>

1693
01:33:48.690 --> 01:33:49.523
<v Speaker 2>They put it on the passenger side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They usually put it over the driver's </v>

1694
01:33:51.181 --> 01:33:51.990
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1695
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.823
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>

1696
01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:01.740
<v Speaker 8>we've got another one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

1697
01:34:03.961 --> 01:34:05.560
<v Speaker 8>there's two.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's several cars.</v>

1698
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:08.660
<v Speaker 8>That whole line.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The day stop a douchebag.</v>

1699
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:10.260
<v Speaker 8>Boom in here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just as himself.</v>

1700
01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:14.940
<v Speaker 8>Could you back out of your car please?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And there's actually a car behind him.</v>

1701
01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:16.753
<v Speaker 8>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Or I'll put a sticker on your </v>

1702
01:34:17.161 --> 01:34:18.270
<v Speaker 8>windshield.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 8>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's pulling.</v>

1704
01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.660
<v Speaker 8>He's driving into them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Trying to run them over.</v>

1705
01:34:21.661 --> 01:34:22.494
<v Speaker 8>It.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Stopped there saying I'm going to put a </v>

1706
01:34:23.371 --> 01:34:26.670
<v Speaker 8>sticker on your windshield.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to give you fucker stickier.</v>

1707
01:34:26.671 --> 01:34:29.130
<v Speaker 8>Now they put it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So</v>

<v Speaker 2>passenger side window.</v>

1712
01:34:38.421 --> 01:34:39.254
<v Speaker 2>So there's really no way for him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive until he gets off on the driver's </v>

1713
01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:45.460
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The driver's side.</v>

01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:48.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know much about Russia.</v>

1737
01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Even regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't the Mafia.</v>

1738
01:35:51.311 --> 01:35:53.860
<v Speaker 3>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never know this guy could have a gun</v>

1739
01:35:53.861 --> 01:35:57.340
<v Speaker 3>in just or nunchuck in this case they </v>
<v Speaker 3>stood their ground man.</v>

1740
01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.810
<v Speaker 3>And these are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are brave kids.</v>

1741
01:35:58.811 --> 01:36:01.930
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a brave kids doing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>valuable public service.</v>

1742
01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:02.793
<v Speaker 3>That's my take from this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the sticker is a pretty </v>

1743
01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:10.390
<v Speaker 3>innocent but strong way of being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

1744
01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:12.720
<v Speaker 3>And they also give every they to take it</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

1745
01:36:12.730 --> 01:36:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Don't goof off the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I like about them,</v>

1746
01:36:17.621 --> 01:36:19.660
<v Speaker 3>if they don't immediately throw the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sticker on,</v>

1747
01:36:19.661 --> 01:36:20.494
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1748
01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:23.920
<v Speaker 3>we're here to keep peace on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sidewalk.</v>

1749
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Can you please back up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they do,</v>

1750
01:36:26.141 --> 01:36:30.340
<v Speaker 3>they don't fuck with their car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think these guys have struck a good</v>

1751
01:36:30.341 --> 01:36:32.080
<v Speaker 3>balance of vigilante justice here.</v>

1752
01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:39.210
<v Speaker 8>Saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>

1753
01:36:39.211 --> 01:36:40.044
<v Speaker 8>that guy is so fun to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 8>His whole view was obstructed and he </v>

1754
01:36:44.010 --> 01:36:47.850
<v Speaker 8>continues to try to drive forward </v>
<v Speaker 8>getting more stickers.</v>

1755
01:36:47.851 --> 01:36:48.684
<v Speaker 8>So he continues to try to drive more and</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're putting more stickers on his </v>

1756
01:36:52.441 --> 01:36:56.310
<v Speaker 8>windshield and they're actually laying </v>
<v Speaker 8>on the front of the car.</v>

1757
01:36:57.230 --> 01:36:58.620
<v Speaker 8>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This guy's having a fucked up day.</v>

1758
01:36:58.621 --> 01:36:59.550
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's someone else in the car.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I spit on everyone.</v>

1783
01:37:59.971 --> 01:38:02.730

<v Speaker 2>Stop a Douche bag.</v>

1784

<v Speaker 2>valued publix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really cool.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you to Josh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>favorite channel on Youtube.</v>

1790
01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:28.180
<v Speaker 2>So shout out to Josh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Matt Duncan's one that we.</v>

1791
01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sure what.</v>

1792
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.611
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

1793
01:38:32.611 --> 01:38:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt says,</v>

1794
01:38:36.250 --> 01:38:37.083
<v Speaker 2>there was another bathroom habit I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I realized was normal seven years </v>

1795
01:38:39.271 --> 01:38:40.104
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to members of my tennis </v>

1796
01:38:42.601 --> 01:38:47.460
<v Speaker 2>team in my freshman year of college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I used a Urinal or went pee,</v>

1797
01:38:47.461 --> 01:38:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I would always whip out my balls along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my penis to peep.</v>

1798
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.333
<v Speaker 2>I would pull the waistband under my </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls and that always felt more </v>

1799
01:38:56.761 --> 01:38:59.790
<v Speaker 2>comfortable and natural and when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought it up to my teammates,</v>

1800
01:38:59.791 --> 01:39:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I realized I was the only one that did </v>
<v Speaker 2>that among the team.</v>

1801
01:39:03.090 --> 01:39:03.923
<v Speaker 2>I was so embarrassed and I have since </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed my habits and I do not whip out </v>

1802
01:39:07.351 --> 01:39:09.360
<v Speaker 2>my balls anymore to pee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I miss it.</v>

1803
01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:10.763
<v Speaker 2>Is this normal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you whip out your balls to p or just </v>

1804
01:39:12.751 --> 01:39:14.340
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your Rod as well?</v>

1805
01:39:14.370 --> 01:39:15.420
<v Speaker 2>I would love your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1806
01:39:15.421 --> 01:39:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy that you brought this to me</v>

1807
01:39:20.191 --> 01:39:25.191
<v Speaker 2>because I feel like here at the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're smashing taboos.</v>

1808
01:39:26.290 --> 01:39:27.123
<v Speaker 2>We are bringing things out to light that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't talk about and we are </v>

1809
01:39:29.911 --> 01:39:34.911
<v Speaker 2>normalizing behaviors that are normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and good and just now before I get it,</v>

1810
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.170
<v Speaker 2>now before I get into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I want to say that we've converted a</v>

1811
01:39:40.171 --> 01:39:41.004
<v Speaker 2>lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have been shamed to </v>

1812
01:39:42.721 --> 01:39:44.880
<v Speaker 2>wiping their ass from the back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is clownish.</v>

1813
01:39:44.881 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not convenient.</v>

1814
01:39:46.351 --> 01:39:47.184
<v Speaker 2>It's not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have taken the time at </v>

1815
01:39:49.711 --> 01:39:50.544
<v Speaker 2>home to sit and cut their balls and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pianists in their hand and to scoop </v>

1816
01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:55.553
<v Speaker 2>under while sitting comfortably with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other hand and they found that that's a </v>

1817
01:39:59.450 --> 01:40:00.750
<v Speaker 2>superior method.</v>

1818
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to tell you right now that</v>

1819
01:40:03.721 --> 01:40:04.554
<v Speaker 2>the front way is superior even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be a fucking cave man to </v>

1820
01:40:06.961 --> 01:40:07.794
<v Speaker 2>stand up and squat and reach behind your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass and wipe side decided to clean your </v>

1821
01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.970
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to tell you that.</v>

1822
01:40:11.971 --> 01:40:14.010
<v Speaker 2>I think once we pick out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just.</v>

1823
01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:14.873
<v Speaker 2>What I am saying is that I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that US front wipers need to be </v>

1824
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:19.583
<v Speaker 2>ostracized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we need to be outcast and </v>

1825
01:40:21.871 --> 01:40:24.720
<v Speaker 2>demean because we approach problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

1826
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Now I come to this issue of whipping the</v>
<v Speaker 2>balls out.</v>

1827
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sweet young man,</v>

1828
01:40:29.551 --> 01:40:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Matt was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

1829
01:40:32.101 --> 01:40:34.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1830
01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:37.380
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was ridiculed by his teammates.</v>

1831
01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you,</v>

1832
01:40:38.941 --> 01:40:39.774
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always take my balls out fucking </v>

1833
01:40:42.481 --> 01:40:44.970
<v Speaker 2>proudly and you know why you take your </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls out and Matt,</v>

1834
01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:48.210
<v Speaker 2>because you're smart and you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what makes sense?</v>

1835
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:49.763
<v Speaker 2>Now if you just take your dick out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got nothing to rest your pants </v>

1836
01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:54.490
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're probably like me.</v>

1837
01:40:54.491 --> 01:40:57.790
<v Speaker 2>You use a waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works with the elastic waist.</v>

1838
01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:01.660
<v Speaker 2>If you're wearing an elastic waist pants</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I often do,</v>

1839
01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:06.460
<v Speaker 2>you put the waste under your balls </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you just take your dick out,</v>

1840
01:41:06.610 --> 01:41:10.210
<v Speaker 2>you have to hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks ridiculous.</v>

1841
01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:13.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like a little tick tack peeking </v>
<v Speaker 2>over a fucking Mole Hill.</v>

1842
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:17.380
<v Speaker 2>You need to take the balls out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to let it all breathe and that's</v>

1843
01:41:17.381 --> 01:41:19.750
<v Speaker 2>an important thing and I personally find</v>
<v Speaker 2>it superior.</v>

1844
01:41:19.930 --> 01:41:20.321
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

1845
01:41:20.321 --> 01:41:24.450
<v Speaker 2>don't let people tell you that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not that.</v>

1846
01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:25.293
<v Speaker 2>That's not the right way to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's just the absolute </v>

1847
01:41:27.130 --> 01:41:27.963
<v Speaker 2>outright disgusting criminal conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Live to deep state line when I won't </v>

1848
01:41:32.201 --> 01:41:35.920
<v Speaker 2>stand for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take your balls out along with your Dick</v>

01:41:35.921 --> 01:41:36.950
<v Speaker 2>and now everyone is homes.</v>

1850
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:37.840

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

01:41:44.681 --> 01:41:49.681
<v Speaker 2>Do you take your balls out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what it kind of depends on,</v>

1855
01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:52.810
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you're wearing.</v>

1856
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:56.310
<v Speaker 2>It's situational highly situations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the others,</v>

1857
01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:00.293

<v Speaker 2>you really have no option if you wear </v>

1858

<v Speaker 2>jeans shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're wearing like a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Thank you [inaudible].</v>

1874
01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.073
<v Speaker 2>Love to hear that and that through you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found a ton of other creators and </v>

1875
01:42:57.131 --> 01:42:58.960
<v Speaker 2>content that I would never have all my </v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

1876
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.823
<v Speaker 2>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see Ethan kind of a personal </v>

1877
01:43:00.971 --> 01:43:01.804
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you capable of confirming and </v>

1878
01:43:03.611 --> 01:43:04.990
<v Speaker 2>admitting you were depressed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1879
01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I want to answer this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like it's an awful way to end</v>

1880
01:43:09.761 --> 01:43:12.910
<v Speaker 2>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just having a good time with the</v>

1881
01:43:12.911 --> 01:43:15.370
<v Speaker 2>balls out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can do it next time.</v>

1882
01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say that for next time.</v>

1883
01:43:16.661 --> 01:43:18.910
<v Speaker 2>I do want to answer this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says I'll just finish.</v>

1884
01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:20.313
<v Speaker 2>Currently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of a social stigma at my </v>

1885
01:43:21.311 --> 01:43:22.144
<v Speaker 2>university that depression is a choice </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a sign of weakness and I know that </v>

1886
01:43:25.091 --> 01:43:25.924
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you detect this and how are you </v>

1887
01:43:27.761 --> 01:43:30.820
<v Speaker 2>dealing with it currently if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel comfortable answering?</v>

1888
01:43:30.821 --> 01:43:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Well I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll answer it.</v>

1889
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:35.770
<v Speaker 2>I think I can answer it without being </v>
<v Speaker 2>like super depressing.</v>

1890
01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:39.130
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in college there was a really</v>

1891
01:43:39.131 --> 01:43:39.964
<v Speaker 2>big stigma about being depressed and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure I was depressed at the time and I </v>

1892
01:43:44.411 --> 01:43:47.320
<v Speaker 2>think it's really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's changed,</v>

1893
01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:48.154
<v Speaker 2>but it's really fucked up because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember at my college dorm there was a </v>

1894
01:43:51.771 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 2>sign</v>

1895
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:57.130
<v Speaker 3>on the wall with like Prozac and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of insinuation that like,</v>

1896
01:43:57.900 --> 01:44:00.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take it your week or something or</v>

1897
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:01.633
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the subtext because it was </v>

1898
01:44:02.541 --> 01:44:07.541
<v Speaker 3>really like a how fucked up is society </v>
<v Speaker 3>that everybody's taking Prozac.</v>

1899
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:10.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then sinuation is like,</v>

1900
01:44:10.161 --> 01:44:11.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need that shit.</v>

1901
01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:15.810
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't on anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1902
01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.300
<v Speaker 3>I agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that and I was like,</v>

1903
01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's on drugs,</v>

1904
01:44:19.610 --> 01:44:21.670
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1905
01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.120
<v Speaker 3>the idea of treating depression was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like a.</v>

1906
01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:28.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very stigma.</v>

1907
01:44:28.970 --> 01:44:31.390
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said in the uptivity,</v>

1908
01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:35.000
<v Speaker 3>it's not sexy to be depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's pathetic.</v>

1909
01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Just sounds pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's two kinds of price.</v>

1910
01:44:37.410 --> 01:44:40.790
<v Speaker 3>They're like everyone is depressed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's like the real,</v>

1911
01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:45.940
<v Speaker 3>the real depressed in his treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe people just like combine it.</v>

1912
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:49.010
<v Speaker 3>The people who.</v>

1913
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the people who,</v>

1914
01:44:52.730 --> 01:44:53.563
<v Speaker 3>everyone gets depressed sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people who get depressed sometimes </v>

1915
01:44:57.231 --> 01:45:00.770
<v Speaker 3>don't understand what it's like to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed for two years.</v>

1916
01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:03.920
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I think there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>disconnect there.</v>

1917
01:45:03.921 --> 01:45:04.700
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1918
01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:07.410
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a disconnect.</v>

1919
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:11.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a misunderstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But be that as it may,</v>

1920
01:45:12.530 --> 01:45:14.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I've been depressed for a really</v>

1921
01:45:14.451 --> 01:45:15.284
<v Speaker 3>long time and I remember I always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always knew that I had really severe </v>

1922
01:45:19.431 --> 01:45:20.264
<v Speaker 3>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was diagnosed with generalized </v>

1923
01:45:21.711 --> 01:45:24.740
<v Speaker 3>anxiety disorder when I went off to </v>
<v Speaker 3>college and it was like really crippling</v>

1924
01:45:24.741 --> 01:45:28.670
<v Speaker 3>all throughout college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had accepted that I had a problem.</v>

1925
01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:32.480
<v Speaker 3>But I remember the first time when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were living in Israel,</v>

1926
01:45:32.481 --> 01:45:33.890
<v Speaker 3>I saw a psychiatrist.</v>

1927
01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:36.150
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1928
01:45:36.150 --> 01:45:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of my anxiety was really bad,</v>

1929
01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:42.453
<v Speaker 3>or maybe I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was having some kind of weird thing </v>

1930
01:45:44.021 --> 01:45:47.980
<v Speaker 3>and I just wanted to talk to a therapist</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had said,</v>

1931
01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:48.821
<v Speaker 3>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1932
01:45:48.821 --> 01:45:51.790
<v Speaker 3>it was a therapist and I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about my symptoms and I was like,</v>

1933
01:45:52.450 --> 01:45:54.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm anxious and I,</v>

1934
01:45:54.271 --> 01:45:56.920
<v Speaker 3>there's this one thing that I get all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time that I still get,</v>

1935
01:45:57.430 --> 01:46:01.540
<v Speaker 3>which is that I get like foggy brain and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like not myself.</v>

1936
01:46:01.541 --> 01:46:05.050
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm having a bad high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1937
01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:07.810
<v Speaker 3>I really hate that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So awful.</v>

1938
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:10.300
<v Speaker 3>And then the therapist was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1939
01:46:10.301 --> 01:46:11.350
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1940
01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:15.430
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like you have depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that shocked me.</v>

1941
01:46:15.431 --> 01:46:17.530
<v Speaker 3>I was almost offended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1942
01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:18.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1943
01:46:18.430 --> 01:46:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I have anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not depression.</v>

1944
01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:23.560
<v Speaker 3>I was actually genuinely defensive and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1945
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:24.520
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck,</v>

1946
01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:25.600
<v Speaker 3>like fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have,</v>

1947
01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:27.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have anxiety.</v>

1948
01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:31.990
<v Speaker 3>And my reaction was very much like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1949
01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:35.970
<v Speaker 3>fuck you dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1950
01:46:35.971 --> 01:46:36.804
<v Speaker 3>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that must've been like seven years ago </v>

1951
01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:42.513
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was when we were living in Ramat Gan </v>

1952
01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:48.720
<v Speaker 3>gun and I've never treated it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything like,</v>

1953
01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:53.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1954
01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:57.800
<v Speaker 3>I've been like desperate enough where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1955
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:59.000
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need some fucking help.</v>

1956
01:46:59.001 --> 01:47:01.810
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why I want to talk to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and I'm,</v>

1957
01:47:03.810 --> 01:47:04.643
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just remember being really defensive </v>

1958
01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:09.520
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1959
01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:10.413
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was so long ago and now it's come </v>

1960
01:47:12.491 --> 01:47:13.324
<v Speaker 3>to the point where I've slowly kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized that like my anxiety has given </v>

1961
01:47:17.101 --> 01:47:19.900
<v Speaker 3>away at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's morphed into something else.</v>

1962
01:47:19.901 --> 01:47:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Like in college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my anxiety was just this crippling a,</v>

1963
01:47:28.650 --> 01:47:29.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1964
01:47:29.671 --> 01:47:30.504
<v Speaker 3>it's free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's frequent that anxiety and </v>

1965
01:47:31.771 --> 01:47:34.180
<v Speaker 3>depression go hand in hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1966
01:47:35.190 --> 01:47:39.720
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more I thought about it and the more</v>

1967
01:47:39.721 --> 01:47:40.554
<v Speaker 3>time I had to accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized that it was probably at this </v>

1968
01:47:43.801 --> 01:47:45.660
<v Speaker 3>point more depression than there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety.</v>

1969
01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:48.513
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like I addressed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety because I accepted that that's </v>

1970
01:47:52.111 --> 01:47:52.950
<v Speaker 3>what I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1971
01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:55.260
<v Speaker 3>but the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so,</v>

1972
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:59.820
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to have it so bad that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignored it and never addressed it.</v>

1973
01:47:59.821 --> 01:48:00.654
<v Speaker 3>And so now I feel like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm really accepting it after </v>

1974
01:48:07.291 --> 01:48:09.840
<v Speaker 3>looking back and thinking how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why people ask for </v>
<v Speaker 3>zip codes anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2049
01:51:45.710 --> 01:51:46.543
<v Speaker 3>Remember zip codes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm overwhelmed to make decisions </v>

2050
01:51:52.191 --> 01:51:54.080
<v Speaker 3>whether big or small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unmanned man.</v>

2051
01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:58.580
<v Speaker 3>It was like just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was at the point recently where</v>

2052
01:51:58.581 --> 01:51:59.414
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot continue to live my life like </v>

2053
01:52:03.921 --> 01:52:06.230
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will do anything.</v>

2054
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:08.263
<v Speaker 3>And you guys might recall me saying that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had like this bottle of </v>

2055
01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:12.524
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants by my bed for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>longest time because I felt like I </v>

2056
01:52:14.241 --> 01:52:15.074
<v Speaker 3>hadn't tried everything first and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I took three months and I actually </v>

2057
01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:20.030
<v Speaker 3>did make a lot of positive changes in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

2058
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:23.330
<v Speaker 3>but I still felt awful,</v>

2059
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:26.740
<v Speaker 3>I guess not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2060
01:52:26.741 --> 01:52:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I made a pretty good at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me the biggest,</v>

2061
01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:34.960
<v Speaker 3>the biggest thing for me was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting away from social media,</v>

2062
01:52:37.690 --> 01:52:38.523
<v Speaker 3>from Youtube and it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's hard to know sometimes it's </v>

2063
01:52:41.171 --> 01:52:46.171
<v Speaker 3>like leaving youtube sometimes makes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>more anxious</v>

2064
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:50.120
<v Speaker 2>and then everyone else gets upset and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes you more anxious.</v>

2065
01:52:50.121 --> 01:52:50.954
<v Speaker 2>And so it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to know what is the right </v>

2066
01:52:53.271 --> 01:52:55.850
<v Speaker 2>thing for you or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

2067
01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:58.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never gone to therapy there.</v>

2068
01:52:58.581 --> 01:53:00.650
<v Speaker 2>I have my first therapy appointment on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday.</v>

2069
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Pretty excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

2070
01:53:05.041 --> 01:53:06.030
<v Speaker 2>if he's going to fix me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2071
01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>

2072
01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.010
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2073
01:53:12.011 --> 01:53:12.844
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to a therapist once through a </v>

2074
01:53:15.450 --> 01:53:17.190
<v Speaker 2>kaiser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is our healthcare.</v>

2075
01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:20.090
<v Speaker 2>And it was such an awful experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted to go again.</v>

2076
01:53:20.130 --> 01:53:20.963
<v Speaker 2>I show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Mcdonald's therapy I show up </v>

2077
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:26.460
<v Speaker 2>and right out the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2078
01:53:26.461 --> 01:53:27.720
<v Speaker 2>you expect that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always like,</v>

2079
01:53:27.721 --> 01:53:29.490
<v Speaker 2>tell me about your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did you grow up?</v>

2080
01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to know the guy,</v>

2081
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:33.000
<v Speaker 2>get comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I sit down and I swear to God,</v>

2082
01:53:33.001 --> 01:53:33.960
<v Speaker 2>this is what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2083
01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:36.150
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what's wrong?</v>

2084
01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:38.360
<v Speaker 2>But what do you want to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2085
01:53:38.530 --> 01:53:39.900
<v Speaker 2>what's bothering you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong?</v>

2086
01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:41.213
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2087
01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:46.320
<v Speaker 2>like fucking go to treat a girl to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner before you fucker.</v>

2088
01:53:47.290 --> 01:53:51.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just blown away by that.</v>

2089
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:52.920
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's bothering you?</v>

2090
01:53:53.070 --> 01:53:54.150
<v Speaker 2>We have 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

2091
01:53:54.151 --> 01:53:55.980
<v Speaker 2>We've got plenty of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of patients here.</v>

2092
01:53:57.240 --> 01:53:58.073
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt so uncomfortable do the whole </v>

2093
01:54:00.151 --> 01:54:03.540
<v Speaker 2>thing because I don't know this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

2094
01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:04.433
<v Speaker 2>oh well we've got a bunch of ads on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube channel that I don't want to do </v>

2095
01:54:10.590 --> 01:54:14.670
<v Speaker 2>and I don't feel like making content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have these obligations.</v>

2096
01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so tell me,</v>

2097
01:54:17.701 --> 01:54:18.511
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did.</v>

2098
01:54:18.511 --> 01:54:19.800
<v Speaker 2>So how do you make money on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>

2099
01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:28.460
<v Speaker 2>Was fucking awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

2100
01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:32.500
<v Speaker 2>That's like a great name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me what's bothering you,</v>

2101
01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:34.900
<v Speaker 2>what's on your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2102
01:54:34.901 --> 01:54:35.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father,</v>

2103
01:54:35.871 --> 01:54:37.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raped me when I was a kid and uh,</v>

2104
01:54:38.010 --> 01:54:39.190
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well here's what you do.</v>

2105
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:40.833
<v Speaker 2>Just forget all about that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to a private therapists </v>

2106
01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:48.760
<v Speaker 2>that came highly recommended from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend.</v>

2107
01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:53.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm really excited to Beverly Hills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2108
01:54:53.201 --> 01:54:55.610
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2109
01:54:55.930 --> 01:55:00.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2110
01:55:01.570 --> 01:55:04.900
<v Speaker 2>but to answer your original question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took a bit of a tangent here.</v>

2111
01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:06.933
<v Speaker 2>Your original question was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you confirm and admit you were </v>

2112
01:55:10.181 --> 01:55:10.871
<v Speaker 2>depressed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2113
01:55:10.871 --> 01:55:15.871
<v Speaker 2>for me it took me a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2114
01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:17.493
<v Speaker 2>because I was embarrassed and ashamed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I felt like people around it's kind </v>

2115
01:55:24.461 --> 01:55:28.340
<v Speaker 2>of embarrassing thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2116
01:55:28.341 --> 01:55:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2117
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:33.110
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get over it.</v>

2118
01:55:34.670 --> 01:55:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I got an email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just don't understand.</v>

2119
01:55:36.831 --> 01:55:38.630
<v Speaker 2>I got an email from someone that like A.</v>

2120
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever people don't understand.</v>

2121
01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:47.780
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2122
01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:49.580
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just ask yourself,</v>

2123
01:55:49.581 --> 01:55:50.414
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you clearly are aware that something's </v>

2124
01:55:53.961 --> 01:55:54.794
<v Speaker 2>off and you're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's clearly some aspects of your </v>

2125
01:55:58.821 --> 01:55:59.654
<v Speaker 2>life that are you're not happy with and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not comfortable with that you </v>

2126
01:56:02.201 --> 01:56:03.034
<v Speaker 2>would like to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're causing you to feel possibly </v>

2127
01:56:05.841 --> 01:56:07.250
<v Speaker 2>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

2128
01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I would consider looking at these </v>
<v Speaker 2>symptoms because for me it's really just</v>

2129
01:56:14.331 --> 01:56:15.164
<v Speaker 2>been crippling and a large part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why we've just been gone for so </v>

2130
01:56:20.421 --> 01:56:25.421
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also I'm not a professional.</v>

2131
01:56:25.491 --> 01:56:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't diagnose you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you should.</v>

2132
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:28.910
<v Speaker 2>You should see a therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like everyone.</v>

2133
01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:30.373
<v Speaker 2>I know it seems like a luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually a friend of ours was </v>

2134
01:56:33.111 --> 01:56:34.260
<v Speaker 2>telling us like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2135
01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:36.320
<v Speaker 2>there's cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the name of this place?</v>

2136
01:56:36.321 --> 01:56:38.870
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2137
01:56:38.930 --> 01:56:39.763
<v Speaker 2>they have therapy on a sliding scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're broke you can go see a </v>

2138
01:56:43.161 --> 01:56:44.420
<v Speaker 2>therapist for 20 bucks.</v>

2139
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:45.703
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

2140
01:56:46.050 --> 01:56:47.190
<v Speaker 2>and also there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2141
01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:48.293
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2142
01:56:48.330 --> 01:56:49.163
<v Speaker 2>there's ways to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately I think it's important </v>

2143
01:56:53.281 --> 01:56:56.010
<v Speaker 2>for people to know that you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to suffer,</v>

2144
01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:01.040
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to carry it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to make the decision that you're</v>

2145
01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:05.780
<v Speaker 2>just going to fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2146
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:09.950
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be a victim to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

2147
01:57:09.951 --> 01:57:10.784
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

2148
01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:14.353
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're just wasting your time </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this earth to feeling miserable and </v>

2149
01:57:16.861 --> 01:57:19.380
<v Speaker 2>what's the point of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do what you can,</v>

2150
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:20.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a lot of people before </v>

2151
01:57:24.931 --> 01:57:25.764
<v Speaker 2>you that have dealt with it and gotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the woods and they're really </v>

2152
01:57:30.661 --> 01:57:35.661
<v Speaker 2>smart and they are there to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else because it sucks there to</v>

2153
01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:39.780
<v Speaker 2>help you with therapy because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>geniuses.</v>

2154
01:57:39.781 --> 01:57:42.480
<v Speaker 2>These therapists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have studied,</v>

2155
01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:46.200
<v Speaker 2>they have phds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have studied this shit for decades.</v>

2156
01:57:46.201 --> 01:57:48.450
<v Speaker 2>They know how the brain works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2157
01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:50.820
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something.</v>

2158
01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:53.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the brain works.</v>

2159
01:57:53.731 --> 01:57:54.564
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can get in your head and </v>

2160
01:57:55.921 --> 01:57:59.850
<v Speaker 2>untangle shit and understand you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that you can't.</v>

2161
01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:06.620
<v Speaker 2>They've got drugs that help ease the </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden while you figure it out.</v>

2162
01:58:09.930 --> 01:58:10.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2163
01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:15.230
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to be miserable all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2164
01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:17.580
<v Speaker 2>if you already are miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you have to lose anyway?</v>

2165
01:58:17.610 --> 01:58:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Because a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like at one at,</v>

2166
01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:25.650
<v Speaker 2>at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing else matters,</v>

2167
01:58:25.651 --> 01:58:29.430
<v Speaker 2>but getting better because what does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does anything matter?</v>

2168
01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:33.420
<v Speaker 2>If you're that miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like what else?</v>

2169
01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:34.493
<v Speaker 2>At that point matters at all except </v>
<v Speaker 2>prioritizing number one yourself and </v>

2170
01:58:39.721 --> 01:58:41.560
<v Speaker 2>getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't help anyone around.</v>

2171
01:58:41.561 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 2>You can't do</v>

2172
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:44.980
<v Speaker 3>anything for yourself or anyone else </v>
<v Speaker 3>until you feel better.</v>

2173
01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:51.800
<v Speaker 3>So that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my opinion.</v>

2174
01:58:53.130 --> 01:58:55.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2175
01:58:58.970 --> 01:59:00.890
<v Speaker 3>and depressions on the rise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2176
01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:01.993
<v Speaker 3>more people are feeling it more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever because my theory personally on </v>

2177
01:59:06.591 --> 01:59:11.030
<v Speaker 3>that is that the world is increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex,</v>

2178
01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:12.253
<v Speaker 3>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to find your place in the </v>

2179
01:59:15.501 --> 01:59:19.580
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the find a spouse in the world to find a</v>

2180
01:59:19.581 --> 01:59:21.140
<v Speaker 3>career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to find a purpose,</v>

2181
01:59:21.410 --> 01:59:22.243
<v Speaker 3>to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is so hard to figure out </v>

2182
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.823
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2183
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:31.040
<v Speaker 3>and we carry a lot of stress and </v>
<v Speaker 3>alongside a lot of bills,</v>

2184
01:59:31.041 --> 01:59:32.540
<v Speaker 3>a lot of responsibility</v>

2185
01:59:32.610 --> 01:59:34.670
<v Speaker 9>generation especially like who can </v>
<v Speaker 9>afford it.</v>

2186
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:36.660
<v Speaker 9>No fucking body.</v>

2187
01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:39.753
<v Speaker 3>Like I think about our situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are fortunate enough to have been </v>

2188
01:59:42.340 --> 01:59:43.360
<v Speaker 3>able to buy a house.</v>

2189
01:59:44.050 --> 01:59:44.883
<v Speaker 9>But,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I know the feeling from you just a </v>

2190
01:59:46.690 --> 01:59:47.523
<v Speaker 9>few years ago did we?</v>
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

2191
01:59:47.670 --> 01:59:47.980
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we,</v>

2192
01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:50.710
<v Speaker 9>we've worked all our life and we weren't</v>
<v Speaker 9>even close.</v>

2193
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:52.890
<v Speaker 9>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we were on.</v>

2194
01:59:53.190 --> 01:59:54.023
<v Speaker 3>We were statistically anomalous with our</v>
<v Speaker 3>success and the amount of money that we </v>

2195
02:00:01.061 --> 02:00:04.140
<v Speaker 3>were able to make in the short time from</v>
<v Speaker 3>being successful.</v>

2196
02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:06.720
<v Speaker 3>But we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

2197
02:00:06.721 --> 02:00:10.020
<v Speaker 3>just a couple short years earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making like 30,</v>

2198
02:00:10.021 --> 02:00:12.000
<v Speaker 3>$40,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you and the two of us.</v>

2199
02:00:12.810 --> 02:00:13.643
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2200
02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:17.230
<v Speaker 3>that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2201
02:00:17.290 --> 02:00:18.430
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy a house.</v>

2202
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:21.663
<v Speaker 3>Never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wonder when we're in this </v>

2203
02:00:25.061 --> 02:00:29.380
<v Speaker 3>anomalous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an unbelievably lucky situation.</v>

2204
02:00:29.860 --> 02:00:31.690
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck does anyone else have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chance?</v>

2205
02:00:32.230 --> 02:00:33.290
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

2206
02:00:33.291 --> 02:00:34.124
<v Speaker 3>that you can be at any station of life </v>
<v Speaker 3>and still life is complicated in this </v>

2207
02:00:39.610 --> 02:00:41.590
<v Speaker 3>day and age with the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the cars,</v>

2208
02:00:41.591 --> 02:00:42.424
<v Speaker 3>with bill's responsibility and know I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>more depressed now because I feel more </v>

2209
02:00:47.801 --> 02:00:52.180
<v Speaker 3>lost in my purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

2210
02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:56.920
<v Speaker 3>I actually heard a really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember who said it,</v>

2211
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:57.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2212
02:00:58.270 --> 02:01:02.470
<v Speaker 3>when you have money and like financial </v>
<v Speaker 3>safety,</v>

2213
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:05.050
<v Speaker 3>all that's left is in your head.</v>

2214
02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:09.533
<v Speaker 9>That was talking to about not when I.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Cause I was saying before that you're </v>

2215
02:01:14.921 --> 02:01:15.940
<v Speaker 9>always like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

2216
02:01:15.941 --> 02:01:19.990
<v Speaker 9>if only I could afford that trip,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I wouldn't be happy.</v>

2217
02:01:19.991 --> 02:01:22.250
<v Speaker 9>But until then I can afford it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>or if I just or,</v>

2218
02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:25.060
<v Speaker 9>or it's like if only I could afford this</v>
<v Speaker 9>house,</v>

2219
02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:26.390
<v Speaker 9>that would be perfect.</v>

2220
02:01:26.410 --> 02:01:27.670
<v Speaker 3>My thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2221
02:01:27.730 --> 02:01:29.530
<v Speaker 3>if only I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't pay rent,</v>

2222
02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:31.870
<v Speaker 3>rent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be set for life.</v>

2223
02:01:32.010 --> 02:01:35.220
<v Speaker 9>So you always have this like you're </v>
<v Speaker 9>chasing a goal.</v>

2224
02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:36.113
<v Speaker 9>If I then I'll be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right now I'm not happy because I can't </v>

2225
02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:41.600
<v Speaker 9>afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But you work towards it and it gives you</v>

2226
02:01:41.601 --> 02:01:43.710
<v Speaker 9>a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2227
02:01:44.090 --> 02:01:47.390
<v Speaker 9>But when you can afford it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 9>still not happy,</v>

2228
02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:48.763
<v Speaker 9>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what is that thing that will make me </v>

2229
02:01:50.091 --> 02:01:50.924
<v Speaker 9>happy?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2230
02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:52.910
<v Speaker 3>But I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

2231
02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:54.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a rare situation.</v>

2232
02:01:54.621 --> 02:01:56.450
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to relate to what I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>through there.</v>

2233
02:01:56.810 --> 02:02:00.650
<v Speaker 3>But just generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is so complicated.</v>

2234
02:02:00.651 --> 02:02:01.484
<v Speaker 3>Like think back 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people didn't have phones that have </v>

2235
02:02:03.111 --> 02:02:05.690
<v Speaker 3>fucking Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just worked on farms.</v>

2236
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:13.130
<v Speaker 3>I genuinely think that like if you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>woke up at 8:00</v>

2237
02:02:13.130 --> 02:02:13.963
<v Speaker 3>AM and worked on the farm for eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours and went home and ate dinner and </v>

2238
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:19.700
<v Speaker 3>chill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like that simple man.</v>

2239
02:02:19.701 --> 02:02:22.850
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to crave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's,</v>

2240
02:02:22.851 --> 02:02:23.684
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2241
02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:27.350
<v Speaker 3>And I think that like modern day life </v>
<v Speaker 3>really goes against our,</v>

2242
02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:33.460
<v Speaker 3>are a fundamental instincts as animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like billions of years of,</v>

2243
02:02:36.970 --> 02:02:37.770
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2244
02:02:37.770 --> 02:02:42.770
<v Speaker 3>end stinks and expectation of what life </v>
<v Speaker 3>is and how to survive.</v>

2245
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.960
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2246
02:02:44.961 --> 02:02:45.794
<v Speaker 3>Billions of years of survival instincts </v>
<v Speaker 3>have all of the sudden in the past 100 </v>

2247
02:02:49.521 --> 02:02:50.354
<v Speaker 3>years completely betrayed us because all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden these survival instincts </v>

2248
02:02:54.531 --> 02:02:58.760
<v Speaker 3>that we've inherited over evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of years are no longer relevant</v>

2249
02:02:58.790 --> 02:03:01.040
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2250
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:06.250
<v Speaker 3>And that's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think a lot of people have,</v>

2251
02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:08.360
<v Speaker 3>have trouble adjusting.</v>

2252
02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:12.170
<v Speaker 9>It's weird because also you all of a </v>
<v Speaker 9>sudden,</v>

2253
02:03:12.171 --> 02:03:15.740
<v Speaker 9>I didn't have a lot of opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The demon before.</v>

2254
02:03:16.090 --> 02:03:17.450
<v Speaker 9>You have a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2255
02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:19.340
<v Speaker 9>there's a lot of good that came with it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Sure.</v>

2256
02:03:19.370 --> 02:03:22.830
<v Speaker 9>But it's also great playing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2257
02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:26.400
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2258
02:03:26.430 --> 02:03:28.880
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

2259
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:29.743
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important to bear that in </v>

2260
02:03:35.261 --> 02:03:36.094
<v Speaker 3>mind that life is really fucking can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>very challenging and confusing and </v>

2261
02:03:43.701 --> 02:03:44.534
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like my God who can balance all </v>

2262
02:03:45.801 --> 02:03:50.120
<v Speaker 3>those things when instinctually I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to go plant some carrots,</v>

2263
02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:52.693
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or go gather some berries or some shit </v>

2264
02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:56.590
<v Speaker 3>or go kill a deer and then chill and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>TP,</v>

2265
02:03:57.770 --> 02:04:02.770
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

2266
02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:09.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking forward to the essays of </v>
<v Speaker 3>disproving my theory.</v>

2267
02:04:13.150 --> 02:04:13.983
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just my thoughts and if you </v>

2268
02:04:14.471 --> 02:04:15.670
<v Speaker 3>disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong.</v>

2269
02:04:17.290 --> 02:04:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope I wish you all the best.</v>

2270
02:04:18.971 --> 02:04:23.971
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2271
02:04:24.201 --> 02:04:25.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should dump.</v>

2272
02:04:25.461 --> 02:04:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Don't be afraid to seek help and don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel weak because you are not alone.</v>

2273
02:04:29.391 --> 02:04:34.391
<v Speaker 3>And increasingly less alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2274
02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:39.520
<v Speaker 3>100 years ago was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe 200,000</v>

2275
02:04:42.461 --> 02:04:44.500
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2276
02:04:44.501 --> 02:04:46.510
<v Speaker 3>if I've heard this and I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true,</v>

2277
02:04:46.930 --> 02:04:47.763
<v Speaker 3>but I've heard this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that like an amish communities that </v>

2278
02:04:50.501 --> 02:04:54.040
<v Speaker 3>depression and anxiety is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely nonexistent.</v>

2279
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:56.383
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

2280
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:58.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know about the amish.</v>

2281
02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:00.150
<v Speaker 3>The Amish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2282
02:05:00.150 --> 02:05:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

2283
02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:03.430
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2284
02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Because they're fully fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have very basic,</v>

2285
02:05:09.930 --> 02:05:11.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not basic,</v>

2286
02:05:11.531 --> 02:05:12.364
<v Speaker 3>but they have very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know what to expect every day and </v>

2287
02:05:15.491 --> 02:05:18.910
<v Speaker 3>they're fulfilled every day and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>life is,</v>

2288
02:05:18.970 --> 02:05:19.803
<v Speaker 3>they understand what it is day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you went about how many </v>

2289
02:05:23.201 --> 02:05:25.420
<v Speaker 3>days do you wake up and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2290
02:05:25.421 --> 02:05:26.000
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2291
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.360
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what am I going to do today?</v>

2292
02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2293
02:05:31.150 --> 02:05:34.000
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

2294
02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Papa's in the backyard.</v>

2295
02:05:42.970 --> 02:05:43.810

<v Speaker 3>flapping in the wind.</v>

2297
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Papa clutches his heart play the music.</v>

2298
02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:55.530
<v Speaker 4>Papa clutches his heart</v>

2299
02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:59.960
<v Speaker 3>is running around the backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing with a paper airplane.</v>

2300
02:06:01.050 --> 02:06:02.630
<v Speaker 3>And Papa clutches his heart.</v>

2301
02:06:07.730 --> 02:06:12.730
<v Speaker 4>I feel mad with no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no pizza sauce.</v>
