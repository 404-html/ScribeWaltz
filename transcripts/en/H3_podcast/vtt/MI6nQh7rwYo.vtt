00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 2>come in today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a big ass meal.</v>

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 2>I could barely move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we did it.</v>

11
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.060
<v Speaker 2>We came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did it.</v>

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.393
<v Speaker 2>Today's episode is sponsored by </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmates dollar shave club and Vince </v>

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Sero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How was all of your thanksgiving?</v>

15
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 2>How was your thanksgiving?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You luckily you made,</v>

16
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 2>I know her food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 2>so I enjoyed some food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like the Thanksgiving food.</v>

18
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I make a confession?</v>

19
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't like Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most boring meet imaginable and</v>

20
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 2>it's like the Gamey.</v>

21
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 2>It's dry usually it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not there.</v>

22
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just now it's not a word of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bird.</v>

23
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 2>And you read it with the cranberry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cranberry.</v>

24
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:24.594
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's people at home who were </v>

25
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:28.670
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

26
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I know it's a very polarizing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like stuffing.</v>

27
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't like cranberry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like Turkey.</v>

28
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 2>But I took Thanksgiving it to my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands because I said,</v>

29
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:38.094
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make a pot roast and I </v>

30
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 2>would like to call these Ethan's </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavenly potatoes.</v>

31
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.433
<v Speaker 2>True cause I wanted to make sure isla </v>
<v Speaker 2>could eat and what Ethan's heavenly </v>

32
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 2>mashed potatoes and let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

33
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.773
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't do any good because </v>

34
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 2>it's all about the technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people see what's in it,</v>

35
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 2>they can't believe that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>taste good.</v>

36
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Well sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you should be,</v>

37
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 2>you should be horrified by what I put in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

38
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.590
<v Speaker 2>But that's the secret to every good </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurants cooking,</v>

39
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that's why food at restaurants tastes</v>

40
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:14.094
<v Speaker 2>so unbelievably good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because if you actually went back </v>

41
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:17.064
<v Speaker 2>there in the kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would never have the balls to cook </v>

42
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 2>food the way they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

43
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting a whole stick of butter and for </v>

44
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 2>like two eggs scrambled eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

45
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these scrambled eggs are amazing.</v>

46
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I never had my eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never tastes like this before.</v>

47
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.663
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole stick of butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I do is I put a whole stick of </v>

48
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:42.831
<v Speaker 2>butter and a whole block of cream shoes </v>
<v Speaker 2>for every four potatoes.</v>

49
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.290
<v Speaker 2>So yesterday was two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

50
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 2>there was eight potatoes to a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>sticks of butter and two whole blocks of</v>

51
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 2>cream cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I hear dad freaking out in the back,</v>

52
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that sounds bomb,</v>

53
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 2>but it is bombed Dan.</v>

54
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just tastes like potatoes.</v>

55
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even taste crazy airy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a slight,</v>

56
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.373
<v Speaker 2>it tastes incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can eat ham mouthfuls of mouthfuls </v>

57
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 2>and little do you know that every bite </v>
<v Speaker 2>has probably 200 calories.</v>

58
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 2>I love mashed potatoes is the best dish </v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever like potatoes by themselves are</v>

59
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:18.360
<v Speaker 2>already pretty unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you like,</v>

60
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 2>or like heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy,</v>

61
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just nothing really good in it I</v>

62
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 2>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not unhealthy.</v>

63
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a nutritionist.</v>

00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:25.984

<v Speaker 2>tradition in America to stomp the face </v>

151
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:16.240
<v Speaker 2>of every grandma and the way of your new</v>
<v Speaker 2>ps four.</v>

152
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.120
<v Speaker 2>But I have to say this year we had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mellow,</v>

153
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.490
<v Speaker 2>mellow year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see any fights.</v>

154
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:23.860

<v Speaker 2>nothing like that.</v>

157
00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:29.314
<v Speaker 2>I think the stores have finally gotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart and it's more like the older </v>

<v Speaker 4>and usual</v>

244
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.030
<v Speaker 2>punishment and constitutional under the </v>

<v Speaker 5>They're getting a round of applause.</v>

250
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.163
<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>

<v Speaker 5>they're Canadians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look how wonderful this is.</v>

253
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:34.174
<v Speaker 5>It probably served coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just walking in super orderly </v>

254
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:41.370
<v Speaker 5>and calm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The employees are lined up and giving up</v>

255
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.500
<v Speaker 5>ground look like giving high fives and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then have a five.</v>

256
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.540
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a,</v>

257
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.380
<v Speaker 5>what a joy.</v>

258
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.610
<v Speaker 2>What a thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a thrill.</v>

259
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I was thinking,</v>

260
00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I was watching that it just takes one </v>
<v Speaker 2>lunatic to start running and it sets off</v>

261
00:13:57.021 --> 00:13:59.070
<v Speaker 2>that chain reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

262
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.900
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

263
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.531
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

264
00:14:00.531 --> 00:14:01.364
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if one person from the bottom </v>

265
00:14:02.361 --> 00:14:04.730
<v Speaker 2>started cutting and running a front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

266
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Full riot mode and America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got five of those from the beginning</v>

267
00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:10.214
<v Speaker 2>and nobody ever had a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there you have it black Friday and </v>

268
00:14:12.981 --> 00:14:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now finally,</v>

269
00:14:14.631 --> 00:14:19.631
<v Speaker 2>as you all know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazil is as a crime ridden country.</v>

270
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.110
<v Speaker 2>There's huge disparities of very rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>and very poor.</v>

271
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Lots of corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a rough place.</v>

272
00:14:26.571 --> 00:14:29.420
<v Speaker 2>So black Friday in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can imagine,</v>

273
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.950
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be one of the craziest </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you ever see.</v>

274
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.443
<v Speaker 2>And so I warn people with young children</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who are sensitive to trigger </v>

275
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:43.790
<v Speaker 2>warnings to a divert their eyes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>this very graphic scene.</v>

276
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.700
<v Speaker 5>Black Friday and breasts here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I see it.</v>

277
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.750
<v Speaker 5>I got the mascot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some girl was,</v>

278
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

279
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.300
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

280
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.003
<v Speaker 5>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the employees are lined up at the </v>

281
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:02.804
<v Speaker 5>gate and they're about to start pounding</v>
<v Speaker 5>it to get everyone outside super </v>

282
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.790
<v Speaker 5>heightened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When here we go,</v>

283
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 5>they got a Dj by the sound of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're pounding on the wall.</v>

284
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 5>Get ready everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here we go.</v>

285
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to come through shit</v>

286
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.450
<v Speaker 5>completely empty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not a thing of person outside,</v>

287
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 5>not even one single person out that </v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody's there.</v>

288
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.203
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how they missed this violated </v>

289
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.590
<v Speaker 2>or got in trouble for it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

291
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.090
<v Speaker 2>I find it fascinating that nobody peeked</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

292
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.153
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love how they're pounding on the gay </v>

<v Speaker 2>not even one person got the memo,</v>

294

<v Speaker 2>not even one person.</v>

<v Speaker 5>long time.</v>

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.223
<v Speaker 5>The audience is losing their mind </v>
<v Speaker 5>because this is the most exciting thing </v>

343

<v Speaker 5>Probably.</v>

347
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They fill those up with helium.</v>

348
00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:13.060

<v Speaker 5>like a lot of helium.</v>

351
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.103

<v Speaker 5>I've heard that it's a finite resource </v>

352
00:19:23.351 --> 00:19:27.040
<v Speaker 5>that cannot be replenished.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was a good thing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's pretty daunting.</v>

383

<v Speaker 5>Does it remind you of Goldberg traveled </v>

<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:27.003

672
00:37:29.731 --> 00:37:33.420
<v Speaker 9>I'm much more younger.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Demos 68 so when I ask for a mortgage,</v>

673
00:37:33.421 --> 00:37:34.320
<v Speaker 9>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they say,</v>

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:37.560
<v Speaker 9>is it possible if I go on tinder?</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

675
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:38.903
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about it that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a mortgage at all age cause you'll </v>

676
00:37:41.161 --> 00:37:43.170
<v Speaker 2>die before he can pay it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

680
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.350
<v Speaker 2>but I guess they don't take the risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

681
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:54.690
<v Speaker 2>did you want a mortgage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're 69 ish.</v>

684
00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:09.420
<v Speaker 9>from 68 or 69 when the woman are there </v>
<v Speaker 9>and when I'm mocked in the,</v>

685
00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:11.630
<v Speaker 9>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then they say,</v>

686
00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.640
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then lie for your eight.</v>

687
00:38:13.641 --> 00:38:16.850
<v Speaker 9>You say you are 49 I don't want to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I want to be myself.</v>

688
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:21.380
<v Speaker 9>So don't force me to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But when I am really 49 again,</v>

689
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.440
<v Speaker 9>I will have a baby again.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I will buy a new car again,</v>

690
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:28.430
<v Speaker 9>I will pay my house again.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I go outside and I invest my money again</v>

691
00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.320
<v Speaker 9>because now I'm old man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

692
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.440
<v Speaker 9>I have to save my money to give to my </v>
<v Speaker 9>kids so they can live.</v>

693
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.060
<v Speaker 9>But if I have that h</v>

694
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.873
<v Speaker 2>I have hope again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm new again and there is the whole </v>

695
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 2>future is there for me again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

696
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Iron clad logic right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to say,</v>

697
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:45.423
<v Speaker 2>well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's been a lot of debate </v>

698
00:38:47.561 --> 00:38:48.394
<v Speaker 2>about changing genders and this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing and that gender is a </v>

699
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.253
<v Speaker 2>construct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a social construct and people changing </v>

700
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:56.494
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all this,</v>

701
00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can debate about,</v>

702
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.343
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can debate about gender roles and </v>

703
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:06.430
<v Speaker 2>that old things time however I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>indisputable,</v>

704
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 2>at least right now as far as we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

705
00:39:09.971 --> 00:39:14.971
<v Speaker 2>time is a linear fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're time traveling yet.</v>

706
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:21.323
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he described himself as a young God is </v>

707
00:39:24.861 --> 00:39:29.861
<v Speaker 2>he did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said a 69 year old,</v>

708
00:39:30.921 --> 00:39:31.754
<v Speaker 2>he's a positivity guru.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says he does not feel his age and it </v>

709
00:39:35.211 --> 00:39:36.044
<v Speaker 2>started a battle to make himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegally 20 years younger on the </v>

710
00:39:38.181 --> 00:39:40.790
<v Speaker 2>grounds that he's being discriminated on</v>
<v Speaker 2>dating apps.</v>

711
00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Doctors told him his body was that of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>45 year old man and he described himself</v>

712
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:52.370
<v Speaker 2>as a young God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

713
00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.413
<v Speaker 2>that judge expressed skepticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also noted that changing the sex on </v>

714
00:39:56.301 --> 00:39:59.780
<v Speaker 2>a birth certificate as a transgender </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have the right to do that,</v>

715
00:39:59.781 --> 00:40:00.614
<v Speaker 2>which was once impossible is now allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>tension or people around the world have </v>

716
00:40:03.591 --> 00:40:07.340
<v Speaker 2>fought long battles of the right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change their birth certificates to match</v>

717
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:10.250
<v Speaker 2>their gender identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where this is permitted,</v>

718
00:40:10.251 --> 00:40:12.350
<v Speaker 2>the legal requirements vary in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands.</v>

719
00:40:12.351 --> 00:40:13.184
<v Speaker 2>Transgender people need a statement from</v>
<v Speaker 2>an expert affirming that they have a </v>

720
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.790
<v Speaker 2>purr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>purr,</v>

721
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:18.103
<v Speaker 2>permanent conviction that their gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>does not match what is on their birth </v>

722
00:40:21.231 --> 00:40:23.720
<v Speaker 2>certificate and that they understand the</v>
<v Speaker 2>repercussions of their decision.</v>

723
00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:24.913
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

724
00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>

725
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:29.143
<v Speaker 2>gender is a kind of an abstract idea in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense that it's not a physical the </v>

726
00:40:34.071 --> 00:40:36.680
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here we're talking about age.</v>

727
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:37.943
<v Speaker 7>I mean</v>

728
00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.910
<v Speaker 2>we can debate age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

729
00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:46.160
<v Speaker 2>But apparently the judge is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unlikely to happen,</v>

730
00:40:46.161 --> 00:40:48.760
<v Speaker 2>but the judge is like open minded about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it too.</v>

731
00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:49.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

732
00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:50.051
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

733
00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:52.790
<v Speaker 2>what does our world be when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide their own age?</v>

734
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Like a 13 year old or like an 18 old </v>
<v Speaker 2>being like I'm 20,</v>

735
00:40:56.511 --> 00:41:01.511
<v Speaker 2>I am actually 21 it's an emotional age </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they call it an emotional age.</v>

736
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong?</v>

737
00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:09.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine.</v>

738
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I you do it.</v>

739
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:16.563
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

740
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:20.171
<v Speaker 2>I like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

741
00:41:20.171 --> 00:41:21.004
<v Speaker 2>he almost talks that if he was able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change his age to like 45 that he'd be </v>

742
00:41:24.371 --> 00:41:26.230
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like my Dick will work again.</v>

743
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:27.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like it will like magically like </v>

744
00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.800
<v Speaker 2>actually reverses age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get a mortgage,</v>

745
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:37.610
<v Speaker 2>my Dick will work there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have it.</v>

746
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.030
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that's a weird one.</v>

747
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.420
<v Speaker 2>He looks pretty good for 69.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give him that.</v>

748
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he is a young God,</v>

749
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.100
<v Speaker 8>but you should embrace.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hmm.</v>

750
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I think his problem is that would look </v>
<v Speaker 2>old for 49.</v>

751
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fuck 69 year olds.</v>

756

<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

765
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

766
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.430
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the articles I've read,</v>

767
00:42:45.431 --> 00:42:46.264
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to take it very seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you've said that you had read </v>

768
00:42:47.741 --> 00:42:48.940
<v Speaker 2>something that it's some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein.</v>

769
00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.033
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I had seen somewhere that </v>

770
00:42:50.881 --> 00:42:52.920
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's trying to,</v>

771
00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

772
00:42:54.181 --> 00:42:55.014
<v Speaker 3>I mean like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you brought up the whole gender issue </v>

773
00:42:56.671 --> 00:42:57.504
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he maybe is trying to make a </v>

774
00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:02.370
<v Speaker 3>point about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

775
00:43:02.371 --> 00:43:03.204
<v Speaker 3>I mean like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously it's pretty fucking </v>

776
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.980
<v Speaker 3>difference session.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awful.</v>

777
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

778
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:08.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see people always trying to make this</v>

779
00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:09.603
<v Speaker 8>my,</v>
<v Speaker 8>are you really gonna compare that to a </v>

780
00:43:12.291 --> 00:43:13.220
<v Speaker 8>gender issue?</v>

781
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:18.090
<v Speaker 2>One is like measurably wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

782
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:19.470
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're by people who will say,</v>

783
00:43:19.471 --> 00:43:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're bowling with the Dick.</v>

784
00:43:20.461 --> 00:43:21.294
<v Speaker 2>That makes you a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But still you can identify more as a </v>

785
00:43:24.391 --> 00:43:25.224
<v Speaker 2>female and so there's a debate to be had</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some empathy and understanding and </v>

786
00:43:29.071 --> 00:43:33.510
<v Speaker 2>you can physically change your sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can remove your penis and surgically</v>

787
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:37.730
<v Speaker 2>implanted vagina and you can assume the </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity of a female and you can be</v>

788
00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:42.750
<v Speaker 8>born with a certain genitalia,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's kind of like in the middle.</v>

789
00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.073
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean,</v>

790
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:48.030
<v Speaker 2>like a peanut?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be both like an inverted u.</v>

791
00:43:48.031 --> 00:43:49.650
<v Speaker 2>There are some people that are born with</v>
<v Speaker 2>both.</v>

792
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.320
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Or like stuff like that.</v>

793
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:51.940
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

794
00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:52.990
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

795
00:43:52.991 --> 00:43:56.440
<v Speaker 2>but wasn't Jamie Lee Curtis born with </v>
<v Speaker 2>both a vagina and a penis?</v>

796
00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:58.210
<v Speaker 2>I swear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear,</v>

797
00:43:58.211 --> 00:43:59.590
<v Speaker 2>look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look it up.</v>

798
00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Jamie Lee Curtis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super famous.</v>

799
00:44:01.751 --> 00:44:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

800
00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.190
<v Speaker 2>she was like a babe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like one of the hottest babes in</v>

801
00:44:06.191 --> 00:44:07.024
<v Speaker 2>the 90s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me make sure I'm saying her name </v>

802
00:44:09.641 --> 00:44:10.810
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

803
00:44:10.811 --> 00:44:12.550
<v Speaker 2>that's her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was born,</v>

804
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:13.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>

805
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:15.910
<v Speaker 2>with a both a penis and a vagina.</v>

806
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that appears to just be an urban legend.</v>

807
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Idiot.</v>

808
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:23.243
<v Speaker 3>Look again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Double check that I just went to snopes </v>

809
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:29.320
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're falsing it just flat out so that</v>

810
00:44:29.321 --> 00:44:30.154
<v Speaker 3>we fact check that I evidently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason you thought that </v>

811
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause this is like a thing.</v>

812
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is not true.</v>

813
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:44.940
<v Speaker 3>I had never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would people think that about her?</v>

814
00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 3>That's so rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

815
00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Homer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is that a real thing then?</v>

816
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Because now I'm questioning if that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>

817
00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:52.591
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

818
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:55.080
<v Speaker 3>what Ula was just describing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely is a thing.</v>

819
00:44:55.081 --> 00:44:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

820
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:01.220
<v Speaker 3>when a baby is born it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of ambiguous and it's sort of,</v>

821
00:45:01.221 --> 00:45:03.350
<v Speaker 3>the doctor just kind of makes a call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

822
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.160
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is very low.</v>

823
00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.490
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A doctor just makes a call</v>

824
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:12.180
<v Speaker 8>literally that it can happen.</v>

825
00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:12.681
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

826
00:45:12.681 --> 00:45:12.851
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

827
00:45:12.851 --> 00:45:13.684
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

828
00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.021
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

829
00:45:14.021 --> 00:45:14.351
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

830
00:45:14.351 --> 00:45:14.681
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

831
00:45:14.681 --> 00:45:16.000
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to understand this.</v>

832
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:17.583
<v Speaker 2>The doctor makes a call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is he doing something to the baby or </v>

833
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:23.634
<v Speaker 2>is he just breading?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Male or female and the birth </v>

834
00:45:24.511 --> 00:45:25.740
<v Speaker 2>certificate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ladder.</v>

835
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.910
<v Speaker 2>And so what if the baby has a penis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's written down as female?</v>

836
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:31.793
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

837
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the specifics of it,</v>

838
00:45:33.451 --> 00:45:35.500
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

839
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.320
<v Speaker 3>obviously this is not super common.</v>

840
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:38.573
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just really actually curious about </v>

841
00:45:39.541 --> 00:45:42.050
<v Speaker 2>the metal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you guys look into that period?</v>

842
00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:43.741
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious.</v>

843
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's look into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

844
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:48.330
<v Speaker 2>we're so sidetracked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just fascinated by that.</v>

845
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:49.463
<v Speaker 2>So baby can be born with like either and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cannot and the doctor can't tell </v>

846
00:45:53.191 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 2>the genitalia.</v>

847
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:59.600
<v Speaker 8>Intersexuality occurs whenever human </v>
<v Speaker 8>being has both male and female physical,</v>

848
00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:04.230
<v Speaker 8>correct characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Contrary to the main thing,</v>

849
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:05.623
<v Speaker 8>they do not have two sets of genitals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They often have ambiguous genitals </v>

850
00:46:09.371 --> 00:46:10.204
<v Speaker 8>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Not readily identifiable was collectors </v>

851
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:17.510
<v Speaker 8>or penis or,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so it's somewhere in the middle.</v>

852
00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:18.443
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that means that they have like a Ho </v>

853
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.220
<v Speaker 2>like a vaginal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have a vagina,</v>

854
00:46:23.221 --> 00:46:25.530
<v Speaker 2>like an entrance and like a little penis</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

855
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:28.230
<v Speaker 2>does that mean they could actually fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves?</v>

856
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:29.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

857
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.301
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

858
00:46:30.301 --> 00:46:31.001
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

859
00:46:31.001 --> 00:46:32.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

860
00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.420
<v Speaker 3>I know you're just curious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>

861
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

862
00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking what people are thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

863
00:46:36.891 --> 00:46:38.540
<v Speaker 2>We're in pursuit of knowledge.</v>

864
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:39.960
<v Speaker 8>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

865
00:46:39.961 --> 00:46:42.210
<v Speaker 8>I'm still reading.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't want to,</v>

866
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:44.730
<v Speaker 8>I don't want to misrepresent this at </v>
<v Speaker 8>all.</v>

867
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:46.620
<v Speaker 8>But anyway.</v>

868
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of,</v>

869
00:46:48.391 --> 00:46:50.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless,</v>

870
00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:50.971
<v Speaker 3>Jamie Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>curtis,</v>

871
00:46:50.971 --> 00:46:51.804

<v Speaker 3>we have definitely cleared that one up </v>

872
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.000
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

873
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.760
<v Speaker 8>damn by,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it can be like,</v>

874
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.450
<v Speaker 8>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

875
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:06.250
<v Speaker 8>at any rate it says that you can go in </v>
<v Speaker 8>and like people can go on a long periods</v>

876
00:47:06.251 --> 00:47:09.520
<v Speaker 8>of their lives without knowing that they</v>
<v Speaker 8>were intersex</v>

877
00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:12.080
<v Speaker 2>quiet and then they like grow out of it.</v>

878
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just I think just when you're a kid,</v>

879
00:47:14.621 --> 00:47:15.454
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not necessarily seeing other </v>

880
00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:18.650
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know that you're different.</v>

881
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:19.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious</v>

882
00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.030
<v Speaker 2>to see what that looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I can't show that.</v>

883
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.050
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

884
00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.050
<v Speaker 8>but I am curious.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But anyway,</v>

885
00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.640
<v Speaker 8>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why are you seeing pictures?</v>

886
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm just trying to read about it.</v>

887
00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.610
<v Speaker 8>But that's why the gender issue is like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whoa.</v>

888
00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:34.960
<v Speaker 8>Even though regardless of</v>

889
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:35.770
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

890
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.420
<v Speaker 2>that's such a stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

891
00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:39.040
<v Speaker 2>people have been making these arguments </v>
<v Speaker 2>for so long.</v>

892
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 2>People have been saying it about </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality first they say,</v>

893
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:42.843
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if two dudes can fuck each other or </v>

894
00:47:44.171 --> 00:47:45.970
<v Speaker 2>marry each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what?</v>

895
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Then what can we start marrying animals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

896
00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.060
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

897
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:52.390
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just so weak.</v>

898
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:53.890
<v Speaker 2>It's so lame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Adam,</v>

899
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:55.990
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals cannot consent.</v>

900
00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.513
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

901
00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.980
<v Speaker 2>people always ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can vegans,</v>

902
00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a,</v>

903
00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:04.760
<v Speaker 2>can they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you come?</v>

904
00:48:04.761 --> 00:48:08.000
<v Speaker 2>And the vegans mouth people are always </v>
<v Speaker 2>asking you that.</v>

905
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:10.370
<v Speaker 2>People always ask me that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

906
00:48:10.371 --> 00:48:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I did get an email about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

907
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:13.760
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

908
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:16.100
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can come and a Vegan smells and I'll</v>

909
00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:16.934
<v Speaker 2>tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a human can consent to give you </v>

910
00:48:19.551 --> 00:48:24.551
<v Speaker 2>their semen and I assure you that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be given with much pleasure if I,</v>

911
00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:25.883
<v Speaker 2>my experience is any indication of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But animals cannot consent to give you </v>

912
00:48:30.261 --> 00:48:32.630
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I right Dan?</v>

913
00:48:32.631 --> 00:48:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Am I representing this rate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

914
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:34.700
<v Speaker 2>you're a vegetarian.</v>

915
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.500
<v Speaker 8>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Animals cannot consent to,</v>

916
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.633
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>allowing you to kill them or I guess </v>

917
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:43.800
<v Speaker 8>you're talking more about like dairy or </v>
<v Speaker 8>eggs or something like that.</v>

918
00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:44.400
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yes.</v>

919
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:44.900
<v Speaker 8>Correct.</v>

920
00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:45.700
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

921
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:50.700
<v Speaker 2>so semen is Vegan if you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consent of persons who you're sucking.</v>

922
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

923
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:52.473
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

924
00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:54.730
<v Speaker 2>did you send me a link?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want me to read this?</v>

925
00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:59.460
<v Speaker 8>So back to that previous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

926
00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:00.743
<v Speaker 8>I just want to correct that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It could look like a male or female </v>

927
00:49:04.471 --> 00:49:08.460
<v Speaker 8>genitalia isn't look weird necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you are homeless.</v>

928
00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.313
<v Speaker 8>Could be,</v>

929
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:11.163
<v Speaker 10>Eh,</v>

930
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:15.050
<v Speaker 8>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like you could have the other hormones.</v>

931
00:49:15.051 --> 00:49:17.480
<v Speaker 8>So sometimes that's the only during </v>
<v Speaker 8>puberty.</v>

932
00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:18.373
<v Speaker 8>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You'll feel different than the gender </v>

933
00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.670
<v Speaker 8>that was given.</v>

934
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:22.503
<v Speaker 2>I'll show my screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking up in her s intersects </v>

935
00:49:24.321 --> 00:49:25.190

936
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:27.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay man.</v>

937
00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:32.400
<v Speaker 8>But they said that it happened actually </v>
<v Speaker 8>a lot more than people realize.</v>

938
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:36.600
<v Speaker 8>One in 100 people in the u s want.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what I had heard too.</v>

939
00:49:36.601 --> 00:49:39.060
<v Speaker 8>I didn't want to say it just off the top</v>
<v Speaker 8>of my head and be wrong.</v>

940
00:49:39.061 --> 00:49:40.080
<v Speaker 8>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's um,</v>

941
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.190
<v Speaker 8>it's much more common than</v>

942

<v Speaker 2>I swear to God,</v>

944
00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:51.803
<v Speaker 8>they're definitely appear.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I guess that was an urban legend that </v>

945
00:49:53.841 --> 00:49:57.740
<v Speaker 8>existed because many articles came up </v>
<v Speaker 8>about it when I googled it.</v>

946
00:49:57.741 --> 00:50:00.320
<v Speaker 8>So I don't know how I'd never heard that</v>
<v Speaker 8>before.</v>

947
00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:01.110
<v Speaker 8>It's just,</v>

948
00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I heard that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

949
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:05.700
<v Speaker 2>as like a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>False.</v>

950
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:08.220
<v Speaker 2>False.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

951
00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:09.083
<v Speaker 2>let's see here.</v>

952
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is She,</v>

953
00:50:12.901 --> 00:50:14.430
<v Speaker 2>she's a sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But regardless,</v>

954
00:50:14.431 --> 00:50:19.431
<v Speaker 2>I find that that argument very listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuals,</v>

955
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:22.680
<v Speaker 2>transsexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people,</v>

956
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:23.723
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole campaign of like trying to </v>

957
00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:31.801
<v Speaker 2>why our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

958
00:50:31.801 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 2>why are you even trying to contradict </v>
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>

959
00:50:33.591 --> 00:50:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Just let them live their live like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

960
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously some of them are pretty</v>

961
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.480
<v Speaker 2>aggressive and annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

962
00:50:44.481 --> 00:50:46.190
<v Speaker 2>there's extremes in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

963
00:50:46.191 --> 00:50:48.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if someone's just like,</v>

964
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm transgender,</v>

965
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that being an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

966
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:56.180
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this guy is doing it as a protest,</v>

967
00:50:56.181 --> 00:50:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

968
00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:02.180
<v Speaker 2>very weak because time is measured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dude,</v>

969
00:51:02.181 --> 00:51:07.181
<v Speaker 2>you have been on this earth for 69 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>and unless I missed a memo,</v>

970
00:51:07.761 --> 00:51:10.870
<v Speaker 2>we do not have time travel yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so time as I know,</v>

971
00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:15.200
<v Speaker 2>no it is not yet in dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexuality however,</v>

972
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:16.063
<v Speaker 2>is somewhat of an abstract concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that there are male and female </v>

973
00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:20.894
<v Speaker 2>genitals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there is that concreteness of </v>

974
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:26.203
<v Speaker 2>biological sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I guess what the Trans people talk </v>

975
00:51:28.641 --> 00:51:30.560
<v Speaker 2>about is gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

976
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:32.930
<v Speaker 2>which is different and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

977
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.240
<v Speaker 2>and like we just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even the,</v>

978
00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:36.403
<v Speaker 2>even the biological aspect isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it definitely is a completely </v>

979
00:51:41.721 --> 00:51:42.554
<v Speaker 2>different beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he is trying to do this to make a </v>

980
00:51:45.111 --> 00:51:45.651
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

981
00:51:45.651 --> 00:51:48.050
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty weak argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So weak argument.</v>

982
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.040
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>

983
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

984
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:54.303
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fuck those old ladies to be like </v>

985
00:51:55.961 --> 00:51:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kyle,</v>

986
00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cougar Champs got no problem,</v>

987
00:51:59.981 --> 00:52:02.230
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets and he takes it for all of us.</v>

988
00:52:02.231 --> 00:52:03.064
<v Speaker 2>He's a young man and you are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lie on tinder about your age so you can </v>

989
00:52:06.071 --> 00:52:08.650
<v Speaker 2>fuck some 49 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cute little cuties,</v>

990
00:52:08.651 --> 00:52:11.990
<v Speaker 2>young cuties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

991
00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:13.443
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

992
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:17.080
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not right there.</v>

993
00:52:17.081 --> 00:52:17.914
<v Speaker 2>You have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be podcast spreading </v>

994
00:52:18.881 --> 00:52:23.500
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a wild story.</v>

995
00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:28.830
<v Speaker 2>So this American missionary who's trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to spread the word of God goes to a,</v>

996
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an island in a,</v>

997
00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:37.540
<v Speaker 2>in India that is blocked off from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>hue of humanity.</v>

998
00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:41.740
<v Speaker 2>And this tribe has lived there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolation for 55,000</v>

999
00:52:41.741 --> 00:52:42.574
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people estimate and the Indian </v>

1000
00:52:45.581 --> 00:52:47.650
<v Speaker 2>government protects this island because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1001
00:52:47.651 --> 00:52:48.484
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something beautiful </v>

1002
00:52:50.081 --> 00:52:50.980
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1003
00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.820
<v Speaker 2>they don't want any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't wash.</v>

1004
00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1005
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.823
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's something beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>about conserving that and just letting </v>

1006
00:53:00.851 --> 00:53:02.440
<v Speaker 2>them live in peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been,</v>

1007
00:53:02.441 --> 00:53:06.190
<v Speaker 2>people have attempted to go there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've always reacted violently as,</v>

1008
00:53:06.191 --> 00:53:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was reading an article that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1009
00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:10.293
<v Speaker 2>the British,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a British went to the island early </v>

1010
00:53:13.721 --> 00:53:17.950
<v Speaker 2>during their colonial days and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>decimated the population of the island.</v>

1011
00:53:17.951 --> 00:53:18.784
<v Speaker 2>And since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their original numbers have been </v>

1012
00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:21.723
<v Speaker 2>decimated and now they're still just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>small fraction of what the population </v>

1013
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:27.330
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're very guarded,</v>

1014
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.253
<v Speaker 2>justifiably from outsiders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this American missionary goes to </v>

1015
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.120
<v Speaker 2>India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me pull up this article.</v>

1016
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 2>He writes that he's going there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>tourism,</v>

1017
00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:43.281
<v Speaker 2>but its real purpose is that he wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread the message of Jesus and he knows</v>

1018
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.220
<v Speaker 2>is going against the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Preventing.</v>

1019
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indiana.</v>

1020
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>India prohibits,</v>

1021
00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:52.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibits visitors,</v>

1022
00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:54.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>

1023
00:53:54.121 --> 00:53:56.490
<v Speaker 2>he was killed by the natives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Let me read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoops.</v>

1025
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see here.</v>

1026
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:13.070
<v Speaker 2>John is said to have died and a hail of </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrows as he set foot on North Sentinel,</v>

1027
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:19.080
<v Speaker 2>sentinel island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the Indian controlled islands in</v>

1028
00:54:19.081 --> 00:54:19.914
<v Speaker 2>the Bay of Bengal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People live there or one of the few </v>

1029
00:54:21.481 --> 00:54:22.314
<v Speaker 2>tribes completely cut off from the rest </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world and have previously fired </v>

1030
00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:25.794
<v Speaker 2>at outsiders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The media here is really incredible and </v>

1031
00:54:28.731 --> 00:54:31.920
<v Speaker 2>these people are fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like here's someone off the coast,</v>

1032
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:33.680
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1033
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:37.610

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1034
00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Like when they see people off the coast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stand guard on the beach.</v>

1035
00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:44.960
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing what a trip.</v>

1036
00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:46.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1037
00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:52.190
<v Speaker 2>here's the island right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So really beautiful little cuddle land.</v>

1038
00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is incredible.</v>

1039
00:54:57.110 --> 00:54:59.420
<v Speaker 2>55,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years they've been there.</v>

1040
00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indian police confirm the death and said</v>

1041
00:55:04.971 --> 00:55:07.010
<v Speaker 2>local electronic engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simply,</v>

1042
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.420
<v Speaker 2>his name was Alexander.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1043
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:15.430
<v Speaker 2>he had locals and five fishermen took </v>
<v Speaker 2>him out to the island illegally.</v>

1044
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hired fishing a guys to get close and</v>

1045
00:55:24.361 --> 00:55:29.090
<v Speaker 2>he kayaked to the island from the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's some more footage of them.</v>

1046
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:33.270
<v Speaker 2>And this was like a known thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were hostile,</v>

1047
00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.320
<v Speaker 2>prohibited by the Indian government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're known hot.</v>

1048
00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fishermen knew that too.</v>

1049
00:55:39.631 --> 00:55:42.300
<v Speaker 2>And actually they're under arrest now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1050
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:43.021
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1051
00:55:43.021 --> 00:55:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Cause I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they broke the law,</v>

1052
00:55:44.131 --> 00:55:46.590
<v Speaker 2>taking him there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was attacked by arrows.</v>

1053
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:50.160
<v Speaker 2>But continued walking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not,</v>

1054
00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.800
<v Speaker 2>the fisherman saw the tribals trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rope.</v>

1055
00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.813
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fisherman saw the tribals tying a </v>

1056
00:55:55.171 --> 00:55:57.540
<v Speaker 2>rope around his neck and dragging his </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1057
00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.920
<v Speaker 2>They were scared and fled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but return next morning to find his body</v>

1058
00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:06.921
<v Speaker 2>on the seashore fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1059
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:16.910
<v Speaker 2>the people are banned from getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>within three miles of the island.</v>

1060
00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:21.240
<v Speaker 2>The island with an estimated population </v>
<v Speaker 2>of between 40 and 200.</v>

1063
00:56:27.641 --> 00:56:28.474
<v Speaker 2>contact with outsiders because they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>no immunity to common diseases like </v>

<v Speaker 2>fluent measles.</v>

<v Speaker 7>We made it you guys.</v>

1079
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:10.363
<v Speaker 2>On the evening of 14 November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the group of six pretending to be </v>

1080
00:57:12.741 --> 00:57:13.574
<v Speaker 2>fishing evaded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the patrolling police coast guard and </v>

1081
00:57:16.451 --> 00:57:17.284
<v Speaker 2>navy ships reaching the island at </v>
<v Speaker 2>midnight before Mr Chu Kayak to the </v>

1082
00:57:21.291 --> 00:57:22.124
<v Speaker 2>island in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please said the fishermen agreed a time </v>

1083
00:57:24.351 --> 00:57:26.120
<v Speaker 2>and place to meet each other near the </v>
<v Speaker 2>island.</v>

1084
00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.193
<v Speaker 2>On the morning of 17th November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they saw a dead person being buried at </v>

1085
00:57:30.891 --> 00:57:33.380
<v Speaker 2>the shore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which from the silhouette of the body,</v>

1086
00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:38.540
<v Speaker 2>clothing and circumstance appeared to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body of John Allen Choo.</v>

1087
00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:45.280
<v Speaker 2>This is an iconic photograph taken from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a helicopter after the 2004 tsunami,</v>

1088
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:46.583
<v Speaker 2>which apparently a day somehow survive </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this huge tsunami that this guy is </v>

1089
00:57:52.251 --> 00:57:53.084
<v Speaker 2>shooting a bow and Arrow at a helicopter</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're just so unacquainted </v>

1090
00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:01.550
<v Speaker 2>with the outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine what they would think.</v>

1091
00:58:01.551 --> 00:58:02.720
<v Speaker 2>What would you even think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1092
00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:04.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Terrifying.</v>

1093
00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Some gnarly bird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rightly.</v>

1094
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:09.783
<v Speaker 7>MMM.</v>

1095
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:12.070
<v Speaker 2>In a situation like this too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1096
00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:13.900
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the plan?</v>

1097
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to,</v>

1098
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.410
<v Speaker 2>you can't just give them bibles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't speak English,</v>

1099
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:22.440
<v Speaker 2>obviously wanting to explore and Tati he</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be the one guy that could reach to</v>

1100
00:58:23.081 --> 00:58:25.840
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing about these missionaries,</v>

1101
00:58:25.841 --> 00:58:28.900
<v Speaker 2>they believe that it comes from a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

1102
00:58:28.901 --> 00:58:29.734
<v Speaker 2>even though it's insane as they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the best thing you can do for </v>

1103
00:58:32.381 --> 00:58:37.381
<v Speaker 2>another person is give them Christianity</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they'll die.</v>

1104
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.550
<v Speaker 2>And internal torment trying to save.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just trying to save their soul.</v>

1105
00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to him,</v>

1106
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:45.130
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

1107
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:48.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to save these guys from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>from eternal torment.</v>

1108
00:58:48.731 --> 00:58:50.410
<v Speaker 2>They never even got the word of Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

1109
00:58:50.411 --> 00:58:55.411
<v Speaker 2>So how are they supposed to get saved?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he goes out there with the purest</v>

1110
00:58:55.571 --> 00:58:57.670
<v Speaker 2>of intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

1111
00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.960
<v Speaker 2>I will say for him at least he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck a kid.</v>

1112
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:10.950
<v Speaker 2>That's so bad joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is some thing nice to say about</v>

1113
00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:11.944
<v Speaker 2>him after all.</v>

1114
00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:13.453
<v Speaker 7>Mm.</v>

1115
00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty wild story though going too.</v>

1116
00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:23.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he clearly,</v>

1117
00:59:23.001 --> 00:59:25.530
<v Speaker 2>he knew what he was getting stuff into </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he hired a black,</v>

1118
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:27.570
<v Speaker 2>a black market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1119
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:31.820
<v Speaker 2>illegal fishermen to write his ass there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Kayak.</v>

1120
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.710
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to what I read,</v>

1121
00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:34.653
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was hails of arrows coming at him </v>

1122
00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.900
<v Speaker 2>and he continued to walk with Bible in </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

1123
00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.470
<v Speaker 2>It say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1124
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:44.800
<v Speaker 2>it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want me to go back?</v>

1125
00:59:44.801 --> 00:59:46.470
<v Speaker 2>I'll read that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1126
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:47.990
<v Speaker 2>and we're in those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Santa.</v>

1127
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:49.580
<v Speaker 2>I'll read the hell out of that shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1128
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:51.043
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1129
00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:54.413
<v Speaker 2>Mel Gibson could make a movie about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and in the movie the natives are </v>

1130
01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I'm here.</v>

1131
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:10.210
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1132
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:18.410
<v Speaker 2>he was attacked by Arrows but continued </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking.</v>

1133
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.510
<v Speaker 2>The fishermen said it's pressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

1134
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little brave heart moment.</v>

1135
01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there you have it pretty wild man.</v>

1136
01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Z American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's American.</v>

1137
01:00:36.991 --> 01:00:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

1138
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:41.700
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1139
01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.170
<v Speaker 2>it says John loved people and he loved </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1140
01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.890
<v Speaker 2>It was willing to give his life to share</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus with the people in North Center.</v>

1141
01:00:50.891 --> 01:00:51.724
<v Speaker 2>No island ever since high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And John wanted to go to that island to </v>

1142
01:00:58.081 --> 01:01:01.140
<v Speaker 2>share Jesus with indigenous people</v>

1143
01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:05.160
<v Speaker 3>or since high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like a longterm project for,</v>

1144
01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:06.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1145
01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.740
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that was kind of terrible state,</v>

1146
01:01:08.741 --> 01:01:10.640
<v Speaker 3>but it's really hard to sympathize with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy.</v>

1147
01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:11.523
<v Speaker 3>It's like you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you knew exactly what you were getting </v>

1148
01:01:15.221 --> 01:01:16.840
<v Speaker 3>yourself into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1149
01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:18.873
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At what point it's like you can go to </v>

1150
01:01:22.571 --> 01:01:24.790
<v Speaker 2>church and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at what point,</v>

1151
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:27.940
<v Speaker 2>at what point does a religion become </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane?</v>

1152
01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Like you can believe in the person is </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane,</v>

1153
01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:39.420
<v Speaker 2>but his defining characteristic is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he loved the God and that his whole life</v>

1154
01:01:40.541 --> 01:01:41.850
<v Speaker 2>was to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1155
01:01:41.851 --> 01:01:44.560
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a suicide then a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

1156
01:01:44.561 --> 01:01:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a martyr,</v>

1157
01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:51.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a mood or you know,</v>

1158
01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.990
<v Speaker 2>God loves martyrs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1159
01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.460
<v Speaker 3>there you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you said though,</v>

1160
01:01:59.461 --> 01:02:01.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean the point where it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it drips into,</v>

1161
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.880
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just fucked up,</v>

1162
01:02:02.881 --> 01:02:03.714
<v Speaker 3>is that there is the high likelihood </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to affect all these </v>

1163
01:02:06.721 --> 01:02:09.630
<v Speaker 3>people with measles or smallpox or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and wipe them out.</v>

1164
01:02:09.631 --> 01:02:10.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a nice,</v>

1165
01:02:10.651 --> 01:02:11.760
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of,</v>

1166
01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of fucked up at that point.</v>

1167
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like my only,</v>

1168
01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:20.370
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to get them a bible now if</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all die,</v>

1169
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:22.780
<v Speaker 2>it's okay right there saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

1170
01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all safe.</v>

1171
01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:25.614
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dug a little bit of arrogance little </v>

1172
01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:31.120
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel bad for the guy.</v>

1173
01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:33.100
<v Speaker 2>I wish them all the best in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterlife.</v>

1174
01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:33.943
<v Speaker 2>IOP is received well by God and that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>says you did my work and you save those </v>

<v Speaker 11>New York.</v>

1213
01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.173
<v Speaker 11>His presence,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they're bringing on year the outrage </v>

1214
01:04:36.531 --> 01:04:37.364
<v Speaker 11>from the surrounding community,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but this morning he's been deported to </v>

1215
01:04:39.411 --> 01:04:41.870
<v Speaker 11>Germany at the direct order of president</v>
<v Speaker 11>trump.</v>

1216
01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:47.740
<v Speaker 11>ABC News was there exclusively as ice </v>
<v Speaker 11>agents wield no.</v>

1217
01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:49.940
<v Speaker 11>At 95</v>

01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:51.103
<v Speaker 2>die like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the Germany and what you can't gave </v>

1219
01:04:54.761 --> 01:04:58.100
<v Speaker 2>him and get on a plane at 95 I mean that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy is going to not last long.</v>

1221
01:04:59.721 --> 01:05:00.554
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess the premise is that he's a </v>

1222
01:05:02.361 --> 01:05:03.194
<v Speaker 2>Nazi and he doesn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy deserves no dignity or comfort </v>

1223
01:05:07.011 --> 01:05:07.820
<v Speaker 2>or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1224
01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:08.653
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the premise they sent ice out </v>

1225
01:05:10.251 --> 01:05:15.251
<v Speaker 2>there for Christ's sake to wrap them up </v>

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:15.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like a show cause nothing's really </v>

<v Speaker 2>stories that he was just a guard.</v>

1251
01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what his involvement was </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily an n and the execution of,</v>

1252
01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:35.900
<v Speaker 2>of people during the Holocaust.</v>

1257
01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.570
<v Speaker 2>but the real question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 11>alleged role as an armed guard is a Nazi</v>

1262
01:06:57.341 --> 01:07:00.700
<v Speaker 11>death camp at the whole in decades after</v>
<v Speaker 11>his alleged involvement.</v>

1270
01:07:27.211 --> 01:07:28.044
<v Speaker 11>wasn't until 2003 that he was exposed as</v>

1304
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.033
<v Speaker 11>It's unclear what's next for him.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He's being detained by the German </v>

1305
01:09:25.051 --> 01:09:25.884
<v Speaker 11>government,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but they're still evaluating as legal </v>

1306
01:09:26.971 --> 01:09:29.760
<v Speaker 11>status since they don't consider him to </v>
<v Speaker 11>be a German citizen.</v>

01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:33.390
<v Speaker 11>So deported overnight future to be </v>

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.730
<v Speaker 11>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Hi everyone.</v>

1309
01:09:35.731 --> 01:09:36.564
<v Speaker 11>George.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Stephan,</v>

1310
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:38.500
<v Speaker 2>how about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1311
01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:41.180
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird one.</v>

1312
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:44.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a Nazi shit bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1313
01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:47.000
<v Speaker 2>clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also 95 years old.</v>

1314
01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:51.110
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you do?</v>

1315
01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:51.531
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1316
01:09:51.531 --> 01:09:53.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to feel about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm [inaudible],</v>

1317
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:54.703
<v Speaker 2>I'm ambivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see at this point what's </v>

1318
01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:02.840
<v Speaker 2>the point of doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1319
01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.470
<v Speaker 2>they should just throw him in a hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in prison.</v>

1320
01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like you know,</v>

1321
01:10:08.091 --> 01:10:08.924
<v Speaker 2>just the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like since it took this long </v>

1322
01:10:11.361 --> 01:10:14.060
<v Speaker 2>for them to report him and Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want him either.</v>

1323
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:18.290
<v Speaker 2>He basically is probably just going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend the rest of his life in,</v>

1324
01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:20.540
<v Speaker 2>in a camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of ironic.</v>

1325
01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is kind of a beautiful thing.</v>

1326
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Let's put them in a camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with it.</v>

1327
01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.850
<v Speaker 2>You go make them watch a b movie for all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of eternity.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Today we have an email from Ma Meechi </v>

01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:59.840
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big fan of the show.</v>

1337
01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.733
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1338
01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:01.880
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting ahead of myself.</v>

1339
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:05.580
<v Speaker 2>You want to watch the CEO of Papa John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's go to this fancy finishes.</v>

1340
01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy.</v>

1341
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.473
<v Speaker 2>Michi says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Honestly Ping in the sink is a </v>

1342
01:11:11.061 --> 01:11:14.760
<v Speaker 2>superior method than using a urinal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pros,</v>

1343
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.640
<v Speaker 2>you can save up to five liters of water </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't have to flush.</v>

1344
01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:19.440
<v Speaker 2>You can wash your hands while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

1345
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

1346
01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:23.070
<v Speaker 2>don't you finish pain before you wash </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hands.</v>

1347
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the point?</v>

1348
01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:25.043
<v Speaker 2>None of this makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you washing your hands while </v>

1349
01:11:27.901 --> 01:11:30.090
<v Speaker 2>you're paying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's you're not done with the act.</v>

1350
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.390
<v Speaker 2>The sink doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about,</v>

1351
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:34.253
<v Speaker 2>you haven't thought about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I washed my hands before Ip cause I </v>

1352
01:11:37.351 --> 01:11:38.610
<v Speaker 2>don't want to get my dick dirty.</v>

1353
01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>

1354
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Because the Dick has kind of a holy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my temple.</v>

1355
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a quarantine down there.</v>

1356
01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:53.963
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sink doesn't really get dirty </v>

1357
01:11:56.941 --> 01:11:57.774
<v Speaker 2>because you are cleaning it up while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're paying literally impossible to </v>

1358
01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:02.484
<v Speaker 2>miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have to worry about </v>

1359
01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:05.340
<v Speaker 2>cleaning up or even putting toilet seat </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1360
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Splash it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just something that I'm concerned about.</v>

1361
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:10.230
<v Speaker 2>It says not cleaning it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're paying in a sink,</v>

1362
01:12:10.231 --> 01:12:12.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a little drops of urine all over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place.</v>

1363
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Standing Upright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cons,</v>

1364
01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.070
<v Speaker 2>you have to properly clean the sink once</v>
<v Speaker 2>a week.</v>

1365
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:19.380
<v Speaker 2>That's disgusting Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once a week,</v>

1366
01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.040
<v Speaker 2>if somebody walks in on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are going to get kicked out of their</v>

1367
01:12:23.041 --> 01:12:25.250
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1368
01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.530
<v Speaker 2>well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with the premise of peeing in</v>

1369
01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:29.364
<v Speaker 2>the sink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I found a subreddit called sync </v>

1370
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:35.100
<v Speaker 2>pisters on know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is singularly,</v>

1371
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:36.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole subculture.</v>

1372
01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole community dedicated to the </v>

1373
01:12:39.721 --> 01:12:43.710
<v Speaker 2>glory of paying in a sink and from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sidebar that says,</v>

1374
01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.353
<v Speaker 2>don't ask yourself what the world needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask yourself what makes you come alive </v>

1375
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:50.124
<v Speaker 2>and go do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what the world needs is people </v>

1376
01:12:52.441 --> 01:12:53.274
<v Speaker 2>who have come alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about pissing in the </v>

1377
01:12:56.131 --> 01:12:59.310
<v Speaker 2>sink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One P is sterile.</v>

1378
01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:00.413
<v Speaker 2>Two sinks are unsterile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three people spit in the sink every day </v>

1379
01:13:04.141 --> 01:13:08.600
<v Speaker 2>and occasionally vomit there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't pee and my friend seek,</v>

1380
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:12.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't pee in the kitchen sink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I run the water while Ip.</v>

1381
01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never shit in the sink.</v>

1382
01:13:16.651 --> 01:13:17.484
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good,</v>

1383
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't pee in the sink when they're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year olds nearby.</v>

1384
01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't pee in the tub unless I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>showering in it.</v>

1385
01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.120
<v Speaker 2>If I noticed that NEP has missed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drain,</v>

1386
01:13:27.121 --> 01:13:29.540
<v Speaker 2>I wipe it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1387
01:13:29.541 --> 01:13:33.270
<v Speaker 2>I right off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the P is sterile thing.</v>

1388
01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm believe that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that gets repeated on you.</v>

1389
01:13:37.231 --> 01:13:38.064
<v Speaker 2>Look that up because I recently saw an </v>
<v Speaker 2>article saying that p is not actually </v>

1390
01:13:40.381 --> 01:13:44.640
<v Speaker 2>sterile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way PA's gross.</v>

1391
01:13:44.641 --> 01:13:45.421
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These gross,</v>

1392
01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:48.690
<v Speaker 2>we can all agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I've seen some porns.</v>

1393
01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:49.524
<v Speaker 2>Where do people don't think it's gross?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you can find everything is not </v>

1394
01:13:56.191 --> 01:13:58.740
<v Speaker 2>stale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stale or stare.</v>

1395
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.700
<v Speaker 2>It could be stale I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not sterile.</v>

1396
01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.210
<v Speaker 2>I keep the water running after I finish </v>
<v Speaker 2>peeing,</v>

1397
01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.810
<v Speaker 2>peeing in the sink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although more readily accomplished,</v>

1398
01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:11.070
<v Speaker 2>my mail is not in any way limited to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mail.</v>

1399
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:11.913
<v Speaker 2>Sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's one of the posts that I </v>

1400
01:14:13.841 --> 01:14:16.000
<v Speaker 2>looked at that really horrified me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1401
01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Which goes against the tenants of peaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this goes against the tenants of sync</v>

1402
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:22.683
<v Speaker 2>peers,</v>

1405
01:14:32.081 --> 01:14:36.550
<v Speaker 2>airplane toilet right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has gotta be ironic.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is people for real.</v>

1407
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.870

<v Speaker 2>Should,</v>

1408
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:43.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's hard to say it because the</v>

1409
01:14:43.691 --> 01:14:47.650
<v Speaker 2>post under it says heavy breathing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a picture of a sink.</v>

1410
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:49.263
<v Speaker 2>Slash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gear.</v>

1411
01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.140
<v Speaker 2>We were gang owned and see that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1412
01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Imagine pissing in the sink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piss her master race.</v>

1413
01:14:57.491 --> 01:14:58.324
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>

1414
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Imagine paying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to flush it.</v>

1415
01:15:04.211 --> 01:15:07.540
<v Speaker 2>This meme was made by Cinque p gang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1416
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:10.630
<v Speaker 2>well there you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1417
01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:12.810
<v Speaker 2>I think you should use a toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1418
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.010
<v Speaker 2>If you're asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he should use the toilet.</v>

1419
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may enjoy it and I'm,</v>

1420
01:15:17.521 --> 01:15:19.750
<v Speaker 2>I've peed in a sink before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to lie.</v>

1421
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it,</v>

1422
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:24.940
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've not made that one.</v>

1423
01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:29.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it was possibly that the which </v>
<v Speaker 2>sink.</v>

1424
01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it must have been first when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a kid,</v>

1425
01:15:32.681 --> 01:15:37.390
<v Speaker 2>just out of curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then another time probably,</v>

1426
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember if it was with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elo or different girlfriend,</v>

1427
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:41.403
<v Speaker 2>but we were both in the bathroom at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and she was on the toilet and I </v>

1428
01:15:43.601 --> 01:15:44.434
<v Speaker 2>peed in the sink.</v>

1429
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:48.720
<v Speaker 2>It may have been with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember something like that?</v>

1430
01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was you.</v>

1431
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:55.950
<v Speaker 2>It was a long fucking time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must've been like so long ago now.</v>

1432
01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like super drunk.</v>

1433
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we were drunk.</v>

1434
01:15:59.490 --> 01:16:02.400
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like an art gallery and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were drinking wine or some shit.</v>

1435
01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:05.490
<v Speaker 2>But regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1436
01:16:05.610 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1437
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:10.470
<v Speaker 2>we were drunk right off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is that yes,</v>

1438
01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.380
<v Speaker 2>we weren't thinking right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like something we would do.</v>

1439
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.050
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

1440
01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:20.400
<v Speaker 2>I cleaned up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't splash,</v>

1441
01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:23.970
<v Speaker 2>but I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying a splash could happen.</v>

1442
01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:25.493
<v Speaker 2>Splash does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all I'm saying is that why of it </v>

1443
01:16:29.141 --> 01:16:30.540
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At brush next to the sink.</v>

1444
01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:33.480
<v Speaker 2>There was no toothbrushes next to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sink and Bob,</v>

1445
01:16:33.481 --> 01:16:34.470
<v Speaker 2>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1446
01:16:34.471 --> 01:16:36.270
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1447
01:16:36.271 --> 01:16:37.104
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say that there's poop particles </v>

1448
01:16:38.281 --> 01:16:40.800
<v Speaker 2>found on most toothbrushing or you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

1449
01:16:40.801 --> 01:16:41.580
<v Speaker 2>look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

1450
01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:44.850
<v Speaker 2>We're fact checking who particles found </v>
<v Speaker 2>on most toothbrushes.</v>

1451
01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.250
<v Speaker 2>But I think that life is complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

1452
01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:53.880
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to be paying and sinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking over your shoulder.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>hair like that.</v>

1540
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.903
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not knowing that he's got a fade in </v>

1541
01:21:21.881 --> 01:21:23.350
<v Speaker 2>like a little pompadour curl.</v>

<v Speaker 2>walking out their haircut like that</v>

1544
01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.150
<v Speaker 13>curly,</v>
<v Speaker 13>luscious locks of amazingness.</v>

1547
01:21:38.201 --> 01:21:40.990
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I'm styling my hair like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1548
01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.760
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1549
01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:49.180
<v Speaker 2>you like my hair the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1550
01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I like it longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peewee Herman.</v>

1551
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:53.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>

1552
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:55.810
<v Speaker 2>let's go jerk off in a movie theater</v>

1553
01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:58.433
<v Speaker 13>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You think I should go see a stylist who </v>

1554
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:01.223
<v Speaker 13>understands curly hair?</v>
<v Speaker 13>He might need some type of relaxer or </v>

1555
01:22:04.050 --> 01:22:04.883
<v Speaker 13>Keratin treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Just to take a little bit of the curl </v>

1556
01:22:07.201 --> 01:22:08.034
<v Speaker 13>out of the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's going to relax the curl a little </v>

1557
01:22:09.661 --> 01:22:12.750
<v Speaker 13>bit more in terms of product.</v>
<v Speaker 13>He could probably get away with the Pete</v>

1558
01:22:12.751 --> 01:22:13.584
<v Speaker 13>and Pedro Cream,</v>
<v Speaker 13>which is a leave in conditioner or the </v>

1559
01:22:15.301 --> 01:22:18.000
<v Speaker 13>beat and Pedro paste that he's looking </v>
<v Speaker 13>for a little bit more.</v>

1560
01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:18.800
<v Speaker 13>Pedro.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everything he says he's brand new.</v>

1564
01:22:27.611 --> 01:22:30.630
<v Speaker 2>He's in their pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think it's his</v>

1565
01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:32.820
