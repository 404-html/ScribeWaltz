24
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.543
<v Speaker 1>A lot of controversy there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are talking about there's been a </v>

27
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 1>poison in their drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds a little far fetched.</v>

28
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it.</v>

37
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.050

<v Speaker 1>misconceptions going around.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of misconception </v>
<v Speaker 1>about I'm,</v>

47
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:29.404
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about my involvement with </v>

48
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:31.674
<v Speaker 1>better help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

50
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>let me start from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better help is a,</v>

51
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>an online therapy service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

52
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>which they've sponsored one of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast episodes a couple of months ago.</v>

54
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a lot of youtubers have been getting</v>

55
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:55.014
<v Speaker 1>criticized lately for having put better </v>
<v Speaker 1>help reads on their videos about mental </v>

56
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about them being depressed and such.</v>

57
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.973
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people have been accusing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them of being predatory because they're </v>

58
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:10.991
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

59
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm so depressed and here's better help.</v>

60
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.263
<v Speaker 1>They're accusing them of a exaggerating </v>
<v Speaker 1>their depression to sell better help or </v>

61
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>to go to better help sponsor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

62
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.383
<v Speaker 1>And then people started going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>their terms of service and found some </v>

63
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.430
<v Speaker 1>concerning things there as well of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>service itself.</v>

64
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.280
<v Speaker 1>In the terms of service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was something I,</v>

65
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly.</v>

66
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:33.874
<v Speaker 1>There was something like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't guarantee that your </v>

67
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>private stuff like that.</v>

68
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

69
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird stuff.</v>

70
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 1>And so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make clear,</v>

71
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

72
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.613
<v Speaker 1>we had one sponsor with better help that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was two months ago and the topic of </v>

73
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:53.554
<v Speaker 1>mental health was not brought up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>association with our read at all and to </v>

74
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:58.684
<v Speaker 1>the best of my recollection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that we even talked about </v>

75
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:01.024
<v Speaker 1>it in that episode and it predated our </v>
<v Speaker 1>update video when I talked about being </v>

76
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>depressed by month a month at least.</v>

77
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.283
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's where I think people got </v>

78
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:10.984
<v Speaker 1>thrown off because Pewdie pie made a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>video about it and he goes through the </v>

79
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>terms of service and he points out a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of questionable things,</v>

80
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:18.214
<v Speaker 1>which is fine and he doesn't like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>service and he raises good points about </v>

81
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:22.774
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way that he presented my </v>

82
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:25.954
<v Speaker 1>involvement in it I thought was a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>misleading and a little out of context </v>

83
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.360
<v Speaker 1>and it made it look like I was way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved with this company that I was.</v>

84
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.743
<v Speaker 1>Or even that it made it look like I used</v>
<v Speaker 1>my being depressed to somehow sell </v>

85
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.243
<v Speaker 1>better help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to show you guys if I could </v>

86
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.440
<v Speaker 1>please exhibit a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

87
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>This is beauty pies video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me go back a little bit.</v>

88
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's watch this.</v>

89
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.860
<v Speaker 1>So he goes on here and he's talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about here.</v>

90
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I was just joking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way guys,</v>

91
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.800
<v Speaker 2>everyone needs to sociopath enter the </v>
<v Speaker 2>code.</v>

92
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Shane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your cheaper online therapy to date,</v>

93
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.100
<v Speaker 2>I would never have guessed it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually this was the case.</v>

94
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 2>So this leads to a lot of the sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos of these 100,</v>

95
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 2>100 of Youtube ers being about mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

96
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.000
<v Speaker 2>which could actually be a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are made so that people sign up</v>

97
00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:22.770
<v Speaker 2>for the website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Scott.</v>

98
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 2>It's Scott from depression to </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>

99
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.333
<v Speaker 1>So he's saying there's all these you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tubers that are promoting better health </v>

100
00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:30.080
<v Speaker 1>on videos about depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a problem with that.</v>

101
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.960
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't think that that's ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

102
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.980
<v Speaker 1>here's what he shows here.</v>

103
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.220
<v Speaker 2>If you're looking for anything to miss </v>
<v Speaker 2>out on,</v>

104
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 2>don't miss out on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to expression.</v>

105
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.053
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually messed up there and </v>

106
00:05:44.841 --> 00:05:45.674
<v Speaker 2>completely serious before we start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have so much respect for each and </v>

107
00:05:49.971 --> 00:05:50.804
<v Speaker 2>every one of you for watching and being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you ask for my payment </v>

108
00:05:52.821 --> 00:05:54.350
<v Speaker 2>information now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

109
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>As we know have been in therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been</v>

110
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v Speaker 1>just dealing with a lot of stuff that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to deal with and I feel good </v>

111
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel good.</v>

112
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what is that probably about so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can access professional,</v>

113
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>affordable and convenient counseling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just hit a wall where it was.</v>

114
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.383
<v Speaker 1>It has gotten so bad that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically either stop making videos or </v>

115
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

116
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 1>this video is sponsored by better </v>
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>

117
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:20.623
<v Speaker 1>more information about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the way it's cut makes it look like </v>

118
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.693
<v Speaker 1>my video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My update video was sponsored by better </v>

119
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>health and that's what I felt when I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>

120
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought it was.</v>

121
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.861
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

122
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:34.694
<v Speaker 1>like why would that be there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gives totally the wrong impression </v>

123
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 1>because I've never talked about better </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and depression.</v>

124
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Ever fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I did the sponsoree two months ago,</v>

125
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even endorse the product </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have never used the service.</v>

126
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.963
<v Speaker 1>We checked it to make sure we checked it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that within 24 hours a </v>

127
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:56.204
<v Speaker 1>therapist contacted us and they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we did some due diligence in that </v>

128
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>regard to test out the service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never endorsed it.</v>

129
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I never said that I used it to treat my </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression either,</v>

130
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 1>but it seemed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at any rate,</v>

131
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:06.981
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me say,</v>

132
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>focus on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

133
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.393
<v Speaker 1>that seems like the only reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion to make is that he's calling </v>

134
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:16.610
<v Speaker 1>me out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

135
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

136
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:18.750
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

137
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty upset with him and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>contacted him directly and I was like,</v>

138
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:24.860
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

139
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the deal?</v>

140
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.923
<v Speaker 1>And he says he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't mean to make it look that way </v>

141
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.063
<v Speaker 1>and he made a comment trying to clarify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the people that read the comments </v>

142
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 1>compared to the people that watched the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video is very small.</v>

143
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened here is that,</v>

144
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Burns,</v>

145
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.433
<v Speaker 1>this youtuber here made a video about </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression that's sponsored by better </v>

146
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:55.721
<v Speaker 1>help and he uses my clip in it talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about depression.</v>

147
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me show you this anymore videos.</v>

148
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.123
<v Speaker 1>I just hit a wall where it was gotten so</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad that it was basically either stop </v>

149
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 1>making videos or disappear forever.</v>

150
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 1>So today's video is going to be about </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube happiness.</v>

151
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>We're get started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you hit that notification.</v>

152
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Bell lets you know whenever I upload new</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos also,</v>

153
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:20.804
<v Speaker 1>this video is sponsored by Dell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll notice that it's from bobby's </v>

154
00:08:24.051 --> 00:08:24.884
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he cut out the context so to </v>

155
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>understand either way because the part </v>
<v Speaker 1>in pdfs video,</v>

156
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.353
<v Speaker 1>it's just kinda like a super cut of </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of like it doesn't really </v>

157
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:41.000
<v Speaker 1>inform the Butler affordable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>convenient counseling.</v>

158
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.013
<v Speaker 1>I just hit a wall but I think he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do it on purpose but I just </v>

159
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:47.880
<v Speaker 1>want to clarify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:48.763
<v Speaker 1>because it makes sense to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't make a difference to make a </v>

161
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 1>connection between being depressed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then from a company we didn't want to do</v>

162
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:57.894
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my personal choice that we made </v>

163
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.893
<v Speaker 1>so that it was kind of so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that [inaudible] who's the </v>

164
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>biggest youtuber in the world talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

165
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:10.690
<v Speaker 1>people take it seriously and it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>

166
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I interpret it.</v>

167
00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:13.484
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a lot of other people that </v>

168
00:09:14.961 --> 00:09:17.570
<v Speaker 1>saw it that way too and it just seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

169
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 1>But you can see that basically either so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't seem to know more information</v>

170
00:09:28.631 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 1>about that at the end of this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

171
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:36.010
<v Speaker 1>then he goes on to to criticize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticize a lot of youtubers.</v>

172
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.990
<v Speaker 1>He also doesn't really criticize them </v>
<v Speaker 1>harshly,</v>

173
00:09:40.991 --> 00:09:45.991
<v Speaker 1>is more criticizing this service of </v>
<v Speaker 1>better help names.</v>

174
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.890
<v Speaker 1>He names a lot of people and he shows a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of faces of people and you know,</v>

175
00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.050
<v Speaker 1>when you're Pewdie Pie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect of that is that.</v>

176
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

177
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.450
<v Speaker 1>he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very tempered in his criticism.</v>

178
00:09:58.451 --> 00:10:01.150
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't like coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was being very.</v>

179
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.340
<v Speaker 1>He was being very rational and fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

180
00:10:03.341 --> 00:10:04.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying,</v>

181
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.283
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to clear that up that that </v>

182
00:10:06.311 --> 00:10:08.830
<v Speaker 1>video was not in any way sponsored by </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

183
00:10:08.831 --> 00:10:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've only worked with them once so.</v>

184
00:10:11.081 --> 00:10:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But regardless of that,</v>

185
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.673
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty weird that bobby </v>
<v Speaker 1>used that clip anyway because I keep </v>

186
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:22.261
<v Speaker 1>seeing that clip going around of bobby </v>
<v Speaker 1>using my clip talking about depression,</v>

187
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.930
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a clear separation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people think that.</v>

188
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me just see here.</v>

189
00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:34.404
<v Speaker 1>I've got so</v>

190
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.880
<v Speaker 1>in response to the criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

191
00:10:38.881 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I just want to make that clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

192
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.303
<v Speaker 1>Now in response to their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there was some implication </v>

193
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:49.200
<v Speaker 1>that anyone that works with better help </v>
<v Speaker 1>is negligent,</v>

194
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.490
<v Speaker 1>a shill or irresponsible or somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling out their fans.</v>

195
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 1>And even though I never mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

196
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:01.130
<v Speaker 1>am I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do disagree with that assertion.</v>

197
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I do personally disagree with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>assertion.</v>

198
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Now let me talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what.</v>

199
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.900
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what I could do to vet them</v>

200
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 1>more than I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a perfect world,</v>

201
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:14.364
<v Speaker 1>I liked the service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems interesting and it seems like </v>

202
00:11:15.911 --> 00:11:19.050
<v Speaker 1>it would be useful for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like on face value.</v>

203
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.003
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a cool service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're owned by a publicly traded </v>

204
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:23.664
<v Speaker 1>company and they're one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>widely advertised services on the </v>

205
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:27.660
<v Speaker 1>internet across television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio,</v>

206
00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:28.830
<v Speaker 1>podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Youtube,</v>

207
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:30.923
<v Speaker 1>so with all the information available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a perfectly rational decision to </v>

208
00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:38.400
<v Speaker 1>think that it's a good useful service </v>
<v Speaker 1>and something that's good,</v>

209
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.860
<v Speaker 1>good to promote and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

210
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:41.694
<v Speaker 1>these guys are going through the terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of service and picking it apart and </v>

211
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:46.800
<v Speaker 1>there's weird questionable stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

212
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think like this.</v>

213
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.653
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird standard to make that you </v>

214
00:11:52.861 --> 00:11:53.694
<v Speaker 1>want the slit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expectation that anyone you ever </v>

215
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:57.004
<v Speaker 1>work with your reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire 20 page legal document of a </v>

216
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 1>terms of service like I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>

217
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.913
<v Speaker 1>Very few people in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube have ever read the terms of </v>

218
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>service and I'm willing to bet that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did read the terms of service,</v>

219
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:09.784
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't want to work with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because terms of service is written to </v>

220
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Speaker 1>remove liability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it always sounds bad.</v>

221
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Terminal Service is meant to sound bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and scary.</v>

222
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 1>They're literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purpose is to remove liability,</v>

223
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.290
<v Speaker 1>so to expect youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a slippery slope.</v>

224
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.100
<v Speaker 1>If you are expecting everyone to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>the terms of service,</v>

225
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:30.910
<v Speaker 1>every partner that I've ever worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

226
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

227
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.990
<v Speaker 1>on face value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as reputable as a,</v>

228
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 1>as a partner as you can.</v>

229
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had some offers for responses that</v>

230
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:43.350
<v Speaker 3>we declined that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But someone like better help,</v>

231
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.910
<v Speaker 3>like past all the questions that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would normally ask,</v>

232
00:12:47.911 --> 00:12:50.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is they do have good reviews online when</v>

233
00:12:50.881 --> 00:12:51.714
<v Speaker 3>we looked up.</v>

234
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

235
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:56.440
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people can promote people decide how</v>

236
00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:57.274
<v Speaker 1>they want to promote different products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally wasn't comfortable </v>

237
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:00.394
<v Speaker 1>promoting it in terms of me being </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and I wasn't personally </v>

238
00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 1>comfortable saying I've used the service</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I haven't,</v>

239
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 1>but it seemed good and it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be useful and helpful.</v>

240
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:12.220
<v Speaker 1>So I promoted it as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

241
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are just a little too </v>

242
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:22.531
<v Speaker 1>quick to throw others under the bus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>be way overly cynical about this.</v>

243
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

244
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.253
<v Speaker 1>I understand that it can seem in poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>taste to promote better help in a video </v>

245
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:31.954
<v Speaker 1>about being depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't do for the record and I </v>

246
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 1>have never done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But from the flip side,</v>

247
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:39.950
<v Speaker 1>think about it from their perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone like,</v>

248
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>like buggy felt the Franco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Burns,</v>

249
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:45.184
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane,</v>

250
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.910
<v Speaker 1>everyone think of it from their side </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of being so cynical and thinking</v>

251
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:51.100
<v Speaker 1>that there is this elaborate scam to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

252
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a win win.</v>

253
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

254
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>this app is going to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a good service.</v>

255
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.560
<v Speaker 1>And my videos promoted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

256
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be optimistic about it and it feels like</v>

257
00:14:03.211 --> 00:14:03.851
<v Speaker 1>a one one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

258
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:07.930
<v Speaker 1>that's how sponsors as young Youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always worked like content,</v>

259
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.420
<v Speaker 1>like sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have video game content,</v>

260
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.960
<v Speaker 1>you have a video game sponsorship on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make car content,</v>

261
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.280
<v Speaker 1>our tech content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have technology or car,</v>

262
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like content,</v>

263
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:19.540
<v Speaker 1>like sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>

264
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.970
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy to see where people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from,</v>

265
00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>thinking that it's okay to pair those </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

266
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.540
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a win win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

267
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.280
<v Speaker 1>and so I completely understand where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're coming from.</v>

268
00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think once again,</v>

269
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:38.853
<v Speaker 1>people are thinking about it backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what has been happening is that </v>

270
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:45.304
<v Speaker 1>better help because there's been this </v>
<v Speaker 1>implication that people have </v>

271
00:14:47.531 --> 00:14:48.364
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being depressed to sell better help as </v>

272
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>that is a very powerful.</v>

273
00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.223
<v Speaker 1>It really shitty that would be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty and the people that I've seen </v>

274
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.733
<v Speaker 1>being called out are people that I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had a history with mental health </v>

275
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:03.853
<v Speaker 1>issues and so I think it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ironic to like real and dog pile on </v>

276
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 1>these people who already kind of fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

277
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.823
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what I think you guys have it </v>

278
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 1>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who are being overly cynical,</v>

279
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.923
<v Speaker 1>people who have spoken about mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>health issues are the people that are </v>

280
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:24.250
<v Speaker 1>being approached by better health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

281
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.573
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't start from wanting to sell </v>

282
00:15:29.391 --> 00:15:30.224
<v Speaker 1>better help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts from having these issues and </v>

283
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 1>then better help comes in because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>see an opportunity.</v>

284
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how these partnerships </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a happened.</v>

285
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.043
<v Speaker 1>And then finally I've heard this </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument that it's unethical for you </v>

286
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:50.681
<v Speaker 1>tubers to even make money from promoting</v>
<v Speaker 1>a service about mental health.</v>

287
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.880
<v Speaker 1>That I heard that it's unethical to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>money for it,</v>

288
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.490
<v Speaker 1>that it should be done for free even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I.</v>

289
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who benefits from doing it for free?</v>

290
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.623
<v Speaker 1>Better help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to do free copyrights </v>

291
00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 1>for better help their business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

292
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.570
<v Speaker 1>as a capitalist society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way the world turns.</v>

293
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.873
<v Speaker 1>I mean saying it's illogical for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>utuber are immoral for youtube or to </v>

294
00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:23.110
<v Speaker 1>collect money to promote better health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

295
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.210
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is similar to saying it,</v>

296
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.403
<v Speaker 1>is it a moral for a doctor or therapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>or nurse to get paid for their work </v>

297
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.650
<v Speaker 1>because it benefits people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a capitalist society.</v>

298
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:37.610
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

299
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.830
<v Speaker 1>This is how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point,</v>

300
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:40.773
<v Speaker 1>where does the red line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point does it become a moral </v>

301
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:43.783
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's therapists the charge $50 an </v>

302
00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:47.570
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$200 an hour,</v>

303
00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 1>$500 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At what point does it become immoral for</v>

304
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:54.170
<v Speaker 1>therapists to charge $50 an hour?</v>

305
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.110
<v Speaker 1>$500 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's service not valuable.</v>

306
00:16:57.111 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Is that not a capital is not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commodity.</v>

307
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

308
00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 1>If they're better at it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they not deserve to get paid more.</v>

309
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.013
<v Speaker 1>So this blanket statement that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow immoral to sponsor online </v>

310
00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:14.480
<v Speaker 1>therapy strikes me as an odd one and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that makes much sense.</v>

311
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Especially considering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

312
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>here in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our costs spittles are doctors.</v>

313
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Everything Cancer Treatment for Christ </v>
<v Speaker 1>sake is heavily monetized.</v>

314
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.320
<v Speaker 1>And I personally find that to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgraceful.</v>

315
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.810
<v Speaker 1>But are we saying that they shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get paid at all?</v>

316
00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.090
<v Speaker 1>They should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They volunteer.</v>

317
00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

318
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.303
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an argument that doesn't make much </v>

319
00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:41.780
<v Speaker 1>sense to you and it falls apart in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind when you try to break it down.</v>

320
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice,</v>

321
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.293
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really make that much </v>

322
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:46.850
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

323
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:49.500
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to acknowledge this is somebody I</v>

324
00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:53.400
<v Speaker 1>worked with one time months ago and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>never promoted them and context of being</v>

325
00:17:53.401 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 1>depressed and I never said that I used </v>
<v Speaker 1>their service to treat my depression.</v>

326
00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not journalist.</v>

327
00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my opinion.</v>

328
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.003
<v Speaker 1>Feel free to disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been watching this kind of </v>

329
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.084
<v Speaker 1>devolve and I think that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being way overly cynical about this and </v>

330
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 1>it's just another example of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

331
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:18.863
<v Speaker 1>it just feels like one of these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just making youtube even more </v>

332
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:25.620
<v Speaker 1>toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even more distrustful of people and</v>

333
00:18:25.621 --> 00:18:30.621
<v Speaker 1>even more cynical of each other and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and I just don't know why and and</v>

334
00:18:31.191 --> 00:18:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

335
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.350
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't feel right.</v>

336
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 1>This whole thing and sure some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are being opportunistic.</v>

337
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.233
<v Speaker 1>Probably some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not always going to happen to </v>

338
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:43.900
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's,</v>

339
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.753
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of controversy about </v>
<v Speaker 1>filter Franco because he was apparently </v>

340
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.243
<v Speaker 1>sponsor with them and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about what filter </v>

341
00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Franco's up to not commenting at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

342
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.350
<v Speaker 1>And I know like he had a bank connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow with Shane's better help.</v>

343
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Sponsorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not connected to us at all.</v>

344
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Ours came through an agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let me say this,</v>

345
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:06.570
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you work with sponsors,</v>

346
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 1>we work with a lot of sponsors here on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast.</v>

347
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.730
<v Speaker 1>They come through agencies that vet </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

348
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:12.763
<v Speaker 1>the check for their credibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collect payments and make sure </v>

349
00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:15.780
<v Speaker 1>they're legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

350
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

351
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.343
<v Speaker 1>so obviously we as business owners and </v>
<v Speaker 1>as entertainers are not going to read </v>

352
00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 1>the terms of service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of our partners.</v>

353
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:25.740
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has time for that.</v>

354
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.813
<v Speaker 1>So we trust our agency to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to verify the legitimacy of these </v>

355
00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:34.710
<v Speaker 1>companies and I don't think they failed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case.</v>

356
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean we think about it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't just pass the buck completely to</v>

357
00:19:37.391 --> 00:19:39.960
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make a conscious decision to work with</v>

358
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.360
<v Speaker 1>someone or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this case I don't regret it.</v>

359
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

360
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:47.040
<v Speaker 1>there's some questionable things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of service,</v>

361
00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:47.874
<v Speaker 1>but let me say this with the information</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had at the time I made the right </v>

362
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:51.774
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

363
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:52.953
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

364
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.340
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

365
00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.480
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

366
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I think if you want to criticize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

367
00:19:58.121 --> 00:19:59.920
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing and that's totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

368
00:19:59.921 --> 00:20:03.520
<v Speaker 1>but to come at Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Er's who have worked with them</v>

369
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.920
<v Speaker 1>seems overly cynical and toxic and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not.</v>

370
00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not necessary.</v>

371
00:20:11.361 --> 00:20:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you guys,</v>

372
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.440
<v Speaker 1>another crutch of this argument is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>implication that people don't.</v>

373
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.130
<v Speaker 1>There's so many sponsors available on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube now.</v>

374
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to act depressed to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsor on youtube.</v>

375
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.490
<v Speaker 1>You really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

376
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes it.</v>

377
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.143
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole thing just made me feel </v>

378
00:20:31.971 --> 00:20:35.300
<v Speaker 1>really sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt really bad.</v>

379
00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:36.134
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I saw Felix is video and kind of </v>

380
00:20:37.841 --> 00:20:39.740
<v Speaker 1>the way it was portrayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna lie,</v>

381
00:20:39.741 --> 00:20:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I felt it felt really awful and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean to do it,</v>

382
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:44.203
<v Speaker 1>but like I didn't want people to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people were getting the </v>

383
00:20:46.761 --> 00:20:47.594
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people went in and I felt bad </v>

384
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:51.454
<v Speaker 1>for all the other people he named two </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like these are people that </v>

385
00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:58.140
<v Speaker 1>are already sensitive and dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and it's like.</v>

386
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:59.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

387
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just overly cynical.</v>

388
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.500
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I chose not to talk about my depression.</v>

389
00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.330
<v Speaker 1>People make decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do that,</v>

390
00:21:11.331 --> 00:21:12.164
<v Speaker 1>but that's just my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can feel free to disagree with me </v>

391
00:21:14.541 --> 00:21:15.560
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

392
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.040
<v Speaker 1>We can have dissenting opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to come fucking murder my</v>

393
00:21:19.041 --> 00:21:19.874
<v Speaker 1>family and shit down my throat because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to have my own opinion about </v>

394
00:21:22.341 --> 00:21:23.174
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think youtube has gotten way too </v>

395
00:21:25.011 --> 00:21:29.510
<v Speaker 1>fucking toxic way to overly cynical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start throwing good,</v>

396
00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.430
<v Speaker 1>honest youtubers under the bus</v>

397
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.440
<v Speaker 1>that I think there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to reel it back a little</v>

398
00:21:37.441 --> 00:21:38.640
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

399
00:21:38.641 --> 00:21:39.474
<v Speaker 1>there's some that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that people shouldn't be </v>

400
00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:44.070
<v Speaker 1>criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

401
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just whatever just felt bad.</v>

402
00:21:49.711 --> 00:21:53.250
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing felt bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

403
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:54.960
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my take.</v>

404
00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:00.450
<v Speaker 1>And I hope that you won't come to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>house at 3:00</v>

405
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:05.450
<v Speaker 1>AM and attempt to murder me over on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissenting opinion because it's not that</v>

406
00:22:08.001 --> 00:22:10.250
<v Speaker 1>serious after all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you.</v>

407
00:22:10.251 --> 00:22:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And if you are thinking that you may </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider hopping over to [inaudible] dot</v>

00:22:31.181 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to stir the pot.</v>

416
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of feeling like everyone is </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We worked on it for like two weeks and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would just sit down and edit and enjoy </v>

579
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:11.590
<v Speaker 1>the experience and the sketch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

580
00:31:11.591 --> 00:31:15.580
<v Speaker 1>So I think that I really enjoyed and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reception was amazing.</v>

581
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone was really happy about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

582
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.813
<v Speaker 1>I got to say I didn't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I saw one complaints </v>

583
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:24.820
<v Speaker 1>actually have a collection of them for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

584

<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to do it.</v>

586
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.943
<v Speaker 1>There's no complaints guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we sit over in the Gazebo and </v>

587
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:40.440
<v Speaker 1>it felt good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think me and Isla realized,</v>

588
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I think recently we felt Ngozi boys </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the boys.</v>

589
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.360
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That feels special.</v>

590
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Are you a busy boy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Z Boys?</v>

591
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should name our child </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

592
00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.593
<v Speaker 1>but that's a good like gender neutral </v>
<v Speaker 1>name because just given birth under a </v>

593
00:32:01.811 --> 00:32:03.010
<v Speaker 1>gazebo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

594
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:07.810
<v Speaker 1>how people have all these weird like </v>
<v Speaker 1>given water waterpool a gazebo.</v>

595
00:32:07.811 --> 00:32:12.811
<v Speaker 1>Birth a blessing because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful thing.</v>

596
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

597
00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some people echoing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentiment that I,</v>

598
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.713
<v Speaker 1>I have spoken a lot of times that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be making videos like </v>

599
00:32:21.971 --> 00:32:22.804
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like recently I have always </v>

600
00:32:25.211 --> 00:32:26.044
<v Speaker 1>wanted to go back to making videos like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and just until recently we weren't </v>

601
00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:33.770
<v Speaker 1>meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

602
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I mean,</v>

603
00:32:35.141 --> 00:32:37.300
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just that I,</v>

604
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally couldn't.</v>

605
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.003
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but recently we really felt like we </v>

606
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:46.670
<v Speaker 1>wanted to try and go back to making like</v>
<v Speaker 1>high quality.</v>

607
00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.440
<v Speaker 3>I feel like they can embrace for like we</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't make a video.</v>

608
00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:50.283
<v Speaker 3>It's like three months and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>started to crave the feeling of like </v>

609
00:32:53.141 --> 00:32:54.820
<v Speaker 3>being creative and doing something.</v>

610
00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:55.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was born from that we </v>

611
00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.510
<v Speaker 1>really wanted to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

612
00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.010
<v Speaker 1>let's make the best video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can not cut any corners.</v>

613
00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.570
<v Speaker 1>There's no deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what we did.</v>

614
00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

615
00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I loved everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully more to come.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Avenue effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll be there for about an hour or </v>

<v Speaker 1>two and got the new rip indep </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection.</v>

639
00:34:26.711 --> 00:34:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Co Lab coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very excited about.</v>

640
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:31.510
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes there and um,</v>

641
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.360
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Lacroix poison?</v>

642
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.080
<v Speaker 1>That is the question we are looking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolve today.</v>

643
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Who are the players at work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who benefits from this?</v>

644
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Before we get into this lacroix boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

645
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.173
<v Speaker 1>under the Gazebo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A story I'd like to say cheers to </v>

646
00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:50.960
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the boys and back to enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

647
00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:51.794
<v Speaker 1>Crack Open Your Lacroix and have a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>refreshing sip of all natural essence </v>

648
00:34:55.191 --> 00:34:56.024
<v Speaker 1>sodie pop.</v>

649
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:59.203
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a new lawsuit alleges that a lacroix </v>

650
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:12.940
<v Speaker 1>is not all natural and the chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>limonene in Lacroix is also an cockroach</v>

651
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.030
<v Speaker 1>insecticide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

652
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:18.043
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all when I heard that is just </v>

653
00:35:19.491 --> 00:35:22.370
<v Speaker 1>because it's toxic to cockroaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't necessarily mean anything.</v>

654
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:24.510
<v Speaker 1>You hear shit like that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like our neighbors,</v>

655
00:35:24.511 --> 00:35:25.640
<v Speaker 1>the vet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

656
00:35:25.641 --> 00:35:27.890
<v Speaker 1>chewing gum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial sweetening,</v>

657
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:28.724
<v Speaker 1>chewing gum is deadly poisonous to dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because it's toxic to cockroach </v>

658
00:35:33.591 --> 00:35:35.360
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

659
00:35:35.361 --> 00:35:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Seems like an effort to scare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's dangerous to humans,</v>

660
00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:41.004
<v Speaker 1>say that it's dangerous to cockroaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cockroaches are gross and I have a </v>

661
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:48.930
<v Speaker 1>mental image of dead cockroaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't necessarily mean anything</v>

662
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:49.764
<v Speaker 1>besides that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that seems kind of manipulative </v>

663
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:52.650
<v Speaker 1>headline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at first something,</v>

664
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:54.950
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

665
00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:00.090
<v Speaker 1>is this really about the ingredients or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else at play?</v>

666
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.973
<v Speaker 1>So let's actually break down these </v>
<v Speaker 1>claims from the lawsuit who were making </v>

667
00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:04.914
<v Speaker 1>these claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

668
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 1>let's start with the chemical Lemo Nini.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I saying that right?</v>

669
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Or am I just sound like an idiot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A feeling?</v>

670
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.120
<v Speaker 1>You're not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could I?</v>

671
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:13.043
<v Speaker 1>It cannot be called limonene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then somebody for Christ sake help </v>

672
00:36:16.831 --> 00:36:19.770
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll check gleam on any line.</v>

673
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.200
<v Speaker 1>One nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Lima nine.</v>

674
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.083
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds way more intelligent in </v>

675
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.290
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm so bad at pronounciating things.</v>

676
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:29.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alignment nine,</v>

677
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Lima nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

678
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.273
<v Speaker 1>You killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just read it like someone from </v>

679
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:35.140
<v Speaker 1>outside of the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it?</v>

680
00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.083
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

681
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.270
<v Speaker 1>My brain is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pub cam,</v>

682
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.343
<v Speaker 1>the National Institutes of health open </v>
<v Speaker 1>database for chemical compounds </v>

683
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:44.903
<v Speaker 1>explicitly calls Lima Nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a naturally occurring chemical and a </v>

684
00:36:49.371 --> 00:36:53.910
<v Speaker 1>major component of oil extraction from </v>
<v Speaker 1>citrus peels.</v>

685
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.390
<v Speaker 1>So sounds pretty natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

686
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.823
<v Speaker 1>As the name suggests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>limonene is commonly used to give food </v>

687
00:37:02.581 --> 00:37:06.360
<v Speaker 1>or other products a lemony flavor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragrance.</v>

688
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.640
<v Speaker 1>So it is a naturally occurring compound </v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes off of lemons.</v>

689
00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.440
<v Speaker 1>So Lima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lima Damn crushed it.</v>

690
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:16.283
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking spelling bee champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how about the claims that it causes </v>

691
00:37:21.631 --> 00:37:22.464
<v Speaker 1>kidney toxicity and cancer while the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same company pub cam also states there </v>

692
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:31.701
<v Speaker 1>is inadequate evidence in humans for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>carcinogenic properties have limonene.</v>

693
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:33.103
<v Speaker 1>There is some evidence of male rats </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing problems including tumors </v>

694
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.153
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of limonene exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But none of those findings have been </v>

695
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 1>properly reproduced in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

696
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:51.030
<v Speaker 1>more recent study suggests that limonene</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually anti cancer.</v>

697
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.140
<v Speaker 1>It's lemon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a naturally occurring lemon.</v>

698
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.153
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did this company come to claim that </v>

699
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:03.240
<v Speaker 1>it's even unnatural?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was reading that the FDA,</v>

700
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.050
<v Speaker 1>because everything that FDA does is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>nebulous and undefined,</v>

701
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:12.350
<v Speaker 1>defines for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lemo nene as artificial flavor.</v>

702
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.183
<v Speaker 1>But according to this magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what the reason is for </v>

703
00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:20.154
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a naturally occurring chemical </v>

704
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.960
<v Speaker 1>that comes from lemon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

705
00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Now the other chemical that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>accused of being toxic is Lena Lou.</v>

706
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:32.521
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

707
00:38:32.521 --> 00:38:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Why can I not really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

708
00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:34.704
<v Speaker 1>Lou,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's spelled L I n a l o l that's a </v>

709
00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:38.254
<v Speaker 1>goofy ass word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lena Lou as another additive used as a </v>

710
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:46.750
<v Speaker 1>flavoring agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's naturally occurring.</v>

711
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Found within many types of flowers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spice plants,</v>

712
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.290
<v Speaker 1>including the nights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

713
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.770
<v Speaker 1>It includes meant centered herbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laurels,</v>

714
00:38:56.771 --> 00:38:57.604
<v Speaker 1>and cinnamon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is most definitely used an </v>

715
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:02.290
<v Speaker 1>insecticide as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That part is true,</v>

716
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.450
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean it's poisonous to </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

717
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.130
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I pointed out,</v>

718
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:09.310
<v Speaker 1>dogs can eat chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get I eat 20 bars a day.</v>

719
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Explain that you can't.</v>

720
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:20.170
<v Speaker 1>The only real toxic effects of Lena Lou </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been documented to inflict on humans</v>

721
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:24.490
<v Speaker 1>is mild skin and eye irritation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely from air assault,</v>

722
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.700
<v Speaker 1>from air forms of the chemical being </v>
<v Speaker 1>supported in your eyes.</v>

723
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:28.880
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take 11.</v>

724
00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Squirt it in your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

725
00:39:30.161 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sue the lemon people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

726
00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:33.820
<v Speaker 1>that's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Folks.</v>

727
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coincidentally,</v>

728
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:36.843
<v Speaker 1>research suggests that it may be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anticancer ingredient that leaves only </v>

729
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:42.963
<v Speaker 1>lionel prop property such as Lionel </v>
<v Speaker 1>property and a proper proper property </v>

730
00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.090
<v Speaker 1>and a like back in fifth grade trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>read again,</v>

731
00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:02.470
<v Speaker 1>read to the class even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you read a paragraph in front of the</v>

732
00:40:02.471 --> 00:40:03.304
<v Speaker 1>class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

733
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember half these words.</v>

734
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.420
<v Speaker 1>That leaves Lionel prep innate derived </v>
<v Speaker 1>from plants like ginger and lavender and</v>

735
00:40:12.431 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 1>another common flavoring and fragrance </v>
<v Speaker 1>additive.</v>

736
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.880
<v Speaker 1>It has been shown to help inhibit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proliferation of prostate cancer.</v>

737
00:40:18.881 --> 00:40:19.714
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrap up my ass at least in the form of </v>

738
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Nagani Kumquats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

739
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there you go.</v>

740
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:36.210
<v Speaker 1>So unless Lacroix is secretly including </v>
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of the beverage as Lionel,</v>

741
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.353
<v Speaker 1>then drinkers don't have anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear because it's not even anywhere </v>

742
00:40:42.581 --> 00:40:43.414
<v Speaker 1>close to being harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all naturally occurring </v>

743
00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.370
<v Speaker 1>flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

744
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:52.780
<v Speaker 1>these are all flavors that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies use and many of their products</v>

745
00:40:52.781 --> 00:40:53.614
<v Speaker 1>to flavor their beverages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes it act like Lacroix is </v>

746
00:40:57.821 --> 00:41:00.500
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a pouring coke,</v>

747
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.353
<v Speaker 1>gross insecticide for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm going to save fifty cents and </v>

748
00:41:05.111 --> 00:41:07.570
<v Speaker 1>pour some pointed at as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

749
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.720
<v Speaker 1>This is a widely used flavoring agent </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems by all accounts to be natural</v>

750
00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:20.770
<v Speaker 1>after all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on here?</v>

751
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:26.320
<v Speaker 1>What is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is going on?</v>

752
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Let me say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even water is toxic.</v>

753
00:41:28.481 --> 00:41:31.360
<v Speaker 1>When you consume too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually get water poisoning.</v>

754
00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

755
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 1>that's an incredible sued a water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming big water.</v>

756
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:40.423
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as somebody who's been on the receiving </v>

757
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.690
<v Speaker 1>end of bogus lawsuits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place,</v>

758
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 1>this lawsuit stinks to high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heck,</v>

759
00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:49.850
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Mike Theory,</v>

760
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:53.870
<v Speaker 1>big soda is behind it and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might sound like a joke,</v>

761
00:41:53.871 --> 00:41:57.710
<v Speaker 1>but think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The company Lacroix dominates,</v>

762
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:01.550
<v Speaker 1>dominates the market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to any grocery store,</v>

763
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.460
<v Speaker 1>any convenience store gets what's on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelf and guess what?</v>

764
00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:09.360
<v Speaker 1>People want Lacroix every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isla,</v>

765
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.000
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not get into that.</v>

766
00:42:11.001 --> 00:42:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole nother heated debate.</v>

767
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got a great marketing.</v>

768
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how,</v>

769
00:42:18.201 --> 00:42:19.034
<v Speaker 1>but they dominant like I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've slammed Lacroix previously on the </v>

770
00:42:21.741 --> 00:42:24.560
<v Speaker 1>podcast was like these motherfuckers act</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they invented soda water,</v>

771
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.373
<v Speaker 1>but here I am drinking it every episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on now at the same time </v>

772
00:42:34.101 --> 00:42:38.840
<v Speaker 1>as Lacroix is killing it and I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about $827,000,000</v>

773
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:39.674
<v Speaker 1>in sales last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what's simultaneously declining </v>

774
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.073
<v Speaker 1>hugely and sales soda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugary drinks as people realize that </v>

775
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:55.420
<v Speaker 1>consuming 50 grams of sugar is poison </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not lie on the oil or whatever.</v>

776
00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:57.773
<v Speaker 1>How about 50 grams of sugar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we sue Coca Cola for giving me </v>

777
00:43:01.251 --> 00:43:02.540
<v Speaker 1>diabetes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to.</v>

778
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.773
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we have lacroix dominating the </v>

779
00:43:08.751 --> 00:43:11.450
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Soda falling down.</v>

780
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:12.583
<v Speaker 1>What's happening now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The these big boys are losing market </v>

781
00:43:15.471 --> 00:43:20.300
<v Speaker 1>share to Lacroix and their soda water </v>
<v Speaker 1>brands are are getting smashed,</v>

782
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.570
<v Speaker 1>they're dominating the market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these big soda companies,</v>

783
00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.200
<v Speaker 1>they they need to get in because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>business is suffering.</v>

784
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.103
<v Speaker 1>So to me from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a total hit job of </v>

785
00:43:36.361 --> 00:43:39.420
<v Speaker 1>misinformation and the lawsuit is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get thrown out.</v>

786
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:40.853
<v Speaker 1>You can trust me on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the damage has already been done </v>

787
00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.710
<v Speaker 1>because I hear it on the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it on social media,</v>

788
00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I see it everywhere at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it stuck in your head.</v>

789
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:51.043
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a know fucked up is that nobody </v>

790
00:43:52.591 --> 00:43:54.330
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody goes,</v>

791
00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

792
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:59.280
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make that much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say they go,</v>

793
00:43:59.281 --> 00:44:01.470
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's poison in Lacroix.</v>

794
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.230
<v Speaker 1>We're all fucking going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We drink lacroix.</v>

795
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.410
<v Speaker 1>And they have successfully</v>

796
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.733
<v Speaker 1>tarnish the reputation of this pristine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautifully branded and naturally </v>

797
00:44:14.571 --> 00:44:18.230
<v Speaker 1>flavored sodie pop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

798
00:44:18.231 --> 00:44:20.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the beauty of this lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally bogus.</v>

799
00:44:20.631 --> 00:44:21.464
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get thrown out and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have tarnished the reputation and </v>

800
00:44:24.231 --> 00:44:25.064
<v Speaker 1>everybody's been taken the bait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile Mr Coca Cola has got his </v>

801
00:44:29.391 --> 00:44:32.610
<v Speaker 1>feet up and he's drinking lacroix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows it's the security of beverage.</v>

802
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.260
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile he's pedaling his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty coca cola bullshit.</v>

803
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:42.120
<v Speaker 1>So I say to all of our listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the [inaudible] boys out there,</v>

804
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.313
<v Speaker 1>crack open a lacroix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a sip and enjoy yourself and know </v>

805
00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:50.400
<v Speaker 1>that you are enjoying an all natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar free beverage.</v>

806
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:54.350
<v Speaker 1>And you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a lacroix boy.</v>

807

<v Speaker 1>So that's it.</v>

813
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:14.803
<v Speaker 1>Nice to have bunked two big topics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty minutes is this 60 minutes </v>

814
00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:21.903
<v Speaker 1>colgate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was working on my Alex Jones </v>

815
00:45:23.661 --> 00:45:24.900
<v Speaker 1>impression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was pretty good.</v>

816
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I did it during one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

817
00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.350
<v Speaker 1>copywriters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we cut it,</v>

818
00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.920
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of want to do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye.</v>

819
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:32.843
<v Speaker 1>Kanye gave trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make America great hat during his White </v>

820
00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:37.140
<v Speaker 1>House visit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really hurts my throat though.</v>

821
00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:39.253
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to figure how to do it where it </v>

822
00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:42.860
<v Speaker 1>doesn't irritate my throat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

823
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Kanye gave trump will make America great</v>
<v Speaker 1>hat during the White House visit.</v>

824
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Purple Hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys heard about all this?</v>

825
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Kanye west madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

826
00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.000
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about Kanye West.</v>

827
00:45:56.001 --> 00:45:56.834
<v Speaker 1>No good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Kanye met trump and we're going to </v>

828
00:46:01.731 --> 00:46:04.190
<v Speaker 1>talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do in our intern,</v>

829
00:46:04.191 --> 00:46:06.350
<v Speaker 1>who's a super fan of Kanye West says you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will know,</v>

830
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:11.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had some suggestions for Kanye West last</v>

831
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.073
<v Speaker 1>week and our previous episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had suggested that he make the hat </v>

832
00:46:18.321 --> 00:46:21.740
<v Speaker 1>purple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would symbolize the joining of the</v>

833
00:46:21.741 --> 00:46:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Democrats and the Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're red and the blue.</v>

834
00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red And blue makes purple cares.</v>

835
00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Here's Kanye and a purple hat.</v>

836
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Not Evidence of much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

837
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 1>we had thought that it said make America</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

838
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:38.070
<v Speaker 1>You can't really read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you?</v>

839
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.150
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say that though,</v>

840
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.640
<v Speaker 1>but interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>

841
00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:44.953
<v Speaker 1>Showing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inappropriate hat says exposed world </v>

842
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:52.930
<v Speaker 1>says Ian because he knows those world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he did,</v>

843
00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:53.853
<v Speaker 1>and then his other suggestion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggestion was don't wear a hat that </v>

844
00:46:56.811 --> 00:47:01.811
<v Speaker 1>says make America great again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hat that says make America great.</v>

845
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens later on that day,</v>

846
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:10.030
<v Speaker 1>my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

847
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I can't open it some behind that </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

848
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.900
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

849
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll make America great.</v>

850
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:20.330
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling it now.</v>

851
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.433
<v Speaker 1>People have suspected that Kanye lurks </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reddit of Kanye on Reddit and the </v>

852
00:47:26.601 --> 00:47:27.434
<v Speaker 1>clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highlight of and talking about it </v>

853
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:31.630
<v Speaker 1>was that subreddit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a chance,</v>

854
00:47:31.631 --> 00:47:32.464
<v Speaker 1>I swear to you now that Kanye West saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian suggestion and if he comes out with </v>

855
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:38.950
<v Speaker 1>a purple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make America great hat,</v>

856
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.640
<v Speaker 1>which is a great idea and I hope he does</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

857
00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is going to be amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I saw you.</v>

861
00:47:47.771 --> 00:47:49.830
<v Speaker 1>You seem pretty excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

863
00:47:54.101 --> 00:47:57.280
<v Speaker 1>presentation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell myself that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you did.</v>

865
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's a chance though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you think.</v>

866
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean like not going to fully commit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not purple.</v>

867
00:48:05.711 --> 00:48:07.100
<v Speaker 1>If it was purple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go he,</v>

868
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.640

<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

869
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:10.503
<v Speaker 1>based on a percentage out of 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the chances do you think you </v>

870
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:15.940

<v Speaker 1>the clip got a lot of views.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

872
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:24.300
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting timing and this looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a shitty one.</v>

873
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Not like the design one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pooped it out real fast.</v>

874
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:28.243

897
00:49:33.731 --> 00:49:35.600

<v Speaker 1>That was a freak out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>lot of blow back as you can expect,</v>

925
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:56.110
<v Speaker 1>but I'm here to focus on the funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whimsical,</v>

926
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:57.223
<v Speaker 1>the comedic.</v>

927
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.983
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 5>here's</v>

929
00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:02.293
<v Speaker 1>one great moment.</v>

930
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:03.973
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

931
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:09.910
<v Speaker 1>you can see Kanye password on his phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>came in.</v>

932
00:51:11.871 --> 00:51:12.411
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian,</v>

933
00:51:12.411 --> 00:51:13.244
<v Speaker 1>what's funniest password?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like just zeros as I come in </v>

934
00:51:15.771 --> 00:51:19.850
<v Speaker 1>and he's like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're fucking crazy to six 67.</v>

935
00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:20.521
<v Speaker 1>Six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

936
00:51:20.521 --> 00:51:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said 5:10,</v>

937
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:26.890
<v Speaker 1>but I guess he's revised his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he went back into and this whole</v>

938
00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:30.704
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

939
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:39.220
<v Speaker 1>ellen on one of his legendary I airplane</v>
<v Speaker 1>the airplane.</v>

940
00:51:39.501 --> 00:51:44.200
<v Speaker 1>We have a picture that but trump card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting cognition.</v>

941
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:45.043
<v Speaker 1>Just going off for like 20 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominating the conversation and I find </v>

942
00:51:48.801 --> 00:51:50.430
<v Speaker 1>it just so interesting that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

943
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.870
<v Speaker 1>how do I get that Angle Bac this angle </v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

944
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:59.020
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really look at trump when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking and trumps faith.</v>

945
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.863
<v Speaker 1>Is he just sitting there kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>embracing this angle is all is in the </v>

946
00:52:04.911 --> 00:52:07.430
<v Speaker 1>one I wanted for Christ sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

947
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:12.431
<v Speaker 1>We got up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye is a smart as tesla and Freud.</v>

948
00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:16.400
<v Speaker 1>See if ben can decode this.</v>

949
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.560
<v Speaker 5>I was conducted with a neuropsychologist</v>
<v Speaker 5>that works,</v>

950
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.113
<v Speaker 4>Matt,</v>

951
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.080
<v Speaker 5>but the athletes in the NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the NFL,</v>

952
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:31.120
<v Speaker 5>and he looked at my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go ahead,</v>

953
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.790
<v Speaker 5>drop some bombs for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ninety eight percent top out you test.</v>

954
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:37.550
<v Speaker 5>I had a 75 percentile of all human </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings,</v>

955
00:52:37.551 --> 00:52:40.390
<v Speaker 5>but it was counting eight numbers </v>
<v Speaker 5>backwards afterwards.</v>

956
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:41.810
<v Speaker 5>Repeat something going to work on that </v>
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

957
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:45.340
<v Speaker 5>The other one's 98 percent tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freud,</v>

958
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:47.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

959
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's trying to say he's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>

960
00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:55.973
<v Speaker 1>Am I correct in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's definitely coming across that </v>

961
00:52:57.991 --> 00:53:02.991
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're not commenting really.</v>

962
00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I think he's pursuing his words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

963
00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:09.650
<v Speaker 1>he's got the whole forum listening on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

964
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Things got so complicated for men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

965
00:53:14.221 --> 00:53:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't just take tuck his </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion anymore.</v>

966
00:53:19.081 --> 00:53:19.914
<v Speaker 1>He's a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a thought leader on it by his PR </v>

967
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:24.420
<v Speaker 1>and influencer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you need to pr now.</v>

968
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Can't have the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a reputation now.</v>

969
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.360
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have some bullshit username </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's faced.</v>

970
00:53:33.361 --> 00:53:35.220
<v Speaker 1>They know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a reputation.</v>

971
00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:39.380
<v Speaker 1>If he says the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this called Bob's coming from.</v>

972
00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This goes beyond username.</v>

973
00:53:40.921 --> 00:53:43.100
<v Speaker 1>This is real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

974
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Ian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you at least confirm he's,</v>

975
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:46.890
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to say that he is </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>

976
00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.390
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the general idea.</v>

977
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:51.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's once again,</v>

978
00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:54.390
<v Speaker 6>like the powerpoint where I showed all </v>
<v Speaker 6>the people you can compare themselves,</v>

979
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.680
<v Speaker 6>surprises,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Freud and a tesla.</v>

980
00:53:57.681 --> 00:53:58.730
<v Speaker 6>Wasn't the in there.</v>

981
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.540
<v Speaker 1>And who was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

982
00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.950
<v Speaker 1>the Disney character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

983
00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:06.230
<v Speaker 1>that's vanilla pea von sweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweets.</v>

984
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:09.780
<v Speaker 1>He should have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like sweet.</v>

985
00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Then as counting eight numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

986
00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:15.613
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were working on not doing the </v>

987
00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:24.300
<v Speaker 1>math anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other one's 98 percent tests.</v>

988
00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Look Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

989
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:30.650
<v Speaker 1>so he knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say confidence,</v>

990
00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.300
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

991
00:54:33.301 --> 00:54:35.670
<v Speaker 1>so that was the number one rock star on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

992
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:40.790
<v Speaker 1>So that was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the one,</v>

993
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.013
<v Speaker 1>I guess the one that really pissed </v>
<v Speaker 1>people off was that he hugged trump at </v>

994
00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:51.801
<v Speaker 1>the end and we saw this doctor or this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't God.</v>

995
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:56.860
<v Speaker 1>He showed him a picture of what does </v>
<v Speaker 1>this even in hell.</v>

996
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And decode.</v>

997
00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:01.423
<v Speaker 6>It's not his design.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He took it from someone who did it as </v>

998
00:55:04.191 --> 00:55:08.390
<v Speaker 6>they're a university thesis a few years </v>
<v Speaker 6>ago,</v>

999
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.790
<v Speaker 6>and the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they asked him,</v>

1000
00:55:10.791 --> 00:55:12.020
<v Speaker 6>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do you think about this?</v>

1001
00:55:12.021 --> 00:55:12.854
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's got a cool that Connie saw </v>

1002
00:55:15.021 --> 00:55:17.120
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He didn't care that I have no idea how.</v>

1003
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:18.433
<v Speaker 1>So what are the chances we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get this air force one made in zero </v>

1004
00:55:21.321 --> 00:55:22.154
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1005
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.233
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hater form's gonna eat you alive for </v>

1006
00:55:26.721 --> 00:55:31.721

<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1018
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:08.843
<v Speaker 1>One was earth.</v>

1019

<v Speaker 1>the backlash has been so severe and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>read some things like Tei,</v>

1031
00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:48.250
<v Speaker 1>the famous rapper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he wrote.</v>

1032
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1039
00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:08.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say anything new.</v>

1040
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.823
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of the same antics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same content from the last six </v>

1041
00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:17.680
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I guess what happened is he showed a</v>

1042
00:57:17.681 --> 00:57:21.550
<v Speaker 1>lot of love and he hugged trump and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what set people off.</v>

1043
00:57:21.551 --> 00:57:24.650
<v Speaker 1>So extend them together and made it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>medium.</v>

1044
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:26.223
<v Speaker 1>So here it is.</v>

1045
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:30.430
<v Speaker 5>Well that I like and I guess they liked </v>
<v Speaker 5>me and we're going to have lunch.</v>

1046
00:57:30.431 --> 00:57:35.431
<v Speaker 5>We're gonna talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to take.</v>

1047
00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:39.310
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to put you in that spot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but standing in that spot.</v>

1048
00:57:39.311 --> 00:57:40.550
<v Speaker 5>I love this guy right here.</v>

1049
00:57:42.050 --> 00:57:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I did the secret service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not tackled his ass right now.</v>

1050
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.650
<v Speaker 5>I love this.</v>

1051
00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:55.093
<v Speaker 1>Got You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all a long call and there was </v>

1052
00:57:59.981 --> 00:58:03.670
<v Speaker 1>like a plot to a movie like that where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he tries to get close to the king.</v>

1053
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Some Kung Fu movie hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:08.710
<v Speaker 1>That movie's sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did it make sense of?</v>

1055
00:58:08.711 --> 00:58:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Konya was like the star of his own hero </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just stabbed trump.</v>

1056
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:15.220
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a wild twit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's like,</v>

1057
00:58:15.221 --> 00:58:16.054
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1058
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:20.743
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't.</v>

1059
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.823
<v Speaker 5>He didn't stab him</v>

1060
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:22.703
<v Speaker 1>and it gave him some love and in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably ruined the moment for you </v>

1061
00:58:25.151 --> 00:58:26.200
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me go back.</v>

1062
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.253
<v Speaker 1>I have a bad habit of pausing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking a lot and isla was trying to </v>

1063
00:58:31.631 --> 00:58:33.520
<v Speaker 1>correct me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was too late.</v>

1064
00:58:33.521 --> 00:58:34.354
<v Speaker 1>I already paused it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we go again for everyone to </v>

1065
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:37.120
<v Speaker 1>enjoy.</v>

1066
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:37.953
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that I like and I guess they </v>

1067
00:58:39.601 --> 00:58:42.240
<v Speaker 5>liked me and we're going to have lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to talk.</v>

1068
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:48.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to put you in that spot,</v>

1071
00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.200
<v Speaker 1>press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually really annoying.</v>

1072
00:58:57.201 --> 00:59:01.470
<v Speaker 1>You can't even hear what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cameras that can take pictures.</v>

1073
00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:02.304
<v Speaker 1>Do you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck does she know about </v>

<v Speaker 1>cameras?</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love this guy right here.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Let me get this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love this guy right here.</v>

1079
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:21.703
<v Speaker 5>Really</v>

1080
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:23.563
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to put you in that </v>

1081
00:59:23.901 --> 00:59:24.800
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1082
00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:26.523
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now let me read the response to the </v>

1083
00:59:29.291 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 1>flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reaction.</v>

1084
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:32.833
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1085
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:35.310
<v Speaker 1>this was cold blooded man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1086
00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:36.530
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what happened?</v>

1087
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:37.364
<v Speaker 1>He got</v>

1088
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:40.170
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah did.</v>

1089
00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got ghost started by a t I.</v>

1090
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:47.910
<v Speaker 1>and do you agree this was a ghost </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting?</v>

1091
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a good start.</v>

1092
00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Definitely goes right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me read this shit now.</v>

1093
00:59:52.051 --> 00:59:52.884
<v Speaker 1>I've been extremely patient and made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>a point to not jump to any premature </v>

1094
00:59:55.561 --> 00:59:56.394
<v Speaker 1>conclusions about you and his antics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partially due to the lessons learned </v>

1095
00:59:59.131 --> 01:00:01.830
<v Speaker 1>from the outcome of other similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation dealing with my brother Wayne,</v>

1096
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>which I mailed him mishandled a bit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hindsight,</v>

1097
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:09.500
<v Speaker 1>but now this shit is next level </v>
<v Speaker 1>futuristic sambo hopping Bob Steven off.</v>

1098
01:00:11.491 --> 01:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Django ass shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean in</v>

1099
01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:17.360
<v Speaker 1>those are all references to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like the,</v>

1100
01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>the uncle Tom thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a sambo.</v>

1101
01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:21.391
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

1102
01:00:21.391 --> 01:00:22.224
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a book that had like very racist </v>

1103
01:00:25.201 --> 01:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

1104
01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he refers to Django,</v>

1105
01:00:28.471 --> 01:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>which obviously that was the term Tina </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

1106
01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.613
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1107
01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Literary references very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1108
01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>eyebrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1109
01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>from what I can gather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the most repulsive,</v>

1110
01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:39.744
<v Speaker 1>disgraceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing act of desperation and </v>

1111
01:00:41.611 --> 01:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>auction off of one solid again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power I've ever seen.</v>

1112
01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:46.763
<v Speaker 1>Now I recall you asking me to come with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to have this meeting and I declined </v>

1113
01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bro,</v>

1114
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.033
<v Speaker 1>if ain't time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've been in there with you and </v>

1115
01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>you behave that spinelessly in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence.</v>

1116
01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I feel I'd be compelled to slap the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of you,</v>

1117
01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the people you asked,</v>

1118
01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:03.390
<v Speaker 1>kissing and boot licking on a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

1119
01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>and I refused to associate myself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something so vile week and inconsiderate</v>

1120
01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>to the effect this has on the greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>good of all of our people.</v>

1121
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm a true believer in it ain't what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

1122
01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>it's how you do it and this shit is </v>
<v Speaker 1>regurgitating at one time.</v>

1123
01:01:20.161 --> 01:01:20.994
<v Speaker 1>It was a pleasure to work alongside you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm ashamed to have been associated </v>

1124
01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To all the people who follow.</v>

1125
01:01:27.481 --> 01:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use the Yay.</v>

1126
01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

1127
01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1128
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Kanye was not part of a former.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything of people.</v>

1129
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so other people will follow.</v>

1130
01:01:40.771 --> 01:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Musically,</v>

1131
01:01:41.701 --> 01:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>socially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even personally who are confused,</v>

1132
01:01:44.281 --> 01:01:45.950
<v Speaker 1>heartbroken and fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat.</v>

1133
01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Let me make this clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shit ain't cool.</v>

1134
01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>This is all in caps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a movie made.</v>

1135
01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1136
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made for Yay.</v>

1137
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>This is a play to put him in position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd liked to see himself in.</v>

1138
01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>We are not on his mind as he makes these</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments in decisions.</v>

1139
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Don't follow this puppet where we're off</v>
<v Speaker 1>caps now because as long as I've lived,</v>

1140
01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.324
<v Speaker 1>I've learned that it benefits a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing at all to gain the world if to </v>

1141
01:02:12.511 --> 01:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must lose his soul.</v>

1142
01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>We just saw Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>West soul on auction.</v>

1143
01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:18.923
<v Speaker 1>If you listen closely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can hear the tears of our ancestors hit </v>

1144
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I can say is I've reached my limit.</v>

1145
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>This is my stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm officially done.</v>

1146
01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Middle Finger trump and his little cooky</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

1147
01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cold blooded shit.</v>

1148
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:38.693
<v Speaker 1>How did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you,</v>

1149
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>how did that make you feel in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1150
01:02:41.971 --> 01:02:42.804
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't fully weigh in on what that </v>

1151
01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>imagery feels like or to see that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1152
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1153
01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>African American in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1154
01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:55.430
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1155
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I completely understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see why he would have that.</v>

1156
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:01.410
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect his opinion.</v>

1157
01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:02.244
<v Speaker 1>They're very political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One t I did from what I understand was </v>

1158
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.990
<v Speaker 1>like his most ardent defender up to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1159
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:14.210
<v Speaker 1>is that true in opinion is working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigning now.</v>

1160
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:16.543
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough situation for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine that's got it as if </v>

1161
01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling you for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1162
01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.980
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I read it and it's hard to disagree</v>

1163
01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.820
<v Speaker 1>when this stuff that saying so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1164
01:03:29.821 --> 01:03:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Like we said last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can see what kind of was trying</v>

1165
01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:37.890
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in it's not a pure art movement.</v>

1166
01:03:37.891 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It's bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political and then it should be.</v>

1167
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so polarizing.</v>

1168
01:03:43.171 --> 01:03:44.004
<v Speaker 1>It's like on one hand I see where he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from and on the other hand I see </v>

1169
01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:49.374
<v Speaker 1>the black community as seeing Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump as a symbol of oppression of </v>

1170
01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:56.280
<v Speaker 1>establishment or whatever.</v>

1171
01:03:59.130 --> 01:03:59.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1172
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.520
<v Speaker 1>but I also see like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1173
01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.413
<v Speaker 1>I see it from both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really think he's going to try </v>

1174
01:04:06.421 --> 01:04:08.900
<v Speaker 1>and run for president to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1175
01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Fucking cringey Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

1176
01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not support.</v>

1177
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>And do you vote for Kanye would never </v>
<v Speaker 1>vote for it because I liked it.</v>

1178
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that kind of run everything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is.</v>

1179
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>So if he's read love is president or is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it just as he.</v>

1180
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Is he just trying to get political?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

1181
01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Is he trying to be genuine and spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>love and like bridge the divide or.</v>

1182
01:04:31.521 --> 01:04:32.354
<v Speaker 1>So you just want to run for president </v>
<v Speaker 1>positioning himself because that's what </v>

1183
01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Tai was saying and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1184
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.470
<v Speaker 1>And the conversation was very like about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye,</v>

1185
01:04:40.471 --> 01:04:43.680
<v Speaker 1>like it was talking about yeezy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adidas and how now.</v>

1186
01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.270
<v Speaker 1>So strange lands are a billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1187
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.290
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1188
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:51.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the conversation with Kanye?</v>

1189
01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:52.403
<v Speaker 1>Watching his rent strikes me very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>as somebody who is having a manic </v>

1190
01:04:58.681 --> 01:04:59.514
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been diagnosed as bipolar and when </v>

1191
01:05:02.311 --> 01:05:03.144
<v Speaker 1>I see him talking there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he strikes me as someone that's not </v>

1192
01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:08.820
<v Speaker 1>fully grounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1193
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I take that into consideration </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1194
01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mike,</v>

1195
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:15.023
<v Speaker 1>he's feeling strong more than usual </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions because he's in this manic </v>

1196
01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's like,</v>

1197
01:05:20.831 --> 01:05:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I love trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love what he represents as someone who</v>

1198
01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>did something that was impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love what the idea of what he's trying</v>

1199
01:05:28.661 --> 01:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>to do of like bringing jobs back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>America and America first.</v>

1200
01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye sees that as he just sees the best</v>

1201
01:05:35.201 --> 01:05:36.034
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sees the positive message and he </v>

1202
01:05:37.151 --> 01:05:39.610
<v Speaker 1>doesn't and there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticize that movement,</v>

1203
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.593
<v Speaker 1>but he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's full with strong emotions in love </v>

1204
01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:46.030
<v Speaker 1>and this manic state and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>

1205
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>he's not being smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's being emotional and so it's like A.</v>

1206
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Y'all really says that it was it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snl speech.</v>

1207
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>He straight up says like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to start thinking with our minds</v>

1208
01:05:57.741 --> 01:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>and start thinking with our hearts.</v>

1209
01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.770
<v Speaker 1>So I think he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not an A.</v>

1210
01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.053
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's grounded right home </v>
<v Speaker 1>and apparently or well we are noticing </v>

1211
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:12.503
<v Speaker 1>earlier he talks about how he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>misdiagnosed as bipolar and he was just </v>

1212
01:06:15.451 --> 01:06:16.284
<v Speaker 1>sleep deprived and so he's off his </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine and I'm watching this and be </v>

1213
01:06:18.691 --> 01:06:19.021
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1214
01:06:19.021 --> 01:06:22.380
<v Speaker 1>you must be really sleep deprived right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now if that's the case.</v>

1215
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:26.550
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is just wild and weird.</v>

1216
01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Is he going to run as a republican </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's kind of what he's angling</v>

1217
01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:33.320
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Independent.</v>

1218
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:37.230
<v Speaker 1>He might just try and do his own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a circus.</v>

1219
01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:41.740
<v Speaker 1>That would be a real circus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he wants vp trump.</v>

1277
01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:07.150
<v Speaker 1>really compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am pro choice by the way,</v>

1278
01:10:07.151 --> 01:10:09.760
<v Speaker 1>for I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm strongly in favor of pro choice.</v>

1279
01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to say that for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>record.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you think that makes me a cook or</v>

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:16.294
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine because we can have a </v>

1282
01:10:17.231 --> 01:10:19.780
<v Speaker 1>difference in opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect that you are pro life.</v>

1283
01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:22.450
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking haters.</v>

1284
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.260
<v Speaker 1>You can have an opinion and I can have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different opinion.</v>

1285
01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to come to my dressing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill me because I'm pro choice.</v>

1286
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Suck my tiny Jewish Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this guy's a fucking idiot.</v>

1287
01:10:35.591 --> 01:10:36.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's fun to watch.</v>

1288
01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:40.973
<v Speaker 7>It's a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Get someone who was raped and she gave </v>

1289
01:10:42.841 --> 01:10:44.820
<v Speaker 7>birth and she decided to kill her</v>

1290
01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:45.813
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1291
01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1292
01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I did the perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to say like people who are</v>

1293
01:10:53.531 --> 01:10:54.364
<v Speaker 1>pro life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand their point because it </v>

1294
01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:00.460
<v Speaker 1>comes from a religious place and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're murdering a baby.</v>

1295
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I personally disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're murdering a baby,</v>

1296
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:04.743
<v Speaker 1>but if you did think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can understand how you get and </v>

1297
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:13.090
<v Speaker 1>why would you be so passionate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like it's just slick.</v>

1298
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Unsolvable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1299
01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.850
<v Speaker 1>it's killing babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killing babies.</v>

1300
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:21.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of two more opposites.</v>

1301
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Killing a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worse thing ever.</v>

1302
01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Not killing a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1303
01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:31.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's killing baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy certainly doesn't.</v>

1304
01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:35.870
<v Speaker 1>You got to go back a little because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think this guy should have been aborted.</v>

1305
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:36.803
<v Speaker 1>Oof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oof</v>

1306
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.900
<v Speaker 5>child.</v>

1307
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I met the kick your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1308
01:11:50.191 --> 01:11:53.850
<v Speaker 1>well who does that imagine kicking </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's phone?</v>

1309
01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:58.940
<v Speaker 1>It's still assault defendant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really apologize either.</v>

1310
01:11:59.311 --> 01:12:01.500
<v Speaker 1>He's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>

1311
01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I kicked you in the face or phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that tongue out.</v>

1312
01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:11.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like an animated movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can probably run with his arms back.</v>

1313
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.320
<v Speaker 5>I didn't kill her three year old child.</v>

1314
01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.930
<v Speaker 1>He rounds up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

1315
01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Take your swaying hip into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

1316
01:12:23.150 --> 01:12:24.950
<v Speaker 1>That's basically a warning shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1317
01:12:24.951 --> 01:12:29.951
<v Speaker 1>you heard in world war two and World War</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two and Israel does it over like Gaza.</v>

1318
01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.030
<v Speaker 1>They'll drop leaflets and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1319
01:12:32.031 --> 01:12:33.710
<v Speaker 1>we're about to bomb this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get better.</v>

1320
01:12:33.711 --> 01:12:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Get Out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's doing.</v>

1321
01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Dropping leaflets on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1322
01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.473
<v Speaker 1>it's about to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you say that you clear the area </v>

1323
01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.240
<v Speaker 1>because a bomb is about to drop.</v>

1324
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.863
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

1325
01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:56.080
<v Speaker 5>That's a crazy kick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I doubt that guy will,</v>

1326
01:12:56.371 --> 01:13:00.490
<v Speaker 5>as much power to be frank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we slow motion?</v>

1327
01:13:00.491 --> 01:13:01.324
<v Speaker 5>Not here.</v>

1328
01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go to point two five on this.</v>

1329
01:13:04.150 --> 01:13:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1330
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:09.520
<v Speaker 1>speed point two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

1331
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1332
01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.233
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

1333
01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.320
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sounds cool.</v>

1334
01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:20.163
<v Speaker 5>Let's make it about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love how the conversation is over and </v>

1335
01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.810
<v Speaker 5>very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1336
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.300
<v Speaker 5>he probably doesn't have a lot of muscle</v>
<v Speaker 5>mass,</v>

1337
01:13:33.301 --> 01:13:35.580
<v Speaker 5>but he runs a well formed kick right </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1338
01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.420
<v Speaker 5>Sounds a towel.</v>

1339
01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.740
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone enjoyed that one.</v>

1340
01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:47.770
<v Speaker 1>That was a favorite of the week.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jake Paul.</v>

1342
01:13:50.231 --> 01:13:53.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that much to say about any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his new series except for this.</v>

1343
01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.180
<v Speaker 1>This was my favorite detail that came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the new episode.</v>

1344
01:13:58.210 --> 01:14:00.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a small little detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought it was great.</v>

<v Speaker 5>drives around and like he sleeps in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1352
01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:28.563

1356
01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:44.020
<v Speaker 1>underage girls on camera should not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping in a school bus outside a house</v>

1357

<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1368
01:15:14.941 --> 01:15:16.410
<v Speaker 1>That's my uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my takeaway.</v>

1369
01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.233
<v Speaker 1>Banksy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shreds is art and whatever some </v>

1370
01:15:20.611 --> 01:15:22.050
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I talk about this?</v>

1371
01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:25.330
<v Speaker 1>See Shreds his art.</v>

1372
01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.920
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cool except it was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>also lane if I'm being honest because.</v>

1373
01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Well here let's watch video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So banksy sold a piece of art or.</v>

1374
01:15:36.821 --> 01:15:37.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't sell.</v>

1375
01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:41.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how came to be in the front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his art.</v>

1376
01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:43.720
<v Speaker 1>So he sold it originally and then it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

1377
01:15:43.721 --> 01:15:44.554
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1378
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in being auctioned.</v>

1379
01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I think the story goes that he built the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shredder into it.</v>

1380
01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm like 10 years ago with the intention</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>

1381
01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:58.180
<v Speaker 1>if it ever went on auction he would do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1382
01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.193
<v Speaker 1>So this is like a long con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm wondering is if he is so </v>

1383
01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:06.010
<v Speaker 1>anti capitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he originally sold the art to somebody.</v>

1384
01:16:06.011 --> 01:16:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how did the auction house get it?</v>

1385
01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:11.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy is rich.</v>

1386
01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Very rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1387
01:16:13.811 --> 01:16:15.070
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really understand.</v>

1388
01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not really a.</v>

1389
01:16:16.961 --> 01:16:18.670
<v Speaker 1>is it a statement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

1390
01:16:18.671 --> 01:16:21.700
<v Speaker 1>What was the statement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to gag.</v>

1391
01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1392
01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like an actual quilt prank.</v>

1393
01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was like an anticapitalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't sell his work kind of thing.</v>

1394
01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Someone explicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't sell his work,</v>

1395
01:16:35.411 --> 01:16:36.244
<v Speaker 1>like I remember hearing a story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how someone had a bunch of his work on </v>

1396
01:16:38.741 --> 01:16:39.574
<v Speaker 1>display and they were charging him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get in and he was super unhappy about </v>

1397
01:16:41.921 --> 01:16:42.754
<v Speaker 1>that because you can buy prints over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>art and I'm sure Monday won't go so </v>

1398
01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:48.873
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know much about him so nobody </v>

1399
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:51.993
<v Speaker 1>knows.</v>

1400
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:53.583
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1401
01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:57.040
<v Speaker 1>That's some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

1402
01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Just I just had to blast you with those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1403
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:05.223
<v Speaker 1>so here we go.</v>

1404
01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:15.170
<v Speaker 8>In a thread into the brain</v>

1405
01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:24.020
<v Speaker 5>and there you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Years later sold for one point $4,</v>

1406
01:17:24.521 --> 01:17:29.521
<v Speaker 5>million dollar they're adopting and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the minute it closes somebody with a</v>

1407
01:17:36.571 --> 01:17:37.404
<v Speaker 5>real mode activated it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who was there not that a big ass smile </v>

1408
01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:45.930
<v Speaker 5>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a shame.</v>

1409
01:17:45.931 --> 01:17:50.931
<v Speaker 5>It didn't complete it because they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to preserve it.</v>

1410
01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.960
<v Speaker 5>So that's why I think like it's done</v>

1411
01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:56.853
<v Speaker 1>so beautifully to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the paper didn't get crumbled or </v>

1412
01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:00.310
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like.</v>

1413
01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:03.520
<v Speaker 1>So is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again that's my question is about his</v>

1414
01:18:03.521 --> 01:18:07.810
<v Speaker 1>intention because I don't think his </v>
<v Speaker 1>intention was to destroy it</v>

1415
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:11.770
<v Speaker 1>because it only shreds half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it stopped.</v>

1416
01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a statement because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1417
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 1>someone just paid one point 4 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>for this up since he did it.</v>

1418
01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.433
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only is it a valuable piece of </v>

1419
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:25.580
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's part of his theory of art.</v>

1420
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:28.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's pretty cool that he pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>that off.</v>

1421
01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:30.043
<v Speaker 1>I'm just confused about the message </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it increased the value and it </v>

1422
01:18:32.931 --> 01:18:35.300
<v Speaker 1>seemed like he intentionally didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy the whole painting.</v>

1423
01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't care that much and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it matters that much.</v>

1424
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it was still a cool moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were freaking out,</v>

1425
01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:46.070
<v Speaker 1>like all of a sudden this paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>shredding itself.</v>

1426
01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1427
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:50.540
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an intentional that it fucked up.</v>

1428
01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Like if he really built this thing 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

1429
01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:53.763
<v Speaker 1>like malfunction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sharing you that this would raise </v>

1430
01:18:56.271 --> 01:18:59.450
<v Speaker 1>the volume just because that's how art </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes that moment.</v>

1431
01:18:59.451 --> 01:19:01.460
<v Speaker 1>That never happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

1432
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant that long.</v>

1433
01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:09.860
<v Speaker 1>You waited patiently for 10 years for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this beautiful model where some idiot,</v>

1434
01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to call them an idiot.</v>

1435
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurt Vonnegut,</v>

1436
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I love this saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not talking,</v>

1437
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:19.700
<v Speaker 1>you can spend 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

1438
01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:22.080
<v Speaker 1>$30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a piece of art and culture,</v>

1439
01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.230
<v Speaker 1>but when you start spending like </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions,</v>

1440
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>you're paying for prestige,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1441
01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurt vonnegut has this great quote.</v>

1442
01:19:32.121 --> 01:19:37.121
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>art is a conspiracy between the rich and</v>

1443
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:38.540
<v Speaker 1>and like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1444
01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:41.330
<v Speaker 1>end the art world to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1445
01:19:41.331 --> 01:19:43.770
<v Speaker 1>that's so bad to make people feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

1446
01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:44.653
<v Speaker 1>Or is it a conspiracy between rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and artist to make poor people </v>

1447
01:19:46.701 --> 01:19:47.534
<v Speaker 1>feel stupid because you see a painting </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold for 20 million bucks and you're </v>

1448
01:19:51.051 --> 01:19:52.760
<v Speaker 1>making $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year and you're like,</v>

1449
01:19:52.761 --> 01:19:53.594
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the funny stories that some other </v>

1450
01:19:56.741 --> 01:20:01.741
<v Speaker 1>guy who owns a print shredded it carries</v>
<v Speaker 1>more weight,</v>

1451
01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:06.840
<v Speaker 1>is do we have a picture of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1452
01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:09.350
<v Speaker 1>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have A.</v>

1453
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:10.673
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that a valuable print before of </v>

1454
01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:17.640
<v Speaker 1>$40,000?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why the fuck?</v>

1455
01:20:17.850 --> 01:20:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Like what did he take a scissor to it?</v>

1456
01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:22.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

1457
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>

1458
01:20:23.781 --> 01:20:24.614
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally think that that was </v>

1459
01:20:25.971 --> 01:20:27.590
<v Speaker 1>intentional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How it stopped right there.</v>

1460
01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:30.050
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of still beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is very beautiful.</v>

1461
01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.840
<v Speaker 1>So what it was is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1462
01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:34.510
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't destroying someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>purchased.</v>

1463
01:20:34.511 --> 01:20:38.420
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a little bit of a gift.</v>

1464
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Everyone freaked out.</v>

1465
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Definitely ended up as a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1466
01:20:44.691 --> 01:20:48.410
<v Speaker 1>the guy who bought it had the option to </v>
<v Speaker 1>back out and he was like,</v>

1467
01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:49.101
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1468
01:20:49.101 --> 01:20:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1469
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:53.540
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like by you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember Mark Mcgrath?</v>

1470
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:54.403
<v Speaker 1>What was that guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The baseball player that like broke the </v>

1471
01:20:56.941 --> 01:20:59.840
<v Speaker 1>home run record and mark mcgwire Mark </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcguire,</v>

1472
01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.390
<v Speaker 1>market country sugar sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1473
01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:04.021
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar,</v>

1474
01:21:04.021 --> 01:21:06.470
<v Speaker 1>a sugar ray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1475
01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:11.500
<v Speaker 1>he broke the home run record and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foul ball hit into the stadium.</v>

1476
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:13.253
<v Speaker 1>The guy who caught it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isla sold it for 3 million bucks and </v>

1477
01:21:16.621 --> 01:21:18.600
<v Speaker 1>then extends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was on steroids.</v>

1478
01:21:18.601 --> 01:21:20.490
<v Speaker 1>They kept breaking the record like every</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

1479
01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:24.210
<v Speaker 1>So it lost all of its value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is that foul ball.</v>

1480
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:28.950
<v Speaker 3>So a closed down one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1482
01:21:31.021 --> 01:21:33.300
<v Speaker 3>So here,</v>

<v Speaker 1>upon themselves to shred their own grill</v>
<v Speaker 1>with blueprint in order to increase its </v>

1487
01:21:43.361 --> 01:21:45.330
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have taken a piece of art,</v>

1488
01:21:45.331 --> 01:21:49.120
<v Speaker 1>earthly rough worth the 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds and in our opinion,</v>

1489
01:21:49.121 --> 01:21:51.260
<v Speaker 1>made its value one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1492
01:21:57.850 --> 01:21:58.683
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they even want to give </v>

1493
01:21:59.311 --> 01:22:00.510
<v Speaker 3>that guy any attention.</v>

1494

<v Speaker 1>Like that's not how it works.</v>

1497
01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:13.190
<v Speaker 3>The seller wanted them to list it as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>80,</v>

1498
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:15.530
<v Speaker 3>80,000</v>

1502
01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll bet I'll bet a dollar on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says worth a dollar.</v>

1503
01:22:29.401 --> 01:22:31.500
<v Speaker 1>I got a dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start the bidding.</v>

1504
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:35.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that piece has history to.</v>

1505
01:22:35.601 --> 01:22:38.150
<v Speaker 1>It was the idiot who cut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1506
01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

1507
01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.480
<v Speaker 1>we've spent a lot of money on art.</v>

1508
01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:46.063
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:49.080
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe like a couple thousand dollars,</v>

1510
01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:51.063
<v Speaker 1>which you're basically paying for </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's time and appreciation versus </v>

1511
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:56.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$20,000,000</v>

1512
01:22:56.761 --> 01:22:58.540
<v Speaker 1>for a print.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1513
01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.450
<v Speaker 1>as a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1514
01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate art that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I like and I'll,</v>

1515
01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll spend a thousand bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple thousand bucks,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean that things,</v>

1520
01:23:25.190 --> 01:23:26.023
<v Speaker 1>I guess worth 100,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like the size of this whole </v>

<v Speaker 1>Howard stern had this great bit where he</v>

1535
01:24:20.231 --> 01:24:23.080
<v Speaker 1>went on the street that the Boston </v>
<v Speaker 1>bomber,</v>

1536
01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.190
<v Speaker 1>he was this handsome young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Arab kid,</v>

1537
01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:28.083
<v Speaker 1>the Boston bomber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a lot of girls who are </v>

1538
01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:30.874
<v Speaker 1>like a talking about how cute he was and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they went on the street with a </v>

1539
01:24:35.741 --> 01:24:38.740
<v Speaker 1>picture of Howard and a picture of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston bomber and the like.</v>

1540
01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:39.574
<v Speaker 1>Which one would you rather date?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone was picking the Boston </v>

1541
01:24:42.101 --> 01:24:44.710
<v Speaker 1>bomber over at Howard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

1542
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:47.650
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather data terrorists than our.</v>

1543
01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the record.</v>

1544
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was he?</v>

1545
01:24:52.670 --> 01:24:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I think he was a Chechnyan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a Muslim.</v>

1546
01:24:56.621 --> 01:24:57.970
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't an Arab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1547
01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My bad.</v>

1548
01:24:59.110 --> 01:25:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I stand corrected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to stand at my pulpit.</v>

1549
01:25:02.381 --> 01:25:03.214
<v Speaker 1>I want to say I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apologize to all of my Arab brothers </v>

1550
01:25:05.861 --> 01:25:10.030
<v Speaker 1>out there who have been offended in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate mischaracterization.</v>

1551
01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Not all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all Arabs are terrorists,</v>

1552
01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:13.714
<v Speaker 1>and that was not what I meant to imply </v>
<v Speaker 1>by any means of any stretch of </v>

1553
01:25:16.331 --> 01:25:17.164
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a Muslim young man of Chechnyan </v>

1554
01:25:19.571 --> 01:25:20.890
<v Speaker 1>descent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I believe is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Greece has banned fat tourists from </v>

1568
01:26:11.391 --> 01:26:12.224
<v Speaker 1>riding on donkeys after campaigners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the animals were being left with </v>

1569
01:26:14.421 --> 01:26:17.000
<v Speaker 1>spinal injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a tiny little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never once had the urge to write a </v>

1572
01:26:25.131 --> 01:26:25.964
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really even like a donkey </v>

1580
01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.493
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a Nathan for you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people on horses and he had to put </v>

1581
01:26:51.601 --> 01:26:55.080
<v Speaker 1>like weather balloons on him and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>how do they define fat?</v>

1584
01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:03.000

<v Speaker 1>Let's see how they define it.</v>

1585
01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:04.440
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Rides and salary should not carry any </v>
<v Speaker 1>load is heavier than 100 kilograms.</v>

1588
01:27:12.570 --> 01:27:16.800
<v Speaker 1>What does that convert to see sound like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

1589
01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.713
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred and 20 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unless you're extremely tall and </v>

1590
01:27:23.581 --> 01:27:27.280
<v Speaker 1>built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're over 2100.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1601
01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.940
<v Speaker 1>They're just a little donkeys though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not horses.</v>

1602
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:11.550
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to save them going </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the stairs so he can do the stairs.</v>

1621

<v Speaker 1>stairs are my fucking tripping balls.</v>

1622
01:29:15.930 --> 01:29:20.880

<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm thinking of something else.</v>

1623

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1642
01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:28.130
<v Speaker 1>this one was so funny from Joey Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1643
01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Hey Ethan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isla,</v>

1644
01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:30.193
<v Speaker 1>I listened to you're at number 87 </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts where you mentioned how semen </v>

1645
01:30:32.241 --> 01:30:33.074
<v Speaker 1>can clog up the drain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was relevant to me because the </v>

1646
01:30:35.511 --> 01:30:38.030
<v Speaker 1>freshmen housing at my school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God I don't live there.</v>

1647
01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ken's Shaw State,</v>

1648
01:30:40.670 --> 01:30:43.490
<v Speaker 1>they had to remove and replace the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plumbing for one of the buildings,</v>

1649
01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:47.710
<v Speaker 1>the whole entire building due to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>buildup of semen tangling with air.</v>

1650
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:49.013
<v Speaker 1>There is a photo of the notice that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university housing put up to reminds </v>

1651
01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:53.570
<v Speaker 1>just not to jerk off in the shower.</v>

1652
01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:57.950
<v Speaker 1>When you said there is a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost.</v>

1653
01:30:58.190 --> 01:30:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1654
01:30:58.690 --> 01:31:00.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1655
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I have the same fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not jerking off in the shower,</v>

1656
01:31:04.041 --> 01:31:07.100
<v Speaker 1>where are you jerking off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a communal shower.</v>

1657
01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:10.910
<v Speaker 1>You've got to jerk off responsibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrice O'neil had the Chris joke.</v>

1658
01:31:10.911 --> 01:31:11.744
<v Speaker 1>Every says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I jerked off in the shower so many </v>

1659
01:31:12.891 --> 01:31:13.724
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised a little baby hasn't </v>

1660
01:31:14.691 --> 01:31:19.691
<v Speaker 1>crawled out your residence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have recently found several blockages</v>

1661
01:31:21.321 --> 01:31:24.860
<v Speaker 1>in plumbing system in university village</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweets mostly caused by human hair.</v>

1662
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Let me set my water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1663
01:31:28.581 --> 01:31:30.950
<v Speaker 1>over the last month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have found many of these blockages to</v>

1664
01:31:30.951 --> 01:31:34.820
<v Speaker 1>be caused by large quantities of what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have now determined to be semen.</v>

1665
01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:40.280
<v Speaker 1>This is intolerable because semen is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>soluble in water.</v>

1666
01:31:40.281 --> 01:31:44.120
<v Speaker 1>It gets caught and filters and our sis </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and particularly susceptible.</v>

1667
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:48.080
<v Speaker 1>This issue has cost the university </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of dollars to repair this far.</v>

1668
01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:49.413
<v Speaker 1>Thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing you collect a lot of tuition </v>

1669
01:31:50.541 --> 01:31:52.970
<v Speaker 1>since stopped complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's warm out my semen,</v>

1670
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:58.430
<v Speaker 1>though we know that though we know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you must take care of your business.</v>

1671
01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.350
<v Speaker 1>We have never faced a situation of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormity before.</v>

1672
01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.230
<v Speaker 1>It is because of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

1673
01:32:05.231 --> 01:32:07.870
<v Speaker 1>that we must ask you to refrain from </v>
<v Speaker 1>masturbating in the shower.</v>

1674
01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:09.693
<v Speaker 1>May we those who wished to masturbate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do so in the comfort of their own </v>

1675
01:32:12.431 --> 01:32:15.280
<v Speaker 1>bedroom and dispose of their discharge </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriately.</v>

1676
01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I bet you 90 percent of the dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to jack off in the shop.</v>

1677
01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.393
<v Speaker 1>I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet unlike [inaudible] no signature </v>

1678
01:32:25.301 --> 01:32:26.560
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy should frame it.</v>

1679
01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:27.813
<v Speaker 1>No signature,</v>

1680
01:32:29.650 --> 01:32:30.483
<v Speaker 4>Joey.</v>

1681
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:34.140
<v Speaker 1>That's the tough thing how you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantee that.</v>

1682
01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:35.813
<v Speaker 1>It's like you gotta stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm jerking off in the shower that God </v>

1683
01:32:38.881 --> 01:32:42.510
<v Speaker 1>intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why school is so expensive,</v>

1684
01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:45.720
<v Speaker 1>so the fucking demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

1685
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I had a communal shower and college boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was cold sexual boys and girls shared</v>

1686
01:32:53.011 --> 01:32:53.821
<v Speaker 1>the same bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1687
01:32:53.821 --> 01:32:58.821
<v Speaker 1>I know it was progressive Santa Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was all the.</v>

1688
01:32:59.161 --> 01:33:02.720
<v Speaker 1>So you would come out with a towel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1689
01:33:02.721 --> 01:33:03.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1690
01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:05.900
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't naked people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1691
01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like there's like four showers,</v>

1692
01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:13.710
<v Speaker 1>stalls next to each other with like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>curtain and private stall.</v>

1693
01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:15.600
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a cold wet,</v>

1694
01:33:16.890 --> 01:33:17.910
<v Speaker 1>but there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>

1695
01:33:18.090 --> 01:33:20.880
<v Speaker 1>There was semen on the floor sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

1696
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bathtub in there by the way.</v>

1697
01:33:24.511 --> 01:33:25.344
<v Speaker 1>Then nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1698
01:33:25.410 --> 01:33:30.210
<v Speaker 1>But God forbid you were in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't a coed there.</v>

1699
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Are you fucking kidding?</v>

1700
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:32.323
<v Speaker 1>Co?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything I know about the military is </v>

1701
01:33:34.981 --> 01:33:38.490
<v Speaker 1>from starship troopers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know it.</v>

1702
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:39.783
<v Speaker 1>It's the females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had our own like little area and the </v>

1703
01:33:46.291 --> 01:33:47.124
<v Speaker 1>mail having their own area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the Western Wall is separated and </v>

1704
01:33:49.471 --> 01:33:53.760
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking fully clothed that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>US military is and coed.</v>

1705
01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starship troopers are eight.</v>

1706
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:59.443
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget that scene and I saw </v>

1707
01:34:01.681 --> 01:34:06.681
<v Speaker 1>some titties that I didn't expect that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>still have a shower and I was like,</v>

1708
01:34:06.721 --> 01:34:09.120
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I ended up,</v>

1709
01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if somebody like looked at me,</v>

1710
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:13.343
<v Speaker 1>pop a boner and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they shower with her and they </v>

1711
01:34:16.811 --> 01:34:17.644
<v Speaker 1>don't all have fat boners right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when you're 13 and like you </v>

1712
01:34:27.561 --> 01:34:29.240
<v Speaker 1>tend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit a speed bump on the bus a little</v>

1713
01:34:29.241 --> 01:34:30.350
<v Speaker 1>too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pop a boner,</v>

1714
01:34:33.190 --> 01:34:35.770
<v Speaker 1>tuck it under the belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get really good at the uh,</v>

1715
01:34:35.771 --> 01:34:36.800
<v Speaker 1>the Bass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1716
01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:39.450
<v Speaker 1>the backpack masking method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1717
01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:40.533
<v Speaker 1>Was checking something in your backpack?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tucked it under the belt most of the </v>

1718
01:34:45.071 --> 01:34:45.904
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes because you have to kind </v>

1719
01:34:48.871 --> 01:34:50.620
<v Speaker 1>of maneuver for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

1720
01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:51.673
<v Speaker 1>a lot of tucking and grabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the backpack is definitely a god </v>

1721
01:34:54.970 --> 01:34:55.803
<v Speaker 1>send.</v>

1722
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:03.490
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the two options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything else.</v>

1723
01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:04.473
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything else in or Zach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there another way that you guys </v>

1724
01:35:06.131 --> 01:35:11.131
<v Speaker 1>concealed boners rarely ever get them at</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

1725
01:35:12.001 --> 01:35:16.590
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as I got home and was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting on the toilet when I was 13,</v>

1726
01:35:16.770 --> 01:35:19.310
<v Speaker 1>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1727
01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:20.473
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pop a bony on the toilet because </v>

1728
01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:26.310
<v Speaker 1>it's like your space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do your business jerk off.</v>

1729
01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm saying.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Always separate.</v>

1739
01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1740
01:36:00.041 --> 01:36:05.041
<v Speaker 1>like it was either one before the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you sit there still do flush the bulb</v>

1741
01:36:06.151 --> 01:36:07.780
<v Speaker 1>before he check off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you said over the shit.</v>

1742

<v Speaker 1>flush and then you've still stinks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1747
01:36:34.110 --> 01:36:36.460
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like to smell your own parts?</v>

1748
01:36:36.970 --> 01:36:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Not even a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not intrigued.</v>

1749
01:36:38.690 --> 01:36:40.120
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not intrigued.</v>

1750
01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Not intrigued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least interested.</v>

1751
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Interested in what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smell.</v>

1752
01:36:45.330 --> 01:36:47.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking liar.</v>

1753
01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:52.620
<v Speaker 1>That's like a biological fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people liked the smell,</v>

1754
01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.450
<v Speaker 1>their own fars like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they enjoy.</v>

1755
01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I think so you'd think Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you like the smell it?</v>

1756
01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:59.173
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

1757
01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:04.453
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you started by saying it's a fact and </v>

1758
01:37:05.661 --> 01:37:07.300
<v Speaker 1>then you finished with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1759
01:37:08.230 --> 01:37:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is another debate.</v>

1760
01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I think people like the smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will.</v>

1761
01:37:15.370 --> 01:37:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I will give you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of tolerate it for sure.</v>

1762
01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:21.810
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I her,</v>

1763
01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You smell it and enjoy it.</v>

1764
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:30.191
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

1765
01:37:30.191 --> 01:37:33.140
<v Speaker 1>you breathe deeply on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just doing a movie.</v>

1766
01:37:33.190 --> 01:37:35.240
<v Speaker 1>I am not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the small amount of parks.</v>

1767
01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.200
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1768
01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.073
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is another one of these things </v>

1769
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:42.400
<v Speaker 1>mean to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being genuine by the way.</v>

1770
01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would I admit to that?</v>

1771
01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:51.880
<v Speaker 1>But like why would I lie about liking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spelman being controversial?</v>

1772
01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not eva wants desperately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the believer.</v>

1773
01:37:55.231 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm hearing.</v>

1774
01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was another one somebody asked,</v>

1775
01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:01.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the spirit of all these </v>

1776
01:38:04.711 --> 01:38:09.711
<v Speaker 1>conversations id zed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zed zed slur asked,</v>

1777
01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I was always convinced everyone picks </v>
<v Speaker 1>their nose picking her nose,</v>

1778
01:38:14.191 --> 01:38:15.024
<v Speaker 1>ventilates it effectively and enables </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to breathe much easier for the more </v>

1779
01:38:17.971 --> 01:38:18.804
<v Speaker 1>scraping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nice dry chunk of snot out of your </v>

1780
01:38:20.011 --> 01:38:20.844
<v Speaker 1>nose is the best feeling ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it seems like a basic human </v>

1781
01:38:23.371 --> 01:38:26.160
<v Speaker 1>necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe those are just my own habits.</v>

1782
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Ever since you started these types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation on your podcast,</v>

1783
01:38:29.851 --> 01:38:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I started doubting my judgment on what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal and what is not more and more.</v>

1784
01:38:33.961 --> 01:38:35.100
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you pick your nose?</v>

1785
01:38:35.101 --> 01:38:37.800
<v Speaker 1>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which finger do use also?</v>

1786
01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure there are people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>even eat their burger.</v>

1787
01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure whether it is only kids or </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults to personally.</v>

1788
01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I always found it gross so I never did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

1789
01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:50.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1790
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:52.343
<v Speaker 1>we're discussing taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're breaking apart tonight on 60 </v>

1791
01:38:55.861 --> 01:38:56.694
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

1792
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone picks their nose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's certain levels to it.</v>

1793
01:39:03.091 --> 01:39:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm in the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I find it gross.</v>

1794
01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.820
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm in the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good place to pick my nose,</v>

1795
01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:12.150
<v Speaker 1>but generally I'll try to use a tissue </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something just because I don't.</v>

1796
01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's kind of gross </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally.</v>

1797
01:39:15.541 --> 01:39:16.374
<v Speaker 1>But I think everyone picks their nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you what's grocer that I've seen </v>

1798
01:39:21.031 --> 01:39:21.864
<v Speaker 1>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're just walking with </v>

1799
01:39:23.011 --> 01:39:26.260
<v Speaker 1>somebody on the street and just out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere without saying anything.</v>

1800
01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh my fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst is the worst.</v>

1801
01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.130
<v Speaker 1>You're just having a conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make conversation.</v>

1802
01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Should Sean Balog does that?</v>

1803
01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you calling?</v>

1804
01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't care.</v>

1805
01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.473
<v Speaker 1>And then they won't come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll go on the street with </v>

1806
01:39:53.251 --> 01:39:54.084
<v Speaker 1>shredder the other day and someone just </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking across the street from me and </v>

1807
01:39:57.201 --> 01:39:58.034
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that in sight of </v>

1808
01:40:02.031 --> 01:40:05.810
<v Speaker 1>another human being a lunatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that's normal.</v>

1809
01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:12.040
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1810
01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Shit's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So picking the nose,</v>

1811
01:40:20.601 --> 01:40:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1812
01:40:22.690 --> 01:40:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Eating boogers is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're under the age of eight,</v>

1813
01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.630
<v Speaker 1>you need to plug in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Weirdo over.</v>

1814
01:40:28.690 --> 01:40:29.740
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1815
01:40:29.741 --> 01:40:30.850
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say I don't want to.</v>

1816
01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I never did it as my personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>preference.</v>

1817
01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I seen some friends where I look over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like trying to like low key.</v>

1818
01:40:39.071 --> 01:40:43.960
<v Speaker 1>They're bugs when I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know people do that.</v>

1819
01:40:44.170 --> 01:40:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to shame booger eaters </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're.</v>

1820
01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:49.600
<v Speaker 1>We're getting out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're putting it all out there.</v>

1821
01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:50.493
<v Speaker 1>So I think I do think there's a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of adults eat their burgers </v>

1822
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.280
<v Speaker 1>and secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea to me is frankly repulsive.</v>

1823
01:40:58.780 --> 01:40:59.613
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Zachary fee and then </v>

1824
01:41:04.121 --> 01:41:06.010
<v Speaker 1>anything is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like it.</v>

1825
01:41:06.011 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like smelling your own far to me.</v>

1826
01:41:07.781 --> 01:41:08.614
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But eating a burger makes me want to </v>

1827
01:41:09.641 --> 01:41:11.100
<v Speaker 1>fucking die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He enter.</v>

1828
01:41:11.101 --> 01:41:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Zach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask for posterity.</v>

1829
01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Do any of you guys pick your nose or eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>your books?</v>

1830
01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I would rather lick dog poop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then wonder what about your own Burger?</v>

1831
01:41:18.730 --> 01:41:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1832
01:41:22.211 --> 01:41:23.044
<v Speaker 1>never year and it's his own books only </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets the skepticism came into dry too </v>

1833
01:41:30.881 --> 01:41:33.490
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1834
01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.520
<v Speaker 1>that was interesting conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just.</v>

1835
01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:43.750
<v Speaker 1>That's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know about dog becomes mares.</v>

1836
01:41:43.751 --> 01:41:46.630
<v Speaker 1>That's something interesting or no dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>became a mayor.</v>

1837
01:41:47.230 --> 01:41:48.011
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1838
01:41:48.011 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 1>That's just what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1839
01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:50.913
<v Speaker 1>there's this whole story about a dog is </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting reelected as mayor and what it </v>

1840
01:41:54.221 --> 01:41:56.770
<v Speaker 1>made me think about is what does this </v>
<v Speaker 1>say about the job,</v>

1841
01:41:56.771 --> 01:41:59.380
<v Speaker 1>mayor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped the bullying the video.</v>

1842
01:41:59.381 --> 01:42:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Say like you did good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that mean?</v>

1843
01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:04.600
<v Speaker 1>He's a good boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being the mayors of serious job.</v>

1844
01:42:04.601 --> 01:42:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Like you get paid like you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities.</v>

1845
01:42:06.581 --> 01:42:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what does this say about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>government job?</v>

1846
01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the mayor of La is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious job.</v>

1847
01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:16.031

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:42:16.031 --> 01:42:17.290
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in,</v>

1849
01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:20.200
<v Speaker 1>in smaller towns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mayor is like a ceremonial thing,</v>

1850
01:42:20.230 --> 01:42:23.470
<v Speaker 1>like the city council really run shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the mayor,</v>

1851
01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I know this completely from parks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rec.</v>

1852
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:30.270
<v Speaker 1>So take this all with everything I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>is based off your shows and the movies,</v>

1853
01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:34.180

1855

<v Speaker 1>dollar to vote for the mayor.</v>

1856
