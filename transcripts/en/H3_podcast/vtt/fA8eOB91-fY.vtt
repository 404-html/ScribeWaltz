54
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you give somebody food,</v>

55
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.120
<v Speaker 1>you feed them,</v>

<v Speaker 1>somebody water?</v>

60
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>When you give them a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Feed.</v>

61
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Could you say feed them water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You drink them.</v>

62
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>There's no word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is there no word for that?</v>

63
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Clench your watch.</v>

67
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.743
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean this like I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been really troubling me this </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

73
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't been able to get over the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole week that there's no word for</v>

74
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>the word to drink to give somebody water</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the English language we have,</v>

75
00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.253
<v Speaker 1>we're celebrated for having $100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand in the world going by far the </v>

76
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>most words of any language that ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>

77
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.173
<v Speaker 1>English language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no word for giving water and anybody in </v>

78
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>the chat got to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no chat.</v>

79
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>There's no chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

80
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that exists to drink,</v>

81
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.000
<v Speaker 1>so that's been really keeping me up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

82
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.893
<v Speaker 1>Frankly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in the comments you guys will </v>

83
00:04:26.631 --> 00:04:27.464
<v Speaker 1>figure it out,</v>

84
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.753
<v Speaker 1>but guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I googled it and for a baby you suckle </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:39.270
<v Speaker 1>My friend was thirsty so I suckled him </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my water.</v>

88
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that that sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

89
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:42.624
<v Speaker 1>hey buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you think is suckling the </v>

91
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens with somebody is thirsty</v>

92
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.810
<v Speaker 1>and you gave them something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no word,</v>

93
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>there's no freaking word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is there no word for that?</v>

94
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.223
<v Speaker 1>You does that mind bending like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've gone my whole life to until </v>

95
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:11.874
<v Speaker 1>this week without realizing that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's weird to this person is saying I </v>

96
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:17.730
<v Speaker 1>would go with hydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get real.</v>

97
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can I have some water?</v>

98
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here the hydrate,</v>

99
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.550
<v Speaker 1>hydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:24.870
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feed.</v>

101
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.640
<v Speaker 1>I fed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no freaking word</v>

102
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.390
<v Speaker 1>for some reason you would say water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The horse water.</v>

103
00:05:38.391 --> 00:05:39.091
<v Speaker 1>The horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

104
00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:40.040
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flour.</v>

105
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:43.730
<v Speaker 1>But it's not for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could water a horse proudly.</v>

106
00:05:43.731 --> 00:05:47.250
<v Speaker 1>You could say feeding and watering the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horses so you could water the.</v>

107
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little confusing to be honest.</v>

108
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Half of me expects that somebody is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say it.</v>

109
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:52.851
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

110
00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:54.290
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

111
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tinkle tinkle like,</v>

112
00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously no,</v>

113
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no freaking word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

114
00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking to this ongoing debate about</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wish.</v>

115
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>There was a chat right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

116
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 1>it'd be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we invent a word?</v>

117
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Like what works with fed feed and drank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drank them some water.</v>

118
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.480
<v Speaker 1>That sounds weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She made a little [inaudible].</v>

119

<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get on with it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got a good one actually.</v>

121
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.813

<v Speaker 1>Apparently this is a thing to slake </v>

122
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.323
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

123
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a new one to me,</v>

129
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:46.280

<v Speaker 1>We've got a lot to get to today.</v>

130
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.114
<v Speaker 1>All my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got Alex Jones banned from every </v>

131
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got some thoughts about that.</v>

132
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 1>I think you guys might enjoy listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>to or not.</v>

133
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.823
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the things when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>express your opinion about something </v>

134
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:56.744
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

135
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.703
<v Speaker 1>I liked you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I followed you for years up until this </v>

136
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:00.764
<v Speaker 1>very moment when our opinions diverse on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one thing and now I'm going to </v>

137
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 1>stalk you and threaten your family.</v>

138
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.693
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

139
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>It's just an opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

140
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>You might disagree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just my opinion.</v>

141
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not a right opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's coming up.</v>

142
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Very excited about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ajit pies.</v>

143
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:17.984
<v Speaker 1>Back in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to talk about the fact that </v>

144
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.283
<v Speaker 1>me and Isla trying to have kids and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to a fertility clinic and squirted </v>

145
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.813
<v Speaker 1>in a cup to analyze my semen and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fricking weird and wild experience </v>

146
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 1>that I can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took the pictures.</v>

147
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you that it was something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

148
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:34.544
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of other really exciting </v>

149
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:36.434
<v Speaker 1>headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I you guys are gonna love there was </v>

150
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:42.410
<v Speaker 1>apparently in Louisiana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll save it.</v>

151
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I'll save it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll save it.</v>

152
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:45.020
<v Speaker 1>My dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to save it all,</v>

153
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the goal for the day.</v>

154
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 1>What do we got?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's break the ice.</v>

155
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Does the good for the day work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo.</v>

156
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's break the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Saying,</v>

157
00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pierce Morgan tries to sound smart.</v>

158
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.233
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

159
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.690
<v Speaker 1>On Good Morning Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen this one.</v>

160
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Her forehead's really glowing on her </v>
<v Speaker 1>forehead.</v>

161
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Very Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is for glow.</v>

162
00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:15.314
<v Speaker 1>Like you should think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's trying to be reflective here and </v>

163
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

164
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.473
<v Speaker 1>But that's not a good look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just looks like she got a greasy ass </v>

165
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.300
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

166
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to make fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't make fun of her.</v>

167
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it could be that she was</v>

168
00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:30.920
<v Speaker 1>going for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is makeup for that.</v>

169
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.193
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying if you put her at the </v>

170
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:35.630
<v Speaker 1>top of a light tower and spun her ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

171
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.590
<v Speaker 1>you could probably navigate some ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>

172
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:40.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

173
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.023
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

174
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:43.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

175
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.960
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really not that bad.</v>

176
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.610
<v Speaker 1>So anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

177
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.410
<v Speaker 1>so even a brief history of time,</v>

178
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.670
<v Speaker 3>definitely just avoid those types yet to</v>
<v Speaker 3>treat a girl.</v>

179
00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:59.523
<v Speaker 3>Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read the brief history of time by </v>

180
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.623
<v Speaker 3>Professor Stephen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A brief history of time is that history </v>

181
00:09:04.221 --> 00:09:05.054
<v Speaker 3>is the study into black holes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pythagoras theorem to the nearest five </v>

182
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.693
<v Speaker 3>decimal places.</v>

183
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a favorite color?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like I'm,</v>

184
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm embodied by so much cringe that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to like make her look stupid.</v>

185
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:21.843
<v Speaker 1>Ask Good in understanding that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever read a brief history of time by </v>

186
00:09:25.251 --> 00:09:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Professor Stephen Hawking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like trying to see like,</v>

187
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.403
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dumb.</v>

188
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this girl ever tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound smart.</v>

189
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she ever presumed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>

190
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.153
<v Speaker 1>And then so the genius Piers Morgan </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure being a grown man to try to </v>

191
00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:46.070
<v Speaker 1>humiliate some girl who's obviously not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brightest,</v>

192
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.400
<v Speaker 1>but she's not out here being like trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a Phd dissertation,</v>

193
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's dumb and she knows it.</v>

194
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.533
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever read this book by </v>

195
00:09:57.141 --> 00:10:02.141
<v Speaker 1>Professor Stephen Hawking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has except fucking nerds?</v>

196
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.250
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

197
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.910
<v Speaker 1>she's not up there trying to be smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

198
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.160
<v Speaker 1>what are you trying to disprove?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knows she's dumb.</v>

199
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.881
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

200
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot.</v>

201
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.630
<v Speaker 1>You know that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your point?</v>

202
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.393
<v Speaker 1>And then the best part is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he exposes himself to be the real turd </v>

203
00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:26.120
<v Speaker 1>sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see it.</v>

204
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Three point one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

205
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.140
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's certainly the first four digits.</v>

206
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the best part.</v>

207
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.923
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he named the digits for something </v>

208
00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:47.240
<v Speaker 1>entirely else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pie and he gets it wrong.</v>

209
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that.</v>

210
00:10:50.001 --> 00:10:50.900
<v Speaker 1>That's just what they said.</v>

211
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.860
<v Speaker 3>You knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't you?</v>

212
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.930
<v Speaker 3>Haley was wrong.</v>

213
00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.933
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a normal person when wouldn't </v>

214
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.580
<v Speaker 1>know that pierce yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bip.</v>

215
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.440
<v Speaker 3>You just showed yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even</v>

217
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.080
<v Speaker 1>know how you get back on the TV after </v>
<v Speaker 1>that humiliation,</v>

218
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.470
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a bit of a goof of the day.</v>

219
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.640
<v Speaker 1>What were you saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan?</v>

220
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Ian has an answer about the drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

221
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.383
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just typed that when you said only </v>

222
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:29.890
<v Speaker 1>nerds have read that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian's like,</v>

223
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about.</v>

224
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about picking up booklet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry again.</v>

225
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.493
<v Speaker 1>And it's like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you know the pie to the fifth </v>

226
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.600
<v Speaker 1>digit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

227
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:47.680
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking idiot.</v>

228
00:11:47.681 --> 00:11:49.890
<v Speaker 1>What a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You idiot.</v>

229
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have one other good for the day.</v>

230
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Yoko Ono,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legendary.</v>

231
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 1>A lover soulmate of the great John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lennon artists.</v>

232
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:01.881
<v Speaker 1>Artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

233
00:12:01.881 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to discount her.</v>

234
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 1>She's done so much more than just be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul mate of John,</v>

235
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:07.403
<v Speaker 1>of John Lennon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's come out with a new album and </v>

236
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 1>she released a new single that I thought</v>

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

268
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Or is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're interested in joining some art and</v>

269
00:14:48.111 --> 00:14:53.111
<v Speaker 1>now my dude's onto the main story at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones.</v>

270
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 1>You all know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The notorious conspiracy theorist,</v>

271
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.303
<v Speaker 1>right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say a lot of people consider </v>

272
00:14:59.551 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Speaker 1>them right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing.</v>

273
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't consider them right when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider him an alien.</v>

274
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm making them affiliated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a political party is like trying to</v>

275
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 1>pin down like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what country you exist to on Mars.</v>

276
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like even Martha's to or is to.</v>

277
00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grounded of it.</v>

278
00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the time.</v>

279
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get into that,</v>

280
00:15:26.891 --> 00:15:29.010
<v Speaker 1>but essentially you guys know Alex </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones,</v>

281
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Info wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was recently banned by Youtube,</v>

282
00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.380
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spotify,</v>

283
00:15:38.381 --> 00:15:40.960
<v Speaker 1>and facebook banned all the channels </v>
<v Speaker 1>removed.</v>

284
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.030
<v Speaker 1>He has been making videos since about </v>
<v Speaker 1>early 2001 now.</v>

285
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:46.923
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's mostly known for conspiracy </v>

286
00:15:49.211 --> 00:15:54.211
<v Speaker 1>theories and he's very right leaning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he has a lot of conspiracy theories</v>

287
00:15:54.551 --> 00:15:55.384
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of targeted opinions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Hillary Clinton and Obama and what </v>

288
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.980
<v Speaker 1>do you call the pizza gate stuff he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep into.</v>

289
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.853
<v Speaker 1>I find it kind of interesting if you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back into 2001 just to lay the </v>

290
00:16:09.911 --> 00:16:13.870
<v Speaker 1>groundwork on who this guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in 2001.</v>

291
00:16:13.871 --> 00:16:14.704
<v Speaker 1>I have this clip from waking life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't really a politically </v>

292
00:16:16.991 --> 00:16:19.630
<v Speaker 1>affiliated guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just found this interesting.</v>

293
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.800
<v Speaker 1>He was very much</v>

294
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:26.660
<v Speaker 6>antigovernment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anti-party propaganda,</v>

295
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.520
<v Speaker 6>rolling across the picket line,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lay down,</v>

296
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.863
<v Speaker 6>lay down Gi.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We saw it all about the government </v>

297
00:16:37.051 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 6>system of control.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very much</v>

298
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.510
<v Speaker 1>specifically says in this clip like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a member of any party.</v>

299
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.780
<v Speaker 1>So somehow his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his style has changed since then </v>

318
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.403

319
00:17:40.311 --> 00:17:43.370
<v Speaker 1>specific for videos because it's so hard</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean his shit's been scorched earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Youtube and shit.</v>

326
00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:01.404
<v Speaker 1>which was one of his new greatest hits </v>
<v Speaker 1>of him making a threatening rant about </v>

327
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Robert Mueller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mueller,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but he didn't get it.</v>

330
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm confused.</v>

331
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.813
<v Speaker 1>Were stirred a controversy earlier this </v>
<v Speaker 1>week after it was posted on facebook </v>

332
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:20.280
<v Speaker 1>that it does not appear to have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>uploaded to youtube.</v>

333
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Post on Info wars to the view had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>posted in a news documentary,</v>

334
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 1>scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic contact,</v>

335
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.530
<v Speaker 1>by the way there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the first reach out to info wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yada Yada,</v>

337
00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:31.224
<v Speaker 1>Yada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones channel previously received </v>

338
00:18:33.001 --> 00:18:36.990
<v Speaker 1>strikes from youtube in February after </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoted the false theory that survivors</v>

339
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:37.824
<v Speaker 1>of the Parkland shooting were actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>trained crisis actors that violated </v>

340
00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:42.570
<v Speaker 1>youtube policy against harassment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullying,</v>

341
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.780
<v Speaker 1>but strikes expired three months after </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are issued.</v>

342
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Dot Jones channel currently had just one</v>
<v Speaker 1>strike against him.</v>

343
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:49.643
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually was able to find the clip of </v>

344
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:55.680
<v Speaker 1>him talking about Robert Muller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

345
00:18:55.681 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

346
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

347
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.990
<v Speaker 1>let's see what kind of stuff this guy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying you the question right now,</v>

348
00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 1>the real debate is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this a,</v>

349
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.913
<v Speaker 1>it's being framed by the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>support Alex Jones as a political </v>

350
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.943
<v Speaker 1>silencing that he's being shut down </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all these big tech companies </v>

351
00:19:14.911 --> 00:19:18.300
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are super liberal leaning and it's a,</v>

352
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a political shut down,</v>

353
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's censorship,</v>

354
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

355
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:24.534
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well like some of the videos they </v>

356
00:19:26.221 --> 00:19:29.680
<v Speaker 1>described could easily be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely open to debate.</v>

357
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like pushing the children to the</v>

358
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:32.400
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

359
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to see that.</v>

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here I have this one of molar,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let me pop this baby open.</v>

362
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just happened very recently.</v>

363
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Muir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's so scared of Mueller.</v>

364
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.290
<v Speaker 1>So I'm saying in front of people what </v>
<v Speaker 1>she did.</v>

365
00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.213
<v Speaker 1>So here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what he's saying about one </v>

366
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.353
<v Speaker 1>sheets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mueller molar is like a lifelong </v>

367
00:19:57.371 --> 00:19:59.320

<v Speaker 1>solid.</v>

368
00:19:59.321 --> 00:20:00.154
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the most beautiful guys </v>

369
00:20:01.751 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now everyone looks at Mola,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but a lot of lot of people see them as </v>

371
00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:12.090
<v Speaker 1>like a total piece of shit con man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember Donald Trump tweeting out</v>

372
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 1>when the investigation started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

373
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad it's molar because he's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>respected.</v>

374
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.530
<v Speaker 1>So now all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we're saying about Mueller,</v>

375
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.230
<v Speaker 1>everyone's so scared of Mueller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mueller,</v>

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.780
<v Speaker 1>rape kids in front of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What she did mean,</v>

377
00:20:23.781 --> 00:20:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Mueller covered up for a decade for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Epstein kidnapping kids,</v>

378
00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:30.930
<v Speaker 1>flying them on sex planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some kids as young as seven years old,</v>

379
00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:35.550
<v Speaker 1>reportedly with big perverts raping them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to frame people.</v>

380
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mueller is a monster man.</v>

381
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.473
<v Speaker 1>Cod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine he's even above the pedophiles </v>

382
00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:44.190
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Gonna Happen.</v>

413
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.370
<v Speaker 7>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Walk out the square politically high,</v>

414
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.750

<v Speaker 7>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not a joke.</v>

417
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.990
<v Speaker 7>That's not a gain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So real world politically,</v>

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.090
<v Speaker 7>you're going to get it or I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>try a bitch.</v>

419
00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.710
<v Speaker 7>I didn't notice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You actually was saying</v>

420
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.570
<v Speaker 1>politically right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

421
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does he mean by that?</v>

422
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't.</v>

423
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.420
<v Speaker 1>It's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's very.</v>

424
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:34.063
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're accusing somebody of like </v>

425
00:22:35.361 --> 00:22:39.740
<v Speaker 1>basically raping kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we hold that in our culture to be</v>

426
00:22:39.741 --> 00:22:40.574
<v Speaker 1>one of the worst things possible to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point that where you don't even respect </v>

427
00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:45.080
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you degrade someone to the point of</v>

428
00:22:45.081 --> 00:22:48.020
<v Speaker 1>being a child rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really when you're saying,</v>

429
00:22:48.021 --> 00:22:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

430
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If somebody goes,</v>

431
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.440
<v Speaker 1>if somebody who believes that he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedophile goes and murders him,</v>

432
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.903
<v Speaker 1>am I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if were to believe that he's actually </v>

433
00:22:57.501 --> 00:23:00.200
<v Speaker 1>like organizing a massive pedophile </v>
<v Speaker 1>ring,</v>

434
00:23:00.201 --> 00:23:01.640
<v Speaker 1>how much sympathy do you have for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy?</v>

435
00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

436
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:05.960
<v Speaker 1>this shit you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really.</v>

437
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he's just doing a character,</v>

438
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.713
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like a overexaggerating everything </v>

439
00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:16.250
<v Speaker 1>and it could be entertaining when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it through that Lens,</v>

440
00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.113
<v Speaker 1>but from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people take him seriously and </v>

441
00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.670
<v Speaker 1>believe that he's believing what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

442
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.060
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think he really believes what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

443
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:30.640
<v Speaker 1>like about all the crazy stuff that he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

444
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.900
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely debatable.</v>

445
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:37.690

483
00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.180
<v Speaker 1>I was criticizing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were analyzing the situation.</v>

484

<v Speaker 1>What are the how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who watched that and thought to himself,</v>

485
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.063
<v Speaker 1>this needs to be taken down right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was literally just talking about how </v>

486
00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:10.310
<v Speaker 1>he defamed Robert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Mueller,</v>

487
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Mueller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

488
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:13.394
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what we could do to make the </v>

489
00:26:15.231 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 1>situation even worse for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

490
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.290
<v Speaker 1>this was like a beautiful play by them </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

491
00:26:21.291 --> 00:26:26.291
<v Speaker 1>Like in one fell swoop we can turn ethan</v>
<v Speaker 1>against us who's usually critical bus,</v>

492
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.790
<v Speaker 1>but in this time he's defending us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can.</v>

493
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones was an explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive situation.</v>

494
00:26:31.401 --> 00:26:32.234
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's saying that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory to censor the right </v>

495
00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:38.030
<v Speaker 1>wing media and one fell swoop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we do?</v>

496
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all fit and think I've got it.</v>

497
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Strike their live screaming or remove </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ability to</v>

498
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.730
<v Speaker 3>broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me look at my context.</v>

499
00:26:49.731 --> 00:26:53.970
<v Speaker 3>We do have Ethan's number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could reach out to him real quick and</v>

500
00:26:53.971 --> 00:26:54.960
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

501
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

502
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:57.624
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

503
00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

504
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

505
00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

506
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Let's be reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

507
00:27:01.971 --> 00:27:02.804
<v Speaker 1>this is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say this is so dumb because </v>

508
00:27:04.671 --> 00:27:05.504
<v Speaker 1>now the people that I was criticizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to use this as evidence to </v>

509
00:27:10.041 --> 00:27:10.610
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

510
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:11.443
<v Speaker 1>this is proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a conspiracy against this after </v>

511
00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:13.964
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>

512
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.490
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me now to argue against </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

513
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand how fucking stupid you</v>

<v Speaker 1>a coordinated attack.</v>

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 1>We have friends with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

818
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.800
<v Speaker 1>it's been two years.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I hate my life.</v>

821
00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:30.730
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

822
00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:33.330
<v Speaker 1>kids are the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

823
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:36.510
<v Speaker 1>kids are the best thing you'll ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile it's like,</v>

824
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get any sleep.</v>

825
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I have to leave every time we hang out </v>
<v Speaker 1>at 3:00</v>

826
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:42.683
<v Speaker 1>PM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried praying to escape my family </v>

827
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:46.860
<v Speaker 1>for any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For five minutes at a time.</v>

828
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really great.</v>

829
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:52.103
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

830
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.430
<v Speaker 3>why do we all want to do it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves?</v>

831
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Why do you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do we want kids?</v>

832
00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Like what is wrong with us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just we have a shredder is perfect.</v>

833
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a perfect angel.</v>

834
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.513
<v Speaker 3>Like as perfectly as could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember how happy we were when we </v>

835
00:45:06.691 --> 00:45:09.330
<v Speaker 3>left them at home for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or we took them to the groomer yesterday</v>

836
00:45:09.331 --> 00:45:12.120
<v Speaker 3>for like three hours and we left them at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the groomer.</v>

837
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:15.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm still paranoid about what happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>in those three hours though.</v>

838
00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:16.560
<v Speaker 3>We weren't with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

839
00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.313
<v Speaker 1>I have a fear that they put a finger up </v>
<v Speaker 1>his ass or something in a weird way </v>

840
00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.950
<v Speaker 1>because this dark rumors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you the truth.</v>

841
00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:25.933
<v Speaker 1>Our groomers are fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman who receives him doesn't have </v>

842
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.690
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's literally toothless,</v>

843
00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:33.670
<v Speaker 1>which she has like a nub,</v>

844
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:36.540
<v Speaker 3>but it's not in the way in her mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a weird.</v>

845
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like a really nice place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

846
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:43.320
<v Speaker 3>But I have to say main local area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not like we're taking him to a</v>

847
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 3>weird place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're taking him to a nice place.</v>

848
00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five star reviews or whatever,</v>

849
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.200
<v Speaker 3>but in my mind if I were to imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

850
00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:52.460
<v Speaker 1>lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck's dogs.</v>

851
00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:57.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she goes shut.</v>

852
00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Has this move when he cuddles with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he looks inside your ear?</v>

853
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so she goes,</v>

854
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.510
<v Speaker 3>she says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

855
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.380
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know where you're going with it and no</v>

856
00:46:09.381 --> 00:46:12.450
<v Speaker 3>one this thought in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't know what happened,</v>

857
00:46:12.451 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 3>but she says to me when we went to pick </v>
<v Speaker 3>them up,</v>

858
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.061
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

859
00:46:15.061 --> 00:46:16.080
<v Speaker 3>that's his mobile phone.</v>

860
00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:18.280
<v Speaker 1>That he licks in the ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

861
00:46:18.281 --> 00:46:19.990
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like shutter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also like,</v>

862
00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:25.290
<v Speaker 1>what situation is he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is he up there?</v>

863
00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.330
<v Speaker 1>What was she doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was she.</v>

864
00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Why was he is capable of putting his </v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue and our ear.</v>

865
00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:32.530
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking he gives good head</v>

866
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.020
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking.</v>

867
00:46:34.021 --> 00:46:34.854
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was always afraid that you're </v>

868
00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.250
<v Speaker 3>going to say that she was enjoying it or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

869
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:42.140
<v Speaker 3>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

870
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't like peanut butter,</v>

871
00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:50.890
<v Speaker 3>natural food that imagine what her mouth</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like.</v>

872
00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.830
<v Speaker 3>Imagine what her job looks</v>

873
00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:56.990
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

874
00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 1>probably got rotting teeth in the I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

875
00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

876
00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:08.200
<v Speaker 1>So and so for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at any rate,</v>

877
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:12.550
<v Speaker 1>imagine having a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You leave your dog for three hours,</v>

878
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.350
<v Speaker 1>have to sick thoughts you have in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

879
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.440
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>

880
00:47:17.441 --> 00:47:22.441
<v Speaker 1>I went to a for tenor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for tilty clinic to analyze my semen.</v>

881
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:28.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny situation that I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>

882
00:47:28.211 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checks out my sIemens great.</v>

883
00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Let me normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like,</v>

884
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:35.163
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're assuming that the duck is like </v>

885
00:47:37.151 --> 00:47:39.040
<v Speaker 1>your semen is insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

886
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.690
<v Speaker 1>That's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said it's normal.</v>

887
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.600
<v Speaker 1>That's dank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seen as normal.</v>

888
00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.150
<v Speaker 1>That's dang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

889
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:50.770
<v Speaker 1>you go to this little so it's just this </v>
<v Speaker 1>little office.</v>

890
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.113
<v Speaker 1>they bring into this back a little room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they bring you into this room and </v>

891
00:47:55.421 --> 00:47:55.901
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

892
00:47:55.901 --> 00:48:00.670
<v Speaker 1>well here's a cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you jerk and do and when you're done you</v>

893
00:48:00.671 --> 00:48:03.340
<v Speaker 1>bring it out and there's like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

894
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.593
<v Speaker 1>little window you open and then you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cup in and you close it and I guess </v>

895
00:48:07.811 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 1>some other person back there gargles it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the same.</v>

896
00:48:12.371 --> 00:48:15.010
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

897
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:15.933
<v Speaker 1>whatever they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I didn't even think about this </v>

898
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:19.510
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be funny though,</v>

899
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.823
<v Speaker 1>because you imagine there's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced machinery and they looking at </v>

900
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:23.974
<v Speaker 1>it under a telescope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just some fucking weirdo </v>

901
00:48:25.691 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 1>gargles up like it's a little on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weak side.</v>

902
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advanced Machinery.</v>

903
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a funny thought.</v>

904
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:34.703
<v Speaker 1>Hilo.</v>

905
00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked into the room and I was.</v>

00:50:13.681 --> 00:50:15.260
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine touching that.</v>

935
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.680
<v Speaker 1>The sticky assets white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

936
00:50:18.681 --> 00:50:20.150
<v Speaker 1>it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's magazines.</v>

937
00:50:20.151 --> 00:50:20.984
<v Speaker 1>It's on the wall and hustlers and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like this has been handled by </v>

938
00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 1>thousands of dudes who have jerked </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

939
00:50:27.381 --> 00:50:28.214
<v Speaker 1>You imagine touching that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to wear like a hazmat suit when </v>

940
00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:33.320
<v Speaker 1>you walk into this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dropped.</v>

941
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I walked in,</v>

942
00:50:34.761 --> 00:50:39.130
<v Speaker 1>we'll wait till you see the chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

943
00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.233
<v Speaker 1>just the look of this chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing you see when you </v>

944
00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:46.040
<v Speaker 1>walk in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like a torture chair.</v>

945
00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a pee pad,</v>

946
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:51.650
<v Speaker 1>like striders pee pads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

947
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:53.870
<v Speaker 1>it's like you to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine,</v>

948
00:50:53.871 --> 00:50:54.704
<v Speaker 1>I'll totally jerk off in that chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that you've covered it with it's a </v>

949
00:50:57.821 --> 00:50:58.654
<v Speaker 1>pee pad.</v>

950
00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.300
<v Speaker 1>What to do and they expect the year like</v>
<v Speaker 1>get naked and sit on that.</v>

951
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to do what you gotta do.</v>

952
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:07.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the only chair in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a standing up.</v>

953
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I just dropped trial and I just got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just banged it out a little quick.</v>

954
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.550
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much in this chair was </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered,</v>

955
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I would not say it on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

956
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:22.350
<v Speaker 1>I was horrified when I walked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I decided to get my camera.</v>

957
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:23.330
<v Speaker 1>When I saw this chair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

958
00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:26.500
<v Speaker 1>this is unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they expect that you're going to</v>

959
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:30.020
<v Speaker 1>jerk off onto the chair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

960
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:31.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some weird dudes are into this.</v>

961
00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:35.570
<v Speaker 1>They probably don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do this every week.</v>

962
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.070
<v Speaker 1>They really don't even need the </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

963
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:40.100
<v Speaker 1>It just turns them on what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

964
00:51:40.101 --> 00:51:41.330
<v Speaker 1>So gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the cup.</v>

965
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:47.270
<v Speaker 1>So you crack it open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the deed and then you have to put</v>

966
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:48.800
<v Speaker 1>the exact time you squirted.</v>

967
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.580
<v Speaker 1>So it was like 1153 and you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact minute.</v>

968
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:53.890
<v Speaker 1>And what is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so huge,</v>

969
00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:55.160
<v Speaker 1>because I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

970
00:51:55.190 --> 00:52:00.190
<v Speaker 1>over time the semen degrades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So lIke the minute matters.</v>

971
00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like right next to the tv remote.</v>

972
00:52:03.591 --> 00:52:04.424
<v Speaker 1>So potentially my semen could be even </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger and they were just a couple </v>

973
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:08.740
<v Speaker 1>minutes off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

974
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Imagine touching anything in that room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've got a tv with like porn on it</v>

975
00:52:14.751 --> 00:52:17.420
<v Speaker 1>and you can put the headphones off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit in the chair and jerk off,</v>

976
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.970
<v Speaker 1>which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just stood right there.</v>

977
00:52:19.971 --> 00:52:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I scored it All over the fucking chair </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>

978
00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:26.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did look at this trashcan full of rag.</v>

979
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even emPty.</v>

980
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:31.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was when I walked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fall.</v>

981
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Rags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at least trashcan we to toP up.</v>

982
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Close up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it had funds on the ground?</v>

983
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's just a little.</v>

984
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.600
<v Speaker 1>So here's the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some lube,</v>

985
00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:49.970
<v Speaker 1>a tiny really old tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

986
00:52:49.971 --> 00:52:51.500
<v Speaker 1>gosh didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>

987
00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:54.050
<v Speaker 1>It cost money to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

988
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:56.840
<v Speaker 1>it was like 200 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's with the shoot it wrong?</v>

989
00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:02.170
<v Speaker 1>They don't even have money for like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicer tv stand.</v>

990
00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:05.720
<v Speaker 1>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all going to be on this tiny look.</v>

991
00:53:05.721 --> 00:53:06.554
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know ladies needs some kind of </v>

992
00:53:09.171 --> 00:53:10.580
<v Speaker 1>romancing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>

993
00:53:10.581 --> 00:53:11.450
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking dropped trial it.</v>

995
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:17.420

996
00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No sound.</v>

997
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.390
<v Speaker 1>One minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to spend another second in</v>

998
00:53:23.391 --> 00:53:25.560
<v Speaker 1>there just by being in there with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>dick out.</v>

999
00:53:25.561 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to get worse oral </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1000
00:53:28.351 --> 00:53:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks empty.</v>

1001
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:33.450
<v Speaker 1>It's very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will get a lot of use.</v>

1002
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:34.523
<v Speaker 1>I mean just imagine like imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're about to jerk off with this lube </v>

1003
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.540
<v Speaker 1>and you have to touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the act of squirting it out.</v>

1004
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.983
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're not aware of how gross</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to go in there and like a full </v>

1005

1007
00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:55.910
<v Speaker 1>But then the weird thing is like you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the room and then you,</v>

1008
00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:56.853
<v Speaker 1>you do it in the cup and you bring it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and then you have to go back in the </v>

1009
00:53:58.891 --> 00:53:59.890
<v Speaker 1>lobby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet the merck,</v>

1010

1011
00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:04.464
<v Speaker 1>aged woman who's just turned it off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you go to bailing and some old </v>

<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows you're jerking off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all good.</v>

1015
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Here's the interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we all did our test.</v>

1016
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.273
<v Speaker 1>Everything is normal so maybe we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not have a kid because it's a sign </v>

1017
00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:31.734
<v Speaker 1>from god.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:45.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:54:45.931 --> 00:54:46.764
<v Speaker 1>You just sheepishly walk out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sit your ass in another lobby and </v>

1021
00:54:49.501 --> 00:54:51.690
<v Speaker 1>everyone's staring at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to just jerked off.</v>

1022
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:53.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what you feel like it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking.</v>

1023
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it all day.</v>

1024
00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:56.840
<v Speaker 1>They don't even care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1025
00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:57.723
<v Speaker 1>they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if they ever see a guy like walk </v>

1026
00:55:01.171 --> 00:55:03.390
<v Speaker 1>out and there's like some jazz on a shoe</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something?</v>

1027

<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

1028
00:55:09.721 --> 00:55:11.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for error in there.</v>

1029
00:55:11.611 --> 00:55:16.611
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty wild stuff.</v>

00:56:14.941 --> 00:56:17.670
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just realized.</v>

1049
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.530
<v Speaker 1>How long has this been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dan?</v>

1050
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1051
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 1>because all of the starting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping.</v>

1052
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:25.960
<v Speaker 3>A little tough to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see,</v>

1053
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:30.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably just about an hour.</v>

1054
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 3>The episodes an hour long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

1055
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:36.220
<v Speaker 3>It feels like we've been here for like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

1056
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:38.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're actually probably under an</v>

1057
00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:41.020
<v Speaker 3>hour or even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We've been recording for a 16 minutes </v>

1060
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:53.230
<v Speaker 3>since we came back in from the sponsor </v>
<v Speaker 3>read and I think we broke it.</v>

1061
00:56:53.231 --> 00:56:56.620
<v Speaker 3>The 35 minute mark sponsor reads about </v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes long.</v>

1062
00:56:56.621 --> 00:56:58.810
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about an hour.</v>

<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1069
00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:32.590
<v Speaker 1>so ajit pi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chairman of the fcc lied to congress</v>

1070
00:57:33.081 --> 00:57:36.470
<v Speaker 1>about allegedly cyber attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That didn't actually happen.</v>

1071
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:40.550
<v Speaker 1>So when you guys remember this huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle for net neutrality,</v>

1072
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:43.150
<v Speaker 1>we actually made a podcast about it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.660
<v Speaker 1>let me show this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean this one here?</v>

1074
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I love the framing of that shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't talk.</v>

1075
00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.460
<v Speaker 1>You can't ever complain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1076
00:57:49.461 --> 00:57:51.950
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad photo of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When like your,</v>

1077
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:56.620
<v Speaker 1>your actual headshot looks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this guy just,</v>

1078
00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:58.790
<v Speaker 1>he looks goofy in every photo.</v>

1079
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:01.303
<v Speaker 6>Come on,</v>

1080
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.460
<v Speaker 1>like that's his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the picture on the wall.</v>

1081
00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.313
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1082
00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:13.050
<v Speaker 3>this is the guy I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about him.</v>

1083
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:18.320
<v Speaker 1>So ajit pi during this huge raging </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate about net neutrality,</v>

1084
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:22.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

1085
00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't muster the strength to care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this is this so hard?</v>

1086
00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:36.080
<v Speaker 3>So I mean it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to do the failed episode.</v>

1087
00:58:36.081 --> 00:58:38.150
<v Speaker 3>What we planned is not anYmore</v>

1088
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:40.223
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said they got so many people that </v>

1089
00:58:42.331 --> 00:58:43.950
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

1090
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I want net neutrality that their website</v>
<v Speaker 1>crashed.</v>

1091
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:50.490
<v Speaker 1>And they were like see how bad we want </v>
<v Speaker 1>net neutrality.</v>

1092
00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:51.413
<v Speaker 1>And the fcc was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually you guys have greatly </v>

1093
00:58:56.610 --> 00:58:57.443
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated how many people have come </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the reason our website got shut </v>

1094
00:59:01.651 --> 00:59:02.484
<v Speaker 1>down is because we were hacked and ddoss</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked by people trying to make it </v>

1095
00:59:09.001 --> 00:59:11.190
<v Speaker 1>look like there was more people than </v>
<v Speaker 1>there were.</v>

1096
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:12.503
<v Speaker 3>So they just made a bright light because</v>
<v Speaker 3>these such a little fucking bitch look </v>

1097
00:59:17.701 --> 00:59:18.534
<v Speaker 3>at the house.</v>

1098
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Like how</v>

1099
00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:22.943
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a whole team that has to agree </v>

1100
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.330
<v Speaker 3>on that statement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes ma'am.</v>

1101
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:27.620
<v Speaker 3>And they all agreed.</v>

1102
00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.473
<v Speaker 1>So at first came out by like their their</v>
<v Speaker 1>tech person and then ajit pi boy came </v>

1103
00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:35.404
<v Speaker 1>out and did a press conference in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of congress and said we were ddoss </v>

1104
00:59:39.911 --> 00:59:40.744
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now everybody knows about tech was </v>

1105
00:59:42.221 --> 00:59:44.770
<v Speaker 1>looking at it and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence.</v>

1106
00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:45.693
<v Speaker 1>We're almost certain that didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he came to the point where it was </v>

1107
00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:51.040
<v Speaker 1>pretty much proven that they will never </v>
<v Speaker 1>d dos attack.</v>

1108
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:53.680
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theY're now forced to just recently,</v>

1109
00:59:53.681 --> 00:59:54.514
<v Speaker 1>August 8th to admit that they lied about</v>
<v Speaker 1>an alleged cyber attack that didn't </v>

1110
00:59:59.021 --> 01:00:04.021
<v Speaker 1>actually ever happened because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like such idiots.</v>

1111
01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:07.183
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not surprised this is the guy </v>

1112
01:00:09.701 --> 01:00:14.701
<v Speaker 1>who made those videos about net </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutrality in his santa suit.</v>

1113
01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.533
<v Speaker 3>So when do they get any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>punishment for lying about it and in a </v>

1114
01:00:21.641 --> 01:00:22.474
<v Speaker 3>sane world,</v>

1115
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>but my friend that is far from the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in,</v>

1116
01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.313
<v Speaker 1>but just know that this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got a pie in the face but it's not </v>

1117
01:00:33.081 --> 01:00:34.480
<v Speaker 1>the first and won't be the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1118
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I think this guY's just use them cream </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over his face.</v>

1119
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1120
01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:40.693
<v Speaker 1>If his face got creamed anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd looked like the chair in that </v>

1121
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

1122
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>I know I got through that store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else would go film academy awards.</v>

1123
01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:02.090
<v Speaker 1>New category at the academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you call those?</v>

1124
01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>The oscars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you call those?</v>

1125
01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oscars new category at the oscars.</v>

1126
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:09.343
<v Speaker 1>Outstanding achievement and popular film</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all the popular films never get </v>

1127
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:17.690
<v Speaker 1>nominated because it's all this art </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit that nobody's fucking watched.</v>

1128
01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.400
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of agree like the shape of water.</v>

1129
01:01:21.401 --> 01:01:23.350
<v Speaker 3>Who cared about that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>

1130
01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:24.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1131
01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:28.580
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one before was one day before it was</v>

1132

1133

<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen that one,</v>

1134
01:01:33.361 --> 01:01:34.194
<v Speaker 3>so I can't tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I saw when I was traveling to </v>

1135

1136
01:01:38.641 --> 01:01:41.190
<v Speaker 3>so I saw the shape of water and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>She fucks a fish.</v>

1139
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:47.190
<v Speaker 3>She falls in love with him for no </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

1140
01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The storY was so weird.</v>

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:56.963
<v Speaker 3>It's a chick flick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about the power of love when a </v>

1145
01:01:59.551 --> 01:02:00.750
<v Speaker 3>bitch can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

1146
01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:03.750
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should've framed like that when a girl</v>

1147
01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.300
<v Speaker 3>I didn't make a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a bit.</v>

1148
01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:06.640
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeAh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.230
<v Speaker 3>Because she can't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's so misunderstood.</v>

1154
01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.710
<v Speaker 3>She's mute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That true love can still find you in end</v>

01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:23.563
<v Speaker 3>and the form of a giant fish cock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a fish monster or </v>

1263
01:08:21.021 --> 01:08:21.854
<v Speaker 1>being used to train deep learning ai so </v>

1268
01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:51.310
<v Speaker 1>there will be new jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you know there is a problem.</v>

1269
01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean like historically it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't ride horses anymore,</v>

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.313
<v Speaker 1>but it's like before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's shrinking because automation </v>

1275
01:09:12.850 --> 01:09:15.400
<v Speaker 1>automation was ever a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifting fields.</v>

1276
01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:16.511
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

01:09:16.511 --> 01:09:17.344
<v Speaker 1>we don't need people to raise horses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now we're building cars and it's a </v>

1278
01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:23.710
<v Speaker 1>new field or like you don't need people </v>

<v Speaker 1>But automation is a different issue </v>

1281
01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:35.450

<v Speaker 1>and they thought there's an alien </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaceship.</v>

1337
01:12:09.751 --> 01:12:12.120
<v Speaker 1>The mothership that cruises behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comment.</v>

1338
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.580
<v Speaker 1>And if they kill themselves when it's </v>

<v Speaker 1>they go up to the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know why they are.</v>

1340
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Why are they so eager to get on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaceship in?</v>

1341
01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.980
<v Speaker 1>We'll be able to answer that for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on on that spaceship that's</v>

1342
01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:25.230
<v Speaker 1>so dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parties.</v>

1343
01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all like,</v>

1344
01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.280
<v Speaker 1>we've determined that this nike is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>freshest.</v>

1345
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:31.223
<v Speaker 1>We want to bring these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder if today would be easiest </v>

1346
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.673
<v Speaker 1>or what.</v>

1347
01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.360
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1348
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:39.720
<v Speaker 1>these yeezys are the fresh issue for </v>
<v Speaker 1>eternity.</v>

1349
01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:41.873
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is some guys are going to be </v>

1350
01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:47.400
<v Speaker 1>hard it to get 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are you kidding me?</v>

1351
01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:48.923
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1352
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.050
<v Speaker 1>so they died and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1353
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.943
<v Speaker 1>and so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two of them that they left </v>

1354
01:12:55.081 --> 01:12:58.230
<v Speaker 1>behind to maintain the website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious in its own right.</v>

1355
01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:03.650
<v Speaker 1>So here is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their original art here.</v>

1356
01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Heaven's gate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty sick honestly.</v>

1357
01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:09.613
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As was promised the keys to heaven's </v>

1358
01:13:10.831 --> 01:13:14.610
<v Speaker 1>gate are here again in that font is kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tricky.</v>

1359
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.133
<v Speaker 1>And to and do the u of o two as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in jesus and his father 2000 years </v>

1360
01:13:21.961 --> 01:13:23.430
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1361
01:13:23.431 --> 01:13:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I guess there are theories that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed.</v>

1362
01:13:25.111 --> 01:13:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Last time it passed was when jesus was </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

1363
01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:28.793
<v Speaker 1>So he jumped on up to the spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of dumb ass plot is that of </v>

1364
01:13:32.851 --> 01:13:33.270
<v Speaker 1>jesus?</v>

1365
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:34.103
<v Speaker 1>To be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yo,</v>

1366
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I came to this planet to create life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>die for all your sins.</v>

1367
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:40.703
<v Speaker 1>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My spaceship only comes around every </v>

1368
01:13:42.841 --> 01:13:45.270
<v Speaker 1>2000 years you're going to be wearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1369
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Can't be wearing the freshest shoes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know jesus was the ultimate sneakerhead.</v>

1370
01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Graphic design is insane.</v>

1371
01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:57.660
<v Speaker 1>And like the gate looks like a key so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

1372
01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.420
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1373
01:13:59.570 --> 01:14:04.570
<v Speaker 1>and his new album art was here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you obviously like,</v>

1374
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you want to call it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>parody,</v>

1375
01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:12.051
<v Speaker 1>but obviously really heavily inspired by</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and frankly it's so sick there.</v>

1376
01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:16.480
<v Speaker 1>is this better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 10>they all had it on their shoulders,</v>

1524
01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:09.210
<v Speaker 10>sec,</v>

<v Speaker 10>regarding,</v>
<v Speaker 10>for around $800.</v>

1527
01:22:14.371 --> 01:22:17.430
<v Speaker 10>Right now it's pretty ordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The shoe,</v>

1528
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:23.990
<v Speaker 10>the shoe itself isn't that nice?</v>
<v Speaker 10>But yeah,</v>

1529
01:22:24.361 --> 01:22:27.660
<v Speaker 10>it's interesting how that's appealing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But uh,</v>

1530
01:22:27.810 --> 01:22:28.643
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 10>I'm in.</v>

1533
01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:33.203
<v Speaker 10>I'm fascinated by the fact that some of </v>
<v Speaker 10>these guys were left behind apple juice </v>

1534
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:39.083
<v Speaker 10>or not to chug that.</v>

<v Speaker 10>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

1536
01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.320
<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They're left behind specifically to do a</v>

1537
01:22:43.321 --> 01:22:45.480
<v Speaker 10>cup just to maintain the website.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

1538
01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:47.610
<v Speaker 10>I asked them about that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

1539
01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:48.870
<v Speaker 10>am I getting ahead of myself?</v>

1541
01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:51.960
<v Speaker 10>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So this is their website,</v>

1542
01:22:51.961 --> 01:22:56.961
<v Speaker 10>like as it looks today,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it hasn't changed since 1997 motif.</v>

1543
01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.630
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>they really stuck with it.</v>

1544
01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:02.963
<v Speaker 10>So I was just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I spoke with remaining member to get </v>

1545
01:23:04.891 --> 01:23:09.891
<v Speaker 10>some clarification.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So my first thing I said,</v>

1546
01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:12.730
<v Speaker 10>how do you heard of [inaudible] before?</v>
<v Speaker 10>What do you think of his music?</v>

1547
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.310
<v Speaker 10>Who designed the original logo is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 10>high catching.</v>

1548
01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:16.950
<v Speaker 10>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

1549
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.840
<v Speaker 10>we did not hear of him before the 31st.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Very sPecific.</v>

1550
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.323
<v Speaker 10>We know nothing of his music.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It was designed by a couple members of </v>

1551
01:23:24.761 --> 01:23:26.350
<v Speaker 10>the group in the spring of [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 10>96.</v>

1552
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:29.090
<v Speaker 10>So a year before they all said,</v>

<v Speaker 10>cooperated heaven's gate,</v>

1555
01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:39.820

<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

1558
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:47.720

<v Speaker 10>what do you think of people using it?</v>

1559
01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:50.520
<v Speaker 10>and you can see the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1564
01:23:59.441 --> 01:24:00.940

<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>

1565
01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:01.893
<v Speaker 10>Do you find it upsetting or are you glad</v>
<v Speaker 10>to see that heaven's gate is impacting </v>

1566
01:24:04.671 --> 01:24:07.450
<v Speaker 10>and popular culture?</v>
<v Speaker 10>What is the appeal?</v>

1567
01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.510
<v Speaker 10>Really good questions.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I was getting curious.</v>

1568
01:24:10.511 --> 01:24:11.344
<v Speaker 10>They sent me a whole a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they understand that it's pervaded the </v>

1569
01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:15.334
<v Speaker 10>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but frank ocean was not infringing on </v>

1570
01:24:16.631 --> 01:24:18.640
<v Speaker 10>logos so,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so they're not upset,</v>

1571
01:24:18.650 --> 01:24:23.280

1573
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.010
<v Speaker 10>Can we just acknowledge this is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 10>insane?</v>

1574
01:24:27.011 --> 01:24:28.470
<v Speaker 10>That means having a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:30.391
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1576
01:24:30.391 --> 01:24:33.490
<v Speaker 10>Where did he touch with them?</v>
<v Speaker 10>They have you can reach out.</v>

1577
01:24:33.491 --> 01:24:37.780
<v Speaker 10>That's all they do is answer emails.</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's damn one of their main thing.</v>

1578
01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:39.393
<v Speaker 10>They dOn't have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They do.</v>

1579

<v Speaker 10>I don't say what.</v>
<v Speaker 10>No.</v>

1580
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.520
<v Speaker 10>I have an idea of what it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but they didn't explicitly say,</v>

1581
01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:48.130
<v Speaker 10>what's your idea?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Does that later can't waIt?</v>

1582
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:51.310
<v Speaker 10>So they told me that they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 10>bothered by that.</v>

1583
01:24:51.311 --> 01:24:53.470
<v Speaker 10>They know that their information is </v>
<v Speaker 10>controversial.</v>

1584
01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:54.483
<v Speaker 10>Artists reflect the social discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Many are interested in the inner </v>

1585
01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:02.410
<v Speaker 10>information and that the generation z </v>
<v Speaker 10>group wants to learn more and are not as</v>

01:25:02.411 --> 01:25:04.870
<v Speaker 10>put off as others have been over 21 </v>
<v Speaker 10>years.</v>

1587
01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:06.093
<v Speaker 10>We're not here to waste our time.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Eventually they want to see the planet </v>

1588
01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:13.810
<v Speaker 10>and breakthrough with their information.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We're not here to harm mankind.</v>

1591
01:25:20.291 --> 01:25:21.124
<v Speaker 10>hoping to see the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I've come to understand that the next </v>

1592
01:25:23.951 --> 01:25:24.784
<v Speaker 10>level,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's kind of what they call heaven is </v>

1593
01:25:26.051 --> 01:25:29.560
<v Speaker 10>only accessible every 2000 or so years </v>
<v Speaker 10>with the passing of the comment.</v>

1594
01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:30.843
<v Speaker 10>is that the only way to get there,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's estimated to return in the year </v>

1595
01:25:33.491 --> 01:25:37.150
<v Speaker 10>4,380.</v>

<v Speaker 10>millennium is by way of reincarnation </v>

1599
01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:48.480
<v Speaker 10>because they believe in reincarnation.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They kind sassed me a little bit here.</v>

1603
01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:01.690

1660
01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:52.220
<v Speaker 10>I think I'm jumping from one to the </v>
<v Speaker 10>other in these responses.</v>

1661
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:54.860
<v Speaker 10>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>they must be on the older side,</v>

1662
01:28:54.861 --> 01:28:59.861

<v Speaker 10>the cold started around the seventies.</v>

<v Speaker 10>Michelle emojis.</v>

1665
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:08.303
<v Speaker 10>I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is your primary directive to manage the </v>

1666
01:29:10.141 --> 01:29:13.410
<v Speaker 10>website and answer inquiries?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Do you have other duties?</v>

1667
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:16.860
<v Speaker 10>I was reading some of the guidelines for</v>
<v Speaker 10>the group and they're really restrictive</v>

1668
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:19.680
<v Speaker 10>down to like they were instructing how </v>
<v Speaker 10>big your pancakes could be.</v>

1669
01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:21.323
<v Speaker 10>A just for dietary purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 10>do you have hobbies outside of heaven's </v>

1670
01:29:24.631 --> 01:29:25.810
<v Speaker 10>gate?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Maybe your favorite movie,</v>

1671
01:29:25.811 --> 01:29:26.644
<v Speaker 10>your favorite album?</v>
<v Speaker 10>I was hoping that they'd given me </v>

1672
01:29:28.771 --> 01:29:30.510
<v Speaker 10>something.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1673
01:29:30.511 --> 01:29:33.180
<v Speaker 10>or like we love like nacho libra or </v>
<v Speaker 10>something,</v>

1674
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:36.630
<v Speaker 10>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>some did internet stuff,</v>

1675
01:29:36.631 --> 01:29:37.464
<v Speaker 10>media coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 10>One was assigned to production tasks </v>

1676
01:29:39.121 --> 01:29:43.530
<v Speaker 10>with filmmakers that didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I actually found that story.</v>

1677
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:45.183
<v Speaker 10>There was a producer to make the film </v>
<v Speaker 10>and he went on tv and was talking about </v>

1678
01:29:49.021 --> 01:29:49.854
<v Speaker 10>it and he was on probation for a auto </v>
<v Speaker 10>theft and they saw him on television in </v>

1679
01:29:55.411 --> 01:29:57.960
<v Speaker 10>California with the coal and immediately</v>
<v Speaker 10>went and arrested him.</v>

1680
01:29:58.840 --> 01:29:59.840
<v Speaker 10>That's where it fell through.</v>

1681
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:02.963
<v Speaker 10>So we worked fulltime,</v>
<v Speaker 10>still pay for everything and take care </v>

1682
01:30:05.581 --> 01:30:07.260
<v Speaker 10>of the group affairs all the other </v>
<v Speaker 10>times.</v>

1683
01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.670
<v Speaker 10>So no hobbies?</v>
<v Speaker 10>No.</v>

1684
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:11.580
<v Speaker 10>Any of the dutIes of providing </v>
<v Speaker 10>information,</v>

1685
01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.690
<v Speaker 10>just very focused on their beloved.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The how forthcoming they are though.</v>

1686
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:18.780
<v Speaker 10>They just did whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

1687
01:30:19.130 --> 01:30:21.000
<v Speaker 10>You got to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

1688
01:30:21.001 --> 01:30:22.710
<v Speaker 10>so.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And they got back to you pretty quick,</v>

1689
01:30:22.711 --> 01:30:23.544
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>What is this?</v>

1690
01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.100
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they're very faster responding.</v>

1691
01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:30.720
<v Speaker 10>So I found that when they w before </v>
<v Speaker 10>everyone went on the spaceship,</v>

1692
01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:31.883
<v Speaker 10>they,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the way they made money was actually a </v>

1693
01:30:33.301 --> 01:30:34.134
<v Speaker 10>lot of them were programmers and so this</v>
<v Speaker 10>was their old website called higher </v>

1694
01:30:37.801 --> 01:30:42.000
<v Speaker 10>source that they would have a use to get</v>
<v Speaker 10>programming jobs.</v>

1695
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:45.810
<v Speaker 10>And This is on the way back machine in </v>
<v Speaker 10>1997.</v>

1696
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:46.703
<v Speaker 10>I don't think it's there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So I just looked at what type of </v>

1697
01:30:48.691 --> 01:30:49.524
<v Speaker 10>websites they designed.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And if you go on their website design </v>

1698
01:30:51.751 --> 01:30:53.820
<v Speaker 10>tab,</v>
<v Speaker 10>here's the list of stuff they've done.</v>

1699
01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:57.930
<v Speaker 10>I clicked on one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 10>This is prima donna.</v>

1700
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:59.783
<v Speaker 10>They designed this website for a </v>
<v Speaker 10>unauthorized madonna cd was not a thing </v>

1701
01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:09.120
<v Speaker 10>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's madonna,</v>

1702
01:31:09.121 --> 01:31:09.954
<v Speaker 10>but it's like a bootleg and someone </v>
<v Speaker 10>hired them to sell this bootleg cd and </v>

1703
01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:17.940
<v Speaker 10>this pretty awesome website here.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So that's how they got their money.</v>

1704
01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:19.163
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's interesting looking at all these </v>

1705
01:31:20.191 --> 01:31:21.024
<v Speaker 10>old websites.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm wondering sitting on like a small </v>

1706
01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:27.760
<v Speaker 10>fortune from these madonna bootlegs.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm sure it was a big business and still</v>

1707
01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:30.600
<v Speaker 10>working a job.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Somebody's got to bay hosting bill.</v>

1708
01:31:31.330 --> 01:31:32.910
<v Speaker 10>They are working day jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

1709
01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:37.170
<v Speaker 10>So I read about the website design.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Were you one of the designers?</v>

1710
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:40.680
<v Speaker 10>Have you ever considered updating the </v>
<v Speaker 10>website to make it a little more modern?</v>

1711
01:31:40.681 --> 01:31:45.681
<v Speaker 10>I could give you an offer code with </v>
<v Speaker 10>squarespace and uh,</v>

1712
01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:48.323
<v Speaker 10>they weren't on the design team,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so they aren't still designing right </v>

1713
01:31:50.641 --> 01:31:50.880
<v Speaker 10>now.</v>

1714
01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.680
<v Speaker 10>So I know they said no,</v>
<v Speaker 10>thank you.</v>

1715
01:31:52.681 --> 01:31:55.860
<v Speaker 10>The website is to remain as it was in </v>
<v Speaker 10>march 97.</v>

1716
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:59.140
<v Speaker 10>Really promoting our sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I've wanted to throw that in.</v>

1717
01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:04.180
<v Speaker 10>I looked like they could use it if I </v>
<v Speaker 10>wAnted to reach the next level.</v>

1718
01:32:04.181 --> 01:32:07.660
<v Speaker 10>What are the main stePs I should take?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Predators destroying the power cable.</v>

1719
01:32:07.661 --> 01:32:08.494
<v Speaker 10>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I read that the next levels and actual </v>

1720
01:32:13.121 --> 01:32:13.954
<v Speaker 10>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Is there an actual hell to like must've </v>

1721
01:32:16.151 --> 01:32:18.790
<v Speaker 10>far in the outer rim.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's where a,</v>

1722
01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:23.680
<v Speaker 10>is that a reference?</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm not getting cut off mannequins arms,</v>

<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the next levels across universe.</v>

1724
01:32:27.371 --> 01:32:29.620
<v Speaker 10>There are no steps that can be taken in </v>
<v Speaker 10>this era.</v>

1725
01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.780
<v Speaker 10>So if you want to go now you're kind of </v>

<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

<v Speaker 10>group at the members were weak minded,</v>
<v Speaker 10>gullible,</v>

1735
01:33:00.971 --> 01:33:03.430
<v Speaker 10>and brainwashed.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Just the opposite is true.</v>

1736
01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:05.043
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I read that the group purchased alien </v>

1737
01:33:07.211 --> 01:33:10.750

<v Speaker 10>insurance provider prior to march.</v>

1739
01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:15.880

<v Speaker 10>This is like a rumor floating around and</v>

1740
01:33:15.881 --> 01:33:19.300
<v Speaker 10>it's on their wikipedia that they bought</v>
<v Speaker 10>alien abduction insurance.</v>

1741
01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:21.530
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's actually a company in,</v>

1742
01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:26.640
<v Speaker 10>in the best business ever to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 10>How much does it cost for alien?</v>

1743
01:33:26.981 --> 01:33:29.560
<v Speaker 10>And there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Anyone listening right now,</v>

<v Speaker 10>parents email me,</v>

1745
01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:33.513

<v Speaker 10>There's a company in the uk and geico </v>

1746
01:33:35.651 --> 01:33:39.730
<v Speaker 10>has a report on it that they've sold </v>
<v Speaker 10>over 30,000</v>

1747
01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:43.540
<v Speaker 10>insurance policies that is the best.</v>

1748
01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:48.490
<v Speaker 10>They said that they looked into it but </v>
<v Speaker 10>didn't buy it.</v>

1749
01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:49.353
<v Speaker 10>The internet turned a humorous inquiry </v>
<v Speaker 10>by us into a weird insurance event that </v>

1750
01:33:52.271 --> 01:33:54.400
<v Speaker 10>never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It was blown way out of proportion.</v>

1751
01:33:55.090 --> 01:33:58.360
<v Speaker 10>So they just goofed.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So this is,</v>

1752
01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:00.570
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I.</v>

1753
01:34:00.610 --> 01:34:02.890
<v Speaker 10>This is pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in a short way.</v>

1754
01:34:02.891 --> 01:34:03.724
<v Speaker 10>I asked if lil uzi vert could help carry</v>
<v Speaker 10>the torch and spread the word if he's </v>

1755
01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:11.080
<v Speaker 10>open to learning with this new movement.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He mentioned or does he not have what it</v>

1756
01:34:11.081 --> 01:34:12.610
<v Speaker 10>takes?</v>
<v Speaker 10>They go,</v>

1757
01:34:12.611 --> 01:34:16.180
<v Speaker 10>lil uzi vert would have to make a </v>
<v Speaker 10>dramatic change in his grasp of what the</v>

1758
01:34:16.181 --> 01:34:17.014
<v Speaker 10>next level is really like.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It would fizzle so they don't trust him </v>

1759
01:34:20.231 --> 01:34:23.620
<v Speaker 10>to carry on the legacy at a concert </v>
<v Speaker 10>recently,</v>

1760
01:34:23.621 --> 01:34:26.590
<v Speaker 10>this freaked everyone out where he said,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you guys are basically old friend.</v>

1761
01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:28.390
<v Speaker 10>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We feel like you're like one.</v>

1762
01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:33.340
<v Speaker 10>I feel like ian's going to show up </v>
<v Speaker 10>covered in a blanket with some nike's on</v>

1763
01:34:33.341 --> 01:34:34.174
<v Speaker 10>and a couple of weeks after,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know if I'm going to stop </v>

1764
01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:40.060
<v Speaker 10>talking to suck then I know I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm concerned.</v>

1765
01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:43.570
<v Speaker 10>I've started to rethink some things.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I may need to get some insurance.</v>

1766
01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:47.230
<v Speaker 10>I got you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but were you at a concert recently?</v>

1767
01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.800
<v Speaker 10>Uzi vert kind of freaked out his fans </v>
<v Speaker 10>because he said you,</v>

1768
01:34:50.801 --> 01:34:52.650
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you all have entered the rapture.</v>

1769
01:34:52.690 --> 01:34:54.730
<v Speaker 10>No one's flying up to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Obviously.</v>

1770
01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:57.100
<v Speaker 10>All of you are going to hell ride with </v>
<v Speaker 10>me.</v>

1771
01:34:57.470 --> 01:35:00.170
<v Speaker 10>You're already here.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So sorry you can't get out.</v>

<v Speaker 10>It's over.</v>

1773
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:04.520
<v Speaker 10>You heard the songs a million times.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You didn't even know.</v>

1774
01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:08.540
<v Speaker 10>So he's saying that his songs are like a</v>
<v Speaker 10>gateway to getting people to go to hell.</v>

1775
01:35:08.630 --> 01:35:10.970
<v Speaker 10>That's pretty bow thing to say to your </v>
<v Speaker 10>fans.</v>

1776
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:12.343
<v Speaker 10>And that was just like what?</v>
<v Speaker 10>His fans got kind of freaked out by </v>

1777
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:17.020
<v Speaker 10>expecting like the ground to like open </v>
<v Speaker 10>up from that minute.</v>

1778

<v Speaker 10>Everything he talkS about has nothing to</v>
