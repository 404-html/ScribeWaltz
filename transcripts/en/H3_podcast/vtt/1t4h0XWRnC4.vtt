11
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:42.211

<v Speaker 2>she is having a,</v>

12
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.270
<v Speaker 2>how do I say this without getting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble with youtube where a,</v>

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.133
<v Speaker 2>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his Janet Ohs is going into a female </v>

14
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 2>genitals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have speculated that this tape,</v>

15
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.080
<v Speaker 2>that it records his gentleman was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>into another person's gender roles.</v>

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.990
<v Speaker 2>That's an underage girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no evidence of that at all.</v>

22
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Why is it still called a tape?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really a tape.</v>

23
00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

<v Speaker 2>enough about Ila.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get to the one person in the world</v>

47
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.540
<v Speaker 2>who turns me on even more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg Paul now.</v>

48
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's start from the top because this</v>

49
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:30.734
<v Speaker 2>is a whole story that's kind of develop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to explain to you guys from </v>

50
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 2>the top what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

51
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

52
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 2>I think the first thing that happened in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

53
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong on anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think I've got my facts straight,</v>

54
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.050
<v Speaker 2>is that Logan Paul's channel was hacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

55
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.330
<v Speaker 2>And the attacker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 2>uploaded a basically a fake iphone </v>
<v Speaker 2>giveaway,</v>

57
00:02:55.591 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 2>which is honestly not that much of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>departure from his usual content.</v>

58
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>So I'm surprised anyone even noticed </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they took it down really fast.</v>

59
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.913
<v Speaker 2>Click the link in the description to </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim your free iphone x giving away </v>

60
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 2>1500.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I iphones.</v>

61
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.883
<v Speaker 2>Apparently people were clicking this </v>
<v Speaker 2>link and just getting like straight up </v>

62
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 2>key loggers and viruses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is great.</v>

63
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.423
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the best stuff on the Internet has </v>

64
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:20.254
<v Speaker 2>to offer.</v>

65
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.180
<v Speaker 2>So that got taken down pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

66
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.143
<v Speaker 2>on Sunday the hackers released jake </v>
<v Speaker 2>pauls calendar via their twitter pages </v>

67
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 2>since been banned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It included the address and contact info</v>

68
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 2>for many celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Justin Bieber.</v>

69
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Yikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was thought?</v>

70
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 2>This is a great twist thought to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ethan me,</v>

71
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's me.</v>

72
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Jake Paul was on our podcast,</v>

73
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.843
<v Speaker 2>he saved a dance number because he had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre show call with Dan and he saved it </v>

74
00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:58.114
<v Speaker 2>as h three h three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Dan's phone number was leaked over a </v>

75
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 2>blowing up with a phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was fun.</v>

76
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about that then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

77
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.030
<v Speaker 2>it was a Sunday afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

81
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ignored it.</v>

82
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 2>What kind of maniac answers don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers in 2018.</v>

94
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:42.274

<v Speaker 2>You're just calling the call.</v>

100
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.173
<v Speaker 2>I'll say when I'm on my phone number got</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaked previously when we got hacked </v>

101
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 2>dealer and they posted our phone number </v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter and we were,</v>

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Fun Ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually it,</v>

105
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.523
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't access my phone cause there </v>

106
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 2>was just incoming calls nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't like swipe it open.</v>

107
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.313
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was getting tons of text messages </v>

108
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think I actually ever told </v>
<v Speaker 2>you this,</v>

109
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.683
<v Speaker 2>but somebody sent me,</v>

110
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:28.654
<v Speaker 2>message cause I was generally not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of them was a dick pic and I </v>

111
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 2>have to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did feel violated.</v>

112
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.673
<v Speaker 2>And in that moment I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a moment of like empathy and </v>

113
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 2>sympathy for all the females out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting unsolicited dick pics because it</v>

114
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 2>felt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it felt very,</v>

115
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 2>I felt very violated that I saw this </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

116
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 2>He was a fat man with the tiny small </v>
<v Speaker 2>penis.</v>

117
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.860
<v Speaker 2>It looked almost like my own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm being honest,</v>

118
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:53.694
<v Speaker 2>a tiny little penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pubes were much longer than the </v>

119
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:57.140
<v Speaker 2>penis itself and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

120
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Is that a picture I took?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

121
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.890
<v Speaker 2>it was someone sending me their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

122
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.853
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you would think it was his </v>

123
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 2>fixture and not something off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet?</v>

124
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.971
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was definitely,</v>

125
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 2>dude just snapped his junk and send it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

126
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a fat chubby little penis.</v>

127
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.243
<v Speaker 2>I was me to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to tell you that for a </v>

128
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to take back.</v>

129
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Me Too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us,</v>

130
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 2>for me meat anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently me third,</v>

131
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 2>apparently the hacker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

132
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:27.944
<v Speaker 2>this kind of perplexes me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hacker gotten to Jake Logan and </v>

133
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 2>their father's account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all three.</v>

134
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these guys are big shots.</v>

135
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 2>They had run big companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How first of all,</v>

136
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 2>is there security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not tighter run third of all,</v>

137
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 2>how do you get into all three of them at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time?</v>

138
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:46.874
<v Speaker 2>What I was wondering is are they still </v>
<v Speaker 2>all on the same family plan at Verizon </v>

139
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 2>or some shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

140
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you explain that they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>all three of their account?</v>

141
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

142
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 2>regardless of how it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

143
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.490
<v Speaker 2>it could only happen to these geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

144
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.583
<v Speaker 2>apparently just so in Jake's dms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was all kinds of stuff of him </v>

145
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:14.400
<v Speaker 2>flirting with girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

146
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 2>they teased all kinds of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't show anything.</v>

147
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:18.704
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But definitely the most fucked up thing </v>

148
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:24.731
<v Speaker 2>to come out of it by far was the Greg </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul sex tape.</v>

149
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Greg Paul being the father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

150
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 2>this guy's a piece of work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

151
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.783
<v Speaker 2>Greg Paul's the guy who has notoriously </v>
<v Speaker 2>made out with little girls and one of </v>

152
00:07:36.401 --> 00:07:37.234
<v Speaker 2>Jake's videos kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there might have been and he </v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean emphasize a lot of foreign in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

179
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the most things I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen in my life.</v>

180
00:08:57.091 --> 00:08:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is horrible.</v>

181
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Mba was horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly horrific.</v>

182
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Let me play you a little soundbite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lovely thing was that it was just on</v>

183
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:04.584
<v Speaker 2>twitter and like I just saw people </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it going up the thread of </v>

184
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:15.040
<v Speaker 2>a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just they're on twitter and yeah,</v>

185
00:09:15.041 --> 00:09:20.041
<v Speaker 2>that's how I saw it first till.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I saw what I saw was like him,</v>

186
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 2>like fingering her.</v>

187
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.633
<v Speaker 2>But then I do my research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched the whole thing on one of </v>

188
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:28.194
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

189
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>websites and it is old graphic brothers.</v>

190
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:36.480
<v Speaker 2>The one scene where he's slapping her </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his Dick,</v>

191
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to use a PC words here because</v>

192
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 2>we are family friendly show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He uses his a carrot.</v>

193
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he puts his care and her soil.</v>

194
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.513
<v Speaker 2>But what happens is he's slapping her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slapping her peace with this carrot and </v>

195
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 2>she starts to water his carrot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

196
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 2>she pees on his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God,</v>

197
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 2>she pees on his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the sound that it makes this</v>

198
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 2>sound from the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She pees on his dick.</v>

199
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's slapping her and she's paying on</v>

200
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:12.420
<v Speaker 2>his deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think,</v>

201
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fmr people would love this sound.</v>

202
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.250
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Greg Faull sex dig a smrs </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested.</v>

203
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Let me try to experience stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>space tomorrow.</v>

204
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely getting the tone alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still in a tingle and my forehead.</v>

205
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this video is so graphic.</v>

206
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

207
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing identifying the man or,</v>

208
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.880
<v Speaker 2>or the female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my first thought was that,</v>

209
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.620
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be anyone.</v>

210
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Let's look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

211
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I want to see is this actually Greg </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul?</v>

212
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm not willing to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm very willing to believe it,</v>

213
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:01.610
<v Speaker 2>but I just want to know what's my hunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here we've got some evidence here.</v>

214
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me see here.</v>

215
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he ready to come again.</v>

216
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Definitely sounds like a hit me with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hemi with that Zach could be,</v>

217
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.083
<v Speaker 2>but I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we do a little CSI photo matching </v>

218
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:28.890
<v Speaker 2>and this is fairly conclusive in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>

219
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it's hard to tell.</v>

220
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

221
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.043
<v Speaker 2>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from his instagram has dog sleeping on </v>

222
00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:37.584
<v Speaker 2>his bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what we're paying our attention to </v>

223
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:43.110
<v Speaker 2>is this floral kind of pattern here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the woodwork.</v>

224
00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:44.630
<v Speaker 2>And you can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's,</v>

225
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I know this doesn't look that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

226
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you,</v>

227
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I've watched the videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's better screenshots,</v>

228
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.653
<v Speaker 2>but it definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it matches it's the same ad board and </v>

229
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:54.923
<v Speaker 2>when it's in motion in the video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot more evidence that it's the same </v>

230
00:11:58.151 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely the same.</v>

231
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.650
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

232
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.420
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had more evidence than that.</v>

233
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:05.550
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

234
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Well let's leave the evidence I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

235
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:10.400
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me say this.</v>

236
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.080
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely the same headboard</v>

237
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 2>and European and my humble alleged </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>

238
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:22.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not even an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an alleged that your opinion sir,</v>

239
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.480
<v Speaker 2>allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

240
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:28.790
<v Speaker 2>under age though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

241
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.220
<v Speaker 2>who could ever say that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous?</v>

242
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

243
00:12:32.421 --> 00:12:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to put out the guys having </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex with underage girls.</v>

244
00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:35.984
<v Speaker 2>I will believe him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was having what I would it be a </v>

245
00:12:38.001 --> 00:12:42.320
<v Speaker 2>stretch of my imagination to think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>greg was having sex on average girls?</v>

246
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not because of him kissing.</v>

247
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.490
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

248
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.790
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what she had happened.</v>

249
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

250
00:12:54.111 --> 00:12:56.450
<v Speaker 2>what if he was what it's from some </v>
<v Speaker 2>hackers.</v>

251
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

252
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.570
<v Speaker 2>the first thought I had was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

253
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.920
<v Speaker 2>you can't really use that as evidence in</v>
<v Speaker 2>court because it's illegally obtained.</v>

254
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well regardless,</v>

255
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.810
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence to disclose under </v>
<v Speaker 2>age at all.</v>

256
00:13:08.811 --> 00:13:09.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

257
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to insinuate that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically though,</v>

258
00:13:13.161 --> 00:13:13.994
<v Speaker 2>Greg has acknowledged that the hack has </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in this instagram video in </v>

<v Speaker 2>I thought that was kind of interesting.</v>

303

310
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought it was funny thing.</v>

311
00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.490
<v Speaker 2>He's being bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor guy</v>

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.240
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

313
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.183
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why the guy does it because</v>
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't get any real recognition for </v>

314
00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:42.174
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's not really messing up my life that </v>

315
00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:47.550
<v Speaker 6>bad cause my life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just not that important.</v>

316
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.120
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've learned a lot from,</v>

317
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.830
<v Speaker 6>I learned about some ways to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 6>hacking and all this stuff.</v>

318
00:15:52.831 --> 00:15:53.670
<v Speaker 6>But Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're out there,</v>

319
00:15:53.671 --> 00:15:56.130
<v Speaker 6>I want you to reach out to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The guy still has my aol</v>

320

<v Speaker 2>password.</v>

321
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.013
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot about security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg Paul rules still has his aol </v>

322
00:16:07.141 --> 00:16:07.791
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

328
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I think this was probably an elaborate </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruse to,</v>

329

<v Speaker 2>to get them,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Paul probably still has aol dial up on </v>

<v Speaker 2>dial up.</v>

334
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Like all these old people that never </v>
<v Speaker 2>upgrade their internet.</v>

<v Speaker 6>set in a positive way and probably make </v>

<v Speaker 2>You might say my heart scotches from one</v>

358
00:17:57.391 --> 00:18:02.391
<v Speaker 2>might say that and I really hope the </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl was not under age for his sake.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so we can wrap it up from here.</v>

366
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Apparently the hacker said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what is the hacker said that they have </v>

<v Speaker 2>fought it to the FBI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

369
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 2>who knows what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden they have a conscious,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there you go.</v>

371

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

00:18:55.471 --> 00:18:58.800

<v Speaker 2>He's apparently yes.</v>

374
00:18:58.801 --> 00:18:59.634
<v Speaker 2>And it's Nick Crumpton left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg is taken over the mantle and he is </v>

375
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:07.650
<v Speaker 2>a mashing dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need me to play that again?</v>

376
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

377
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 2>moving on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Post Malone is cursed.</v>

378
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.663
<v Speaker 2>You guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may have heard the recent reports </v>

379
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:18.264
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all y'all heard about how his </v>

380
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:22.270
<v Speaker 2>plane took off and the wheel blew up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>takeoff.</v>

381
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.530
<v Speaker 2>They had to emergency land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God post Malone was okay.</v>

382
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:26.783
<v Speaker 2>Next up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next couple of days he's in a car </v>

383
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:31.320
<v Speaker 2>crash or someone driving a quarter </v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollar Rolls Royce,</v>

384
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.670
<v Speaker 2>a car crash thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

385
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 2>he's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Blessed.</v>

386
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:34.824
<v Speaker 2>The suite are of that man and then an </v>
<v Speaker 2>armed robbery took place at his old </v>

387
00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:41.210
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That place we've been to I,</v>

388
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.650
<v Speaker 2>if it's the place I'm thinking of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think it has to be,</v>

389
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.570
<v Speaker 2>we've been there a lot of times.</v>

390
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:46.403
<v Speaker 2>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Armed robbers show up at the House </v>

391
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.200
<v Speaker 2>asking more post Malone is terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm so glad that post wasn't there.</v>

392
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:55.584
<v Speaker 2>He had since moved and the tenants that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were living there got stood up at </v>

393
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.730
<v Speaker 2>gunpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stall like 20,000</v>

394
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.950
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some things,</v>

395
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.050
<v Speaker 2>jewelry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

396
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.943
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad that Austin was in there </v>

397
00:20:09.181 --> 00:20:11.550
<v Speaker 2>because he's a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't call nine one,</v>

398
00:20:11.551 --> 00:20:13.860
<v Speaker 2>one kinda guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

399
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.240
<v Speaker 2>That would have been some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some gunfire.</v>

400
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I have a bad feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at any rate,</v>

401
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.840
<v Speaker 2>what is going on with Post Malone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

402
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 2>we think we have the answer guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think we've figured it out.</v>

403
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.710
<v Speaker 2>And of course it's TMZ who was put the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces together.</v>

404
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.823
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>posting them messing with evil spirits </v>

405
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:39.240
<v Speaker 2>on video now curse plane and car makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

406
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.070
<v Speaker 2>It all makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

407
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.920
<v Speaker 2>this Guy Zach from ghost hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys are so funny.</v>

408
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.810
<v Speaker 2>You know how I feel about goes something</v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern loves it though.</v>

409
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.840
<v Speaker 2>So apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

410
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.260
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

411
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Zach tells us the closing encounter went</v>
<v Speaker 2>down in June and is haunted museum.</v>

412
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.030
<v Speaker 2>The object is called the Dubuque Dbu </v>
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>

413
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.893
<v Speaker 2>Dbu Is Yiddish for malicious spirit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the box inspired the horror flipped </v>

414
00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really yiddish.</v>

415
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.190
<v Speaker 2>So they're saying that Jews are behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

416
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's another Jewish conspiracy.</v>

417
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:22.330
<v Speaker 2>So explain what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this box,</v>

418
00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 2>this Guy Zach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ghost hunter.</v>

419
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.003
<v Speaker 2>It's apparently the most cursed item in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world because they're Jewish ghosts </v>

420
00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:31.420
<v Speaker 2>and they got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a chip on their shoulder.</v>

421
00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's videos for this is it dude?</v>

422
00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:35.350

<v Speaker 2>Let me fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck dude you got?</v>

424
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.840
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>

425
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:41.703
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

426
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 2>of all the cursed objects in the world,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're the most gnarly.</v>

430
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.093
<v Speaker 2>The Jewish goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the ones you absolutely do not want </v>

<v Speaker 2>That's kind of it up.</v>

432
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.560
<v Speaker 2>So here's the video that explains </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's been going on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the case itself as the story as opposed </v>

<v Speaker 2>But that's where postmen fucked up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but curse was transferred to them.</v>

470
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.353
<v Speaker 2>when he opens the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's like something moving </v>

471
00:23:44.431 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 2>out of the lefty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll play by play,</v>

472
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:49.520

<v Speaker 2>But first,</v>

473
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:52.760
<v Speaker 2>let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So often it's freaking out.</v>

474
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:53.663
<v Speaker 2>He's got a beer in hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to talk Zach and to getting </v>

475
00:23:55.611 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hyper ventilate,</v>

476
00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:58.250
<v Speaker 2>he's breathing heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's grabbing him.</v>

477
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.020
<v Speaker 2>He's saying they run out of the room now</v>

478
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:07.373
<v Speaker 2>post malone being the sweet guy he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took the curse from Zack and these </v>

479
00:24:12.991 --> 00:24:13.800
<v Speaker 2>old yiddish.</v>

481
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.750
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because these yiddish ghosts,</v>

482
00:24:18.751 --> 00:24:21.840
<v Speaker 2>they need a good Jewish boy to come talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense into them.</v>

483
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I think I can channel maybe these </v>
<v Speaker 2>yiddish ghosts and lift the curtain.</v>

484
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.490

633
00:32:15.801 --> 00:32:17.770
<v Speaker 2>home security works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to ring what it,</v>

634
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.280
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it started with the doorbell.</v>

635
00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.293
<v Speaker 2>You clicked the doorbell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes the noise inside of like a </v>

636
00:32:21.741 --> 00:32:24.500
<v Speaker 2>normal Doba but it's also got a camera </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a microphone.</v>

640
00:32:32.301 --> 00:32:33.134

<v Speaker 2>but it zaps the recording up to the </v>

641
00:32:35.601 --> 00:32:36.434
<v Speaker 2>cloud and saves it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that they're not getting </v>

<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can talk to them.</v>

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Welcome back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nutty weather reporters.</v>

731
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.800
<v Speaker 2>This has been a phenomenon that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

732
00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these reporters,</v>

733
00:37:11.911 --> 00:37:12.744
<v Speaker 2>they send them out and to hurricanes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>treacherous weather crap out crack open </v>

734
00:37:17.821 --> 00:37:22.821
<v Speaker 2>here is 30 pounds and they make these </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor sons of bitches basically brave,</v>

735
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.713
<v Speaker 2>dangerous wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes the ones they're not that </v>

736
00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:32.400
<v Speaker 2>dangerous so they have to hype up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger themselves.</v>

737
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.860
<v Speaker 2>We've got a little of each got a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>off but what was the name of this recent</v>

738
00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:38.970
<v Speaker 2>hurricane?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florence.</v>

739
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:42.930
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>

740
00:37:42.931 --> 00:37:45.700
<v Speaker 2>you guys may have heard there was one </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular gentlemen,</v>

741
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.133
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was called out all over the </v>

742
00:37:48.391 --> 00:37:53.391
<v Speaker 2>Internet for his uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurricane Florence meme and this guy was</v>

743
00:37:54.361 --> 00:37:59.361
<v Speaker 2>out in the weather channel and it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this classic story of acting like the</v>

744
00:37:59.581 --> 00:38:00.414
<v Speaker 2>weather's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then somebody walking through the </v>

745
00:38:02.131 --> 00:38:04.470
<v Speaker 2>back wall here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you watch.</v>

746
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:12.900
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

747
00:38:12.901 --> 00:38:13.734
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth noting is I'm leaning in North </v>

748
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Carolina right away from the where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wind is blowing.</v>

749
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:25.103
<v Speaker 2>Like that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have said that maybe he's </v>

750
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:31.200
<v Speaker 2>covering the microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't really make sense to me</v>

751
00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:32.443
<v Speaker 2>cause you can see as it goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's clearly not covering the </v>

752
00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.110
<v Speaker 2>microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just whipping through here.</v>

753
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.120
<v Speaker 2>More heavy rain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they have that.</v>

754
00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to brace some stuff though.</v>

755
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.370
<v Speaker 2>That is a pretty healthy cusp right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

756
00:38:43.371 --> 00:38:44.204
<v Speaker 2>When you have fun anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in the beginning you can see a </v>

757
00:38:46.221 --> 00:38:49.610
<v Speaker 2>couple of dudes just strolling as casual</v>
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>

758
00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.113
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

759
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:54.590
<v Speaker 2>And Wilmington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina,</v>

760
00:38:54.591 --> 00:38:57.500
<v Speaker 2>right at the intracoastal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're in one of these bands.</v>

761
00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:58.403
<v Speaker 2>This is just literally scrolling by and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Patchouli as possibly do I love </v>

762
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:10.540
<v Speaker 2>sneakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's truly no problem balancing.</v>

763
00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.390
<v Speaker 2>We're 60 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

764
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.183
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would I thought that only on </v>

765
00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:19.204
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought people exaggerate and right </v>

766
00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:21.973
<v Speaker 2>quick money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these are like real professional </v>

767
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:28.720
<v Speaker 2>weathermen is it like scientists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

768
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:29.554
<v Speaker 2>You set up these atmospheres and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody will be reduced to a </v>

769
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:38.190
<v Speaker 2>clickbaiting Nice Smr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spaghetti con of Jesus Christ.</v>

770
00:39:43.391 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 2>I click on it starts again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

771
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:48.700
<v Speaker 2>people got really upset by this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

772
00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.860
<v Speaker 2>overdramatizing of how bad it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it just funny.</v>

773
00:39:53.861 --> 00:39:54.694
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

774
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.270
<v Speaker 2>you're out there bracing yourself the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong way.</v>

775
00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.043
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

776
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.010
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other excuse I heard,</v>

777
00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:06.380
<v Speaker 2>is there anything to this that it's that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

778
00:40:06.381 --> 00:40:07.430
<v Speaker 2>well he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

779
00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.590
<v Speaker 2>he was standing on grass is why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

780
00:40:09.591 --> 00:40:10.910
<v Speaker 2>I've got that from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

781
00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I'll read that later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That man,</v>

782
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.810
<v Speaker 2>while I have a statement from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weather report,</v>

783
00:40:14.811 --> 00:40:18.080
<v Speaker 2>they defend him against the claims and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

784
00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got it all laid out.</v>

785
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:21.343
<v Speaker 2>I want to enjoy some more footage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy bracing against the </v>

786
00:40:23.211 --> 00:40:25.600
<v Speaker 2>treacherous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether raw cane and we're getting gusts</v>

787
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:27.523
<v Speaker 2>pushing God still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it goes without saying the </v>

788
00:40:31.541 --> 00:40:32.374
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes we're misleading with </v>

789
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:36.910
<v Speaker 2>hurricanes where the wind is whipping </v>
<v Speaker 2>through here.</v>

00:40:36.911 --> 00:40:39.250
<v Speaker 2>More heavy guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 miles per hour.</v>

<v Speaker 2>have to lower your center.</v>

<v Speaker 2>for the whole year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put together these insane three d </v>

818
00:41:58.851 --> 00:42:03.851
<v Speaker 2>renders where these reporters stand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a severe with a massive crazy green</v>

819
00:42:05.571 --> 00:42:10.540
<v Speaker 2>screen and they show you virtually like </v>
<v Speaker 2>where are the water heights are,</v>

820
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.473
<v Speaker 2>will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just so over the fucking top </v>

821
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:16.400
<v Speaker 2>for what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

822
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:17.234
<v Speaker 2>It's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're all just so jacked about </v>

823
00:42:19.761 --> 00:42:20.594
<v Speaker 2>these hurt hurricanes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here let me show you born to bring </v>

824
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:25.380
<v Speaker 2>kind of crack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of crap.</v>

825
00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.153
<v Speaker 2>Look at this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That certainly is enough to knock you </v>

826
00:42:29.201 --> 00:42:30.034
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat.</v>

827
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.423
<v Speaker 2>Definitely stole cars out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even carry cars away as certainly flood </v>

828
00:42:35.721 --> 00:42:36.554
<v Speaker 2>many of the lower levels of structures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know Florence is also going to </v>

829
00:42:38.691 --> 00:42:42.590
<v Speaker 2>bring water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's water.</v>

830
00:42:42.591 --> 00:42:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

831
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.960
<v Speaker 2>six feet of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that.</v>

832
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Imagine the add on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

833
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.733
<v Speaker 2>the technology of the weatherman that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would otherwise be and also tommy cause </v>

834
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.470
<v Speaker 2>higher and where else can we use this </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology?</v>

835
00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes even higher.</v>

836
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said it perfectly reminds me of like</v>

837
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:07.320
<v Speaker 2>the facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ducker cruise through Puerto Rico,</v>

838
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.200
<v Speaker 2>the Puerto Rico life's trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish in the water.</v>

839
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck is that realistic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cover up one story.</v>

840
00:43:15.471 --> 00:43:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Buildings and structures and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>details.</v>

841
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Mather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that's certainly pose a risk to</v>

842
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:22.750
<v Speaker 2>many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are very few places so he wouldn't</v>

843
00:43:22.751 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 2>be that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that is like,</v>

844
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:26.730
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's underwater.</v>

845
00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:27.750
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even tell his ass.</v>

846
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wall.</v>

847
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.353
<v Speaker 2>Follow the advice of your local </v>
<v Speaker 2>officials and he viewed that black </v>

848
00:43:39.391 --> 00:43:40.224
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the garbage bag corpse and I bet </v>

849
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:45.070
<v Speaker 2>that's selling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

850
00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:45.903
<v Speaker 2>the intention is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heed the advice and get the hell out of </v>

851
00:43:47.951 --> 00:43:49.660
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get washed away.</v>

852
00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:52.090
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

853
00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Don't braved the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

854
00:43:53.281 --> 00:43:54.370
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find ironic.</v>

855
00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.730
<v Speaker 2>All of these weather reporters are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not braved the storm.</v>

856
00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Everybody evacuated and meanwhile I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do right.</v>

857
00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:01.304
<v Speaker 2>No one's blown away and listened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to justify staying because </v>

858
00:44:07.451 --> 00:44:08.284
<v Speaker 2>it's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By over reacting and acting like till </v>

859
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.000
<v Speaker 2>like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's happening.</v>

860
00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:18.270
<v Speaker 2>There's another clip of a girl I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love these clubs.</v>

861
00:44:18.271 --> 00:44:19.740
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>

862
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Loved their enthusiasm for hurricanes.</v>

863
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.670
<v Speaker 9>Florence is a large and extremely </v>
<v Speaker 9>destructive hurricane.</v>

864
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.563
<v Speaker 9>Storm surge is going to be potentially </v>
<v Speaker 9>life threatening for some areas along </v>

865
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:30.584
<v Speaker 9>the u s coastline and this morning we've</v>
<v Speaker 9>seen the water picking up over some of </v>

866
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:34.584
<v Speaker 9>the roadways.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let's go ahead and take a look at what </v>

867
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:36.654
<v Speaker 9>could be a reasonable worst case </v>
<v Speaker 9>scenario for areas along North Carolina </v>

868
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 9>all the way here from surf city to North</v>
<v Speaker 9>Topsail beach,</v>

869
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:43.134
<v Speaker 9>we could be talking about up to six feet</v>
<v Speaker 9>of storm surge and again impacts have </v>

870
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:49.740
<v Speaker 9>already begun today with the storm </v>
<v Speaker 9>approaching even inland.</v>

871
00:44:49.741 --> 00:44:51.600
<v Speaker 9>It's not just going to be a coastal </v>
<v Speaker 9>event here,</v>

872
00:44:51.601 --> 00:44:52.434
<v Speaker 9>areas along the river and that we can </v>
<v Speaker 9>show you what this could look like if </v>

873
00:44:56.131 --> 00:44:57.990
<v Speaker 9>you were to find yourself in this </v>
<v Speaker 9>scenario.</v>

874
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:01.710
<v Speaker 9>Once that water comes in three feet,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can see it on my shins,</v>

875
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.053
<v Speaker 9>my waist.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This could be enough to knock you off </v>

876
00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:05.514
<v Speaker 9>your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You can eat another guy at the far side </v>

877
00:45:08.191 --> 00:45:09.024
<v Speaker 9>of the roadway.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This is extremely dangerous to that six </v>

878
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:15.330
<v Speaker 9>foot range.</v>
<v Speaker 9>How high this water goes.</v>

879
00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.860
<v Speaker 9>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Wins pick everything.</v>

880
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:18.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>

881
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.720
<v Speaker 2>They got a little choreography with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet no powers</v>

882
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.673
<v Speaker 9>stand here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Even withstand the force of the water </v>

883
00:45:24.781 --> 00:45:25.790
<v Speaker 9>coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 9>No Shit.</v>

884
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 9>But anyway,</v>

885
00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

886
00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Love it very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course there was,</v>

887
00:45:34.661 --> 00:45:36.370
<v Speaker 2>of all things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

888
00:45:36.371 --> 00:45:37.204
<v Speaker 2>they probably blew up all their budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a production budget that they </v>

889
00:45:40.331 --> 00:45:41.164
<v Speaker 2>blow one week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next toy there point is going to be </v>

890
00:45:44.351 --> 00:45:46.930
<v Speaker 2>on like the cell phone camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

891
00:45:46.931 --> 00:45:48.130
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

892
00:45:48.131 --> 00:45:51.820
<v Speaker 2>they can't afford cameraman anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then of course there was,</v>

893
00:45:51.821 --> 00:45:55.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ludy interestingly,</v>

894
00:45:55.061 --> 00:45:59.020
<v Speaker 2>of all places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dollar store was alluded.</v>

895

<v Speaker 2>If you're gonna I mean a dollar store </v>
<v Speaker 2>looters [inaudible] dollar store </v>

<v Speaker 2>law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could something more valuable than a </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

902
00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's watch a video.</v>

903
00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:30.230
<v Speaker 2>This reporter is 13th and very brave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you getting there?</v>

904
00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Entering the cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

905
00:46:31.241 --> 00:46:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Kitchen towels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of kitchen towels,</v>

906
00:46:34.211 --> 00:46:35.060
<v Speaker 2>some juice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

907
00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.060
<v Speaker 2>some cheap oil.</v>

908
00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:41.170
<v Speaker 2>That's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

909
00:46:41.171 --> 00:46:42.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get there.</v>

910
00:46:42.251 --> 00:46:46.720
<v Speaker 2>You could steal a 10 pack of sporks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does park?</v>

911
00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.613
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fork spoon combination into one </v>

912
00:46:49.691 --> 00:46:50.830
<v Speaker 2>utensil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

913
00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:55.090
<v Speaker 2>there's some fancy sporks actually have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a knife on the side that's outside of,</v>

914
00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.590
<v Speaker 2>that's the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

915
00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:59.440
<v Speaker 2>you can't find that kind of quality at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dollar store though.</v>

916
00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:01.923
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is anyone else that sat at the dollar </v>

917
00:47:06.461 --> 00:47:09.910
<v Speaker 2>store and not everything costs a dollar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't even be,</v>

918
00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:15.180
<v Speaker 2>I think because you know it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset me because I know that you,</v>

919
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:17.643
<v Speaker 2>I would go shopping in those stores and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's what I want is like 15 $15 </v>

920
00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:23.800
<v Speaker 2>that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's too far.</v>

921
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:24.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a $15 item in the dollar </v>

922
00:47:26.381 --> 00:47:29.750
<v Speaker 2>store close up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm alluding is what I'm at.</v>

923
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm alluding your dollar store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand in this day and age is 2018</v>

924
00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:37.660
<v Speaker 2>we've had a flesh and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can kick it up to two or three bucks</v>

925
00:47:37.661 --> 00:47:38.494
<v Speaker 2>for a really premium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about a spork with a knife </v>

926
00:47:40.481 --> 00:47:41.314
<v Speaker 2>up the side.</v>

927
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 2>You can charge a premium for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

928
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:44.494
<v Speaker 2>I remember even in Israel we have both </v>
<v Speaker 2>stores and it's like a shotgun store </v>

929
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.983
<v Speaker 2>that's 25 cents by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then what I want would be 20 </v>

930
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:55.870
<v Speaker 2>shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh give me a fucking break.</v>

931
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah you make a scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do,</v>

932
00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:58.893
<v Speaker 2>do row stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know like what do you put on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>work order?</v>

1154
00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Just put it on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What other men budget?</v>

1155
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:19.990
<v Speaker 2>They got all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll get out of their special effects</v>

1156
00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:20.960
<v Speaker 2>budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1157
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:23.310
<v Speaker 2>deep water because they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1158
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:24.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to need a button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1159
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:26.203
<v Speaker 2>Now what this button does is it locks </v>
<v Speaker 2>the door from the outside so I can </v>

1160
00:59:31.071 --> 00:59:34.610
<v Speaker 2>really focus and get some work done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>

1161
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Well now it's for me to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus,</v>

1162
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.000
<v Speaker 2>but just hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody wanted to get out,</v>

1163
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.430
<v Speaker 2>they have to push this button under my </v>
<v Speaker 2>desk to get out.</v>

1164
00:59:43.431 --> 00:59:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Now that's just to make sure that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus all the way that I need to.</v>

1165

<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.460
<v Speaker 2>talk to me and it turns out he did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>install it.</v>

1174
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:26.020
<v Speaker 2>It was a mechanism that was a standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>feature in many of the older offices.</v>

1175
01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.530
<v Speaker 2>That was like the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're debunking that.</v>

1176
01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what was the story?</v>

1177
01:00:31.981 --> 01:00:33.390
<v Speaker 2>What did he get in trouble for them?</v>

1178
01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:34.880
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1179
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.550

<v Speaker 2>he raped somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1181
01:00:40.251 --> 01:00:41.084
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sexual misconduct whenever there's </v>

1182
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:44.923
<v Speaker 2>allegations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people were wondering about that if </v>

1183
01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:49.510
<v Speaker 2>he installed it personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1185
01:00:52.481 --> 01:00:55.060
<v Speaker 2>in the fifties yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just standard.</v>

1325
01:08:21.501 --> 01:08:26.501

<v Speaker 2>What else we got?</v>

1326
01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1327
01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:36.950
<v Speaker 2>some thing I've got the fat shaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>fashion revolve the drop.</v>

1328
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a company called revolve,</v>

1329
01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:43.700
<v Speaker 2>which is a fashion company that teamed </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with Lena Dunham.</v>

1330
01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.083
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what Lena Dunham and </v>

1331
01:08:45.861 --> 01:08:47.150
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she comedian,</v>

1332
01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.800
<v Speaker 2>I just hear a name all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1333
01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:52.640
<v Speaker 2>she's a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1334
01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:53.933
<v Speaker 2>at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she worked on a collaboration with this </v>

1335
01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.720
<v Speaker 2>company and it's a female empowerment </v>
<v Speaker 2>colab.</v>

1336
01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:09.650
<v Speaker 2>So the idea behind it was that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to make clothes that,</v>

1337
01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:13.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoted body positivity.</v>

1338
01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.153
<v Speaker 2>So with that in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me show you what the final product </v>

1339
01:09:18.711 --> 01:09:19.600
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1340
01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:22.500
<v Speaker 2>so here you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1341
01:09:22.501 --> 01:09:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't expand it.</v>

1342
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:27.040
<v Speaker 2>That fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it does what?</v>

1343
01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:30.120
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely his fault.</v>

1344
01:09:33.150 --> 01:09:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just zooming on the page.</v>

1345
01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Usually when you click it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just pops out.</v>

1346
01:09:38.730 --> 01:09:39.830
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1347
01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.150
<v Speaker 2>let me try refresh it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1348
01:09:42.151 --> 01:09:42.901
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

1349
01:09:42.901 --> 01:09:47.320
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dad Page can write.</v>

1350
01:09:47.730 --> 01:09:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Try right clicking it and view image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that.</v>

1351
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1352
01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:58.410
<v Speaker 2>here's a beautiful skinny model that </v>
<v Speaker 2>says two bony to be bombed.</v>

1353
01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:03.720
<v Speaker 2>So the idea was that they took quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurtful quotes,</v>

1354
01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:06.480
<v Speaker 2>and they used it as armor to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1355
01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:13.350
<v Speaker 2>your words don't hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So horrible result of modern feminism.</v>

1356
01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:14.920
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1357
01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Slut feminist nightmare to bind to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>bond.</v>

1358
01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:22.030
<v Speaker 2>If you translated a bomb onto her face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd have a better faith.</v>

1359
01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:26.140
<v Speaker 2>And of course here again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being fat is not beautiful.</v>

1360
01:10:26.141 --> 01:10:26.974
<v Speaker 2>It's an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that one is the worst </v>

1361
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:33.550
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] girl that imagine wearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1362
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:40.950
<v Speaker 2>So people look at this $170 being fat is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not bad if fall,</v>

1363
01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.830
<v Speaker 2>it's an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Oh,</v>

1364
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:46.810
<v Speaker 2>fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1365
01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:48.543
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they missed the mark so much what </v>

1366
01:10:52.451 --> 01:10:55.180
<v Speaker 2>happened here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly I guess they meant the heavy,</v>

1367
01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:57.090
<v Speaker 2>heavier size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1368
01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:58.173
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still a weird shirt if I'm being </v>

1369
01:11:01.241 --> 01:11:02.710
<v Speaker 2>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1370
01:11:02.711 --> 01:11:07.150
<v Speaker 2>But this combination or are small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1371
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:10.270
<v Speaker 2>You cannot tell that it's a quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1372
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:13.840
<v Speaker 2>But either way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beautiful fit model was just a,</v>

1373
01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.820
<v Speaker 2>so people got so upset and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants the Xing,</v>

1374
01:11:17.821 --> 01:11:19.770
<v Speaker 2>apologies and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1375
01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.580
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this image really just is what I love so</v>

1376
01:11:23.581 --> 01:11:26.460
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being fat is not beautiful.</v>

1377
01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:31.461
<v Speaker 2>It's an excuse I earned 70 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So thank you to Lena Dunham and um,</v>

1378

<v Speaker 2>talent that she has fake hair.</v>

1381
01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Now I guess this is a somewhat common </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing of,</v>

1382
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:05.630
<v Speaker 2>of females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess black females have a lot of them</v>

1383
01:12:05.631 --> 01:12:06.464
<v Speaker 2>have fake hair weave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We watch a whole documentary the Chris </v>

<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1385
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:15.720
<v Speaker 2>It was really interesting because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think he made it.</v>

1386
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Chris Rock.</v>

1387
01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.133
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't actually know this was a </v>

1388
01:12:20.481 --> 01:12:21.314
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of black women have fake hair </v>

1389
01:12:23.931 --> 01:12:26.420
<v Speaker 2>like from India.</v>

1390
01:12:26.421 --> 01:12:27.254
<v Speaker 2>they have like tiny little corn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corn rows and then they weave real hair </v>

1391
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:36.860
<v Speaker 2>of like straight or wavy hair and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have like really elaborate weaves.</v>

1392
01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Apparently you're not supposed to touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>a black woman's hair.</v>

1393
01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:42.463
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even a lot of white women have </v>

1394
01:12:44.181 --> 01:12:47.150
<v Speaker 2>extensions now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So extensions.</v>

1395
01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:47.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>extensions out and it's just like three </v>

1398
01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:58.650
<v Speaker 2>times as much volume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1399
01:12:58.651 --> 01:13:03.651
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really personally care that much</v>

1400
01:13:03.661 --> 01:13:05.450
<v Speaker 2>about the whole hair thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the hey,</v>

1401
01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.393
<v Speaker 2>women want to feel beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to do their thing and got in </v>

1402
01:13:08.491 --> 01:13:09.324
<v Speaker 2>Boston anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we apparently knows because they </v>

1403
01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:13.434
<v Speaker 2>spend a lot of time backstage together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tyra has fake hair and so that </v>

1404
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.410
<v Speaker 2>probably is what makes us even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing.</v>

1405
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.630
<v Speaker 2>So let us enjoy</v>

1406
01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:28.100
<v Speaker 4>the facial hair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does it feel with all that fake hair</v>

1407
01:13:28.101 --> 01:13:28.934
<v Speaker 4>on yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have no idea what that feels </v>

1408
01:13:29.721 --> 01:13:30.880
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

1409
01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:32.750
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't a fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was his real hair.</v>

1410
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:34.220
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1412
01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:41.200
<v Speaker 4>she has fake hair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a Joe Walsh.</v>

1413
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:43.940
<v Speaker 2>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1414
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:48.430
<v Speaker 2>He genuinely thinks that she's setting </v>
<v Speaker 2>them up for like a,</v>

1415
01:13:48.610 --> 01:13:51.080
<v Speaker 2>a gag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1416
01:13:51.081 --> 01:13:54.810
<v Speaker 2>It was he thinking and is just really </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to make a joke,</v>

1417
01:13:54.811 --> 01:13:56.510
<v Speaker 2>but it was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1418
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:58.650
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what it feels like.</v>

1419
01:13:58.651 --> 01:14:00.330
<v Speaker 2>That fake hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1420
01:14:00.331 --> 01:14:03.210

1421
01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I think he really was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did I say here?</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's okay.</v>

1425
01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.880

<v Speaker 11>I'm serious,</v>

<v Speaker 11>hand while I'm talking with my left.</v>

1519

<v Speaker 11>And it's not petty.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You fucking disrespected my mother and </v>

1523
01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.010
<v Speaker 2>And Joey does tend to think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever he does on youtube doesn't mean</v>

1524
01:18:38.011 --> 01:18:41.790
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a fake black lives matter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's the guy from rocky.</v>

1532
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:12.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean he looks like he's on his way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot a gay porn.</v>

1533
01:19:12.201 --> 01:19:14.900
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to say like this is like,</v>

1534
01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:16.450

<v Speaker 2>It's got the pink top</v>

<v Speaker 2>Thank God not to this level.</v>

1538
01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>

1539
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:33.200
<v Speaker 2>what's the good amount of muscle for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

1540
01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:34.233
<v Speaker 2>Well there's some in his new vlog where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were pointing out to me are today </v>

1541
01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.393
<v Speaker 2>were his big driving his car and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>dear friend is recording from the side </v>

1542
01:19:42.671 --> 01:19:44.830
<v Speaker 2>and his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like taking up the whole screen.</v>

1543
01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.420
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1544
01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:52.120
<v Speaker 2>I get the feeling like when dudes get </v>
<v Speaker 2>this jacked,</v>

1545
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:53.343
<v Speaker 2>they do it for each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that many women like </v>

1546
01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:01.150
<v Speaker 2>that's why I like trying to say bar </v>
<v Speaker 2>women with all the surgeries.</v>

1547
01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.553
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it becomes like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition between themselves and I </v>

1548
01:20:05.171 --> 01:20:06.970
<v Speaker 2>don't even think of the guys even care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1549
01:20:06.971 --> 01:20:07.804
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like of course like a jack do with like </v>

1550
01:20:10.651 --> 01:20:15.570
<v Speaker 2>a six pack is attractive and looks good </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you like that.</v>

1551
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:18.360
<v Speaker 2>But like at what point like here at Dan </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sent me this photo.</v>

<v Speaker 2>jacked,</v>

1553
01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:22.493
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's just the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with him in the </v>

1554
01:20:25.561 --> 01:20:26.460
<v Speaker 2>before picture.</v>

1555
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.590

<v Speaker 2>you're an everyday man girl.</v>

1557
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at any rate,</v>

1558
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him,</v>

<v Speaker 2>dudes and they're all getting like </v>

<v Speaker 2>checking each other out and they're all </v>

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1572
01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.640

01:24:02.850 --> 01:24:07.820
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of pretty goopy type of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1626
01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:10.683
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we spoke briefly about goop before </v>

1627
01:24:12.011 --> 01:24:12.844
<v Speaker 2>because they got in trouble for selling </v>
<v Speaker 2>stickers that were apparently and fused </v>

1628
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:22.590
<v Speaker 2>with NASA technology to increase your </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy level.</v>

1629
01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:25.690
<v Speaker 2>And that's the total scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

1630
01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:26.913
<v Speaker 2>But now they're back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're being sued again because they </v>

1631
01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:33.630
<v Speaker 2>have vaginal eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1632
01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.760
<v Speaker 2>jade eggs that you insert in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>vagina.</v>

1633
01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:39.713
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me pull up some pictures that are </v>

1634
01:24:42.341 --> 01:24:43.760
<v Speaker 2>appropriate for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>let me show you this.</v>

1639
01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:54.753
<v Speaker 2>So it's like an egg that you shove up </v>
<v Speaker 2>your badge and you keep it there like </v>

1640
01:24:56.951 --> 01:24:59.320

<v Speaker 2>full moon,</v>

01:27:17.331 --> 01:27:19.470
<v Speaker 2>the clench or recharge it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Or You could burn sage.</v>

1683
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:24.763
<v Speaker 2>The egg does absorb energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I like how they go from NASA energy </v>

1684
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:32.380
<v Speaker 2>to Chinese,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1688
01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:42.740
<v Speaker 2>before I insert an egg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do our ritual.</v>

1689
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 2>I'll place it on a beautiful piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fabric,</v>

1690
01:27:44.661 --> 01:27:45.494
<v Speaker 2>light a candle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then shove it up my fucking nasty </v>

1691
01:27:47.211 --> 01:27:49.670
<v Speaker 2>snatch for my ritual.</v>

1692
01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:50.533
<v Speaker 2>I'll imagine pure light flowing from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty snatch and shove an egg in there </v>

1693
01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.280
<v Speaker 2>who really expensive that's supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>likes,</v>

1694
01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything it's due.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's somewhere in there.</v>

1695
01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:02.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1696
01:28:02.811 --> 01:28:04.280
<v Speaker 2>it's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's some lady,</v>

1697
01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:09.740
<v Speaker 2>one of their editors I would assume </v>
<v Speaker 2>always rapped the egg and sell,</v>

1698
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:14.600
<v Speaker 2>keep it clean and start on an altar on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the why.</v>

1699
01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:17.830
<v Speaker 2>It should take a sacred place in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and alter does that,</v>

1700
01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:23.440
<v Speaker 2>it's like a sacred podium and an egg </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets stuck or lost?</v>

1701
01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't a good question.</v>

1702
01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:31.760
<v Speaker 2>This is the most common question we get </v>
<v Speaker 2>and no,</v>

1703
01:28:31.761 --> 01:28:32.594
<v Speaker 2>it cannot get lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depending on the size of your cabin or </v>

1704
01:28:35.031 --> 01:28:40.031
<v Speaker 2>as cavernous giant vege it could get </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost for a couple of weeks depending on,</v>

1705
01:28:42.610 --> 01:28:44.900
<v Speaker 2>on uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how fast your vagina is.</v>

1706
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:47.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say no it cannot get lost.</v>

1707
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.823
<v Speaker 2>What about stock?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are ones that have a toll </v>

1708
01:28:51.221 --> 01:28:52.054
<v Speaker 2>drilled in them so that you can bungy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and splunk into her vagina and follow </v>

1709
01:28:56.521 --> 01:28:59.120
<v Speaker 2>the lifeline to the egg.</v>

1710
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Now you can put a through the egg and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it easy to take out.</v>

1711
01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Like way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were to spelunk into a cavern,</v>

<v Speaker 2>do not use it out of people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you're pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not shove that egg in there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>or the recharge by the energy of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>

1740
01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck yeah.</v>

1741
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:49.910

<v Speaker 2>Fortnight has been said it and more than</v>

1742
01:30:49.911 --> 01:30:53.570
<v Speaker 2>200 divorce proceedings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1743
01:30:53.571 --> 01:30:56.030
<v Speaker 2>There's really nothing more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And finally guys,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I have got an email to close up the show</v>
<v Speaker 2>today from a sweet young man named </v>

1749
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Daniel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1750
01:31:13.971 --> 01:31:14.804
<v Speaker 2>Daniel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like many of you out there are young </v>

1751
01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:19.100
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impressionable minds who are looking for</v>

1752
01:31:19.101 --> 01:31:21.560
<v Speaker 2>answers and better ways to live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more holistic,</v>

1753
01:31:21.561 --> 01:31:26.561
<v Speaker 2>a natural life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he heard our discussion mine and um,</v>

1754
01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:32.360
<v Speaker 2>burt's about wiping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we wipe from the front that we march</v>

1755
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:36.410
<v Speaker 2>to the beat of our own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we marched,</v>

1756
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:38.360
<v Speaker 2>we marched from the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Others,</v>

1757
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:40.910
<v Speaker 2>they wiped from the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The normal.</v>

1758
01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal is a subjective term,</v>

1759
01:31:43.681 --> 01:31:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Mila.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want him to go that far.</v>

1760
01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I say a normal man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Standard Pazi body positivity.</v>

1761
01:31:52.730 --> 01:31:53.563
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to read this email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a great email and I </v>

1762
01:31:55.491 --> 01:31:57.170
<v Speaker 2>wanted to share it with all you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1763
01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:58.573
<v Speaker 2>and it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it created a new dimension on this </v>

1764
01:32:01.121 --> 01:32:03.730
<v Speaker 2>whole conversation about front wiping </v>
<v Speaker 2>verse back,</v>

1765
01:32:03.731 --> 01:32:07.360
<v Speaker 2>wiping something that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was an unintended consequence,</v>

1766
01:32:07.361 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 2>but a wonderful consequence of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1767
01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:12.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me begin here.</v>

1768
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:20.690
<v Speaker 2>Dear Ethan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 25 years,</v>

1769
01:32:21.230 --> 01:32:22.063
<v Speaker 2>I have been a back wiping neanderthal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today I am proud to say that I have </v>

1770
01:32:26.661 --> 01:32:27.494
<v Speaker 2>thrown in the toilet paper and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed to front wiping moving </v>

1771
01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:32.233
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was first introduced to front wiping </v>

1772
01:32:34.761 --> 01:32:38.900
<v Speaker 2>in high school when a participant on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality show reveal to his peers that he</v>

1773
01:32:38.901 --> 01:32:39.734
<v Speaker 2>wiped from the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the other people on the show was </v>

1774
01:32:42.651 --> 01:32:43.484
<v Speaker 2>disgusted by the thought of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It garnered the typical reaction that </v>

1775
01:32:47.331 --> 01:32:48.164
<v Speaker 2>most unenlightened people have where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they imagined smearing feces up their </v>

1776
01:32:51.801 --> 01:32:52.634
<v Speaker 2>ball sack.</v>

1777
01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:53.953
<v Speaker 2>Out of my own curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried it one day and confirm my own </v>

1778
01:32:56.301 --> 01:32:59.840
<v Speaker 2>suspicion that it wasn't insufficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of cleaning my ass.</v>

1779
01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:02.810
<v Speaker 2>And due to my naivety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

1780
01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:06.950
<v Speaker 2>oh due to my own naivety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

1781
01:33:07.130 --> 01:33:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I now realize I was doing it incorrectly</v>
<v Speaker 2>by converting my own stand up,</v>

1782
01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:16.910
<v Speaker 2>back wiping technique to a front style </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was wildly uncomfortable.</v>

1783
01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Fast forward 10 years later and a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>fan of your show,</v>

1784
01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I was disappointed to be faced with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

1785
01:33:23.781 --> 01:33:24.614
<v Speaker 2>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you spoke with Tom Sikora and Chris </v>

1786
01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Delea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found myself disagreeing with you as I</v>

1787
01:33:29.571 --> 01:33:33.170
<v Speaker 2>had an already settled this debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself as a teenager.</v>

1788
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:34.783
<v Speaker 2>It was not until your episode with Bert </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kreischer that I was willing to give </v>

1789
01:33:37.131 --> 01:33:37.964
<v Speaker 2>front what being a second chance when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned that you remain seated through </v>

1790
01:33:42.591 --> 01:33:43.424
<v Speaker 2>the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized I had made a mistake in my </v>

1791
01:33:46.041 --> 01:33:46.874
<v Speaker 2>past experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then something that either you or bird </v>

1792
01:33:49.641 --> 01:33:53.900
<v Speaker 2>said really clicked with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not make sense to wipe a whole.</v>

1793
01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:59.140
<v Speaker 2>It needs to be a scoop in order to clean</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do believe that was after this,</v>

1794
01:34:01.911 --> 01:34:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I was reading in three Coupe Ila please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about scooping.</v>

1795
01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:09.650
<v Speaker 2>This is personal and spiritual.</v>

1796
01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:12.553
<v Speaker 2>After this I was ready to truly open </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself to change and why I'm wiping </v>

1797
01:34:15.921 --> 01:34:18.680
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While it felt a bit weird at first,</v>

1798
01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:23.420
<v Speaker 2>I have been blown away by the results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>

1799
01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:27.560
<v Speaker 2>it is more natural reach as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the awkward and standing up and reaching</v>

1800
01:34:27.561 --> 01:34:29.420
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to stand up.</v>

1801
01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:33.770
<v Speaker 2>I stay seated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people stand up.</v>

1802
01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:34.813
<v Speaker 2>You guys back there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you stand up when you wipe from the </v>

1803
01:34:36.291 --> 01:34:38.300
<v Speaker 2>back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1804
01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:40.880
<v Speaker 2>it's more of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a slight lift and you left.</v>

1805
01:34:41.370 --> 01:34:43.910
<v Speaker 2>You left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1806
01:34:43.911 --> 01:34:46.820
<v Speaker 2>it's still technically seated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say somewhere in between.</v>

1807
01:34:46.821 --> 01:34:47.654
<v Speaker 2>It's a lift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of standalone wipe again can I </v>

1808
01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:50.640
<v Speaker 2>didn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1809
01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is emotional.</v>

1810
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:55.610
<v Speaker 2>This is important to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>

1811
01:34:55.611 --> 01:34:56.444
<v Speaker 2>it is more natural reach as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the awkward standup and reaching </v>

1812
01:34:59.391 --> 01:35:00.740
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secondly,</v>

1813
01:35:00.741 --> 01:35:05.741
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to perform a quick couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scoop scoop.</v>

1814
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:07.790
<v Speaker 2>It's what he Rowan's when I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>

1815
01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:08.624
<v Speaker 2>This is the truth as opposed to a rough </v>
<v Speaker 2>wipe that only makes the task harder as </v>

1816
01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:16.610
<v Speaker 2>you smear shit up your ass crack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And lastly,</v>

1817
01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:19.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to finish in less wipes with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaner result.</v>

1818
01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to thank you for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>continued efforts.</v>

1819
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:27.920
<v Speaker 2>If you are truly the Nelson Nelson </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mandela of wiping,</v>

1820
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:32.420
<v Speaker 2>and I feel as if I am not the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>person to be converted by your wisdom.</v>

1821
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:34.123
<v Speaker 2>I had doubts about this technique for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decade and I can only think about all </v>

1822
01:35:38.391 --> 01:35:41.300
<v Speaker 2>the wasted time I've spent using an </v>
<v Speaker 2>insufficient,</v>

1823
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:42.583
<v Speaker 2>inefficient wiping motion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recommend all back wipers give it one </v>

1824
01:35:47.031 --> 01:35:52.031
<v Speaker 2>week trial because the result is truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>life changing.</v>

1825
01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Thank you're sincerely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10:00</v>

1826
01:35:57.230 --> 01:35:58.063
<v Speaker 2>PM I do not use baby wipes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard nothing but horror stories </v>

1827
01:36:02.001 --> 01:36:03.000
<v Speaker 2>about the dam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1828
01:36:03.001 --> 01:36:03.834
<v Speaker 2>and now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

1829
01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:06.890
<v Speaker 2>You had me until you started talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit on baby wipes,</v>

1830
01:36:06.891 --> 01:36:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Daniel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know I really wonderful.</v>

1831
01:36:10.101 --> 01:36:10.934
<v Speaker 2>I think I was moved because I was never </v>
<v Speaker 2>my intention to convert anyone ever </v>

1832
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:21.500
<v Speaker 2>thought it was my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a misunderstood soul,</v>

1833
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:22.423
<v Speaker 2>a victim of my own excess of wiping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I hope that it doesn't switch back </v>

1834
01:36:28.231 --> 01:36:33.231
<v Speaker 2>once he understands that it doesn't need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stand up to wipe from the Mac did.</v>

1835
01:36:34.231 --> 01:36:36.480
<v Speaker 2>It's been wiping his ass his whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows what he's doing.</v>

1836
01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly,</v>

1837
01:36:40.321 --> 01:36:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Zack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just heard our sound guy,</v>

1838
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:47.160
<v Speaker 2>he's our sound intern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's helping us out with sound.</v>

1839
01:36:48.190 --> 01:36:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told me today that he in his house,</v>

1840
01:36:51.601 --> 01:36:55.260
<v Speaker 2>they don't even have toilet paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go pure wet wipe,</v>

1841
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:58.470
<v Speaker 2>which I've never thin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen that.</v>

1842
01:36:58.770 --> 01:37:01.950
<v Speaker 2>And frankly I find it a little strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I would never,</v>

1843
01:37:01.951 --> 01:37:06.951
<v Speaker 2>I would never recommend a start wet </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's just asking for trouble.</v>

1844
01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:11.370
<v Speaker 2>I recommend to Zach and to all anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else out there,</v>

1845
01:37:11.371 --> 01:37:15.210
<v Speaker 2>you have to take a hybrid approach </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you want to start try and what?</v>

1846
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:17.340
<v Speaker 2>So Zach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome aboard.</v>

1847
01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Pretty strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zach,</v>

1848
01:37:21.361 --> 01:37:26.361
<v Speaker 2>do you wipe from the front or the back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you talk into the mic method?</v>

1849
01:37:28.290 --> 01:37:30.420
<v Speaker 2>You serious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1850
01:37:30.750 --> 01:37:31.583
<v Speaker 2>First I was doing before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I tried it out and I happen to </v>

1851

1866
01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:07.403
<v Speaker 2>You're telling me that you wiped from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bat until you heard this show and </v>

1867
01:38:11.371 --> 01:38:12.204
<v Speaker 2>then based on my anecdote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you decided to lift your own balls and </v>

1868
01:38:15.541 --> 01:38:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Dick and one hand reach under them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>scoop out the shit from the front.</v>

1869
01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:23.580
<v Speaker 2>100% I cannot remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you prefer it?</v>

1870
01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I do prefer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1871
01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Wait and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Ian is a front in.</v>

1872
01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that we've ever asked you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and where,</v>

1873
01:38:34.821 --> 01:38:38.070
<v Speaker 2>where do you wipe from it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we did from the front seat.</v>

1874
01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:41.670
<v Speaker 2>And then then you're in back white boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

1875
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan is the odd man out here for one.</v>

1876
01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:48.030
<v Speaker 2>And then have you always wiped from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>front?</v>

1877
01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:50.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I converted probably a high school.</v>

1878
01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you convert?</v>

1879
01:38:53.251 --> 01:38:56.550
<v Speaker 2>What makes you say to yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of your life that you're going to</v>

1880
01:38:56.551 --> 01:38:59.700
<v Speaker 2>start lifting up your dick and balls and</v>
<v Speaker 2>scooping out shit from underneath it?</v>

1881
01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:00.953
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that that was possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think someone in a show set </v>

1882
01:39:04.861 --> 01:39:05.880
<v Speaker 2>it and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1883
01:39:06.690 --> 01:39:09.510
<v Speaker 2>That's madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried it and I never went back.</v>

1884
01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:13.690
<v Speaker 2>And you think it's superior?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely bogus.</v>

1885
01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Truly a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd been saying,</v>

1886
01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:21.320
<v Speaker 2>have you tried it now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know I did.</v>

1887
01:39:21.630 --> 01:39:22.261
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1888
01:39:22.261 --> 01:39:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I gave it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave it an honest go coop.</v>

1889
01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:28.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some stupid,</v>

1890
01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1891
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:29.783
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1892
01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:31.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be objective.</v>

1893
01:39:31.741 --> 01:39:32.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am like,</v>

1894
01:39:32.570 --> 01:39:33.690
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go into it without bias.</v>

1895
01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't like it.</v>

1896
01:39:34.650 --> 01:39:35.483
<v Speaker 2>Now Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me what you were sitting on the </v>

1897
01:39:36.331 --> 01:39:37.710
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1898
01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:41.520
<v Speaker 2>And generally where I did my business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just want to make sure you did the</v>

1899
01:39:41.521 --> 01:39:43.120
<v Speaker 2>technique right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what?</v>

1900
01:39:43.530 --> 01:39:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Which hand did you wipe with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1901
01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:46.390
<v Speaker 2>well I'm a righty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with the,</v>

1902
01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:48.540
<v Speaker 2>you lifted your balls and deck with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>left hand,</v>

1903
01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:53.250
<v Speaker 2>you remained seated a yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you went in with the right hand</v>

1904
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:55.890
<v Speaker 2>in under underhanded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>underhanded technique.</v>

1905
01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you do it.</v>

1906
01:39:56.970 --> 01:39:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I nailed it.</v>

1907
01:39:58.290 --> 01:39:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I think I nailed the technique and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1908
01:39:59.851 --> 01:40:03.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may need to try it to the group mix.</v>

1909
01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Make an egg in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm down for that for sure.</v>

1910
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Chuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris.</v>

1911
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to tell you,</v>

1912
01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.710
<v Speaker 2>this was an eye opening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This whole saga,</v>

1913
01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:17.520
<v Speaker 2>not only with sac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a recent convert at that Ian Independent</v>

1914
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:19.440
<v Speaker 2>and Ian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a talented young man.</v>

1915
01:40:19.441 --> 01:40:20.274
<v Speaker 2>He'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell he's got a good head on his </v>

1916
01:40:20.761 --> 01:40:23.130
<v Speaker 2>shoulders and high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said to himself,</v>

1917
01:40:23.131 --> 01:40:23.964
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be a better way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was converted from that first </v>

1918
01:40:26.401 --> 01:40:27.750
<v Speaker 2>scoop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I find that powerful.</v>

1919
01:40:28.230 --> 01:40:30.750
<v Speaker 2>We just found out two conversions in one</v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

1937
01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:27.453
<v Speaker 2>However the numbers chuckles back here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the numbers are low because I </v>

<v Speaker 2>heard people say it wasn't showing up.</v>

01:41:41.951 --> 01:41:44.890
