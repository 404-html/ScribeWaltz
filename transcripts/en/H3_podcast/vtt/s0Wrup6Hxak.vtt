3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sure we'd make it to 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a bumpy road.</v>

4
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:20.380
<v Speaker 1>We had some ups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had some downs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but here we are for better or worse </v>

11
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:41.854
<v Speaker 1>club now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today is also very coincidentally the </v>

12
00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:48.670
<v Speaker 1>last episode of the year which happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>so perfectly.</v>

13
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.683
<v Speaker 1>I was going to lie and say it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode 100 today just so we could hit </v>

14
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:54.880
<v Speaker 1>that milestone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't need the lie.</v>

15
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>It was episode 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually was that.</v>

16
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.353
<v Speaker 1>I was in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to skip 99 so we're </v>

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.040
<v Speaker 1>going to skip that and just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

18
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 1>You guys are talking about but magically</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's episode 100.</v>

19
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>We have so much a look back on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So today what we're going to do,</v>

20
00:01:11.861 --> 00:01:15.970
<v Speaker 1>and I think is going to be a lot of fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I'm going to bring in and Dan out,</v>

21
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:16.804
<v Speaker 1>we're going to all sit here and share </v>
<v Speaker 1>our favorite and our worst moments of </v>

22
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>the first 100 episodes because think </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to our first episode was Pewdie Pie</v>

23
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>sitting in his rental house in La and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

24
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.773
<v Speaker 1>you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we weren't live streaming for like </v>

25
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>the first 10 or 15 episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like eight.</v>

26
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.793
<v Speaker 1>And we had like a really weird desk here</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one and the guests would sit on </v>

27
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>this purple couch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very strange,</v>

28
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.573
<v Speaker 1>but the big breakthrough I think came </v>
<v Speaker 1>for us when we started live streaming </v>

29
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we got this table Ed,</v>

30
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.500
<v Speaker 1>we started to feel the format more.</v>

31
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 1>And obviously I'm still developing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

32
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

33
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please God let there be room to grow.</v>

34
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.583
<v Speaker 1>We haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always said that the rule is the </v>

35
00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:08.524
<v Speaker 1>first hundred or you don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing until the first hundred </v>

36
00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

37
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>that's what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

38
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.500
<v Speaker 1>and kind of a master now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please God,</v>

39
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.750
<v Speaker 1>let that be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

40
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.550
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been so much to learn.</v>

41
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Someone said that you don't know until </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 2:50</v>

42
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 1>episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

43
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 1>we gotta we gotta push that back because</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that we're at $100,</v>

44
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:29.044
<v Speaker 1>the pressure's on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard Joe Rogan say you don't know </v>

45
00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:32.494
<v Speaker 1>until a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think we still have a lot of room </v>

46
00:02:36.431 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.383
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to bring everyone out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a ton of great things to look </v>

48
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:43.301
<v Speaker 1>back on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

49
00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:44.134
<v Speaker 1>we've been doing this for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took us two years to get to 100 </v>

50
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:46.990
<v Speaker 1>episodes.</v>

51
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of great moments that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgot even happened that we're going to</v>

52
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:52.540
<v Speaker 1>look over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.003
<v Speaker 1>so I can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super excited and just everyone </v>

54
00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:59.140
<v Speaker 1>who's tuned in and stuck around for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild.</v>

55
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been an incredible journey here and</v>

56
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to getting to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before we do,</v>

57
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>we had our huge charity stream on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday,</v>

58
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>which we streamed for eight and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours the longest day of my life.</v>

59
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Still recovering from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was absolutely brutal.</v>

60
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>And against all odds we hit $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

61
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't believe it.</v>

62
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>I had to live because I was sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still kind of sick.</v>

63
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.333
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got home and I think you just raised </v>

67
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.050

<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't believe it.</v>

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 1>And Dan has been with us longer than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>

233
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

234
00:11:58.691 --> 00:11:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

235
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy how times past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here we are.</v>

236
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll,</v>

237
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:08.350
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about our favorite moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

238
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.630
<v Speaker 1>How should we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a bunch of mine.</v>

239
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they should present first?</v>

240
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Because I have a shit ton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys have less than me now.</v>

241
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Well you have like the general stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that came from fans.</v>

242
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>

243
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I've got it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do those first.</v>

244
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 1>So this is everything from the first 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes now.</v>

245
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Joey Salads from the last charity </v>
<v Speaker 1>stream.</v>

246
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:34.930
<v Speaker 1>This will always go down as one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite moments and as history.</v>

247
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Now the backstory of this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

248
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.050
<v Speaker 1>because at the time we weren't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipped to live stream,</v>

249
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.560
<v Speaker 1>so joey salads live streamed it from his</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone on his personal twitch gentle that</v>

250
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.050
<v Speaker 1>went across the street from the office </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>

251
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:53.723
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we watched it with a delay but we had </v>

252
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.253
<v Speaker 1>them on the phone so we were hearing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audio through the phone and then </v>

253
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:04.201
<v Speaker 1>watching his stream which made it better</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we heard the screaming about 15,</v>

254
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.160
<v Speaker 1>20 seconds before the impact.</v>

255
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.790
<v Speaker 1>And I love how just so casually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>calmly,</v>

256
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Justin has accepted the bird pepper </v>
<v Speaker 1>spraying jelly south.</v>

257
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.660
<v Speaker 1>He loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had no hesitation,</v>

258
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.680
<v Speaker 1>just seemed there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the legendary moment.</v>

259
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.603
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and funnily Joey Salads was banned from </v>

260
00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.090
<v Speaker 1>twitter for doing a dangerous act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

261
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.030
<v Speaker 1>but art fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

262
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:33.820
<v Speaker 1>poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was three a reinstated.</v>

263
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.173
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joy.</v>

264
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Without further ado,</v>

265
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:54.290
<v Speaker 5>who was recording?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was it like being there?</v>

266
00:13:57.421 --> 00:14:01.770
<v Speaker 5>Seeing that this was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've only been here a couple of weeks at</v>

267
00:14:01.771 --> 00:14:02.604
<v Speaker 5>the time and I remember I called my mom </v>
<v Speaker 5>after I was like a guy just got pepper </v>

268
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:11.030
<v Speaker 5>spray work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You afraid that it will reach,</v>

269
00:14:11.031 --> 00:14:13.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't feel it.</v>

270
00:14:13.321 --> 00:14:14.154
<v Speaker 5>I kept the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so to this day Joe says that was </v>

271
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.040
<v Speaker 5>infinitely worse than a spicy pepper </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to help you guys.</v>

272
00:14:33.811 --> 00:14:38.040
<v Speaker 5>Kept it real professional.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ian's following the action camera work.</v>

273
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.950
<v Speaker 5>It's Kinda like when you're filming like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a wildlife shot and like a,</v>

274
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.710
<v Speaker 5>like a gator is attacking a deer and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can intervene and save the day.</v>

275
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.810
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just watch the pain nature play on</v>

276
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Star Trek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rules of a non intervention.</v>

277
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 2>It's the first protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first prime directive.</v>

278
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ian had a prime directive and you wonder</v>

279
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:05.594
<v Speaker 2>how could we top it next year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to have to throw them </v>

280
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:11.000
<v Speaker 2>off a building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kinda,</v>

281
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of an issue because um,</v>

282
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:14.763
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went for broke on that first one and </v>

283
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 2>then because joey got a got banned as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>result,</v>

284
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.600
<v Speaker 2>were a little reluctant to go that far </v>
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>

285
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what happened,</v>

286
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:28.020
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to shoot him with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonlethal been back,</v>

287
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.710
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

288
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.210
<v Speaker 2>that's not gonna fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have to.</v>

289
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.590
<v Speaker 2>The thing about the spicy peppers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's very painful,</v>

290
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.483
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Youtube doesn't see it as like a </v>

291
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.210
<v Speaker 2>bantible fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we can get a professional stuntman</v>

292
00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:45.044
<v Speaker 2>and like a safety crew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may be able to throw them off a </v>

293
00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:47.504
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe next time we can get some </v>

294
00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:52.094
<v Speaker 2>submissions because I get some ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a year lot of people listening </v>

295
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.013
<v Speaker 2>and next up buggy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now buggy is such an incredible guests </v>

296
00:15:59.721 --> 00:16:04.721
<v Speaker 2>because he always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't hold back and he has a,</v>

297
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.360
<v Speaker 2>he had a story on his last visit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>dating a feeder.</v>

298
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Just such a pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a pleasure.</v>

299
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 2>And so here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

300
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:14.910
<v Speaker 2>oh she like,</v>

301
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:15.743
<v Speaker 6>come in and I'm so sorry to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is great cookies and she's laid </v>

302
00:16:22.501 --> 00:16:25.740
<v Speaker 6>them across your chest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>down her stomach to make an arrow to her</v>

303
00:16:25.741 --> 00:16:26.574
<v Speaker 6>vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then she had filled her Vagina </v>

304
00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.970
<v Speaker 6>Maraschino cherries for dessert.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Swear to God.</v>

305
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.910
<v Speaker 6>And my first thought is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you are going to get a yeast infection.</v>

306
00:16:38.911 --> 00:16:43.020
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like don't put food in your vagina.</v>

307
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.020
<v Speaker 6>How many of you stuffed in there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Six or seven.</v>

308
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.863
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I was experiencing in my </v>

309
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.110
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

310
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.960
<v Speaker 6>this is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then do what you gotta do it.</v>

311
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

312
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.660
<v Speaker 6>this was news to me out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

313
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.543
<v Speaker 6>quite,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quite,</v>

314
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:57.840
<v Speaker 6>quite literally.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

315
00:16:57.841 --> 00:16:58.674
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

316
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.930
<v Speaker 6>and then we've been together for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I got sick.</v>

317
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.900
<v Speaker 6>I got like an infection in my leg,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is like real frequent.</v>

318
00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.360
<v Speaker 6>I get in with the Olympic team all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>time and I'm like,</v>

319
00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:10.470
<v Speaker 6>I gotta go to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was like,</v>

320
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.690
<v Speaker 6>they're going to make you lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

321
00:17:12.691 --> 00:17:12.961
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

322
00:17:12.961 --> 00:17:13.830
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's going to be fine.</v>

323
00:17:13.831 --> 00:17:17.660
<v Speaker 6>I go into the store to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>hospital and I'm like,</v>

324
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.860
<v Speaker 6>mom,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

327
00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.490
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's faking the infection.</v>

328
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 6>How do you fake an infection?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you pitch was twisted?</v>

329
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

330
00:17:36.581 --> 00:17:37.371
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

331
00:17:37.371 --> 00:17:40.060
<v Speaker 2>what ultimately is the goal of feeding </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone the,</v>

332
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.760
<v Speaker 2>that that leads to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one path.</v>

333
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.283
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it mentioned in this highlight </v>

334
00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:49.130
<v Speaker 2>is that he did eat the cherries out of,</v>

335
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 4>of her agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a guy.</v>

336
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:53.991
<v Speaker 4>What a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

337
00:17:53.991 --> 00:17:55.590
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the,</v>

338
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.453
<v Speaker 4>on the highlight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a comment from some guy </v>

339
00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:58.921
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lady,</v>

340
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:01.050

<v Speaker 4>I'm 300 pounds.</v>

341
00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:01.923
<v Speaker 4>I put on weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if green Japan's qualifies </v>

342
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 4>yet because Mcgee said he was at like </v>
<v Speaker 4>500.</v>

343
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:09.803
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I guess he's got lots of ways to go </v>

344
00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:12.340
<v Speaker 4>have a for feeder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot.</v>

345
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 4>It's a long road to go together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

346
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 4>oh this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now this one I completely forgot.</v>

347
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:22.600
<v Speaker 4>This was submitted by a fan and this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we had ty Lopez on the cloud guys.</v>

348
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.873
<v Speaker 4>And we got him good because we had this </v>
<v Speaker 4>video where we went to his house and he </v>

349
00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:29.604
<v Speaker 4>had a lawyer's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a troop of lawyers following me the </v>

350
00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:32.724
<v Speaker 4>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We decided to get him back when he came </v>

351
00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:40.590
<v Speaker 4>on our own podcast and we hired an extra</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you found on craigslist,</v>

352
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.390
<v Speaker 4>right then?</v>

353
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.940
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

354
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Well I didn't actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Craigslist,</v>

355
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.420
<v Speaker 4>we all forgot that we did that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We saw the submission saying,</v>

356
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.570
<v Speaker 4>how'd you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how'd you find them?</v>

357
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:52.890
<v Speaker 4>How to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what'd you mark put up?</v>

358
00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 4>Just need an actor for one day for like </v>
<v Speaker 4>an hour.</v>

359
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.460
<v Speaker 4>I got a lot of weird people so that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>a little but kind of comb through it.</v>

360
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:02.694
<v Speaker 4>And then he was very game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We like put them in the closet because </v>

361
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.920
<v Speaker 4>you never know what you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>with craigslist.</v>

362
00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:15.480
<v Speaker 4>Especially actors are already all weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>and craigslist senators bottom.</v>

363
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.793
<v Speaker 4>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hit the Jackpot with that guy </v>

364
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:19.620
<v Speaker 4>because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy was,</v>

365
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.570
<v Speaker 4>he played it completely straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing.</v>

366
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.583
<v Speaker 4>He sat in our tiny little closet room </v>
<v Speaker 4>for like an hour at least just because </v>

367
00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:28.640
<v Speaker 4>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just being there,</v>

368
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.953

<v Speaker 4>go do it quick because you can't come </v>

369
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.953
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

370
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.690
<v Speaker 4>He was so game to totally cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what did we pay them?</v>

371
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

372
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.933
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably probably more than girls get </v>

373
00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:41.814
<v Speaker 4>for kissing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Prank almost started a couple of </v>

374
00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.250
<v Speaker 4>hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was an easy day for him.</v>

375
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.400
<v Speaker 4>A couple hours after he had a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

376
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 4>I remember afterwards then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that guy.</v>

377
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.520
<v Speaker 4>He recognized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

415
00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:18.474
<v Speaker 1>This shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever we ever started the podcast </v>

416
00:22:20.521 --> 00:22:21.354
<v Speaker 1>starring your boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he had attorneys to </v>

417
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 1>explained that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The SOS.</v>

421
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Michael here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my all time favorite guests.</v>

422
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Another guy is an open book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious.</v>

423
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:48.650
<v Speaker 1>We talked to him about taking Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a psychedelic drug.</v>

424
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.793
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was a wonderful </v>

425
00:22:52.321 --> 00:22:55.520
<v Speaker 1>conversation by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just realized that Dan is here.</v>

426
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.700
<v Speaker 1>It tells us about break time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

427
00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.380
<v Speaker 1>it was telling us about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

428
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.310
<v Speaker 1>is it break?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been keeping an eye on the clock to</v>

429
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.740
<v Speaker 1>3:45</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be 30 minutes late.</v>

430
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Vsauce is coming back our first episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>back 25th of January.</v>

431
00:23:12.901 --> 00:23:14.820
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be joined by vsauce again.</v>

432
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.380
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very much looking forward to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

433
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.980
<v Speaker 1>But here he talks about taking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drug,</v>

434
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just the combination of him,</v>

435
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.070
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics and youtube red is just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

436
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Those three things together is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you would expect that he had a</v>

437
00:23:33.481 --> 00:23:34.590
<v Speaker 1>lot of interesting things to say.</v>

438
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.480
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My heart was going.</v>

439
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.310
<v Speaker 5>It was literally beating very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually,</v>

440
00:23:38.311 --> 00:23:39.990
<v Speaker 5>there's a moment where I touch my chest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

441
00:23:39.991 --> 00:23:40.920
<v Speaker 5>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's really happening.</v>

442
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.710
<v Speaker 5>But then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do I let the doctor know?</v>

443
00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:45.610
<v Speaker 5>Because</v>

444
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 7>I can't think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

445
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 7>this is not how I normally feel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is it weird if I just say,</v>

446
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm help,</v>

447
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.260
<v Speaker 7>how are they going to interpret that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so I just,</v>

448
00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.500
<v Speaker 7>I thought maybe I'll just ask for water,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

449
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.513
<v Speaker 7>maybe that like will tether me back down</v>
<v Speaker 7>to reality because someone will have to </v>

450
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:05.120
<v Speaker 7>bring me water.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's a really.</v>

451
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.813
<v Speaker 7>I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel like I've been in that headspace </v>

452
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:08.730
<v Speaker 7>of training.</v>

453
00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.620
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see me talk.</v>

454
00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.310
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was great.</v>

455
00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.293
<v Speaker 2>Love vsauce talking about that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was so analytical about his </v>

456
00:24:18.991 --> 00:24:19.824
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know it most people who do </v>

457
00:24:21.721 --> 00:24:22.554
<v Speaker 2>that are looking for some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual connection and he was more </v>

458
00:24:25.351 --> 00:24:30.270
<v Speaker 2>just trying to like appreciate what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening to him the entire time.</v>

459
00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.220
<v Speaker 2>It was really cool to hear him talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

460
00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

461
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:33.963
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to just put Michael in a </v>

462
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.730
<v Speaker 2>room and just give them all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs and just,</v>

463
00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>record him.</v>

469
00:24:52.471 --> 00:24:53.304
<v Speaker 2>on the 25th now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now garth brooks is somewhat of a </v>

470
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.400
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon here and on other podcasts as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well because he's just such a legend and</v>

471
00:25:01.561 --> 00:25:05.550
<v Speaker 2>there's one video specifically of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Garth's that I love where he goes.</v>

472
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.930
<v Speaker 2>He's sitting in his hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I,</v>

473
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.580
<v Speaker 2>why don't we just watch it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly can't.</v>

474
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch this too many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Garth Brooks face,</v>

475
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

476
00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch this video too many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's truly a masterpiece.</v>

477
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:21.870
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess it's official.</v>

478
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:23.303
<v Speaker 7>We're now on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really wasn't sure about this to </v>

479
00:25:25.351 --> 00:25:27.780
<v Speaker 7>start,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then a friend of mine said something</v>

480
00:25:27.781 --> 00:25:28.614
<v Speaker 7>they just made also.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She said think of it more as a </v>

481
00:25:30.961 --> 00:25:35.961
<v Speaker 7>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm already finding out on my own.</v>

482
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.880
<v Speaker 7>So it's wiping the walls out between you</v>
<v Speaker 7>and me.</v>

483
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.550
<v Speaker 7>And I really liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It allows us into each other's world.</v>

484
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:43.781
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

485
00:25:43.781 --> 00:25:45.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>title Garth Brooks,</v>

486
00:25:45.481 --> 00:25:47.820
<v Speaker 2>first facebook post and video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

487
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.340
<v Speaker 2>Authentic and transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

488
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.780
<v Speaker 2>That's funny because when I watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

489
00:25:51.781 --> 00:25:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I see like the opposite</v>

490
00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 7>my case.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

491
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.050
<v Speaker 7>tell me about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This.</v>

492
00:26:01.051 --> 00:26:01.880
<v Speaker 7>Reminds me of title</v>

493
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.713
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my garage video in that it tries to </v>

494
00:26:05.061 --> 00:26:07.250
<v Speaker 2>look authentic and natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

495
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.570
<v Speaker 2>he's done it a thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take 40,</v>

496
00:26:09.571 --> 00:26:10.404
<v Speaker 2>you'd lose for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like the type of video you'd make </v>

497
00:26:13.461 --> 00:26:15.650
<v Speaker 2>from the bunker after the bombs have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fallen.</v>

498
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.160
<v Speaker 2>I really like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

499
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:19.994
<v Speaker 2>it'd be fun is to just maybe do like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>go fund me and then run this as a </v>

500
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.280
<v Speaker 2>youtube provable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go find me for people to donate and then</v>

501
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:31.483
<v Speaker 2>you use all that money as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a community and you use this as a </v>

502
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:37.580
<v Speaker 2>youtube pre roll so people just get this</v>
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

503
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh a go fund me to pay to have this as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an APP.</v>

504
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's just constantly popping up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of.</v>

505
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.430
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

506
00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:46.743
<v Speaker 2>he's not selling anything but I wonder </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get pissed or if you'd loved </v>

507
00:26:50.331 --> 00:26:52.910
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked that.</v>

508
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.053
<v Speaker 2>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

509
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.163
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be great.</v>

510
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Let's try it to go fund me.</v>

511
00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.490
<v Speaker 7>Think about things I want to post to </v>
<v Speaker 7>post cool stuff,</v>

512
00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.390
<v Speaker 7>slick stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 7>neat stuff,</v>

513
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.380
<v Speaker 7>but most of the stuff I'm going to post </v>
<v Speaker 7>it gonna be raw stuff like this.</v>

514
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.760
<v Speaker 7>That's just who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Truly a conversation tonight.</v>

515
00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.440
<v Speaker 7>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They let the conversation begin</v>

516
00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:16.443
<v Speaker 2>and iconically after saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let the conversation begin and was the </v>

517
00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:21.753
<v Speaker 2>last video he ever poked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say let the compensation and incredible </v>

518
00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.573
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen that until you showed it </v>

519
00:27:30.971 --> 00:27:33.780
<v Speaker 2>to me and know I find myself doing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

520
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:38.200
<v Speaker 2>I liked helping people think you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>being strange because they don't.</v>

521
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done the without a doubt.</v>

522
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.300
<v Speaker 2>That happens to me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to watch it so many times,</v>

523
00:27:43.301 --> 00:27:45.220
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't know what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

524
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know but.</v>

525
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.390
<v Speaker 2>But it's wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was somewhat underground,</v>

526
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.970
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of people are picking </v>
<v Speaker 2>up on it now.</v>

527
00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.013
<v Speaker 2>But the great moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite moments was we had </v>

528
00:27:54.251 --> 00:27:55.084
<v Speaker 2>Chris Delea on and I saw that he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>garth brooks fan and the similar sense </v>

529
00:28:01.241 --> 00:28:04.600
<v Speaker 2>that I was right and I says to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pitched him this idea,</v>

530
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:05.443
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

531
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:06.303
<v Speaker 2>you know what I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to recreate this video word for </v>

532
00:28:08.801 --> 00:28:10.630
<v Speaker 2>word and just post it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

533
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I think I've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

534
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:14.663
<v Speaker 2>So here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we discovered that he did it and he </v>

535
00:28:16.301 --> 00:28:17.134
<v Speaker 2>didn't even remember or recreate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to upload this to my youtube </v>

536
00:28:19.511 --> 00:28:21.250
<v Speaker 2>channel on edited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

537
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.940
<v Speaker 2>I think I did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did.</v>

538
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.870
<v Speaker 2>You recreated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

539
00:28:28.871 --> 00:28:33.871
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent the video to grow your role.</v>

540
00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.050
<v Speaker 2>I know I sent it to Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bryan County.</v>

541
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I ever uploaded it.</v>

542
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.560
<v Speaker 5>700 views.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was some random person,</v>

543
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.470
<v Speaker 5>but somehow it's just five months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not even that long ago.</v>

544
00:28:54.471 --> 00:28:59.471
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So somebody found him first.</v>

545
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.960
<v Speaker 5>I really wasn't sure about this start.</v>

548
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:10.583

561
00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.573
<v Speaker 5>but did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A friend of mine said something that </v>

562
00:29:50.171 --> 00:29:52.780
<v Speaker 5>made all kinds of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>

563
00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:58.010
<v Speaker 5>just think of it as a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that one.</v>

564
00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:58.933
<v Speaker 5>I'm already noticing myself is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>wiping away the walls of communication </v>

565
00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:04.120
<v Speaker 5>between you and me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

566
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:09.121
<v Speaker 5>I really liked that line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is an invitation to fuck.</v>

567
00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.460
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>

571
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.950

<v Speaker 5>or in my case,</v>

572
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:32.100
<v Speaker 5>my hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the cool stuff,</v>

573

<v Speaker 5>neat stuff,</v>

574
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:42.110

<v Speaker 5>stuff like this because it's who I am.</v>

575
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.270
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess if this is a conversation,</v>

576
00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:50.760

<v Speaker 5>The conversation began.</v>

577
00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.213
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

578
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:58.600
<v Speaker 1>stumbled upon that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like accidentally go and as he said,</v>

579
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:59.443
<v Speaker 1>it's now from 700 to 50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't anyone ever say that we here at </v>

580

<v Speaker 1>was it his last appearance?</v>

733
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

734
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.130
<v Speaker 1>there was the live show after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

735
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during one of his appearances here,</v>

736
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.983
<v Speaker 1>Patrice Wilson started live streaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>some really creepy stuff that seemed to </v>

737
00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:49.684
<v Speaker 1>be directed towards me and we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this unfold live and it was </v>

738
00:38:53.771 --> 00:38:54.890
<v Speaker 1>very spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

739
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.350
<v Speaker 1>so he started broadcasting just a shower</v>
<v Speaker 1>curtain.</v>

740
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Three x three was in the title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

741
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:07.570
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll look for yourself.</v>

742
00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

743
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:15.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that creepy fucking screens,</v>

744
00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.070
<v Speaker 4>dude?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have chosen.</v>

745
00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:20.180
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know there was so creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a CD screen,</v>

746
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:24.110
<v Speaker 4>like a screen with a gun in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just moving behind it.</v>

747
00:39:24.111 --> 00:39:24.944
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not a screen that scared the </v>

748
00:39:38.121 --> 00:39:39.270
<v Speaker 4>shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Turn this off.</v>

749
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.590
<v Speaker 4>So we were all getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were all getting the.</v>

750
00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

751
00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Patrice Wilson is already a guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little strange.</v>

752
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.890
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the fairway,</v>

753
00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:00.750
<v Speaker 1>but I just thought it really scared the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit out of me when I saw this and it.</v>

754
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:02.110
<v Speaker 1>And it continues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

755
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.490
<v Speaker 1>so this happened early on in the episode</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we closed it.</v>

756
00:40:06.491 --> 00:40:06.941
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

757
00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:08.410
<v Speaker 1>we can't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is way too scary.</v>

758
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:13.830
<v Speaker 1>And later on the live chat was saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's back and it's changed and this part</v>

759
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:19.630
<v Speaker 1>really scared the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here you have it.</v>

760
00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:24.890
<v Speaker 4>He's got a countdown timer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a graveyard posts in a cemetery.</v>

761
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
<v Speaker 4>Griffey I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Goodbye.</v>

762
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:38.010
<v Speaker 4>Goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll spend the night with you.</v>

763
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:40.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm worried about December first.</v>

764
00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:41.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On December first,</v>

765
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:43.403
<v Speaker 4>let's do a getaway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be in la because he's </v>

766
00:40:45.721 --> 00:40:47.280
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>

767
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:50.800
<v Speaker 4>Let's just hold up with some shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking.</v>

768
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.680
<v Speaker 4>I've room in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not.</v>

769
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.990
<v Speaker 4>It's a very vulnerable and it makes me </v>
<v Speaker 4>very vulnerable.</v>

770
00:40:57.991 --> 00:40:58.824
<v Speaker 4>And you can attack from anyone here who </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows the way worse now I've got a </v>

771
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.380
<v Speaker 4>defensible high ground</v>

772
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.680
<v Speaker 1>when the time clock and ended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we left the house.</v>

773
00:41:08.681 --> 00:41:09.514
<v Speaker 1>We didn't want to be in the house just </v>
<v Speaker 1>in case I want you hiding in a grocery </v>

774
00:41:11.951 --> 00:41:12.784
<v Speaker 1>store park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the time when we got down to </v>

775
00:41:15.491 --> 00:41:18.190
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was getting more provocative and more</v>

776
00:41:18.191 --> 00:41:19.360
<v Speaker 1>threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt.</v>

777
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.850
<v Speaker 1>And I felt so unsafe in our last house </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well that I was like.</v>

778
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:26.260
<v Speaker 1>And we just had got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we have shutter at the time?</v>

779
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I was really scared for shredder and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

780
00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.020
<v Speaker 1>we packed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got shredder,</v>

781
00:41:32.021 --> 00:41:32.854
<v Speaker 1>we went in the car and we just drove </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a public parking lot and just held </v>

782
00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:38.750
<v Speaker 1>up for a couple of hours because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

783
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:39.584
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

785
00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:44.660
<v Speaker 1>I would have done at least that town for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

786
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:50.540
<v Speaker 1>But then patrice was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did everyone think this was creepy?</v>

787
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Rolling through a cemetery.</v>

788
00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:00.260
<v Speaker 1>There was even more heat directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressed to you at some point.</v>

789
00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:01.094
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

790
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

791
00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:03.321
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

792
00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:04.430
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

793
00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a wild one,</v>

794
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.790
<v Speaker 1>but it was special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shared it with post live and it was a</v>

795
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.470
<v Speaker 1>beautiful moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of many,</v>

796
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson hits the vape God.</v>

797
00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an internal debate and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>

798
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.590
<v Speaker 1>because we have retired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vape God.</v>

799
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.633
<v Speaker 1>And I think for guests like Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson is so fantastic to have them </v>

800
00:42:29.661 --> 00:42:30.494
<v Speaker 1>hit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isla hosted opinion and she's not </v>

801
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:35.050
<v Speaker 1>necessarily wrong that it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting and weird requests,</v>

802
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.770
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

803
00:42:37.771 --> 00:42:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She thinks it's dirty,</v>

804
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:41.650
<v Speaker 1>but we keep it clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't we?</v>

805
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you cleaned.</v>

806

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I and there's not much.</v>

807
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>

808
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:53.990
<v Speaker 1>we wipe off the tube and sterilize it </v>
<v Speaker 1>before somebody new hits it or whatever.</v>

809
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.823
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it's more so that it's like right </v>

810
00:42:58.191 --> 00:42:59.024
<v Speaker 1>off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people might feel obligated to do </v>

811
00:43:01.821 --> 00:43:02.654
<v Speaker 1>it when they really don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that starts the interview on a </v>

812
00:43:04.551 --> 00:43:05.720
<v Speaker 1>weird foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

813
00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.660
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as I guess we're about to see the</v>

814
00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:11.150
<v Speaker 1>person I thought would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell no.</v>

815
00:43:11.151 --> 00:43:13.580
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was super down.</v>

816
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:14.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

817
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.673
<v Speaker 1>Is that you on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say this was a little strange and </v>

818
00:43:19.131 --> 00:43:19.964
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know on the other hand you have </v>

819
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.030
<v Speaker 1>moments like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

820
00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.720
<v Speaker 1>So I'm happy to comply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rip It.</v>

821
00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

822
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.693
<v Speaker 1>I just breathe out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I got the button that rips </v>

823
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:35.570
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking legendary.</v>

824
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the cops are battery powered.</v>

825
00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.160
<v Speaker 1>He's Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's listen.</v>

826
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they know.</v>

827
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.430
<v Speaker 1>They know how to do this up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm impressive.</v>

828
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I remember he said a rituals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

829
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:02.180
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was He the first one?</v>

830
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:03.790
<v Speaker 1>We may do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

831
00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.660
<v Speaker 1>we had hardly and Bobby Lee and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody did it.</v>

832
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:11.840
<v Speaker 1>We had a lot of people doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he was the first time I was.</v>

833
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.530
<v Speaker 1>He was thinking that too because it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

834
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:15.523
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tastes like battery acid or some </v>

835
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.300
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

836
00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Sleeping that it goes through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

837
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.830
<v Speaker 1>It makes it taste a little funky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all good.</v>

838
00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.640
<v Speaker 1>He was unfazed back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It were older,</v>

839
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:32.220
<v Speaker 1>there was still</v>

840
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.440
<v Speaker 2>a clean hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as time has gone on,</v>

841
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:39.530
<v Speaker 2>it hits so harsh that you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>battery is the thing.</v>

842
00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:43.870
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was made as a prop and so you know,</v>

843
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.340
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily over the longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

844
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.520
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

845
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:48.354
<v Speaker 2>is that we need to build a more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more resilient little regarding not a </v>

846
00:44:51.631 --> 00:44:54.210
<v Speaker 2>prop center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

847
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.240
<v Speaker 2>if you own a vape company out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit us up podcasts@hvhcproductions.com.</v>

848
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Well that was a special moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of if it was right or wrong.</v>

849
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Justin Pranks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joel Osteen,</v>

850
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.180
<v Speaker 2>another great moment from last year's </v>
<v Speaker 2>charity event,</v>

851
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.513
<v Speaker 2>we called it Joel Osteen is this mega </v>
<v Speaker 2>preacher who was in the media at the </v>

852
00:45:16.831 --> 00:45:19.710
<v Speaker 2>time because he closed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had this horrible hurricane,</v>

853
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:24.210
<v Speaker 2>hurricane and tons of people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>homeless and without shelter.</v>

854
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:25.283
<v Speaker 2>And Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man of God had this mega church and </v>

855
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:28.224
<v Speaker 2>the worst area on the high ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely unaffected by the flooding </v>

856
00:45:31.471 --> 00:45:34.080
<v Speaker 2>and the church was closed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't letting anybody in there.</v>

857
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:35.423
<v Speaker 2>So he was getting slammed all throughout</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media and we took it upon ourselves </v>

858
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:39.623
<v Speaker 2>to vigilante justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Justin calls in Joel Osteen and the </v>

859
00:45:43.921 --> 00:45:46.920
<v Speaker 2>woman who answers is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

860
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:49.980
<v Speaker 2>lack of a better term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of a loony tune.</v>

861
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that's more than fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

862
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.113
<v Speaker 2>So here we go.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Everybody album's not coming out today.</v>

927
00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.830
<v Speaker 4>It was so obviously joking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the hell people.</v>

928
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:27.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was great.</v>

929
00:49:27.121 --> 00:49:30.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean huge like rolling stone billboard</v>
<v Speaker 4>poster,</v>

930
00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.960
<v Speaker 4>loan reveals and when I saw those </v>
<v Speaker 4>articles I was like,</v>

931
00:49:33.961 --> 00:49:35.250
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where did he say that?</v>

932
00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:38.140
<v Speaker 4>And then to find that it was our </v>
<v Speaker 4>strategy.</v>

933
00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.053
<v Speaker 4>Talking about poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny because they don't mention </v>

934
00:49:42.031 --> 00:49:42.240
<v Speaker 4>this yet.</v>

935
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.073
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just like post Malone said </v>

936
00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.420
<v Speaker 1>bastards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had mentioned the show.</v>

937
00:49:48.421 --> 00:49:49.560
<v Speaker 1>People would have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

938
00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:50.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

939
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:52.051
<v Speaker 1>Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

940
00:49:52.051 --> 00:49:52.884
<v Speaker 1>this was a moment that I personally </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved is that the night before the Jack </v>

941
00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.073
<v Speaker 1>Black episode aired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin reuland reached out to me and he </v>

942
00:50:01.261 --> 00:50:03.720
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know that I used to,</v>

943
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I met Jack Black Lung,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal,</v>

944
00:50:05.551 --> 00:50:08.910
<v Speaker 1>and he helped me pitch and sell my first</v>
<v Speaker 1>show ever.</v>

945
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:12.240
<v Speaker 1>And he's a huge inspiration to me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a huge help to me.</v>

946
00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.340
<v Speaker 1>And he sent me all this incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

947
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:16.920
<v Speaker 1>like pictures that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did it say?</v>

948
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

949
00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:21.360
<v Speaker 1>doors down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked the doors down,</v>

950
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:22.993
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had even done a cameo in his </v>

951
00:50:24.901 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>first show that he sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jack talking about how</v>

952
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.933
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

953
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.133
<v Speaker 4>Bob Odenkirk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bob Odenkirk and David Cross had given </v>

954
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 4>them their big break by putting them on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mr Show.</v>

955
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:39.560
<v Speaker 4>And so that Kinda gave me the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>end to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I understand that from a mutual friend </v>

960
00:50:48.351 --> 00:50:50.090
<v Speaker 4>of ours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are also an advocate.</v>

961
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.940

<v Speaker 4>somewhat of a surprise in what God is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Am I going to be surprised by someone </v>

963
00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.720
<v Speaker 4>from blast from my past going to enter </v>
<v Speaker 4>the room?</v>

964
00:50:58.770 --> 00:50:59.990
<v Speaker 4>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

965
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:01.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm really excited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A friend of mine,</v>

966
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:02.833
<v Speaker 4>I launched out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God because he heard you were going to </v>

967
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:06.950
<v Speaker 4>be a show and I don't know that you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>seen this.</v>

968
00:51:06.951 --> 00:51:08.990
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that you want to say for the</v>

969
00:51:08.991 --> 00:51:09.824
<v Speaker 4>record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of my favorite </v>

970
00:51:10.311 --> 00:51:11.930
<v Speaker 4>episodes we've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

971
00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:12.764
<v Speaker 4>I know it's recent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but honestly like to have the best </v>

972
00:51:14.091 --> 00:51:14.930
<v Speaker 4>guests we've ever had.</v>

973
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:16.400
<v Speaker 4>Just so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So funny.</v>

974
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:19.790
<v Speaker 4>They hung out before and after they sang</v>
<v Speaker 4>for us after that.</v>

975
00:51:19.791 --> 00:51:21.090
<v Speaker 4>It was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We probably never.</v>

976
00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.230
<v Speaker 4>Was that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can we have a wii?</v>

977
00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:25.880
<v Speaker 4>So Zach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's our sound lad,</v>

978
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:28.970
<v Speaker 4>he's a musician.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He shreds on guitar.</v>

979
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:31.310
<v Speaker 4>Well thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And He um,</v>

980
00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:33.253
<v Speaker 4>kyle gas is like a crazy shredder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so Zach and Kyle and Jack started </v>

981
00:51:37.731 --> 00:51:39.420
<v Speaker 4>jamming and sinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

982
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 4>Zach knew a master exploder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was a tenacious d song and uh,</v>

983
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.310
<v Speaker 4>I think it was asking Kyle about his </v>
<v Speaker 4>guitar.</v>

984
00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:47.031
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

985
00:51:47.031 --> 00:51:49.460
<v Speaker 4>take a look or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he just started busting out into the</v>

986
00:51:49.461 --> 00:51:52.670
<v Speaker 4>song and like I had like a split second </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment of like,</v>

987
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.600
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

988
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't try and show them up or whatever.</v>

989
00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.693
<v Speaker 4>I was completely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They immediately just launched into the </v>

990
00:52:00.081 --> 00:52:02.210
<v Speaker 4>song and they like play the entire song </v>
<v Speaker 4>with him,</v>

991
00:52:02.211 --> 00:52:03.800
<v Speaker 4>sing the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so cool.</v>

992
00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:05.150
<v Speaker 4>How was that for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zach?</v>

993
00:52:05.151 --> 00:52:07.490
<v Speaker 4>Who was one of the highlights of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

994
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:14.340
<v Speaker 4>I do have a video of it on my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I said,</v>

995
00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:15.680
<v Speaker 4>oh Sheila,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get that up.</v>

996
00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.193
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we can tweet it later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something to eat it later from the </v>

997
00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:19.910
<v Speaker 4>podcast flutter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be great.</v>

998
00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:20.763
<v Speaker 4>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just like he started singing and </v>

999
00:52:23.481 --> 00:52:25.010
<v Speaker 4>that was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1000
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:26.480
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe this is happening right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1001
00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:31.230
<v Speaker 4>I could tell on Zach's been living out a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fantasy for us.</v>

1002
00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they really,</v>

1003
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Jack Black is such a legend.</v>

1004
00:52:35.721 --> 00:52:36.554
<v Speaker 4>Like man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to be obsessed with his HBO </v>

1005
00:52:39.411 --> 00:52:41.150
<v Speaker 4>series is one of the funniest things </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

1006
00:52:41.151 --> 00:52:44.870
<v Speaker 4>And originally it really when we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>researching for them coming in.</v>

1007
00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:46.820
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as part of that,</v>

1008
00:52:46.821 --> 00:52:49.280
<v Speaker 4>I went back and watched some of it had </v>
<v Speaker 4>been years.</v>

1009
00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:53.180
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen it in forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Completely holds up so funny.</v>

1010
00:52:53.181 --> 00:52:56.620
<v Speaker 4>So it doesn't hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold up.</v>

1011
00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.193
<v Speaker 4>I find this joke a fairly tasteless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember the but babies in the </v>

1012
00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:04.950

<v Speaker 2>let me see because you did.</v>

1029
00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:56.283
<v Speaker 2>It can be able to convey that sincerity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Jack Black come up as good as it </v>

1030
00:54:02.041 --> 00:54:03.030

<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

1031
00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:07.440
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that Justin had the picture</v>
<v Speaker 2>still as good as it gathers polaroids.</v>

1032
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:08.220
<v Speaker 2>I guess they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

1033
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:11.150

<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

1035
00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:13.893

<v Speaker 2>because I showed them that clip and he </v>

1036
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:19.470
<v Speaker 2>cracked up laughing when Jack was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1037
00:54:19.471 --> 00:54:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Justin's a saver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because Justin is a hoarder.</v>

1038
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.183
<v Speaker 2>When you go in his house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to tell this guy doesn't </v>

1039
00:54:24.991 --> 00:54:27.420
<v Speaker 2>throw anything out there it is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe he sent me this photo</v>

1043
00:54:33.511 --> 00:54:35.550
<v Speaker 2>last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blow doors down.</v>

1044
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:42.050
<v Speaker 2>He's a saver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't believe how young men.</v>

1045
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.680

1052
00:55:09.571 --> 00:55:12.030
<v Speaker 2>best way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's just,</v>

1053
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.370
<v Speaker 2>he embraces these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like his game coming out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1057
00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:25.050
<v Speaker 2>but him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really is such a creative force and a</v>

1058
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:26.483
<v Speaker 2>truly an honor to consider him a friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was just really one of my </v>

1059
00:55:30.391 --> 00:55:33.510
<v Speaker 2>favorite moments probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there you have it.</v>

1060
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we got?</v>

1061
00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a great one.</v>

1062
00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost done with my list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

1063
00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Martin scarelli admits to doing crimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>

1064
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:52.700
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe I forgot this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is legendary.</v>

1065
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:53.693
<v Speaker 2>This was another one of those unplanned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful genius moments where we're </v>

1066
00:55:56.671 --> 00:55:57.504
<v Speaker 2>having a live show with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was eric and Jesse wellons </v>

1067
00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.673
<v Speaker 2>and somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was right after scarelli got </v>

1068
00:56:03.961 --> 00:56:07.740
<v Speaker 2>like a sentence that are convicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was convicted.</v>

1069
00:56:07.741 --> 00:56:08.574
<v Speaker 2>It was before the sentencing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is is key to why this was so </v>

1070
00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:13.884
<v Speaker 2>amazing because it was very much </v>
<v Speaker 2>underplaying how much punishment was </v>

1071
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:20.010
<v Speaker 2>coming as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know and he,</v>

1072
00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:20.893
<v Speaker 2>he seemed pretty confident when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying he seemed to have the feeling </v>

1073
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 2>that he was getting off with a slap on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrist and he,</v>

1074
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:28.990
<v Speaker 2>he asks us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1075
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:30.040
<v Speaker 2>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1076
00:56:30.041 --> 00:56:30.874
<v Speaker 2>I'm not admitting anything but how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much jail time would you do for </v>

1077
00:56:33.281 --> 00:56:34.600
<v Speaker 2>$100,000,000?</v>

1078
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:36.760

<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>

<v Speaker 2>chat.</v>

1089
00:57:02.651 --> 00:57:03.484
<v Speaker 2>trying to align it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we finally figured out and got them on </v>

1090
00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:06.373
<v Speaker 2>and and well here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me play the clip for you because </v>

00:57:08.531 --> 00:57:13.330
<v Speaker 2>this truly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in prison right now and I've always</v>

1092
00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:18.420
<v Speaker 2>suspected that this clip of him on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>show was played before the judge,</v>

1093
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:23.440
<v Speaker 2>once before sensitive thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1094
00:57:23.441 --> 00:57:27.770
<v Speaker 2>listen to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to this crazy question.</v>

1095
00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:33.460
<v Speaker 2>If you could make $100,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you had to go to jail,</v>

1096
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 2>how much time would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this related to your situation?</v>

1097
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally unrelated because you just spent</v>

1098
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.930
<v Speaker 2>$30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I flick your answer was sarcastic.</v>

1099
00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:46.070
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be a little bit of.</v>

1100
00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean for how much water mill?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundred million.</v>

1101
00:57:56.590 --> 00:58:01.590
<v Speaker 2>If I fucking Tony Sorento for $100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollars,</v>

1102
00:58:02.081 --> 00:58:04.980
<v Speaker 2>how much time would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He asked just money.</v>

1103
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:07.840
<v Speaker 2>How much time would I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And My,</v>

1104
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:09.520
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the orange.</v>

1105
00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:10.354
<v Speaker 2>Is the new black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it on the expense of people who </v>

1106
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:16.080
<v Speaker 2>suffers straight up like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1107
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:17.710
<v Speaker 2>serve a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a bunch of money.</v>

1108
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Nobody suffers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you.</v>

1109
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.760
<v Speaker 2>What would you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you do?</v>

1110
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Zero to zero to 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1111
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:30.780
<v Speaker 2>zero to 30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Criminal especially sense.</v>

1112
00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:38.620
<v Speaker 2>So even if you assume I'm guilty of not </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out of this with over 100 million</v>

1113
00:58:38.621 --> 00:58:43.621
<v Speaker 2>dollars and he locked the judge took all</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much all of his money.</v>

1114
00:58:43.811 --> 00:58:48.811
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Including honestly when,</v>

1115
00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:51.730
<v Speaker 2>why even go on at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's a cocky bitch.</v>

1116
00:58:51.731 --> 00:58:53.920
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't help but brag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1117
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.600
<v Speaker 2>And if he couldn't come help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1118
00:58:55.601 --> 00:58:58.780
<v Speaker 2>come on and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could make $100,000,000,</v>

1119
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.550
<v Speaker 2>how much time would you do it?</v>

1120
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:01.413
<v Speaker 2>Kept it kept going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this trans about how people just </v>

1121
00:59:03.431 --> 00:59:04.264
<v Speaker 2>don't understand that he's not scamming </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone is just messing with the </v>

1122
00:59:07.661 --> 00:59:09.940
<v Speaker 2>insurance companies to help fund more </v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

1123
00:59:09.941 --> 00:59:12.110
<v Speaker 2>And this dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1124
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a lot more about the topic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was totally.</v>

1125
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:16.783
<v Speaker 2>That's the talking point of all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical companies who jacked the </v>

1126
00:59:19.961 --> 00:59:20.794
<v Speaker 2>price up like a times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always say the same thing that he </v>

1127
00:59:23.391 --> 00:59:26.300
<v Speaker 2>was saying and I guess he convinced some</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that that's true,</v>

1128
00:59:26.301 --> 00:59:28.070
<v Speaker 2>but what they say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1129
00:59:28.071 --> 00:59:30.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by raising the price of 100 times,</v>

1130
00:59:30.681 --> 00:59:33.710
<v Speaker 2>we make it more accessible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a total,</v>

1131
00:59:33.711 --> 00:59:35.600
<v Speaker 2>like double speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>counterintuitive,</v>

1132
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:36.613
<v Speaker 2>but they say it gives us more money for </v>
<v Speaker 2>research and it helps us subsidize </v>

1133
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:40.034
<v Speaker 2>people who can't afford it except that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually no evidence of any of </v>

1134
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:45.980
<v Speaker 2>these guys giving it out for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they supposedly say they do.</v>

1135
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:47.173
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also the people that pay for it as </v>

1136
00:59:48.141 --> 00:59:48.974
<v Speaker 2>health insurance and government and </v>
<v Speaker 2>social security so ends up costing </v>

1137
00:59:51.201 --> 00:59:53.180
<v Speaker 2>taxpayers like a billion dollars.</v>

1138
00:59:53.250 --> 00:59:54.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or more,</v>

1139
00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:55.640
<v Speaker 4>probably a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1140
00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:57.180
<v Speaker 4>at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1141
00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:00.840
<v Speaker 4>and he also wasn't in that clip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I remember in that interview,</v>

1142
01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:01.830
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

1143
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:02.743
<v Speaker 4>I'll get six months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was his destiny and it's seven </v>

1144
01:00:05.311 --> 01:00:07.900
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more than six months.</v>

1145
01:00:07.901 --> 01:00:10.200
<v Speaker 4>And then they took money and they took </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Wu Tang album.</v>

1146
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:11.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1147
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:12.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there you have it.</v>

1148
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:17.950
<v Speaker 2>His story is one that's just so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating that he became so notorious.</v>

1149
01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.513
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said it in this interview and he's </v>

1150
01:00:20.991 --> 01:00:21.824
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's way bigger offenders than he is </v>

1151
01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:25.970
<v Speaker 2>that are way more powerful and way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthy and way more.</v>

1152
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1153
01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:28.183
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about way more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are predatory on a larger </v>

1154
01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:32.720
<v Speaker 2>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will avoid scrutiny.</v>

1155
01:00:32.721 --> 01:00:35.810
<v Speaker 2>But somehow he was made notorious by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>

1156
01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I guess because he's put himself out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there probably.</v>

1157
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.073
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sacrifice the anonymity that the other </v>

1158
01:00:40.791 --> 01:00:45.110
<v Speaker 4>guys like cherish in exchange for being </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a meme,</v>

1159
01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:47.300
<v Speaker 4>a meme,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord in the public eye.</v>

1160
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:50.310
<v Speaker 4>So you want it to be a cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>edgy.</v>

1161
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.200
<v Speaker 4>He paid the ultimate price.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is an interesting thing though,</v>

1162
01:00:54.201 --> 01:00:55.034
<v Speaker 4>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his big mistake in a way was just being </v>

1163
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.310
<v Speaker 4>honest about what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he just,</v>

1164
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:02.380
<v Speaker 4>he was kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is that?</v>

1165
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:03.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1166
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.513
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to make that argument that it </v>

1167
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:06.920
<v Speaker 4>wasn't fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1168
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:08.510
<v Speaker 4>obviously the court did not agree with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1169
01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1170
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:13.880
<v Speaker 4>but just raising the money and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

1171
01:01:13.881 --> 01:01:14.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1172
01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.790
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he said oftentimes was just,</v>

1173
01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these companies do this.</v>

1174
01:01:18.751 --> 01:01:19.584
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

1175
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:21.040
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1176
01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.570
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't on their investigations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1177
01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:26.180
<v Speaker 4>maybe not all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of them are.</v>

1178
01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.673
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he lost in the court of public opinion </v>

1179
01:01:28.731 --> 01:01:29.564
<v Speaker 4>and that's why everyone went after him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we have to be Hillary Clinton's DNA </v>

1180
01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:33.440
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

1181
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.420
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>

1182
01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:36.763
<v Speaker 4>That's the reason he ended up going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>prison is because he was on probation </v>

1183
01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:45.610
<v Speaker 4>and then he made a tweet sarcastically </v>
<v Speaker 4>asking anyone to get a sample of Hillary</v>

1184
01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:50.160
<v Speaker 4>Clinton's DNA so we could clone her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Said I have the sequences,</v>

1185
01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:55.690
<v Speaker 4>and so the judge determined that he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>hilarious,</v>

1186
01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:00.120
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They joke like probation.</v>

1187
01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:01.143
<v Speaker 4>He was out on bail and bond and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>removed his bail is a judge that he was </v>

1188
01:02:05.001 --> 01:02:07.730
<v Speaker 4>a threat to public safety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but actually he did.</v>

1189
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:10.520
<v Speaker 4>He ended up going to prison for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It had nothing to do with the medicine.</v>

1190
01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:12.920
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He defrauded investors,</v>

1191
01:02:12.921 --> 01:02:13.790
<v Speaker 4>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a,</v>

1192
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:17.870
<v Speaker 4>a hedge fund.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing stuff.</v>

1193
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1194
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:19.943
<v Speaker 4>It's like</v>

1195
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:21.323
<v Speaker 2>you're involved in so many shady things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went to prison for the one that </v>

1196
01:02:25.081 --> 01:02:27.560
<v Speaker 2>always the good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the good guy to him.</v>

1197
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.050
<v Speaker 2>Always remember Squirelly for rip her </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhombi.</v>

1198
01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's pull that up because that is </v>

1199
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.093
<v Speaker 2>generally up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd watch a scary movie that's probably </v>

1200
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:40.280
<v Speaker 2>coming late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1201
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.213
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would watch?</v>

1202
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would watch.</v>

1203
01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.353
<v Speaker 2>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

1204
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.700
<v Speaker 2>This is literally straight later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fascinating guy and I'll tell you</v>

1205
01:02:47.701 --> 01:02:48.534
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you he's streaming or </v>

1206
01:02:49.471 --> 01:02:50.304
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's always sitting alone home by </v>

1207
01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:54.330
<v Speaker 2>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's like the loneliest dude ever.</v>

1208
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:58.260
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here he is trolling CBS.</v>

1209
01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

1210
01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.813
<v Speaker 8>further away you talk about being upset.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Harambie who is the gorilla that was </v>

1211
01:03:03.181 --> 01:03:04.014
<v Speaker 8>killed at the Cincinnati Zoo on twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Talk about caring so much about them </v>

1212
01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:10.373
<v Speaker 8>that the life meant so much.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The Cincinnati Zoo was come out and </v>

1213
01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:16.460
<v Speaker 8>asked people to stop using means and </v>
<v Speaker 8>you've.</v>

1214
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.840
<v Speaker 8>You've used it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a lot of memes and social media.</v>

1215
01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:24.530
<v Speaker 8>How is this going to stop in order to </v>
<v Speaker 8>honor him?</v>

1216
01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.760
<v Speaker 8>So it was sort of moonlighting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Scientists,</v>

1217
01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.613
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

1218
01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.730
<v Speaker 8>I work a lot with nonhuman primates.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We call them in the labs NHP.</v>

1219
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:36.150
<v Speaker 8>So any rhesus monkeys capuchins all the </v>
<v Speaker 8>way up to the higher orders.</v>

1220
01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:41.700
<v Speaker 8>While my brother and I especially have </v>
<v Speaker 8>this deep fondness for,</v>

1221
01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:46.050
<v Speaker 8>for animals that are so close to humans,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so remarkably close,</v>

1222
01:03:46.051 --> 01:03:46.884
<v Speaker 8>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there are Benobos that can even </v>

1223
01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:48.803
<v Speaker 8>communicate with you on a one to one </v>
<v Speaker 8>level and tell jokes and be sarcastic </v>

1224
01:03:52.381 --> 01:03:53.760
<v Speaker 8>and funny and even flirt with you.</v>

1225
01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:56.520
<v Speaker 8>It's unbelievable how humanlike these </v>
<v Speaker 8>creatures are.</v>

1226
01:03:56.730 --> 01:04:01.730
<v Speaker 8>An idea that we just shot this whole one</v>
<v Speaker 8>day is the argument that is,</v>

1227
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.900
<v Speaker 8>to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's painful to even talk about this,</v>

1228
01:04:09.901 --> 01:04:14.640
<v Speaker 8>but back to the issue which is that in </v>
<v Speaker 8>in this country,</v>

1229
01:04:14.641 --> 01:04:18.540
<v Speaker 8>I don't think we value nonhuman primate </v>
<v Speaker 8>life the way we should.</v>

1230
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.700
<v Speaker 8>I think these animals actually should </v>
<v Speaker 8>have rights.</v>

1231
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:22.380
<v Speaker 8>We it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if they did Martin,</v>

1232
01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:24.960
<v Speaker 8>they wouldn't be able to be used in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>pharmaceutical industry,</v>

1233
01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:27.150
<v Speaker 8>which don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think they should be.</v>

1234
01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.090
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I do a lot of and I've,</v>

1235
01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:29.993
<v Speaker 8>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've overseen the death of thousands of </v>

1236
01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:38.121
<v Speaker 8>these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Rats and many times the overseeing.</v>

1237
01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:40.383
<v Speaker 8>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Every single pharmaceutical executive </v>

1238
01:04:42.751 --> 01:04:43.584
<v Speaker 8>house,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a Pfizer probably kills a million </v>

1239
01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:46.130
<v Speaker 8>animals here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's completely true.</v>

1240
01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:47.680
<v Speaker 8>That's fair to them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1241
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:48.890
<v Speaker 8>if that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can't tell.</v>

1242
01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:50.490
<v Speaker 8>I can't either,</v>

1243
01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:51.363
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because actually I do agree with what </v>

1244
01:04:53.911 --> 01:04:54.790
<v Speaker 2>he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

1245
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's such a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get a read on</v>

1246
01:04:57.550 --> 01:05:02.170
<v Speaker 8>when you talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It feels like it is very,</v>

1247
01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.440
<v Speaker 8>it was a moral decision.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>

1248
01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:06.490
<v Speaker 8>it's how you feel morally and yet when </v>
<v Speaker 8>you talk about drug prices,</v>

1249
01:05:06.491 --> 01:05:07.900
<v Speaker 8>when we were talking earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>

1250
01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.180
<v Speaker 8>and I know you're saying it should go to</v>
<v Speaker 8>the insurance company,</v>

1251
01:05:10.181 --> 01:05:11.860
<v Speaker 8>is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's up to the insurance companies.</v>

1252
01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:13.173
<v Speaker 8>But why not have that same moral </v>
<v Speaker 8>compassion for the way the system is </v>

1253
01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:16.930
<v Speaker 8>more moral,</v>
<v Speaker 8>compassionate?</v>

1254
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:17.651
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1255
01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:18.640
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that,</v>

1256
01:05:18.641 --> 01:05:20.000
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of them,</v>

1257
01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.250
<v Speaker 8>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 8>7,000</v>

1258
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:22.084
<v Speaker 8>rare diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's only five or six companies in </v>

1259
01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:26.080
<v Speaker 8>the world that care about those </v>
<v Speaker 8>diseases.</v>

1260
01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.190
<v Speaker 8>The pfizers,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the mercks,</v>

1261
01:05:27.191 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 8>the ASTRAZENECAS.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I care about the big sellers,</v>

1262
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:31.270
<v Speaker 8>but there's dying kids,</v>
<v Speaker 8>friends of mine,</v>

1263
01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:33.390
<v Speaker 8>like the closer brother's three kids </v>
<v Speaker 8>with Pekin.</v>

1264
01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.220
<v Speaker 8>I invented the first drug ever for Pekin</v>
<v Speaker 8>and these three kids,</v>

1265
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:37.630
<v Speaker 8>they are staring at their death </v>
<v Speaker 8>sentence.</v>

1266
01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.690
<v Speaker 8>They're teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>

1267
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:43.690
<v Speaker 8>I'm fighting my butt off to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to save them and need money to do that.</v>

1268
01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.180
<v Speaker 8>Investors don't care for these little </v>
<v Speaker 8>diseases and so forth,</v>

1269
01:05:46.181 --> 01:05:48.490
<v Speaker 8>so I think that a lot more compassion </v>
<v Speaker 8>than most people think.</v>

1270
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.490
<v Speaker 8>That's why I'm in the drug business,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but at the same time a nonhuman,</v>

1271
01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I find it also happens to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>lucrative,</v>

1272
01:05:55.530 --> 01:05:57.170
<v Speaker 1>but at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest in peace around.</v>

1273
01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.013
<v Speaker 1>We went down the hall a little bit too </v>
<v Speaker 1>far and finally my favorite top moment </v>

1274
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:05.250
<v Speaker 1>is dis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctor disrespect,</v>

1275
01:06:05.251 --> 01:06:08.500
<v Speaker 1>jumping through the roof and here we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

1276
01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:11.550
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1277
01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see here.</v>

1278
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.620
<v Speaker 1>You have knocked as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1279
01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Knocked his hair back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

1280
01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot I got all dressed up like that.</v>

1281
01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I need to do something in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

1282
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Character is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Prophecy.</v>

1283
01:06:31.050 --> 01:06:33.590
<v Speaker 1>We may have another clip of prophecy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1284
01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.600
<v Speaker 1>we have one coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a pretty special episodes.</v>

1285
01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to do something.</v>

1286
01:06:40.261 --> 01:06:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I like that get a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1287
01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.220
<v Speaker 1>worth mentioning is that a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized us.</v>

1288
01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:48.960
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any problem showing.</v>

1289
01:06:48.961 --> 01:06:53.610
<v Speaker 1>He's clearly shown himself out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>costume now as many of you have seen,</v>

1290
01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:57.660
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people were angry because </v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact they weren't even saying,</v>

1291
01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the highlight.</v>

1292
01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1293
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:05.390
<v Speaker 1>they were even saying that we purposely </v>
<v Speaker 1>such wishes.</v>

1294
01:07:05.551 --> 01:07:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I always resented that because first of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1295
01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.890
<v Speaker 1>what chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

1296
01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:11.813
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the episode we always go </v>

1297
01:07:13.351 --> 01:07:14.184
<v Speaker 1>to like a slate and go to the wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as soon as immediately as the is </v>

1298
01:07:17.551 --> 01:07:19.560
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes off his wig and classes and you</v>

1299
01:07:19.561 --> 01:07:20.394
<v Speaker 1>see him at a character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we do that at the end of every </v>

1300
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.440
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1301
01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.273
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no way to know that he was going </v>

1302
01:07:26.421 --> 01:07:28.940
<v Speaker 1>to take everything off immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our attention.</v>

1303
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I just did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1304
01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not actually in the episode because</v>

1305
01:07:32.521 --> 01:07:34.680
<v Speaker 1>we cut it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was only in the twitch.</v>

1306
01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.990
<v Speaker 1>On twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1307
01:07:36.991 --> 01:07:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Actually somebody submitted a stock sing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hymn,</v>

1308
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.730
<v Speaker 1>doxing him as their worst moment in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>email.</v>

1309
01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:47.550
<v Speaker 1>So I actually do have that clip because </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody re uploaded it,</v>

1310
01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:49.103
<v Speaker 1>which made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he is showing himself a bunch of </v>

1311
01:07:51.541 --> 01:07:52.920
<v Speaker 1>times even before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1312
01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:56.010
<v Speaker 1>even before that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

1313
01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.640
<v Speaker 1>what can you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a piece.</v>

1314
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.710
<v Speaker 1>There's always someone to complain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not intentional.</v>

1315
01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:02.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>

1316
01:08:02.841 --> 01:08:06.780
<v Speaker 1>People always assume the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've found they did it on purpose.</v>

1317
01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge plant.</v>

1318
01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason I went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1319
01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:14.160
<v Speaker 1>we're over and I'll take off your wig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1320
01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.133
<v Speaker 2>So there you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I've got two worst moments to share </v>

1321
01:08:20.091 --> 01:08:23.090
<v Speaker 2>with you guys just selected by you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are selected by me.</v>

1322
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1323
01:08:24.081 --> 01:08:26.330
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst moment we go way,</v>

1324
01:08:26.331 --> 01:08:27.164
<v Speaker 2>way back to our first live episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you guys have all seen this </v>

1325
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Joji Mehmed on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So bad way.</v>

1326
01:08:33.861 --> 01:08:38.861
<v Speaker 2>This was framed up just that we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1327
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.610
<v Speaker 2>We were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were like hours in.</v>

1328
01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I was so drunk at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just chit chatting.</v>

1329
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:48.620
<v Speaker 2>I think we were talking about how like </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the animal kingdom,</v>

1330
01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.800
<v Speaker 2>let's look at shredder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1331
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:53.250
<v Speaker 2>he's a serial rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1332
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Our dog and Fred or goes to the dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>park.</v>

1333
01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:56.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

1334
01:08:56.781 --> 01:08:59.360
<v Speaker 2>He goes out there and he'll fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that moves.</v>

1335
01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:01.600
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't ask for consent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will try.</v>

1336
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.520
<v Speaker 2>And my only point is that back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

1337
01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:07.400
<v Speaker 2>human beings like neanderthals or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1338
01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:09.350
<v Speaker 2>earlier form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even apes,</v>

1339
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.160
<v Speaker 2>they're out there.</v>

1340
01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.210
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that they're,</v>

1341
01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:13.380
<v Speaker 2>they fuck they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1342
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Just I'll say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1343
01:09:15.171 --> 01:09:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

1344
01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:19.700
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not thinking research,</v>

1345
01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:22.530
<v Speaker 2>just some stupid like conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1346
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Which is always what people get upset </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1347
01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.450
<v Speaker 2>which is a couple of people shooting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1348
01:09:29.451 --> 01:09:31.190
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a fucking idiot.</v>

1349
01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.053
<v Speaker 2>I didn't pretend to be anything more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than just a fucking idiot and in this </v>

1350
01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:36.680
<v Speaker 2>case a drunk idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that being said,</v>

1351
01:09:36.681 --> 01:09:38.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>offended by this,</v>

1352
01:09:38.571 --> 01:09:39.404
<v Speaker 2>but it was just funny how it played out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here I am talking about that or apps </v>

1353
01:09:43.581 --> 01:09:44.270
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1354
01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:45.103
<v Speaker 2>Our Art Watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neanderthal eulogies were probably just </v>

1355
01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:48.163
<v Speaker 2>breaking like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's definitely a neanderthal in </v>

1356
01:09:50.931 --> 01:09:53.240
<v Speaker 2>us to like conquer men want to like grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1357
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:54.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1358
01:09:54.591 --> 01:09:59.240
<v Speaker 2>women are in a nature setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to be conquered.</v>

1359
01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:05.230
<v Speaker 2>It came out and it was super weird and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Long Island.</v>

1360
01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Actually the most brilliant part about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1361
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:10.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most brilliant part about this is </v>

1362
01:10:12.111 --> 01:10:14.400
<v Speaker 2>that I'm sure he didn't know his face </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in.</v>

1363
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.090
<v Speaker 2>It's just pure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine,</v>

1364
01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.800
<v Speaker 2>pure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine reaction.</v>

1365
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:27.160
<v Speaker 2>It's pure silence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1366
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.510
<v Speaker 2>You got me good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that shot.</v>

1367
01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh stole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still see this posted all the time.</v>

1368
01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'll ever live that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got my good.</v>

1369
01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:42.380
<v Speaker 2>And then there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an honorable mention.</v>

1370
01:10:42.381 --> 01:10:46.910
<v Speaker 2>This is a new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new moment and I can't tell if</v>

1371
01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:47.744
<v Speaker 2>it's the best or worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here we are entering a new moment </v>

1372
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:56.870
<v Speaker 2>into the lexicon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this on the subreddit.</v>

1373
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:58.183
<v Speaker 2>Someone who follows my dad on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you know when somebody likes </v>

1374
01:11:00.951 --> 01:11:02.900
<v Speaker 2>something on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blows up on their feed.</v>

1375
01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:04.453
<v Speaker 2>So someone decided to follow my dad on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter and he posted this on the </v>

1376
01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:10.940
<v Speaker 2>subreddit and dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you,</v>

1377
01:11:10.941 --> 01:11:12.710
<v Speaker 2>but you got to know something.</v>

1378
01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:16.290
<v Speaker 2>Things just you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a public figure.</v>

1379
01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Now Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary liked a.</v>

1380
01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:24.780

<v Speaker 2>snaps to see how sexy yesterday was.</v>

1381
01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:29.370
<v Speaker 2>It's a girl eating out another girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad.</v>

1382
01:11:29.371 --> 01:11:31.260
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1383
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:34.320
<v Speaker 2>like you don't have to like porn elite </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to look at it,</v>

1384
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:37.330
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to slam a like on a </v>

<v Speaker 2>discovered this or I showed it to him.</v>

1387
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.890
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1388
01:11:43.891 --> 01:11:45.120
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so you know,</v>

1389
01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:48.640

<v Speaker 2>Probably Dad.</v>

1390
01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Just so you have to like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shows up on other people's feet.</v>

1391
01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Had to play it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

1392
01:11:54.301 --> 01:11:56.220
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said something like,</v>

1393
01:11:56.221 --> 01:11:58.410
<v Speaker 2>freedom with a bunch of exclamation </v>
<v Speaker 2>marks,</v>

1394
01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.160
<v Speaker 2>a legend and a dad find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at porn.</v>

1395
01:12:06.001 --> 01:12:09.000
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can just imagine this poor guy who</v>

1396
01:12:09.001 --> 01:12:11.060
<v Speaker 2>followed him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who decided to follow my gut.</v>

1397
01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Just scrolling this twitter feed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Gary likes.</v>

1398
01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:21.060
<v Speaker 2>It's such an old people facebook thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so brutal.</v>

1399
01:12:21.781 --> 01:12:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't decide if that's the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there you have a gear.</v>

1400
01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:29.170
<v Speaker 2>So I will now pass it off to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1401
01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:31.810
<v Speaker 2>you want to switch seats with me or no</v>

1402
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:32.833
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's.</v>

1403
01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:34.440
<v Speaker 9>So.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's just two links.</v>

1404
01:12:36.230 --> 01:12:38.480
<v Speaker 9>So set aside,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh well,</v>

1405
01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:43.220
<v Speaker 9>it's kind of a rough change from the </v>
<v Speaker 9>last one.</v>

1406
01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:46.730
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I guess one of my favorite moments,</v>

1407
01:12:46.731 --> 01:12:49.430
<v Speaker 9>I don't know if it's like favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's weird to describe it,</v>

1408
01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:53.300
<v Speaker 9>but having a total biscuit on the show </v>
<v Speaker 9>and um,</v>

1409
01:12:53.301 --> 01:12:58.301
<v Speaker 9>later that year he passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So that was just a surreal,</v>

1410
01:13:00.321 --> 01:13:01.154
<v Speaker 9>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 9>experienced have here and they talked </v>

1411
01:13:03.621 --> 01:13:04.454
<v Speaker 9>about cancer and yet having him on here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm so thankful that we had the </v>

1412
01:13:09.411 --> 01:13:13.790
<v Speaker 9>opportunity to have him on the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so on the show when we did.</v>

1413
01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.880
<v Speaker 9>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So here's the little excerpt that,</v>

1414
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:17.750
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>from,</v>

1415
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:20.750
<v Speaker 9>from him talking about living with stage</v>
<v Speaker 9>four cancer,</v>

1416
01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:23.090
<v Speaker 9>let's make sure at that time counts for </v>
<v Speaker 9>something.</v>

1417
01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:26.870
<v Speaker 9>A lot of it is also,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you assume at this age you've got,</v>

1418
01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:28.580
<v Speaker 9>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've got 50,</v>

1419
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:31.190
<v Speaker 9>60 years with the family.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What if you didn't?</v>

1420
01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.860
<v Speaker 9>While we know you don't know how long </v>
<v Speaker 9>you've got,</v>

1421
01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:34.813
<v Speaker 9>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>make me want to try and be a better dad </v>

1422
01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:40.760
<v Speaker 9>was not out about that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I wanted to connect more with my stepson</v>

1423
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:42.710
<v Speaker 9>and then I have and I've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 9>that.</v>

1424
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:46.010
<v Speaker 9>I want to connect more with my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 9>make sure that we get a good to,</v>

1425
01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:47.810
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we get go to run out of it.</v>

1426
01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:48.913
<v Speaker 9>I intended to be around when I'm fucking</v>
<v Speaker 9>100 years old will be still bitching </v>

1427
01:13:51.981 --> 01:13:52.814
<v Speaker 9>about video games if I can be,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but sometimes that might be something </v>

1428
01:13:56.631 --> 01:13:58.350
<v Speaker 9>outside of my control it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1429
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:59.203
<v Speaker 9>maybe fighting isn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Maybe that's just not enough to keep </v>

1430
01:14:03.021 --> 01:14:03.854
<v Speaker 9>going,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but if that's the case then you've got </v>

1431
01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:08.630
<v Speaker 9>to make sure that you spend the time </v>
<v Speaker 9>you've got in the best way you can.</v>

1432
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 9>And even then it's not like it changes </v>
<v Speaker 9>you overnight.</v>

1433
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.680
<v Speaker 9>Like you still want to go read reddit </v>
<v Speaker 9>comments.</v>

1434
01:14:13.681 --> 01:14:15.830
<v Speaker 9>You still want to go that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>People on twitter,</v>

1435
01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.560
<v Speaker 9>like you can't change the habit of a </v>
<v Speaker 9>lifetime,</v>

1436
01:14:17.561 --> 01:14:18.394
<v Speaker 9>but there's something in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 9>your mind that they have something bad </v>

1437
01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:22.820
<v Speaker 9>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1438
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:25.330
<v Speaker 9>maybe that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that does change over time.</v>

1439
01:14:25.331 --> 01:14:26.164
<v Speaker 9>I think.</v>

1440
01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.033
<v Speaker 1>Well and some burly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did pass away I think like five or </v>

1441
01:14:33.891 --> 01:14:38.540
<v Speaker 1>six months or maybe even less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really shocked me.</v>

1442
01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he seemed.</v>

1443
01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:41.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he was in pain and he was on </v>

1444
01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:44.890
<v Speaker 1>chemo and you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very,</v>

1445
01:14:45.090 --> 01:14:47.360
<v Speaker 1>he was very optimistic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a fighter.</v>

1446
01:14:47.361 --> 01:14:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about this disease,</v>

1447
01:14:49.311 --> 01:14:50.144
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't show like you don't use the </v>

1448
01:14:52.011 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 1>person looks the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1449
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.770
<v Speaker 1>So you just don't see the decline in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their status.</v>

1450
01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.830
<v Speaker 1>And it was the same with my dad up until</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last moment.</v>

1451
01:15:00.831 --> 01:15:02.960
<v Speaker 1>He looked healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it looked fine.</v>

1452
01:15:02.961 --> 01:15:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even lose his hair and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>will look the same.</v>

1453
01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's shocking when it happens,</v>

1454
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:11.310
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1455
01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.910
<v Speaker 1>thought it would be cool to remember him</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

1456
01:15:13.911 --> 01:15:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1457
01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I had watched him all growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1458
01:15:18.361 --> 01:15:22.220
<v Speaker 1>like he was the starcraft guy and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played a ton of starcraft growing up,</v>

1459
01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:25.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that was surreal to even have him</v>

1460
01:15:25.881 --> 01:15:26.714
<v Speaker 1>in there at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to hear him talking about his </v>

1461
01:15:29.841 --> 01:15:32.840
<v Speaker 1>disease like that and so openly and with</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much optimism.</v>

1462
01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:33.683
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

1463
01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.160
<v Speaker 1>that was a special one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was cool.</v>

1464
01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:37.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cherish that.</v>

1465
01:15:37.461 --> 01:15:41.180
<v Speaker 1>I look at the picture of us on the wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>like somewhat regularly.</v>

1466
01:15:41.181 --> 01:15:42.014
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1467
01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:44.493
<v Speaker 1>And so last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I remember from that interview was </v>

1468
01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:49.360
<v Speaker 1>he kept saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1469
01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.513
<v Speaker 1>five of my days are bad and two of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>are good and that's enough for me to </v>

1470
01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.193
<v Speaker 1>comment.</v>

1471
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:58.423
<v Speaker 10>[inaudible]</v>

1472
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:59.743
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He left a hole in the gaming community </v>

1473
01:16:02.511 --> 01:16:03.830
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That hasn't really been filled.</v>

1474
01:16:03.831 --> 01:16:07.270
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's such a unique voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1475
01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.700
<v Speaker 1>that is definitely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1476
01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.060
<v Speaker 1>well God bless him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Hammond,</v>

1477
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Carl Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was data.</v>

1478
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so fucking heartbreaking.</v>

1479
01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:23.503
<v Speaker 1>All happened at the same year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we've ever talked about </v>

1480
01:16:26.121 --> 01:16:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Carl did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>

1481
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:33.140
<v Speaker 1>we may have mentioned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a fan who,</v>

1482
01:16:33.141 --> 01:16:33.974
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a rare type of cancer that ate fat </v>

1483
01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:39.830
<v Speaker 1>cells in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Rare.</v>

1484
01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.340
<v Speaker 1>So there's very little research about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to cure it.</v>

1485
01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he actually was a,</v>

1486
01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.220
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1487
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:53.380
<v Speaker 1>a little chunky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like originally before he had cancer,</v>

1488
01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:57.950
<v Speaker 1>kind of a larger guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the time I met him,</v>

1489
01:16:57.951 --> 01:17:00.470
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he looked like,</v>

1490
01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.273
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1491
01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.600
<v Speaker 1>like anorexic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1492
01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:11.890
<v Speaker 1>And so he had awful rare form of cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just eating all this,</v>

1493
01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.530
<v Speaker 1>a fat cells away until he just perished </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1494
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:17.103
<v Speaker 1>just wasted away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he wrote us an email and we reached </v>

1495
01:17:20.151 --> 01:17:20.984
<v Speaker 1>out and we sent them gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a huge fan of teddy fresh and </v>

1496
01:17:24.021 --> 01:17:24.854
<v Speaker 1>like he was a big fan of ours and I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>played pub g with him a couple of times </v>

1497
01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:34.160
<v Speaker 1>and we kept in regular contact and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was such a sweet fucking dude.</v>

1498
01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:36.980
<v Speaker 1>He was such a sweet dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is such a great outlook,</v>

1499

1530
01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:16.613

<v Speaker 1>I think this was the last thing I've </v>

1531
01:19:19.050 --> 01:19:19.883
<v Speaker 1>ever seen was him being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally didn't preorder this because </v>

1532
01:19:23.010 --> 01:19:26.580
<v Speaker 1>they have been super hand play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:19:28.150 --> 01:19:29.280
<v Speaker 1>He was a sweet kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1534
01:19:29.281 --> 01:19:34.281
<v Speaker 1>He was a fucking real sweet dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a part of the podcast,</v>

1535
01:19:35.341 --> 01:19:39.450
<v Speaker 1>but something that definitely we </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>

1536
01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But either you do have.</v>

1537
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have the worst snow.</v>

1538
01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:46.373
<v Speaker 4>So what's your worst?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you thought that very optimistic </v>

1539
01:19:51.531 --> 01:19:56.090
<v Speaker 4>person today though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I.</v>

1540
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:56.923
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the worst one was actually when I </v>

1541
01:19:58.401 --> 01:20:00.280
<v Speaker 4>went to Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1542
01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:03.020
<v Speaker 4>This actually works out because your </v>
<v Speaker 4>worst is actually pretty fun.</v>

1543
01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to Israel twice when my dad</v>

1544
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.873
<v Speaker 2>wasn't feeling well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the first time a stayed and Kinda </v>

1545
01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.043
<v Speaker 2>fucked it up on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So getting drunk and talking shit guys </v>

1546
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:25.560
<v Speaker 2>that it shouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1547
01:20:25.561 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 2>so then I rescheduled that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will call in from Israel.</v>

1548
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.250
<v Speaker 2>So that's the moment.</v>

1549
01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:34.493
<v Speaker 11>Hello.</v>

1550

<v Speaker 1>You think that I can handle myself </v>

1556
01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:03.870
<v Speaker 1>without a carer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You leave me in here.</v>

<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>

1625
01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.430
<v Speaker 11>I thought about asking him that </v>
<v Speaker 11>question,</v>

1626
01:24:08.431 --> 01:24:10.800
<v Speaker 11>but I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but</v>

1628
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:14.330
<v Speaker 6>I was reading that it just wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking funny.</v>

1629
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:19.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to shut this door now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What a professional.</v>

1630
01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:21.003
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know was so helplessly addicted to </v>

1631
01:24:23.301 --> 01:24:24.800
<v Speaker 6>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was insane.</v>

1632
01:24:24.801 --> 01:24:28.790
<v Speaker 6>Like if I ran out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would call this drug dealer.</v>

1633
01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:31.220
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was waiting for a call from him.</v>

1634
01:24:31.221 --> 01:24:32.054
<v Speaker 6>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

1635
01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:37.360
<v Speaker 6>using my cell phone as a pillow so that </v>
<v Speaker 6>when it vibrated,</v>

1636
01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:38.950
<v Speaker 6>Meghan would wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>be like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and new drugs.</v>

1638
01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:41.533
<v Speaker 6>Now if I went to a event,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I caught up the drug dealer and he </v>

1639
01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.073
<v Speaker 6>didn't answer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would just fucking show up at his </v>

1640
01:24:48.201 --> 01:24:49.790
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would just go there.</v>

1641
01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:50.673
<v Speaker 6>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ah.</v>

1642
01:24:50.690 --> 01:24:51.880
<v Speaker 6>When I got to his place,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our,</v>

1643
01:24:51.970 --> 01:24:52.803
<v Speaker 6>our Ed try the door.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes it was open and I would just </v>

1644
01:24:55.011 --> 01:24:58.820
<v Speaker 6>walk in and sometimes it wasn't open and</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was upsetting.</v>

1645
01:24:59.450 --> 01:25:01.250
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy,</v>

1646
01:25:01.251 --> 01:25:02.084
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This drug dealer wasn't just a drug </v>

1647
01:25:05.121 --> 01:25:05.360
<v Speaker 6>dealer.</v>

1648
01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.940
<v Speaker 6>He was also like a hardcore addict.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when I can,</v>

1649
01:25:07.941 --> 01:25:11.120
<v Speaker 6>and I'm talking about cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy would inject cocaine.</v>

1650
01:25:11.121 --> 01:25:14.990
<v Speaker 6>He would shoot up and for some reason </v>
<v Speaker 6>never injected anything.</v>

1651
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:18.350
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some reason that I just don't understand</v>

1652
01:25:18.650 --> 01:25:23.650
<v Speaker 6>about people who shoot up cocaine is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that with their syringe,</v>

1653
01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.430
<v Speaker 6>they scored their own blood all over the</v>
<v Speaker 6>planet.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'd find the guy like sitting there with</v>

1659
01:25:46.170 --> 01:25:47.003
<v Speaker 6>like literally needles fucking hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt like it was hanging out of his </v>

<v Speaker 6>neck one time.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He was in his back bedroom.</v>

1674
01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:30.200
<v Speaker 6>It was like a guest house kind of a deal</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it wasn't like an apartment,</v>

1675
01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:31.670

<v Speaker 6>it was like a guest house.</v>

1676
01:26:31.671 --> 01:26:35.220
<v Speaker 6>He went through the back of someone's </v>
<v Speaker 6>driveway and then he was,</v>

1677
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:38.600
<v Speaker 6>he was in the back and I walked in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he's in his bedroom,</v>

1678
01:26:38.601 --> 01:26:40.600
<v Speaker 6>in the back and like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>he was so he had been awake for so many </v>
<v Speaker 6>days that there's no fuck awakened this </v>

<v Speaker 6>to get them up.</v>

1690
01:27:03.141 --> 01:27:03.974
<v Speaker 6>So I went myself into his living room to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the table where he would weigh out all </v>

1691
01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:12.050

<v Speaker 6>there was just like a fucking residue of</v>

1694
01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:20.683
<v Speaker 6>coke has built up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm looking at it like I knew that </v>

<v Speaker 11>so I'm just sitting in that other room </v>

1731

<v Speaker 11>and my jaw was dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 11>This is telling the story.</v>

1732
01:29:24.811 --> 01:29:26.370
<v Speaker 11>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>is he fucking for real right now?</v>

01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:27.683
<v Speaker 11>So,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

1734
01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:29.120
<v Speaker 11>so that was pretty wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Launched.</v>

1735
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:34.080
<v Speaker 11>I watched the documentary but steevo </v>
<v Speaker 11>during those early years.</v>

1736
01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:35.580
<v Speaker 11>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he was wild.</v>

1737
01:29:35.610 --> 01:29:37.200
<v Speaker 11>He was not,</v>
<v Speaker 11>not well,</v>

1738
01:29:37.201 --> 01:29:38.230
<v Speaker 11>that was all serious.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

1739
01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:41.190
<v Speaker 11>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't doubt that at all.</v>

1740
01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:43.381
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So,</v>

1741
01:29:43.381 --> 01:29:45.800
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so that was definitely a,</v>

1742
01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:48.210
<v Speaker 11>a great early memory of working with.</v>

01:29:48.211 --> 01:29:50.100
<v Speaker 11>that was episode 12,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the podcast,</v>

1744
01:29:50.101 --> 01:29:52.580
<v Speaker 11>and I think I had come in on 11 so that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

1745
01:29:52.581 --> 01:29:53.414
<v Speaker 11>that was my second episode.</v>

1746
01:29:56.270 --> 01:30:01.270
<v Speaker 11>on the one end to the other right there.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So then actually my next uh,</v>

1747
01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.670
<v Speaker 11>was,</v>
<v Speaker 11>was also the Martin Shkreli thing.</v>

1748
01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.140
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so we've already,</v>

1749
01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:09.060
<v Speaker 11>we've already gone down that rabbit hole</v>
<v Speaker 11>a little bit.</v>

1750
01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:11.430
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what else do we got here?</v>

1751
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:13.570
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>all right.</v>

1753
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:19.910
<v Speaker 11>don't judge me is a little corny,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but this is not one of my favorites.</v>

1754
01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:21.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the podcast,</v>

1755
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:26.300
<v Speaker 5>I've got a little announcement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not really an announcement,</v>

1756
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:28.790
<v Speaker 5>just something I wanted to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just to give some context.</v>

1757
01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:32.490
<v Speaker 5>You guys didn't tell us either like </v>
<v Speaker 5>something was up,</v>

1758
01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:33.350
<v Speaker 5>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1759
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:35.930
<v Speaker 5>I found out the same time as all of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1760
01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:37.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this was a pretty special moment,</v>

1761
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:41.480
<v Speaker 5>but it may be that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And also the delivery is hilarious.</v>

1762
01:30:42.010 --> 01:30:46.850
<v Speaker 5>There's a new thing of the thickening </v>

<v Speaker 5>What I'm trying to say is that Isla </v>

1764
01:30:50.751 --> 01:30:51.584
<v Speaker 5>won't be drinking alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if she's responsible what I'm trying </v>

1765
01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:01.320
<v Speaker 5>to say.</v>

<v Speaker 4>uttered on this podcast.</v>

1801
01:32:58.630 --> 01:33:00.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it'll ever be topped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honestly.</v>

1802
01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:02.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm curious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>

1803
01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:09.490
<v Speaker 4>So 39 with post Malone looks so </v>
<v Speaker 4>exhausting.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I guess that means you are more than </v>

1813
01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:33.790
<v Speaker 4>just a gun because I didn't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really just the guy.</v>

1814
01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:38.320
<v Speaker 4>Your eyes look like hamburgers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's so fucking funny.</v>

1816
01:33:41.670 --> 01:33:45.770
<v Speaker 4>But I think of that regular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a very original line.</v>

1817
01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:52.200

1819
01:33:55.110 --> 01:34:00.110
<v Speaker 4>That Tom Petty Song write a brown eyed </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl than Morrison.</v>

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.660
<v Speaker 4>that was quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm right on that.</v>

1822
01:34:04.661 --> 01:34:08.500
<v Speaker 4>But famously a post malone as a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>track coming out on his new album called</v>

1823
01:34:08.501 --> 01:34:11.940
<v Speaker 4>hamburger.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Congrats.</v>

1825
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:15.731
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1826
01:34:15.731 --> 01:34:16.780
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1827
01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:21.310
<v Speaker 4>and then I just have one worst moment </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I need to put up there.</v>

1828
01:34:21.370 --> 01:34:24.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm legitimately still have nightmares </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>

1829
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:26.560
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a joke.</v>

1830
01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:32.590
<v Speaker 4>I'll have like stress nightmares about </v>
<v Speaker 4>work and we are streaming.</v>

1831
01:34:34.050 --> 01:34:34.883
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was our first on youtube on </v>

1832
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:40.843
<v Speaker 4>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come over and see what it feels like </v>

1833
01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:47.290
<v Speaker 4>because we've never actually watched </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the show.</v>

1834
01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:52.300
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought it'd be a fun </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience to see that one point.</v>

1835
01:34:54.251 --> 01:34:57.890
<v Speaker 4>2 million views on today's episode.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe people watch this.</v>

1836
01:34:58.810 --> 01:35:01.780
<v Speaker 5>It keeps me going for like over a </v>
<v Speaker 5>minute.</v>

1837
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:02.803
<v Speaker 5>Isla,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are looking good and Dan is </v>

1838
01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.590
<v Speaker 5>screaming at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't hear him on twitch.</v>

1839
01:35:16.090 --> 01:35:21.090
<v Speaker 5>You can do appreciate working here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I know I'm in this little minor</v>

1840
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:30.770
<v Speaker 5>escape that I never want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened,</v>

1841
01:35:31.130 --> 01:35:32.540
<v Speaker 5>which made this so great,</v>

1842
01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:35.960
<v Speaker 4>is that it was our first live episode on</v>
<v Speaker 4>Youtube,</v>

1843
01:35:35.961 --> 01:35:38.810
<v Speaker 4>which means that because we were live </v>
<v Speaker 4>streaming on twitch,</v>

1844
01:35:38.811 --> 01:35:41.660
<v Speaker 4>so if we had a mistake like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could just start over.</v>

1845
01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.130
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then cut it up.</v>

1846
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:44.533
<v Speaker 4>So this was the first time that it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you got to actually nail this </v>

1847
01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.350
<v Speaker 4>live and I think part of it too is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1848
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:53.000
<v Speaker 4>I usually double check all the computers</v>
<v Speaker 4>and would check for this kind of stuff,</v>

1849
01:35:53.001 --> 01:35:56.000
<v Speaker 4>but because it was the first time on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Youtube I had a million new,</v>

1850
01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:56.893
<v Speaker 4>like it wasn't routine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was the first day of the new </v>

1851
01:35:59.211 --> 01:36:00.044
<v Speaker 4>setup and so my mind was a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>places and didn't see that you had </v>

1852
01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:07.310
<v Speaker 4>stream open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoops.</v>

1853
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:08.840
<v Speaker 4>Hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got one point,</v>

1854
01:36:08.841 --> 01:36:09.930
<v Speaker 4>2 million views.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1855
01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:10.773
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somehow people powered through that </v>

1856
01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:13.453
<v Speaker 4>makes me feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At one point 2 million people have seen </v>

1857
01:36:16.071 --> 01:36:20.150
<v Speaker 4>me feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I give to hard on yourself then.</v>

1858
01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:21.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you know,</v>

1859
01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:26.480
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you have an anxiety attack</v>

1860
01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:27.700
<v Speaker 4>on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1861
01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.500
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a disaster.</v>

1862
01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:35.450
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like an anxiety attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then after that episode we go and we see</v>

1863
01:36:35.451 --> 01:36:36.590
<v Speaker 4>how bad is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1864
01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:37.130
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like,</v>

1865
01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how bad could it be?</v>

1866
01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:43.640
<v Speaker 4>And it keeps going and it keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys,</v>

1867
01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.310
<v Speaker 4>when I told you I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were like,</v>

1868
01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:48.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after the episode it was like,</v>

1869
01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:49.610
<v Speaker 4>hello,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how bad is it?</v>

1870
01:36:49.611 --> 01:36:54.090
<v Speaker 4>And it was like pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1871
01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:57.050
<v Speaker 4>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny in retrospect as to I guess,</v>

1872
01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:58.640
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1873
01:36:58.641 --> 01:36:59.474
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll sometimes have like just this past </v>

1874
01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:03.020
<v Speaker 4>week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1875
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:04.700
<v Speaker 4>it was the night before the charity </v>
<v Speaker 4>stream.</v>

1876
01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:06.440
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't dream about that,</v>

1877
01:37:06.441 --> 01:37:07.274
<v Speaker 4>but I had a dream that our audio board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the settings got erased like five </v>

1878
01:37:10.581 --> 01:37:11.414
<v Speaker 4>minutes at a horse show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which anybody that's done audio would </v>

1879
01:37:14.181 --> 01:37:16.250
<v Speaker 4>know that that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1880
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:20.270
<v Speaker 4>two hours of reset that would need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

1881
01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:24.080
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm glad to know you're having </v>
<v Speaker 4>nightmares about what it means.</v>

<v Speaker 4>memories.</v>

1893
01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:02.123
<v Speaker 12>Gotcha.</v>

1894
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:13.310
<v Speaker 4>Dead Air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this one was Dan.</v>

1895
01:38:16.481 --> 01:38:19.150
<v Speaker 4>Let's listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Early on when I started working here.</v>

1896
01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:24.250
<v Speaker 4>And this moment I think took us all </v>
<v Speaker 4>caught us all by surprise.</v>

1897
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Bradbury showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

1898
01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.310
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is this clip?</v>

1899
01:38:30.311 --> 01:38:33.370
<v Speaker 4>But only it's 2000 views.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is way early on the channel.</v>

1900
01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:36.660
<v Speaker 4>The highlight channels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the first no videos,</v>

1901
01:38:36.930 --> 01:38:39.070
<v Speaker 4>that highlight channel is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>the lowest by the way.</v>

1902
01:38:39.071 --> 01:38:40.930
<v Speaker 4>Highlight channel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just hit a million subscribers.</v>

1903
01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:46.553
<v Speaker 4>That is so cool because we all created </v>
<v Speaker 4>that highlight channel together less </v>

1904
01:38:50.111 --> 01:38:54.290
<v Speaker 4>than a year ago because people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>stealing our clips and posting it,</v>

1905
01:38:54.291 --> 01:38:55.660
<v Speaker 4>sort of like what the hell we should do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1906
01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.530
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1907
01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:58.593
<v Speaker 4>the explosion there has been phenomenal </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's so cool that we've all built </v>

1908
01:39:02.351 --> 01:39:03.184
<v Speaker 4>that together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys were all here from the </v>

1909
01:39:05.261 --> 01:39:09.850
<v Speaker 4>inception of that channel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually cut it,</v>

1910
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:14.580
<v Speaker 4>cut the highlights and low 75 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1911
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:16.383

<v Speaker 4>He is the highlight king and I handled </v>

1912
01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.600
<v Speaker 4>some of the slick thumbnails now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thumbnails had been fired lately.</v>

1913
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:27.280
<v Speaker 4>Our thumbnail game has been improving.</v>

<v Speaker 4>subscribed.</v>

<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1963

<v Speaker 4>number and then left us includes you.</v>

1964
01:41:58.430 --> 01:42:00.310
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird to say,</v>

1965
01:42:00.311 --> 01:42:02.050
<v Speaker 4>I really like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't mean to say that.</v>

1966
01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:06.370
<v Speaker 4>Do people really like themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't love yourself.</v>

1967
01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:08.440
<v Speaker 4>I know people say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1968
01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:10.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird to be like say,</v>

1969
01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.580
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Regardless.</v>

1970
01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.520
<v Speaker 4>He hit us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit us with them names.</v>

1971
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:19.833
<v Speaker 4>I remember we were all panicking on this</v>
<v Speaker 4>one because we had no idea what was </v>

1972
01:42:24.341 --> 01:42:25.390
<v Speaker 4>going to walk through the door.</v>

1973
01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.233
<v Speaker 4>If Ethan Bradbury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to just be like completely </v>

1974
01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:30.063
<v Speaker 4>quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to engage and then they </v>

1975
01:42:32.861 --> 01:42:33.694
<v Speaker 4>turned out to be just absolute legends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a little back story actually </v>

1976
01:42:38.681 --> 01:42:43.681
<v Speaker 4>because we didn't know what to expect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1977
01:42:44.110 --> 01:42:46.480
<v Speaker 4>somebody rolled outside to greet them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it un?</v>

1978
01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:47.770
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't me.</v>

1979
01:42:48.010 --> 01:42:50.710
<v Speaker 4>I think we saw out the window actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

1980
01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:53.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you could see where </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody went outside.</v>

1981
01:42:53.021 --> 01:42:54.670
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe it was me,</v>

1982
01:42:54.850 --> 01:42:56.290
<v Speaker 4>it was me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was definitely me.</v>

1983
01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:57.513
<v Speaker 4>I went out to go meet them and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in the parking lot putting on the </v>

1984
01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:03.340
<v Speaker 4>spiderman that's and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

1985
01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:08.200
<v Speaker 4>I came inside and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1986
01:43:08.201 --> 01:43:10.680
<v Speaker 4>you guys are going to remember this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1987
01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:15.750
<v Speaker 4>I remember like we bought donuts before </v>
<v Speaker 4>and make it their own.</v>

1988
01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:16.820
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>

1989
01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:20.080
<v Speaker 4>They knew what was up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They came to play,</v>

1990
01:43:20.081 --> 01:43:24.220
<v Speaker 4>so we rolled out the carpet form here.</v>

1991
01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:30.490
<v Speaker 4>I think the only guest that ever got the</v>
<v Speaker 4>red carpet treatment,</v>

1992
01:43:32.110 --> 01:43:33.610
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

1993
01:43:33.611 --> 01:43:38.560
<v Speaker 4>I love the exact shot into the office or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1994
01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:46.273
<v Speaker 4>Kinda played the kids music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were all obsessed with ethan trap </v>

1995
01:43:55.361 --> 01:43:56.810
<v Speaker 4>area as I still am.</v>

<v Speaker 4>does his own thing.</v>

1997
01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:09.280
<v Speaker 4>I was afraid that I was afraid that </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's going to lay on the couch and it's</v>

1998
01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:13.953
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that was just a fun.</v>

2047
01:47:03.690 --> 01:47:07.020
<v Speaker 4>That was one of my favorite episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was just so entertaining.</v>

2048
01:47:07.090 --> 01:47:07.923
<v Speaker 4>I was so nervous about interviewing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's so deep in character that </v>

2049
01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:14.340
<v Speaker 4>it was just.</v>

2050
01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:15.493
<v Speaker 4>I was afraid was gonna be a minefield of</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to get him to say anything </v>

2051
01:47:18.331 --> 01:47:19.810
<v Speaker 4>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he actually,</v>

2052
01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:20.600
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2053
01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.850
<v Speaker 4>he did great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he never broke character but,</v>

2054
01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:27.690
<v Speaker 4>but he still managed to be kind of real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Lens of the character.</v>

2055
01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:28.524
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was good.</v>

2056
01:47:28.570 --> 01:47:29.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I enjoyed that.</v>

2057
01:47:29.431 --> 01:47:30.264
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2058
01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:31.753
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so another one that I had was when we </v>

2059
01:47:33.601 --> 01:47:35.680
<v Speaker 4>had sean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sean Evans,</v>

2060
01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:40.780
<v Speaker 4>first gotTa chew you gotTa fucking beard</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everything.</v>

2061
01:47:41.410 --> 01:47:43.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I saw this I was like,</v>

2062
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.780
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You and Alex were getting creamed in the</v>

2063
01:47:48.781 --> 01:47:50.460
<v Speaker 4>background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2064
01:47:50.461 --> 01:47:51.294
<v Speaker 4>it was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was not anticipating while I was at </v>

2065
01:47:53.341 --> 01:47:55.740
<v Speaker 4>the time because you now like spicy food</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of this.</v>

2066
01:47:55.741 --> 01:47:56.250
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

2067
01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:58.860
<v Speaker 4>this kinda like broke the seal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember it was,</v>

2068
01:47:58.890 --> 01:47:59.723
<v Speaker 4>we knew this about Ian that he like </v>
<v Speaker 4>never ate spicy food and then we forced </v>

2069
01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:05.220
<v Speaker 4>like a hot cheeto would knocked me on my</v>
<v Speaker 4>end.</v>

2070
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:06.810
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was a big jump,</v>

2071
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:11.830
<v Speaker 4>but this was so fun because the taste is</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of pleasant at first.</v>

2072
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:23.610
<v Speaker 4>It feels like I was teabag by Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like you were to back,</v>

2073
01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:28.620
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you filling out crying?</v>

2074
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:33.240
<v Speaker 4>I was dying back there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was rough.</v>

2075
01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.353
<v Speaker 4>I was so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of my favorite episodes </v>

2076
01:48:37.351 --> 01:48:40.410
<v Speaker 4>because we have always been such fans of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hotlines.</v>

2077
01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:41.653
<v Speaker 4>And then to get actually got to pick his</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain a little bit on how he interviews </v>

2078
01:48:45.331 --> 01:48:47.120
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2079
01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:48.893
<v Speaker 4>that was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the first time I showed my face </v>

2080
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.750
<v Speaker 4>on the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had the meme where we never saw your.</v>

2081
01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:00.900
<v Speaker 4>Although we didn't really never shut </v>
<v Speaker 4>like we've shown blown at once before.</v>

2082
01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:05.390
<v Speaker 4>I think the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or it was made by Joey Salad,</v>

2083
01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:09.780
<v Speaker 4>a joey in his blog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He showed somebody on the subway.</v>

2084
01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:12.280
<v Speaker 4>I was such an ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me.</v>

2085
01:49:12.330 --> 01:49:13.163
<v Speaker 4>I almost don't even remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you're eating the powerpoint is the </v>

2086
01:49:17.191 --> 01:49:18.024
<v Speaker 4>pace of the show at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically we gave everyone had to deal </v>

2087
01:49:21.601 --> 01:49:25.110
<v Speaker 4>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2088
01:49:25.111 --> 01:49:26.400
<v Speaker 4>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was great.</v>

2089
01:49:26.610 --> 01:49:28.170
<v Speaker 4>Doing a little mini hartland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2090
01:49:28.171 --> 01:49:33.171
<v Speaker 4>that was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another I liked when Eric brought on his</v>

2091
01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:38.150
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy closet segment broker clip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>

2092
01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:39.090
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>love.</v>

2093
01:49:39.091 --> 01:49:44.091
<v Speaker 4>Love this real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So keep an eye on now.</v>

2094
01:49:44.861 --> 01:49:46.500
<v Speaker 4>This guy's a clone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's about the glitch,</v>

2095
01:49:46.501 --> 01:49:47.380
<v Speaker 4>the fuck out.</v>

2096
01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:54.310
<v Speaker 5>A certain amount of distance between the</v>
<v Speaker 5>two on the right might also be clones.</v>

2097
01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.173
<v Speaker 5>There is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big day or do the strangest </v>

2098
01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:05.080
<v Speaker 5>things on his.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On the history of what is happening.</v>

2099
01:50:05.150 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 5>If you could say there's a pretty big </v>
<v Speaker 5>weight go</v>

2100
01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:21.800
<v Speaker 4>because she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's such a weird face that it's not</v>

2101
01:50:21.801 --> 01:50:23.930
<v Speaker 4>a natural relaxed look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:26.840
<v Speaker 4>It's so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it does seem like somebody said like</v>

2103
01:50:26.841 --> 01:50:30.070
<v Speaker 4>his trigger word and he went into debug </v>
<v Speaker 4>mode from them.</v>

2104
01:50:31.050 --> 01:50:33.080
<v Speaker 4>I think the second off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>

2105
01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:35.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they intro.</v>

2106
01:50:35.110 --> 01:50:36.410
<v Speaker 4>This segment is just so great.</v>

2107
01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:42.000
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2108
01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:48.740
<v Speaker 4>Whether we should get another episode </v>
<v Speaker 4>going of ABC's until.</v>

2109
01:50:50.190 --> 01:50:51.480
<v Speaker 4>That would be fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2110
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Eric is always a blast to avalon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2111
01:50:53.431 --> 01:50:54.264
<v Speaker 4>he's a great president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's time to reboot the conspiracy </v>

2112
01:50:56.521 --> 01:50:57.370
<v Speaker 4>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2113
01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:59.020
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know it meant that much to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2114
01:50:59.070 --> 01:50:59.903
<v Speaker 4>but know to this day people constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll see comments like please bring </v>

2115
01:51:07.591 --> 01:51:08.580
<v Speaker 4>it back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so good.</v>

2116
01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:09.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should.</v>

2117
01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:11.880
<v Speaker 4>I really love how he prepared a segment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2118
01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:14.860
<v Speaker 4>it really worked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2119
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:17.520
<v Speaker 4>this was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another squirelly one,</v>

2120
01:51:17.521 --> 01:51:20.490
<v Speaker 4>but this was just to show the live </v>
<v Speaker 4>episode we did,</v>

2121
01:51:20.491 --> 01:51:24.750
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was one of the funniest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most enjoyable ones we've done,</v>

2122
01:51:24.751 --> 01:51:26.400
<v Speaker 4>but also extremely stressful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2123
01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:27.690
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys,</v>

2124
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:30.480
<v Speaker 4>you guys in the crew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was,</v>

2125
01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:33.540
<v Speaker 4>it took so much work and you guys were </v>
<v Speaker 4>grinding hard.</v>

2126
01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:34.513
<v Speaker 4>It was all of that together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had extra because it wasn't just do </v>

2127
01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:38.613
<v Speaker 4>the live show is also streaming it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recording it all the first time ever </v>

2128
01:51:42.601 --> 01:51:45.840
<v Speaker 4>doing it out of our studio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I've done a lot to promote events.</v>

2129
01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.180
<v Speaker 4>So that was my job before I came and </v>
<v Speaker 4>worked for you guys.</v>

2130
01:51:48.181 --> 01:51:53.010
<v Speaker 4>But it had been awhile and I was used to</v>
<v Speaker 4>working with like a production truck and</v>

2131
01:51:53.011 --> 01:51:53.850
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2132
01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:55.380
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2133
01:51:55.381 --> 01:51:56.214
<v Speaker 4>but we pulled it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe get closely with them on any </v>

2134
01:51:58.471 --> 01:51:59.310
<v Speaker 4>hitches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

2135
01:51:59.370 --> 01:52:04.370
<v Speaker 4>I will say the projector was a pain in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the audio was fucking out of it.</v>

2136
01:52:06.370 --> 01:52:07.203
<v Speaker 4>We're kind of Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you guys have a $50 fucking </v>

2137
01:52:10.801 --> 01:52:15.801
<v Speaker 4>projector?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just barely got time on the stage to get</v>

2138
01:52:15.961 --> 01:52:19.200
<v Speaker 4>used to it now where before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's all right.</v>

2139
01:52:19.290 --> 01:52:21.740
<v Speaker 4>We got kicked out of the venue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2140
01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:22.853
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were some circumstances that made </v>

2141
01:52:24.961 --> 01:52:26.040
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the most part,</v>

2142
01:52:26.050 --> 01:52:26.883
<v Speaker 4>it was as smooth as you could hope for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Zach was calling in as Jordan the </v>

2143
01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:32.810
<v Speaker 4>fanboy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2144
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:35.870
<v Speaker 4>And he was coming the projector.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2145
01:52:35.890 --> 01:52:37.870
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very much.</v>

2146
01:52:38.630 --> 01:52:39.960
<v Speaker 4>Now I have nightmares about that one </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

2147
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:43.170
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't in control because we tested it</v>
<v Speaker 4>beforehand.</v>

2148
01:52:43.171 --> 01:52:43.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2149
01:52:43.890 --> 01:52:46.410
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's only so much you can do a.</v>

2150
01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:48.860
<v Speaker 4>It was a such a fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such a fun,</v>

2151
01:52:48.861 --> 01:52:52.010
<v Speaker 4>fun time and so stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just too stressful.</v>

2152
01:52:52.011 --> 01:52:53.840
<v Speaker 4>That's what we haven't done it again </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we were like,</v>

2153
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:55.820
<v Speaker 4>that was amazing and I never want to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it again.</v>

2154
01:52:56.410 --> 01:52:58.820
<v Speaker 4>Kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did one and do it again,</v>

2155
01:52:58.910 --> 01:53:00.050
<v Speaker 4>but we don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

2156
01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:01.253
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We even had the idea of doing it once a </v>

2157
01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:05.040
<v Speaker 4>month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2158
01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:07.200
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2159
01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:08.593
<v Speaker 4>Doing it as kind of a residency thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if we were maybe something </v>

2160
01:53:11.391 --> 01:53:12.224
<v Speaker 4>considering the future because if we do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it regularly then it becomes less of a </v>

2161
01:53:16.431 --> 01:53:17.264
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2162
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:18.163
<v Speaker 4>you got a routine on how you do it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get into a rhythm and it's not so </v>

2163
01:53:20.811 --> 01:53:21.110
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>

2164
01:53:21.110 --> 01:53:24.080
<v Speaker 4>So maybe someday in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was so fun.</v>

2165
01:53:24.081 --> 01:53:24.914
<v Speaker 4>It really was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all went out afterwards this out and </v>

2166
01:53:27.561 --> 01:53:29.090
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was super fun.</v>

2167
01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:31.370
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2168
01:53:31.530 --> 01:53:33.860
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing is like in the room that there</v>

2169
01:53:33.861 --> 01:53:37.310
<v Speaker 4>was so much laughter and joy in the room</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone,</v>

2170
01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:38.173
<v Speaker 4>there were some really great energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you watch the vod you don't </v>

2171
01:53:40.341 --> 01:53:41.174
<v Speaker 4>really get to feel that because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't hear the laughs and the crowd as </v>

2172
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:47.720
<v Speaker 4>much as we did in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which that was another aspect is we,</v>

2173
01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:52.160
<v Speaker 4>the venue did the audio and not that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they did a terrible job,</v>

2174
01:53:52.161 --> 01:53:55.730
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't necessarily have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>audience mics.</v>

2175
01:53:56.150 --> 01:53:57.160
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2176
01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:00.350
<v Speaker 4>if we were to do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lesson learned like the Mike,</v>

2177
01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:01.790
<v Speaker 4>we should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should.</v>

2178
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:04.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we'll do another one next year.</v>

2179
01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:05.330
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2180
01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:09.690
<v Speaker 4>and there was a proposal of marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what,</v>

2181
01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:11.480
<v Speaker 4>we buy them again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went.</v>

2182
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:14.240
<v Speaker 4>When we did kill Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were in the audience.</v>

2183
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.930
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no way.</v>

2184
01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:16.160
<v Speaker 4>And they came and said Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>

2185
01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:19.490
<v Speaker 4>you guys are married now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>

2186
01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:22.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trying to find the moment,</v>

2187

<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was out.</v>

2247
01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:46.940
<v Speaker 4>It took me out of the closet.</v>

01:58:51.910 --> 01:58:55.000
<v Speaker 4>point of conversation to note like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I guess so.</v>

2253
01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:07.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm always like a rat in the community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was banned from the floor.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2257
01:59:18.410 --> 01:59:21.160
<v Speaker 4>What you're wearing right now as a </v>

2262
01:59:32.131 --> 01:59:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Let me riff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me rephrase.</v>

2263
01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:34.493
<v Speaker 1>They said we want to give you guys the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eecs who's up first and I said it's got </v>

<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

2265
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:45.330

<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>

2266
01:59:45.390 --> 01:59:48.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was difficult.</v>

2267
01:59:48.781 --> 01:59:52.170
<v Speaker 4>But we did get a pair and I am very </v>
<v Speaker 4>grateful for that.</v>

2268
01:59:52.171 --> 01:59:54.360
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let me ask you this,</v>

2269
01:59:54.630 --> 01:59:55.463
<v Speaker 4>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you happy that I added you or would </v>

2270

<v Speaker 4>you prefer to go back and erase that </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well either way I have yeezys like where</v>

<v Speaker 4>So it's a win win,</v>

2273
02:00:08.370 --> 02:00:10.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a zero sum game,</v>

2274
02:00:11.010 --> 02:00:13.830
<v Speaker 4>but I guess I have real ones now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had real ones,</v>

2275
02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:16.390
<v Speaker 1>but they're not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>

2276
02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Are the real ones more comfortable than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fake ones?</v>

2277
02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:22.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's different material,</v>

2278
02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>but how does it compare because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got fake think are pretty comfy.</v>

2279
02:00:27.230 --> 02:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're,</v>

2280
02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:30.153
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're comfier than the fake ones for </v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm convinced now that his shoes are </v>

2285

<v Speaker 4>more available than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm from paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California and most of my family friends</v>

2318
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:21.000

<v Speaker 1>I just want to say thank you for doing </v>

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>And then she goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2322
02:02:28.921 --> 02:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>and one more thing you guys should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys talked about,</v>

2323
02:02:32.210 --> 02:02:33.043
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one more thing you guys talked about </v>

2324
02:02:36.721 --> 02:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>what you would take if you had a chance </v>
<v Speaker 1>to evacuate and most of you said dog,</v>

2325
02:02:41.011 --> 02:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>of course the media has given backlash </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards people leaving their pets,</v>

2326
02:02:44.821 --> 02:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>which on paper I would have to.</v>

2327
02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>The truth is when the fire head </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise,</v>

2328
02:02:49.261 --> 02:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>it was around 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM,</v>

2329
02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>8:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM,</v>

2330
02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:52.853
<v Speaker 1>so by that time most people had already </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone to work or school and drop their </v>

2331
02:02:56.221 --> 02:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>kids off at school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradise being a small town,</v>

2332
02:02:59.071 --> 02:02:59.904
<v Speaker 1>most people don't work in paradise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mute out of town and the surrounding </v>

2333
02:03:03.151 --> 02:03:04.890
<v Speaker 1>cities like chico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red bluff reading,</v>

2334
02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:05.743
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the fire hit paradise and when </v>

2335
02:03:07.561 --> 02:03:08.394
<v Speaker 1>it did hit it very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people did not even have the time to go </v>

2336
02:03:11.311 --> 02:03:15.270
<v Speaker 1>back to paradise to get their pets or </v>
<v Speaker 1>any personal belongings because it was,</v>

2337
02:03:15.730 --> 02:03:19.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to share this with you guys and</v>

2338
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:23.760
<v Speaker 1>that does actually explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2339
02:03:23.761 --> 02:03:27.090
<v Speaker 1>thanks for being awesome people and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always looking forward to the show.</v>

2340
02:03:27.091 --> 02:03:27.924
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much jay dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that actually puts it even more in </v>

2341
02:03:30.301 --> 02:03:33.240
<v Speaker 1>perspective because you go off to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>or school,</v>

2342
02:03:33.570 --> 02:03:38.250
<v Speaker 1>you don't even have a chance to get not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only your pet but any of your belongings</v>

2343
02:03:39.570 --> 02:03:40.403
<v Speaker 1>be so devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I couldn'T go take care of shredder </v>

2344
02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:45.810
<v Speaker 1>and you know that something's up</v>

2345
02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:50.980
<v Speaker 9>that makes art because I feel like a lot</v>
<v Speaker 9>of the videos I watched were people were</v>

2346
02:03:50.981 --> 02:03:54.910
<v Speaker 9>trying to drive back into it was because</v>
<v Speaker 9>of their pets and I did wonder that.</v>

2347
02:03:54.911 --> 02:03:55.744
<v Speaker 9>So yeah,</v>

2348
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so heart wrenching.</v>

2349
02:03:58.931 --> 02:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Like to not to feel helpless like </v>
<v Speaker 1>shredders in the house.</v>

2350
02:04:02.651 --> 02:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't know if it's on fire.</v>

2351
02:04:04.661 --> 02:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>

2352
02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I would run into the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's what some people will try</v>

2353
02:04:09.201 --> 02:04:10.034
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just like such a betrayal </v>

2354
02:04:11.591 --> 02:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>and your poor pet is at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scared,</v>

2355
02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:17.770

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I,</v>

2459
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:36.060
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

2460
02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>as a audience member of the podcast,</v>

2461
02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:42.060
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you guys pretty much covered a lot.</v>

2462
02:09:44.410 --> 02:09:46.650
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the ricky ticky tack,</v>

2463
02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:52.430
<v Speaker 13>he was calling the church and he was </v>
<v Speaker 13>going crazy with the boys.</v>

2464
02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:53.100
<v Speaker 13>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 13>whoa,</v>

2465
02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:53.570
<v Speaker 13>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 13>whoa,</v>

2466
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:54.750
<v Speaker 13>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 13>calm down.</v>

2467
02:09:55.210 --> 02:09:57.290
<v Speaker 13>Like I didn't think that he would take </v>
<v Speaker 13>it that far.</v>

2468
02:09:57.291 --> 02:09:58.710
<v Speaker 13>I think it was like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

2469
02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:00.240
<v Speaker 13>goof.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And then he Just stopped.</v>

2470
02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:02.190
<v Speaker 13>He just kept on going and I really love </v>
<v Speaker 13>it.</v>

2471
02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:03.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked watching that back today </v>

2472
02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:08.480
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy that call was that later?</v>

2473
02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:10.060
<v Speaker 13>No,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it was just really awesome.</v>

2474
02:10:10.061 --> 02:10:12.040
<v Speaker 13>Like I really like,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the thing is,</v>

2475
02:10:12.041 --> 02:10:15.100
<v Speaker 13>is that what I love about the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 13>itself is that,</v>

2476
02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:18.520
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you guys have this kind of formula going</v>

2477
02:10:18.521 --> 02:10:21.340
<v Speaker 13>on,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but you diversify in a way that you have</v>

2478
02:10:21.341 --> 02:10:25.210
<v Speaker 13>always these new elements coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So you have ruined in a couple of times.</v>

2479
02:10:25.211 --> 02:10:26.044
<v Speaker 13>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 13>But every time he comes in there's </v>

2480
02:10:27.011 --> 02:10:29.440
<v Speaker 13>something new added to the mix,</v>
<v Speaker 13>like new elements,</v>

2481
02:10:29.530 --> 02:10:32.140
<v Speaker 13>which is something as an audience member</v>
<v Speaker 13>like,</v>

2482
02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:32.990
<v Speaker 13>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>we shit,</v>

2483
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 13>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Damn,</v>

2484
02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:36.990
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome to hear you work hard.</v>

2485
02:10:36.991 --> 02:10:38.360
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes doesn't.</v>

2486
02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not easy to spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've,</v>

2487
02:10:42.170 --> 02:10:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean we try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we work hard on the,</v>

2488
02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:47.060
<v Speaker 1>on the show and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm glad to hear that,</v>

2489
02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:51.010
<v Speaker 1>that you appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're working hard.</v>

2490
02:10:51.290 --> 02:10:52.910
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that um,</v>

2491
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:56.690
<v Speaker 1>when we come back for like one slash one</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus the new season,</v>

2492
02:10:56.691 --> 02:10:57.524
<v Speaker 1>I want to call it in a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to redo a lot of things and kind </v>

2493
02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:04.250
<v Speaker 1>of reimagine what we do here and freshen</v>
<v Speaker 1>it up a lot.</v>

2494
02:11:04.251 --> 02:11:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I've got some fun ideas and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well one thing we talked.</v>

2495
02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you got for me?</v>

2496
02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:13.580
<v Speaker 13>No,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it was just asking you about like,</v>

2497
02:11:13.590 --> 02:11:15.110
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>cause you have two channels,</v>

2498
02:11:15.111 --> 02:11:17.840
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>
<v Speaker 13>So you got a little bit of the criticism</v>

2499
02:11:17.841 --> 02:11:20.960
<v Speaker 13>about kind of like how you're balancing </v>
<v Speaker 13>up the channels and everything.</v>

2500
02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:22.610
<v Speaker 13>I don't only need to get into it too </v>
<v Speaker 13>much,</v>

2501
02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:26.090
<v Speaker 13>but like you're putting a lot of effort </v>
<v Speaker 13>into the podcast,</v>

2502
02:11:26.091 --> 02:11:26.924
<v Speaker 13>whIch is awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but like how would you balance out that </v>

2503
02:11:28.971 --> 02:11:31.940
<v Speaker 13>effort with the main channel vh date?</v>
<v Speaker 13>She productions.</v>

2504
02:11:32.610 --> 02:11:33.443
<v Speaker 1>So I think a misconception that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have is that my lack of uploads on h </v>

2505
02:11:39.821 --> 02:11:44.500
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>h three was due to me focusing my energy</v>

2506
02:11:44.501 --> 02:11:49.501
<v Speaker 1>to the podcast when the truth of why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't posting there had wasn't an issue</v>

2507
02:11:50.921 --> 02:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>of time or commitment or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2508
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:55.143
<v Speaker 1>It was really a result of not knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do there or not feeling like I </v>

2509
02:11:59.351 --> 02:12:00.184
<v Speaker 1>was in the right head space or having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of motivation or just a lot of </v>

2510
02:12:03.851 --> 02:12:06.520
<v Speaker 1>negative bad feelings around posting </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2511
02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:09.220
<v Speaker 1>So for me it's a lot of people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2512
02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:10.113
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stopped posting there because the </v>

2513
02:12:11.831 --> 02:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>podcast is more lucrative and he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about his fans or whatever.</v>

2514
02:12:14.951 --> 02:12:15.784
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of people always want to see </v>

2515
02:12:17.021 --> 02:12:20.050
<v Speaker 1>the worst in it and like just assume the</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst about people.</v>

2516
02:12:20.350 --> 02:12:21.183
<v Speaker 1>But the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one that I'm addressing now as best </v>

2517
02:12:23.891 --> 02:12:26.770
<v Speaker 1>as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I,</v>

2518
02:12:27.020 --> 02:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I am and was depressed.</v>

2519
02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm doing much better now I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

2520
02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:32.653
<v Speaker 1>and something that I'm working on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a lot of anxiety and a lot of </v>

2521
02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:38.530
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2522
02:12:39.130 --> 02:12:44.130
<v Speaker 1>that I needed to resolve and a lot of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was manifesting itself through how I did</v>

2523
02:12:44.861 --> 02:12:48.640
<v Speaker 1>my work there in my primary source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment.</v>

2524
02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:53.880
<v Speaker 1>And so the podcast was honestly a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to not disappear.</v>

2525
02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:01.080
<v Speaker 1>It was a way for me to stay present and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to still be working and to still share,</v>

2526
02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:03.333
<v Speaker 1>share my life and be with our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the people that want that want to </v>

2527
02:13:07.031 --> 02:13:07.864
<v Speaker 1>continue to watch us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me the podcast was something to </v>

2528
02:13:11.591 --> 02:13:12.424
<v Speaker 1>do while I sorted that shit out and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been an incredible resource for me to </v>

2529
02:13:19.931 --> 02:13:23.380
<v Speaker 1>come here and be able to share my </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and to not just disappear,</v>

2530
02:13:23.381 --> 02:13:24.214
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's not something I ever </v>

2531
02:13:25.751 --> 02:13:27.850
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

2532
02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:28.893
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's a misconception </v>

2533
02:13:30.130 --> 02:13:30.963
<v Speaker 1>because now we're back posting videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and we're doing both and it's </v>

2534
02:13:33.421 --> 02:13:34.980
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're busier,</v>

2535
02:13:34.981 --> 02:13:35.814
<v Speaker 1>but it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like being busy and I like feeling </v>

2536
02:13:37.111 --> 02:13:37.944
<v Speaker 1>productive and</v>

2537
02:13:37.970 --> 02:13:38.803
<v Speaker 13>well I really appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I think mental health is something </v>

2538
02:13:41.311 --> 02:13:45.300
<v Speaker 13>that's really not addressed a lot in the</v>
<v Speaker 13>media and the way that it is addressed.</v>

2539
02:13:45.301 --> 02:13:47.450
<v Speaker 13>That feels a little bit underplayed.</v>
<v Speaker 13>A,</v>

2540
02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:51.360
<v Speaker 13>it almost seems as if it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 13>a capital brand capitalists brand.</v>

2541
02:13:51.361 --> 02:13:53.700
<v Speaker 13>It's almost like something with the </v>
<v Speaker 13>better health situation.</v>

2542
02:13:53.701 --> 02:13:55.560
<v Speaker 13>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I'm not going to pick it up again,</v>

2543
02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:56.693
<v Speaker 13>but the thing iS,</v>
<v Speaker 13>is that the way that you're taking it </v>

2544
02:13:57.931 --> 02:14:01.530
<v Speaker 13>very head on and seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I think I can personally commend that.</v>

2545
02:14:01.531 --> 02:14:04.560
<v Speaker 13>I admire a few hurdles in my life as </v>
<v Speaker 13>well.</v>

2546
02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:05.773
<v Speaker 13>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but I feel as though also when you were </v>

2547
02:14:08.071 --> 02:14:09.400
<v Speaker 13>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

2548
02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:13.250
<v Speaker 13>kind of facing an impasse indian year a </v>
<v Speaker 13>uploaded,</v>

2549
02:14:13.530 --> 02:14:17.070
<v Speaker 13>because I remember like when ray William</v>
<v Speaker 13>Johnson stopped posting,</v>

2550
02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:18.053
<v Speaker 13>you said something along the lines of he</v>
<v Speaker 13>no longer feels gratitude and doing the </v>

2551
02:14:21.031 --> 02:14:21.864
<v Speaker 13>same thing over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So it got me thinking that if you keep </v>

2552
02:14:24.451 --> 02:14:28.770
<v Speaker 13>doing the same type of style,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the same formulaic technique,</v>

2553
02:14:29.130 --> 02:14:29.820
<v Speaker 13>a,</v>
<v Speaker 13>wouldn't you?</v>

2554
02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:32.940
<v Speaker 13>Would you feel like less intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 13>challenged by doing these videos?</v>

2555
02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:34.703
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that I think so much of an </v>

2556
02:14:37.861 --> 02:14:38.694
<v Speaker 1>even maybe what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much of the negative feelings that </v>

2557
02:14:41.671 --> 02:14:42.504
<v Speaker 1>you might feel is a symptom of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressive state and not actually an </v>

2558
02:14:46.021 --> 02:14:46.854
<v Speaker 1>expressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an expression of like your creative art </v>

2559
02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:50.513
<v Speaker 1>and that there's always a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge yourself and there's always a </v>

2560
02:14:53.701 --> 02:14:58.320
<v Speaker 1>way to make it fresh and interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that when you're depressed,</v>

2561
02:14:58.590 --> 02:14:59.423
<v Speaker 1>you see everything through that lens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so something I've learned about </v>

2562
02:15:02.431 --> 02:15:07.431
<v Speaker 1>myself is that before I started actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>treating my depression with medicine and</v>

2563
02:15:07.831 --> 02:15:09.510
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you try,</v>

2564
02:15:09.570 --> 02:15:10.403
<v Speaker 1>you scramble and scramble and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>address your depression because you </v>

2565
02:15:13.981 --> 02:15:14.814
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know or you haven't accepted </v>

2566
02:15:16.381 --> 02:15:17.460
<v Speaker 1>that you're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2567
02:15:17.670 --> 02:15:18.503
<v Speaker 1>So you're trying and in your Mind and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life to address all of these </v>

2568
02:15:22.021 --> 02:15:23.040
<v Speaker 1>different issues that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2569
02:15:23.041 --> 02:15:25.350
<v Speaker 1>that's why this and that's why that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why this,</v>

2570
02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:29.880
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is you're never actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing the root problem.</v>

2571
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:32.400
<v Speaker 1>You're addressing symptoms but never the</v>
<v Speaker 1>root problem.</v>

2572
02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:35.280
<v Speaker 1>So when you're depressed and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>address that,</v>

2573
02:15:35.610 --> 02:15:38.900
<v Speaker 1>you're always looking for some answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you always to change.</v>

2574
02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:39.893
<v Speaker 1>And the sad thing about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to fix it until you </v>

2575
02:15:42.631 --> 02:15:44.790
<v Speaker 1>address the root cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

2576
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.863
<v Speaker 1>now that I'm feeling better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making videos is a wholesome thing and </v>

2577
02:15:48.991 --> 02:15:49.824
<v Speaker 1>I'm content doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where before I was always looking for </v>

2578
02:15:52.471 --> 02:15:53.610
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2579
02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I need to make a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to work on the podcast more.</v>

2580
02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I need to get off you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>

2581
02:15:58.471 --> 02:16:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I need to do all these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those were never the answer.</v>

2582
02:16:00.811 --> 02:16:05.811
<v Speaker 1>Those were just me looking in vain for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to make me feel better because</v>

2583
02:16:06.091 --> 02:16:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I didn't actually understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now that I'm in a better place,</v>

2584
02:16:09.031 --> 02:16:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I can see that this is a good place for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2585
02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:13.313
<v Speaker 1>And it is a whole someplace for me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to express yourself </v>

2586
02:16:16.471 --> 02:16:19.950
<v Speaker 1>creatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always a room within the formula</v>

2587
02:16:19.951 --> 02:16:23.550
<v Speaker 1>you've created to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find a good,</v>

2588
02:16:23.551 --> 02:16:24.780
<v Speaker 1>wholesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive,</v>

2589
02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:25.793
<v Speaker 1>happy place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of coming at it </v>

2590
02:16:28.021 --> 02:16:29.410
<v Speaker 1>through the light lens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2591
02:16:29.411 --> 02:16:30.244
<v Speaker 1>it really is a half glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a glass half full half empty thing and </v>

2592
02:16:33.490 --> 02:16:37.960
<v Speaker 1>when you're depressed it's sad is sadly </v>
<v Speaker 1>is always half empty and you really just</v>

2593
02:16:37.961 --> 02:16:40.780
<v Speaker 1>can never see the flip side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

2594
02:16:41.010 --> 02:16:44.130
<v Speaker 13>the perspective is very difficult to see</v>
<v Speaker 13>in a positive light.</v>

2595
02:16:44.131 --> 02:16:45.760
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I completely agree.</v>

2596
02:16:47.130 --> 02:16:49.250
<v Speaker 13>So I want to make this a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Uh,</v>

2597
02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:51.270
<v Speaker 13>I didn't mean to drag the mood down,</v>

2598
02:16:51.570 --> 02:16:53.020
<v Speaker 1>never mind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the good questions.</v>

2599
02:16:53.021 --> 02:16:53.854
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't drag it on if people were </v>

2600
02:16:57.311 --> 02:16:59.780
<v Speaker 1>wondering the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's good actually to talk</v>

2601
02:16:59.890 --> 02:17:02.890
<v Speaker 13>good about it.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And since you know,</v>

2602
02:17:02.891 --> 02:17:03.724
<v Speaker 13>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 13>we're in the spirit of bringing up </v>

2603
02:17:04.871 --> 02:17:05.704
<v Speaker 13>things at the end of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I thought maybe it would be a little </v>

2604
02:17:08.470 --> 02:17:09.303
<v Speaker 13>nice mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 13>mentioned some of your best moments in </v>

2605
02:17:11.561 --> 02:17:14.050
<v Speaker 13>terms of videos on hd productions.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Right?</v>

2606
02:17:14.770 --> 02:17:19.770
<v Speaker 13>I really love the a gold digger.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It was,</v>

2607
02:17:19.970 --> 02:17:23.290
<v Speaker 13>it was honestly a really nice highlight </v>
<v Speaker 13>for me because,</v>

2608
02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:25.390
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

2609
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:28.240
<v Speaker 13>all you did was literally say,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

2610
02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:29.083
<v Speaker 13>the,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the guys just fucking following the </v>

2611
02:17:30.551 --> 02:17:33.400
<v Speaker 13>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 13>The woman was being completely honest,</v>

2612
02:17:33.401 --> 02:17:37.390
<v Speaker 13>which is exactly true.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And the thing is that repetition was,</v>

2613
02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:38.273
<v Speaker 13>was the highlight of the whole video </v>
<v Speaker 13>with it's the same thing over and over </v>

2614
02:17:41.561 --> 02:17:43.900
<v Speaker 13>and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 13>The cracks me up every single time,</v>

2615
02:17:43.901 --> 02:17:44.390
<v Speaker 13>honestly.</v>

2616
02:17:44.390 --> 02:17:45.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>

2617
02:17:45.171 --> 02:17:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a great one.</v>

2618
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.650
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2619
02:17:48.650 --> 02:17:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I liked it because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a little bit of a twist because I</v>

2620
02:17:52.161 --> 02:17:55.790
<v Speaker 1>kinda resent all the gold digger content</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see on youtube.</v>

2621
02:17:55.791 --> 02:17:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I always thought it was just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

2622
02:17:58.941 --> 02:17:59.774
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you finally get to see inside this </v>

2623
02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:03.433
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote gold digger relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize that he's the flyer and </v>

2624
02:18:08.001 --> 02:18:08.834
<v Speaker 1>she's completely honest about her </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations in the beginning and he's </v>

2625
02:18:12.081 --> 02:18:13.190
<v Speaker 1>the one that mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let her.</v>

2626
02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:14.033
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was kind of a funny twist on the </v>

2627
02:18:16.311 --> 02:18:18.470
<v Speaker 1>whole narrative of the gold digger.</v>

2628
02:18:20.050 --> 02:18:20.883
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 13>no.</v>

2629
02:18:20.890 --> 02:18:22.270
<v Speaker 13>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>honestly,</v>

2630
02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:24.530
<v Speaker 13>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 13>is that it's.</v>

2631
02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:27.830
<v Speaker 13>People look at things like specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

2632
02:18:28.030 --> 02:18:29.770
<v Speaker 13>she's a gold digger,</v>
<v Speaker 13>she wants money.</v>

2633
02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:31.870
<v Speaker 13>That's a negative thing.</v>
<v Speaker 13>He's the victim.</v>

2634
02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:32.891
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

2635
02:18:32.891 --> 02:18:33.724
<v Speaker 13>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Well she said she's just literally </v>

2636
02:18:35.711 --> 02:18:36.544
<v Speaker 13>saying that doesn't make it negative.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's negative when you're trying to </v>

2637
02:18:39.401 --> 02:18:40.234
<v Speaker 13>deceive someone,</v>
<v Speaker 13>not just achieve an objective was being </v>

2638
02:18:44.220 --> 02:18:45.130
<v Speaker 13>hunches that,</v>
<v Speaker 13>hey,</v>

2639
02:18:45.131 --> 02:18:47.290
<v Speaker 13>this is what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Can you give it to me?</v>

2640

<v Speaker 1>pretended to love him and he's also an </v>

2643
02:18:53.551 --> 02:18:54.790
<v Speaker 1>interest for her looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 13>it was never meant to work out.</v>

<v Speaker 13>It's never about.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's 99.</v>

<v Speaker 1>heating season.</v>

2653
02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Starting in so deep into data happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>is unimaginable.</v>

2654
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 1>People are saying it's the</v>

2655
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:31.190
<v Speaker 2>darkest season ever and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>abandoning the show,</v>

2656
02:19:31.191 --> 02:19:34.030
<v Speaker 2>but I'm totally suck then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2657
02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:35.500
<v Speaker 13>I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>That guy,</v>

2658
02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:37.830
<v Speaker 13>the guy from the show got arrested</v>

2659
02:19:38.050 --> 02:19:43.050
<v Speaker 2>or they charge and I plug in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called it too because in the show he's</v>

2660
02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:47.060
<v Speaker 2>the guys walking around with backpacks </v>
<v Speaker 2>of weed,</v>

2661
02:19:47.700 --> 02:19:49.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

2662
02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:52.380
<v Speaker 2>and then a couple months later they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2663

2664
02:19:53.851 --> 02:19:56.820

<v Speaker 2>weed and sure enough,</v>

<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

<v Speaker 2>at least be richer than that.</v>

2675
02:20:25.930 --> 02:20:27.820
<v Speaker 13>There's two levels of pathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

2676
02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:29.213
<v Speaker 13>There's,</v>

<v Speaker 13>that to pretend to be a successful </v>
<v Speaker 13>loser.</v>

2682
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:40.440
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>that's just,</v>

<v Speaker 13>Just pick it for me like that.</v>

2684
02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:45.620
<v Speaker 13>And honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I just wanted to also tell you that,</v>

2685
02:20:45.850 --> 02:20:47.380
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>your commentary style,</v>

2686
02:20:47.381 --> 02:20:49.420
<v Speaker 13>everything you've done for the past </v>
<v Speaker 13>high.</v>

2687
02:20:49.470 --> 02:20:51.460
<v Speaker 13>No,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I don't have the exact number of years,</v>

2688
02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:53.410
<v Speaker 13>but you've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's really awesome.</v>

2689
02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:56.980
<v Speaker 13>it kind of pushed me to start my own </v>
<v Speaker 13>youtube and everything.</v>

2690
02:20:57.370 --> 02:21:01.480
<v Speaker 13>So I had a little,</v>
<v Speaker 13>a few questions before I do my shameless</v>

2691
02:21:01.481 --> 02:21:03.460
<v Speaker 13>plug in.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Before I get there,</v>

2692
02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:07.120
<v Speaker 13>I have some genuine questions for you.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So what,</v>

2693
02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:08.013
<v Speaker 13>since we're at the end of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 13>this is also kind of a little did </v>

2694
02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:11.413
<v Speaker 13>retrospective,</v>
<v Speaker 13>what first motivated you to make these </v>

2695
02:21:12.761 --> 02:21:13.594
<v Speaker 13>videos?</v>

2696
02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:15.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I knew that I wanted to work in </v>

2697
02:21:17.571 --> 02:21:18.404
<v Speaker 2>comedy for a long time Just because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was something I was always passionate </v>

2698
02:21:20.901 --> 02:21:22.760
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I Really never,</v>

2699
02:21:23.690 --> 02:21:24.523
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any connections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know anyone and I didn't have </v>

2700
02:21:27.171 --> 02:21:30.950
<v Speaker 2>any experience making comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>

2701
02:21:31.730 --> 02:21:32.563
<v Speaker 2>I think I've mentioned this before but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but well either we made a couple of </v>

2702
02:21:36.291 --> 02:21:39.050
<v Speaker 2>videos for els class and it was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun and I,</v>

2703
02:21:39.350 --> 02:21:40.183
<v Speaker 2>And I actually thought I had a knack for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it even though they weren't good or </v>

2704
02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:46.310
<v Speaker 2>they're very weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really enjoyed the process.</v>

2705
02:21:46.311 --> 02:21:47.144
<v Speaker 2>So for me it was kind of started as just</v>
<v Speaker 2>a creative outlet and kind of honing my </v>

2706
02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:56.560
<v Speaker 2>craft and figuring out my style and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>just slowly turned into having a youtube</v>

2707
02:22:00.141 --> 02:22:00.974
<v Speaker 2>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is funny because when we started </v>

2708
02:22:02.121 --> 02:22:06.830
<v Speaker 2>making youtube videos I didn't even know</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to being a youtuber was a thing.</v>

2709
02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:08.113
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just posted it there but we didn't </v>

2710
02:22:10.791 --> 02:22:11.900
<v Speaker 2>know like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2711
02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:12.411
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2712
02:22:12.411 --> 02:22:13.244
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just basically a hobby that </v>

2713
02:22:15.741 --> 02:22:19.520
<v Speaker 2>somehow slowly started turning into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something serious.</v>

2714
02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:22.233
<v Speaker 13>But I guess she had had some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 13>continuous motivation at the beginning </v>

2715
02:22:25.711 --> 02:22:26.544
<v Speaker 13>of youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 13>The idea of monetization was just this </v>

2716
02:22:28.531 --> 02:22:29.620
<v Speaker 13>abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

2717
02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:30.900
<v Speaker 13>far away thought.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Right.</v>

2718
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:34.590
<v Speaker 13>So you were doing it based on personal </v>
<v Speaker 13>ambition,</v>

2719
02:22:34.591 --> 02:22:35.424
<v Speaker 13>personal,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I guess ambition to succeed in this </v>

2720
02:22:37.981 --> 02:22:39.120
<v Speaker 13>industry which is youtube.</v>

2721
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:40.423
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my original idea was that I was like </v>

2722
02:22:42.651 --> 02:22:45.950
<v Speaker 2>making a portfolio because at best I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

2723
02:22:46.040 --> 02:22:46.873
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be a writer or something for </v>

2724
02:22:48.650 --> 02:22:49.483
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was just thinking of youtube as a </v>

2725
02:22:51.861 --> 02:22:56.861
<v Speaker 2>stepping stone of kind of just building </v>
<v Speaker 2>a portfolio and honing my craft and just</v>

2726
02:22:57.771 --> 02:23:00.290
<v Speaker 2>as a hobby to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anything better to do.</v>

2727
02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:05.150
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of it in the beginning as</v>

2728
02:23:05.151 --> 02:23:07.490
<v Speaker 2>a portfolio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that and be like,</v>

2729
02:23:07.491 --> 02:23:08.324
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could make a couple of funny </v>

2730
02:23:08.841 --> 02:23:12.470
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe I can get a job somewhere.</v>

2731
02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:16.410
<v Speaker 13>I made a lot of people from college </v>
<v Speaker 13>humor.</v>

2732
02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:17.600
<v Speaker 13>That's what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

2733
02:23:17.610 --> 02:23:18.320
<v Speaker 13>the,</v>
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

2734
02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:21.060
<v Speaker 13>it became writers at the daily show,</v>
<v Speaker 13>stuff like that.</v>

2735
02:23:21.061 --> 02:23:24.390
<v Speaker 13>I completely get you.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I'm fair enough,</v>

2736
02:23:24.391 --> 02:23:25.520
<v Speaker 13>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

2737
02:23:25.620 --> 02:23:27.300
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>first of all,</v>

2738
02:23:27.301 --> 02:23:28.500
<v Speaker 13>I,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I know this is,</v>

2739
02:23:28.830 --> 02:23:31.350
<v Speaker 13>this is a little bit of a funny story </v>
<v Speaker 13>concerning your name.</v>

2740
02:23:31.351 --> 02:23:35.070
<v Speaker 13>I'm from Saudi Arabia and we have this </v>
<v Speaker 13>weird thing with the language.</v>

2741
02:23:35.071 --> 02:23:35.904
<v Speaker 13>Basically the letters and the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Some numbers because we have different </v>

2742
02:23:39.331 --> 02:23:40.050
<v Speaker 13>letters,</v>
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

2743
02:23:40.050 --> 02:23:40.883
<v Speaker 13>It's an arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So some letters are expressed witH </v>

2744
02:23:43.321 --> 02:23:44.154
<v Speaker 13>numbers and when I was trying to plug </v>
<v Speaker 13>your channel to everyone I guess in </v>

2745
02:23:49.141 --> 02:23:52.020
<v Speaker 13>school when I was a kid I would just say</v>
<v Speaker 13>h three,</v>

2746
02:23:52.021 --> 02:23:52.854
<v Speaker 13>h three and the thing is is that when </v>
<v Speaker 13>they read that it says everyone sounded </v>

2747
02:23:58.831 --> 02:23:59.940
<v Speaker 13>like,</v>

<v Speaker 13>other.</v>

2750
02:24:07.170 --> 02:24:08.003
<v Speaker 13>So basIcally I was plugging it </v>
<v Speaker 13>everywhere and people thought I was </v>

2751
02:24:11.011 --> 02:24:11.844
<v Speaker 13>spasming.</v>

2752
