00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but this pizza is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This pizza's a little too overcooked.</v>

43

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm check this out.</v>

45
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.690
<v Speaker 1>So Papa John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you guys all know,</v>

46
00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:35.381
<v Speaker 1>they're late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

47
00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Papa John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was outed from Papa John,</v>

48
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a whole kind of paradoxical</v>

49
00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:43.054
<v Speaker 1>situation going on with Papa Johns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Papa John is trying to kick Papa John </v>

50
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.313
<v Speaker 1>Out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how can papa John Be Papa John </v>

51
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.013
<v Speaker 1>Without Papa John?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Papa John the company is trying to </v>

52
00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:56.770
<v Speaker 1>kick out Papa John the person the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shatner,</v>

53
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.933
<v Speaker 1>but they are proper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John just change your name at that </v>

54
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Papa John Pizza.</v>

55
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:03.304
<v Speaker 1>You can't separate the pizza from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>man so they're trying to distance </v>

56
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:10.980
<v Speaker 1>themselves from here as much as possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his face is all over.</v>

57
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.640
<v Speaker 1>So they removed his face from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>branding that was white.</v>

58
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>That's what was the final Straw for papa</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

59
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot take my face off that Pi box.</v>

60
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.373
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because basically my face looks like a </v>

61
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:23.644
<v Speaker 1>pizza pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spent so much time near a pizza </v>

62
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:25.924
<v Speaker 1>oven and it's basically a preview of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to be like when you open </v>

63
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're saying we can't be dependent</v>

64
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>on one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially this person.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>garlic,</v>

126
00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 1>salt shatner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

127
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:42.800
<v Speaker 1>he also wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are getting the truth out there.</v>

128
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bar,</v>

129
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 1>my butter garlic sauce was invented as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to make my own sex lubricant.</v>

130
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 1>My wife tasted it accidentally and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

131
00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.130
<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was emotional.</v>

132
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A roller coaster.</v>

133
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.803
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for the sex stuff that is all </v>

134
00:08:07.171 --> 00:08:09.630
<v Speaker 1>written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was very dramatic,</v>

135
00:08:09.631 --> 00:08:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Papa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

136
00:08:10.651 --> 00:08:11.484
<v Speaker 1>I don't know in his mind he really sees </v>
<v Speaker 1>this as a big pizza war when people are </v>

137
00:08:15.421 --> 00:08:17.670
<v Speaker 1>picking sides there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a lot of support.</v>

138
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's people demonstrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the White House right now,</v>

139
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.623
<v Speaker 1>Free Papa</v>

140
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.000
<v Speaker 1>and his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's fine.</v>

141
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is a war right now.</v>

142
00:08:29.161 --> 00:08:34.161
<v Speaker 1>But when Papa John's and Papa Johns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Papa Johns exist without Papa John.</v>

143
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like when the civil war happened,</v>

144
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.600
<v Speaker 1>a country divided cannot stand as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham Lincoln famously said.</v>

145
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:43.723
<v Speaker 1>And I feel that Papa John is kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pizza civil rights leader in his own </v>

146
00:08:46.861 --> 00:08:51.861
<v Speaker 1>right when the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a hot or this is a hot oven.</v>

147
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 1>A cheesy on other than about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

148
00:08:57.931 --> 00:09:01.420
<v Speaker 1>this is just his life story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

149
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.573
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's actually got all the legal papers </v>

150
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>because he's suing Papa John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

151
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:10.510
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y'all started a war with a fucking.</v>

152
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you could finish it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got feed some money.</v>

153
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just loved his little cover letter.</v>

154
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.540
<v Speaker 1>So pop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish you all the best in your fight.</v>

155
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a standing invitation for Papa </v>
<v Speaker 1>to complete his case on our show.</v>

156
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.780
<v Speaker 1>We had previously reached out and better</v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

157
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.780
<v Speaker 1>and I have to say papa passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

158
00:09:34.781 --> 00:09:35.614
<v Speaker 1>I got Peyton manning throwing pizzas </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the American living rooms of </v>

159
00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now all the sudden.</v>

160
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Who would you have left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Papa?</v>

161
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you have left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

163
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:52.330

<v Speaker 1>we're going to have a good old fashion.</v>

164
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Reach around soggy pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone know what that is?</v>

165
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Soggy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soggy pizza when the pizza got saggy.</v>

166
00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Or is this like a metaphor for something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else?</v>

167
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it Swiss?</v>

169

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want me to break down?</v>

237
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.863
<v Speaker 1>Naughty teabag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a naughty girl with a big old </v>

238
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.780
<v Speaker 1>thick presumably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

239
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.770
<v Speaker 1>She and then her name is Marissa and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and she has.</v>

240
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:55.590
<v Speaker 1>She has an insatiable hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is so thirsty for COC.</v>

241
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 1>She's so hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's relieved.</v>

242
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.920
<v Speaker 1>She's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has this insatiable hunger for coc,</v>

243
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.900
<v Speaker 1>but yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's this done?</v>

244
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure that if the guy that</v>

245
00:14:07.421 --> 00:14:08.900
<v Speaker 1>fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

246
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.710
<v Speaker 1>think it goes back to a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a horse though,</v>

247
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:16.711
<v Speaker 1>but it's like that guy's a fucking stud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this girl with this insatiable hunger</v>

248
00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:17.764
<v Speaker 1>for coc has finally after all of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>searching on the earth for this one </v>

249
00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:24.370
<v Speaker 1>study that could relieve for thirst for </v>
<v Speaker 1>coc,</v>

250
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
<v Speaker 1>she was relieved of Caulk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger by Stud.</v>

251
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not one to judge,</v>

252
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:38.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch whatever you want.</v>

253
00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:39.214
<v Speaker 1>But it is Alex Jones and he did have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video titled Naughty Tba Marie Main </v>

254
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Relieved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relieved of caulk hunger.</v>

255
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.360
<v Speaker 1>I love the Alex Jones was watching that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't addressed it by the way.</v>

256
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how,</v>

257
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:55.750
<v Speaker 1>what do say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was relieved of our hunger.</v>

258
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.770
<v Speaker 1>To be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he may,</v>

259
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.633
<v Speaker 1>he may have addressed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hunted really hard and that this </v>

260
00:15:04.191 --> 00:15:07.850
<v Speaker 1>is such outstanding news that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you google anything related to this,</v>

261
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 1>all you're going to find his articles </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

262
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this insatiable tb.</v>

263
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:17.860
<v Speaker 1>The interesting thing about Alex Jones </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a transport is that heat,</v>

264
00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:23.240
<v Speaker 1>one of his strikes that he got before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the closure of his gentle was four.</v>

265
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.470
<v Speaker 1>He called Trans people mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

266
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 1>that's nice because like you maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally ill,</v>

267
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:29.984
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that doesn't mean I can't beat </v>

268
00:15:30.891 --> 00:15:31.724
<v Speaker 1>off to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make him mentally ill if he </v>

269
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 1>likes it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it does.</v>

270
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.600
<v Speaker 1>By calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe would have said.</v>

271
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't make him say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just love.</v>

272
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:46.760
<v Speaker 1>This is so funny.</v>

273
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:52.060

<v Speaker 1>Next time you see Alex Jones,</v>

277
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Jones to call him and tell us about </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 90 day fiance.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Isa.</v>

281
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.150

<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

282
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.240
<v Speaker 1>this show is just a goldmine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety day fiance eats well here.</v>

283
00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I thought this show was like an old </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

284
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:32.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's still going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

285
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean it may have been around for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

286
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:37.070
<v Speaker 1>How long has it been around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just looks like it's from the night is.</v>

287
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

288
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.543
<v Speaker 1>But it's still going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to set dvr to record this show </v>

289
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:46.730
<v Speaker 1>because it seems like got to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the more entertaining shows on TV.</v>

290
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.533
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

291
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.863
<v Speaker 1>so this lady has married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in African and she is an </v>

292
00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Africa visiting the family now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The family,</v>

293
00:16:57.531 --> 00:17:02.531
<v Speaker 1>one of their native dishes is snails and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's very hesitant to eat the snails,</v>

294
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.473
<v Speaker 1>which makes sense to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but be respectful in their face of your </v>

295
00:17:08.871 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 1>fiance's family and you meet the snails </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you enjoy them.</v>

296
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.823
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

297
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.000
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.730
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't seem to be someone who has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem eating food,</v>

299
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.420
<v Speaker 1>so she doesn't seem necessarily that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have a problem putting it down.</v>

300
00:17:22.421 --> 00:17:23.254
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

301
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.060
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks good.</v>

302
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.440
<v Speaker 5>It looks cooked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean</v>

303
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.840
<v Speaker 1>got a little nice like tomato sauce in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

304
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Little creamy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

305
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.183
<v Speaker 1>So native dish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a central person except for being </v>

306
00:17:56.501 --> 00:17:58.670
<v Speaker 1>respectful to his mom for every meal.</v>

307
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to taste.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She out there,</v>

308
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.990
<v Speaker 5>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm terrified right now.</v>

309
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.273
<v Speaker 6>It's very quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a quiet predestined is I'm a boost </v>

310
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.030
<v Speaker 6>in it as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So cell phone quality.</v>

311
00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.510
<v Speaker 6>If she takes a little bite and going </v>
<v Speaker 6>okay with it,</v>

312
00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 6>he ripped off and sent her mouth and a </v>
<v Speaker 6>kiss me,</v>

313
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.420
<v Speaker 6>her fiance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>me and get it out of my mouth.</v>

314
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.700
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're watching by the way,</v>

315
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.090
<v Speaker 6>you're not slipping up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what are you doing?</v>

316
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.970
<v Speaker 1>They saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

317
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.133
<v Speaker 1>So she basically said to her fiance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kiss me and let me spit it into your </v>

318
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:45.330
<v Speaker 1>mouth so that I don't have to chew it </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

319
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Speaker 1>That's not paying respect to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

320
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.580
<v Speaker 1>that's horrifying thing to witness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just handed out on your plate and say,</v>

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.350
<v Speaker 6>Coaster comes to past and that is a </v>
<v Speaker 6>romantic kiss</v>

339

<v Speaker 6>Thank you Michael.</v>

343
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

344
00:20:03.281 --> 00:20:04.114
<v Speaker 1>the things I do for a green card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these relationships on these shows are </v>

345
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.320
<v Speaker 1>really all about getting a green card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any of these relationships</v>

346
00:20:12.321 --> 00:20:13.154
<v Speaker 1>were genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really what's so interesting </v>

347
00:20:15.351 --> 00:20:16.184
<v Speaker 1>about this show is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this one person is willing to </v>

348
00:20:19.911 --> 00:20:20.750
<v Speaker 1>take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

349
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:21.933
<v Speaker 1>It's like one eligible datable person </v>
<v Speaker 1>matched up with one completely </v>

350
00:20:25.221 --> 00:20:26.054
<v Speaker 1>undateable person and then you kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just see how much that one datable </v>

351
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:30.883
<v Speaker 1>person can do indoor for a green card.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nearing my asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we all came for a lot of </v>

371
00:21:43.421 --> 00:21:44.254
<v Speaker 1>debate over last week about wiping </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques about how best to approach </v>

372
00:21:50.801 --> 00:21:52.450
<v Speaker 1>the Asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how best to clean it,</v>

373
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:53.284
<v Speaker 1>how best to manicure it.</v>

374
00:21:56.141 --> 00:21:59.470
<v Speaker 1>said they near their asshole and that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed their life for the better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

376
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:04.320
<v Speaker 1>So preposterous.</v>

385
00:22:30.011 --> 00:22:30.844

<v Speaker 1>So I was trying to distract myself from </v>

386
00:22:35.801 --> 00:22:37.540
<v Speaker 1>the onset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck they found you?</v>

387
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Who found her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

388
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.050
<v Speaker 1>These are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just in a private channel,</v>

389
00:22:44.051 --> 00:22:49.051
<v Speaker 1>which was does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's Raz sneaking in.</v>

390
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.073
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our private discourse getting </v>

391
00:22:53.311 --> 00:22:54.144
<v Speaker 1>infiltrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we are talking about narrowing my </v>

392
00:22:56.831 --> 00:22:57.664
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if everyone could please focus </v>

393
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.690
<v Speaker 1>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

394
00:23:00.691 --> 00:23:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

395
00:23:01.661 --> 00:23:02.494
<v Speaker 1>I was about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to near my asshole because </v>

396
00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:04.960
<v Speaker 1>it just seems so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

397
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

398
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other side of me was like,</v>

399
00:23:09.191 --> 00:23:12.700
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane thing to do.</v>

400
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.630
<v Speaker 1>And you could burn your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:18.610
<v Speaker 1>And the asshole is pretty sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

402
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Apparently from what I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I also,</v>

403
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:26.980
<v Speaker 1>I had a feeling that this guy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking with me.</v>

404
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.350
<v Speaker 1>He seemed genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can see someone be like,</v>

405
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:30.184
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get Ethan and narrows asshole </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing full well that would ruin my </v>

406
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:34.024
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So another great fan emailed me and was </v>

407
00:23:37.391 --> 00:23:38.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

408
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.980
<v Speaker 1>do not near your app.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here is why.</v>

409
00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:44.440
<v Speaker 1>And he sent me this craigslist story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was so funny.</v>

410
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I had to read it to you because I had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>share it with you guys.</v>

411
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.780
<v Speaker 1>So for now this story alone put my </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow,</v>

412
00:23:51.781 --> 00:23:53.750
<v Speaker 1>my asshole on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>

413
00:23:53.751 --> 00:23:55.130
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still open to it.</v>

414
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got the product at home.</v>

415
00:23:56.871 --> 00:23:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the PR.</v>

416
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I got three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why an Amazon.</v>

417
00:23:59.001 --> 00:24:01.780
<v Speaker 1>They made me buy three bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like on this fucking weird guy.</v>

418
00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:06.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just like I have an apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stash of narrowing my asshole.</v>

419
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world may be ending,</v>

420
00:24:08.451 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 1>but my asshole is going to be clean.</v>

421
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.970
<v Speaker 1>One of them was called involves bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

422
00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:18.530
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to say in my pursuit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive nature that would've burned my</v>

423
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.543
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a product called balls bomb </v>

424
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.660
<v Speaker 1>that's made for applying to your balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Balls.</v>

425
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Bomb Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a bike,</v>

426
00:24:27.451 --> 00:24:30.230
<v Speaker 1>some balls bond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

427
00:24:30.231 --> 00:24:32.630
<v Speaker 1>I've got balls bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

428
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking of just getting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just seeing what happens.</v>

429
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.590
<v Speaker 1>But you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys read this and tell me.</v>

430
00:24:39.591 --> 00:24:41.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This spooked me most.</v>

431
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Most definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it rang so true.</v>

432
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Let me zoom in on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was from craigslist,</v>

433
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 1>it's called a warning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't shave that hair.</v>

434
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I've recently made a mistake in my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I offer my story to you that you may</v>

435
00:24:55.221 --> 00:24:57.980
<v Speaker 1>learn from my air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all started as many things to do with</v>

436
00:24:57.981 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 1>me having trouble shitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you write this?</v>

437
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

438
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I think we need some kind of music.</v>

439
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.860
<v Speaker 1>What kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of stories I want to play when</v>

440
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.360
<v Speaker 1>you play sad violin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

441
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.690
<v Speaker 1>let me try and find some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

442
00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:16.520
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not constipated.</v>

443
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.910
<v Speaker 1>This was not a regularity problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a matter of technique.</v>

444
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:25.100
<v Speaker 1>It seems my ass hair had grown to such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>length that my tiny grope Grogan's we're</v>

445
00:25:25.101 --> 00:25:30.101
<v Speaker 1>constantly getting tied up and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jungle between my ass cheeks.</v>

446
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:31.993
<v Speaker 1>It led so much frustration with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that I still had something to </v>

447
00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:39.851
<v Speaker 1>drop but not able to shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tenacious turned loose from its butt</v>

448
00:25:41.111 --> 00:25:44.570
<v Speaker 1>hair dwelling eventually would have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do two things,</v>

449
00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:47.760
<v Speaker 1>either reached down with some paper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to pinch off the lingering low,</v>

450
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.093
<v Speaker 1>which required careful precision to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid smearing the creature over my </v>

451
00:25:51.471 --> 00:25:52.304
<v Speaker 1>rear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially since I had no way of seeing </v>

452
00:25:54.321 --> 00:25:55.154
<v Speaker 1>what I was doing or just go for broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start wiping and hope that I can remove </v>

453
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 1>all the leftover fecal matter before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>toilet reached.</v>

454
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.710
<v Speaker 1>It's can't be flushed threshold.</v>

455
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I was contemplating this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very long.</v>

456
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you cut through the paraphrase here?</v>

457
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Let me paraphrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Yada,</v>

458
00:26:16.991 --> 00:26:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Yada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yada.</v>

459
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.753
<v Speaker 1>He did the deed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have great respect for anal hair </v>

460
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.020
<v Speaker 1>like everything in this world God </v>
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>

461
00:26:23.021 --> 00:26:25.120
<v Speaker 1>It has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all my purpose and existence.</v>

462
00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.413
<v Speaker 1>It was only after I had removed it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I started to learn how much I had been </v>

463
00:26:29.141 --> 00:26:31.090
<v Speaker 1>taking it for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For one,</v>

464
00:26:31.091 --> 00:26:31.924
<v Speaker 1>it provides friction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned that this next day when I </v>

465
00:26:33.941 --> 00:26:35.770
<v Speaker 1>walked out into the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the headed for class.</v>

466
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.590
<v Speaker 1>After climbing two flights of stairs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to sweat,</v>

467
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I started to notice something </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant.</v>

468
00:26:40.601 --> 00:26:41.434
<v Speaker 1>The sweat was accumulating in my crap </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's causing the unpleasant </v>

469
00:26:44.491 --> 00:26:48.390
<v Speaker 1>sensation of Mike to ask Jake sliding </v>
<v Speaker 1>past each other with every step.</v>

470
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I thought about going to the bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and starting the wipe it off,</v>

471
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.910
<v Speaker 1>but I had to go to class.</v>

472
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I thought eventually it would drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately it did dry,</v>

473
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.943
<v Speaker 1>but only after mingling with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>microscopic shit molecules lingering </v>

474
00:27:01.801 --> 00:27:04.200
<v Speaker 1>around my ground starfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

475
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.143
<v Speaker 1>When I stood up after your class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ass chiefs were stuck together and a </v>

476
00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.840
<v Speaker 1>slimy sticky shit sweat combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As that made my way back to the dorm.</v>

477
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.143
<v Speaker 1>It started to itch God did it itch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like a swarm of ants was making </v>

478
00:27:18.571 --> 00:27:22.890
<v Speaker 1>its way up and down my craft fighting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep from jamming my hand down there and</v>

479
00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:25.350
<v Speaker 1>scratching away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rushed back to the dorm.</v>

480
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this excretion caused me to sweat.</v>

481
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.760
<v Speaker 1>And when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

482
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.823
<v Speaker 1>when I finally reached my room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my cheeks were sliding back and forth </v>

483
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:38.040
<v Speaker 1>against each other like a pair of Horny </v>
<v Speaker 1>cane toads.</v>

484
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.233
<v Speaker 1>I quickly dropped my pants and attempted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to drive my ass by sticking it in front </v>

485
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:45.110
<v Speaker 1>of a fan and spreading my cheeks.</v>

486
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 1>As I pulled the two mounds of flesh </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>

487
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.770
<v Speaker 1>a horrible stench burst free and filled </v>
<v Speaker 1>the room.</v>

488
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Every dog within four blocks started the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

489
00:27:55.830 --> 00:28:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I had the worst of it as the ripe aroma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a festering shit and sweat went into the</v>

490
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:03.930
<v Speaker 1>fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my face,</v>

491
00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I thought to keep from heaving as I sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>there fighting,</v>

492
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:13.320
<v Speaker 1>vomit in my ass cheeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bread and tripping with the concentrated</v>

493
00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:17.910
<v Speaker 1>aroma of my body odor mixed with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tangy smell of my own shit blowing right</v>

494
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:19.590
<v Speaker 1>into my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only had one thought.</v>

495
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I will be like this until my hair grows </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

496
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.560
<v Speaker 1>For weeks later on trying to deal as </v>
<v Speaker 1>best I could,</v>

497
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:26.693
<v Speaker 1>wiping my asset every opportunity I </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered another wonderful use for </v>

498
00:28:29.491 --> 00:28:33.210
<v Speaker 1>this ass hair ventilation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I attempted to launch a fart only to get</v>

499
00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:36.420
<v Speaker 1>it stuck between my ass cheeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently with no hair.</v>

500
00:28:36.421 --> 00:28:40.020
<v Speaker 1>The two pink twins kind of get vacuumed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sealed together.</v>

501
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.370
<v Speaker 1>And the result was a frustrating fart </v>
<v Speaker 1>that slid up and down between my cheeks,</v>

502
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.760
<v Speaker 1>like a last durable as if there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

503
00:28:47.761 --> 00:28:48.594
<v Speaker 1>I am known during further torture as </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who has ever shaved anything </v>

504
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:55.260
<v Speaker 1>knows when hair is growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes stubble.</v>

505
00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I imagine your ass having the texture of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Brillo pad.</v>

506
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Well that is what I'm dealing with now </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a hellish torture.</v>

507
00:29:01.771 --> 00:29:02.604
<v Speaker 1>And there are times when I just look out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the window and contemplate why I </v>

508
00:29:05.251 --> 00:29:09.170
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't just jump out and get it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over with rather than indoor.</v>

509
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.440
<v Speaker 1>This agony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friends,</v>

510
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:14.220
<v Speaker 1>do not shave your ass here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

511
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.580
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it.</v>

512
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Thank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

513
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you for that anecdote.</v>

514
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.780
<v Speaker 1>But what I think about is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

515
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I love the lawyer was almost vomiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

516
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I definitely get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

517
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:30.480
<v Speaker 1>but he shaved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

518
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:35.481
<v Speaker 1>I'm narrowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Narrowing is like shaving the stubble.</v>

519
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I won't deal with the stub a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will grow back.</v>

520
00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:40.050
<v Speaker 1>So basically once you narrow your </v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole,</v>

521
00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:43.330
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck in a vicious cycle because </v>
<v Speaker 1>once that stubble grows in and you're,</v>

522
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine your asshole itching </v>
<v Speaker 1>with every step.</v>

523
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.673
<v Speaker 1>You're back in there narrowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck in the net or stuck in a </v>

524
00:29:50.231 --> 00:29:51.064
<v Speaker 1>loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

525
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be doomed to a hairless </v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole forever.</v>

526
00:29:54.191 --> 00:29:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Or I'm gonna have to like take two weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>off that you can burn yourself.</v>

527
00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:58.803
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I keep telling you because I saw </v>

528
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:02.350
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was so entertaining to be like,</v>

529
00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:03.940
<v Speaker 1>okay guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I narrowed my asshole.</v>

530
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I also don't want to be the guy</v>

531
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:13.450
<v Speaker 1>that narrowed his asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what if I bought albums,</v>

532
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:15.280
<v Speaker 1>my asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

533
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I do fear of the shit and sweat of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>

534
00:30:20.801 --> 00:30:21.634
<v Speaker 1>The potential of vomit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God wouldn't be so great to hear you </v>

535
00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:27.550
<v Speaker 1>talk about the smell of my shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming.</v>

536
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you'll be there.</v>

537
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll not be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to leave me out.</v>

538
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.940
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't going to leave like damn I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

539
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 1>It was doing it for you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not asking for this.</v>

540
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still intrigued,</v>

541
00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:45.640
<v Speaker 1>but the guy definitely spooked me </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>

542
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I do want to tell you that the pole that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did on twitter.</v>

543
00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.253
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there hasn't been an update with the </v>

544
00:30:51.731 --> 00:30:55.330
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's open the pool actually.</v>

545
00:30:55.331 --> 00:30:59.260
<v Speaker 1>So I was so interested in this debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been having with,</v>

546
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.473
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the front or from the back because </v>

547
00:31:02.441 --> 00:31:03.340
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

548
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:07.900
<v Speaker 1>there's two worlds of wipers and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even know that they exist.</v>

549
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:08.973
<v Speaker 1>And I felt like an outcast my whole life</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lifting up my balls and reaching </v>

550
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:14.290
<v Speaker 1>under there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

551
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the HD podcasts on twitter,</v>

552
00:31:17.471 --> 00:31:20.410
<v Speaker 1>the HD podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I asked our loyal fans,</v>

553
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:25.450
<v Speaker 1>how do you wipe your ass from the front </v>
<v Speaker 1>or from the back?</v>

554
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.740
<v Speaker 1>And it may surprise you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have a lot of the,</v>

555
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.850
<v Speaker 1>a lot of results here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

556
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.990
<v Speaker 1>66,534</v>
<v Speaker 1>people participated.</v>

557
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.160
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this is an actual legitimate</v>

558
00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:39.994
<v Speaker 1>census of the American public life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is for men only because women only </v>

559
00:31:44.831 --> 00:31:45.664
<v Speaker 1>have one option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to wipe away from the </v>

560
00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:48.920
<v Speaker 1>badge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

561
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I do love the top comment here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think men wipe him.</v>

562
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.630
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

563
00:31:55.631 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the fuck she's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

564
00:31:57.131 --> 00:32:01.270
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's had a foul.</v>

565
00:32:01.271 --> 00:32:02.860
<v Speaker 1>She said some foul relationships.</v>

566
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:04.323
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she dated that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were just reading really every time </v>

567
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:11.800
<v Speaker 1>I've been with a guy just smells like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass and sweat.</v>

568
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.433
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so last time it was 60 slash 40 and now </v>

569
00:32:18.101 --> 00:32:18.934
<v Speaker 1>it's 60 1:39.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's been brigaded by the </v>

570
00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:23.950
<v Speaker 1>front labors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

571
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.353
<v Speaker 1>39 percent wiped from the front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are like minded brethren who </v>

572
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:31.120
<v Speaker 1>lifted their balls and prove and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

573
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.930
<v Speaker 1>perform a scoop from the front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a scoop.</v>

574
00:32:34.931 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 1>The way I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

575
00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:39.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a scoop and scoop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a skilled scoop.</v>

576
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Is this group that I've been developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>

577
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:44.030
<v Speaker 1>You lift the balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you scoop your clean baby,</v>

578
00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:45.920
<v Speaker 1>you scoop the shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a smear.</v>

579
00:32:45.921 --> 00:32:46.661
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

580
00:32:46.661 --> 00:32:47.494
<v Speaker 1>You can't give it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 61 percent a traditional white </v>

581
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:53.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I like scoot.</v>

582
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:56.540

<v Speaker 1>You can't wipe the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You scoop out of a hole.</v>

585
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.840

<v Speaker 1>So speak up front.</v>

593
00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Wipers don't leave me in the trenches </v>
<v Speaker 1>scoop and grenades out of my ass.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so powerful.</v>

599
00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:45.290
<v Speaker 1>It actually can act like Nair and </v>

<v Speaker 8>ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Britain niche audience that thing.</v>

722
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.753

<v Speaker 1>Eight hundred thousand page views to </v>

723

<v Speaker 1>shoe.</v>

726
00:40:33.111 --> 00:40:36.410
<v Speaker 8>them would be something like a pod by </v>
<v Speaker 8>pod.</v>

727
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.920
<v Speaker 8>Like Ryan's toy review</v>

728
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.410
<v Speaker 1>beat the shit out of a 12 year old.</v>

730
00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.900
<v Speaker 1>so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some stats for you guys.</v>

731
00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:47.843
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A general admission ticket started at </v>

732
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:52.024
<v Speaker 1>$39 with the highest price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to 600 average was probably like </v>

733
00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:59.230
<v Speaker 1>50 bucks a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sold out the arena,</v>

734
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.093
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan?</v>

735
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.353
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they sold out what they were </v>

736
00:41:03.941 --> 00:41:06.040
<v Speaker 1>offering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the arena actually sits 20,000</v>

737
00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:08.950
<v Speaker 1>and they only have 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>available for something,</v>

738
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.520
<v Speaker 1>so they sold 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>live attendee.</v>

739
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Take.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 8>it's just our notes are funny.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Heads up people with keep defining </v>

744
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:26.380
<v Speaker 8>story.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We did.</v>

745
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.990
<v Speaker 8>What did we skip?</v>
<v Speaker 8>But we could go back to it later and bed</v>

746
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.230
<v Speaker 8>a couple of.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh well hang on.</v>

747
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:37.040
<v Speaker 1>This is so related to everything we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

748
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.980
<v Speaker 1>but now it's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get to it later.</v>

749
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:41.503
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This young couple was using nair on </v>

750
00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:50.210
<v Speaker 1>their assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Ksi.</v>

751
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.070
<v Speaker 1>So they sold 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>live attendees.</v>

752
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.920
<v Speaker 1>They took him about $2 million at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>box office.</v>

753
00:41:54.921 --> 00:41:57.050
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

754
00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.490
<v Speaker 1>who am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

755
00:41:58.580 --> 00:41:59.413
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

756
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Eight hundred thousand youtube streams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

757
00:42:03.051 --> 00:42:07.170
<v Speaker 1>That is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was $10 per a paper review,</v>

758
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:11.000
<v Speaker 1>so that's about 10 million bucks in </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue.</v>

759
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.970
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you.</v>

760
00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.140
<v Speaker 1>What'd you write here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

761
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:19.180
<v Speaker 1>keep in mind 1 million plus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

762
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Over a million people were watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegally on twitch,</v>

763
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.343
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a picture of twitch staff was in </v>

764
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:30.710
<v Speaker 1>the illegal room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for twitch staff for watching.</v>

765
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:31.933
<v Speaker 1>They made this a press release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we were trying as hard as we could </v>

766
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 1>to remove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that is crazy revenue,</v>

767
00:42:39.381 --> 00:42:40.214
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta also remember those </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably such crazy costs and sane cost </v>

768
00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:47.390
<v Speaker 1>in putting it together and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me put it this way.</v>

769
00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.360
<v Speaker 1>We were considering doing a show at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ace theater,</v>

770
00:42:50.361 --> 00:42:51.194
<v Speaker 1>which we never did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cost of paying the venue alone </v>

771
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.860
<v Speaker 1>was like close to 50 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>

772
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.250
<v Speaker 1>And this was a crazy event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

773
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of like really professional.</v>

774
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.830
<v Speaker 1>$10,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>may sound like a lot,</v>

775
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.250
<v Speaker 1>but considering how many people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved and the.</v>

776
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:13.370
<v Speaker 1>And I mean Logan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul and Ksi are super rich.</v>

777
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 1>So getting $2,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a single payday sounds good.</v>

778
00:43:17.571 --> 00:43:20.720
<v Speaker 1>But the scope of what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

779
00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.940
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like that much money.</v>

780
00:43:22.941 --> 00:43:23.774
<v Speaker 1>When you think about mayweather and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor Mayweather got paid like </v>

781
00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:29.600
<v Speaker 1>$300,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>

782
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:31.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Was it 300 million?</v>

783
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I.</v>

784
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

785
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:35.990
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Official figure.</v>

786
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:37.940
<v Speaker 1>It's speculated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>300.</v>

787
00:43:37.941 --> 00:43:42.320
<v Speaker 1>So mayweather made $300.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Million and Mcgregor get made a $100.</v>

788
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Like how the fuck was that big of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference of money?</v>

789
00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.940
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

790
00:43:46.941 --> 00:43:48.320
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so much more.</v>

791
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:50.370
<v Speaker 1>That was really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>

792
00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:52.640
<v Speaker 1>If I had the guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they had sponsors and so</v>

793
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I guess that Ksi and Logan Paul each </v>
<v Speaker 1>made like,</v>

794
00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know that they each made $5</v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

795
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:00.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there was that much money </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

796
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>

797
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Because the Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul definitely made a good amount.</v>

798
00:44:07.401 --> 00:44:08.900
<v Speaker 1>They're fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fine.</v>

799
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:09.763
<v Speaker 1>They made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made enough money to buy a house </v>

800
00:44:10.761 --> 00:44:12.380
<v Speaker 1>with cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was.</v>

801
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Dave made something cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

802
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:15.223
<v Speaker 1>GotTa give it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here I want to do them so much time </v>

803
00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:19.190
<v Speaker 1>to organize the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

804
00:44:19.191 --> 00:44:21.740
<v Speaker 1>the training's not really amazing work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

805
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

806
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.840
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The training,</v>

807
00:44:23.841 --> 00:44:26.450
<v Speaker 1>the promotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like this whole narrative.</v>

808
00:44:26.451 --> 00:44:27.560
<v Speaker 1>They were sewing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

809
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:28.423
<v Speaker 1>well I think the peripheral hype was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really beneficial for them to like all </v>

810
00:44:33.301 --> 00:44:34.950
<v Speaker 1>their videos and everything.</v>

811
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:38.220
<v Speaker 1>We're getting way more views than usual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

812
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:42.810
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of this next level of logging </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're creating like this crazy,</v>

813
00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:44.490
<v Speaker 1>like real draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

814
00:44:44.491 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 1>it was extremely orchestrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are best friends.</v>

815
00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:49.440
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're straight up butter,</v>

816
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:50.221
<v Speaker 1>garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>garlic,</v>

817
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:53.160
<v Speaker 1>saucing each other reaching around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Double Hand Job Right now.</v>

818
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satisfying.</v>

819
00:44:54.631 --> 00:44:59.631
<v Speaker 1>They're insatiable hunger before they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine if they what narrowed.</v>

820
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

821
00:45:04.471 --> 00:45:05.304
<v Speaker 1>You know that Ksi narrowed his asshole </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Logan Paul ate that ass clean by </v>

822
00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.870
<v Speaker 1>insatiable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insatiable hunger.</v>

823
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.530
<v Speaker 1>That is the best state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the title.</v>

824
00:45:16.531 --> 00:45:18.180
<v Speaker 1>What was the title of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

825
00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:21.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the title of that video?</v>

826
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Because I feel like I can't forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

827
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.220
<v Speaker 1>scroll up you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna,</v>

828
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.850
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna rewind here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A relieved of caulk hunger.</v>

829
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.060
<v Speaker 1>So they were relieved of their cock </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger for each other.</v>

830
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:39.283
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you teach a language </v>
<v Speaker 1>where like teaching you how to use this </v>

831
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:43.180
<v Speaker 1>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that that's,</v>

832
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.670
<v Speaker 1>that phrase has got to live in infamy on</v>
<v Speaker 1>relieved of caulk hunger.</v>

833
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.613
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think like not only was it about </v>

834
00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:53.124
<v Speaker 1>their payday from this single fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everything around it was so hyped </v>

835
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 1>and so big that it was greatly to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit.</v>

836
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Are you being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we say,</v>

837
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:06.150
<v Speaker 1>well we're an actual results for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

838
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting there.</v>

839
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:15.120
<v Speaker 1>So mayweather versus macgregor just for </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison.</v>

840
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Four point 4 million paper view buyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

841
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:20.993
<v Speaker 1>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you consider that the </v>

842
00:46:22.441 --> 00:46:27.441
<v Speaker 1>purchase price of that was $100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That equals 440 million.</v>

843
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:31.463
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't St.</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was glued to the whole Vegas </v>

844
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:36.930
<v Speaker 1>was about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Defy actually was really weird.</v>

845
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 1>We were playing blackjack and the hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock and,</v>

846
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.140
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a weird,</v>

847
00:46:42.141 --> 00:46:42.974
<v Speaker 1>weird thing where only certain hotels </v>
<v Speaker 1>had the license to play it even though </v>

848
00:46:45.841 --> 00:46:46.680
<v Speaker 1>you can just buy it.</v>

849
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I find that so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could go play and watch it on all the</v>

850
00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:54.510
<v Speaker 1>therapies and found out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

851
00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:57.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin's bodyguard had his brother,</v>

852
00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.420
<v Speaker 1>he had his cell phone on the living room</v>
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>

853
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.420
<v Speaker 1>live streaming on instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Instagram,</v>

854
00:47:03.421 --> 00:47:04.254
<v Speaker 1>his TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we were watching a livestream of </v>

855
00:47:06.751 --> 00:47:07.760
<v Speaker 1>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>

856
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:12.810
<v Speaker 1>of a recording of a TV and then random </v>
<v Speaker 1>livestream ended up having like 10,000</v>

857
00:47:12.811 --> 00:47:13.644
<v Speaker 1>viewers by the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when we found out that it wasn't a </v>

858
00:47:15.361 --> 00:47:16.194
<v Speaker 1>whole team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were thousands of people doing </v>

859
00:47:17.941 --> 00:47:18.361
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

860
00:47:18.361 --> 00:47:19.194
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of hard to take it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like there was a huge crowd behind </v>

861
00:47:22.681 --> 00:47:23.514
<v Speaker 1>us to just to watch on this little </v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone because you couldn't find it </v>

862
00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well anyway,</v>

863
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.823
<v Speaker 1>that's 440 and I just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked it up again that four point $4 </v>

864
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.170
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just domestic,</v>

865
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:36.004
<v Speaker 1>that's just us paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So overseas it's probably another </v>

866
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:39.933
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

867
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:46.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's the live tickets generated $55</v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

868
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:46.984
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck were they charging people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think ringside tickets were probably </v>

869
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:51.870
<v Speaker 1>thousands of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tens of thousands.</v>

870
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Probably total estimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought in $600.</v>

871
00:47:56.141 --> 00:48:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Million to do that as close to a billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars from one five crazy.</v>

872
00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:01.650
<v Speaker 1>So Mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>

873
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.000
<v Speaker 1>got $300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million mcgregor paid 100 million.</v>

874
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I was just really curious because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why?</v>

875
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean like four point four verse 800 is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big difference,</v>

876
00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:13.270
<v Speaker 1>but I mean having a million live viewers</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pretty significant,</v>

877
00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:17.440
<v Speaker 1>but I guess at 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$10 makes a big difference.</v>

878
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little comparison there.</v>

879
00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:23.740
<v Speaker 1>They were very far from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the most popular,</v>

880
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.410
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their credit that's a huge event.</v>

881
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.370
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about like the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>live event of all time.</v>

882
00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:36.190
<v Speaker 1>So I just thought it was interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare those two events.</v>

883
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Now let's talk about that fight itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shall We?</v>

884
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>J dot Paul,</v>

885
00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:45.130
<v Speaker 1>one in the fifth round out of six via a </v>
<v Speaker 1>technical knockout.</v>

886
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:47.730
<v Speaker 1>They ended it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what,</v>

887
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:52.770
<v Speaker 1>even though Jake Paul did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it seems that the most entertaining</v>

888
00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:53.914
<v Speaker 1>and talked about moment of the night was</v>
<v Speaker 1>this image of Jake Paul with a bloody </v>

889
00:48:57.821 --> 00:49:01.000
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So shout out to comedy shorts Gamer.</v>

890
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:02.500
<v Speaker 1>He looked dazed and confused.</v>

891
00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.043
<v Speaker 9>Hmm.</v>

892
00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:06.923
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a lot of people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter profiles on like a lot of </v>

893
00:49:09.791 --> 00:49:11.460
<v Speaker 1>avatars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

894
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.353
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to take too much pride and </v>

895
00:49:13.181 --> 00:49:14.380
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fine by the way.</v>

896
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:16.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one,</v>

897
00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:18.430
<v Speaker 1>he's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just pretty,</v>

898
00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.230
<v Speaker 1>pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

899
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was apparently,</v>

900
00:49:22.511 --> 00:49:27.511
<v Speaker 1>that was the highlight of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it doesn't say much.</v>

901
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Here's a video of Jake Paul being </v>
<v Speaker 1>punched in the face 40 times.</v>

902
00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:35.890
<v Speaker 1>They've been super strict on the copper </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

903
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:40.891
<v Speaker 1>So I guess this one is editorial enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here you go.</v>

904
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.550
<v Speaker 1>How many times was Jake Paul punched in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face?</v>

905
00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:49.280
<v Speaker 1>People really hate Jake Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

906
00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:50.400
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

907
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:53.573
<v Speaker 9>right.</v>

908
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people allowing them to kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like anyway,</v>

909
00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:03.940
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't than just telling us 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just it is now at Lingq.</v>

910
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how many million?</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 million a lot,</v>

911
00:50:08.201 --> 00:50:09.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to say he's,</v>

912
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:11.920
<v Speaker 1>he's more likable than Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

913
00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:12.491
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

914
00:50:12.491 --> 00:50:14.060
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was a guest on our,</v>

915
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:15.520
<v Speaker 1>on our show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

916
00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:16.873
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

917
00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.733
<v Speaker 1>he came out looking much better and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think everyone had a sense of </v>

918
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:24.890
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

919
00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's watch him get back for and said,</v>

920
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:30.260
<v Speaker 1>let us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch him get punched in the face.</v>

921
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:37.880
<v Speaker 6>Definitely landings from solid punches.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A veggie definitely land.</v>

922
00:50:40.221 --> 00:50:45.221
<v Speaker 6>It's installed punches now as I've heard</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is jake.</v>

923
00:50:45.931 --> 00:50:50.160
<v Speaker 6>Paul was significantly larger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>taller,</v>

924
00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:51.610
<v Speaker 6>taller,</v>
<v Speaker 6>longer,</v>

925
00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:54.680
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was not really a fair match up by,</v>

926
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.240
<v Speaker 6>by uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>definitely.</v>

927
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.560
<v Speaker 6>Apparently Jake Paul was</v>

928
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.750
<v Speaker 1>forced to slouch down because at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>height difference in the size difference</v>

929
00:51:04.751 --> 00:51:07.120
<v Speaker 1>was so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>

930
00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:08.253

1047
00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now there is a prelude to this.</v>

1048
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1049
00:58:05.621 --> 00:58:06.454
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say it was a tie by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fight was a tie between Logan and k </v>

1050
00:58:09.921 --> 00:58:12.670
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for if you don't know,</v>

1051
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:13.743
<v Speaker 1>is extremely rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the rarest outcomes for a boxing </v>

1052
00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:20.770
<v Speaker 1>match extra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost unheard of.</v>

1053
00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:23.253
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people are saying that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome was rig to help hype up their </v>

1054
00:58:29.111 --> 00:58:33.280
<v Speaker 1>second match and to that I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really think they would do that?</v>

1055
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:38.200
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not.</v>

1056
00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:39.643
<v Speaker 1>Well that is an interesting claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>because as far as I could tell that </v>

1057
00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:46.330
<v Speaker 1>would be a pretty serious crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1058
00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:50.120
<v Speaker 1>to fix a large sporting event like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

1059
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.320
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Would they do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1061
00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:54.403
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1062
00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I personally found the outcome pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointed.</v>

1063
00:58:59.121 --> 00:58:59.954
<v Speaker 1>I would've been more excited if somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants because then there's an underdog </v>

1064
00:59:02.721 --> 00:59:07.190
<v Speaker 1>story going into the next fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then that kind of makes it more real</v>

1065
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:09.770
<v Speaker 1>because they also want like the better </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1066
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Well I think they thought the tie was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the better store.</v>

1067
00:59:13.570 --> 00:59:15.170
<v Speaker 1>You'd think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1068
00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean the all the bookies one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of bullshit is that?</v>

1069
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people bet on a tie the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

1070
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:26.690
<v Speaker 1>is that like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1071
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty Shady.</v>

1072
00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty shady.</v>

1073
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:33.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are people going to be justice hype for </v>

1074
00:59:34.881 --> 00:59:37.400
<v Speaker 1>the second fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't think so because in,</v>

1075
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:39.110
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all it's a tie.</v>

1076
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone's disappointed by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly.</v>

1077
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.313
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone's kind of over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the logan and ksi both made </v>

1078
00:59:46.401 --> 00:59:48.200
<v Speaker 1>videos being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a great fight.</v>

1079
00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I respect him so much and this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>facade of being like,</v>

1080
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:53.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to eat your children or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1081
00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classical economics to your children.</v>

1082
00:59:56.841 --> 00:59:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Praise be to Allah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Tyson.</v>

1083
00:59:59.841 --> 01:00:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can fucking sell a fight like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson,</v>

1084
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>he wants said to an opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to eat your children.</v>

1085
01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Praise be to Allah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1086
01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.293
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I'm better you sell </v>

1087
01:00:09.101 --> 01:00:09.934
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that,</v>

1088
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so back to.</v>

1089
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:17.900
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that the second one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be as high because I think the,</v>

1090
01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the illusion is busted that they</v>

1091
01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>hate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

1092
01:00:21.771 --> 01:00:22.604
<v Speaker 1>I'll be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be there and I'll tell you </v>

1093
01:00:23.841 --> 01:00:24.674
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to send Joey Salads on a live </v>

1094
01:00:28.131 --> 01:00:30.830
<v Speaker 1>report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want him to live stream it.</v>

1095
01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.720
<v Speaker 1>We haven't asked you that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1096
01:00:34.721 --> 01:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got to do meal,</v>

1097
01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

1098
01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>that same day prank invasion tweets at </v>

<v Speaker 1>enjoying ourselves having a great </v>

1100
01:00:45.791 --> 01:00:48.520
<v Speaker 1>vacation and this honestly just made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>even better for me.</v>

1101
01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I had a blast with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1102
01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:55.210
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for full disclosure,</v>

1103
01:00:55.211 --> 01:00:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I was on the phone with frank invasion </v>
<v Speaker 1>now on the phone,</v>

1104
01:00:57.401 --> 01:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>but I was tweeting with him in dms and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1105
01:01:00.251 --> 01:01:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to do a know your main,</v>

1106

<v Speaker 1>to talk to you and do a segment with you</v>

1107
01:01:05.381 --> 01:01:06.214
<v Speaker 1>because I mean you're been a consistent </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the show for so long and we </v>

1108
01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>caught him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's becoming,</v>

1109
01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.053
<v Speaker 1>starting to become self aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like with his recent kissing </v>

1110
01:01:16.091 --> 01:01:16.924
<v Speaker 1>pranks and then he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we agreed that we would do it </v>

1111
01:01:20.701 --> 01:01:23.620
<v Speaker 1>and he ghosted out on us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fine.</v>

1112
01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.840
<v Speaker 1>But then a couple days later he tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 1>this at me.</v>

1113
01:01:25.841 --> 01:01:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I challenged h three h three productions</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a fight.</v>

1114

1206
01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.230
<v Speaker 1>I want to rent a venue.</v>

1207

<v Speaker 1>big deal,</v>

1212
01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:48.390
<v Speaker 1>sponsorship that I've always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking after.</v>

1213
01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.513
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to talk about this Chinese </v>

1214
01:06:52.681 --> 01:06:54.570
<v Speaker 1>people's story before we move on to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoe?</v>

1215
01:06:54.571 --> 01:06:55.404
<v Speaker 1>Nice story</v>

1216
01:06:56.970 --> 01:06:58.320
<v Speaker 8>and what kind of move on to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nice.</v>

1217
01:06:59.130 --> 01:06:59.963
<v Speaker 1>I love this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe we can talk about it next </v>

1218
01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.520
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

1219
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Apparently a Chinese company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Chinese couple.</v>

1220
01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.133
<v Speaker 1>Apparently sex education is so poor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China that a couple was trying to </v>

1221
01:07:10.961 --> 01:07:15.400
<v Speaker 1>conceive for four years and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>having anal sex the whole time.</v>

1222
01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>

1223
01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:22.710
<v Speaker 8>So they were trying to conceive and then</v>
<v Speaker 8>it wasn't working and they went to see a</v>

1224
01:07:22.711 --> 01:07:27.711
<v Speaker 8>doctor and the lady said every time they</v>
<v Speaker 8>have sex it's usually painful.</v>

1225
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:30.780
<v Speaker 8>So she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let me examine you.</v>

1226
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.673
<v Speaker 8>Like why is it painful for four years?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then if it turns out they </v>

1227
01:07:39.061 --> 01:07:43.860
<v Speaker 8>mistakenly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've been having anal intercourse.</v>

1228
01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:46.013
<v Speaker 1>Lou gave the couple a sex education </v>
<v Speaker 1>handbook and within months the woman </v>

1229
01:07:49.261 --> 01:07:53.220
<v Speaker 1>became pregnant to show their </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciation.</v>

1230
01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:57.660
<v Speaker 1>They sent the doctor a live hand and 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs as a gift.</v>

1231
01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:02.383
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of humans as these really </v>

1232
01:08:03.261 --> 01:08:04.640
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved creatures,</v>

1233
01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:05.653
<v Speaker 1>but when you go out to the rural rural </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the world without medicine or </v>

1234
01:08:09.741 --> 01:08:10.574
<v Speaker 1>doctors or technology available were </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking each other's in the ass trying </v>

1235
01:08:13.311 --> 01:08:17.660
<v Speaker 1>to make ourselves pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1236
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:20.870
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1237
01:08:20.871 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy is just like,</v>

1238
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:22.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how,</v>

1239
01:08:23.290 --> 01:08:28.290
<v Speaker 1>that's how you get pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That blows my mind.</v>

1240
01:08:31.251 --> 01:08:34.910
<v Speaker 1>The two human beings can have anal sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get pregnant.</v>

1241
01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:35.744
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're that disconnected from </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that that's how that can go </v>

1242
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:39.254
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm rally that is pretty rare to be so </v>

1243
01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:45.710
<v Speaker 1>lacking of knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not uncommon.</v>

1244
01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:46.603
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sexual education and there is not </v>

1245
01:08:50.721 --> 01:08:54.350
<v Speaker 1>really sensing enough yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1246
01:08:54.351 --> 01:08:57.860
<v Speaker 1>The big takeaway that was interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me is that in rural China,</v>

1247
01:08:58.070 --> 01:09:02.720
<v Speaker 1>apparently sex education is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm all,</v>

1248
01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:04.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't vote on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's disappointing.</v>

1249
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I opened the thread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pole,</v>

1250
01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:09.940
<v Speaker 1>just just show me the damn results out.</v>

1251
01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Apparently sex education in China is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor that people are out there having,</v>

1252
01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting loads in each other to </v>

1253
01:09:16.821 --> 01:09:19.490
<v Speaker 1>buttholes trying to shoot out a baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally.</v>

1254
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So now is the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway.</v>

1255
01:09:22.131 --> 01:09:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got that out of the way.</v>

1256
01:09:23.281 --> 01:09:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's move on a little shoe and I says a</v>

1257
01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:30.740
<v Speaker 1>fucking lunatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And other nodes we mentioned.</v>

1258
01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:31.583
<v Speaker 1>Should I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so briefly in our last episode so </v>

1259
01:09:34.431 --> 01:09:35.264
<v Speaker 1>briefly and in fact I want to show you </v>
<v Speaker 1>the video so you can see how brief it </v>

1260
01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:41.294
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so that you can understand the </v>

1261
01:09:43.311 --> 01:09:47.000
<v Speaker 1>reaction he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how insane it is.</v>

1262
01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm shoe.</v>

1263
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

1264
01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.191
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a legend.</v>

1265
01:09:52.191 --> 01:09:56.090
<v Speaker 1>He eats you yoder and chases alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he made,</v>

1266
01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.160
<v Speaker 1>he made a asm art eating chips video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just never showed it by the way.</v>

1267
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1268
01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:14.510
<v Speaker 1>very light mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we went into the comments section,</v>

1269
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:16.263
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy strap up because this is a wild </v>

1270
01:10:20.001 --> 01:10:21.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My dudes.</v>

1271
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:23.263
<v Speaker 1>So apparently shooting ice has like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>different accounts and he switches </v>

1272
01:10:27.741 --> 01:10:28.574
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he thinks that we don't </v>

1273
01:10:32.571 --> 01:10:33.404
<v Speaker 1>know that it's him because they all have</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name in the title or maybe he </v>

1274
01:10:35.421 --> 01:10:38.930
<v Speaker 1>switched into other accounts to upvote </v>

<v Speaker 1>I saw it really little touch.</v>

1422
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:25.750

<v Speaker 1>I don't want to show it here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

1429
01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:50.660
<v Speaker 1>A brothel instead of having human sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolls.</v>

1430
01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:55.040
<v Speaker 1>That sound bad set of having humans you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can have sex with.</v>

1431
01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.700
<v Speaker 1>They have sex dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Realistic sex dolls.</v>

1432
01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.510
<v Speaker 1>We have a photo of the adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't we?</v>

1433
01:19:00.511 --> 01:19:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Dan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1434
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Where are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dogs.</v>

1435
01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:05.773
<v Speaker 1>I've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to go.</v>

1436
01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:07.573
<v Speaker 1>So if you're wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm talking about here is some of </v>

1437
01:19:10.071 --> 01:19:10.904
<v Speaker 1>the choices are adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a choice of ana who was </v>

1438
01:19:16.641 --> 01:19:20.690
<v Speaker 1>busty as who can play and see huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very busty,</v>

1439
01:19:20.691 --> 01:19:21.524
<v Speaker 1>romantic and spontaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't not sure how a doll is </v>

1440
01:19:24.531 --> 01:19:25.370
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous.</v>

1441
01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:28.333
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a doll is pretty much the </v>

1442
01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.090
<v Speaker 1>opposite of spontaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's possible.</v>

1443
01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:35.910
<v Speaker 1>As predictable as it get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Erica,</v>

1444
01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:40.820
<v Speaker 1>who's a young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was gorgeous and sweet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You've got jasmine exotic faced angel.</v>

1447
01:19:48.891 --> 01:19:53.480
<v Speaker 1>That just means she's black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exotic paste angel.</v>

1448
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scarlet the absolute American dream.</v>

1449
01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing more American than butter.</v>

1450
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Garlic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are we eating John Snyder?</v>

1451
01:20:07.831 --> 01:20:08.820
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1452
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:10.583
<v Speaker 1>And Yuki submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all dogs are by definition </v>

1453
01:20:15.241 --> 01:20:16.074
<v Speaker 1>submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally cannot help but be </v>

1454
01:20:18.601 --> 01:20:20.130
<v Speaker 1>submissive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent.</v>

1455
01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Not when I'm done with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And playful.</v>

1456
01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.590
<v Speaker 1>So this is some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is some wild shit.</v>

1457
01:20:28.591 --> 01:20:29.424
<v Speaker 1>You guys that we're talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you choose what you want to fuck </v>

1458
01:20:32.821 --> 01:20:33.654
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now their rate and membership thing </v>

1459
01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:36.290
<v Speaker 1>cracked me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1460
01:20:36.970 --> 01:20:37.803
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could probably fund a real </v>

1461
01:20:39.631 --> 01:20:44.631
<v Speaker 1>prostitute for this price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for half an hour you get one doll for</v>

1462
01:20:45.181 --> 01:20:49.170
<v Speaker 1>80 bucks and two dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you need to dolls?</v>

1463
01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:51.810
<v Speaker 1>They're not living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine taking the boat.</v>

1464
01:20:51.811 --> 01:20:55.490
<v Speaker 1>They're lifeless heads and like how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy your own dog.</v>

1465
01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I think those real ones actually are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like thousands.</v>

1466
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:02.083
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1467
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you really need a real one at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point?</v>

1468
01:21:04.771 --> 01:21:06.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like Ian said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1469
01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:08.340
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was researching at 4,000</v>

1470
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:10.703
<v Speaker 1>really start and really I didn't ask you</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] wasn't part of our research </v>

1471
01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:19.410
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

1472
01:21:19.411 --> 01:21:22.350
<v Speaker 1>You can have a threesome with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in 180.</v>

1473
01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:24.570
<v Speaker 1>No discount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just double the price.</v>

1474
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I know I could double the price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a discount.</v>

1475
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.350
<v Speaker 1>You can get them for a half hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1476
01:21:31.351 --> 01:21:32.700
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four hours.</v>

1477
01:21:32.701 --> 01:21:35.700
<v Speaker 1>They have a grand opening in like a $10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1478
01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying,</v>

1479
01:21:36.571 --> 01:21:37.530
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a discount.</v>

1480
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Grand opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five percent off the price.</v>

1481
01:21:40.441 --> 01:21:41.274
<v Speaker 1>Now guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use your imagination and </v>

1482
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:43.254
<v Speaker 1>understand that fucking the same fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>doll as many men before you gets a </v>

1483
01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:50.970
<v Speaker 1>little strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's true of women,</v>

1484
01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:53.970
<v Speaker 1>but there are biological creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shower,</v>

1485
01:21:53.971 --> 01:21:57.090
<v Speaker 1>they walk around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1486
01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll know that fake vagina is going to </v>

1487
01:22:00.211 --> 01:22:02.250
<v Speaker 1>get blasted out after like a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

1488
01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.084
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I guess you get the mileage out of </v>

1489
01:22:04.951 --> 01:22:06.310
<v Speaker 1>it after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1490
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:07.223
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human body is regenerative as the </v>

1491
01:22:10.671 --> 01:22:15.671
<v Speaker 1>very beautiful ability of rejuvenating </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and healing itself.</v>

1492
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:21.500
<v Speaker 1>But this is not a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is going to get the last it out</v>

1493
01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.650
<v Speaker 1>wide tongue me after probably 100 times.</v>

1494
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:28.743
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that's how the prices sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent Yuki is going to get blasted </v>

1495
01:22:35.230 --> 01:22:39.010
<v Speaker 1>out anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1496
01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.090
<v Speaker 1>I guess they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1497
01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:43.870
<v Speaker 1>they calculate that based on the mileage</v>
<v Speaker 1>they expect to get right now.</v>

1498
01:22:43.871 --> 01:22:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Here's a great little twist on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1499
01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:51.880
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prostitution association is fighting</v>

1500
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:56.650
<v Speaker 1>back because they're afraid this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to cut into their market.</v>

1501
01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I w I wonder how much it is for real </v>

1502
01:23:00.671 --> 01:23:01.880
<v Speaker 1>prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see that.</v>

1503
01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Their rate card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably more $80</v>

1504
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:10.270
<v Speaker 9>for half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And do you have any information on that?</v>

1505
01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:16.770
<v Speaker 9>Are you asking Ian specifically calls?</v>
<v Speaker 9>He said so on your own.</v>

1506
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.950
<v Speaker 9>I think 80 would be quite cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that would be like a blow job or</v>

1507
01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:24.813
<v Speaker 9>something.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't think that would be the full </v>

1508
01:23:26.171 --> 01:23:27.130
<v Speaker 9>Monte,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1509
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:28.863
<v Speaker 9>So you save a couple bucks and you fuck </v>
<v Speaker 9>a doll that had punched his Dick's had </v>

1510
01:23:31.391 --> 01:23:32.224
<v Speaker 9>been in.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I wonder if they have insatiable hunger </v>

1511
01:23:36.101 --> 01:23:39.460
<v Speaker 9>for coc.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>

1512
01:23:39.730 --> 01:23:40.563
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

1513
01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:45.280
<v Speaker 9>the people who own the dol said,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1514
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.640
<v Speaker 9>the doll that could grow will be ready </v>
<v Speaker 9>and waiting in your room.</v>

1515
01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:53.290
<v Speaker 9>We do encourage the use of condoms just </v>
<v Speaker 9>because we don't want people to.</v>

1516
01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:54.693
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's still a chance of getting a </v>

1517
01:23:55.661 --> 01:23:57.800
<v Speaker 9>sexual disease.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Can you like you like that?</v>

1518
01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:02.900
<v Speaker 9>He gave him a fuck up a lifeless doll,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not a condom these days.</v>

1519
01:24:04.530 --> 01:24:06.320
<v Speaker 9>Just sanitize the gauges,</v>
<v Speaker 9>clean it,</v>

<v Speaker 9>man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I am not.</v>

1521
01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.470
<v Speaker 9>When they don't want the responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You've seen that room.</v>

1522
01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:15.510
<v Speaker 9>I trucked often for the sperm test.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Imagine,</v>

1523
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:17.103
<v Speaker 9>imagine it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And then you fuck this doll that other </v>

<v Speaker 9>with,</v>
<v Speaker 9>excuse me.</v>

1526
01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:28.720
<v Speaker 9>And then so the prostitution </v>
<v Speaker 9>association,</v>

1527
01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.890
<v Speaker 9>the Association of sex professionals </v>
<v Speaker 9>strikes back.</v>

1528
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:38.910
<v Speaker 9>They set quote the sex affection of a </v>
<v Speaker 9>person cannot be provided by a doll.</v>

1529
01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:46.500
<v Speaker 9>You would say that they are different </v>
<v Speaker 9>and compatible services.</v>

1530
01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:52.060
<v Speaker 1>They do not communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do not listen to you or Koresh you.</v>

1531
01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.073
<v Speaker 1>They do not come for you or look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do not give you their opinion or </v>

1532
01:24:56.531 --> 01:24:57.970
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't ask for your opinion.</v>

1533
01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:00.123
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do not give you their opinion or </v>

1534
01:25:02.951 --> 01:25:06.490
<v Speaker 1>drink a glass of champagne with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Champagne.</v>

1535
01:25:08.210 --> 01:25:09.043
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1536
01:25:10.190 --> 01:25:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't ask for A.</v>

1537
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I didn't getting all jacked up on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do not give.</v>

1538
01:25:20.150 --> 01:25:20.983
<v Speaker 1>Thank you Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do not give you their opinion or </v>

1539
01:25:22.791 --> 01:25:23.624
<v Speaker 1>drink a glass of champagne with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the members also said it's </v>

1540
01:25:25.641 --> 01:25:29.810
<v Speaker 1>another strategy of the patriarchy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>presents us as objects without rights.</v>

1541
01:25:29.811 --> 01:25:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Are souls a privilege of the wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

1542
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:34.753
<v Speaker 1>That's funny because in a way isn't any </v>
<v Speaker 1>better for a woman more accessible like </v>

1543
01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:44.330
<v Speaker 1>to let men do whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We to an object instead of a person.</v>

1544
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:45.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that their perspective is that </v>

1545
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:48.703
<v Speaker 1>it's female empowerment in that you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not telling a woman what she can </v>

1546
01:25:51.801 --> 01:25:52.634
<v Speaker 1>or cannot do with their body because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like prostitution is outlawed a lot of </v>

1547
01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:56.684
<v Speaker 1>places and there's a lot of women that </v>
<v Speaker 1>do want to make their living that way </v>

1548
01:25:59.511 --> 01:25:59.991
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1549
01:25:59.991 --> 01:26:02.390
<v Speaker 1>don't tell me what to do with my body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's right,</v>

1550
01:26:02.391 --> 01:26:06.170
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to throw these sweet,</v>

1551
01:26:06.171 --> 01:26:11.171
<v Speaker 1>innocent submissive dollars under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bus is just low at the level below.</v>

1552
01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.460
<v Speaker 1>They also added,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you realize that you're fucking adult</v>

1553
01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:23.293
<v Speaker 1>where didn't add added up and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really gross and you have to use a </v>

1554
01:26:25.631 --> 01:26:28.610
<v Speaker 1>condom with that anyway because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get some dudes on your deck.</v>

1555
01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:34.470
<v Speaker 1>That was their best counterpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1556
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:35.323
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1557
01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:36.693
<v Speaker 1>They had a video showing how the build </v>
<v Speaker 1>though those dollars and it looked like </v>

1558
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:40.663

<v Speaker 1>It was basically a direct parody of </v>

1618
01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:10.320
<v Speaker 1>one of the classiest moments in American</v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

1619
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:13.110
<v Speaker 1>recent American history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as you know,</v>

1620
01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:15.150
<v Speaker 1>the country is so politically divided.</v>

1621
01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:17.430
<v Speaker 1>It bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It bothers most people frankly.</v>

1622
01:30:17.431 --> 01:30:18.264
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of people did drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Koolaid on either side and it's </v>

1623
01:30:22.081 --> 01:30:22.914
<v Speaker 1>really cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who watches CNN everyday and who </v>

1624
01:30:24.751 --> 01:30:28.170
<v Speaker 1>watches Fox News every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your team line.</v>

1625
01:30:28.171 --> 01:30:29.004
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now John Mccain was a conservative </v>

1626
01:30:30.811 --> 01:30:34.560
<v Speaker 1>through and through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a Fox News man and the people,</v>

1627
01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:39.030
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Bruno didn't like Obama.</v>

1628
01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:41.490
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of weird conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories about him.</v>

1629
01:30:41.491 --> 01:30:43.950
<v Speaker 1>One of which perpetrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1630
01:30:43.951 --> 01:30:47.340
<v Speaker 1>of our current president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably the dumbest.</v>

1631
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:48.263
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things to say about </v>

1632
01:30:48.931 --> 01:30:50.430
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get into it,</v>

1633
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:51.563
<v Speaker 1>but accusing Obama of not being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>American citizen and is probably the </v>

1634
01:30:55.801 --> 01:30:56.634
<v Speaker 1>dumbest and the most insidious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat out insane lie I've ever heard of </v>

1635
01:31:00.661 --> 01:31:02.110
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1636
01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:07.350
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of the people bought into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the women at the rally,</v>

1637
01:31:07.351 --> 01:31:08.184
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it's happened several times </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a couple of times where they </v>

1638
01:31:10.081 --> 01:31:12.240
<v Speaker 1>say who Obama is.</v>

1639
01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.073
<v Speaker 1>An Arab obviously implying a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not implying that Arabs can't be good </v>

1640
01:31:18.481 --> 01:31:19.314
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but John Mccain read between the lines </v>

1641
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:26.430
<v Speaker 1>being you'll see for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically this one,</v>

1642
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:27.743
<v Speaker 1>the classiest moment in my opinion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent American history where he went </v>

1643
01:31:32.581 --> 01:31:36.180
<v Speaker 1>against the grain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He risked his own ass.</v>

1644
01:31:36.930 --> 01:31:38.260
<v Speaker 1>He's in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1645
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:41.720
<v Speaker 1>a town hall meeting with these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are thirsty,</v>

1646
01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:42.573
<v Speaker 1>bloodthirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just fucking stopped him in his </v>

1647
01:31:44.461 --> 01:31:45.390
<v Speaker 1>tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said no,</v>

1648
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:46.343
<v Speaker 1>and he knew even gets booed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucking turned on him for actually </v>

1649
01:31:50.761 --> 01:31:52.760
<v Speaker 1>standing up for his values and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1650
01:31:52.761 --> 01:31:54.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and speaking some,</v>

1651
01:31:54.230 --> 01:31:58.350
<v Speaker 1>some sanity and the part that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>pisses me off.</v>

1652
01:31:58.351 --> 01:31:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me show you the clip,</v>

1653
01:31:59.471 --> 01:32:00.304
<v Speaker 1>but actually now that this fucking class</v>
<v Speaker 1>act and true American hero has passed </v>

1654
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:06.183
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1655
01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people</v>

1656
01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.013
<v Speaker 1>on the left who I politically are </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be my political allies </v>

1657
01:32:15.291 --> 01:32:17.570
<v Speaker 1>because I am very left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very liberal person.</v>

1658
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Say that all the time are eviscerating </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Mccain for this clip to people that</v>

1659
01:32:26.031 --> 01:32:29.630
<v Speaker 1>he's reaching out to across the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1660
01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:31.401
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1661
01:32:31.401 --> 01:32:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Lemme let's watch the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1662
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just so sad and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sad.</v>

1663
01:32:36.771 --> 01:32:37.604
<v Speaker 1>Let me play you this.</v>

1664
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.090
<v Speaker 4>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1665
01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:44.200
<v Speaker 4>we're scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're scared of an Obama presidency.</v>

1666
01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:48.573
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be present United States and </v>

1667
01:32:51.491 --> 01:32:53.800
<v Speaker 4>obviously I do not want central Obama to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

1668
01:32:54.370 --> 01:32:56.890
<v Speaker 4>but I have to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to tell you,</v>

1669
01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:57.833
<v Speaker 4>he is a decent person and a person that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you do not have to be scared as the </v>

1670
01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:04.983
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I hear them turn on him and I just </v>

1671
01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:11.560
<v Speaker 4>now look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I didn't think I wouldn't be one heck</v>

1672
01:33:11.561 --> 01:33:13.720
<v Speaker 4>of a lot better president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be running.</v>

1673
01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:15.400
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the point.</v>

1674
01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:16.413
<v Speaker 4>That's excellent.</v>

1675
01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Can hear the crowds turn on him when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to insinuate he's a decent guy.</v>

1676
01:33:20.601 --> 01:33:23.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be scared of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1677
01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.480
<v Speaker 1>how messed up is our country that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that simple insinuation,</v>

1678
01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:29.810
<v Speaker 1>he is not the antichrist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be scared of him.</v>

1679
01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:31.460
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good person.</v>

1680
01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1681
01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second part is the part that people </v>

1682
01:33:40.711 --> 01:33:41.550
<v Speaker 1>are outraged about.</v>

1683
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:46.610
<v Speaker 4>To the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to ask you a question.</v>

1684
01:33:46.670 --> 01:33:47.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1691
01:34:04.730 --> 01:34:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Well even I can't trust Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had read about him and he's not.</v>

1709
01:35:02.631 --> 01:35:05.300
<v Speaker 1>an Arab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a decent family man as citizen.</v>

01:35:34.101 --> 01:35:34.934
<v Speaker 1>cross to make a bridge of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of class and dignity that doesn't seem </v>

<v Speaker 1>we disagree,</v>

<v Speaker 1>trying to be submerged in when,</v>

1728
01:35:58.970 --> 01:35:59.803
<v Speaker 1>when his intention and the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he did was the exact opposite of </v>

1729
01:36:03.681 --> 01:36:05.690
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to say after his </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

1730
01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:07.213
<v Speaker 1>She said he's an Arab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her insinuation was so much more </v>

1731
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:10.970
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

1732
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:12.170
<v Speaker 1>what he's saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1733
01:36:12.171 --> 01:36:13.280
<v Speaker 1>he's not an Arab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying,</v>

1734
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:15.530
<v Speaker 1>no ma'am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even go there.</v>

1735
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Wherever it is that you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

1736
01:36:18.381 --> 01:36:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

1737
01:36:20.121 --> 01:36:22.220
<v Speaker 1>he's going off the cuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a live event.</v>

1738
01:36:22.221 --> 01:36:22.830
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1739
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:26.480
<v Speaker 1>he's in the hole with all these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to turn on him.</v>

1740
01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.130
<v Speaker 1>He's making a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1741
01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:31.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I just want to clarify that.</v>

1742
01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabs can be good people.</v>

1743
01:36:33.711 --> 01:36:36.530
<v Speaker 1>He is not an era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Arabs can be good people.</v>

1744
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:38.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1745
01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:43.120
<v Speaker 1>he shut her down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1746
01:36:43.671 --> 01:36:44.504
<v Speaker 1>I'm so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sick of fucking people like this </v>

1747
01:36:47.931 --> 01:36:50.900
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could look at this other tweet.</v>

1748
01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Someone responds to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same guy says,</v>

1749
01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:54.613
<v Speaker 1>I hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you actually take to heart the </v>

1750
01:36:56.511 --> 01:36:58.520
<v Speaker 1>idea of reading tweets without your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet,</v>

1751
01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:00.260
<v Speaker 1>from the hip assumptions getting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1752
01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I clearly said the story was racist.</v>

1753
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:09.190
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1754
01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:12.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to show them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about the guy,</v>

1755
01:37:13.810 --> 01:37:16.300
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just like,</v>

1756
01:37:16.301 --> 01:37:17.050
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude.</v>

1757
01:37:17.050 --> 01:37:17.883
<v Speaker 1>It's not even about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this sentiment echoed a lot </v>

1758
01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:25.510
<v Speaker 1>and I just think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking shame.</v>

1759
01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Like we should be honoring this like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really courageous moment of,</v>

1760
01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:32.110
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was really nice of him when</v>

1761
01:37:32.111 --> 01:37:37.111
<v Speaker 1>I saw it courageous and rest in peace to</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Mccain,</v>

1762
01:37:37.451 --> 01:37:38.284
<v Speaker 1>the last honest vestige of class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how can a guy like that even be </v>

1763
01:37:42.191 --> 01:37:43.024
<v Speaker 1>classy when the people he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach out to our viscera rating because </v>

1764
01:37:45.701 --> 01:37:49.540
<v Speaker 1>it's never enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1765
01:37:49.570 --> 01:37:51.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That made me really sad.</v>

1766
01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.730
<v Speaker 1>But I think John Mckinsey and awesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1767
01:37:56.731 --> 01:37:57.564
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1768
01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:00.993
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said in his final statement that he </v>

1769
01:38:02.441 --> 01:38:04.780
<v Speaker 1>just wants to remember it as someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that served his country.</v>

1770
01:38:05.170 --> 01:38:08.290
<v Speaker 1>So he definitely will be remembered as </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1771
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:15.950
<v Speaker 9>Hmm Rep</v>

1772
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:22.730
<v Speaker 1>and the words feel Tony from last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1773
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:24.283
<v Speaker 1>let's move it on to this footage I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to share with you guys is one of the </v>

1774
01:38:28.101 --> 01:38:32.720
<v Speaker 1>most intense and insane things I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking seen in my life.</v>

1775
01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys probably heard,</v>

1776
01:38:35.931 --> 01:38:36.764
<v Speaker 1>we covered a lot of the fires last year </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were ravaging Ventura and Santa </v>

1777
01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a fire and nor cal or.</v>

1778
01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in north cal that was </v>

1779
01:38:45.291 --> 01:38:50.291
<v Speaker 1>even bigger than last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gen savaging and destroying the state.</v>

1780
01:38:51.890 --> 01:38:52.723
<v Speaker 1>So on continues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this father and son were out hiking </v>

1781
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.943
<v Speaker 1>and it was all clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all good and they saw smoke in </v>

1782
01:38:59.931 --> 01:39:04.931
<v Speaker 1>the distance and didn't think anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it because it was pretty far away.</v>

1783
01:39:05.630 --> 01:39:06.463
<v Speaker 1>But the winds picked up and this fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>started spreading super fast and all of </v>

1784
01:39:09.831 --> 01:39:11.630
<v Speaker 1>a sudden they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got get out.</v>

1785
01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:12.980
<v Speaker 1>We should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should get outta here.</v>

1786
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:19.330
<v Speaker 1>And so here is their attempt to escape </v>
<v Speaker 1>this forest.</v>

1787
01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:24.710
<v Speaker 1>They were just on a hike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this video is just,</v>

1788
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:25.723
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the craziest things I've </v>

1789
01:39:27.201 --> 01:39:29.430
<v Speaker 1>ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1790
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:35.720
<v Speaker 1>to 70 year old dad and a son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that jeep escaping the forest.</v>

1791
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:51.010
<v Speaker 11>Do I go here in a minute?</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think we can drive through this.</v>

1792
01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:00.863
<v Speaker 1>So for those of you that can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're driving down a narrow forced </v>

1793
01:40:04.441 --> 01:40:09.441
<v Speaker 1>path and fires raging pretty much on all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sides of them.</v>

1794
01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Really intense forest fire is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trees falling over.</v>

1795
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slow down.</v>

1796
01:40:26.230 --> 01:40:29.200
<v Speaker 1>It was like a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1797
01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:31.500
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they got,</v>

1798
01:40:31.530 --> 01:40:32.363
<v Speaker 1>they think they're out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fires Kinda cleared without the dad </v>

1799
01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:41.034
<v Speaker 1>said we're out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they turn a corner and it's </v>

1800
01:40:42.421 --> 01:40:46.290
<v Speaker 1>like the craziest hellscape I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

1801
01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Just fire everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fires raging over the road or</v>

1802
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.590
<v Speaker 9>driving through it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Literally driving through fire.</v>

1803
01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:59.340
<v Speaker 9>Can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Just go easy.</v>

1804
01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:02.470
<v Speaker 9>Now the car is heating up.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's going to explode.</v>

1805
01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:05.250
<v Speaker 9>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 9>God,</v>

<v Speaker 9>Carry on so we can see Joe's one.</v>

1807
01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:17.540
<v Speaker 9>If a tree falls on us,</v>
<v Speaker 9>please go out and help us get.</v>

1808
01:41:23.530 --> 01:41:26.510
<v Speaker 9>Nope,</v>

1809
01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:32.770
<v Speaker 9>Stop you gotta get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So they reached</v>

1810
01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:37.630
<v Speaker 1>a log in the road that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was covering the road.</v>

1811
01:41:37.631 --> 01:41:38.464
<v Speaker 1>It was on fire and it stops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were just like the craziest </v>

01:41:40.691 --> 01:41:42.730
<v Speaker 1>cliffhanger of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't write it.</v>

1813
01:41:42.731 --> 01:41:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Even in the movies that much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliffhanger.</v>

1814
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:47.380
<v Speaker 1>You know what I've got?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how the story ends.</v>

1815
01:41:47.381 --> 01:41:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read it to you guys there.</v>

1816
01:41:48.341 --> 01:41:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that shredder there?</v>

1817
01:41:50.850 --> 01:41:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1818
01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:53.313
<v Speaker 1>I find it interesting because that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's driving is like forties and the </v>

1819
01:41:56.051 --> 01:41:56.884
<v Speaker 1>data is 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like in this life threatening </v>

1820
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:59.103
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they like to evolve kind of back to </v>

1821
01:42:01.751 --> 01:42:05.590
<v Speaker 1>like a little child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1822
01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:08.643
<v Speaker 1>So these fucking lunatics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kick it into reverse and backed up </v>

1823
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:14.223
<v Speaker 1>through that real road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back through there in reverse and made </v>

1824
01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:20.290
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

1825
01:42:20.291 --> 01:42:22.300
<v Speaker 1>An excerpt of them explaining what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1826
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:24.333
<v Speaker 1>That's when things went bad to worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That tree ravaged by the intense fire </v>

1827
01:42:26.711 --> 01:42:29.110
<v Speaker 1>had fallen down across the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocking their escape route.</v>

1828
01:42:29.410 --> 01:42:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I saw that and I thought we were going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to die.</v>

1829
01:42:31.271 --> 01:42:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Justin said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were trapped.</v>

1830
01:42:33.161 --> 01:42:36.730
<v Speaker 1>There was no way we could turn around on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road with his father's guidance just</v>

1831
01:42:36.731 --> 01:42:37.564
<v Speaker 1>in kick the car into reverse and drove </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vehicle all the way back to the </v>

1832
01:42:39.911 --> 01:42:41.860
<v Speaker 1>trail head at the end of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At times.</v>

1833
01:42:41.861 --> 01:42:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Justin said he was going as fast as 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles per hour was absolutely insane.</v>

1834
01:42:45.941 --> 01:42:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I was able to keep the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car on the road.</v>

1835
01:42:47.951 --> 01:42:48.784
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow a few prayers in a higher </v>

1836
01:42:50.141 --> 01:42:50.974
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We stayed on the road once they were </v>

1837
01:42:52.691 --> 01:42:53.524
<v Speaker 1>back at the trail head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was safe from the fire for the </v>

1838
01:42:55.451 --> 01:42:56.284
<v Speaker 1>time being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walked down towards a nearby </v>

1839
01:42:57.971 --> 01:42:59.410
<v Speaker 1>cabinets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You if anyone could help them.</v>

1840
01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:00.483
<v Speaker 1>That's when they saw a small boat </v>
<v Speaker 1>floating on Lake Mcdonald with two </v>

1841
01:43:03.191 --> 01:43:04.024
<v Speaker 1>people aboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We flagged them down and they came over </v>

1842
01:43:05.741 --> 01:43:06.574
<v Speaker 1>and grabbed us and we got onto the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin said 10 minutes later we were on </v>

1843
01:43:09.821 --> 01:43:12.970
<v Speaker 1>the water and we saw the whole part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lecture where we had been standing.</v>

1844
01:43:12.971 --> 01:43:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Just go up in flames.</v>
