<v Speaker 4>He's a big boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't need this.</v>

126
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to misrepresent shredder.</v>

128
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 4>doesn't do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One day he was like,</v>

129
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:16.574
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>pure heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He reads the sign and he says,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You can't hold her breath long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to drown her in ges.</v>

239
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the turtles aren't in water.</v>

240
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.373
<v Speaker 4>You know they walk around the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they mean that they think she says </v>

241
00:12:26.161 --> 00:12:26.994
<v Speaker 4>they can't hold her breath long enough?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I assume he means because turtles are </v>

242
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.130
<v Speaker 4>water creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten beaming because they think.</v>

243
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.230
<v Speaker 4>Why would that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would she need to be underwater?</v>

244
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.600
<v Speaker 4>Because they stink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

245
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.320
<v Speaker 4>they'll hold her breath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

246
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't necessarily understand the </v>
<v Speaker 4>application,</v>

247
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:46.960
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't seem right either way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't hold her breath long enough,</v>

248
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.050
<v Speaker 4>I assume because they're drowning or in </v>
<v Speaker 4>com.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So a bunch of fucking heavy sectoral </v>

261
00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:22.554
<v Speaker 4>character and he probably wants to fuck </v>

<v Speaker 2>How does it feel like that?</v>

321
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.040
<v Speaker 2>There's like a license life growing</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

324
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:54.380

<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

325
00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:55.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

326
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.290

<v Speaker 4>what we're meant to do,</v>

327
00:16:57.291 --> 00:16:58.124
<v Speaker 4>but it's so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting how we're so removed </v>

328
00:17:02.211 --> 00:17:07.190
<v Speaker 4>from nature in a way that we find like </v>
<v Speaker 4>birth to be so magical,</v>

329
00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:09.930
<v Speaker 4>but it is magical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

330
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.280
<v Speaker 4>It's really something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just fuck it.</v>

331
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.720

<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

332
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:21.440
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a little heartbeat inside of</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and are we run the danger of gushing</v>

333
00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:22.994
<v Speaker 4>over our kids and nobody cares.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm already gushing over this little </v>

334
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:30.140
<v Speaker 4>because I saw people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm asking for the baby updates.</v>

335
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.353
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I guess let us know because I know I </v>

336
00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:38.570
<v Speaker 4>hate hearing about other people's kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

337
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.220
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody does.</v>

338
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.900
<v Speaker 4>And it's like because you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

339
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.350
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never understood how special it feels.</v>

340
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.273
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I don't know for already running </v>

341
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 4>that danger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like an ultrasound.</v>

342
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 4>It's like I already loved that little </v>
<v Speaker 4>gummy bear looking at him.</v>

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.310
<v Speaker 4>You have a life for sucking your energy </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

356
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:46.140
<v Speaker 4>You have a foreign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a host and I do have cravings for</v>

357
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:49.260
<v Speaker 4>people who were wondering if it's true </v>
<v Speaker 4>or not.</v>

358
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.343
<v Speaker 4>So like all of a sudden I really feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>like eating something Mac and cheese </v>

359
00:18:52.441 --> 00:18:55.410
<v Speaker 4>this morning or I'll really not feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>like eating something.</v>

360
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.550
<v Speaker 4>Mexican food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

361
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 4>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

362
00:18:57.841 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't want Mexican food anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

363
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.690
<v Speaker 4>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usually I love it.</v>

364
00:19:00.691 --> 00:19:02.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like all wheat this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

365
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.180
<v Speaker 4>Ethan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to make mack a treat.</v>

366
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.250
<v Speaker 4>Cope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I did.</v>

367
00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:09.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

368
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.850
<v Speaker 4>I was walking straight and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden I'm like Mac and cheese.</v>

369
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.373
<v Speaker 4>That's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the interesting thing is about the </v>

370
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:20.541
<v Speaker 4>cravings is that I wonder if there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>really some actual science behind it.</v>

371
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:26.250
<v Speaker 4>We're there is because there was one </v>
<v Speaker 4>week where all of a sudden every night I</v>

372
00:19:26.251 --> 00:19:27.560
<v Speaker 4>want to add a mommy.</v>

373
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.660
<v Speaker 4>I feel aware.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

374
00:19:29.661 --> 00:19:30.494
<v Speaker 4>And so soybean and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really good for you to be </v>

375
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.000
<v Speaker 4>so and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now I'm completely over it.</v>

376
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't touch it.</v>

377
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:37.973
<v Speaker 4>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was before we knew you were </v>

378
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:40.230
<v Speaker 4>pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was,</v>

379
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like you were craving Mac and cheese</v>

380
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:44.754
<v Speaker 4>and I wonder if you needed like calcium </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the vitamins and all this dairy and </v>

381
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:48.620
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some awesome.</v>

382
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.700
<v Speaker 4>Even butter and cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fat,</v>

383
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.940
<v Speaker 4>lots of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

384
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.700
<v Speaker 4>very cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very exciting stuff.</v>

385
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have so much appreciation.</v>

386
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.903
<v Speaker 4>I really do know that you are raising </v>
<v Speaker 4>this child and your stomach and you're </v>

387
00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:07.824
<v Speaker 4>going to give birth to this child.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really afraid of that guys have to </v>

388
00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:11.754
<v Speaker 4>do is not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing easier in the world and </v>

389
00:20:14.401 --> 00:20:18.750
<v Speaker 4>nutting I think I'll be okay until like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fifth month or something.</v>

390
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.290
<v Speaker 4>But then things started to get hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm scared.</v>

391
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm scared of that part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're scared,</v>

392
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:28.520
<v Speaker 4>but I'm excited because I know it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be fine and I know you're going</v>

393
00:20:28.521 --> 00:20:29.354
<v Speaker 4>to be great and I can't wait to see the </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformation and everything and all </v>

394
00:20:32.641 --> 00:20:36.330
<v Speaker 4>the changes and like you growing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be so wild,</v>

395
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 4>but I understand you're scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is scared.</v>

396
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:39.174
<v Speaker 4>I'd be scared too if it was me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know everything's going to be </v>

397
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:45.390
<v Speaker 4>great and I'm looking at like maternity </v>
<v Speaker 4>clothes and it's so not my style.</v>

398
00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:47.540
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be hip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

399
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.130
<v Speaker 4>What am I going to wear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I already don't feel my clothes.</v>

400
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.580
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if there's any Gucci,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maternity pants.</v>

401
00:20:54.581 --> 00:20:59.581
<v Speaker 4>We can get you all swagged out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we started looking at baby stuff.</v>

402
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:00.483
<v Speaker 4>We bought some baby clothes for our </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends and they're like so freaking </v>

403
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 4>cool and obviously way more affordable </v>
<v Speaker 4>than like adult clothes.</v>

404
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:13.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to let this sit close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go to waste.</v>

407

<v Speaker 4>I'm having another kid just so I can put</v>
<v Speaker 4>them in this dope ass clothes again.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But I swear to God,</v>

409

<v Speaker 4>Something else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

414
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 4>So there you go.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

420
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.030
<v Speaker 4>but not all babies have a heartbeat like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one.</v>

421
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.960
<v Speaker 4>Did they all look like a gummy bear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

422
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.900
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that heartbeat is like a sick.</v>

423
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.120
<v Speaker 4>I could tell he's got like rhythm and </v>
<v Speaker 4>soul too.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like this guy is artistic ash unit is </v>
<v Speaker 4>empathetic.</v>

425
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.760

<v Speaker 4>Basically.</v>

426
00:22:12.761 --> 00:22:17.080
<v Speaker 4>Gandhi mixed with everything out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>best things you can imagine.</v>

427
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:17.711
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

428
00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:21.790
<v Speaker 4>They're presented with the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 4>to steal a bunch of candy.</v>

429
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 4>He would take one politely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>

430
00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:24.880
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Daddy,</v>

431
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.373
<v Speaker 4>let's get off this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm pushing it in too long as the </v>

432
00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:35.281
<v Speaker 4>title of the episode indicates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Post Malone is under fire by the media.</v>

433
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.293
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me preface this by saying that post </v>

434
00:22:38.831 --> 00:22:39.664
<v Speaker 4>Malone has become so popular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so successful this year has been </v>

435
00:22:46.121 --> 00:22:46.954
<v Speaker 4>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read something that he has been the </v>

436
00:22:49.571 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 4>most streamed in the most popular </v>
<v Speaker 4>musician of this entire year.</v>

437
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:54.843
<v Speaker 4>He is the biggest musician in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand 18 or maybe the United </v>

438
00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.133
<v Speaker 4>States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

439
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.070
<v Speaker 4>but like combined with his first album,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his first album.</v>

440
00:23:03.071 --> 00:23:03.904
<v Speaker 4>You guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Baroque Michael Jackson's thriller </v>

441
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:08.763
<v Speaker 4>record for being on like the top 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>billboard for the longest consecutive </v>

442
00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:14.260
<v Speaker 4>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

443
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.760
<v Speaker 4>Do we have no internet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

444
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.620
<v Speaker 4>I have internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

445
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.410
<v Speaker 4>I think so Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have Internet.</v>

446
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.040
<v Speaker 4>Thank God we have a backup system for </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

447
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.353
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so post Malone has been wildly </v>

448
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.740
<v Speaker 4>successful and I would say he has </v>
<v Speaker 4>critics,</v>

449
00:23:35.741 --> 00:23:39.010
<v Speaker 4>but from the fans and the people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>consume his music,</v>

450
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.660
<v Speaker 4>he always loved you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Always had gotten a lot of shit.</v>

451
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's gotten a lot of shit.</v>

452
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 4>But the people who give him</v>

453
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 2>shit are kind of like the old guards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

454
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.023
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

455
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.240
<v Speaker 2>but the fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consumers,</v>

456
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.990
<v Speaker 2>he's beloved because he's such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got such a great personality.</v>

457
00:23:59.991 --> 00:24:01.400
<v Speaker 2>He's such a chill dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

458
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.260
<v Speaker 2>he's just a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

460
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.730
<v Speaker 2>there's no question about that.</v>

461
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.360
<v Speaker 4>Never claimed to want to make anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>more than just some good music.</v>

462
00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.400
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

463
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:19.380
<v Speaker 4>And this article is exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the problem apparently</v>

464
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.460
<v Speaker 2>problem that this Arthur seems to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is in the Washington Post,</v>

465
00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:24.294
<v Speaker 2>so this is a big reputable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was shared with me by a lot of </v>

466
00:24:27.241 --> 00:24:28.074
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think a lot of eyeballs fell in </v>

467
00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:29.654
<v Speaker 2>this article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem he seems to have is that </v>

468
00:24:32.431 --> 00:24:33.264
<v Speaker 2>he's not woke enough of some sorts or he</v>
<v Speaker 2>sees Postville and success as </v>

469
00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:38.934
<v Speaker 2>symptomatic of all of the problems in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and he makes all these grand </v>

470
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.050
<v Speaker 2>comparisons to like conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

471
00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:46.884
<v Speaker 2>It's very political who he makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparisons to him being like Donald </v>

472
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Trump,</v>

473
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:55.050
<v Speaker 4>the factory setting it then info.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's somehow like,</v>

474
00:24:55.051 --> 00:24:56.910
<v Speaker 4>now we all need to judge him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

475
00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's pro gun or like an Apoc,</v>

476
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a doomsday or whatever you want to </v>

477
00:25:03.901 --> 00:25:05.640
<v Speaker 2>call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

478
00:25:05.641 --> 00:25:09.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use to paint this picture that he's some</v>

479
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.093
<v Speaker 2>sleeper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative outright troll I think is </v>

480
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:14.874
<v Speaker 2>kind of somewhat</v>

481
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.910
<v Speaker 4>to tone for sure because there's</v>

482
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.793
<v Speaker 2>not really any proof to support that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they kind of try to build this case </v>

483
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.380
<v Speaker 2>using things that aren't really direct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

484
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.330
<v Speaker 2>So they don't really come out and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

485
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.293
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about Austin that I know is </v>

486
00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:36.140
<v Speaker 2>that he's never tried to do or be </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

487
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.200
<v Speaker 2>He's just making music that he likes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

488
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:44.260
<v Speaker 2>It's from styles that he likes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody is like,</v>

489
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.970
<v Speaker 2>if you don't like his music,</v>

490
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.210
<v Speaker 2>if you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

491
00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

492
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.060
<v Speaker 2>The thing about this article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

493
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:55.143
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting and it's worthy of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis of who he is and why he's </v>

494
00:25:58.261 --> 00:26:01.110
<v Speaker 2>popular now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's so mean spirited.</v>

495
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:02.543
<v Speaker 2>It's so mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you should read some from the </v>

496
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:05.551
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

497
00:26:05.551 --> 00:26:07.200
<v Speaker 2>let me show you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

498
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.680
<v Speaker 2>really pop this open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The video is so obnoxious.</v>

499
00:26:10.681 --> 00:26:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's start with this post malone.</v>

500
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.820
<v Speaker 2>You think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have no idea.</v>

501
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.373
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the title is post Malone is the perfect </v>

502
00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:21.390
<v Speaker 2>pop star of this American moment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a compliment.</v>

503
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like one God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like a nice.</v>

504
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:26.873
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you just say what you want to </v>

505
00:26:28.141 --> 00:26:29.490
<v Speaker 2>say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

506
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Because she is the author.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He or she,</v>

507
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.353
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Weiss is trying to make this point </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like he's perfect because of Donald </v>

508
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:41.330
<v Speaker 2>trump and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why he's.</v>

<v Speaker 7>I really am interested in your story.</v>

513
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:51.963
<v Speaker 7>You might know post Malone as the </v>
<v Speaker 7>soundcloud rapper who went triple </v>

514
00:26:54.621 --> 00:26:57.020
<v Speaker 7>platinum for his debut track,</v>
<v Speaker 7>White Iverson.</v>

515
00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.220
<v Speaker 7>You might know him as the genre bending </v>
<v Speaker 7>artists combining country.</v>

516
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.980
<v Speaker 7>Granted,</v>

<v Speaker 7>but you should.</v>

521
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.600
<v Speaker 7>Malone is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>For context,</v>

522
00:27:14.601 --> 00:27:15.434
<v Speaker 7>his album,</v>
<v Speaker 7>stoney beat out Michael Jackson's </v>

523
00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:21.690
<v Speaker 7>thriller for most weeks and top 10 on </v>
<v Speaker 7>the top RMB dies.</v>

524
00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.440
<v Speaker 7>That may surprise you.</v>

525
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:30.300
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this talentless a hack actually dethrone</v>

526
00:27:30.301 --> 00:27:31.260
<v Speaker 4>Michael Jackson.</v>

527
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.870
<v Speaker 7>Do you understand the artists a bit </v>
<v Speaker 7>better?</v>

528
00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.060
<v Speaker 7>Born Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Richard Post,</v>

529
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:38.953
<v Speaker 7>he became post malone the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Donald Glover became childish Gambino </v>

530
00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.840
<v Speaker 7>through rap name generator.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Malone wasn't always focused on.</v>

531
00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.990
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Music is very eerie and in,</v>

532
00:27:46.991 --> 00:27:47.261
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

533
00:27:47.261 --> 00:27:47.531
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

534
00:27:47.531 --> 00:27:50.580
<v Speaker 4>in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like crunching the numbers a little</v>

535
00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:53.340
<v Speaker 4>fucking spooky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little.</v>

536
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.830
<v Speaker 4>Something's wrong here.</v>

537
00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.510
<v Speaker 7>He learned how to play guitar by playing</v>
<v Speaker 7>guitar hero.</v>

538
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.570
<v Speaker 7>I started playing a guitar because I </v>
<v Speaker 7>felt cool with the controller,</v>

539
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.720
<v Speaker 7>so I says,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let me do the real thing in Hollywood.</v>

540
00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.950
<v Speaker 7>They're part of a heavy metal band.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He credits Bob.</v>

541
00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:13.950
<v Speaker 7>Dylan is one of his major influences.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Executives.</v>

542
00:28:13.951 --> 00:28:14.784
<v Speaker 7>Record company.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Republic records have described Malone </v>

543
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:21.860
<v Speaker 7>as the Donald Trump of hip hop because </v>
<v Speaker 7>quote things that should have killed his</v>

544
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:23.820
<v Speaker 7>career.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He only made him bigger.</v>

545
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.013
<v Speaker 4>So here they're trying to make an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unjustified parallel between him and </v>

546
00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:31.530
<v Speaker 4>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things that should have killed them.</v>

547
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.393
<v Speaker 4>Only made them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know what they're talking </v>

548
00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was one dude's quo,</v>

549
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.560
<v Speaker 4>but they're just even just by being like</v>
<v Speaker 4>post Malone,</v>

550
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.070
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though they say it again in another</v>

551
00:28:41.071 --> 00:28:44.580
<v Speaker 4>context in the article.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like they're kind of,</v>

552
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.833
<v Speaker 4>almost subconsciously in a way being </v>
<v Speaker 4>like he is Donald Trump and he supports </v>

553
00:28:52.381 --> 00:28:56.190
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make it like everything's got to be</v>

554
00:28:56.191 --> 00:28:58.110
<v Speaker 4>political,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he likes guns.</v>

555
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you're a liberal,</v>

556
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.043
<v Speaker 4>they say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a liberal and you believe in </v>

557
00:29:02.611 --> 00:29:06.150
<v Speaker 4>resisting Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you should hate post malone.</v>

558
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.650
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

559
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 4>it's got nothing to do with politics.</v>

560
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:11.803
<v Speaker 7>Twenty 16.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He said he considered playing President </v>

561
00:29:13.431 --> 00:29:16.040
<v Speaker 7>Donald Trump's inauguration fast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

562
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.930
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty much in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

563
00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:22.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess you.</v>

564
00:29:22.391 --> 00:29:24.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did he know about trump back then?</v>

565
00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.773
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nope.</v>

566
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.813
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also if a president asked you to </v>

567
00:29:29.021 --> 00:29:34.021
<v Speaker 4>play the inauguration and it's few years</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago too.</v>

568
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.731

<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

569

<v Speaker 4>in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his first album hadn't even come out.</v>

570
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't a megastar every word he said </v>

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.633
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somehow they're turning everything into </v>

602
00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:15.610
<v Speaker 4>like having a negative tone even though </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just saying like,</v>

603
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.350
<v Speaker 4>did you know that he's physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplishment.</v>

605
00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.490

<v Speaker 4>face often associated with criminal </v>

608
00:31:36.101 --> 00:31:36.934
<v Speaker 4>gangs?</v>

609
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.310

<v Speaker 8>talked you into getting a tattoo?</v>

610
00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.970
<v Speaker 8>I figured because we were working on </v>
<v Speaker 8>stony and then um,</v>

611
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.690
<v Speaker 8>we had a tattoo artist come through and </v>

614
00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:59.310
<v Speaker 4>Why would they show that he's kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's obviously kidding.</v>

615
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.383
<v Speaker 4>But like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what is living cut it off before the </v>

616
00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:06.711
<v Speaker 4>laughter of the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't understand.</v>

617
00:32:07.841 --> 00:32:08.674
<v Speaker 4>So this is the video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the kind of preface this toe </v>

618
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.710
<v Speaker 4>that sets the tone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He didn't vote.</v>

623
00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.420
<v Speaker 4>He's friends with Justin Bieber.</v>

628
00:32:35.031 --> 00:32:35.864
<v Speaker 4>without being like so obvious about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they constructed a way that </v>

677
00:35:11.171 --> 00:35:12.004
<v Speaker 4>computer screens can actually damage </v>
<v Speaker 4>your eyes and I'm sad to say that </v>

678
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:15.853
<v Speaker 4>research is starting to show that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>blue light coming from screens can kill </v>

<v Speaker 4>front of screens and now the technology </v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like that.</v>

793
00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.250

<v Speaker 2>his music,</v>

795
00:41:22.891 --> 00:41:25.920

796
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.160

819
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:49.160
<v Speaker 2>could like him is if the world was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>upside down.</v>

820
00:42:49.161 --> 00:42:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Enough sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like Donald Trump did.</v>

821
00:42:51.441 --> 00:42:52.274
<v Speaker 2>We mentioned possibly Nielsen recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>named a the suburban Dallas raised </v>

822
00:42:58.431 --> 00:43:00.920
<v Speaker 2>rapper 2018 is the most popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>musician,</v>

823
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:01.933
<v Speaker 2>so it was only a matter of time before </v>
<v Speaker 2>malone had his own festival of </v>

824
00:43:03.891 --> 00:43:04.724
<v Speaker 2>contemporary rite of passage for nearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>every major pop rap star who has his </v>

825
00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:12.230
<v Speaker 2>face plastered across spotifies get </v>
<v Speaker 2>turnt playlists.</v>

826
00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's on other playlists than </v>
<v Speaker 2>get turnt.</v>

827
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:15.523
<v Speaker 2>More like most popular songs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that one asshole get termed </v>

828
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.393
<v Speaker 2>the inauguration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Post-Defense was held Sunday night in </v>

829
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Dallas's Dos equis pavilion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watched it like,</v>

830
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and did it have to be on a beer?</v>

831
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.550
<v Speaker 2>And it was a less a festival than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>behemoth.</v>

832
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.190
<v Speaker 2>What is sae a?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what that is?</v>

833
00:43:37.191 --> 00:43:38.024
<v Speaker 2>Dan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rush mixer held on a few acres of </v>

834
00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:40.754
<v Speaker 2>corporate branded concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many festivals pride themselves on </v>

835
00:43:43.131 --> 00:43:43.964
<v Speaker 2>offering non musical diversity diversion</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as art installations or novelty </v>

836
00:43:48.141 --> 00:43:50.540
<v Speaker 2>culinary options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds awful.</v>

837
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.300
<v Speaker 2>There were none of that here though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just $5.</v>

838
00:43:53.301 --> 00:43:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Jello shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I want.</v>

839
00:43:55.221 --> 00:43:58.820
<v Speaker 2>When I go to a show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a novelty culinary option.</v>

840
00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I think the essay is a reference to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Frat by the way,</v>

841
00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.510
<v Speaker 2>so he's just saying like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a frat party.</v>

842
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I think he's confusing a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A concert with a farmer's market.</v>

843
00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Speaker 2>The shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concerts that I usually go to remind</v>

844
00:44:13.731 --> 00:44:15.470
<v Speaker 2>me of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calabasas farmer's market.</v>

845
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:18.363
<v Speaker 2>There were a little to separate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were a little separated from </v>

846
00:44:19.821 --> 00:44:21.190
<v Speaker 2>regular postal and concert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

847
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:26.040
<v Speaker 2>the big name opening acts and true </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion sponsored post Malone Bandanas,</v>

848
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.180
<v Speaker 2>featuring an extreme closeup of Austin </v>
<v Speaker 2>post itself.</v>

849
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Glade squinting as ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is wrong with having a festival?</v>

850
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:35.250
<v Speaker 2>That's him plus other big artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the first festival?</v>

851
00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:36.283
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy to put together the </v>

852
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:41.690
<v Speaker 2>crazy through that together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know he was working on it a while.</v>

853
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:44.623
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he's comparing it to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe in five years they would get </v>

854
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:47.964
<v Speaker 2>crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

855
00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.090
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to a Lollapalooza,</v>

856
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.870
<v Speaker 2>this thing sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no novelty.</v>

857
00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:55.704
<v Speaker 2>Arts and crafts stations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This should have ostensively been a </v>

858
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:01.104
<v Speaker 2>coordination is unequivocal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ascension to the a list pops </v>

859
00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:08.090
<v Speaker 2>superstardom of mano named visionaries </v>
<v Speaker 2>do stop.</v>

860
00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:14.220
<v Speaker 2>There are artists who dictate the Zeit </v>
<v Speaker 2>geist and those who reflected possible.</v>

861
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:15.063
<v Speaker 2>One is to the ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Avatar of algorithm culture that </v>

862
00:45:18.451 --> 00:45:21.560
<v Speaker 2>rewards pleasant banality over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative leap.</v>

863
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Vexing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to.</v>

864
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm listening to music,</v>

865
00:45:25.171 --> 00:45:28.020
<v Speaker 2>I want to be vexed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be confused,</v>

866
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:30.270
<v Speaker 2>or it's like you're trying to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

867
00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:33.220
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

868
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.050
<v Speaker 2>this guy needs to be thinking all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

869
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:40.590
<v Speaker 2>Sorry about my cough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys.</v>

870
00:45:40.591 --> 00:45:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm still getting over this illness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his own festival in his hometown.</v>

871
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 2>He had the opportunity to lucidly stayed</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mission and values.</v>

872
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.083
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he revealed himself to be Jack Johnson </v>

873
00:45:50.221 --> 00:45:52.910
<v Speaker 2>of the Ada weights and nakedly grafted </v>
<v Speaker 2>hip hop.</v>

874
00:45:52.911 --> 00:45:54.690
<v Speaker 2>So I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like running for office.</v>

875
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I believe I read.</v>

876
00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.800
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't reject trump.</v>

877
00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:02.970
<v Speaker 2>And tell everybody to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

878
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:04.770
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

879
00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.400
<v Speaker 2>He had the opportunity to state his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mission and values.</v>

880
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like that's what he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

881
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:14.743
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike Jay Z and beyonce who say they </v>

882
00:46:16.261 --> 00:46:19.830
<v Speaker 2>hate trump and urge everyone to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't actually want to say that,</v>

883
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.313
<v Speaker 2>but that you know what the thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is kind of why he's popping and </v>

884
00:46:25.641 --> 00:46:26.474
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you why because young kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may already have their mind up and </v>

885
00:46:30.751 --> 00:46:31.584
<v Speaker 2>then maybe politically motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this article is part of the problem </v>

886
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:37.260
<v Speaker 2>in that it politicizes everything.</v>

887
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.530
<v Speaker 2>And Post Malone is decidedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpolitical.</v>

888
00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:45.531
<v Speaker 2>He said even two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't vote and he's a young guy.</v>

889
00:46:45.541 --> 00:46:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

890
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.630
<v Speaker 2>but like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nice.</v>

891
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.073
<v Speaker 2>It is nice to separate politics from </v>
<v Speaker 2>some fucking thing because it's </v>

892
00:46:53.851 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 2>literally everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

893
00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.033
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to be preached to all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>effing time and is doing it as a </v>

894
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:08.580
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he,</v>

895
00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:10.253
<v Speaker 2>that's what he wants and like it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to have fun because the </v>

896
00:47:13.291 --> 00:47:16.350
<v Speaker 2>point is that he's trying to have fun </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's his personality.</v>

897
00:47:16.351 --> 00:47:20.460
<v Speaker 2>When you hung out with him and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a political conversation.</v>

898
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Well this is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

933
00:49:06.581 --> 00:49:08.920
<v Speaker 4>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Girls that I wanted to fuck,</v>

934
00:49:08.921 --> 00:49:11.080
<v Speaker 4>but sadly will never have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity,</v>

935
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:13.083
<v Speaker 4>the Jonas brothers or one direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The main difference this time is that </v>

936
00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:20.380
<v Speaker 4>they honored their hero with matching </v>
<v Speaker 4>temporary face tattoos,</v>

937
00:49:20.381 --> 00:49:24.160
<v Speaker 4>barbed wire on the forehead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a knife like crucifix.</v>

938
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:27.160
<v Speaker 4>On the cheek and his trademark phrase </v>
<v Speaker 4>inked and cursive.</v>

939
00:49:27.161 --> 00:49:32.161
<v Speaker 4>Stay away and rest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Easy temporary faced.</v>

940
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.333
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a bunch of gang members with </v>

941
00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:39.400
<v Speaker 4>their rose in Troy Aiken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jerseys and beer bong,</v>

942
00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:40.630
<v Speaker 4>Bentley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>March,</v>

943
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:45.580
<v Speaker 4>a merge grunted with Siemian Glee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>1,000</v>

944
00:49:45.581 --> 00:49:48.850
<v Speaker 4>people rocketed up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stood on their seats for a brief moment.</v>

945
00:49:48.851 --> 00:49:49.684
<v Speaker 4>There was palatable fear of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>stampeded the death at postmortem </v>

946
00:49:53.201 --> 00:49:57.100
<v Speaker 4>concert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which of course requires the deceased to</v>

947
00:49:57.101 --> 00:49:57.934
<v Speaker 4>be buried in a racecar shaped coffin </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrapped in the rockstar energy drink </v>

948
00:50:02.261 --> 00:50:03.880
<v Speaker 4>logo to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you trying to be funny?</v>

949
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.320
<v Speaker 4>Three M and m's song served as his </v>
<v Speaker 4>intro.</v>

950
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.101
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

951
00:50:09.101 --> 00:50:13.300
<v Speaker 4>They make this about race watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>presumably a tested nod to his fandom,</v>

952
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:14.373
<v Speaker 4>but also a heavy handed reminder that </v>
<v Speaker 4>postman was the most popular white guy </v>

953
00:50:16.601 --> 00:50:21.601
<v Speaker 4>and hip hop since Marshall mathers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck criticizes a m and m at the</v>

954
00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:23.554
<v Speaker 4>moment when the hysteria seemed in </v>
<v Speaker 4>danger of laney posts took the stage to </v>

955
00:50:27.531 --> 00:50:28.364
<v Speaker 4>definitely tears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scorching jet flames and billowing </v>

956
00:50:31.671 --> 00:50:36.671
<v Speaker 4>clouds of smoke like a groupon version </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a kiss concert in 1975.</v>

957
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.470
<v Speaker 4>A group on version.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all roof.</v>

958
00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.600
<v Speaker 4>There's no group on version you when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>get groupon,</v>

959
00:50:44.601 --> 00:50:46.930
<v Speaker 4>you go so you can get a discount.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get a disk,</v>

960
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.670
<v Speaker 4>you see kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your analogies are all twisted.</v>

961
00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:50.504
<v Speaker 4>Buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should have said a dollar store </v>

962
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:57.740
<v Speaker 4>version because group on gets you into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the show.</v>

963
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.240
<v Speaker 4>That was a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

964
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:03.103
<v Speaker 4>Get me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you need to go back and finish </v>

965
00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.410
<v Speaker 4>your degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big Shot.</v>

966
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:09.650
<v Speaker 4>Groupon version,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sipping from a Red Solo Cup.</v>

967
00:51:09.651 --> 00:51:14.360
<v Speaker 4>He soon began slurring too young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

968
00:51:14.361 --> 00:51:16.700
<v Speaker 4>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He makes it sound like he's so drunk.</v>

969
00:51:16.701 --> 00:51:17.534
<v Speaker 4>He can't say anything to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now with a voice like bong water </v>

970
00:51:22.641 --> 00:51:27.641
<v Speaker 4>bubbling and the casual misogyny of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>member of a red pill subreddit.</v>

971
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.350
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

972
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:31.913
<v Speaker 4>So here you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A direct connection to like some </v>

973
00:51:33.411 --> 00:51:35.720
<v Speaker 4>outright red pilling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

974
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:37.190
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's in your mind.</v>

975
00:51:37.191 --> 00:51:38.210
<v Speaker 4>That's not what's there.</v>

976
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:42.620
<v Speaker 4>I actually can't read it because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>believed everything out.</v>

977
00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:45.620
<v Speaker 4>My whip fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my bitch bad.</v>

978
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:48.800
<v Speaker 4>I guess I skirt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>skirt that coop fast.</v>

979
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:50.600
<v Speaker 4>My coop fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your bitch.</v>

980
00:51:50.601 --> 00:51:54.020
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my bitch slow should do what I say so.</v>

981
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:54.913
<v Speaker 4>And she always keeps me on my toes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those lines are as good as any </v>

982
00:51:58.461 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Speaker 4>representing weapon alone is working on </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lyrical level will have to say if he's</v>

983
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:07.331
<v Speaker 4>picking out the most misogynistic stick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>red pilled Eric's lyrics,</v>

984
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:09.464
<v Speaker 4>that ain't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not that persuasive because </v>

985
00:52:11.301 --> 00:52:16.160
<v Speaker 4>that's gonna be a real task to start </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at lyrics.</v>

986
00:52:16.161 --> 00:52:19.410
<v Speaker 4>So hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

987
00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.353
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the truth that like Kendrick Lamar </v>

988
00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.593
<v Speaker 4>who is applauded by all has a great line</v>
<v Speaker 4>and from his new album where he says </v>

989
00:52:27.291 --> 00:52:31.030
<v Speaker 4>he's fears being judged by his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

990
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.100
<v Speaker 4>his most baselines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

991
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.190
<v Speaker 4>and if this is the best you could find </v>
<v Speaker 4>through this,</v>

992
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.033
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really not convincing me that </v>

993
00:52:39.591 --> 00:52:43.470
<v Speaker 4>he's a red pill subreddit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

994
00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:45.673
<v Speaker 4>on recordings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his falsetto is afforded a modest four </v>

995
00:52:48.411 --> 00:52:49.244
<v Speaker 4>cylinder strength,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but on stage it comes off slurred and </v>

996
00:52:51.561 --> 00:52:53.860
<v Speaker 4>sloppy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Switching like roadkill,</v>

997
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:55.730
<v Speaker 4>twitching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitching,</v>

998
00:52:55.731 --> 00:52:57.260
<v Speaker 4>like roadkill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>limp off.</v>

999
00:52:57.261 --> 00:52:58.094
<v Speaker 4>Key notes underscored by a booming </v>
<v Speaker 4>backing track that operated like a life </v>

1000
00:53:02.361 --> 00:53:06.410
<v Speaker 4>preserver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get amped up tonight.</v>

1001
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.710
<v Speaker 4>Who was left up tonight if I forget the </v>
<v Speaker 4>words because I'm too drunk,</v>

1002
00:53:09.711 --> 00:53:10.544
<v Speaker 4>helped me sing along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He told the crowd is the same applause </v>

1003
00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:13.724
<v Speaker 4>line that he used at Coachella is entire</v>
<v Speaker 4>set list was essentially identical to </v>

1004
00:53:16.881 --> 00:53:18.830
<v Speaker 4>what he played at every festival all </v>
<v Speaker 4>summer long.</v>

1005
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Right down to the mono Cylo syllabic </v>
<v Speaker 4>curse laden between song,</v>

1006
00:53:23.991 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 4>babbling about haters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the importance of</v>

1007
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.710
<v Speaker 2>rocky raking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what caught.</v>

1008
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what's called a set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty normal.</v>

1009
00:53:30.691 --> 00:53:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's called a set.</v>

1010
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:34.463
<v Speaker 2>If you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been doing the same thing for 10 </v>

1011
00:53:35.521 --> 00:53:37.470
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be interesting.</v>

1012
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:40.140
<v Speaker 2>He's been doing the same thing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>summer.</v>

1013
00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:45.060
<v Speaker 2>It's called a set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tours a lot.</v>

1014
00:53:45.061 --> 00:53:46.320
<v Speaker 2>You've got to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1015
00:53:46.321 --> 00:53:47.154
<v Speaker 2>you got to set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys hear that the rolling stones </v>

1016
00:53:50.581 --> 00:53:54.210
<v Speaker 2>played painted black at their concert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

1017
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:59.490
<v Speaker 2>Post Malone dare to come out with a set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I go to festivals,</v>

1018
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:01.080
<v Speaker 2>after I'm done with my arts and crafts </v>
<v Speaker 2>booth,</v>

1019
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:04.440
<v Speaker 2>I like to enjoy spoken word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different every time it's performed</v>

1020
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:10.320
<v Speaker 2>as if as if the people coming to a show </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to hear the fricken classics,</v>

1021
00:54:10.321 --> 00:54:12.270
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy has two albums.</v>

1022
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.990
<v Speaker 2>It's all there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1023
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's voice barely slithered </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed the 10th road.</v>

1024
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.510
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if fans who knew every</v>
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>

1025
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.180
<v Speaker 2>they were there to commune to songs such</v>
<v Speaker 2>as better now,</v>

1026
00:54:24.181 --> 00:54:26.430
<v Speaker 2>his latest anthem and interchangeable </v>
<v Speaker 2>heartbreak,</v>

1027
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:31.610
<v Speaker 2>presumably made for streaming at that Wa</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's fished up those kiosk and lax</v>

1028
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.033
<v Speaker 10>wet.</v>

1029
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:37.553
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem isn't necessarily that it's </v>

1030
00:54:40.141 --> 00:54:42.180
<v Speaker 2>crass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that it's meaningless.</v>

1031
00:54:42.181 --> 00:54:44.220
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a red pillar.</v>

1032
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not that it's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's vacant.</v>

1033
00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:51.690
<v Speaker 2>It's the losing difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriation and outright theft.</v>

1034
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:52.733
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there he's actually accusing him not </v>

1035
00:54:55.831 --> 00:54:56.664
<v Speaker 2>just of a cultural appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a high charge enough but </v>

1036
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:04.670
<v Speaker 2>outright theft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1037
00:55:05.341 --> 00:55:08.140
<v Speaker 2>this music is only fit for streaming at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wa.</v>

1038
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.053
<v Speaker 2>Who's fish taco kiosk at lax?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he get a kickback from the Taco </v>

1039
00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:14.423
<v Speaker 2>Kiosk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does see this guy is involved in big </v>

1040
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:18.510
<v Speaker 2>fish taco kiosk money,</v>

1041
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:22.023
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this article upset him too </v>

1042
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:25.780
<v Speaker 2>because he tweeted out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

1043
00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:27.003
<v Speaker 2>The same day it came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I presume was in response to this </v>

1044
00:55:31.091 --> 00:55:34.840
<v Speaker 2>article because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1045
00:55:34.841 --> 00:55:39.520
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not trying to be anything.</v>

1046
00:55:39.521 --> 00:55:42.370
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not trying to be,</v>

1047
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:46.210
<v Speaker 2>he's not being a fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not being,</v>

1048
00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's being authentic,</v>

1049
00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:51.310
<v Speaker 2>so if you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand it's not for everybody,</v>

1050
00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:54.940
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to bother you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody seems to like about you,</v>

1051
00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:56.163
<v Speaker 2>but you have to make it seem like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fabric that's tearing our country </v>

1052
00:55:59.951 --> 00:56:00.784
<v Speaker 2>apart and it's really not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally find articles like this to </v>

1053
00:56:03.311 --> 00:56:07.720
<v Speaker 2>be more damaging than anything possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loves doing it.</v>

1054
00:56:07.721 --> 00:56:09.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's popular.</v>

1055
00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.650
<v Speaker 2>He's doing what he's always done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's making music.</v>

1056
00:56:11.651 --> 00:56:12.484
<v Speaker 2>He likes people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked him and they attached to him and </v>

1057
00:56:15.311 --> 00:56:16.270
<v Speaker 2>they like what he's doing.</v>

1058
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:19.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's popular posts.</v>

1059
00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1060
00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:22.803
<v Speaker 2>He didn't cheat his way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The top yard in Postville as music is </v>

1061
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:29.350
<v Speaker 2>dead eyed in ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>astonishing Dole and it's materialism,</v>

1062
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:30.184
<v Speaker 2>abandoned an abandoned lot of creativity</v>
<v Speaker 2>with absolutely no evidence of traffic </v>

1063
00:56:34.031 --> 00:56:37.420
<v Speaker 2>and it's cerebral cortex who you are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>

1064
00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.840
<v Speaker 2>You are so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's also a negative side.</v>

1065
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1066
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.910
<v Speaker 2>this was all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's intention is sincere.</v>

1067
00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Homage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blood during wet.</v>

1068
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.700
<v Speaker 2>What lists limit imitation can't help </v>
<v Speaker 2>but feel like minstrelsy good verbiage,</v>

1069
00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:02.020
<v Speaker 2>verbiage here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait for like a minstrel show,</v>

1070
00:57:02.021 --> 00:57:05.840
<v Speaker 2>like face kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1071
00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:08.373
<v Speaker 2>While people will inevitably appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most culturally relevant music </v>

1072
00:57:11.381 --> 00:57:13.900
<v Speaker 2>genre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one that's becoming almost interlink,</v>

1073
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.380
<v Speaker 2>intrinsically bound to the modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception of pop,</v>

1074
00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 2>but it's not asking too much to attempt </v>
<v Speaker 2>modest synthesis or the incorporation of</v>

1075
00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:22.864
<v Speaker 2>a single new idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least to not be so grotesquely </v>

1076
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:26.733
<v Speaker 2>desolate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went from eminem to Cheddar Bob </v>

<v Speaker 2>Shout out to Cheddar Bob.</v>

1078
00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:34.420
<v Speaker 2>If posted one were black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't have sold half.</v>

1079
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:35.980
<v Speaker 2>He simply wouldn't exist.</v>

1080
00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:42.550
<v Speaker 2>There you have it right here from Bob </v>
<v Speaker 2>Weiss.</v>

1081
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:46.630
<v Speaker 2>More and more we don't read the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get the idea,</v>

1082
00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:50.170
<v Speaker 2>but I just think it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1083
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:52.870
<v Speaker 2>it's a little dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's most,</v>

1084
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.093
<v Speaker 2>what's most damning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This post Malone's bloodless abyss of </v>

1085
00:57:57.521 --> 00:57:58.354
<v Speaker 2>soul and funk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you have a bloodless attempts at </v>

1086
00:58:02.261 --> 00:58:04.650
<v Speaker 2>being emotional feel like hallow </v>
<v Speaker 2>gestures?</v>

1087
00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:09.490
<v Speaker 2>It goes on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm president at a bullseye on his head.</v>

1088
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:16.030
<v Speaker 2>You could go to right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus most problem Postville.</v>

1089
00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:21.580
<v Speaker 2>His problem is that he isn't a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>person or even completely untalented.</v>

1090
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks a little towns lists.</v>

1091
00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.510
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll admit this,</v>

1092
00:58:25.511 --> 00:58:28.310
<v Speaker 2>you're not completely on talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1093
00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:33.650
<v Speaker 2>it steady stands for nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think almost in a way could for him,</v>

1094
00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:35.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because music doesn't need to be </v>

1095
00:58:38.291 --> 00:58:42.460
<v Speaker 2>political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not everything needs to be political.</v>

1096
00:58:42.461 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 2>He's an entertainer that's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be an escape.</v>

1097
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:47.283
<v Speaker 2>He can afford to feign the swagger and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool and hip hop when it's convenient </v>

1098
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:53.560
<v Speaker 2>and opt out when it's time to see who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing for the cars.</v>

1099
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:58.600
<v Speaker 2>It's always been a fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>straightforward compact when it comes to</v>

1100
00:58:58.601 --> 00:58:59.434
<v Speaker 2>hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a white person eating off of </v>

1101
00:59:00.761 --> 00:59:02.560
<v Speaker 2>what has historically been black </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

1102
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.170
<v Speaker 2>you have a certain obligation to repay </v>
<v Speaker 2>that creative debt.</v>

1103
00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Eminem continues to attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hypocrisy is and contradictions that</v>

1104
00:59:08.741 --> 00:59:11.830
<v Speaker 2>allowed him to leap frog equally gifted </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>

1105
00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:13.563
<v Speaker 2>That's a strong statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Macklowe or may have lex subtlety or </v>

1106
00:59:16.031 --> 00:59:20.020
<v Speaker 2>rudimentary understanding of when to </v>
<v Speaker 2>share text messages,</v>

1107
00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.010

<v Speaker 4>His dedication to confronting his white </v>
<v Speaker 4>privilege.</v>

1114
00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:47.810
<v Speaker 4>is idiotic currents that have carried us</v>
<v Speaker 4>into this present cultural submersion.</v>

1115
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:51.740
<v Speaker 4>We're an objective notion of the truth </v>
<v Speaker 4>has been systematically muddied.</v>

1116

<v Speaker 4>Come what?</v>

<v Speaker 4>integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dignity or talent can be brazenly </v>

1121
01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:07.760
<v Speaker 4>dismissed as the pitiful cries of </v>
<v Speaker 4>haters.</v>

1122
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:10.340
<v Speaker 4>So congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess who allowed this to happen?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I love how bitter you are.</v>

1129

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1134
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:47.390
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's a point to be made </v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1135
01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:49.183
<v Speaker 4>I'm not agreeing with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I understand if somebody wants to </v>

1136
01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:53.910
<v Speaker 4>make a point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1137
01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:54.883
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

<v Speaker 11>music is vacuum,</v>

1141
01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.100
<v Speaker 11>but one,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you wouldn't be the first person to make</v>

1142
01:01:08.101 --> 01:01:10.290
<v Speaker 11>that point by a long shot.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And two,</v>

1143
01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:12.750
<v Speaker 11>it's not like he's even like the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 11>example of that.</v>

<v Speaker 11>post unfavorably to one direction and </v>

1146

<v Speaker 11>like backstreet boys,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 11>that was just as vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Like their lyrics aren't fucking deep.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'll admit he has some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not without talent.</v>

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy is just a dick.</v>

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:51.370
<v Speaker 4>that's part of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bigger you get as part of the game.</v>

1160
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:56.210
<v Speaker 4>But the good news for Post Malone is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's got a lot of love and a lot of</v>

1161
01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:57.044
<v Speaker 4>fans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's funny you say that because if </v>

1162
01:01:58.731 --> 01:02:03.230
<v Speaker 4>you compare him to his contemporaries </v>
<v Speaker 4>and my opinion has music is a cut above.</v>

1163
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:05.120
<v Speaker 4>It is more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's nicer,</v>

1164
01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:06.490
<v Speaker 4>it's better I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1165
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:10.370
<v Speaker 4>whenever we put like a random playlist </v>
<v Speaker 4>of like top top hits or whatever,</v>

1166
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:13.130
<v Speaker 4>well I can't stand most of them.</v>

1167
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:13.941
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

1168
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:15.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again he,</v>

1169
01:02:15.471 --> 01:02:16.304
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he makes it seem like he owes a debt to </v>

1170
01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:18.853
<v Speaker 4>hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again that's a whole theoretical </v>

1171
01:02:21.121 --> 01:02:21.901
<v Speaker 4>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1172
01:02:21.901 --> 01:02:24.000
<v Speaker 4>But what if you're going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

1173
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:26.070
<v Speaker 4>His genre is not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1174
01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not really a wrap merge of.</v>

1175
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.040
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What actually he does it wrap.</v>

1176
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.353
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said even in the video they say his </v>

1177
01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:36.240
<v Speaker 4>biggest inspirations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bob Dylan.</v>

1178
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:38.843
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's closer to rock and roll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he was like hip hop or rap or like </v>

1179
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.420
<v Speaker 4>rnb maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1180
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:47.250
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

1181
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.380
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there you go.</v>

1182
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:51.690
<v Speaker 4>I read that and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

1183
01:02:51.691 --> 01:02:56.490
<v Speaker 4>this is a dick and he's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is,</v>

1184
01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:57.324
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's so desperate to make it political </v>

1185
01:02:59.160 --> 01:02:59.993
<v Speaker 4>because most of them doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just not a political guy and they </v>

1186
01:03:03.451 --> 01:03:04.320
<v Speaker 4>hate that.</v>

1187
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:08.190
<v Speaker 4>So if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're the problem buddy.</v>

1188
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.510
<v Speaker 4>Musicians are political.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot,</v>

1189
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.170
<v Speaker 4>a lot art mean a lot aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them are a political,</v>

1190
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:17.460
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them just want to stay out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1191
01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:18.323
<v Speaker 4>Well the problem is that he's posed with</v>
<v Speaker 4>guns screw spooky and he's from Texas </v>

1192
01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:25.740
<v Speaker 4>extra spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

1193
01:03:25.741 --> 01:03:29.580
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot do speak,</v>

1194
01:03:29.581 --> 01:03:31.230
<v Speaker 4>but as part of this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1195
01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:36.240
<v Speaker 4>it's so obnoxious man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like let people be a political.</v>

1196
01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:40.680
<v Speaker 4>He can be a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just let him be like,</v>

1197
01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:43.050
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to drag everybody into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fight.</v>

1198
01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.170
<v Speaker 4>If he doesn't care about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it have to force it?</v>

1199
01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.160
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1200
01:03:47.161 --> 01:03:50.490
<v Speaker 4>And he's a young guy too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's focused on music.</v>

1201
01:03:50.491 --> 01:03:55.491
<v Speaker 4>He's not reading about maybe later in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his life maybe he wasn't exactly.</v>

1202
01:03:56.701 --> 01:03:58.320
<v Speaker 4>No one needs to force it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

1203
01:03:58.321 --> 01:04:00.960
<v Speaker 4>he likes guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like again,</v>

1204
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.710
<v Speaker 4>you can be on either side of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>spectrum and be pro.</v>

1205
01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:08.850
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean he's not in favor of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sensible gun laws.</v>

1206
01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:12.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what his political stance </v>
<v Speaker 4>on that is one way or another,</v>

1207
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:16.770
<v Speaker 4>but it's like let some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let people be unpolitical.</v>

1208
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.290
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he votes and maybe he cares about </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics,</v>

1209
01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:20.910
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just fuck.</v>

1210
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Just the people that listened to him </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to chill anyway.</v>

1211
01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:31.350
<v Speaker 4>Spoke enough about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love only love to my boy posts alum.</v>

1212
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:35.340
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't smell.</v>

1213
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.740
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the record,</v>

1214
01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:40.410
<v Speaker 4>he does not stink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to clear that up.</v>

1215
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.200
<v Speaker 4>Let's clear the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smells good?</v>

1216
01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't smelled him.</v>

1217
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:48.640
<v Speaker 4>There's no smell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no suits.</v>

1256
01:06:44.661 --> 01:06:49.661
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen a little bit of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me actually in our audience with</v>

1257
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:53.060
<v Speaker 2>run for the cube really fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for those who aren't.</v>

1258
01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1260
01:06:59.721 --> 01:07:00.554
<v Speaker 2>That's his classic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He only shows his hands green surgical </v>

1261
01:07:03.471 --> 01:07:04.304
<v Speaker 2>gloves and he takes a scalpel and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweezers and dissects them as if they </v>

1262
01:07:09.201 --> 01:07:10.034
<v Speaker 2>were living creatures and the cadence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his voice in the case that he has some </v>

1263
01:07:14.421 --> 01:07:15.680
<v Speaker 2>sadistic pleasure in it.</v>

1264
01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:20.720
<v Speaker 12>Let's see if nice to have a g line.</v>
<v Speaker 12>P like rat glue.</v>

1265
01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.960
<v Speaker 12>My Kanye love.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He's just a strong.</v>

1266
01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:40.370
<v Speaker 12>He's obsessed with eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Be Brain surgery,</v>

1267
01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:46.510
<v Speaker 12>so there you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That is</v>

1268
01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.230
<v Speaker 2>run for the cube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>

1269
01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:54.150
<v Speaker 2>run from the cube was more more accurate</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some cases,</v>

1270
01:07:54.151 --> 01:07:57.090
<v Speaker 2>but with that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chancellor,</v>

1271
01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:00.850
<v Speaker 2>are you ready to play?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1273

<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>

1504
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.410
<v Speaker 4>This is not like a social justice thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

1505
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not my angle here.</v>

1506
01:20:46.321 --> 01:20:49.710
<v Speaker 4>I want to say I'm genuinely confused by </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1507
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:51.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm perplexed.</v>

1508
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.943
<v Speaker 4>I'm vexed in the words of the Great Bob </v>
<v Speaker 4>Weiss who wrote that article about post </v>

1509
01:20:56.701 --> 01:21:00.240
<v Speaker 4>Malone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to be vexed at my concerts,</v>

1510
01:21:04.450 --> 01:21:07.020
<v Speaker 4>like to be like that when I relaxed in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the new music.</v>

1511
01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:12.980
<v Speaker 4>So there's videos on buzzfeed and it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>about a teacher who is suing,</v>

1512
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.473
<v Speaker 4>I believe the age was 13,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still suing her 13 year old student for </v>

1513
01:21:23.041 --> 01:21:27.100
<v Speaker 4>making fun of her in class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1514
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.380
<v Speaker 4>for being gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

1515
01:21:28.381 --> 01:21:30.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard to tell from the video,</v>

1516
01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:34.950
<v Speaker 4>but it's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole story is so strange and I just</v>

1517
01:21:34.951 --> 01:21:35.784
<v Speaker 4>find it strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre that buzzfeed is taking this </v>

1518
01:21:37.831 --> 01:21:39.840
<v Speaker 4>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're doing a journalistic video,</v>

1519
01:21:39.841 --> 01:21:43.080
<v Speaker 4>but it really doesn't answer any </v>
<v Speaker 4>questions and doesn't.</v>

1520
01:21:43.081 --> 01:21:44.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's just,</v>

1521
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:47.010
<v Speaker 4>it's why it's a wild ride that I want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>take you guys on.</v>

1522
01:21:47.011 --> 01:21:49.830
<v Speaker 4>So with that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let us enjoy.</v>

1523
01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:53.580
<v Speaker 4>I was harassed by my student for being </v>
<v Speaker 4>gay on buzzfeed video.</v>

1524
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:55.493
<v Speaker 14>Can you have with your students.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I really care that we accomplished </v>

1525
01:21:57.611 --> 01:21:58.444
<v Speaker 14>whatever we set out to do,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but I'm also the first teacher to </v>

1526
01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.720
<v Speaker 14>volunteer to get a pie to the face or an</v>
<v Speaker 14>egg cracked on my head,</v>

1527
01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:05.573
<v Speaker 14>like whatever it is to reward students.</v>
<v Speaker 14>One of the highlights of my job is the </v>

1528
01:22:08.351 --> 01:22:09.184
<v Speaker 14>fact that I probably laugh cry at least </v>
<v Speaker 14>once a day because the teenagers are </v>

1529
01:22:12.881 --> 01:22:15.220
<v Speaker 14>funny and if you let them be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 14>they're really fun.</v>

1530
01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:21.140
<v Speaker 4>Such she's drinking Pellegrino.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1531
01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.450
<v Speaker 4>That's fancy for a school teacher.</v>

1532
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:33.750
<v Speaker 4>Usually you have to note that she looks </v>
<v Speaker 4>the part.</v>

1533
01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:37.230
<v Speaker 4>You have to note it from them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's up.</v>

1534
01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:40.170
<v Speaker 4>We're all thinking it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just saying she has a.</v>

1535
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.830
<v Speaker 4>She has a cervical look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1536
01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:46.650
<v Speaker 4>moving on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't have to note it.</v>

1537
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:48.343
<v Speaker 4>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were all looking at her and being </v>

1538
01:22:50.161 --> 01:22:50.994
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

1539
01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:52.430
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:55.230
<v Speaker 4>There's something going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's got a specific look,</v>

1541
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:57.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's okay.</v>

1542
01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:03.380
<v Speaker 4>Like if I saw someone walking around and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a Pekichu hat and like a reflective</v>

1543
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:07.090
<v Speaker 4>less than huge pants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

1544
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:07.990
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy's a raver.</v>

1545
01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:12.850
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's got to look.</v>

1546
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:14.673
<v Speaker 4>That's all</v>

1547
01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:18.930
<v Speaker 7>is amy asked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If I'm an eighth grade English teacher,</v>

1548
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:21.120
<v Speaker 7>I've been teaching for about 12 years </v>
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>

1549
01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.553
<v Speaker 4>How the school system,</v>

1550
01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:24.813
<v Speaker 7>knowing that I've impacted a student or </v>
<v Speaker 7>had a good day in the classroom is </v>

1551
01:23:27.941 --> 01:23:32.350
<v Speaker 7>really indescribable because while </v>
<v Speaker 7>education does not necessarily pay well,</v>

1552
01:23:32.351 --> 01:23:33.840
<v Speaker 7>what it does pay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1553
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.190
<v Speaker 7>is knowing that you've had a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 7>impact future generations.</v>

1554
01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:40.420
<v Speaker 7>My goal is always to really understand </v>
<v Speaker 7>where students come from.</v>

1555
01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:41.923
<v Speaker 4>Bear in mind while they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while they're showing this and urbino </v>

1556
01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.490
<v Speaker 4>electron fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

1557
01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:49.650
<v Speaker 4>She's still selling a 13 year old </v>
<v Speaker 4>student [inaudible].</v>

1558
01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:55.780
<v Speaker 4>I just find that those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that dichotomy of those two things.</v>

1559
01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:58.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're assuming a 13 year old.</v>

1560
01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:00.100
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a person,</v>

1561
01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:01.000
<v Speaker 4>not just A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

1562
01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.440
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is so weird.</v>

1563
01:24:02.441 --> 01:24:04.510
<v Speaker 4>I guess because he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he harassed her,</v>

1564
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:08.300
<v Speaker 4>but the examples she gives doesn't seem </v>
<v Speaker 4>that bad.</v>

1565
01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:12.950
<v Speaker 4>It's more like for bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her not harassed I guess.</v>

1566
01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I guess let's,</v>

1567
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:19.060
<v Speaker 4>let's let the do over and apparently it </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't work</v>

1568
01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:19.963
<v Speaker 7>or a grade.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My story begins at the start of the </v>

1569
01:24:21.291 --> 01:24:22.340
<v Speaker 7>2017,</v>
<v Speaker 7>20,</v>

1570
01:24:22.341 --> 01:24:23.174
<v Speaker 7>18 school year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had several students approached me </v>

1571
01:24:25.311 --> 01:24:26.144
<v Speaker 7>privately out of concern to let me know </v>
<v Speaker 7>that a former student of mine who was </v>

1572
01:24:30.291 --> 01:24:33.110
<v Speaker 7>following me on instagram because they </v>
<v Speaker 7>wanted to keep in touch with me,</v>

1573
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:34.243
<v Speaker 7>had taken a photo of me and my partner </v>
<v Speaker 7>and posted it to her instagram and let </v>

1574
01:24:39.051 --> 01:24:42.440
<v Speaker 7>my current students know that I was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Prior to that,</v>

1575
01:24:42.441 --> 01:24:43.274
<v Speaker 7>I had never discussed my sexuality and </v>
<v Speaker 7>the classroom intentionally because I </v>

1576
01:24:45.951 --> 01:24:46.784
<v Speaker 7>know that I teach in a very conservative</v>
<v Speaker 7>climate and it wasn't something that I </v>

1577
01:24:50.121 --> 01:24:52.880
<v Speaker 7>felt I needed to share right off the bat</v>
<v Speaker 7>with students.</v>

1578
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:53.960
<v Speaker 7>As the year progressed,</v>

1579
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:56.143
<v Speaker 4>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody's picture them with their </v>

1580
01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:58.590
<v Speaker 4>partner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1581
01:24:58.591 --> 01:25:02.640
<v Speaker 4>and I can't imagine that's gotta be hard</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be a teacher and you know,</v>

1582
01:25:02.641 --> 01:25:03.474
<v Speaker 4>it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was a kid there was no social </v>

1583
01:25:05.701 --> 01:25:06.534
<v Speaker 4>media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I can only imagine like stocking </v>

1584
01:25:08.611 --> 01:25:09.444
<v Speaker 4>your teacher and taking photos and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>sharing it with all your classmates on </v>

1585
01:25:12.001 --> 01:25:13.140
<v Speaker 4>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like cad.</v>

1586
01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:18.410
<v Speaker 4>That's messed up so kids can be men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So kids are straight up eve,</v>

1587
01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.480
<v Speaker 4>especially 13.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like the most evil age.</v>

1588
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:22.400
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

1589
01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.900
<v Speaker 4>They're all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every 13 year olds have freaking psycho.</v>

1590
01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:26.633
<v Speaker 4>I mean the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The worst thing I ever did do a teacher </v>

1591
01:25:27.961 --> 01:25:30.370
<v Speaker 4>when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was our principal because you</v>

1592
01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:32.700
<v Speaker 4>such a Douche.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We like to Peter's House.</v>

1593
01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:36.180
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that.</v>

1594
01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:39.900
<v Speaker 4>It's not that bad is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't ever done that.</v>

1595
01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:42.510
<v Speaker 4>It's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We followed him home and we're like,</v>

1596
01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:44.560
<v Speaker 4>we found out where he is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to tap as hell.</v>

1597
01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:45.413
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did what they're talking about in </v>

1598
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.160
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took pictures and yeah,</v>

1599
01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:50.003
<v Speaker 4>but there was no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no fucking my space or </v>

1600
01:25:51.661 --> 01:25:52.494
<v Speaker 4>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what did you take photos with a </v>

1601
01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:01.080
<v Speaker 4>camera when I was a kid and then we just</v>
<v Speaker 4>like draw nasty shit on it,</v>

1602
01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.740
<v Speaker 4>make fun of the teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is like amongst friends.</v>

1603
01:26:03.741 --> 01:26:04.574
<v Speaker 4>This is sharing it with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you drew a funny picture of a photo </v>

1604
01:26:07.401 --> 01:26:09.230
<v Speaker 4>and that everyone at the school saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1605
01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:11.390
<v Speaker 4>It just amplifies it times a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1606
01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.700
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so anyway,</v>

1607
01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:14.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sympathizing</v>

1608
01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:19.760
<v Speaker 7>me to let me know that this was really a</v>
<v Speaker 7>hot topic on the Internet.</v>

1609
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.180
<v Speaker 7>It was a hot topic on campus and people </v>
<v Speaker 7>were continuing to discuss it.</v>

1610
01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:25.810
<v Speaker 7>I went to my administration multiple </v>
<v Speaker 7>times</v>

1611
01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:28.100
<v Speaker 4>in this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

1612
01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:31.460
<v Speaker 4>I have a hard time seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be like,</v>

1613
01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.930
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's gay.</v>

1614
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:34.603
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'm wrong though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She says she's scared of area so I </v>

1615
01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:38.900
<v Speaker 4>could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be hard probably,</v>

1616
01:26:38.901 --> 01:26:43.220
<v Speaker 4>but also you're kind of the adult in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

1617
01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.600
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at any rate,</v>

1618
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.280
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not judging her yet.</v>

1619
01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:47.243
<v Speaker 4>Let's watch.</v>

1620
01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.413
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that I was concerned about this and I </v>

1621
01:26:49.681 --> 01:26:50.880
<v Speaker 7>felt like things were getting out of.</v>

1622
01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:55.720
<v Speaker 4>I love the shot of her just walking the </v>
<v Speaker 4>area just like a.</v>

1623
01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:57.653
<v Speaker 7>and the initial response was that this </v>
<v Speaker 7>was the word that was used and that it </v>

1624
01:27:01.801 --> 01:27:04.740
<v Speaker 7>would die down and to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I hope so too.</v>

1625
01:27:04.741 --> 01:27:06.480
<v Speaker 7>Unfortunately that's not what occurred.</v>

1626
01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.193
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she says everyone hoped there was </v>

1627
01:27:09.821 --> 01:27:12.820
<v Speaker 4>drama with die down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's not what occurred.</v>

1628
01:27:12.821 --> 01:27:17.530
<v Speaker 4>So what's leading me to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody like started writing like slurs</v>

1629
01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.760
<v Speaker 4>on the door or like keying her car or </v>
<v Speaker 4>some shit like hate crimes.</v>

1630
01:27:21.761 --> 01:27:24.140
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fix My mic here.</v>

1631
01:27:24.190 --> 01:27:25.750
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's see what happens.</v>

1632
01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:28.933
<v Speaker 7>During that school year,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was also pursuing my master of Arts </v>

1633
01:27:30.801 --> 01:27:31.634
<v Speaker 7>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have to maintain an online youtube </v>

1634
01:27:33.261 --> 01:27:34.094
<v Speaker 7>channel where I responded and reflected </v>
<v Speaker 7>on things that I'd read or activities </v>

1635
01:27:37.971 --> 01:27:38.804
<v Speaker 7>I'd completed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One night I noticed that a flood of </v>

1636
01:27:40.961 --> 01:27:41.794
<v Speaker 7>students started to follow me on that </v>
<v Speaker 7>account and then I received a comment </v>

1637
01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.820
<v Speaker 7>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't be stupid.</v>

1638
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:47.683
<v Speaker 7>Be a smarty.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can join the Nazi party now </v>

1639
01:27:50.091 --> 01:27:51.980
<v Speaker 7>accepting dikes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's good.</v>

1640
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:52.400
<v Speaker 7>Haunt</v>

1641
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.430
<v Speaker 4>this comment on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what she said.</v>

1642
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:56.743
<v Speaker 4>Sadly it didn't end there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had one person write a rude comment </v>

1643
01:28:01.881 --> 01:28:04.430
<v Speaker 4>on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We get like 10 times,</v>

1644
01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:09.140
<v Speaker 4>but especially it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you kidding me?</v>

1645
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:12.800
<v Speaker 4>One every five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every personal,</v>

1646
01:28:12.801 --> 01:28:14.990
<v Speaker 4>every defect I have as a person is </v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently,</v>

1647
01:28:15.170 --> 01:28:18.560
<v Speaker 4>it's almost a relief for me to know that</v>
<v Speaker 4>every negative attribute of my,</v>

1648
01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:19.573
<v Speaker 4>of my personalities because I'm Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that really actually takes the load </v>

1649
01:28:23.751 --> 01:28:24.980
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was just,</v>

1650
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:27.440
<v Speaker 4>I guess I guess I can't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1651
01:28:27.441 --> 01:28:28.740
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I had a,</v>

1652
01:28:28.741 --> 01:28:30.650
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of development and maturing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do,</v>

1653
01:28:30.651 --> 01:28:33.960
<v Speaker 4>but it turns out I'm just a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a relief honestly.</v>

1654
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:37.020
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1655
01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.980
<v Speaker 4>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1656
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.600
<v Speaker 4>What happened is this comment sets her </v>
<v Speaker 4>off down at the bench.</v>

1657
01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:45.670
<v Speaker 4>So weird because it doesn't even seem </v>
<v Speaker 4>personal.</v>

1658
01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.393
<v Speaker 4>Like to honestly honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as someone who's been on the receiving </v>

1659
01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:54.530
<v Speaker 4>end of shitty comments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's not that bad.</v>

1660
01:28:55.130 --> 01:29:00.130
<v Speaker 4>It's not personal and it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of just a stupid thing because</v>

1661
01:29:00.771 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 4>it's like the Nazis</v>

1662
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.380
<v Speaker 2>are accepting dykes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1663
01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:06.480
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just being cheeky.</v>

1664
01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Obviously rude and I entered what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand being upset by it.</v>

1665
01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:10.523
<v Speaker 2>But what happens is it sets her off on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this personal crusade of trying to find </v>

1666
01:29:14.521 --> 01:29:17.700
<v Speaker 2>out who wrote this comment a comment on </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube.</v>

1667
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:21.780
<v Speaker 2>So now she goes on like this war path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what was going on</v>

1668
01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:23.110
<v Speaker 4>my mic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1669
01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:24.483
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

1670
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.390
<v Speaker 2>why is this thing not tight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little droopy did I don't understand.</v>

1671
01:29:28.391 --> 01:29:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Why is it true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got pills for that.</v>

1672
01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:34.970
<v Speaker 4>Where that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1673
01:29:34.971 --> 01:29:35.960
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1674
01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:37.533
<v Speaker 4>Is your mic drooping?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I should do that during our </v>

1675
01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:41.203
<v Speaker 4>testing.</v>

1676
01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Why it's dripping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dripping all over the place,</v>

1677
01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:45.613
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1678
01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:46.863
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>

1679
01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:54.210
<v Speaker 2>This is where the podcast is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good technical issues.</v>

1680
01:29:54.650 --> 01:29:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My exhale.</v>

1681
01:29:56.171 --> 01:29:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1682
01:29:57.431 --> 01:29:58.264
<v Speaker 2>she goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if she just ignored the comment and </v>

1683
01:30:00.371 --> 01:30:01.960
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said it's just drama.</v>

1684
01:30:01.961 --> 01:30:05.650
<v Speaker 2>It'll die down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she goes on this war path to say who</v>

1685
01:30:05.651 --> 01:30:09.640
<v Speaker 2>wrote that comment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this ends up being her demise as far</v>

1686
01:30:09.641 --> 01:30:11.620
<v Speaker 2>as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like here we go.</v>

1687
01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:13.253
<v Speaker 7>I immediately took a screenshot and send</v>
<v Speaker 7>it to my administration and asked them </v>

1688
01:30:16.431 --> 01:30:17.264
<v Speaker 7>to sit down with me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It took my administration month to meet </v>

1689
01:30:19.161 --> 01:30:19.994
<v Speaker 7>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you want me to do with the </v>

1690
01:30:21.711 --> 01:30:22.750
<v Speaker 7>decision was made</v>

1691
01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:27.590
<v Speaker 2>someone at your school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one youtube comment.</v>

1692
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:31.790
<v Speaker 2>So like she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she sent it to the principal and she was</v>

1693
01:30:31.791 --> 01:30:33.650
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't suspended anybody yet,</v>

1694
01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:34.371
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1695
01:30:34.371 --> 01:30:37.010
<v Speaker 2>let it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little app shut up.</v>

1696
01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to play the video about </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerance to presented to the class</v>

1697
01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:41.173
<v Speaker 7>I did that immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sent it off to them and unfortunately </v>

1698
01:30:44.091 --> 01:30:44.924
<v Speaker 7>they decided that they didn't like the </v>
<v Speaker 7>direction of the lesson and I was told </v>

1699
01:30:47.211 --> 01:30:51.290
<v Speaker 7>that it would occur later on what </v>
<v Speaker 7>someone else had a chance to review it.</v>

1700
01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:52.153
<v Speaker 7>I had started to experience some severe </v>
<v Speaker 7>depression and even more severe anxiety </v>

1701
01:30:56.241 --> 01:30:57.074
<v Speaker 7>about being in class because I felt like</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know what was being said about </v>

1702
01:31:00.741 --> 01:31:01.574
<v Speaker 7>me or what was being done and I also </v>
<v Speaker 7>felt like I wasn't being supported or </v>

1703
01:31:04.581 --> 01:31:07.460
<v Speaker 7>kept safe the way that I believe I </v>
<v Speaker 7>deserve to.</v>

1704
01:31:08.050 --> 01:31:10.150
<v Speaker 2>It was this bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one comment.</v>

1705
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Now all the sudden she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

1706
01:31:14.110 --> 01:31:16.450
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's just not the right job </v>
<v Speaker 2>for her.</v>

1707
01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:17.433
<v Speaker 2>Being a teacher is tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to have like really tough skin </v>

1708
01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:22.173
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like we said with their </v>

1709
01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:24.580
<v Speaker 2>middle school teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1710
01:31:24.581 --> 01:31:25.414
<v Speaker 2>he's our fucking brutal man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going in as a gay teacher in a </v>

1711
01:31:29.891 --> 01:31:30.724
<v Speaker 2>conservative area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of have to know this would </v>

1712
01:31:33.071 --> 01:31:38.071
<v Speaker 2>happen and you didn't know and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>purposely kept it.</v>

1713
01:31:38.710 --> 01:31:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1714
01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:42.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a chance that someone will find </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1715
01:31:42.281 --> 01:31:45.490
<v Speaker 2>So I was surprised she was a teacher for</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 years.</v>

1716
01:31:45.491 --> 01:31:49.000
<v Speaker 2>I've never encountered anything like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just find it you,</v>

1717
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:49.843
<v Speaker 2>she said she's tougher toilet and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a meltdown over one youtube comment </v>

1718
01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:53.373
<v Speaker 2>and I just imagined like print the </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying a print of it to the principal </v>

1719
01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.990
<v Speaker 2>and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to do something about this.</v>

1720
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.943
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1721
01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.970
<v Speaker 4>It's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you sympathize,</v>

1722
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:03.000
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you want me to do?</v>

1723
01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Trace the Ip called the cyber police and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>

1724
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:10.810
<v Speaker 4>I can only imagine what that </v>
<v Speaker 4>presentation look like that they vetoed.</v>

1725
01:32:11.690 --> 01:32:14.140
<v Speaker 4>They're probably just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is weird.</v>

1726
01:32:14.141 --> 01:32:18.710
<v Speaker 4>You're going to make a presentation over</v>
<v Speaker 4>one random comment and also you're going</v>

1727
01:32:18.711 --> 01:32:19.670
<v Speaker 4>to get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1728
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:22.000
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody.</v>

1729
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.133
<v Speaker 4>I saw this comment calling me a dyke and</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that the Nazi party is accepting </v>

1730
01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:32.100
<v Speaker 4>and I want to know who was it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I put together a presentation that's</v>

1731
01:32:32.651 --> 01:32:33.484
<v Speaker 4>like inviting the old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't feed the trolls as they famously </v>

1732
01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:43.160
<v Speaker 4>saved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1733
01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:45.773
<v Speaker 4>By the</v>

1734
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:49.800
<v Speaker 7>I asked my students to those shots Topia</v>
<v Speaker 7>during a presentation,</v>

1735
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:53.280
<v Speaker 7>one of my students made some disparaging</v>
<v Speaker 7>comments about gay marriage,</v>

1736
01:32:53.281 --> 01:32:55.830
<v Speaker 7>which elicited quite a response from my </v>
<v Speaker 7>students,</v>

1737
01:32:56.190 --> 01:33:00.780
<v Speaker 7>a lot of excitement and looking at me </v>
<v Speaker 7>and definitely awaiting a reaction after</v>

1738
01:33:00.781 --> 01:33:01.614
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Upon reviewing the student's written </v>

1739
01:33:02.701 --> 01:33:03.534
<v Speaker 7>work,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I noticed that some more derogatory </v>

1740
01:33:05.551 --> 01:33:10.551
<v Speaker 7>comments were used about gay people in </v>
<v Speaker 7>her work and I brought that again to the</v>

1741
01:33:10.771 --> 01:33:15.771
<v Speaker 7>attention of my administration and my </v>
<v Speaker 7>administrators felt like the best course</v>

1742
01:33:15.961 --> 01:33:18.090
<v Speaker 7>of action.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was simply a teachable moment.</v>

1743
01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.193
<v Speaker 7>I contacted my union at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>From there it escalated to me getting a </v>

1744
01:33:23.071 --> 01:33:26.020
<v Speaker 7>regional rep involved from my union who </v>
<v Speaker 7>eventually hired me.</v>

1745
01:33:26.021 --> 01:33:26.854
<v Speaker 7>A lawyer.</v>

1746
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:32.850
<v Speaker 4>Just imagine wanting to expel a student.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're ruining.</v>

1747
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:35.890
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to ruin the kids alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're the adult.</v>

1748
01:33:36.190 --> 01:33:39.160
<v Speaker 4>I know they said something really mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>and rude and homophobic.</v>

1749
01:33:39.190 --> 01:33:40.180
<v Speaker 4>The 13.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1750
01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:41.014
<v Speaker 4>They're pretty ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like if she took it in a </v>

1751
01:33:42.671 --> 01:33:44.180
<v Speaker 4>different way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe she.</v>

1752
01:33:45.010 --> 01:33:45.843
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe she could have turned it into </v>

1753
01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:51.400
<v Speaker 4>exactly something that would teach them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you be tolerant about it.</v>

1754
01:33:51.401 --> 01:33:51.950
<v Speaker 4>What did you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did,</v>

1755
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Speaker 4>why did you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>

1756
01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:54.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

1757
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:56.630
<v Speaker 4>And then the principal actually seems </v>
<v Speaker 4>like pretty cool,</v>

1758
01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:59.860
<v Speaker 4>like even headed about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like wanting like what is she?</v>

1759
01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:02.230
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this person wrote something homophobic.</v>

1760
01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:03.843
<v Speaker 4>She's like out for blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you have to expect like the fuck </v>

1761
01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going after a kid man.</v>

1762
01:34:10.751 --> 01:34:14.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean they didn't threaten her or do </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything like totally insane.</v>

1763
01:34:14.261 --> 01:34:15.094
<v Speaker 4>And then the realm of normal child </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior to be a Douche due to anxiety </v>

1764
01:34:21.941 --> 01:34:22.774
<v Speaker 4>and depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amy took a mental health leave from </v>

1765
01:34:24.521 --> 01:34:25.354
<v Speaker 4>teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her case is currently being litigated </v>

1766
01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.573
<v Speaker 4>for what?</v>

1767
01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:32.193
<v Speaker 7>I haven't been in the classroom since </v>
<v Speaker 7>January and I would say that there are </v>

1768
01:34:34.661 --> 01:34:36.910
<v Speaker 7>two things that I missed the most.</v>
<v Speaker 7>First and foremost,</v>

1769
01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.950
<v Speaker 4>I love my colleagues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am lucky to work man.</v>

1770
01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:44.450
<v Speaker 4>It's like a commercial for depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's just out there picking grass.</v>

1771
01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:48.980
<v Speaker 4>She's not in the classroom anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck</v>

1772
01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:51.483
<v Speaker 7>incredible educators in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 7>students and very sad that I didn't get </v>

1773
01:34:54.311 --> 01:34:55.144
<v Speaker 7>to read Fahrenheit 4:51</v>
<v Speaker 7>with them or be there for their eighth </v>

1774
01:34:57.711 --> 01:34:58.430
<v Speaker 7>grade graduation.</v>

1775
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:01.820
<v Speaker 14>It was really challenging for me to miss</v>
<v Speaker 14>out on both of those things.</v>

1776
01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:04.820
<v Speaker 14>I don't feel frustration or anger </v>
<v Speaker 14>towards students.</v>

1777
01:35:04.821 --> 01:35:05.840
<v Speaker 14>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 14>um,</v>

1778
01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.600
<v Speaker 14>as teenagers we're always,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

1779
01:35:08.601 --> 01:35:11.600
<v Speaker 14>they're growing and they're changing and</v>
<v Speaker 14>they're formulating their own opinions.</v>

1780
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:15.980
<v Speaker 14>The onus really lies on the adults in </v>
<v Speaker 14>the system to do better.</v>

1781
01:35:15.981 --> 01:35:18.740
<v Speaker 14>And that's what I feel most disappointed</v>
<v Speaker 14>in.</v>

1782
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:22.970
<v Speaker 14>I don't even feel anger towards the </v>
<v Speaker 14>adults in this situation.</v>

1783
01:35:22.971 --> 01:35:23.840
<v Speaker 14>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>

1784
01:35:23.841 --> 01:35:27.400
<v Speaker 14>my ultimate hope is that everyone learns</v>
<v Speaker 14>and grows so that we understand that,</v>

1785
01:35:27.410 --> 01:35:27.620
<v Speaker 14>that</v>

1786
01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:31.190
<v Speaker 4>close up man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buzzfeed shots way to close up,</v>

1787
01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:35.720
<v Speaker 4>show me the ear and Jiggling and picking</v>
<v Speaker 4>grass</v>

1788
01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.390
<v Speaker 14>next time.</v>
<v Speaker 14>A situation like this occurs.</v>

1789
01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.130
<v Speaker 14>We create a culture where</v>

1790
01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:46.200
<v Speaker 4>she's got a job up per of plural feed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you call that?</v>

1791
01:35:46.301 --> 01:35:47.500

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're not the only one that's partnered</v>

1797
01:36:01.330 --> 01:36:02.163
<v Speaker 4>for life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>baby</v>

1798
01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.990
<v Speaker 14>excepted and doesn't happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Oh,</v>

1799
01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:05.873
<v Speaker 14>you walked at a screen.</v>

1800
01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.650
<v Speaker 4>We reached out to amy school for </v>
<v Speaker 4>comment.</v>

1801
01:36:08.651 --> 01:36:10.990
<v Speaker 4>We include an excerpt from the response </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the description.</v>

1802
01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:15.340
<v Speaker 4>You didn't want to show it to too many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1803
01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:16.090
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so she.</v>

1804
01:36:16.090 --> 01:36:18.760
<v Speaker 4>She's suing the school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the student.</v>

1805
01:36:18.910 --> 01:36:20.450
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Am I understanding that correctly?</v>

1806
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was the student,</v>

1807
01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:24.520
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't actually say it says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1808
01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:25.980
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says [inaudible].</v>

1809
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:28.920
<v Speaker 4>Litigation is ongoing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would think it's.</v>

1810
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:31.330
<v Speaker 4>If anything it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why I thought it was a kid.</v>

1811
01:36:31.331 --> 01:36:33.880
<v Speaker 4>I remember reading that somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I am an idiot.</v>

1812
01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:36.450
<v Speaker 4>I just don't understand what the school </v>
<v Speaker 4>could have done.</v>

1813
01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:39.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand what the litigating </v>
<v Speaker 4>is for.</v>

1814
01:36:39.850 --> 01:36:40.683
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even understand why this is a </v>

1815
01:36:43.271 --> 01:36:44.620
<v Speaker 4>video at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1816
01:36:44.770 --> 01:36:49.360
<v Speaker 4>like there's no story here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is her making a youtube channel even</v>

1817
01:36:49.361 --> 01:36:51.880
<v Speaker 4>under the responsibility of the school?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

1818
01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:52.953
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1819
01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.420
<v Speaker 4>It's youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do people can find your videos.</v>

1820
01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:57.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And did she say she was a.</v>

1821
01:36:57.460 --> 01:36:58.293
<v Speaker 4>She made the youtube channel for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>master's degree that she was trying to </v>

1822
01:37:01.031 --> 01:37:02.870
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is like an extra trip.</v>

1823
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:04.840
<v Speaker 4>This doesn't even have to do with her </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

1824
01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:08.980
<v Speaker 4>How does she even know it was a student </v>
<v Speaker 4>who made don't know.</v>

1825
01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:13.540
<v Speaker 4>Here's a statement from a school's </v>
<v Speaker 4>boring.</v>

1826
01:37:13.541 --> 01:37:17.650
<v Speaker 4>It's very just what you would expect to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be very illegal,</v>

1827
01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.660
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1828
01:37:19.661 --> 01:37:23.680
<v Speaker 4>I wonder why this video even exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no information.</v>

1829
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:26.440
<v Speaker 4>Nothing happened as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1830
01:37:26.441 --> 01:37:27.274
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you trying to prove with this </v>

1831
01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:30.340
<v Speaker 4>video?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's out there.</v>

1832
01:37:30.341 --> 01:37:33.430
<v Speaker 4>Kids are assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's it.</v>

1833
01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.760
<v Speaker 4>She got us good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1834
01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:42.400
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This Day and age,</v>

1835
01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.470
<v Speaker 4>I was such a dick to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My teachers.</v>

1836
01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:49.320
<v Speaker 4>Definitely took,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1837
01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.230
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1838
01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:51.760

<v Speaker 4>they were adults about it.</v>

1839
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:52.623
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just moved on every time some one of </v>

01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.710
<v Speaker 2>their life ruined and them to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>expelled from school.</v>

1843
01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Had to have to switch schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them in prison.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want them at juvenile hall for any </v>
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>

1845

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1961
01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:31.370
<v Speaker 15>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I think he's trying to,</v>

1962
01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:35.330
<v Speaker 15>um,</v>
<v Speaker 15>which is what I've said before.</v>

1963
01:43:35.690 --> 01:43:40.690
<v Speaker 15>He's not like a heavy political guy.</v>
<v Speaker 15>A lot of this is kind of vague too.</v>

1964
01:43:40.701 --> 01:43:42.440
<v Speaker 15>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>

1965
01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:43.333
<v Speaker 15>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I support holding people misuse their </v>

1966
01:43:44.931 --> 01:43:47.870
<v Speaker 15>power accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 15>That's like a fun thing to say,</v>

1967
01:43:47.871 --> 01:43:49.340
<v Speaker 15>but I don't know what that means.</v>

1968
01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:53.680
<v Speaker 4>I see it as me too stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1969
01:43:53.890 --> 01:43:56.550
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or like Wall Street stuff too.</v>

1970
01:43:57.010 --> 01:43:57.843
<v Speaker 4>But regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does heat up as he lives a lot of </v>

1971
01:44:00.591 --> 01:44:02.380
<v Speaker 4>room for interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does d dot,</v>

1972
01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:04.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

1973
01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:08.440
<v Speaker 4>So here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now there was a thing called black.</v>

1974
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:09.770
<v Speaker 4>What is blood exit in?</v>

1975
01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:13.680
<v Speaker 15>He's had this woman around him for a </v>
<v Speaker 15>while called Candice Owens.</v>

1976
01:44:13.710 --> 01:44:14.543
<v Speaker 15>She's kind of a right leaning political </v>
<v Speaker 15>figure and she's been very close with </v>

1977
01:44:20.491 --> 01:44:21.324
<v Speaker 15>him kind of ever since he put the hat on</v>
<v Speaker 15>and like in his circle going wherever </v>

1978
01:44:27.361 --> 01:44:28.860
<v Speaker 15>he's going,</v>
<v Speaker 15>she's always around.</v>

1979
01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:32.160
<v Speaker 15>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So she has this thing called black set.</v>

1980
01:44:32.970 --> 01:44:34.380
<v Speaker 15>I hate saying the word,</v>

1981
01:44:35.010 --> 01:44:38.080
<v Speaker 4>it's not a good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a,</v>

1982
01:44:38.130 --> 01:44:41.160
<v Speaker 4>how do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A elegant to say no legs.</v>

1983
01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.810
<v Speaker 4>It blacks it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1984
01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:45.120
<v Speaker 4>Black say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean that's,</v>

1985
01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:48.260
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to like combine the two</v>
<v Speaker 4>words that actually makes brexit.</v>

1986
01:44:48.261 --> 01:44:50.200
<v Speaker 4>It's a play on brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1987
01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:52.930
<v Speaker 4>Well because you need an exit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the equity.</v>

1988
01:44:54.430 --> 01:44:55.330
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1989
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:59.980
<v Speaker 15>it's like the black exit from the </v>
<v Speaker 15>Democratic Party is what she wants.</v>

1990
01:44:59.981 --> 01:45:03.460
<v Speaker 15>She wants everyone to leave and mass.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And uh,</v>

1991
01:45:03.970 --> 01:45:08.970
<v Speaker 15>so she put out merge and told people </v>
<v Speaker 15>that Kanye designed it.</v>

1992
01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:11.073
<v Speaker 15>And I think that was kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 15>breaking point which sparked all of </v>

1993
01:45:14.081 --> 01:45:14.540
<v Speaker 15>this.</v>

1994
01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:17.690
<v Speaker 4>Here's the logo and question actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1995
01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:22.130
<v Speaker 4>and also I will say not a very well </v>
<v Speaker 4>designed a.</v>

1996
01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:26.750
<v Speaker 4>looks like someone's being crucified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Jim Merge.</v>

1997
01:45:26.850 --> 01:45:27.683
<v Speaker 15>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it looks like some of my camp counselor </v>

1998
01:45:29.431 --> 01:45:30.250
<v Speaker 15>would wear and</v>

1999
01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:31.810
<v Speaker 4>not very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not very spicy.</v>

2000
01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:33.410
<v Speaker 15>No,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's not great.</v>

2001
01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:37.190
<v Speaker 15>And so after that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 15>he came out and was like,</v>

2002
01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:38.250
<v Speaker 15>no,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I,</v>

2003
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:39.410
<v Speaker 15>I didn't do that.</v>

2004
01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:40.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're,</v>

2005
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:42.060
<v Speaker 4>you had an interesting theory about.</v>

2006
01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:44.161
<v Speaker 15>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 15>yeah,</v>

2007
01:45:44.161 --> 01:45:45.810
<v Speaker 15>all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Everyone thinks,</v>

2008
01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:46.440
<v Speaker 15>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 15>he's like,</v>

2009
01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.430
<v Speaker 15>come to his senses.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Oh,</v>

2010
01:45:47.431 --> 01:45:48.264
<v Speaker 15>he's realized the error of his ways.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I think he just didn't want to be </v>

2011
01:45:52.201 --> 01:45:53.860
<v Speaker 15>associated with a shitty design.</v>

2012
01:45:53.890 --> 01:45:55.320
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that he's like,</v>

2013
01:45:55.321 --> 01:45:57.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm not offended at all by your </v>
<v Speaker 4>political beliefs.</v>

2014
01:45:57.151 --> 01:45:57.984
<v Speaker 4>I just asked Shit Week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want anyone to think that I put </v>

2015
01:46:00.751 --> 01:46:01.770
<v Speaker 4>my name on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2016
01:46:01.771 --> 01:46:02.604
<v Speaker 4>What he said in response to this design </v>
<v Speaker 4>was actually something that has got a </v>

2017
01:46:06.511 --> 01:46:09.770
<v Speaker 4>lot of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people interacted with us.</v>

2018
01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:12.420
<v Speaker 4>We'd have like hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>likes and retweets.</v>

2019
01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:15.060
<v Speaker 4>And here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2020
01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:16.553
<v Speaker 4>my eyes are now open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I now realized I've been used to </v>

2021
01:46:18.871 --> 01:46:20.990
<v Speaker 4>spread messages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not believe in.</v>

2022
01:46:21.330 --> 01:46:22.163
<v Speaker 4>I'm distancing myself from politics and </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely focusing on being creative </v>

2023
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:28.800
<v Speaker 4>and that Brexit logo was whack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2024
01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.310
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the one before he didn't so well.</v>

2025
01:46:32.311 --> 01:46:35.430
<v Speaker 4>He said essentially he had nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

2026
01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:38.640
<v Speaker 4>So what do you make of this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this a genuine.</v>

2027
01:46:38.641 --> 01:46:42.570
<v Speaker 4>And when this came out I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately started everywhere.</v>

2028
01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:44.820
<v Speaker 4>Like everyone thinking that it's about </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump.</v>

2029
01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:46.013
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's what I assumed that it was </v>

2030
01:46:47.341 --> 01:46:48.330
<v Speaker 4>about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey.</v>

2031
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's really</v>

2032
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.250
<v Speaker 15>the only assumption that make really.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Well that's why.</v>

2033
01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:53.093
<v Speaker 15>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 15>the so many likes and everyone </v>

2034
01:46:54.391 --> 01:46:56.040
<v Speaker 15>immediately went,</v>
<v Speaker 15>oh fine.</v>

2035
01:46:56.041 --> 01:46:57.870
<v Speaker 15>So he's back to,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>

2036
01:46:58.650 --> 01:46:59.483
<v Speaker 15>just chilling out.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And that means he doesn't like </v>

2037
01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:02.950
<v Speaker 15>Republicans at all.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I think that was,</v>

2038
01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:03.893
<v Speaker 15>we both jumped in,</v>
<v Speaker 15>which isn't the case because he </v>

2039
01:47:06.061 --> 01:47:08.610
<v Speaker 15>clarified with TMZ,</v>
<v Speaker 15>which is the next thing,</v>

2040
01:47:09.090 --> 01:47:10.410
<v Speaker 15>but his statements.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So dramatic.</v>

2041
01:47:10.570 --> 01:47:11.403
<v Speaker 15>My,</v>
<v Speaker 15>how could it mean anything else when he </v>

2042
01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:16.140
<v Speaker 15>says my eyes are now wide open,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's like I've just,</v>

2043
01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:20.160
<v Speaker 15>I've been awakened to this great.</v>
<v Speaker 15>A misfortune,</v>

2044
01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:21.023
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I think it goes back to like with the </v>

2045
01:47:22.711 --> 01:47:26.130
<v Speaker 15>first few tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I think he does it on purpose.</v>

2046
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:31.590
<v Speaker 15>He leaves things vague and interesting </v>
<v Speaker 15>to hear.</v>

2047
01:47:31.591 --> 01:47:33.720
<v Speaker 15>We have a,</v>
<v Speaker 15>what do we have here this,</v>

2048
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:34.583
<v Speaker 15>so this is from the TMZ article.</v>
<v Speaker 15>They reported it and their headline was </v>

2049
01:47:37.351 --> 01:47:38.184
<v Speaker 15>something like Kanye has done with trump</v>
<v Speaker 15>and then he reached out to tmz right </v>

2050
01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:43.673
<v Speaker 15>away and it said Kanye contacted us to </v>
<v Speaker 15>make it clear he did not mention Donald </v>

2051
01:47:47.461 --> 01:47:48.294
<v Speaker 15>trump and his tweets and he's getting </v>
<v Speaker 15>out of politics altogether as for being </v>

2052
01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:51.720
<v Speaker 15>used.</v>

2053
01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:54.900
<v Speaker 15>He says he was specifically ref </v>
<v Speaker 15>referencing blacks and that's it.</v>

2054
01:47:55.770 --> 01:47:59.580
<v Speaker 15>So interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So it kind of.</v>

2055
01:47:59.610 --> 01:48:01.140
<v Speaker 15>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Is there a more,</v>

2056
01:48:01.290 --> 01:48:02.370
<v Speaker 15>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>

2057
01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.410
<v Speaker 15>there isn't more.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Well,</v>

2058
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:06.423
<v Speaker 15>just more.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Is there anything genuine going on here </v>

2059
01:48:09.601 --> 01:48:14.460
<v Speaker 15>or is this just more of kind of this </v>
<v Speaker 15>Kanye trying to drum up attention?</v>

2060
01:48:14.610 --> 01:48:17.070
<v Speaker 15>What do you make of this?</v>
<v Speaker 15>He's what's happening here.</v>

2061
01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:20.540
<v Speaker 15>In part I think the honorary,</v>
<v Speaker 15>a moderator of our continent,</v>

2062
01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:23.760
<v Speaker 15>speaking for the subreddit Kanye Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 15>No,</v>

2063
01:48:23.761 --> 01:48:24.594
<v Speaker 15>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I think that this may be why I have the </v>

2064
01:48:27.451 --> 01:48:28.770
<v Speaker 15>flu.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I'm like,</v>

2065
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:31.860
<v Speaker 15>I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I'm worn out,</v>

2066
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:34.620
<v Speaker 15>I mean it just,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I just want the album at this point,</v>

2067
01:48:34.730 --> 01:48:36.230
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's,</v>

2068
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:38.250
<v Speaker 15>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's 20 days away,</v>

2069
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:39.510
<v Speaker 15>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 15>Well,</v>

2070
01:48:39.630 --> 01:48:42.110
<v Speaker 15>if he's got a lot of work those out,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I don't know.</v>

2071
01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:45.930
<v Speaker 15>And then I can't take what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I don't know if he means it.</v>

2072
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.490
<v Speaker 15>Like when he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I'm done with politics,</v>

2073
01:48:47.491 --> 01:48:48.324
<v Speaker 15>maybe that's this week and then he's </v>
<v Speaker 15>going to debut it and he's gonna have </v>

2074
01:48:51.031 --> 01:48:53.730
<v Speaker 15>the Maggot hat on again.</v>
<v Speaker 15>You know,</v>

2075
01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:57.380
<v Speaker 15>it seems that that's a common theme.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 15>It seems to be a common segment among </v>

2078
01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:04.133
<v Speaker 15>his,</v>
<v Speaker 15>a sentiment among his fans that it's </v>

2079
01:49:06.011 --> 01:49:08.880
<v Speaker 15>like we're getting tired of this.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Just give us the music.</v>

2080
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:11.000
<v Speaker 15>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And I,</v>

2081
01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:14.640
<v Speaker 15>and I don't also,</v>
<v Speaker 15>he can believe whatever.</v>

2082
01:49:14.641 --> 01:49:16.770
<v Speaker 15>I don't care about that,</v>
<v Speaker 15>but you know,</v>

2083
01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.360
<v Speaker 15>keeping track of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Like you said,</v>

2084
01:49:18.361 --> 01:49:20.070
<v Speaker 15>it's like this whirlwind,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's nonstop.</v>

2085
01:49:20.670 --> 01:49:24.170
<v Speaker 15>He's always in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 15>There's always things going on in it.</v>

2086
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:25.940
<v Speaker 15>It's kind of tiring.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Right.</v>

2087
01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:27.203
<v Speaker 15>Also there was a thing this week when </v>
<v Speaker 15>easy as being like available for </v>

2088
01:49:30.631 --> 01:49:32.370
<v Speaker 15>everyone now where you're following </v>
<v Speaker 15>that.</v>

2089
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:33.263
<v Speaker 15>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 15>he because he said a while ago that he </v>

2090
01:49:35.971 --> 01:49:40.971
<v Speaker 15>wants eventually to make it available </v>
<v Speaker 15>for everyone that's production cells out</v>

2091
01:49:41.761 --> 01:49:43.410
<v Speaker 15>and then you're going to go to resell </v>
<v Speaker 15>this.</v>

2092
01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:46.710
<v Speaker 15>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So now I think it was available,</v>

2093
01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:48.093
<v Speaker 15>but then people were reporting that it's</v>
<v Speaker 15>not doing that well and they wonder if </v>

2094
01:49:50.801 --> 01:49:55.230
<v Speaker 15>it's because of the drama or which one.</v>
<v Speaker 15>All of the past models are the new black</v>

2095
01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.920
<v Speaker 15>one,</v>
<v Speaker 15>two models.</v>

2096
01:49:57.540 --> 01:49:58.373
<v Speaker 15>The last,</v>
<v Speaker 15>the release before the last one was the </v>

2097
01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:03.700
<v Speaker 15>biggest one he's ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 15>He's the most wide release ever,</v>

2098
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:07.000
<v Speaker 15>so there were going to be shoes </v>
<v Speaker 15>available,</v>

2099
01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:10.900
<v Speaker 15>but people took that as oh everyone </v>
<v Speaker 15>hates Kanye now buying them.</v>

2100
01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:16.000
<v Speaker 15>It's just that's the most they've ever </v>
<v Speaker 15>made and I think it's the same case with</v>

2101
01:50:16.001 --> 01:50:17.530
<v Speaker 15>the new release to.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Got It.</v>

2102
01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.170
<v Speaker 15>But I did see a few people reporting.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Oh yeah,</v>

2103
01:50:20.171 --> 01:50:23.010
<v Speaker 15>that's because everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Well you are wearing a pair,</v>

2104
01:50:23.050 --> 01:50:24.330
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>not right now.</v>

2105
01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:25.173
<v Speaker 15>Not right now.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Okay.</v>

2106
01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:26.113
<v Speaker 15>Well Ian has already closed,</v>
<v Speaker 15>like easiest are fundamentally for </v>

2107
01:50:28.691 --> 01:50:31.540
<v Speaker 15>everyone and no one cares.</v>
<v Speaker 15>You don't care.</v>

2108
01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:35.200
<v Speaker 15>And then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 15>they make it about politics of course.</v>

2109
01:50:35.201 --> 01:50:35.921
<v Speaker 15>And there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Well,</v>

2110
01:50:35.921 --> 01:50:37.600
<v Speaker 15>Kanye is political,</v>
<v Speaker 15>so I guess,</v>

2111
01:50:37.601 --> 01:50:42.601
<v Speaker 15>but you know.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Well we thank you for keeping us updated</v>

2112
01:50:43.001 --> 01:50:43.900
<v Speaker 15>on the world of coming.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Yeah,</v>

2113
01:50:43.901 --> 01:50:45.310
<v Speaker 15>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 15>It's complicated stuff.</v>

2114
01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:50.340
<v Speaker 15>Keeping up with the Kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 15>It is pretty much.</v>

2115
01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:51.433
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that Ken's reality stardom </v>
<v Speaker 2>has affected Kanye in the sense that he </v>

2116
01:50:55.401 --> 01:50:56.480
<v Speaker 2>saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2117
01:50:56.481 --> 01:50:57.314
<v Speaker 2>keeping up with the Kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody cares about this kind of real </v>

2118
01:50:59.451 --> 01:51:00.284
<v Speaker 2>life drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that something that maybe lead off </v>

2119
01:51:02.121 --> 01:51:02.954
<v Speaker 2>into Kanye?</v>

2120
01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:04.513
<v Speaker 15>No,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I think he's always had a talent for </v>

2121
01:51:06.381 --> 01:51:09.290
<v Speaker 15>this and I think that's why they're so </v>
<v Speaker 15>great.</v>

2122
01:51:09.410 --> 01:51:12.120
<v Speaker 15>They're just these marketing machines.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Yeah.</v>

2123
01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:14.270
<v Speaker 15>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's powerful.</v>

<v Speaker 2>great little clip.</v>

2140
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of funny because this guy's</v>

01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:14.840
<v Speaker 2>not even a big streamer.</v>

01:52:15.590 --> 01:52:20.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not even a big streamer.</v>

2144
01:52:20.181 --> 01:52:22.610
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2145
01:52:22.611 --> 01:52:24.950
<v Speaker 2>This twitter clip has over 3 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>views,</v>

2146
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:27.703
<v Speaker 2>but because what he says is just so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's a twitch streamer that has </v>

2147
01:52:30.741 --> 01:52:33.200
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2148
01:52:33.201 --> 01:52:36.320

<v Speaker 2>but he has got like 5,000</v>

2149
01:52:36.321 --> 01:52:38.900
<v Speaker 2>twitter followers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So man</v>

2150
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:43.530
<v Speaker 15>for streamers that I want to relate to </v>
<v Speaker 15>them.</v>

2151
01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 15>I want them to be witty.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I want them to be cool.</v>

2152
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.940
<v Speaker 14>I want them to have that unique aspect </v>
<v Speaker 14>that all of us strive to have.</v>

2153
01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:51.273
<v Speaker 14>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but I need there to be a little bit of </v>

2154
01:52:52.751 --> 01:52:52.880
<v Speaker 14>time</v>

2155
01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:53.713
<v Speaker 4>coughing super loud in the mic because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep turning away that I want to make </v>

2156
01:52:55.731 --> 01:52:57.020
<v Speaker 4>sure I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're raping everybody.</v>

2157
01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.560
<v Speaker 4>It's helping turn more if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2158
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:04.730
<v Speaker 14>Or relationship because I don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 14>talk to a fucking wall.</v>

2159
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:06.160
<v Speaker 14>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 14>But will,</v>

2160
01:53:06.170 --> 01:53:07.003
<v Speaker 14>part of the thing for me is,</v>
<v Speaker 14>is I specifically don't want my viewers </v>

2161
01:53:09.651 --> 01:53:11.380
<v Speaker 14>to have any kind of relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 14>me.</v>

2162
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:13.070
<v Speaker 14>So like that's like it kind of works </v>
<v Speaker 14>out,</v>

2163
01:53:13.071 --> 01:53:13.904
<v Speaker 14>right?</v>
<v Speaker 14>I'm Kinda like I'm hitting my goal but </v>

2164
01:53:15.171 --> 01:53:16.004
<v Speaker 14>I'm,</v>

2165
01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:21.350
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of a bad strategy which I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know I kind of,</v>

2166
01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:25.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing a live stream and I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be connected to anybody.</v>

2167
01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:26.653
<v Speaker 4>Maybe make videos.</v>

2168
01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:28.540
<v Speaker 14>No,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you totally are.</v>

2169
01:53:29.190 --> 01:53:30.610
<v Speaker 14>And as weird as that sounds and it's </v>
<v Speaker 14>like,</v>

2170
01:53:31.090 --> 01:53:31.923
<v Speaker 14>it's kind of like low key like God </v>
<v Speaker 14>complex kind of thing is I don't feel </v>

2171
01:53:36.011 --> 01:53:39.040
<v Speaker 14>like many of my viewers should relate </v>
<v Speaker 14>themselves to me because.</v>

2172
01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:40.353
<v Speaker 14>And this is like super,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like Kinda like I got caught like kinda </v>

2173
01:53:43.321 --> 01:53:45.730
<v Speaker 14>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 14>It's like I do think of myself as better</v>

2174
01:53:45.731 --> 01:53:48.250
<v Speaker 14>than,</v>
<v Speaker 14>or not better but like bigger.</v>

2175
01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:50.800
<v Speaker 14>This is going so there's no good way to </v>
<v Speaker 14>say this.</v>

2176
01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:53.380
<v Speaker 14>I think of myself as like above the </v>
<v Speaker 14>average person,</v>

2177
01:53:53.381 --> 01:53:57.130
<v Speaker 14>so I don't feel like many people could </v>
<v Speaker 14>relate to me as like bad as that sounds.</v>

2178
01:53:57.131 --> 01:53:57.964
<v Speaker 14>I know why.</v>

2179
01:54:02.630 --> 01:54:07.630
<v Speaker 4>Like what would even if you're so </v>
<v Speaker 4>superior and intelligent and like a 2:20</v>

2180
01:54:07.690 --> 01:54:10.260
<v Speaker 4>Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge rick and morty fan.</v>

2181
01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:14.070
<v Speaker 4>Why would you think that was a good idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say?</v>

2182
01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:20.420
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like such a prick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just a fucking like ta also.</v>

2183
01:54:21.061 --> 01:54:21.894
<v Speaker 4>He's like not even a big deal on twitch </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's nice just pulled up the social </v>

2184
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:27.690
<v Speaker 4>worker who's got like 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>followers.</v>

2185
01:54:28.230 --> 01:54:29.063
<v Speaker 4>I just want to say I just want to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and I don't want you to take the </v>

2186
01:54:31.501 --> 01:54:33.450
<v Speaker 4>wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do have 11,000</v>

2187
01:54:33.451 --> 01:54:37.320
<v Speaker 4>followers on twitter and I do think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again this comes off bad,</v>

2188
01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:38.333
<v Speaker 4>but I am superior in every way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean how many followers you have on </v>

2189
01:54:42.601 --> 01:54:43.800

<v Speaker 4>Like 200.</v>

2191
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:48.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean case in point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking pathetic.</v>

2192
01:54:49.410 --> 01:54:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy got reamed for this video.</v>

2193
01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:55.590
<v Speaker 4>How did you think that that could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything worth saying?</v>

2194
01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:56.453
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like how he keeps referring to it as </v>

2195
01:54:57.361 --> 01:55:00.420
<v Speaker 4>like a gum God complex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>low key God complex.</v>

2196
01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:02.670
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that he knows that it sounds bad,</v>

2197
01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:03.291
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2198
01:55:03.291 --> 01:55:06.620
<v Speaker 4>it did because it is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can say that like what are you doing?</v>

2199
01:55:06.630 --> 01:55:07.463
<v Speaker 4>But I feel like he's flattering himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way of like saying he has a god </v>

2200
01:55:10.741 --> 01:55:13.760
<v Speaker 4>complex too because again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>

2201
01:55:13.761 --> 01:55:14.594
<v Speaker 4>you're not even justify.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't even have a god complex when </v>

2202
01:55:16.591 --> 01:55:18.150
<v Speaker 4>you have 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter followers.</v>

2203
01:55:20.190 --> 01:55:23.760
<v Speaker 4>Like imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that guy's a god.</v>

2204
01:55:25.410 --> 01:55:26.243
<v Speaker 4>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so.</v>

2205
01:55:26.250 --> 01:55:28.680
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am somewhat of a god complex.</v>

2206
01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:35.240
<v Speaker 4>I feel like a god complex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there you have it.</v>

2207
01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:39.550
<v Speaker 4>Twitch and apparently there was like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>video.</v>

2208
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:42.430
<v Speaker 14>No,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's just like kind of weird text.</v>

2209
01:55:44.770 --> 01:55:48.500
<v Speaker 4>Not Better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like no bigger than just long and no</v>

2210
01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:49.533
<v Speaker 4>good way to say this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think of myself as like above the </v>

2211
01:55:51.211 --> 01:55:52.044
<v Speaker 4>average person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't feel like many people could </v>

2212
01:55:53.461 --> 01:55:57.540
<v Speaker 4>relate to me as like bad as that sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what a fucking idiot.</v>

2213
01:56:00.450 --> 01:56:01.620
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you have it.</v>

2214
01:56:04.890 --> 01:56:06.450
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2215
01:56:06.451 --> 01:56:08.170
<v Speaker 4>this store is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

2216
01:56:08.210 --> 01:56:10.350
<v Speaker 4>you're going to love this specifically </v>
<v Speaker 4>you Ila,</v>

2217
01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:12.813
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>porn watching employee infected </v>

2218
01:56:16.621 --> 01:56:17.454
<v Speaker 4>government network with Russian malware </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the fucking title you've ever seen </v>

2219
01:56:23.161 --> 01:56:25.560
<v Speaker 4>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen to this shit.</v>

2220
01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:30.330
<v Speaker 4>Government auditors traced a malware </v>
<v Speaker 4>infection back to a single porn watching</v>

2221
01:56:30.331 --> 01:56:31.164
<v Speaker 4>employ within the US geographical survey</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the interior department watchdog </v>

2222
01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:36.293
<v Speaker 4>recommended the US Geographical Survey </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ratchet Up Internet security protocols </v>

2223
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:41.430
<v Speaker 4>after discovering its network had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>infected with malware.</v>

2224
01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:42.503
<v Speaker 4>So I guess there's like a government </v>
<v Speaker 4>agency network that kind of connects </v>

2225
01:56:46.321 --> 01:56:49.460
<v Speaker 4>everything and they have really strict </v>
<v Speaker 4>rules about what,</v>

2226
01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:53.760
<v Speaker 4>how you can use the internet because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where so slick that Russia,</v>

2227
01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:59.120
<v Speaker 4>they're like banking on the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>some employees meeting off at work do.</v>

2228
01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:04.050
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever like put on porn at work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2229
01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:07.230
<v Speaker 4>why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll say this,</v>

2230
01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:16.920
<v Speaker 4>I'll say that you have a lot of downtime</v>
<v Speaker 4>at work.</v>

2231
01:57:17.610 --> 01:57:19.910
<v Speaker 4>You can have a lot of downtime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2232
01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:25.220
<v Speaker 4>It says that he reportedly used the </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer to visit 9,000</v>

2233
01:57:26.731 --> 01:57:30.570
<v Speaker 4>adult video sites that sell fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot.</v>

2234
01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:32.970
<v Speaker 4>Like if I'm browsing Reddit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2235
01:57:32.971 --> 01:57:36.390
<v Speaker 4>at work and my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my desk is facing the wall.</v>

2236
01:57:37.770 --> 01:57:38.521
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2237
01:57:38.521 --> 01:57:41.080
<v Speaker 4>you see some titties on the home page </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you probably,</v>

2238
01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:41.953
<v Speaker 4>you probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take a look but you don't do when </v>

2239
01:57:44.250 --> 01:57:46.560
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not downloading porn videos.</v>

2240
01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:53.300
<v Speaker 4>Not like augmenting my catalog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's like on fucking pornhub,</v>

2241
01:57:54.481 --> 01:57:58.930
<v Speaker 4>like downloading shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said 9,000</v>

2242
01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:01.580
<v Speaker 4>sites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you want that?</v>

2243
01:58:01.650 --> 01:58:04.620
<v Speaker 4>That's his job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watching porn is his job.</v>

2244
01:58:04.621 --> 01:58:06.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he does with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>geographical services.</v>

2245
01:58:07.730 --> 01:58:10.150
<v Speaker 4>That's not just popping over to pornhub.</v>

2246
01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:11.953
<v Speaker 4>You either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you asking if I got my dick out and </v>

2247
01:58:14.461 --> 01:58:15.181
<v Speaker 4>masturbate?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2248
01:58:15.181 --> 01:58:17.220
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2249
01:58:17.221 --> 01:58:21.210
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm asking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I did exactly.</v>

2250
01:58:21.211 --> 01:58:25.740
<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't like watching porn at</v>
<v Speaker 4>work because it's like I'm not,</v>

2251
01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:28.470
<v Speaker 4>some people watch porn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's like a cooking show.</v>

2252
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:33.510
<v Speaker 4>So for me it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I put it on and let's be frank,</v>

2253
01:58:34.081 --> 01:58:37.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm not cleaning the pipes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting the poison out as they say.</v>

2254
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:39.560
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2255
01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:41.433
<v Speaker 4>it's like that's kind of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand going to a strip </v>

2256
01:58:43.241 --> 01:58:44.080
<v Speaker 4>club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2257
01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:44.973
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never been to a strip club and I </v>

2258
01:58:45.941 --> 01:58:47.320
<v Speaker 4>really have no interest because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2259
01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:50.020
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2260
01:58:50.021 --> 01:58:51.920
<v Speaker 4>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go home and beat off.</v>

2261
01:58:51.921 --> 01:58:53.040
<v Speaker 4>That's the same thing I was going to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

2262
01:58:53.670 --> 01:58:56.320
<v Speaker 4>saved the money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch some porn,</v>

2263
01:58:57.310 --> 01:59:00.280
<v Speaker 4>and then let some Russian malware.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you got to,</v>

2264
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:02.560
<v Speaker 4>you got to admire the ingenuity of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russian,</v>

2265
01:59:02.561 --> 01:59:07.510
<v Speaker 4>like cyber warriors putting like putting</v>
<v Speaker 4>ads on porn sites with malware.</v>

2266
01:59:07.570 --> 01:59:09.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

2267
01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:14.160
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2268
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:16.511

<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

2269
01:59:16.511 --> 01:59:19.030
<v Speaker 4>there's like digital detectives that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they go.</v>

2270
01:59:19.031 --> 01:59:19.864
<v Speaker 4>Our digital forensic examination </v>
<v Speaker 4>revealed that the employee had an </v>

2271
01:59:22.781 --> 01:59:26.110
<v Speaker 4>extensive history of visiting adult </v>
<v Speaker 4>pornography websites.</v>

2272
01:59:26.710 --> 01:59:30.760
<v Speaker 4>The hosted malware,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a rope.</v>

2273
01:59:31.570 --> 01:59:34.540
<v Speaker 4>The malware was downloaded to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>employees government laptop,</v>

2274
01:59:34.570 --> 01:59:39.460
<v Speaker 4>which then exploited the USG s network.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that awesome?</v>

2275
01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:41.493
<v Speaker 4>This is the best episode of CSI ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The employee no longer works at the </v>

2276
01:59:46.091 --> 01:59:50.560
<v Speaker 4>agency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We imagine trying to get his next job.</v>

2277
01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:54.700
<v Speaker 4>He had a good run having to say why it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was firing his next job.</v>

2278
01:59:54.701 --> 01:59:57.130
<v Speaker 4>He can host a porn site.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got 9,000</v>

2279
01:59:57.131 --> 01:59:59.340
<v Speaker 4>videos.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So tell me what part do you like over </v>

2282
02:00:07.601 --> 02:00:08.434
<v Speaker 4>the last 15 years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Similar scandals have enveloped the </v>

2283
02:00:10.481 --> 02:00:11.314
<v Speaker 4>environmental protection agency,</v>
<v Speaker 4>securities and exchange commissions and </v>

2284
02:00:14.441 --> 02:00:15.274
<v Speaker 4>irs.</v>

2285
02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:16.413
<v Speaker 4>Last year a DC area news network </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncovered egregious on the job </v>

2286
02:00:19.751 --> 02:00:24.751
<v Speaker 4>pornography viewing at a dozen federal </v>
<v Speaker 4>agencies and national security officials</v>

2287
02:00:25.241 --> 02:00:28.510
<v Speaker 4>have reportedly found an unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of child pornography.</v>

2288
02:00:28.930 --> 02:00:30.430
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That threw me off.</v>

2289
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:33.010
<v Speaker 4>I didn't expect that on government </v>
<v Speaker 4>devices.</v>

2290
02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:36.280
<v Speaker 4>Fucking hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were the people watching child porn</v>

2291
02:00:36.281 --> 02:00:39.040
<v Speaker 4>and downloading it and they work at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

2292
02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:40.233
<v Speaker 4>Fuck this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This problem is so prevalent that a rep </v>

2293
02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:46.713
<v Speaker 4>Mark Meadows has introduced legislation </v>
<v Speaker 4>banning pornography at federal agencies </v>

2294
02:00:50.621 --> 02:00:54.040
<v Speaker 4>three different times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you need a,</v>

2295
02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:57.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the legislation going to do this?</v>

2296
02:00:57.880 --> 02:00:58.713
<v Speaker 4>God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys stop watching porn on your </v>

2297
02:01:00.551 --> 02:01:05.551
<v Speaker 4>government computers putting national </v>
<v Speaker 4>security at risk.</v>

2298

<v Speaker 2>It's very nice message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want it to read.</v>

2388
02:05:45.831 --> 02:05:50.190
<v Speaker 2>It comes from heart bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Ethan,</v>

2389
02:05:50.191 --> 02:05:53.320
<v Speaker 2>in Isla and podcast crew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My name is Hart bridges.</v>

2390
02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:58.330
<v Speaker 2>A month ago my mom was unexpectedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed with stage four lymphoma.</v>

2391
02:05:58.790 --> 02:06:01.400
<v Speaker 2>She recently passed her second treatment</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Chemo.</v>

2392
02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:03.920
<v Speaker 2>She's doing pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but morale is low.</v>

2393
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:05.083
<v Speaker 2>She was such an active person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always working out and doing different </v>

2394
02:06:08.301 --> 02:06:09.134
<v Speaker 2>projects around the house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now she feels weak and unable to </v>

2395
02:06:11.781 --> 02:06:12.614
<v Speaker 2>accomplish anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We started listening to the podcast </v>

2396
02:06:14.901 --> 02:06:15.734
<v Speaker 2>together about five months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We listed in the car sometimes around </v>

2397
02:06:18.411 --> 02:06:22.400
<v Speaker 2>the house and now at the hospital during</v>
<v Speaker 2>her six hour plus treatments.</v>

2398
02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:23.653
<v Speaker 2>We both find y'all absolutely hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her birthday's coming up in November on </v>

2399
02:06:29.421 --> 02:06:30.254
<v Speaker 2>the seventh and I was wondering if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could get you to sign a shirt for a pay </v>

2400
02:06:36.111 --> 02:06:37.100
<v Speaker 2>for the shirt and shipping.</v>

2401
02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:37.933
<v Speaker 2>If even you could just sign it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would love it so much and I know </v>

2402
02:06:40.381 --> 02:06:43.190
<v Speaker 2>it'd make her smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just pick a great shirt.</v>

2403
02:06:43.250 --> 02:06:47.750
<v Speaker 2>She wears a large love Ya bark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bridgett Hart bridges.</v>

2404
02:06:47.751 --> 02:06:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Well obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
