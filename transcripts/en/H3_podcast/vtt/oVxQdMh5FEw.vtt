00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.900

<v Speaker 3>but I'm an old man.</v>

15
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.093
<v Speaker 3>I think the best way to find the full </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie post apocalypto is to go to </v>

19
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 2>So grab some tickets and catch the d </v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

20
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.923
<v Speaker 3>The best one to see of all the shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>were playing is a December 30th in Las </v>

21
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're doing something very special,</v>

22
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say what we're doing there,</v>

23
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 3>but that's the one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can,</v>

24
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.933
<v Speaker 3>you should get on a plane and fly to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>tenacious d in Las Vegas on a lot of </v>

25
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 3>people are gravitating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Towards our New Year's eve show in Las </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas.</v>

27
00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:34.321
<v Speaker 2>And that's the natural show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the good show has nothing to do with</v>

28
00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 2>the tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tickets left.</v>

29
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a little well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also variety for your consideration.</v>

30
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Tenacious d did you guys see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

31
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who put that in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

32
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly I watched em</v>

33
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 2>loved so much this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

34
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a movie or Shell?</v>

35
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Because it's six parts and then you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got it all together in one slot.</v>

36
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 2>So do you think of it as a movie or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>show or a show?</v>

37
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.773
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have found that the best delivery </v>

38
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:15.204
<v Speaker 2>system is actually on a big screen in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie theater and just see it at all at </v>

39
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:23.470
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharing it with the fellow fans.</v>

40
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

41
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 3>it's more of a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we didn't know we,</v>

42
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 3>I think we accidentally made a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're making little episodes.</v>

43
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 3>You're making little five to 10 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>episodes.</v>

44
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 3>And then when we got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we got to the sixth episode,</v>

45
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:37.914
<v Speaker 3>the finale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we realized if we took away the intro </v>

46
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:44.280
<v Speaker 3>outro and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ran them as one movie,</v>

47
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 3>it actually played the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

48
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 3>we think of it in a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

49
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 3>It's an album,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a TV show.</v>

50
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.360
<v Speaker 3>It's a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be a broadway play,</v>

51
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.203
<v Speaker 3>could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

52
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the live show is very a rock opera </v>

53
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 3>ask presentation of</v>

54
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.450
<v Speaker 5>the material as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

55
00:03:02.451 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 5>that sounds Super Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.743
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I can maybe one up and you know </v>

57
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 5>Bruce springsteen's on Broadway right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now doing his show.</v>

58
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he has any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any lights and magic.</v>

59
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 5>He's an old singer songwriter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I thought,</v>

60
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 5>why don't we just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

61
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're kidding,</v>

62
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:20.224
<v Speaker 5>but I would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would watch the heck out of a post </v>

63
00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 5>apocalypto Broadway show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

64
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason why we did,</v>

65
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:26.614
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason why we did post </v>

66
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:29.524
<v Speaker 5>apocalypto as we were jealous of a book </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Mormon are our arch enemies in south </v>

67
00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:36.054
<v Speaker 5>park.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did this incredibly funny musical </v>

68
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 5>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you get a chance to see it,</v>

69
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 5>it's probably playing near your town </v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

70
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 5>A Super Raunchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

71
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 5>politically incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a broadway musical.</v>

72
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.641
<v Speaker 5>And we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

73
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we want to party in that sphere.</v>

74
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 5>Genre rock the dramas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

75
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.230
<v Speaker 5>there's isn't really a rock opera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

76
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 5>you're true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually classical classic.</v>

77
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 5>It was a broadway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was so hard to see.</v>

78
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 5>And I was living in Israel at the time </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was so much hubbub about it.</v>

79
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:12.304
<v Speaker 5>I really wanted to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the only thing I was able to find </v>

80
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:19.651
<v Speaker 5>was a gentlemen recording it on his cell</v>
<v Speaker 5>phone the best way,</v>

81
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 5>one of the back isles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I have to say,</v>

82
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think it was good.</v>

83
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should still like,</v>

84
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.993
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should catch it.</v>

85
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.833
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but so you guys did everything on this </v>

86
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 5>and it's a very unique style you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a cartoon,</v>

87
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 5>but it's what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like one frame every 10 seconds.</v>

88
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 5>So you guys kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I find charming.</v>

89
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:46.550
<v Speaker 5>It's not like I wouldn't consider it </v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's,</v>

90
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 5>it's just a style.</v>

91
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's very charming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was this some like a style that you guys</v>

92
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 5>chose four or was it kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>expedient thing?</v>

93
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.183
<v Speaker 5>Well at first we were thinking this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're just going to do a real rough </v>

94
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 5>version of what our fully animated show </v>
<v Speaker 5>would be.</v>

95
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.191
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

96
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:08.030
<v Speaker 5>we were making our rick and morty </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically and uh,</v>

97
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 5>nobody wanted it on any other network.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then we were like,</v>

98
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to just do it our way.</v>

99
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

100
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.940
<v Speaker 5>just the cheapest way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

101
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.403
<v Speaker 5>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it ended up being in a way funnier than </v>

102
00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:27.910
<v Speaker 5>it is here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is charming.</v>

103
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

104
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 5>there wasn't any point where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

105
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:33.440
<v Speaker 5>I wish I had more frames.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

106
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.110
<v Speaker 5>Cause you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You totally got it.</v>

107
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 5>And I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I totally understand.</v>

108
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 5>As I watched that robot vagina suck and </v>
<v Speaker 5>swirl on that cough,</v>

109
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.483
<v Speaker 5>I Scott boiler alert in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes it less than a graphic while </v>

110
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 5>it's just frame.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

111
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

112
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 5>I was stopped up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never,</v>

113
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.080
<v Speaker 5>I never wanted to fuck a robot before I </v>
<v Speaker 5>watched your guys's go.</v>

114
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 5>We're ahead of the curve for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

115
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 5>when we're done with this youtube</v>

118
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 3>you have to get a rating from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ratings board,</v>

119
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 3>the MPA ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're like,</v>

120
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:10.310
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to the MPA,</v>

121
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:11.144
<v Speaker 3>we paid them the thousand bucks or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it costs to get the thing and </v>

122
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:19.001
<v Speaker 3>then they said this is nc 17 and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot be shown anywhere ever drawing of</v>

123
00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:22.314
<v Speaker 3>a penis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like a badly drawn drawing of </v>

124
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:26.290
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like real photo realistic.</v>

125
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.823
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like the sweetest </v>

126
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 3>pornography I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's got a,</v>

127
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:37.541
<v Speaker 3>it's got a real message of love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not coming from a place of a</v>

128
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.830
<v Speaker 2>exploitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely no expectation at not at all.</v>

129
00:06:41.831 --> 00:06:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is enjoying themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

130
00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:44.614
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a scene of will the robot does </v>

131
00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:48.880
<v Speaker 2>put a finger on the but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also,</v>

132
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:49.714
<v Speaker 2>spoiler alert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the balls and guys the penis into </v>

133
00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:53.560
<v Speaker 2>the vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gosh.</v>

134
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.850
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

135
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Speaker 2>I was free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

136
00:06:55.961 --> 00:06:56.794
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

137
00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.760
<v Speaker 3>Well in a way it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very uh,</v>

138
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 3>educational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

139
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.920
<v Speaker 3>It saves you a conversation about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>birds and the bees.</v>

140
00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 3>If you want to just show parents,</v>

141
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.510
<v Speaker 2>well you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys gave a warning beforehand,</v>

142
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.490
<v Speaker 2>but through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed the only,</v>

143
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.070
<v Speaker 2>so on Youtube you've got these six </v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes in the movie.</v>

144
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.760
<v Speaker 2>The only one that is an age restricted </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the first episode.</v>

145
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.370
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if you guys know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how youtube works,</v>

146
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:25.360
<v Speaker 2>but when a video gets age restricted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they share it less.</v>

147
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

148
00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:27.880
<v Speaker 2>we know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All too.</v>

149
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:28.714
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's bots flying around </v>

150
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.400
<v Speaker 2>looking for shapes of penis chariot.</v>

151
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.373
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the craziest that they don't </v>

152
00:07:35.161 --> 00:07:35.994
<v Speaker 3>share it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

153
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.163
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible to find the full movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you type in tenacious d post </v>

154
00:07:41.371 --> 00:07:44.280
<v Speaker 3>apocalypto full movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it still doesn't come up.</v>

155
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.590
<v Speaker 3>And if you have not signed Daniel can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch it.</v>

156
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.813
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just want people to be able to </v>

157
00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:52.110
<v Speaker 3>find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm only telling people to go</v>

158
00:07:52.111 --> 00:07:53.880
<v Speaker 3>to [inaudible] dot com is the best way.</v>

159
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:54.940
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

160
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.700
<v Speaker 2>if you go to the channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see it all there.</v>

161
00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.410
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube does it.</v>

162
00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:00.560
<v Speaker 2>They bury stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

163
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.403
<v Speaker 2>they'll just bury it because they're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of it harming their platform and </v>

164
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.140
<v Speaker 2>scaring advertisers away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just a little,</v>

165
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.950
<v Speaker 2>what about this for promotion though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The show youtube did watch.</v>

166
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.413
<v Speaker 2>That's excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't that always have to watch it </v>

167
00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:17.141
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

168
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:17.974
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

169
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.903
<v Speaker 2>you're going to wash this robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swirl this vagina around a cock and </v>

170
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:21.844
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

171
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

172
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future is already are robots.</v>

173
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.040
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about robot and draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>falls now.</v>

174
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I heard of a sex doll bronco,</v>

175
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:34.743
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know that there's mechanics </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the vagina because we're always just </v>

176
00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:40.300
<v Speaker 2>a sloppy plastic is just around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>

177
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.110
<v Speaker 2>That sounded really appealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now would you guys fuck a robot that had</v>

178
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:45.100
<v Speaker 2>like a super badge?</v>

179
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I must admit in my youth,</v>

180
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.000
<v Speaker 3>I think there might've been a doll </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

181
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Tell me about that more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

182
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.183
<v Speaker 3>I might've continued in the early days </v>
<v Speaker 3>of experimentation when you want to </v>

183
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:06.564
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the adults can be a great </v>

184
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 3>educational tool.</v>

185
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.790
<v Speaker 2>I fully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

186
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.230
<v Speaker 2>no judgment on my side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

187
00:09:15.231 --> 00:09:16.064
<v Speaker 2>I put at that age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put your Dick in just about </v>

188
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:18.974
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

189
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

190
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.290
<v Speaker 2>tell me about what did the doll look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>

191
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.260
<v Speaker 3>Kind of like a,</v>

192
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.560
<v Speaker 2>where do you get those because you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be of age or do you get those at</v>

193
00:09:32.561 --> 00:09:33.520
<v Speaker 2>a six shot?</v>

194
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.713
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there might've been some shoplifting </v>

195
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.430
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I should go into all the detail.</v>

196
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.563
<v Speaker 3>There might've been a crazy night out </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a ucla that's in the theater </v>

197
00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:50.170
<v Speaker 3>department.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

198
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might've been like 19 years old.</v>

199
00:09:53.691 --> 00:09:54.524
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

200
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.410
<v Speaker 3>that's a little old for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for uh,</v>

201
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 3>needing a doll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

202
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.003
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no age limit on when you need a </v>

203
00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>

204
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently you are not,</v>

205
00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:05.364
<v Speaker 2>you can't even buy it until you're 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the people that need it the most </v>

206
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 2>don't have access to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

207
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

208
00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:13.490
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe the target audience is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is uh,</v>

209
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 3>men in their forties for the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

210
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.770
<v Speaker 2>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

211
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Thank God I'm too old for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I just,</v>

212
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 2>depending on a large pillow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with that vivid imagination,</v>

213
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

214
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I want to expand on this further and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>

215
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking it too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you fuck a robot sex doll,</v>

216
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:34.824
<v Speaker 2>is it cheating?</v>

217
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're married and you have,</v>

218
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.251
<v Speaker 2>and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

219
00:10:39.251 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I want this vagina can swirl and soc and</v>
<v Speaker 2>do all of them do everything.</v>

220
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's just a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that cheating?</v>

221
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it depends on the,</v>

222
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.550
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the secrecy of the act.</v>

223
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.423
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

224
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

225
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're going on the road,</v>

226
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do a job and your wife would actually</v>

227
00:11:00.311 --> 00:11:04.660
<v Speaker 3>give you a doll or like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little flashlights,</v>

228
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.580
<v Speaker 3>something that would fit in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't a fleshlight basically,</v>

229
00:11:07.581 --> 00:11:08.414
<v Speaker 3>or a sex robot.</v>

230
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a robot,</v>

231
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 2>but it is a sex flush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

232
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.490
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me show you a flash.</v>

233
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.180
<v Speaker 2>A flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I kill the question?</v>

234
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

235
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot there.</v>

236
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Well here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this point is not very graphic.</v>

237
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 2>So let me show you this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ sake.</v>

238
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:36.090
<v Speaker 2>It's on Amazon here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasting my time with my hand.</v>

239
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:37.490
<v Speaker 2>This all these years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

240
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.060
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's start here.</v>

241
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Ila is a fleshlight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

242
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.580
<v Speaker 2>infidelity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

243
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a fleshlight usually shaped more</v>

244
00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:48.780
<v Speaker 2>like a vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to think you can see it</v>

245
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:49.670
<v Speaker 2>on the screen there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

246
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.380
<v Speaker 2>But it's a basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love that they make it look like a</v>

247
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 2>flat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a flashlight</v>

248
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.980
<v Speaker 5>of all things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like put your Dick in this flashlight.</v>

249
00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.050
<v Speaker 5>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any kind of sphere or any kind of,</v>

250
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 5>does it light up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's no light.</v>

251
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.560
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh wow.</v>

252
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.130
<v Speaker 5>Does this only when you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But here we have a video.</v>

253
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 5>Please don't be a penis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

254
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:11.764
<v Speaker 5>We'd better know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like the light could create </v>

255
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:19.270
<v Speaker 5>some warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

256
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.473
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So can I use a fleshlight Isla without </v>

257
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 5>consulting with you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

258
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 5>I guess it would just be a little weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you did.</v>

259
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if it doesn't have a face,</v>

260
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 5>it's not cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the parameter just have to</v>

261
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:36.964
<v Speaker 5>be decided on together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what's the fleshlight and </v>

262
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 5>masturbating and sorry doing include you</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys on this conversation.</v>

263
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.200
<v Speaker 5>It's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No masturbation.</v>

264
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.510
<v Speaker 5>Well maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

265
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.360
<v Speaker 5>Is Masturbation shooting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

266
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

267
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you're like,</v>

268
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.810
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get outta here and go masturbate.</v>

269
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to see that.</v>

270
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.420
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I was reading though you,</v>

271
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 5>it's important that you should </v>
<v Speaker 5>masturbate together though.</v>

272
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:04.960
<v Speaker 5>You should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not all the time.</v>

273
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.240
<v Speaker 5>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but comfortable enough with that contact</v>

274
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.000
<v Speaker 5>laser.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need to try that cow.</v>

275
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:20.030
<v Speaker 5>I assume you guys had done that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a Howard Stern interview.</v>

276
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:24.510
<v Speaker 5>I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

277
00:13:24.511 --> 00:13:26.920
<v Speaker 5>And Ringo claimed he wasn't there for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that session,</v>

278
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.770
<v Speaker 5>the band,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yet he had the perfect alibi.</v>

279
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:32.583
<v Speaker 5>He was there finally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find it funny how people made such a </v>

280
00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:37.060
<v Speaker 5>big scoop out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

281
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 5>it's funny besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's funny,</v>

282
00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:39.664
<v Speaker 5>but like people started trying to draw </v>
<v Speaker 5>the conclusion that they were like </v>

283
00:13:42.581 --> 00:13:44.380
<v Speaker 5>lovers and all this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

284
00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:46.270
<v Speaker 5>and it's just a couple of dudes jerking </v>
<v Speaker 5>off in the dark.</v>

285
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.223
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

286
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.633
<v Speaker 5>They're young.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all up the early Beatles and </v>

287
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:52.810
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

288
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.423
<v Speaker 5>maybe that's why they kicked out the </v>
<v Speaker 5>drummer if they didn't like the way he </v>

289
00:13:57.281 --> 00:14:02.281
<v Speaker 5>masturbated with them was a snare and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the ladies though he was an American</v>

290
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.630
<v Speaker 5>and apparently he was very good looking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is he still available for drumming?</v>

291
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.203
<v Speaker 5>Curious.</v>

292
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.040
<v Speaker 5>You've got Sasha?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

294
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.080

<v Speaker 5>the art,</v>

296
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.670

<v Speaker 5>the writing.</v>

297

<v Speaker 5>wars and who was the art director </v>

300
00:14:31.301 --> 00:14:36.301
<v Speaker 5>because there is a very distinct art </v>
<v Speaker 5>style throughout art direction.</v>

301
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.870
<v Speaker 5>All Art Times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

302
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:39.783
<v Speaker 5>I actually tried to draw a cell just to </v>
<v Speaker 5>show Jack what it would be like if he </v>

303
00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:46.060
<v Speaker 5>wasn't drawing it and it was really bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>burns.</v>

304
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.240

<v Speaker 5>I did draw it,</v>

305
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.730
<v Speaker 5>but we got uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>how probably too we got a colorist is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing Michael Molina to do all the </v>

307
00:14:57.471 --> 00:15:01.070
<v Speaker 5>color with his computer and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

308
00:15:01.071 --> 00:15:01.904
<v Speaker 5>we were going to hand over the reigns to</v>
<v Speaker 5>some other animator and artists at some </v>

309
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:07.364
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that was back when we had dreams of </v>

310
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.650
<v Speaker 5>having a Netflix or hbo series and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>we were like,</v>

311

<v Speaker 5>it's better this way.</v>

312
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.300
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were laughing until late version,</v>

313
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.270
<v Speaker 5>but butthead isn't well drawn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's great.</v>

<v Speaker 5>butthead a style.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean I find that a pure insanity.</v>

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.380
<v Speaker 5>Well I would love spicy somebody's neck.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot.</v>

320
00:15:42.331 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 5>I know none of the major players,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but where are you guys uncompromising on</v>

321
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:49.910
<v Speaker 5>the penis and set like very graphic sex </v>
<v Speaker 5>shots.</v>

322
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.240
<v Speaker 5>We presented what we wanted to put on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the air.</v>

323
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.051
<v Speaker 5>We weren't saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

324
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 5>we want to do something like this.</v>

329
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:09.320
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a way we were kind of glad about that</v>

330
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:10.160
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

331
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 5>it gave us an opportunity to really go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seemed kind of liberating.</v>

424
00:20:41.561 --> 00:20:42.394
<v Speaker 5>of us.</v>

<v Speaker 5>your father was born a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my father was,</v>

426
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.910
<v Speaker 5>my father was born Protestant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

427
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 5>My mother was born a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which makes me full Jew according to the</v>

428
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:55.621
<v Speaker 5>Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm not out.</v>

430
00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:57.483
<v Speaker 5>I'm not questioning your doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the idea is we know where you came </v>

431
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.970
<v Speaker 5>from because we have witnesses were not </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive if your dad was a Jew or not.</v>

432
00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:08.284
<v Speaker 5>So true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never thought of it that you came out </v>

00:21:10.551 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 5>of that vagina.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We don't have DNA.</v>

435
00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.080
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are.</v>

436
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.773

<v Speaker 5>they start break dancing and shit in </v>

437
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:21.304
<v Speaker 5>front of the baby.</v>

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.400
<v Speaker 5>That I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it so much.</v>

439
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.700
<v Speaker 5>But your story is unusual because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>usually,</v>

440
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.690
<v Speaker 5>I find that it's the male or the female </v>
<v Speaker 5>that a convert to Judaism.</v>

441
00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:39.570
<v Speaker 5>But your dad converted to Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

442
00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:40.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find that fascinating.</v>

443
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.990

444
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:46.690
<v Speaker 5>but also because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was into Judaism.</v>

445
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.690
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He drunk.</v>

447
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.170

<v Speaker 2>that luxury is a process.</v>

599
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not about specs and it's not about </v>
<v Speaker 2>price.</v>

600
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not a marketing term to be thrown </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

601
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.570
<v Speaker 2>It's about attention to detail as step </v>
<v Speaker 2>by step process to craft.</v>

602
00:29:20.571 --> 00:29:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Every product is this process that </v>
<v Speaker 2>separates us from the competition,</v>

<v Speaker 2>them from the competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not associated with them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and mass produce mentalistic watches </v>

00:29:35.841 --> 00:29:38.720
<v Speaker 2>that have flooded the market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to offer a watch that was able</v>

612
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:55.720
<v Speaker 2>times the price by selling directly to </v>

716
00:35:10.321 --> 00:35:12.740
<v Speaker 2>reason I did it was because I went to </v>

<v Speaker 2>Well they changed that.</v>

720
00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.930
<v Speaker 2>They changed that.</v>

721
00:35:21.931 --> 00:35:24.480
<v Speaker 2>no pass.</v>

722
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.433
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they are very not only liberal in </v>

723
00:35:27.001 --> 00:35:30.900
<v Speaker 2>spirit but also in their forgiveness of </v>

<v Speaker 7>looks treachery.</v>

757
00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.123
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We didn't like the front of the stage </v>

758
00:37:37.101 --> 00:37:42.101
<v Speaker 7>looking like it has jagged wouldn't fell</v>
<v Speaker 7>in between the wooden teeth.</v>

759
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.440
<v Speaker 7>Have you guys ever had any stage</v>

760
00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.273
<v Speaker 5>malfunctions or any issues on stage was </v>
<v Speaker 5>we were recently watching a collection </v>

761
00:37:48.461 --> 00:37:52.570
<v Speaker 5>of artists falling off stage and there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of help there by the look of it.</v>

762
00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:57.760
<v Speaker 5>Well occasionally a fan will run up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>and try to Hug Jack.</v>

763
00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:59.350
<v Speaker 5>I think that's happened a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 5>times.</v>

764
00:37:59.351 --> 00:38:01.650
<v Speaker 5>Don't you remember the one though where </v>
<v Speaker 5>I did have one?</v>

765
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:05.350
<v Speaker 5>You did and I think it was when we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>out on tour with the beastie boys.</v>

766
00:38:05.351 --> 00:38:07.900
<v Speaker 5>We were doing like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were rocking the vote.</v>

767
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:08.933
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were rocking the vote and we were </v>

768
00:38:10.091 --> 00:38:10.924
<v Speaker 5>just sorta coming along time around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were opening up for the beast is an </v>

769
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.633
<v Speaker 5>ena and I was like stomping across the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stage and then I just like stopped in </v>

770
00:38:19.871 --> 00:38:23.230
<v Speaker 5>between too big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can also walk on top of the big</v>

771
00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:25.590
<v Speaker 5>speakers that are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

772
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.433
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I like stopped in between speakers </v>

773
00:38:27.701 --> 00:38:29.380
<v Speaker 5>and I went down all the way to my hip.</v>

774
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.150
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

775
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.850
<v Speaker 5>the adrenaline bounced me right back up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I just,</v>

776
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:37.090
<v Speaker 5>I kept on rock and I'm pretending as </v>
<v Speaker 5>though nothing happened.</v>

777
00:38:37.091 --> 00:38:37.924
<v Speaker 5>And I think that might've prevented it </v>
<v Speaker 5>from going viral was that I recovered </v>

778
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:42.124
<v Speaker 5>too quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was pretty intense and I came </v>

779
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 5>very close to breaking my hip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the great,</v>

780
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.573
<v Speaker 5>you remember cones and one of the great </v>
<v Speaker 5>falls we had during a show was our </v>

781
00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:54.520
<v Speaker 5>guitar player and he was shredding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was shredding the Electric Guitar.</v>

782
00:38:54.521 --> 00:38:59.521
<v Speaker 5>So look to the heavens melting phases </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's walking back and many trips all</v>

783
00:38:59.641 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 5>over again is just a direct kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had a,</v>

784
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 5>he had to get right back up though and </v>
<v Speaker 5>continue rocking.</v>

785
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:07.210
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do we have video videotape of that?</v>

786
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:08.223
<v Speaker 5>We should might be on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but luckily there's been no serious </v>

787
00:39:11.591 --> 00:39:14.170
<v Speaker 5>injuries on a tenacious detour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>

<v Speaker 5>he came right back.</v>

791
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:25.480

<v Speaker 5>but now the show must go on and we had a</v>

<v Speaker 4>he goes all the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's never quite as serious when you </v>

816
00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:28.020
<v Speaker 4>weigh 112 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dot.</v>

817
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.950
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

818
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.980
<v Speaker 4>Nothing really hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the normal stage.</v>

819
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:34.043
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

820
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.383
<v Speaker 5>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That last step was a doozy that had to </v>

821
00:40:39.631 --> 00:40:40.464
<v Speaker 5>be like for an effect or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well these dancers popping up through </v>

822
00:40:45.511 --> 00:40:47.540
<v Speaker 5>the hole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's the best of clothes.</v>

823
00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:49.670
<v Speaker 5>That's how you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to cloquet.</v>

824
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to close the hole.</v>

825
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:52.220
<v Speaker 5>How often?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he knows the clothes,</v>

826
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.220
<v Speaker 5>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody knows.</v>

827
00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.680
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something I heard about you that</v>

828
00:40:56.681 --> 00:40:57.840
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I found was interesting.</v>

829
00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.820
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you said,</v>

830
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.070
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we both had this experience.</v>

831
00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.173
<v Speaker 5>We turned 13,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we said smell your later to the </v>

832
00:41:04.831 --> 00:41:05.790
<v Speaker 5>Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

833
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.713
<v Speaker 5>But since you've had kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard that you've returned to </v>

834
00:41:09.421 --> 00:41:10.620
<v Speaker 5>synagogue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

835
00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:11.483
<v Speaker 5>I did feel like it was important for </v>
<v Speaker 5>them to feel part of a community and I </v>

836
00:41:15.301 --> 00:41:18.320
<v Speaker 5>wanted them to have that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

837
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:19.163
<v Speaker 5>we did have them enrolled in a school </v>
<v Speaker 5>that had Hebrew studies as part of the </v>

838
00:41:23.341 --> 00:41:27.770
<v Speaker 5>curriculum so it wouldn't feel like they</v>
<v Speaker 5>had to go to extra school afterschool.</v>

839
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.940
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

840
00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.980
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't a good fit for the boy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were there for a few years.</v>

841
00:41:31.981 --> 00:41:33.770
<v Speaker 5>This is a good school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

842
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

843
00:41:35.211 --> 00:41:36.044
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dan actually so much stress dude is </v>

844
00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:40.490
<v Speaker 5>figuring out the right school for our </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids.</v>

845
00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:45.590
<v Speaker 5>I've spent so much time and energy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>just like anxiety over this part.</v>

846
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:49.430
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea being a parent could be so</v>
<v Speaker 5>hard.</v>

847
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.930
<v Speaker 5>You thought it was going to become a </v>
<v Speaker 5>public school,</v>

848
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.650
<v Speaker 5>public school just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

849
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:53.750
<v Speaker 5>what's wrong with the public?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

850
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:56.310
<v Speaker 5>what's wrong with public school?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

851
00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:01.640
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't feel like our society puts </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough energy towards public education.</v>

852
00:42:04.341 --> 00:42:05.870
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are tragically,</v>

853
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.913
<v Speaker 5>I feel like even though it's not fair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I have to use the resources </v>

854
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:12.161
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

855
00:42:12.161 --> 00:42:17.120
<v Speaker 5>that we have at our disposal to give our</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids the best possible education.</v>

856
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 5>And that unfortunately does not include </v>
<v Speaker 5>public school ad this time.</v>

857
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.473
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and is it a problem for your kids being </v>

858
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.190
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does it cause issues for them being your</v>

859
00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:30.500
<v Speaker 5>son?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does that ever,</v>

860
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.420
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is a factor too.</v>

861
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:33.261
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

862
00:42:33.261 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

863
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.470
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

864
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.820
<v Speaker 5>when everybody knows who your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your father is,</v>

865
00:42:40.821 --> 00:42:44.180
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of a weird situation for </v>
<v Speaker 5>them to be in.</v>

866
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:49.181
<v Speaker 5>And then to not know if like their </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends or friends because they're,</v>

867
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:51.460
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's complicated for it.</v>

868
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.360
<v Speaker 5>It's hard enough for an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

869
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:54.920
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

00:42:54.921 --> 00:42:56.330
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think my boys are,</v>

871
00:42:56.331 --> 00:43:00.860
<v Speaker 5>are relatively well adjusted and it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually my son Sammy,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you've been on hot.</v>

<v Speaker 5>The best shows.</v>

888
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.360
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe that children are,</v>

889
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.180
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hold on,</v>

890
00:43:44.181 --> 00:43:45.014
<v Speaker 5>back up.</v>

891
00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:47.913
<v Speaker 5>My glasses have a tendency to fog up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a hot and steamy guy by nature and </v>

892
00:43:51.981 --> 00:43:52.814
<v Speaker 5>sometimes it bothers me and I'll just go</v>
<v Speaker 5>up here for a little while and let them </v>

893
00:43:55.581 --> 00:43:58.820
<v Speaker 5>cool off and then I'll bring them back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did it kind of without your hands,</v>

894
00:43:58.821 --> 00:44:00.380
<v Speaker 5>which I thought was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

895
00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:02.150
<v Speaker 5>Well I can bring him down without my </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands.</v>

896
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 5>I can't get them back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get them up there.</v>

897
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.130
<v Speaker 5>That would be something that we then had</v>
<v Speaker 5>really business,</v>

898
00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:08.403
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reason we've been thinking about it </v>

899
00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:12.980
<v Speaker 5>is because I'm pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

900
00:44:12.981 --> 00:44:16.850
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got a little thing happening.</v>

901
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:19.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's exciting.</v>

902
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:22.390
<v Speaker 5>So we know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do we have any idea what's,</v>

903
00:44:22.391 --> 00:44:23.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's coming up?</v>

904
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 5>We think we haven't said that yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't mind saying we will that the</v>

905
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:30.500
<v Speaker 5>person who did the ultrasound,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>

906
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:32.820
<v Speaker 5>if I had to guess do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said,</v>

907
00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 5>do you want my guests?</v>

908
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.283
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

909
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 5>it says I love that move and you do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>so casually.</v>

910
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 5>There wasn't also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is a button on it.</v>

911
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 5>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was like boom,</v>

912
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:45.060
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I'm ready for business.</v>

913
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.970
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt like they were default enough but</v>

914
00:44:47.971 --> 00:44:48.804
<v Speaker 5>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually need like some sauce and a </v>

915
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:52.800
<v Speaker 5>cloth because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're being on.</v>

916
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:56.370
<v Speaker 5>You need to defrost or like a little fan</v>
<v Speaker 5>inside or something.</v>

917
00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:01.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to use the phone crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone rescue our little,</v>

918
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.900
<v Speaker 5>our little troublemaker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

919
00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:05.680
<v Speaker 5>the ultrasound guys?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

920
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.600
<v Speaker 5>The ultrasound take a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>

921
00:45:08.601 --> 00:45:11.340
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a,</v>

922
00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a girl really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that is not what they said.</v>

923
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:15.893
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said they saw little tiny little </v>

924
00:45:17.491 --> 00:45:20.190
<v Speaker 5>baby penis and they thought it was a guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a tip off.</v>

925
00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 5>But I don't know.</v>

926
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:23.490
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause she's like,</v>

927
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 5>well technically the next ultrasound is </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you find out,</v>

928
00:45:26.971 --> 00:45:31.830
<v Speaker 5>but if you want my opinion at one angle </v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw a little penis,</v>

929
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:38.780
<v Speaker 5>which was kind of at another angle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You saw your angle.</v>

930
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.710
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't tell what I was looking now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the ultra stays early.</v>

931
00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:47.544
<v Speaker 5>Ultrasounds are so crazy because there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like so much space and the babies just </v>

932
00:45:52.171 --> 00:45:53.004
<v Speaker 5>like floating around and she's doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing where she's putting on </v>

933
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 5>pushing on the stomach and the baby's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

934
00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:58.643
<v Speaker 5>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an eight ball and an eight ball and has </v>

935
00:46:00.481 --> 00:46:03.450
<v Speaker 5>shaken the eight ball and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>constant around.</v>

936
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:05.460
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

937
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.473
<v Speaker 5>So it's a little boy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We think Theodore Theodore already know </v>

938
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:11.340
<v Speaker 5>you already met him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you know?</v>

939
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:13.080
<v Speaker 5>I feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

940
00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:16.960
<v Speaker 5>I feel that I'm would call him theo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were okay with it.</v>

941
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:17.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

942
00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:18.721
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm fine.</v>

943
00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:20.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm great with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like Sierra.</v>

944
00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:25.290
<v Speaker 5>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we've been wondering what we would do</v>

945
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:28.650
<v Speaker 5>as far as Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole Jewish thing,</v>

946
00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:31.620
<v Speaker 5>because we're not like religious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

947
00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:36.820
<v Speaker 5>But it is a way of growing up during the</v>
<v Speaker 5>holidays and also a barn.</v>

948
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:40.950
<v Speaker 5>They speak Hebrew cause your family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the extra,</v>

949
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.353
<v Speaker 5>the extra schools is just so brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know it's extra because they </v>

950
00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:46.824
<v Speaker 5>don't teach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't teach Hebrew with public </v>

951
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:48.570
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tell you that.</v>

952
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:51.683
<v Speaker 5>No Sir.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt like there was something to be </v>

953
00:46:54.661 --> 00:46:57.280
<v Speaker 5>gained also from the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

954
00:46:57.281 --> 00:46:59.880
<v Speaker 5>the moral fabric that you get with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

955
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.840
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

956
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:05.250
<v Speaker 5>with Judaism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And just in general when you have that,</v>

957
00:47:05.251 --> 00:47:07.080
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that cradle of,</v>

958
00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:09.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a culture that's,</v>

959
00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.820
<v Speaker 5>that's an identity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I very much identify,</v>

960
00:47:11.821 --> 00:47:13.590
<v Speaker 5>I think I come from the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

961
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.290

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

962
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.160

966
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:26.130
<v Speaker 5>bases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I was a,</v>

967
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:28.470
<v Speaker 5>what do you call it when you're a </v>

<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

970
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.630
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she mutilated my genitals.</v>

<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

973
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:45.190
<v Speaker 5>And then at quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

974
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:46.083
<v Speaker 5>and then nobody was interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in church or anything and it was just </v>

975
00:47:48.971 --> 00:47:52.250
<v Speaker 5>evolved into an atheist household </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolved until eight.</v>

976

<v Speaker 5>Do you regret being circumcised?</v>

979
00:47:57.821 --> 00:47:58.654
<v Speaker 5>Because that is a debate that goes on </v>
<v Speaker 5>today is that people are angry at their </v>

980
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:03.840
<v Speaker 5>parents for circumstance.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You don't do that whole like cleaning </v>
<v Speaker 5>business.</v>

984
00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:14.800
<v Speaker 5>It's just such a pilot who it is it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't know.</v>

985
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.330

<v Speaker 5>I'm going to just take a chance on </v>

987
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.660
<v Speaker 5>mutilate it sexually mutilating babies </v>
<v Speaker 5>is not a good idea.</v>

988
00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.580
<v Speaker 5>It's going to call it a leap of faith </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

989
00:48:24.581 --> 00:48:25.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

990
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:29.020

<v Speaker 5>I think my opinion,</v>

996
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.180
<v Speaker 5>I haven't noticed a drop off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have anything to compare it to,</v>

997
00:48:43.181 --> 00:48:47.140
<v Speaker 5>but the quality of orgasms has been all </v>

<v Speaker 5>scope eyes noticed that they had like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>newspaper,</v>

1048
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:29.840
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there an advertisement in a newspaper</v>

1049
00:51:29.841 --> 00:51:33.230
<v Speaker 5>that someone's reading in an episode?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it say?</v>

1050
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.620
<v Speaker 5>It says tenacious done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>D Oh,</v>

1051
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:40.160
<v Speaker 5>walkodile dial done before except </v>
<v Speaker 5>tenacious d.</v>

1052
00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:43.040
<v Speaker 5>And if you read into that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like tenacious is done.</v>

1053
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.290
<v Speaker 5>And we've took that very personally and </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever since then.</v>

1054
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.760
<v Speaker 5>And then we spent the next 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to get to do our festival,</v>

1055
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.050
<v Speaker 5>but we do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we do.</v>

1056
00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:00.020
<v Speaker 5>We do love the conchords.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're uh,</v>

1057
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.430
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Sort of give a vibe like a,</v>

1060
00:52:11.841 --> 00:52:13.610
<v Speaker 5>we're wizards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've arrived.</v>

1061
00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:20.620
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to see the earth searching.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're very furry.</v>

1062
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:24.500
<v Speaker 5>I love many furries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Furries.</v>

1063
00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:29.470
<v Speaker 5>It seems to be sweeping the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you tell me army and here,</v>

1064
00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:30.500
<v Speaker 5>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well this,</v>

1065
00:52:30.501 --> 00:52:32.390
<v Speaker 5>this first is best presented with </v>
<v Speaker 5>photos,</v>

1066
00:52:32.391 --> 00:52:36.590
<v Speaker 5>but a furry think it's either go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>flaming lips,</v>

1067
00:52:36.591 --> 00:52:37.790
<v Speaker 5>concerts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

1068
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:39.713
<v Speaker 5>Anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this might weird you out because </v>

1069
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.120
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are sensitive.</v>

1070
00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.320
<v Speaker 5>So these are people that dress up as </v>
<v Speaker 5>critters.</v>

1071
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.870
<v Speaker 5>It's a sexual thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

1072
00:52:47.871 --> 00:52:48.590
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it part of it?</v>

1073
00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:50.530
<v Speaker 5>As far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a sexual thing.</v>

1074
00:52:50.531 --> 00:52:51.364
<v Speaker 5>So the aiding other furries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they dress up as critters and they just </v>

1075
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:55.550
<v Speaker 5>have orgies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

1076
00:52:55.551 --> 00:52:57.410
<v Speaker 5>As far as I'm aware,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that seems very,</v>

1077
00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.730
<v Speaker 5>very me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

1078
00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.310
<v Speaker 5>I may be representing them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Dan and Ian,</v>

1079
00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:02.144
<v Speaker 5>please fact check me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it does seem to have a sexual </v>

1080
00:53:03.951 --> 00:53:06.920
<v Speaker 5>component.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what's the origin,</v>

1081
00:53:06.921 --> 00:53:09.820
<v Speaker 5>but the faces and I and I got a cute </v>
<v Speaker 5>group there.</v>

1082
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:12.350
<v Speaker 5>You got to say that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that they creep me out.</v>

1083
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:15.680
<v Speaker 5>There is a sexual component from what I </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand.</v>

1084
00:53:15.681 --> 00:53:18.470
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about orgies happening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although,</v>

1085
00:53:18.471 --> 00:53:22.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean we'll explain this Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1086
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.540
<v Speaker 5>I need to know what you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is know why their,</v>

1087
00:53:25.541 --> 00:53:26.374
<v Speaker 5>the bases have to be like Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem like their faces are a </v>

1088
00:53:29.011 --> 00:53:30.600
<v Speaker 5>little creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1089
00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:31.270
<v Speaker 5>thank you.</v>

1090
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 5>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if it's sexual,</v>

1091
00:53:32.881 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 5>it's just a dry humping,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1092
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.730
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they cut a hole.</v>

1093
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:39.880
<v Speaker 5>There's a hole like the Mormons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's more like,</v>

1094
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:46.510
<v Speaker 5>it's gotta be like a Velcro flap now </v>
<v Speaker 5>that sex,</v>

1095
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.130
<v Speaker 5>but I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1096
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.983
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's kind of Nice if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>attractive as a whole bunch of them </v>

1097
00:53:51.151 --> 00:53:56.151
<v Speaker 5>there thing and you don't know who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>black open and who's fights flaps closed</v>

1098
00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.800
<v Speaker 5>and there's a photo you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess if you're real ugly,</v>

1099
00:54:01.801 --> 00:54:02.634
<v Speaker 5>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know myself and you've gone a Fox </v>

1100
00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:07.404
<v Speaker 5>outfit and you showed deck and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got a good one and your face </v>

1101
00:54:09.421 --> 00:54:10.254
<v Speaker 5>isn't that good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then all of sudden you're like king of </v>

1102
00:54:12.481 --> 00:54:14.430
<v Speaker 5>the furries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It works to your advantage.</v>

1103
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.293
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think that's like 50% of the reason </v>

1104
00:54:16.501 --> 00:54:20.460
<v Speaker 5>why people go for maybe what you're kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of hiding your identity.</v>

1105
00:54:20.461 --> 00:54:22.260
<v Speaker 5>You can't really see everyone's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>equal.</v>

1106
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.093
<v Speaker 5>And just in Nicaragua it's kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>eyes wide shut but ridiculous if you </v>

1107
00:54:29.071 --> 00:54:31.950
<v Speaker 5>have to adopt a furry voice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know like her pet boy.</v>

1108
00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.153
<v Speaker 5>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do that then do you guys know if </v>

1109
00:54:35.491 --> 00:54:36.324
<v Speaker 5>they talk [inaudible] I mean I know that</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is a role playing aspect so I </v>

1110
00:54:42.631 --> 00:54:46.560
<v Speaker 5>imagine that that Dan is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1111
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:51.210
<v Speaker 5>you're going to this length zoom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would assume the voice as well.</v>

1112
00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:54.880
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I think we should go under cover.</v>

1113
00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:58.620
<v Speaker 5>Well you paint your Dick reade like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>red rocket.</v>

1114
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:01.250
<v Speaker 5>Not Often Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1115
00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:05.310
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they might just looked it up.</v>

1116
00:55:05.311 --> 00:55:09.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean on their wikipedia about for </v>
<v Speaker 5>these the sexual aspect,</v>

1117
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:11.570
<v Speaker 5>it's fairly far down in the article </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1118
00:55:11.571 --> 00:55:14.940
<v Speaker 5>There's quite a bit to the sub culture </v>
<v Speaker 5>other than the sexual aspect.</v>

1119
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:17.370
<v Speaker 5>Although I will note that the sexual </v>
<v Speaker 5>aspect,</v>

1120
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:18.970
<v Speaker 5>that is the biggest part of the article.</v>

1121
00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:22.260
<v Speaker 5>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These guys fuck like crazy.</v>

1122
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.440
<v Speaker 5>I think it's more about the cuddling </v>
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>

1123
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:29.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think that's what that's about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to get snugly?</v>

1124
00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to get hot.</v>

1125
00:55:31.591 --> 00:55:33.270
<v Speaker 5>And I think all the first watching her </v>
<v Speaker 5>and being like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's great to see Bob just bust out in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1175
00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:41.533
<v Speaker 5>in the sole role.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I now take over the famous for being on </v>

1176
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:47.320
<v Speaker 5>better call Saul,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was before that,</v>

1177
00:57:47.321 --> 00:57:47.891
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1178
00:57:47.891 --> 00:57:48.491
<v Speaker 5>bob.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1179
00:57:48.491 --> 00:57:51.190
<v Speaker 5>he's always doing so many great things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah.</v>

1180
00:57:51.191 --> 00:57:52.024
<v Speaker 5>How was that watching him have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>breakout and like the breaking bad </v>

1181
00:57:53.921 --> 00:57:54.461
<v Speaker 5>world?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1182
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:55.810
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's so good.</v>

1183
00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:56.863
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he's just a dramatic actor now </v>

1184
00:57:58.391 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that he's just taken in onto that</v>

1185
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:01.893
<v Speaker 5>so amazingly and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's getting other parts to left and </v>

1186
00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:05.170

1187
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:06.910
<v Speaker 5>Well each rose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for me it's,</v>

1188
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:10.180
<v Speaker 5>I always think if that is like a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>side thing that he's done,</v>

1189
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:12.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't think of that as the main part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of him.</v>

1190
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:16.630
<v Speaker 5>The main part of Bob Odenkirk is genius </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedic.</v>

1191
00:58:16.631 --> 00:58:20.310
<v Speaker 5>Mine came out of SNL.</v>

1192
00:58:20.311 --> 00:58:23.000
<v Speaker 5>on snl just as a rider.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1193
00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:24.780
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1194
00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:25.923
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything that he touched seemed to </v>

1195
00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.920
<v Speaker 5>turn to gold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He and,</v>

1196
00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:31.763
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were really lucky to cross paths </v>

1197
00:58:34.091 --> 00:58:35.770
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with him and David Cross.</v>

1198
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.530

<v Speaker 5>we owe them everything.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They gave us the big break.</v>

1200
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.173

<v Speaker 5>break into the industry or in the 90s </v>

<v Speaker 5>on a fan forum.</v>

1304
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:38.280
<v Speaker 5>So let me allow me to read some to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This one comes from pj four,</v>

1305
01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:38.761
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four,</v>

1306
01:03:38.761 --> 01:03:39.880
<v Speaker 5>two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1307
01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:41.520
<v Speaker 5>this one's for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jack.</v>

1308
01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:44.640
<v Speaker 5>What was the Eric Andre interview like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did,</v>

1309
01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:45.623
<v Speaker 5>did you know what you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself into and were there any </v>

1310
01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:48.600
<v Speaker 5>surprises?</v>

1311
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.301
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1312
01:03:49.301 --> 01:03:50.134
<v Speaker 3>I knew what I was getting into in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a huge fan of Eric Andre and I knew </v>

1313
01:03:54.491 --> 01:03:55.324
<v Speaker 3>it was going to be some sick shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was a little nervous about it </v>

1314
01:03:57.441 --> 01:03:59.320
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he going to treat me bad?</v>

1315
01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.120
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1316
01:04:01.121 --> 01:04:04.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was what you'd expect.</v>

1317
01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:10.260
<v Speaker 3>It was about 112 degrees on the set by </v>
<v Speaker 3>design to make me uncomfortable.</v>

1318
01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:13.410
<v Speaker 3>I was sweating profusely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1319
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:17.050
<v Speaker 3>it smelled horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I found out why later they were</v>

1320
01:04:17.051 --> 01:04:22.051
<v Speaker 3>boiling hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rodding a squid carcasses underneath the</v>

1321
01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.300
<v Speaker 3>floor boards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1322
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:26.650
<v Speaker 3>and there was also some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1323
01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.060
<v Speaker 3>some surprises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1324
01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:31.300
<v Speaker 3>here's a little bit of a electroshock </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy.</v>

1325
01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:36.100
<v Speaker 3>Every time we did a lie detector tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way it was torture,</v>

1326
01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:37.323
<v Speaker 3>but it was also like a rite of passage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it was a late Bar Mitzvah </v>

1327
01:04:41.081 --> 01:04:45.310
<v Speaker 3>for me if I could survive the Eric Andre</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

1328
01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.453
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1329
01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:48.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1330
01:04:48.321 --> 01:04:50.120
<v Speaker 5>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so funny.</v>

1331
01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.133
<v Speaker 5>It was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the soda come in or the coffee </v>

1332
01:04:53.121 --> 01:04:55.220
<v Speaker 5>coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was pure surprise.</v>

1333
01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:59.580
<v Speaker 3>My plan was to try to just approach it </v>
<v Speaker 3>like any other talk show.</v>

1334
01:04:59.581 --> 01:05:04.280
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm going on Conan O'brien now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>do like a funny little entrance like I,</v>

1335
01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.390
<v Speaker 3>I usually do.</v>

1336
01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:10.550
<v Speaker 5>And then just descend into hell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1337
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:12.110
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1338
01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:13.283
<v Speaker 5>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I highly recommend it if you get a </v>

1339
01:05:16.301 --> 01:05:18.340
<v Speaker 5>chance to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to embrace</v>

1340
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.173
<v Speaker 3>the madness.</v>

1341
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:20.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is eric on.</v>

1342
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.970
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was so happy to see you there.</v>

1343
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:25.930
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this one comes from incendiary war pig.</v>

1344
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.180
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1345
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:28.023
<v Speaker 5>which tenacious d song do you guys most </v>
<v Speaker 5>enjoy performing and how many cockup </v>

1346
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.810
<v Speaker 5>Cock pushups can you do today?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Often asked.</v>

1347
01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:40.090
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>off to ask questions in there.</v>

1348
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.050
<v Speaker 5>The cockroach up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer,</v>

1349
01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.890
<v Speaker 5>the real answer is you only need to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

1350
01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:45.980
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1351
01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:53.470
<v Speaker 5>Can you still do one though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm afraid I,</v>

1352
01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:55.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't have,</v>

1353
01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.650
<v Speaker 5>you cannot have more out there.</v>

1354
01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

1355
01:05:58.850 --> 01:05:59.683
<v Speaker 3>I can do a partial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a granny pushup there has </v>

1356
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:06.200
<v Speaker 3>to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be from the knees and I do all</v>

1357
01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:08.510
<v Speaker 3>that little hub,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can still get there.</v>

1358
01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.230
<v Speaker 3>What song do you like to play the most?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1359
01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.070
<v Speaker 3>it's always fun to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1360
01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:16.880
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1361
01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.713
<v Speaker 3>to play the crowd pleasers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of the deep cuts that I </v>

1362
01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:24.380
<v Speaker 3>enjoy the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is a throw down.</v>

1363
01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:27.620
<v Speaker 3>I know that in the funnel and it's got </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1364
01:06:27.621 --> 01:06:29.720
<v Speaker 3>it's got some biblical references in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1365
01:06:29.721 --> 01:06:34.721
<v Speaker 3>We kind of go deep and it's about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dangers of,</v>

1366
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:39.920
<v Speaker 3>of blindly following a organized </v>
<v Speaker 3>religions and about how it could,</v>

1367
01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:43.640
<v Speaker 3>it could end up being the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of the world for all of us.</v>

1368
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:47.930
<v Speaker 3>The Battle of the three major,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1369
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.003
<v Speaker 3>you start with the Judaism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moses came down from the hill and then </v>

1370
01:06:53.451 --> 01:06:57.490
<v Speaker 3>you go to Jesus and then you go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>one that you can't say,</v>

1371
01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.780
<v Speaker 3>did he say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his date in the song?</v>

1372
01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.820
<v Speaker 3>The three of them end up battling in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rain.</v>

1373
01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:10.290
<v Speaker 3>The world is completely insane sounding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alarm bombs.</v>

1374
01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:12.150
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1375
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.983
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said what I wrote down was what was </v>

1376
01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:15.464
<v Speaker 3>that song about originally?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember we kind of tweaked a little </v>

1377
01:07:17.301 --> 01:07:18.134
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>

1378
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:19.431
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1379
01:07:19.431 --> 01:07:21.970
<v Speaker 3>we had the jam for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1380
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:24.710
<v Speaker 3>for months and we didn't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lyrics would be.</v>

1381
01:07:24.711 --> 01:07:26.710
<v Speaker 3>And then we finally realized this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Champions.</v>

1382
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.070
<v Speaker 3>So have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's important.</v>

1383
01:07:28.071 --> 01:07:28.904
<v Speaker 3>It's an important jam is his needs toss </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hit that we leave with the big guns </v>

1384
01:07:33.531 --> 01:07:36.190
<v Speaker 3>we're going after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was it about before that?</v>

1385
01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:42.850
<v Speaker 3>One line is we're clowns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we do like to get serious sometimes.</v>

1386
01:07:43.401 --> 01:07:47.330
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that's that those are the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun ones when we tackle real issues,</v>

1387
01:07:47.331 --> 01:07:47.850
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1388
01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:49.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I that makes me think,</v>

1389
01:07:49.801 --> 01:07:52.020
<v Speaker 5>cause I was watching post apocalypto </v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>

1390
01:07:52.021 --> 01:07:52.854
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fair for me to ask any question was </v>

1391
01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:57.930
<v Speaker 5>spreading that swollen too and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want that dog part of the flavor,</v>

1392
01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:03.080
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think he's hypoallergenic.</v>

<v Speaker 3>survive the lock lips,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1519
01:13:41.991 --> 01:13:44.720
<v Speaker 3>a big part of it also when we're making </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was that,</v>

1520
01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:46.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1521

<v Speaker 3>that is donald trump's the,</v>

1522
01:13:53.031 --> 01:13:53.864
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1523
01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:54.853
<v Speaker 3>the phenomenon that is his astronomic </v>
<v Speaker 3>rise to power because we have a little </v>

1524
01:13:59.271 --> 01:14:02.810
<v Speaker 3>seed of his disease too.</v>

<v Speaker 3>what is it called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kyle.</v>

1526
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:06.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a grandiosity.</v>

1527
01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Narcissism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>narcissism,</v>

1528
01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.270
<v Speaker 3>narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>egotistical,</v>

1529
01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:12.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disorder.</v>

1530
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:15.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we,</v>

1531
01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.480
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1532
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:17.623
<v Speaker 3>have made our whole careers on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing about saying we're the greatest </v>

1533
01:14:20.501 --> 01:14:22.150
<v Speaker 3>band in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1534
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.600
<v Speaker 3>everything flows through us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are the best band ever.</v>

1535
01:14:25.601 --> 01:14:26.434
<v Speaker 3>And our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our biggest hit song was the first song </v>

1536
01:14:28.001 --> 01:14:29.920
<v Speaker 3>we ever wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1537
01:14:29.921 --> 01:14:30.754
<v Speaker 3>the greatest song in the world tribute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when we see this guy coming out </v>

1538
01:14:34.001 --> 01:14:34.580
<v Speaker 3>and he'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1539
01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.413
<v Speaker 3>good winning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the best of movement of we know </v>

1540
01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:39.760
<v Speaker 3>that scam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's planned,</v>

1541
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:41.680
<v Speaker 3>that Shell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not joking.</v>

1542
01:14:41.681 --> 01:14:43.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the only difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1543
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:44.783
<v Speaker 3>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I started to think about other </v>

1544
01:14:46.361 --> 01:14:50.620
<v Speaker 3>people in the industry who have made a </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge career out of this.</v>

1545
01:14:50.621 --> 01:14:51.454
<v Speaker 3>And you think of like Howard Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the king of all media and he's the best </v>

1546
01:14:54.701 --> 01:14:56.760
<v Speaker 3>and he's kind of joking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's also kind of Nice,</v>

1547
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:59.980
<v Speaker 3>kind of got the narcissistic looking in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mirror all the time,</v>

1548
01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:00.814
<v Speaker 3>talking about how great he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you look around at other </v>

1549
01:15:02.471 --> 01:15:04.360
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to see like Kanye West,</v>

1550
01:15:04.361 --> 01:15:06.070
<v Speaker 3>he's the greatest and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1551
01:15:06.071 --> 01:15:11.071
<v Speaker 3>creating and you see different people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop culture that I have this disease and</v>

1552
01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:16.090
<v Speaker 3>are succeeding because the world that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in now embraces it.</v>

1553
01:15:16.091 --> 01:15:17.800
<v Speaker 3>And they love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love a narcissist.</v>

1554
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1555
01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:19.481
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1556
01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:20.314
<v Speaker 3>it seems like particular to these times </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now we are vulnerable to Psychos </v>

1557
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:27.880
<v Speaker 3>who think they are the greatest thing.</v>

1558
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:33.790
<v Speaker 5>People are so accepting of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>grandiose that people are like love that</v>

1559
01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:37.460
<v Speaker 5>larger than life figure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it all?</v>

1560
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:38.383
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's always been like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you had said like today people are </v>

1561
01:15:40.571 --> 01:15:43.030
<v Speaker 5>more accepting of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder why that is.</v>

1562
01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.553
<v Speaker 5>What do you think kyle?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kyle knows all the answers to </v>

1563
01:15:46.211 --> 01:15:47.650
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>

1564
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:48.484
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just doing a nicorette piece of gum </v>

1565
01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:53.110
<v Speaker 5>with this down over here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't pay on the camera.</v>

1566
01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:57.640
<v Speaker 3>He stole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to think of an answer we</v>

1567
01:15:57.650 --> 01:16:01.720
<v Speaker 3>talks about as nicotine gum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that a celebrity is a,</v>

1568
01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:04.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm kind of the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

1569
01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.970
<v Speaker 5>the cachet of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of modern society.</v>

1570
01:16:07.971 --> 01:16:11.060
<v Speaker 5>It seems like it's overly valued and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>

1571
01:16:11.061 --> 01:16:11.894
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think Donald was spent 14 years being </v>

1572
01:16:15.021 --> 01:16:15.854
<v Speaker 5>branded over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this kind of a super smart business </v>

1573
01:16:20.241 --> 01:16:21.074
<v Speaker 5>guy self made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think unfortunately that can </v>

1574
01:16:24.441 --> 01:16:26.270
<v Speaker 5>really work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And just repetition.</v>

1575
01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:29.700
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's certain just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>dynamics at work that,</v>

1576
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.230
<v Speaker 5>that we know that if you just keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>repeating something over and over again,</v>

1577
01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:38.320
<v Speaker 5>the pinnacle can marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>

1578
01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:40.430
<v Speaker 5>I like the best marketing campaign ever.</v>

1579
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:45.890
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we thought it would be good to go.</v>

1580
01:16:45.891 --> 01:16:46.724
<v Speaker 3>Flash forward to the whole world has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been destroyed by this mega maniacal </v>

1581
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:55.580
<v Speaker 3>demon beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1582
01:16:55.670 --> 01:16:59.610
<v Speaker 3>we have to pick up the pieces because </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the great movies in,</v>

1583
01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:04.660
<v Speaker 3>in our opinion are the post apocalyptic </v>
<v Speaker 3>science fiction masterpieces,</v>

1584
01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.130
<v Speaker 3>road warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1585
01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:09.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terminator,</v>

1586
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:10.920
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

1587
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:12.613
<v Speaker 5>wizard of Oz.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are the movies I think we can all </v>

1588
01:17:15.951 --> 01:17:20.951
<v Speaker 5>agree objective are the best movies ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>made and they are warnings.</v>

1589
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:24.300
<v Speaker 5>They are like look out for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we wanted it,</v>

1590
01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:26.750
<v Speaker 5>we wanted to jump into that sphere </v>
<v Speaker 5>because not,</v>

1591
01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:31.780
<v Speaker 5>not only because we love those movies </v>
<v Speaker 5>but also because it seemed like what the</v>

1592
01:17:32.061 --> 01:17:32.894
<v Speaker 5>world needs now and only a narcissist </v>
<v Speaker 5>could think that they could save the </v>

1593
01:17:36.321 --> 01:17:38.300
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's where [inaudible] comes in.</v>

1594
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:43.510
<v Speaker 5>We are the antidote to the demon because</v>
<v Speaker 5>we are the demon.</v>

1595
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:48.610
<v Speaker 5>Well I don't know where I'm talking </v>
