<v Speaker 1>heartbeat.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now this video comes courtesy of your </v>

71
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:41.494
<v Speaker 1>boy Tom Segura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw this on instagram and I had to </v>

72
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:45.604
<v Speaker 1>share it with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a professional boxer who is </v>

73
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>having a promoting a big fight he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>

74
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.703
<v Speaker 1>and I'm this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to break this down for you </v>

75
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>guys cause it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so wild.</v>

76
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me show you the video.</v>

77
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.013
<v Speaker 1>So he's on a daytime television show on </v>
<v Speaker 1>some mascot comes out dressed in a </v>

78
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>burrito and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was meant to punch him in the</v>

79
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>stomach cause you can see the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>space and like hit him right here.</v>

80
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Hit him right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this box,</v>

81
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>this is a boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world class fighter.</v>

82
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>He punches this fucking guy in the face </v>
<v Speaker 1>as hard as he can do it.</v>

83
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>And you could tell that Burrito,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Tortilla padding just isn't enough.</v>

84
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.450
<v Speaker 1>So let's see who is usually inside those</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

85
00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:32.810
<v Speaker 1>It's totally like he's the guy,</v>

86
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.830
<v Speaker 2>not someone who can take a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

87
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he broke</v>

88
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.093
<v Speaker 1>son of bitches jar and you see him </v>
<v Speaker 1>writhing around in pain and everyone's </v>

89
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 1>kind of clowning on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

90
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like trying to touch like yeah.</v>

91
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.691
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

92
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:56.524
<v Speaker 1>I'm not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone's clowning on him one more </v>

93
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right in the stomach</v>

94
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.740
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh cool.</v>

<v Speaker 1>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

97
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it's his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

98
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.323
<v Speaker 1>The host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't know if anyone speaks </v>

99
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:27.820

101
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 1>that poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably had like padding,</v>

<v Speaker 1>frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.980
<v Speaker 1>He beat the salsa right out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brewery.</v>

121
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Not a Mexican joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A burrito joke.</v>

122
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.144
<v Speaker 1>Let's be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten way more class and </v>

123
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 1>integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a race related jokes about,</v>

124
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.833
<v Speaker 1>cause they put salsa and Burritos as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as rice and beans and stuff like </v>

125
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was not,</v>

126
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.820
<v Speaker 1>or do I need to make an apology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>here's another good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.103

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.010

<v Speaker 1>but we're just getting started here.</v>

132
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.920
<v Speaker 1>A lubing it up or lighten it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

133
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.053
<v Speaker 1>So this person decided to order a pizza </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they put a sign on the door that </v>

134
00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:13.350
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scream shannon,</v>

135
00:07:13.351 --> 00:07:16.350
<v Speaker 1>your pizza is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not ring the doorbell or knock,</v>

136
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.350
<v Speaker 1>our grandma is sleeping upstairs cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

137
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about somebody leaving</v>

138
00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:26.730
<v Speaker 1>a sign on a door for pizza delivery guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to scream?</v>

139
00:07:26.731 --> 00:07:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Shannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pizza's here.</v>

140
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.300
<v Speaker 1>No one would actually do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:33.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's asking a lot of a pizza guy scream.</v>

142
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Most favor will probably not even read </v>
<v Speaker 1>the letter.</v>

143
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not about asking someone to scream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like,</v>

144
00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.370
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this guy,</v>

146
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.683
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he receives the note and he </v>

147
00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:50.760
<v Speaker 1>reciprocates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did the note say again?</v>

148
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.410
<v Speaker 1>It said script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please scream.</v>

149
00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:53.244
<v Speaker 1>Shannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pizza's here because my grandma's </v>

150
00:07:54.781 --> 00:07:56.760

<v Speaker 1>We'll rake my Nana.</v>

151
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.410
<v Speaker 1>So let's see how this brilliant mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>reacts to that.</v>

152
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.220
<v Speaker 1>And look at this guy strutting up like a</v>

<v Speaker 1>he assesses the situation.</v>

155
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.550
<v Speaker 1>He strolls up with the confidence of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand food buzz,</v>

156
00:08:14.551 --> 00:08:15.420
<v Speaker 1>a thousand pies.</v>

157

<v Speaker 1>I am wondering if this was his way of </v>

<v Speaker 1>being like fuck you for making me a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shout.</v>

173
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit of rebellion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malicious compliance.</v>

174
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nana woke the fuck up from that.</v>

00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 1>she opens a door and he continues to </v>
<v Speaker 1>scream in her face.</v>

177
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:15.354
<v Speaker 1>So you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wonder if it was a revenge cause </v>

00:13:20.481 --> 00:13:23.900
<v Speaker 1>the first episode we watched and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even notice.</v>

255
00:13:23.901 --> 00:13:24.734
<v Speaker 1>We thought it was 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just all of a sudden it was like </v>

256
00:13:27.201 --> 00:13:28.310
<v Speaker 1>1:30</v>

<v Speaker 1>How did that happen?</v>

258
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.050
<v Speaker 1>By yesterday we were watching an </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>

259
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.210

<v Speaker 1>And it's been forever.</v>

260
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.160
<v Speaker 1>And then it sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long is this?</v>

261
00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:40.790
<v Speaker 1>It feels like we've been sitting here </v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile and I was like,</v>

262
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:42.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 minutes or something.</v>

263
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.400
<v Speaker 1>And we look and it's still all had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>already watching for an hour and a half.</v>

264
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.043
<v Speaker 1>And we thought we were watching a 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute show and didn't even notice our </v>

265
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.580
<v Speaker 1>episodes.</v>

266
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your tlc is like Las Vegas.</v>

267
00:13:55.611 --> 00:13:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Like they hold you there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:13:57.801 --> 00:13:59.930
<v Speaker 1>in Vegas they like don't have lights or </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows.</v>

269
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:00.973
<v Speaker 1>They like hold you hostage there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like hide the fact that you've </v>

270
00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:06.350
<v Speaker 1>been hostage in their network for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

271
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.243
<v Speaker 1>And even the commercials are interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they show all the other weird </v>

272
00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:11.500
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dev on til five,</v>

273
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.560
<v Speaker 1>lots of novasure yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

274
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Self promote little people with giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

275
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.860
<v Speaker 1>And you were just laughing and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

276
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.450
<v Speaker 1>So you were doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't even skip the commercials.</v>

277
00:14:20.451 --> 00:14:23.250
<v Speaker 1>We really watched the whole two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

278
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.660
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so 90 day fiance,</v>

279
00:14:26.661 --> 00:14:29.960
<v Speaker 1>this show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole premise is so insane and I,</v>

280
00:14:29.961 --> 00:14:31.370
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I stressed that.</v>

281
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:32.204
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know how it's illegal </v>
<v Speaker 1>because first it's usually starts with </v>

282
00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:39.200
<v Speaker 1>them overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they have attorneys so it is legal,</v>

283
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.430
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

284
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably have some slick attorneys </v>

285
00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.960
<v Speaker 1>making sure that they're not getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>deported.</v>

286
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.393
<v Speaker 1>But it starts overseas usually and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bringing over on some kind of </v>

287
00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:53.264
<v Speaker 1>visa and they have 90 days to decide if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to get married because they </v>

288
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:58.910
<v Speaker 1>have to decide the visa expires in 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

289
00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have to decide,</v>

290
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:05.081
<v Speaker 1>am I going to marry you and immigrate or</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I not like you and I'm leaving.</v>

291
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 1>And the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

292
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:10.370
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that would subject themselves</v>

293
00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 1>to this already fucked in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

294
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.390
<v Speaker 5>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>

295
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 5>They're apparently somehow in love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They met somehow.</v>

296
00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 5>That's how it usually is.</v>

297
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean like who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

298
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

299
00:15:21.721 --> 00:15:26.280
<v Speaker 1>who would invite Tlc cameos and to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship during this difficult time?</v>

300
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.180
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

301
00:15:27.181 --> 00:15:28.740
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second of all,</v>

302
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.850
<v Speaker 1>the way they select couples is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible because they'll only,</v>

303
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.350
<v Speaker 1>they will specifically fine the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

304
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.273
<v Speaker 1>and you look at them and you say there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is no way that person cares about the </v>

305
00:15:41.761 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 1>other person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

306
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause like my favorite couple is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy David and Annie.</v>

307
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.780
<v Speaker 1>This Guy David is a 45 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's overweight,</v>

308
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.360
<v Speaker 1>he's broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has no prospect,</v>

309
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.223
<v Speaker 1>no prospects in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the girl was like 24 24 sometime we </v>

310
00:15:58.771 --> 00:16:02.280
<v Speaker 1>met and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the reoccurring message.</v>

311
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.820
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to this other person </v>
<v Speaker 1>cares.</v>

312
00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:07.430
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>do you have any skepticism that it's </v>

446
00:22:49.771 --> 00:22:51.330
<v Speaker 1>real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like,</v>

447
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Hour,</v>

448
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I ask myself all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

449
00:22:55.321 --> 00:22:57.540
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you this here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

450
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I just don't accept that these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are good enough actors.</v>

451
00:23:03.211 --> 00:23:04.044
<v Speaker 1>The pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you worked like just doing sketchy </v>

452
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.103
<v Speaker 1>doing sketches for Rv?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very even a normal person that's </v>

453
00:23:09.981 --> 00:23:10.814
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been around performance in front </v>

454
00:23:12.061 --> 00:23:12.894
<v Speaker 1>of the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to tell when someone's </v>

455
00:23:14.341 --> 00:23:15.370
<v Speaker 1>acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

456
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that these are not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>like also the action.</v>

457
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.440
<v Speaker 1>They followed them for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

458
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a on faith.</v>

459
00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.320
<v Speaker 1>How does that couple do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We made a video about,</v>

460
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.210
<v Speaker 1>you can still see youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a youtube channels.</v>

461
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.510
<v Speaker 1>I think if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the producers probably,</v>

462
00:23:34.511 --> 00:23:35.344
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instigate the manipulate and manipulate </v>

463
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.990
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

464
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.210
<v Speaker 1>this is real as a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

465
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:47.360
<v Speaker 1>this is real as a bowl of spicy my dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gave me a heart attack.</v>

466
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.010
<v Speaker 1>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a happy ending.</v>

467
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine when he started saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>we would like you to volunteer?</v>

468
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I thought maybe they have a charity that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants her to come vulnerable.</v>

469
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:03.404
<v Speaker 1>You're at job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could just say maybe it'd be nice if </v>

470
00:24:10.301 --> 00:24:13.760
<v Speaker 1>you could just help around the house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

825
00:42:15.501 --> 00:42:16.334
<v Speaker 1>we're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real life effect reminiscent of the </v>

826
00:42:18.141 --> 00:42:20.050
<v Speaker 1>original star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very practical,</v>

827
00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 1>practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very practical.</v>

828
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope everyone had,</v>

829
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.753
<v Speaker 1>had really enjoyed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now let me tell you about Ethan </v>

830
00:42:27.771 --> 00:42:28.604
<v Speaker 1>client.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

831
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:34.270
<v Speaker 1>This liberal Jew has openly admitted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>v I don't really like that this way.</v>

832
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I think this liberal Jew has openly </v>
<v Speaker 1>admitted to voting for Hillary Clinton,</v>

833
00:42:42.591 --> 00:42:46.340
<v Speaker 1>who by the way has eaten at least 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies in the basement of a pizza joint.</v>

834
00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

835
00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Now if you are going to pick up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lacroix,</v>

836
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.733
<v Speaker 1>you might as well eat a baby because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the liberals in Hollywood </v>

837
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.550
<v Speaker 1>are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen George Clooney?</v>

838
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:58.250
<v Speaker 1>He's 60 years old and he looks like he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years old.</v>

839
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.990
<v Speaker 1>How does he achieve that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not by Jacob McCoy eating babies.</v>

840
00:43:02.991 --> 00:43:03.824
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ila</v>

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:07.103

<v Speaker 1>Clooney at the age of 60,</v>

846
00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.633
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need to inject baby for </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin and Tier Gooch test the area </v>

847
00:43:22.991 --> 00:43:25.270

884
00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

885
00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.670
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

886
00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.593
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

887
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:27.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

888
00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.900
<v Speaker 1>What this guy on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

889
00:45:31.901 --> 00:45:35.590
<v Speaker 1>that's not divided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let's divide that.</v>

890
00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.513
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound like enough date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you crunched the numbers </v>

891
00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:39.700
<v Speaker 1>on this end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,000</v>

892
00:45:39.701 --> 00:45:42.520
<v Speaker 1>divided by three 65 you're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

893
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.380
<v Speaker 1>he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 41 years old.</v>

894
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Hey Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put,</v>

895
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.090
<v Speaker 1>you put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sowed doubt in my mind about Ian's.</v>

896
00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Never doubt when it comes to Konya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

897
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:53.223
<v Speaker 1>never questioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think he's bitten off more </v>

898
00:45:55.061 --> 00:45:57.880
<v Speaker 1>than he can chew him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What his column there it looks like.</v>

899
00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean I think the fourth one down,</v>

900
00:46:05.381 --> 00:46:08.800
<v Speaker 1>speak to George LucasLucas' wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think very doable.</v>

901
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Accomplish accomplishment for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll definitely smart.</v>

902
00:46:13.091 --> 00:46:16.120
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also invite Wellsmith to record.</v>

903
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:21.490
<v Speaker 1>That's very doable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just invites him transform.</v>

904
00:46:21.491 --> 00:46:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Zoos seems a little more complex than </v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

905
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.140
<v Speaker 1>but what do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not calling you with,</v>

906
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got other things.</v>

907
00:46:29.231 --> 00:46:30.460
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in Uganda,</v>

908
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:32.463
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on music and here he is passing </v>

909
00:46:35.681 --> 00:46:40.681
<v Speaker 1>out yeezys to poverty stricken Uganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ugandans.</v>

910
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Now the funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a couple of thoughts about this.</v>

911
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.963
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids don't know what do they feed </v>

912
00:46:55.341 --> 00:46:56.960
<v Speaker 2>their family with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

913
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And the second thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one pair though,</v>

914
00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.370
<v Speaker 2>probably like a year salary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if some guy,</v>

915
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:08.263
<v Speaker 2>some dudes with machetes are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come club them over the head and still </v>

916
00:47:11.001 --> 00:47:14.920
<v Speaker 2>there easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

917
00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like just his outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fun and like it's all Balenciaga</v>

918
00:47:21.101 --> 00:47:24.550
<v Speaker 1>and all this like high design or </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive designer clothes.</v>

919
00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is too funny.</v>

920
00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:29.373
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Kanye is response to like any </v>

921
00:47:31.871 --> 00:47:34.900
<v Speaker 1>situation pass out easys like on talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

922
00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:35.734
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Kimmel came out and easy trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave a pair of yeezys Uganda yeezys </v>

923
00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:41.434
<v Speaker 1>for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you think this is a fair piece </v>

924
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:47.080
<v Speaker 1>offering or was easy as not </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate gift?</v>

925
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:48.543
<v Speaker 1>He gave some to the president of Uganda </v>
<v Speaker 1>to and he was like thanks for the </v>

926
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:53.170
<v Speaker 1>sneakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't,</v>

927
00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.820
<v Speaker 1>they definitely don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeezys are,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't pay enough for the kids know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president promised thanks for the </v>

929

<v Speaker 1>that's not going to stay wide.</v>

933

<v Speaker 1>let's go back to our new video.</v>

1116
00:58:23.921 --> 00:58:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our new video was about the Tlc cat fish</v>

1117
00:58:27.911 --> 00:58:29.770
<v Speaker 1>and this whole thing about gazebos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1118
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:34.060
<v Speaker 1>And the host of that show was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1119
00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.081
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his full name?</v>

1120
00:58:35.081 --> 00:58:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I know his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elliot,</v>

1121
00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.800
<v Speaker 1>but I don't remember if Morgan Elliot </v>
<v Speaker 1>Morgan.</v>

1122
00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:39.663
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't met him once on the set of </v>

1123
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:44.433
<v Speaker 1>smarsh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a game show with him on smash and </v>

1124
00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:49.293
<v Speaker 1>I realized only about halfway through </v>
<v Speaker 1>recording because he looks super </v>

1125
00:58:52.811 --> 00:58:54.920
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now he's got a beard.</v>

1126
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him too,</v>

1127
00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:59.580
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't realize it was him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1128
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:04.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at whatever you guys get it.</v>

1129
00:59:04.721 --> 00:59:06.040
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1130
00:59:06.041 --> 00:59:06.874
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1131
00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:08.903
<v Speaker 1>it looked like him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't believe it was the same </v>

1132
00:59:10.681 --> 00:59:13.000
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1133
00:59:13.001 --> 00:59:14.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you pointed it out,</v>

1134
00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it all look like Elliot?</v>

1135
00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:19.800
<v Speaker 1>This is halfway through recording where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he started the video and she's like,</v>

1136
00:59:19.801 --> 00:59:21.350
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1137
00:59:21.351 --> 00:59:21.891
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1138
00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:23.750
<v Speaker 1>There's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks so much like him.</v>

1139
00:59:23.751 --> 00:59:24.584
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of uncanny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I look up the credits of the </v>

1140
00:59:26.811 --> 00:59:27.950
<v Speaker 1>show and sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Elliot.</v>

1141
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Now a lot of people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you mention,</v>

1142
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to,</v>

1143
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1144
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't trying to personally attack the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1145
00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was best to not mention him</v>

1146
00:59:41.701 --> 00:59:44.040
<v Speaker 1>by name or even to acknowledge it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't,</v>

1147
00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to give the Guy Shit,</v>

1148
00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fuck him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1149
00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.360
<v Speaker 1>We just make it fun to show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of the persona he was playing.</v>

1150
00:59:52.361 --> 00:59:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1151
00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:56.980
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not his show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1152
00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:59.120
<v Speaker 1>so it's not really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1153
00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.700
<v Speaker 1>he's project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1154
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I hope none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just,</v>

1155
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not leaving to go after people </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally.</v>

1156
01:00:05.081 --> 01:00:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm just not trying to do that.</v>

1158
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And so we were trying to think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we,</v>

1159
01:00:11.321 --> 01:00:13.570

01:00:48.041 --> 01:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>So they made a sketch and response to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Ngozi Bros.</v>

1175
01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.673
<v Speaker 1>So I thought we could enjoy it here </v>
<v Speaker 1>today in honor of them embracing the </v>

1176
01:00:56.411 --> 01:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>main shut up to Elliot Morgan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless him.</v>

1177

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the h three h d totally </v>

1178
01:01:07.561 --> 01:01:09.990

<v Speaker 2>Let me turn it up.</v>

1179
01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:10.883
<v Speaker 2>So then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really ever hosted Elliot </v>

1180
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Partial Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you start over again?</v>

1181
01:01:16.831 --> 01:01:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Because I talked over and I really watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>the youtube video in like 15 years.</v>

1182
01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:21.690
<v Speaker 2>That sounds pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1183
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:24.833
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a 14 year old girl looking at </v>

1184
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:28.243
<v Speaker 2>fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see you can make fun of Elliot </v>

1185
01:01:29.911 --> 01:01:32.250
<v Speaker 2>for doing that really bad fish show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1186
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I did Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm in here.</v>

1187
01:01:33.931 --> 01:01:36.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm hiding from residual embarrassment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jokes aside,</v>

1188
01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:40.980
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of moron goes on a cap?</v>

1189
01:01:40.981 --> 01:01:43.190
<v Speaker 2>This show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good company.</v>

1190
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I like Ariana Grande Day and coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dear Google,</v>

1191
01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:56.400
<v Speaker 2>do actions have consequences or can I </v>
<v Speaker 2>get away with Elliott Elliott?</v>

1192
01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:57.323
<v Speaker 2>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that Ethan from h three h </v>

1193
01:01:58.501 --> 01:02:01.050
<v Speaker 2>three roasted your ass on national </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet?</v>

1194
01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1195
01:02:02.041 --> 01:02:04.350
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't seen it?</v>

1196
01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I want him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

1197
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:07.343
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1198
01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.230
<v Speaker 2>get ready to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was probably,</v>

1199
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>when he saw that I made a video about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1200
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:13.340
<v Speaker 1>he was probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1201
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

1202
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:18.200
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't want him to watch it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel bad.</v>

1203
01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.034
<v Speaker 1>That was my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I hope he didn't based on the </v>

1204
01:02:21.751 --> 01:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they took it and uh,</v>

1205
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>and I think they definitely made the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best of it.</v>

1206
01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:28.164
<v Speaker 1>I mean the video did really good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they made a really funny video response </v>

1207
01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:31.434
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1208
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:32.483
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>

1209
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.690
<v Speaker 2>And then also feel the cold tied to </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional shame wash over your body.</v>

1210
01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:37.951
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe?</v>

1211
01:02:37.951 --> 01:02:38.784
<v Speaker 2>Well here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Internet comments are just </v>

1212
01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:41.664
<v Speaker 2>manifestations of truths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came buried deep within for fear of </v>

1213
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:44.334
<v Speaker 2>confronting them head on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to act like you're a </v>

1214
01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:48.210
<v Speaker 2>predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a zip thing.</v>

1215
01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:49.680
<v Speaker 2>He looks so much different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1216
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.720
<v Speaker 2>He's all shave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like</v>

1217
01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.500
<v Speaker 1>so young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a suite.</v>

1218
01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.440
<v Speaker 1>They styled him to be like this sweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

1219
01:02:56.441 --> 01:02:58.120
<v Speaker 1>a Christian boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1220
01:02:58.450 --> 01:02:59.283
<v Speaker 1>They tried to dress style him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're like this guy could never be </v>

1221
01:03:01.691 --> 01:03:02.524
<v Speaker 1>considered to be a predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's too sweet and good and too good of </v>

1222
01:03:05.441 --> 01:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>a good Christian old boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1223
01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1224
01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.753
<v Speaker 1>Bearded Elliott on the other hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely could never have hosted that </v>

1225
01:03:12.971 --> 01:03:13.804
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>

1226
01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I mention the most fucked up part of</v>

1227
01:03:19.781 --> 01:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>this is it they're having her meet him </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a</v>

1228
01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:26.460
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's either this guy is fucking good.</v>

1229
01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:28.260
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is pretty,</v>

1230
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 2>pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1231
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.340
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to respond?</v>

1232
01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.630
<v Speaker 2>A probably very stoically Joe and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>

1233
01:03:35.631 --> 01:03:36.464
<v Speaker 2>a dry sense of humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that conveys authenticity but </v>

1234
01:03:39.031 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 2>it's also brand appropriate and most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1235
01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:45.870
<v Speaker 2>most importantly tantamount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will not embarrass myself.</v>

1236
01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:53.893
<v Speaker 2>Very reminiscent of Gamer goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the best way to respond to </v>

1237
01:03:57.081 --> 01:03:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Internet ridicule?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what I found.</v>

1238
01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>revenge.</v>

1239
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1240
01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't want to get political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an option,</v>

1241
01:04:03.471 --> 01:04:04.304
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1242
01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.133
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>

1243
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it looks like you kind of have</v>

1244
01:04:11.071 --> 01:04:13.860
<v Speaker 2>a double chance and maybe work on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean I only met him that one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very sweet,</v>

1260
01:04:49.571 --> 01:04:50.404
<v Speaker 1>very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very happy to share the stage with the </v>

1261
01:04:52.091 --> 01:04:53.430
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1262
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish him all the very,</v>

1263
01:04:55.031 --> 01:04:56.200
<v Speaker 1>very best.</v>

1264
01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.250
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

1265
01:04:59.251 --> 01:05:00.890
<v Speaker 1>I have some questions for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

1266
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should have a call cause one </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>

1267
01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:04.943
<v Speaker 1>was that his clothes or did they make </v>
<v Speaker 1>him wear that shirt with a zipper on it </v>

1268
01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.810
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering how much was stage.</v>

1269
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid to ask though because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1270
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid to find out it was all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1271
01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I must don't want to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we can't even tell you.</v>

1272
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>That's curious and there's probably an </v>
<v Speaker 1>NDA.</v>

1273
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>TLC doesn't fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1274
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

1275
01:05:30.281 --> 01:05:31.114
<v Speaker 1>this goes back to thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that little girl in </v>

1276
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>those parents or can be that good of </v>
<v Speaker 1>actors to convincingly act that,</v>

1277
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.330
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1278
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:40.243
<v Speaker 1>the parents were okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the girl would convince me that </v>

1279
01:05:45.221 --> 01:05:47.680
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she was acting,</v>

1280
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>she's got a bright future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1281
01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:51.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then that's also what I wonder is </v>

1282
01:05:53.531 --> 01:05:57.370
<v Speaker 1>like if they're that good and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be actors,</v>

1283
01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 1>why don't we see these people in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you don't?</v>

1284
01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conclusion.</v>

1285
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.793
<v Speaker 1>TLC is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shout out to the valley folk out there </v>

1286
01:06:10.671 --> 01:06:13.260
<v Speaker 1>and God bless.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How's everyone doing today?</v>

1288
01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Let me check the calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone here?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys know what a fat burger is </v>

1366
01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.800
<v Speaker 1>either on my whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately I do.</v>

1367
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:56.343
<v Speaker 1>So we've had an ongoing debate about </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby wipes here on the show and I love </v>

1368
01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:03.350
<v Speaker 1>baby wipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge proponent of baby wipes one.</v>

1369
01:11:03.351 --> 01:11:04.184
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately this kind of started </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeping into my reality that flushable </v>

1370
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:12.160
<v Speaker 1>is misleading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1371
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Extremely misleading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This here on during the podcast,</v>

1372
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.680
<v Speaker 1>it's been a hard truth to swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1373
01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Ethan,</v>

1374
01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I want you to know those are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>flushable.</v>

1375
01:11:22.021 --> 01:11:22.590
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1376
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:23.423
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like suck my tiny Jewish dick and </v>

1377
01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I have stopped flashing them by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't,</v>

1378
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.510
<v Speaker 1>well I think that,</v>

1379
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:32.833
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

1380
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:36.710
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an anecdote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this morning I went white.</v>

1381
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:37.603
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of shit on it cause I </v>

1382
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.740
<v Speaker 1>got to do more dry them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it seemed fine.</v>

1383
01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.840
<v Speaker 1>It seemed ready to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't,</v>

1384
01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.340
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like when you go wet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is probably generally,</v>

1385
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:55.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less what's going on with this mic.</v>

1386
01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:58.670
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like all over the place.</v>

1387
01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1388
01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.460
<v Speaker 1>when you wipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go wet,</v>

1389
01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling that's nicer maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I go wet,</v>

1390
01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:14.450
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you don't want that,</v>

1391
01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:15.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna see,</v>

1392
01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:19.280
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want a shit covered wet </v>
<v Speaker 1>wipe of mine and the Trashcan,</v>

1393
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you have your own trashcan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

1394
01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:24.250
<v Speaker 1>you'll smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think so.</v>

1395
01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.270
<v Speaker 1>We have separate bathrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1396
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:32.453
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so apparently there's a phenomenon of </v>

1397
01:12:36.241 --> 01:12:41.241
<v Speaker 1>people flushing what wet wipes of raw </v>
<v Speaker 1>sewage flushable quote unquote flushable</v>

1398
01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:47.691
<v Speaker 1>wipes and hair turning into such a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>cluster of,</v>

1399
01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:54.570
<v Speaker 1>of shit that it's actually clogging huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>city main pipelines.</v>

1400
01:12:55.140 --> 01:13:00.120
<v Speaker 1>So the danger is actually not to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>home pipes,</v>

1401
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:04.230
<v Speaker 1>but the danger is to the city pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>

1402
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:05.543
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the city is spending millions of </v>

1403
01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:11.970
<v Speaker 1>dollars to take out these proverbial fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>burns.</v>

1404
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
<v Speaker 1>They're called that I'll share with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>here today,</v>

1405
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:16.770
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1406
01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:18.083
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1407
01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:21.593
<v Speaker 8>mmm.</v>

1408
01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris had the perfect rebuttal to when I</v>

1409
01:13:25.581 --> 01:13:26.061
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1410
01:13:26.061 --> 01:13:28.160
<v Speaker 1>some people flush the baby wipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1411
01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their shit on them.</v>

1412
01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:31.970

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1413
01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:33.433
<v Speaker 1>there's shit on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just take a shit in the </v>

1414
01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:36.510
<v Speaker 1>trashcan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1415
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:37.363
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you open it up and show feels</v>
<v Speaker 1>law savoring the moment here developing </v>

1416
01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.540
<v Speaker 1>on developing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Charleston water,</v>

1417
01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:49.570
<v Speaker 1>these guys have been on a tear lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the Charleston water system.</v>

1418
01:13:49.731 --> 01:13:52.700
<v Speaker 1>These guys are killing it on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>verified and everything.</v>

1419
01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:54.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been doing psa is about these </v>

1420
01:13:56.991 --> 01:13:59.780
<v Speaker 1>fucking Fatberg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here you go.</v>

1421
01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Diverse swim these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a hero.</v>

1422
01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Forget about a mascot in a burrito </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting punched.</v>

1423
01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:08.540
<v Speaker 1>That's not courage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a hero.</v>

1424
01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:09.950
<v Speaker 1>A hero is a die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1425
01:14:09.951 --> 01:14:11.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going quantify courage,</v>

1426
01:14:11.951 --> 01:14:12.784
<v Speaker 1>but diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swim through 90 feet of raw sewage to </v>

1427
01:14:16.961 --> 01:14:17.794
<v Speaker 1>unclog giant hairy Fatberg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you fucking imagine you're diving </v>

1428
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.950
<v Speaker 1>through raw sewage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

1429
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I can't see this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that?</v>

1430
01:14:29.891 --> 01:14:30.724
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks like something from a scary </v>

1431
01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:35.440
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like an,</v>

1432
01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>like a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of looks like my profile.</v>

1433
01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:41.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1434
01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Ken Hair.</v>

1435
01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:45.813
<v Speaker 1>So this is just shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it intriguing that sewage turns </v>

1436
01:14:48.611 --> 01:14:52.210
<v Speaker 1>black cause shit is brown obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we all know.</v>

1437
01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:56.560
<v Speaker 1>What interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to take a bite of that?</v>

1438
01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:58.380
<v Speaker 1>What'd you take a bite of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much should they go about it?</v>

1439
01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:03.390
<v Speaker 1>That I can barely look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just on the computer.</v>

1440
01:15:03.431 --> 01:15:07.480
<v Speaker 1>It's spaghetti to marinaded spaghetti </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

1441
01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awful.</v>

1442
01:15:08.321 --> 01:15:09.154
<v Speaker 1>It is awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I stand corrected on the issue of </v>

1443
01:15:11.141 --> 01:15:13.150
<v Speaker 1>flushable baby wipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1444
01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:14.043
<v Speaker 1>I find it pretty wack that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertise it as flushable when it's </v>

1445
01:15:19.211 --> 01:15:23.720
<v Speaker 1>clearly a completely not flushable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1446
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Like literally not flushable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that legal?</v>

1447
01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:30.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it to really be the fault of </v>

1448
01:15:32.681 --> 01:15:33.514
<v Speaker 1>these manufacturers that they're able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away with this deceptive marketing </v>

1449
01:15:37.541 --> 01:15:38.960
<v Speaker 1>because when I buy a flushed and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

1450
01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:42.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole market for flushable </v>
<v Speaker 1>wipes.</v>

1451
01:15:42.701 --> 01:15:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming that this is somehow,</v>

1452
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:47.390
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1453
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:49.610
<v Speaker 1>a valid statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1454
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:51.730
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe,</v>

1455
01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.593
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that to be some kind of false </v>

1456
01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.540
<v Speaker 1>advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1457
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:56.443
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much more Fatberg they're </v>

1458
01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.930
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look at,</v>

1461
01:16:12.041 --> 01:16:12.874
<v Speaker 1>this is the brave fuck that goes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>dives and still raw sewage and wonder </v>

1462
01:16:16.001 --> 01:16:19.990
<v Speaker 1>what those guys get paid man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot Picture.</v>

1463
01:16:20.210 --> 01:16:20.951
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like that's a whole,</v>

1465
01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:28.080
<v Speaker 1>it looks like this crazy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not even wearing protection.</v>

1466
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:30.120
<v Speaker 1>His sleeves are out.</v>

1467
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:31.463
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1468
01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:37.290
<v Speaker 1>He's proposing with the Fab Berg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his arms are exposed,</v>

1469
01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:43.870
<v Speaker 1>his face is exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's courage.</v>

1470
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:50.860
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty to that guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1471
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:53.320
<v Speaker 1>this is like a crazy operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then look good.</v>

1472
01:16:53.321 --> 01:16:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I look at all the work they do too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They says,</v>

1473
01:16:55.931 --> 01:16:59.260
<v Speaker 1>do you use flushable wipes in your home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns out they're not so flushable after</v>

1474
01:16:59.261 --> 01:17:00.071
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1475
01:17:00.071 --> 01:17:04.300
<v Speaker 1>they just caused a major citywide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a water pump clog and Charleston,</v>

1476
01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Charleston water says is becoming a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue for them too.</v>

1477
01:17:08.441 --> 01:17:11.690
<v Speaker 1>We break it down tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1478
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:13.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole investigation going on.</v>

1479
01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1480
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:20.910
<v Speaker 1>so what are you going to do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to get some bad days.</v>

1481
01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to get the days </v>
<v Speaker 1>installed.</v>

1482
01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I really liked these photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are these crazy ones.</v>

1483
01:17:26.791 --> 01:17:30.570
<v Speaker 1>We tried it when we were in Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had diarrhea.</v>

1484
01:17:30.571 --> 01:17:32.130
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I talked about this,</v>

1485
01:17:32.131 --> 01:17:32.964
<v Speaker 1>I have like really crazy diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my asshole was super sore from </v>

1486
01:17:36.421 --> 01:17:40.490
<v Speaker 1>wiping so vigorously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I shot the water,</v>

1487
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:41.343
<v Speaker 1>my asshole to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I'd look open wounds so I didn't </v>

1488
01:17:44.701 --> 01:17:47.040
<v Speaker 1>get to enjoy it that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I,</v>

1489
01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.870
<v Speaker 1>cause it's like a communal toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a fan setting.</v>

1490
01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:54.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1491
01:17:54.271 --> 01:17:55.680
<v Speaker 1>it has a dryer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1492
01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:57.180
<v Speaker 1>it has a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you sit on it,</v>

1493
01:17:57.190 --> 01:18:01.920
<v Speaker 1>it's sucks in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sucks the shit smell out of there.</v>

1494
01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I swear to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to you right now and then,</v>

1495
01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.910
<v Speaker 1>but the weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's sprays your asshole.</v>

1496
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:12.700
<v Speaker 1>And then the problem that I had with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly speaking,</v>

1497
01:18:12.701 --> 01:18:14.170
<v Speaker 1>because everyone talks about these big </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

1498
01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.520
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1499
01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:19.110
<v Speaker 1>heaven sent and this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I fear what happened,</v>

1500
01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:19.944
<v Speaker 1>but water dripped down my balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shitty water was dripping down my balls </v>

1501
01:18:23.431 --> 01:18:24.450
<v Speaker 1>for for fuck sake.</v>

1502
01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:25.513
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1503
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Torn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably need to learn how to use it.</v>

1504
01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:29.443
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I avoid water shooting down my </v>

1505
01:18:30.921 --> 01:18:33.530
<v Speaker 1>ball and take some learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1506
01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the weird one for me,</v>

1507
01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:39.230
<v Speaker 1>because this isn't a hotel so this has </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a lot of people shit.</v>

1508
01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seat was warm.</v>

1509
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Love that the seat comes up when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach it.</v>

1510
01:18:44.961 --> 01:18:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then they have a dryer setting cause</v>

1511
01:18:48.351 --> 01:18:49.184
<v Speaker 1>they know that your balls are all wet </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your asshole and everything's all </v>

1512
01:18:50.721 --> 01:18:51.554
<v Speaker 1>wet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the dryer smelled like it was </v>

1513
01:18:54.141 --> 01:18:55.270
<v Speaker 1>blowing shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaron,</v>

1514
01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.300
<v Speaker 1>my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds gross and like not,</v>

1515
01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:00.870
<v Speaker 1>why did you have your face in the toilet</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl?</v>

1516
01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't damn it smelled like I needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1517
01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I needed some fresh squirt water on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

1518
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a little pick me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But though,</v>

1519
01:19:14.911 --> 01:19:15.744
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't like my shit smell though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like this shit smell of like </v>

1520
01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.400
<v Speaker 1>thousands before me.</v>

1521
01:19:21.610 --> 01:19:22.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1522
01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:24.900
<v Speaker 1>In that hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's billowing like shitty air.</v>

1523
01:19:24.901 --> 01:19:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Like Fatberg air goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I think I'm going to go the </v>

1525
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:34.663
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we are responsible probably </v>

1526
01:19:36.811 --> 01:19:37.644
<v Speaker 1>for telling a lot of people to use baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>wipes brought with the amount of baby </v>

1527
01:19:40.701 --> 01:19:41.401
<v Speaker 1>wipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flush.</v>

1528
01:19:41.401 --> 01:19:42.234
<v Speaker 1>I'm personally responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroying the septic system ups of all </v>

1529
01:19:44.881 --> 01:19:45.714
<v Speaker 1>of Israel and Los Angeles and New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I take it back and say that I do not </v>

1530
01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:53.003
<v Speaker 1>use them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're moving the endorsement of </v>

1531
01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:57.210
<v Speaker 1>flushable so called flushable baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>wipes.</v>

1532
01:19:57.810 --> 01:19:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1533
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.200

<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to go the bid day rope</v>

1534
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:07.230
<v Speaker 1>the toe toes to try it.</v>

1535
01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the thing that I always,</v>

1536
01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:13.920
<v Speaker 3>I love this thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the King of England.</v>

1537
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.100
<v Speaker 3>How did he wipe his ass?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1538
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.433
<v Speaker 3>Like back in the day when the king was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like God and he's got like literally </v>

1539
01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:28.410
<v Speaker 3>gold woven dresses that he like lifts up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shits,</v>

1540
01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.260
<v Speaker 3>does someone wipe his ass?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1541
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:35.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that king gods gods,</v>

1542
01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:37.290
<v Speaker 3>what'd you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Queen does?</v>

1543
01:20:37.450 --> 01:20:38.283
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>There are more modern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's more modern.</v>

1545
01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:45.410
<v Speaker 3>She hasn't felt though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1546
01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.610
<v Speaker 3>but I'm taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is pre toto.</v>

1547
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:51.330
<v Speaker 3>This is pre modernity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is God's spokesman.</v>

1548
01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.373
<v Speaker 3>This is the clue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This has god basically the King of </v>

1549
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:58.230
<v Speaker 3>England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think he wipes his own ass?</v>

1550
01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.460
<v Speaker 3>We're all human after all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not King George.</v>

1551
01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:04.043
<v Speaker 3>I bet you he had peasants like I bet you</v>
<v Speaker 3>he laid on his back and some servant </v>

1552
01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.560
<v Speaker 3>fucking cleaned his asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1553
01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.220
<v Speaker 3>I bet you there's a history historian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows.</v>

1554
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:15.781
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>

1555
01:21:15.781 --> 01:21:17.310
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fucking google searches.</v>

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Did King George wipe his own?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drop the link.</v>

<v Speaker 3>there too.</v>

1558
01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Although I'm not talking specifically </v>
<v Speaker 3>the King of England.</v>

1559
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Why did medieval kings have servants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>wipe their butt for them?</v>

1560
01:21:30.631 --> 01:21:31.464
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't they just do it themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is this guy act like he knows for </v>

1561
01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:39.240
<v Speaker 3>top answers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes you think they'd dig?</v>

1562
01:21:39.241 --> 01:21:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Can you give me a source in this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard of it.</v>

01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1564
01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:48.230
<v Speaker 1>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the kind of history that we need</v>

1565
01:21:48.231 --> 01:21:50.600
<v Speaker 1>to learn about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

1566
01:21:50.601 --> 01:21:53.840
<v Speaker 1>what did you drop me here and all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did now see,</v>

1567
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this illustration is ill.</v>

1568
01:21:57.650 --> 01:21:58.483
<v Speaker 1>It was mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is this safe to show since you're </v>

1569
01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:03.570
<v Speaker 1>writing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1570
01:22:03.571 --> 01:22:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shit,</v>

1571
01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:09.090
<v Speaker 1>but this is not the king of England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand?</v>

1572
01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Look at her as a fine upper class woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1573
01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Is She paying in a bowl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think so.</v>

1574
01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you did it.</v>

1575
01:22:17.671 --> 01:22:20.370
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's come a long way.</v>

1576
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:21.263
<v Speaker 1>I love how on one hand they're like so </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the top with how they dress and </v>

1577
01:22:25.351 --> 01:22:26.184
<v Speaker 1>behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the other hand she's paying </v>

1578
01:22:27.231 --> 01:22:29.430
<v Speaker 1>in a bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1579
01:22:30.230 --> 01:22:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling that King George of,</v>

1580
01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.720
<v Speaker 1>of England at the height of his power </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't wipe his own ass.</v>

1581

<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medieval king.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and then she slept with Logan Paul.</v>

01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we made a mistake.</v>

1603
01:23:45.421 --> 01:23:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell anybody that we slept </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1604
01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Logan's response was the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's hear it.</v>

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:56.463
<v Speaker 3>We just go to a club like we normally </v>
<v Speaker 3>would do and just hung out and then </v>

1606
01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:03.520
<v Speaker 3>crank and it was just a bad decision and</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

1613
01:24:27.101 --> 01:24:28.370

<v Speaker 1>please don't tell anyone.</v>

1614
01:24:28.371 --> 01:24:29.111

<v Speaker 1>hours total,</v>

<v Speaker 1>suggestions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>

1678
01:27:52.061 --> 01:27:53.950
<v Speaker 1>something you want us to talk about or </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>

1679
01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:58.900
<v Speaker 1>email </v>
<v Speaker 1>us@podcastaththreehthreeproductions.com</v>

1680
01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:03.250
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our first question comes from Nada</v>

1681
01:28:05.130 --> 01:28:05.963
<v Speaker 1>either on a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that long ago you mentioned one of </v>

1682
01:28:08.071 --> 01:28:08.904
<v Speaker 1>your old videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shake that Dick and quickly shoved the </v>

1683
01:28:10.291 --> 01:28:11.124
<v Speaker 1>topic away in embarrassment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've even removed the video from the </v>

1684
01:28:12.601 --> 01:28:13.434
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which further perpetuates the idea that </v>

1685
01:28:14.881 --> 01:28:15.714
<v Speaker 1>you are ashamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I believe that it was one of the </v>

1686
01:28:17.101 --> 01:28:17.934
<v Speaker 1>funniest things you ever made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you should react to it and </v>

1687
01:28:19.891 --> 01:28:20.724
<v Speaker 1>tell us how you came about making it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you convinced eight people to cheer </v>

1688
01:28:24.061 --> 01:28:26.320
<v Speaker 1>you on as you shook your Dick for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1689
01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Have a blessed day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for that.</v>

1690
01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's embarrassing.</v>

1691
01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like my deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you see my deck.</v>

1692
01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:36.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like the whole outline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's every,</v>

1693
01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:37.373
<v Speaker 1>it's very embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like maybe it's a good </v>

1694
01:28:39.461 --> 01:28:41.800
<v Speaker 1>suggestion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we shouldn't make a video.</v>

1695
01:28:42.370 --> 01:28:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If an like an h three video because that</v>

1696
01:28:45.341 --> 01:28:48.530
<v Speaker 1>is the one video that my dad saw us.</v>

1697
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:50.330
<v Speaker 1>The good story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this,</v>

1698
01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:51.993
<v Speaker 1>I got this stone for that video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the last video I shared on my </v>

1699
01:28:55.631 --> 01:28:58.940
<v Speaker 1>facebook page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lore behind that video,</v>

1700
01:28:58.941 --> 01:28:59.774
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if anything can make a good age </v>

1701
01:29:02.101 --> 01:29:04.170
<v Speaker 1>three video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like is it,</v>

1702
01:29:04.290 --> 01:29:05.820
<v Speaker 1>am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it appropriate?</v>

1703
01:29:05.821 --> 01:29:10.821
<v Speaker 1>Can we show that footage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's like the outline of my Dick</v>

1704
01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Underpants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1705
01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.213
<v Speaker 1>You think that's fine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't actually see how you </v>

1706
01:29:15.331 --> 01:29:18.000
<v Speaker 1>don't see my deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1707
01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you can see like titties,</v>

1708
01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.730
<v Speaker 1>like you could see like a tit outline </v>
<v Speaker 1>under a shirt and that's fine.</v>

1709
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:26.850
<v Speaker 1>That was the whole joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1710
01:29:26.851 --> 01:29:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Where's the Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the teddies you get to ask,</v>

1711
01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:34.290
<v Speaker 1>where's the deck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll think about it.</v>

1712
01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Not a,</v>

1713
01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:35.730
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1714
01:29:36.150 --> 01:29:38.430
<v Speaker 5>how did we convince those people on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>street?</v>

1715
01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.670
<v Speaker 5>Those were real people sitting on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>street and we were just like,</v>

1716
01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:42.893
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you guys mind getting a little like </v>

1717
01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:46.230
<v Speaker 5>excited for us?</v>

1718
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:47.263
<v Speaker 1>The video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's talking about the party at </v>

1719
01:29:49.071 --> 01:29:49.904
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>

1720
01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:51.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought of</v>

1721
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:55.750
<v Speaker 1>the old dude actor ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll save it.</v>

1722
01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:58.420
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's enough floor behind that</v>

1723
01:29:58.421 --> 01:30:01.150
<v Speaker 1>to make an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one comes from Marv.</v>

1724
01:30:01.151 --> 01:30:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those people were my friends.</v>

1725
01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>

1726
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:05.623
<v Speaker 1>Well those are my art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus they were well aware with our </v>

1727
01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:14.290
<v Speaker 1>antics by then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marv.</v>

1728
01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ashamed to admit it,</v>

1729
01:30:16.541 --> 01:30:18.760
<v Speaker 1>but I'm one of those people that eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>buggers.</v>

1730
01:30:19.690 --> 01:30:21.850
<v Speaker 1>It's been a habit of mine for as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can think.</v>

1731
01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:22.713
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat burgers probably once or twice </v>
<v Speaker 1>a day less if I'm a lot of people and </v>

1732
01:30:26.321 --> 01:30:29.920
<v Speaker 1>more if I'm alone and board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got good at hiding it from people.</v>

1733
01:30:29.921 --> 01:30:33.460
<v Speaker 1>He's like an alcoholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hide my alcohol around the house.</v>

1734
01:30:34.450 --> 01:30:35.283
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he at wonderful put a booger</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the table and then when people </v>

1735
01:30:37.451 --> 01:30:41.320
<v Speaker 1>leave he takes it off and eats just </v>
<v Speaker 1>dance.</v>

1736
01:30:42.190 --> 01:30:43.840
<v Speaker 1>While I'm trying to help the guy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>hobby,</v>

1737
01:30:46.630 --> 01:30:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I got good at hiding it from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even for my girlfriend of five years,</v>

1738
01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.830
<v Speaker 1>she's as she never knew as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1739
01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:56.950
<v Speaker 1>even though I know it is disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel disgusted.</v>

1740
01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.650
<v Speaker 1>It's weird and I'm more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1741
01:30:59.770 --> 01:31:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm more disgusted with myself that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep doing it.</v>

1742
01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:04.233
<v Speaker 1>It's an urge that is hard to suppress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like at least I do it less </v>

1743
01:31:07.871 --> 01:31:08.704
<v Speaker 1>than I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to use other methods of </v>

1744
01:31:10.271 --> 01:31:12.970
<v Speaker 1>disposing of boogers if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>available and convenient,</v>

1745
01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:15.490
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like too,</v>

1746
01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:16.990
<v Speaker 1>this is intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1747
01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:18.713
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bit more hesitant to do it if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know I breathed through some weird </v>

1748
01:31:21.491 --> 01:31:22.324
<v Speaker 1>chemicals or dust with my nose since I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe bookers are there to catch </v>

1749
01:31:25.001 --> 01:31:27.520
<v Speaker 1>particles to prevent it from getting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your lungs.</v>

1750
01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:32.640
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes I'll still even do it then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not much of a taste to booger if</v>

1751
01:31:33.701 --> 01:31:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm being honest or at least not that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can describe.</v>

1752
01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:37.023
<v Speaker 1>There are different textures though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mainly how hard and soft there and some </v>

1753
01:31:40.541 --> 01:31:45.250
<v Speaker 1>are more juicy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably sick and disgusting now,</v>

1754
01:31:45.251 --> 01:31:46.960
<v Speaker 1>but as I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

1755
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:49.090
<v Speaker 1>There's not much more to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:54.453
<v Speaker 1>your bravery and your honesty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharing this anecdote because it's </v>

1760
01:31:56.891 --> 01:31:57.724
<v Speaker 1>important to know that they are out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and it's important and it's nice </v>

1761
01:32:00.221 --> 01:32:01.054
<v Speaker 1>to get in your mind and kind of see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love some of the little details of </v>

1762
01:32:05.231 --> 01:32:06.064
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if I'm around chemicals I'll </v>

1763
01:32:07.871 --> 01:32:08.704
<v Speaker 1>not eat my boogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes I'll still eat them or </v>

1764
01:32:13.001 --> 01:32:18.001
<v Speaker 1>like I'll hide it from my girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I fucking hate buggers off as snarly</v>

1765
01:32:18.821 --> 01:32:20.140
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually,</v>

1766
01:32:20.170 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to shame my booger eating,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and family members out there or </v>

<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And you'll have never farted on your </v>

1771
01:32:35.701 --> 01:32:37.770
<v Speaker 1>hand and smelled it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always say it as a joke because they</v>

1772
01:32:37.771 --> 01:32:39.450
<v Speaker 1>actually do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have done it.</v>

1773
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1774
01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:42.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not something I regularly do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've done it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>because it smells deck bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know you fargo on your hand and </v>

<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1786
01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:09.960
<v Speaker 1>How can you not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you Zach.</v>

1787

1788
01:33:12.481 --> 01:33:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Shitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>

1789
01:33:14.641 --> 01:33:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Sheeko have you farted on your hands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smelled it.</v>

1790
01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.060
<v Speaker 1>He's he's on a call.</v>

<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1792
01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:23.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe Zach?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would not lie about that?</v>

1793
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:26.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1794
01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Zach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you being truthful?</v>

1795
01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe him.</v>

1796
01:33:29.441 --> 01:33:30.770
<v Speaker 1>This is a familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a guide.</v>

1797
01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankly.</v>

1798
01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1799
01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you need to do that?</v>

1800
01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.270
<v Speaker 1>What's the motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you want,</v>

1801
01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:44.620
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to know that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stronger cause a stronger smell.</v>

1802
01:33:44.850 --> 01:33:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't factor in it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done it in a while,</v>

1803
01:33:48.821 --> 01:33:49.654
<v Speaker 1>but to sit here and tell me you've never</v>
<v Speaker 1>butter if copped yourself fucking </v>

1804
01:33:52.661 --> 01:33:57.640
<v Speaker 1>outrage and ally far and you buttercup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never done it.</v>

1805
01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Buy It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what else have you lied to me about?</v>

1806
01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this guy who eats his boogers?</v>

1807
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Incidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a serendipitously,</v>

1808
01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I saw this article that eating buggers </v>
<v Speaker 1>may boost in unity.</v>

1809
01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:20.820
<v Speaker 1>So there is a biological explanation for</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you people who are shoveling buggers</v>

1810
01:34:21.311 --> 01:34:23.620
<v Speaker 1>into your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eating boogers may boost immunity.</v>

1811
01:34:23.650 --> 01:34:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Scientist suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to bother to read it,</v>

1812
01:34:25.751 --> 01:34:26.584
<v Speaker 1>but you get the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at this little booger </v>

1813
01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:29.523
<v Speaker 1>picker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all that means is that they're </v>

1814
01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:34.180
<v Speaker 1>full of germs and you're just eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>germs right?</v>

1815
01:34:34.181 --> 01:34:35.014
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1816
01:34:35.150 --> 01:34:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Den.</v>

1817
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:37.343
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1818
01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:41.310
<v Speaker 1>so eat your boogers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you.</v>

1819
01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:44.640
<v Speaker 1>From Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

1820
01:34:44.641 --> 01:34:45.474
<v Speaker 1>Ethan and Eli was listening on podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>88 and you all brought up the idea of </v>

1821
01:34:47.911 --> 01:34:50.070
<v Speaker 1>enjoying the act of smelling your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>farts.</v>

1822
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I would like to weigh in on this debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you know that I'm with Ethan on</v>

1823
01:34:53.431 --> 01:34:54.264
<v Speaker 1>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was against him on his wiping </v>

1824
01:34:56.041 --> 01:34:57.890
<v Speaker 1>technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is common ground.</v>

1825
01:34:57.891 --> 01:34:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad we found some common ground.</v>

1826
01:34:59.541 --> 01:35:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Then I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the liking,</v>

1827
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:04.723
<v Speaker 1>smelling I liking your own farm is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological thing because animals </v>

1828
01:35:08.961 --> 01:35:11.120
<v Speaker 1>naturally try to smell their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

1829
01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:12.253
<v Speaker 1>So your own bodily smells will smell </v>
<v Speaker 1>better you than they would have someone </v>

1830
01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:17.030
<v Speaker 1>else's because it indicates it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>their territory.</v>

1831
01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I think that enjoying your farts is </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally normal and human nature.</v>

1832
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.823
<v Speaker 1>I would even go as far as to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of us hotbox our cars with farts </v>

1833
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:26.750
<v Speaker 1>and secretly enjoy it.</v>

1834
01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.633
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes on to say you are my favorite </v>

1835
01:35:30.711 --> 01:35:33.950
<v Speaker 1>content creators on Youtube and Papa </v>
<v Speaker 1>Blas.</v>

1836
01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank you ben for corroborating.</v>

1837
01:35:37.851 --> 01:35:40.490
<v Speaker 1>What I've always said is that isla is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>liar.</v>

1838
01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Prolific Liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1839
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:44.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sheeko still on the phone?</v>

1840
01:35:46.110 --> 01:35:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could to see.</v>

1841
01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Can you ask him just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know if he's farts on his hand</v>

1842
01:35:51.051 --> 01:35:54.110
<v Speaker 1>and smells it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he does?</v>

1843
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you find on your own hand and smell </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

1844
01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Ethan wants to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never ever.</v>

1845
01:35:59.151 --> 01:36:02.330
<v Speaker 1>He says shaking his head because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives are reasonable person.</v>

1846
01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Give me a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a 50 50 kind of thing.</v>

1847
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:11.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do a poll and do a poll.</v>

1848
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go first.</v>

1849
01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Well to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1850
01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Should we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a lot.</v>

1851
01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:19.633
<v Speaker 1>Should we say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you like the smell of your own farts </v>

1852
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:22.303
<v Speaker 1>or no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you're talking is very different </v>

1853
01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:28.410
<v Speaker 1>to during the school cause you admit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>liking the smell of your own farm?</v>

1854
01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:31.553
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you tolerate the smell of your own </v>

1855
01:36:33.321 --> 01:36:34.340
<v Speaker 1>farm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1856
01:36:34.341 --> 01:36:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I still think it smells like farts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1857
01:36:37.710 --> 01:36:38.301
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1858
01:36:38.301 --> 01:36:38.631
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1859
01:36:38.631 --> 01:36:39.021
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1860
01:36:39.021 --> 01:36:39.854
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to go as far as to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that my own farts don't smell as bad to </v>

1861
01:36:43.161 --> 01:36:45.550
<v Speaker 1>me as they probably do to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go that far.</v>

1862
01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:48.850
<v Speaker 1>It does pull down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you fart you,</v>

1863
01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:51.050
<v Speaker 1>it bothers you the smell of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>farm.</v>

1864
01:36:52.130 --> 01:36:53.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll agree with what Dan said.</v>

1865
01:36:53.931 --> 01:36:58.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not as gross tolerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's tolerable to you as tall,</v>

1866
01:36:58.641 --> 01:37:01.200
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean I go out of my way</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well I don't think that was very fun at </v>

1901
01:38:25.191 --> 01:38:27.650
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is serious shit.</v>

1902
01:38:27.710 --> 01:38:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I year ago I being a lazy ass thick boy </v>
<v Speaker 1>chose to sit down and pee in my toilet.</v>

1903
01:38:33.291 --> 01:38:34.124
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been my preferred method of </v>

1904
01:38:35.601 --> 01:38:36.434
<v Speaker 1>urination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recently I saw Messi come forward and </v>

1905
01:38:38.781 --> 01:38:42.230
<v Speaker 1>mentioned that he does it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This gave me the courage to mention this</v>

1906
01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:43.093
<v Speaker 1>among my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all ridiculed me and made me even </v>

1907
01:38:45.141 --> 01:38:47.810
<v Speaker 1>question my decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy related question.</v>

1908
01:38:47.810 --> 01:38:49.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave it to us guys.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1910
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:56.480
<v Speaker 1>is it weird to pee sitting down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well again,</v>

1911
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:58.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to shame my fellow,</v>

1912
01:39:00.710 --> 01:39:03.500
<v Speaker 1>my fellow boys here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you eat your boogers,</v>

1913
01:39:04.190 --> 01:39:05.023
<v Speaker 1>if you pee sitting down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a kind of a beautiful testament </v>

1914
01:39:07.941 --> 01:39:11.660
<v Speaker 1>to how diverse we as human beings really</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

1915
01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Some of us far on their own hands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smell it,</v>

1916
01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:15.470
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I understand it,</v>

1917
01:39:15.471 --> 01:39:16.870
<v Speaker 1>very normal and courteous.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I like about people at </v>

2046
01:46:36.581 --> 01:46:37.414

<v Speaker 1>They are courageous and they are </v>

01:46:40.171 --> 01:46:41.004
<v Speaker 1>truthful.</v>

2048
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2049
01:46:44.410 --> 01:46:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I find it hard to believe that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like the smell of their own farts.</v>

2050
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2052
01:46:54.061 --> 01:46:54.894
<v Speaker 1>hard to believe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the gross smell because it's like </v>

2053
01:46:56.461 --> 01:46:59.840
<v Speaker 1>biological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you almost cannot deny it.</v>

2054
01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're willing to sit there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze the smell of your own heart,</v>

2055
01:47:02.851 --> 01:47:06.060
<v Speaker 1>which you admit to doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a sense you couldn't do that without</v>

2056
01:47:06.061 --> 01:47:09.930
<v Speaker 1>enjoying you put in and Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't do that without going good.</v>

2057
01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2058
01:47:10.951 --> 01:47:13.350
<v Speaker 1>You're not making any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2059
01:47:13.410 --> 01:47:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not analyzing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sitting there and thinking like</v>

2060
01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:18.203
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think all the time you're </v>

2061
01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:21.540
<v Speaker 1>thinking yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of far does that,</v>

2062
01:47:21.541 --> 01:47:22.820
<v Speaker 1>if you could just take a smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2063
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:25.560
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this is really growth.</v>
