<v Speaker 1>There was one or two people that was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shooting and thousand oaks that was</v>

<v Speaker 1>I do want to say yeah,</v>

34
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>my parents were evacuated from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

35
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>They were staying with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

36
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.074
<v Speaker 1>luckily not that close to the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was smokey and there was ash </v>

37
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really scary.</v>

38
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main freeway in La,</v>

39
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>the one on one was shut down.</v>

40
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

41
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>it was apocalyptic out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was wild.</v>

42
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just had the news on like the whole </v>

43
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.363
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't believe it because it was one </v>

45
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just everything's on fire.</v>

46
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't know if it's,</v>

47
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>it could spread over to where we live </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>

48
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 1>if the wind changes and it goes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong direction,</v>

49
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

50
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.633
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at a place for my parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a week ago in thousand oaks or it </v>

51
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>was a Westlake village is where was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>And just so we could go and it's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>really beautiful little community,</v>

53
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>the gated community and it's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woods,</v>

54
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>kind of in thousand oaks is like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature preserve.</v>

55
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:40.254
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the decks and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>trees coming out of the decks and all </v>

56
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>the trees are marked and it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>protected area.</v>

57
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>But I remember being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

58
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>this is pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

59
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.570
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a firewood ravage this place</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty easily.</v>

60
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I was telling my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was a week ago,</v>

61
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.710
<v Speaker 1>that whole place burned down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

62
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>the whole plate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole community burned down.</v>

63
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just,</v>

64
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.213
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a been a real tragic loss of </v>

65
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>life and property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

66
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I will talk about that more later </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of amazing footage</v>

67
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:18.634
<v Speaker 1>and stories that came out of that that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think is interesting and I'm crazy wild </v>

68
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:24.814
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

69
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>But before we get now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you guys can tell from the title,</v>

70
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.353
<v Speaker 1>we have got to address a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism that people have been saying </v>

71
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:34.774
<v Speaker 1>against me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are tuning in probably </v>

72
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>to enjoy an epic meltdown for me to wash</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

73
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>make a fool of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I'm here.</v>

74
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Dan doesn't usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

75
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.690
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

76
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I sleep through the episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

77
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>it has it on mute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I promise we will get to that.</v>

78
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to be fireworks guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a firewall.</v>

79
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.773
<v Speaker 1>But before we get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to do a goof for the day to </v>

80
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>kind of lighten it up a little bit here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What this vape God,</v>

81
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>the Fda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.853
<v Speaker 1>Tommy the vape God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow this epic troll got on Fox News </v>

83
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

84
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's speaking on behalf of the,</v>

85
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 1>how do you call those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn the jewels.</v>

86
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is these tiny little vape pen,</v>

87
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:23.824
<v Speaker 1>it's like a pocket vape pen that </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently like in middle school and </v>

88
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's hitting these jewels,</v>

89
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>which is so crazy to me because when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a kid smoking was already not cool.</v>

90
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:33.514
<v Speaker 1>There was a couple of people that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>went out in high school to smoke a </v>

91
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 1>cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now all of a sudden with vaping it's</v>

92
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:38.314
<v Speaker 1>like cool again and these kids are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting these jewels that like 16 years </v>

93
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:42.570
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

94
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.733
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy got on the news and it's just </v>

95
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 1>instant credit</v>

96
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.853
<v Speaker 2>installation specifically with regard to</v>
<v Speaker 2>flavored varietals that have helped </v>

97
00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:55.230
<v Speaker 2>propelled explosion in the use among the</v>
<v Speaker 2>young here.</v>

98
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:56.064
<v Speaker 2>Now to focus on very separate sides of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this issue that Schwab is Dr Tom Scott </v>

99
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Gabelli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a blogger at barstool sports.</v>

100
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Who affectionally goes by the name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tommy smokes.</v>

101
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.530
<v Speaker 2>So because of the videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I'm gonna try sick.</v>

102
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy rips that zone and know both.</v>

103
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.390
<v Speaker 3>When they give me those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they think,</v>

104
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.650
<v Speaker 3>I really think that Fox News always</v>

105
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.593
<v Speaker 1>does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they'll bring like I was watching </v>

106
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:36.050
<v Speaker 1>this video during the cabinet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing,</v>

107
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.540
<v Speaker 1>they brought on a guy who says he's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual,</v>

108
00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:39.374
<v Speaker 1>which that does incantations against him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like the most absurd looking </v>

109
00:05:45.321 --> 00:05:46.154
<v Speaker 1>person you can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they always bring on these </v>

110
00:05:47.631 --> 00:05:49.460
<v Speaker 1>people that you can't tell if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious or not,</v>

111
00:05:49.461 --> 00:05:51.350
<v Speaker 1>which are like the perfect punching band</v>
<v Speaker 1>to there.</v>

112
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.250
<v Speaker 1>So this guy is a apparently I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's taking him seriously,</v>

113
00:05:55.251 --> 00:05:57.360
<v Speaker 1>which is wild bird song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joel Kenya.</v>

114
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.700
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

115
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.673
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sell me on why these flavored e-cigs </v>

116
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.280
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be regulated even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

117
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.870
<v Speaker 2>when teens are using them and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasing numbers will look.</v>

118
00:06:09.871 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm 22 years old so I'm using them </v>
<v Speaker 2>legally and honestly they're just cool.</v>

119
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 2>They're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You rip them.</v>

120
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing cooler than blowing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat cloud.</v>

121
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's truly the Colossus of cloud.</v>

122
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 2>It helps my swag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps my drip.</v>

123
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I just love walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good for getting chicks too.</v>

124
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:27.464
<v Speaker 2>So honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started about a year ago and I know </v>

125
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 2>that I haven't looked back since I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a question.</v>

126
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

127
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 2>You use your cell phone quite a bit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

128
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

129
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 2>So why don't you rig it up to your phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that way you won't have like the,</v>

130
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.310
<v Speaker 2>the actual calories burned by grabbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>your phone so you can visit</v>

131
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.190
<v Speaker 1>what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She completely lost.</v>

132
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's it gone?</v>

133
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.733
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>devices.</v>

141
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.740
<v Speaker 2>The humor that.</v>

142
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.320

<v Speaker 1>seems like I'm throwing the.</v>

143
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.363
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

144
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.433
<v Speaker 1>The whole writing team came together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we decided you should vape betty or </v>

145
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:19.250
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't know if this goes anywhere,</v>

00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:30.680
<v Speaker 1>into the lion's den and he and he fought</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good fight.</v>

150
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>He held his own.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

154
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Isla didn't truly loved me until I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started blowing fat clouds interface.</v>

155
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.653
<v Speaker 1>So shout out to Tommy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get to the reason we are all here </v>

156
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:49.004
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

157
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking a lot about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me take a little sip of water here.</v>

158
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.823
<v Speaker 1>This is difficult for me to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's something I've been </v>

159
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:03.134
<v Speaker 1>thinking a lot about of late trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrap my head around it and think about </v>

160
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:08.294
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 1>honestly and critically and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with things in a healthier,</v>

162
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.900
<v Speaker 1>more mature way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of.</v>

163
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I have a long winded kind of story here </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I hope that will be interesting and</v>

164
00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:27.794
<v Speaker 1>maybe helpful for some people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it helps some people explain and </v>

165
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:36.331
<v Speaker 1>understand where I've been coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of criticism of me of</v>

166
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 1>late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

167
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

168
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of lots and lots of videos and,</v>

169
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:44.504
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a natural aversion to criticism </v>

170
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.293
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that I've been </v>

171
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:54.680
<v Speaker 1>learning about myself through therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've started recently.</v>

172
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.333
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

173
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 4>throughout my career I've.</v>

174
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me start from the top.</v>

175
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:04.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting ahead of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do people have been saying about me</v>

176
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 4>recently?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

177
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.653
<v Speaker 4>That I'm a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That I prioritize money over everything </v>

178
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I've thrown friends under the bus,</v>

179
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:15.114
<v Speaker 4>that I'm ignorant and poorly informed </v>
<v Speaker 4>and spread misinformation that I'm </v>

180
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:19.853
<v Speaker 4>arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I cannot handle criticism and that </v>

181
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 4>I've used to people just to name a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of the reoccurring themes.</v>

182
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's so much more you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>say about me.</v>

183
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.230
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and let me just say this,</v>

184
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:32.064
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the record that I am guilty of all </v>

185
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:40.071
<v Speaker 4>of those things and I'm not going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>quantify it or make excuses or anything.</v>

186
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 4>I've done those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am guilty of those things.</v>

187
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:47.980
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

188
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 4>and this is something that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>aware of myself over the past couple,</v>

189
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:52.703
<v Speaker 4>last two years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that I have been kind of slipping </v>

190
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:02.210
<v Speaker 4>into a very unhealthy place mentally and</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

191
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 4>I want to try to go through this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>make sense of it.</v>

192
00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:07.254
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's been kind of a slow moving </v>

193
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:13.590
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been like a self fulfilling process</v>

194
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:17.610
<v Speaker 4>in a way where it's gotten worse and </v>
<v Speaker 4>worse and I get criticized more and more</v>

195
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 4>and I get more defensive or more hold </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

196
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.870
<v Speaker 4>And I went and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

197
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:22.704
<v Speaker 4>early on in our youtube career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went very early on to somebody that </v>

198
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:28.854
<v Speaker 4>was universally liked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember in 2016 I could do no wrong </v>

199
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.563
<v Speaker 4>on youtube</v>

200
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.600
<v Speaker 4>and like on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on Reddit,</v>

201
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.570
<v Speaker 4>everybody loved us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were voted like Reddit,</v>

202
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.620
<v Speaker 4>reddit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube channel the year or something,</v>

203
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:48.430
<v Speaker 4>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like the concept of being criticized</v>

204
00:10:48.431 --> 00:10:49.264
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on that level was something I hadn't </v>

205
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.240
<v Speaker 4>dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

206
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.513
<v Speaker 4>and I think the problem was that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people had me very high on a pedestal </v>

207
00:10:58.151 --> 00:10:58.930
<v Speaker 4>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

208
00:10:58.930 --> 00:10:59.763
<v Speaker 4>people thought very highly of me and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no doubt that at the time it </v>

209
00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:07.111
<v Speaker 4>definitely started to go to my head as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well and I'm pretty sure,</v>

210
00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:08.134
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking back that I started to become </v>

211
00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:15.421
<v Speaker 4>more arrogant and overconfident and on </v>
<v Speaker 4>some probably deep unconscious level,</v>

212
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 4>a feeling of almost infallibility that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>could take anything on that.</v>

213
00:11:24.581 --> 00:11:25.930
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I had,</v>

214
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.550
<v Speaker 4>I had like this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really did.</v>

215
00:11:27.551 --> 00:11:30.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to come to terms with that and</v>

216
00:11:30.911 --> 00:11:35.050
<v Speaker 4>to confront that because at the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll never rationally be like,</v>

217
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.280
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

218
00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to tone it down.</v>

219
00:11:38.441 --> 00:11:39.274
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so because of this combination of </v>

220
00:11:42.071 --> 00:11:46.600
<v Speaker 4>like overconfidence and feeling like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could take everything on,</v>

221
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.610
<v Speaker 4>it led me to make a lot of mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when I was criticized for those</v>

222
00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 4>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I would act extremely</v>

223
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:59.490
<v Speaker 1>defensive and nasty and not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing them in a healthy way.</v>

224
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.343
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leafy thing was and the Wall Street </v>

225
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:07.623
<v Speaker 1>Journal thing and stuff like this where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of just handled things in a </v>

226
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.064
<v Speaker 1>really overconfidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really thinking that I can take on the </v>

227
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not and not do wrong.</v>

228
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And then when I ended up fucking up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>finds out,</v>

229
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 1>it comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when I get criticized,</v>

230
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I completely shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

231
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I have the cycle I'm learning now </v>
<v Speaker 1>through therapy,</v>

232
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 1>which I've just started doing about a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only been doing it for like a month</v>

233
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 1>or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a psychological,</v>

234
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>a problem where when I went for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason that I don't want to</v>

235
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:41.224
<v Speaker 1>get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the way I was raised is that when </v>

236
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm criticized,</v>

237
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:45.664
<v Speaker 1>I psychologically shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so before I became like famous on </v>

238
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a problem with criticism,</v>

239
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:57.160
<v Speaker 1>but it was so much less amplified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But kind of like when you become famous,</v>

240
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.630
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>

241
00:12:58.830 --> 00:12:59.663
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

242
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.770
<v Speaker 1>amplifies certain aspects of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of yourself.</v>

243
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.930
<v Speaker 1>And it definitely puts you through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gauntlet of sorts of kind of,</v>

244
00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:11.764
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

245
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.370
<v Speaker 1>learning about yourself on an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>level and brings out all your flaws,</v>

246
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.413
<v Speaker 1>amplifies everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that thing of not being able to </v>

247
00:13:23.131 --> 00:13:23.964
<v Speaker 1>handle criticism in my personal life was</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I could get by on my </v>

248
00:13:27.721 --> 00:13:29.310
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not really have any problems,</v>

249
00:13:29.311 --> 00:13:33.670
<v Speaker 1>but then when you have like hordes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the Internet criticizing Gill,</v>

250
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.733
<v Speaker 1>it can get so overwhelming that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually can cause for me like a real </v>

251
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:44.130
<v Speaker 1>psychological shutdown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which what I mean by that is like,</v>

252
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I just feel it feels to me so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it feels like somebody died.</v>

253
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:50.843
<v Speaker 1>Like I get so emotionally and so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result of that one is like I'm </v>

254
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.163
<v Speaker 1>extremely lethargic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'll just lay down on the carpet </v>

255
00:13:59.581 --> 00:14:00.361
<v Speaker 1>with like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

256
00:14:00.361 --> 00:14:01.194
<v Speaker 1>Well then the other thing is that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I get super defensive and </v>

257
00:14:05.701 --> 00:14:06.534
<v Speaker 1>super irritable and super aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards those that criticized me in a </v>

258
00:14:10.291 --> 00:14:11.730
<v Speaker 1>way that's not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

259
00:14:11.731 --> 00:14:16.731
<v Speaker 1>and instead of learning from criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deflecting it all the time and making it</v>

260
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.200
<v Speaker 1>the world's problem and not mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

261
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:21.783
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of where my head was </v>
<v Speaker 1>after these first blunders I made from </v>

262
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.070
<v Speaker 1>overconfidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

263
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And did you know things that I regret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it shattered my ego in a way.</v>

264
00:14:37.861 --> 00:14:42.630
<v Speaker 1>And a real fundamental way that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>also learned about myself is that I'm in</v>

265
00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:43.560
<v Speaker 1>my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

266
00:14:43.561 --> 00:14:46.050
<v Speaker 1>this is through pet therapy that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>really helpful for me,</v>

267
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.143
<v Speaker 1>is that I'm in my best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most creative place when I have that </v>

268
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:53.600
<v Speaker 1>confidence and that kind of,</v>

269
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.143
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

270
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.010
<v Speaker 1>not a place of a overconfidence or </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogance,</v>

271
00:14:59.011 --> 00:15:01.920
<v Speaker 1>but just feeling like that people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing,</v>

272
00:15:01.921 --> 00:15:04.770
<v Speaker 1>that I like what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it should be a wholesome,</v>

273
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.180
<v Speaker 1>great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that.</v>

274
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.153
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's one of the root </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with why I've had so much </v>

275
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.953
<v Speaker 1>trouble creating videos for such a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time is because I've kind of lost my </v>

276
00:15:14.191 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 1>footing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

277
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.173
<v Speaker 1>I've lost that wholesome place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everything became very difficult </v>

278
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having shattered my ego and never having</v>

279
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.340
<v Speaker 1>address that or deal with it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronted it.</v>

280
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.260
<v Speaker 1>And so what happened from that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it changed,</v>

281
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.153
<v Speaker 1>it set off a chain event of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of defensive behavior and caused me to </v>

282
00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:38.304
<v Speaker 1>be depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to make clear that I'm not </v>

283
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.250
<v Speaker 1>using depression as an excuse for acting</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty.</v>

284
00:15:44.251 --> 00:15:45.084
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not processing and handling </v>

285
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.740
<v Speaker 1>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was losing my confidence,</v>

286
00:15:52.741 --> 00:15:56.340
<v Speaker 1>my ego was shattered and therefore I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't make videos.</v>

287
00:15:56.341 --> 00:15:58.650
<v Speaker 1>And all this other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what caused the depression.</v>

288
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.360
<v Speaker 1>And so what happened now is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression actually made everything even</v>

289
00:16:03.361 --> 00:16:04.500
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

290
00:16:04.501 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 1>It made it even harder for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

291
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.320
<v Speaker 1>so it got worse and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get criticized more and more.</v>

292
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I get more and more defensive and closed</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

293
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.200
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

294
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.600
<v Speaker 1>I want to make clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.043
<v Speaker 1>I just kept shoving it all deep down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming more and more depressed </v>

296
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's only been,</v>

297
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently that I've been.</v>

298
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I've kind of hit rock bottom a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago where I was so amped up.</v>

299
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:42.284
<v Speaker 1>I was so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the depression that amplifies all my </v>

300
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:45.410
<v Speaker 1>negative feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

301
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.290
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what the problem was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

302
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and worst of all,</v>

303
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.980
<v Speaker 1>it made me extremely irritable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

304
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.150
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know,</v>

305
00:16:53.151 --> 00:16:55.520
<v Speaker 1>like irritable on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that level,</v>

306
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:56.893
<v Speaker 1>but it's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst because not only do you </v>

307
00:16:59.721 --> 00:17:00.554
<v Speaker 1>piss people off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you start to hate yourself to them </v>

308
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.200
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:17:06.201 --> 00:17:07.034
<v Speaker 1>you're acting irrationally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the emotion is so strong that it's </v>

310
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:11.630
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't be ignored.</v>

311
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Like just with Isla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

312
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:18.120
<v Speaker 1>at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like um,</v>

313
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.410
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times when I would get </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggravated or upset,</v>

314
00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:22.244
<v Speaker 1>I would direct my frustration towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>you even though it had nothing to do </v>

315
00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:28.000
<v Speaker 1>with you because I was so irritable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

316
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.873
<v Speaker 1>and I'm up to and in that moment I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's fucked up and I'm being an </v>

317
00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:32.354
<v Speaker 1>asshole and I hate myself so much for it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see that it's upsetting you and </v>

318
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:37.880
<v Speaker 1>then you get angry at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

319
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.870
<v Speaker 1>it's just this overwhelming Iraq</v>

320
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.590
<v Speaker 5>journal and I've even learned </v>
<v Speaker 5>irritability.</v>

321
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.023
<v Speaker 5>I would know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like you're not being </v>

322
00:17:45.271 --> 00:17:48.580
<v Speaker 5>yourself right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's such a cycle that I can.</v>

323
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 5>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't not get</v>

324
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.990
<v Speaker 1>upset because you're being worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

325
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 1>You being crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have every right to be upset and we</v>

326
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:57.640
<v Speaker 1>know that and then it's just such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle,</v>

327
00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get out of it.</v>

328
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.450
<v Speaker 1>So because of this crazy irritability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really.</v>

329
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:11.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm just making everything more </v>
<v Speaker 1>amplified.</v>

330
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I was reacting way too strongly and way </v>
<v Speaker 1>too negatively lead almost everything.</v>

331
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.513
<v Speaker 1>Even the slightest annoyance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would lash out at things and people </v>

332
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:21.840
<v Speaker 1>that were completely blameless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Moody,</v>

333
00:18:21.841 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 1>irritable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty,</v>

334
00:18:22.981 --> 00:18:27.981
<v Speaker 1>always in my head about something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even a negative comment or somebody even</v>

335
00:18:28.411 --> 00:18:29.244
<v Speaker 1>criticizing me and the slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightest would like set me off and I </v>

336
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:37.470
<v Speaker 1>would just shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even people that like respectfully would</v>

337
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:41.610
<v Speaker 1>disagree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with turn me like bitterly against them.</v>

338
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.520
<v Speaker 1>So on so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

339
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I was feeling I was being attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fit.</v>

340
00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

341
00:18:48.331 --> 00:18:49.260
<v Speaker 1>it feels like somebody is dying.</v>

342
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.970
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm physically being </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked,</v>

343
00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:55.920
<v Speaker 1>almost like a flight or fight or flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

344
00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.040
<v Speaker 1>so for the longest time being stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my head and not being able to.</v>

345
00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:02.380
<v Speaker 1>So the first two years I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

346
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt like I'm not been able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to grown or learn or maturing,</v>

347
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:07.643
<v Speaker 1>which is so difficult because I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt so stuck in like this really dark </v>

348
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.820
<v Speaker 1>black hole of negative feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just such an awful place.</v>

349
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.260
<v Speaker 1>And being so frustrated [inaudible] I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

350
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:19.230
<v Speaker 1>why am I stuck here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I get added here?</v>

351
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.490
<v Speaker 1>What do I do about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And growing more and more desperate,</v>

352
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the week and just falling deeper into</v>

353
00:19:25.591 --> 00:19:26.424
<v Speaker 1>that black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say about a month or two </v>

354
00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.400
<v Speaker 1>are about two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three months ago it was when I kinda hit</v>

355
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:36.600
<v Speaker 1>rock bottom and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so.</v>

356
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I was just so miserable that I was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired of being myself that I was willing</v>

357
00:19:43.531 --> 00:19:47.820
<v Speaker 1>to do anything to be anything I want.</v>

358
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.683
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know longer want it to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself because I was prescribed </v>

359
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:54.834
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants so long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all throughout my life doctors have </v>

360
00:19:58.951 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 1>been trying to get me to take them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've always not wanted to take them.</v>

361
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:07.071
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was probably that will.</v>

362
00:20:07.181 --> 00:20:09.490
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons was that I always </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like I wasn't,</v>

363
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.383
<v Speaker 1>hadn't done enough to fix myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I kind of had this unreasonable </v>

364
00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:18.150
<v Speaker 1>expectation that I should be exercising </v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours every day and eating salad for</v>

365
00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:21.180
<v Speaker 1>every meal and that somehow it's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Jeremiah depression.</v>

366
00:20:21.181 --> 00:20:22.014
<v Speaker 1>And until I had done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I had no right to take </v>

367
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.073
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think another aspect was that I </v>

368
00:20:28.471 --> 00:20:33.471
<v Speaker 1>felt that it was weak or that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would,</v>

369
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:38.880
<v Speaker 1>that I was weak or that it was somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving up or that it was,</v>

370
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.840
<v Speaker 1>it would change me.</v>

371
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:40.973
<v Speaker 1>I was afraid I'm not a big drug user </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't like altering my state </v>

372
00:20:44.281 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 1>of mind and I don't like becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliant on drugs.</v>

373
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.810
<v Speaker 1>But I was afraid that it would change </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

374
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.880
<v Speaker 1>And I think at that rock bottom moment I</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt so strongly that,</v>

375
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

376
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 1>if it changes me good because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be this person anymore.</v>

377
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember hearing,</v>

378
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:03.843
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I was thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this quote from Paul Mccartney and John </v>

379
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Lennon talked about acid use and Paul </v>
<v Speaker 1>said he never really loved it because he</v>

380
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:13.414
<v Speaker 1>was afraid of it changing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But John loved it so much because he </v>

381
00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:22.531
<v Speaker 1>wanted it to change him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I will always thought how,</v>

382
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:23.763
<v Speaker 1>what an interesting perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like I felt both of their </v>

383
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 1>perspectives now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

384
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 1>my whole life I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

385
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared to change and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from going from that,</v>

386
00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 1>like I'll do anything to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm praying that it changes me.</v>

387
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.660
<v Speaker 1>So I had this bottle of antidepressants </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my bedside and I said,</v>

388
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after dealing with this and hitting rock</v>

389
00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:53.381
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

390
00:21:53.381 --> 00:21:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I started taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

391
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.303
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had nothing to lose and I couldn't </v>

392
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:05.440
<v Speaker 1>really go on anymore like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

393
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

394
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.583
<v Speaker 1>I'll say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antidepressant is not at all what I </v>

395
00:22:12.911 --> 00:22:13.744
<v Speaker 1>thought it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first two to three weeks was a </v>

396
00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:17.494
<v Speaker 1>little rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as your body adjusts to their </v>

397
00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:22.540
<v Speaker 1>medicine because there was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

398
00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 1>first of all I was in such a bad place </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally.</v>

399
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:28.360
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda hard to tell what was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on in my mind and what I was feeling.</v>

400
00:22:28.361 --> 00:22:33.361
<v Speaker 1>But it definitely made me feel kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>like foggy and loopy and zoned out.</v>

401
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm really zoned out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes I would just be like,</v>

402
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:44.613
<v Speaker 1>just not just totally absent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can remember once in the driving lot </v>

403
00:22:47.361 --> 00:22:50.050
<v Speaker 1>of Ralph's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're driving and like,</v>

404
00:22:50.051 --> 00:22:51.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some,</v>

405
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.593
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crossing the street and you're almost </v>

406
00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:54.760
<v Speaker 1>done instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

407
00:22:54.761 --> 00:22:55.594
<v Speaker 1>I was driving super slow and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking slow watching my car so I was </v>

408
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 1>ever going to hit him because he saw me </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming,</v>

409
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.650
<v Speaker 1>but like he was standing there waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to stop for him and I was staring</v>

410
00:23:05.651 --> 00:23:06.484
<v Speaker 1>right at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was just inching forward and I </v>

411
00:23:09.491 --> 00:23:11.110
<v Speaker 1>just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to stop?</v>

412
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he taught and I just,</v>

413
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just so,</v>

414
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.820
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I almost,</v>

415
00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I actually almost gave up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant.</v>

416
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a time where I was like,</v>

417
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sucks.</v>

418
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.403
<v Speaker 1>But then I would say around like three </v>
<v Speaker 1>or four weeks because everybody says it </v>

419
00:23:30.941 --> 00:23:31.774
<v Speaker 1>can be rough in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it starts to work after like </v>

420
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:36.700
<v Speaker 1>three or four weeks and the side effects</v>
<v Speaker 1>go away.</v>

421
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of anxiety too about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to perform,</v>

422
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.413
<v Speaker 1>being able to come out in the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're make videos and feel like I'm </v>

423
00:23:43.081 --> 00:23:43.914
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I kind of proved to myself that I </v>

424
00:23:46.911 --> 00:23:47.744
<v Speaker 1>was capable of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's a lot of my anxiety about </v>

425
00:23:50.391 --> 00:23:51.224
<v Speaker 1>taking it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I noticed about the anti </v>

426
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.060
<v Speaker 1>depressant after all the side effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>went away and the fogginess and all this</v>

427
00:23:59.061 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 1>annoying stuff is that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda,</v>

428
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was not irritable anymore.</v>

429
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was still depressed.</v>

430
00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I was still anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was still miserable.</v>

431
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.533
<v Speaker 1>But what it did for me that has been so </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing and I'm so thankful for is that </v>

432
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:20.144
<v Speaker 1>it first of all remove the irrational </v>
<v Speaker 1>irritability and kind of gave me the </v>

433
00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:30.521
<v Speaker 1>foundation and the tools to start seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things more for what they are</v>

434
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.813
<v Speaker 6>and not</v>

435
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.273
<v Speaker 1>this kind of crazy irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irritable madness that I was </v>

436
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.633
<v Speaker 1>experiencing the world through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that for me was the first huge </v>

437
00:24:46.721 --> 00:24:51.010
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough I had in dealing with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

438
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.660
<v Speaker 1>And I would just notice it and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly at home with Isla and stuff.</v>

439
00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.653
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Things that usually cause somehow fight </v>

440
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:01.410
<v Speaker 5>for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden we were like,</v>

441
00:25:01.411 --> 00:25:02.940
<v Speaker 5>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we did this without Friday.</v>

442
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even get a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

443
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.930
<v Speaker 1>almost removed my irritability </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

444
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.430
<v Speaker 1>And I'm telling you this was</v>

445
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.073
<v Speaker 6>like</v>

446
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.540
<v Speaker 1>a godsend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean life changing,</v>

447
00:25:16.541 --> 00:25:19.240
<v Speaker 1>really life changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it hasn't changed anything else.</v>

448
00:25:19.241 --> 00:25:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely the same.</v>

449
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:22.563
<v Speaker 1>I'm just less irritable and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing what I learned about </v>

450
00:25:26.261 --> 00:25:27.094
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants that it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it does is blocks to your serotonin </v>

451
00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.360
<v Speaker 1>receivers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>

452
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.480
<v Speaker 1>as I understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I could be wrong about this,</v>

453
00:25:34.481 --> 00:25:35.314
<v Speaker 1>but it's called a serotonin uptake </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibitor and so your body produces </v>

454
00:25:40.061 --> 00:25:40.894
<v Speaker 1>serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which regulate your mood and your </v>

455
00:25:42.161 --> 00:25:44.050
<v Speaker 1>happiness and contentness and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

456
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And so this drug blocks the receptor </v>
<v Speaker 1>that absorbs the Serotonin,</v>

457
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.000
<v Speaker 1>so it makes more serotonin available for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>

458
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Teasers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

459
00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

460
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.470
<v Speaker 1>so it just makes you a little more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

461
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes your moods a little better.</v>

462
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I began for me,</v>

463
00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:07.900
<v Speaker 1>it didn't change me at all except that </v>
<v Speaker 1>my irritability completely went away.</v>

464
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.333
<v Speaker 1>And so things that were making me crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I was able to see it for what it </v>

465
00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:17.560
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I cannot.</v>

466
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.310
<v Speaker 5>Just little things like it's just </v>
<v Speaker 5>irrational.</v>

467
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.010
<v Speaker 5>So all of a sudden you see it as like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

468
00:26:24.011 --> 00:26:25.840
<v Speaker 5>it's just a little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not there.</v>

469
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.453
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where before it would set you off into </v>

470
00:26:29.051 --> 00:26:31.060
<v Speaker 5>like ruin my day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>running your day</v>

471
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.963
<v Speaker 1>or we will get in a fight and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would ruin and then I would feel bad </v>

472
00:26:34.251 --> 00:26:36.320
<v Speaker 1>about making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about snapping at you.</v>

473
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.360
<v Speaker 1>And it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like how was it for you?</v>

474
00:26:38.361 --> 00:26:39.350
<v Speaker 1>And when I started like,</v>

475
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.400
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I noticed it immediately.</v>

476
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.060
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden like it's almost like we</v>
<v Speaker 5>switched all of a sudden ICM,</v>

477
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.930
<v Speaker 5>irritable compared to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

478
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:51.540
<v Speaker 5>I know that like I'm not an irritable </v>
<v Speaker 5>person,</v>

479
00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:53.010
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No you're not.</v>

480
00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:55.210
<v Speaker 5>You've always been like super sane and </v>
<v Speaker 5>grounded and,</v>

481
00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.870
<v Speaker 5>and great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I and I,</v>

482
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't notice situations where I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

483
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.670
<v Speaker 5>so it's like we switched a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I would be like,</v>

484
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.270
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>

485
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.650
<v Speaker 5>something that would upset me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

486
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.513
<v Speaker 5>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fine.</v>

487
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

488
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.430
<v Speaker 5>but you're certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

489
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.630
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you're the same person.</v>

490
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:13.763
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

491
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.713
<v Speaker 1>So that was the first really important </v>
<v Speaker 1>step for me because I could now see </v>

492
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.690
<v Speaker 1>things clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could analyze things,</v>

493
00:27:21.691 --> 00:27:25.980
<v Speaker 1>clear and boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a difference.</v>

494
00:27:25.981 --> 00:27:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my goodness,</v>

495
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.760
<v Speaker 1>there's so much stigma against </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants and I really,</v>

496
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:31.010
<v Speaker 1>truly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

497
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.550
<v Speaker 1>and I was guilty of that</v>

498
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.030
<v Speaker 5>two I taught,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

499
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.913
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to take it if you don't </v>

500
00:27:35.751 --> 00:27:38.930
<v Speaker 5>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know why they had that.</v>

501
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is like you're a,</v>

502
00:27:40.421 --> 00:27:42.080
<v Speaker 1>you feel almost like a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're weak.</v>

503
00:27:42.081 --> 00:27:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Like you failed to solve your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

504
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Now before we started doing youtube and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

505
00:27:47.901 --> 00:27:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't that irritable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

506
00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.990
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was,</v>

507
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:51.893
<v Speaker 1>it kind of made me feel more like how I </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to remember being in a sense that </v>

508
00:27:55.011 --> 00:27:55.844
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always prided myself on being a more </v>

509
00:27:57.381 --> 00:27:59.030
<v Speaker 1>calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational,</v>

510
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.923
<v Speaker 1>rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational person and that kind of the </v>

511
00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:08.140
<v Speaker 1>self image I had kind of melted away and</v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced me with this really grumpy,</v>

512
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.520
<v Speaker 1>obnoxious person that I was starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate</v>

513
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.410
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was huge.</v>

514
00:28:17.411 --> 00:28:18.244
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's huge and I'm still on it and I'm </v>

515
00:28:19.541 --> 00:28:24.130
<v Speaker 1>so happy that I'm taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember in college once there was,</v>

516
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:26.583
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having awful anxiety and you guys </v>

517
00:28:29.951 --> 00:28:31.960
<v Speaker 1>might know I had like generalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorder.</v>

518
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.033
<v Speaker 1>I could have benefited so much from </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants in college and I </v>

519
00:28:35.591 --> 00:28:36.424
<v Speaker 1>remember there was a sign at my very </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive school ucse and it said </v>

520
00:28:40.391 --> 00:28:41.224
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had like Prozac and PROZAC nation </v>

521
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.600
<v Speaker 1>making some artsy claim that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

522
00:28:46.601 --> 00:28:48.760
<v Speaker 1>we're all overmedicated and we're all on</v>
<v Speaker 1>PROZAC.</v>

523
00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.820
<v Speaker 1>And the undertone being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need this,</v>

524
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.700
<v Speaker 1>you're weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a sucker if you take it.</v>

525
00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.070
<v Speaker 1>And I remember seeing that being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

526
00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.100
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who needs that shit?</v>

527
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.920
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a very popular sentiment.</v>

528
00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I would say very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of like a anti-corporate,</v>

529
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.940
<v Speaker 1>like anti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we don't need your medicine.</v>

530
00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

531
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm a person that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

532
00:29:14.921 --> 00:29:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an ego problem.</v>

533
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.593
<v Speaker 1>And so admitting to myself that I'm weak</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that I need the help of a medicine </v>

534
00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.613
<v Speaker 1>for me was difficult to [inaudible] was </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to accept because it's in a </v>

535
00:29:33.461 --> 00:29:36.670
<v Speaker 1>sense felt like a weakness that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't handle it myself.</v>

536
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:41.170
<v Speaker 1>The truth is about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've learned is that looking,</v>

537
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.200
<v Speaker 1>reaching out for help outside yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the first and the most important step</v>

538
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:52.060
<v Speaker 1>and recovering from a situation like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this because it's not a weakness,</v>

539
00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:52.894
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's truly a strength because you have </v>

540
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:56.374
<v Speaker 1>to get over your own ego and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept the grace and the help of other </v>

541
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:03.310
<v Speaker 1>people and the tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

542
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.580
<v Speaker 1>this is a well researched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funded,</v>

543
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:07.983
<v Speaker 1>backed by an incredible intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>researchers and doctors and </v>

544
00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:15.510
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to just write that off because you,</v>

545
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.421
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

546
00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:21.110
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's stupid.</v>

547
00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.670
<v Speaker 1>That's not strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's dumb.</v>

548
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was one aspect and now I'm,</v>

549
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:30.403
<v Speaker 1>the antidepressants are helping but I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously still depressed and I am </v>

550
00:30:32.871 --> 00:30:36.470
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

551
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:38.960
<v Speaker 1>not cured by any means.</v>

552
00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.513
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

553
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.033
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was the next really important </v>

554
00:30:49.641 --> 00:30:50.474
<v Speaker 1>step is that I was recommended a </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist from a friend that I've been </v>

555
00:30:53.991 --> 00:30:57.470
<v Speaker 1>doing for about like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably about a month or two months,</v>

556
00:30:57.471 --> 00:30:59.970
<v Speaker 1>a month and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

557
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.870
<v Speaker 1>the therapy has been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been skeptical about therapy</v>

558
00:31:05.871 --> 00:31:06.704
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably for the wrong reasons </v>

559
00:31:07.191 --> 00:31:12.191
<v Speaker 1>because it feels like week to say to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another person,</v>

560
00:31:12.231 --> 00:31:13.064
<v Speaker 1>I need help.</v>

561
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.013
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

562
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.640
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like to think that you can.</v>

563
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:22.683
<v Speaker 1>You cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to understand what's going </v>

564
00:31:24.221 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 1>on in your own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like again,</v>

565
00:31:26.021 --> 00:31:26.870
<v Speaker 1>therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

566
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.190
<v Speaker 1>My doctor is a phd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy has learned,</v>

567
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.540
<v Speaker 1>studied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schooled.</v>

568
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.823
<v Speaker 1>This guy knows how the mind works and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trained to diagnose it and to </v>

569
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:38.920
<v Speaker 1>almost debug it.</v>

570
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:39.983
<v Speaker 5>I think it's probably seen so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in so many patterns can </v>

571
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.460
<v Speaker 5>immediately like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

572
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:45.653
<v Speaker 5>put together something from what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>describing that you would never even </v>

573
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.760
<v Speaker 5>see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

574
00:31:50.761 --> 00:31:51.810
<v Speaker 5>he's seen it all man,</v>

575
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:54.783
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that like stuff from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood and the way I was raised and </v>

576
00:31:58.570 --> 00:31:59.403
<v Speaker 1>the way that I reacted things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's psychological explanations that </v>

577
00:32:02.351 --> 00:32:03.184
<v Speaker 1>are so important to explore so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can deepen your understanding of not </v>

578
00:32:07.481 --> 00:32:08.314
<v Speaker 1>only yourself but the world that gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>you this incredible empathy for how </v>

579
00:32:11.531 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 1>other people's minds work and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're affected by their environment.</v>

580
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.693
<v Speaker 1>And as I touched on earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a very good psychological </v>

581
00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:21.124
<v Speaker 1>explanation for why I get so defensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shut down from criticism that I </v>

582
00:32:27.761 --> 00:32:28.594
<v Speaker 1>don't want really need to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just goes back to the way I was </v>

583
00:32:30.551 --> 00:32:34.300
<v Speaker 1>raised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just learning about that and knowing</v>

584
00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:35.134
<v Speaker 1>about that and talking about it is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic and it's so important that </v>

585
00:32:41.601 --> 00:32:42.434
<v Speaker 1>it's given me such a good vantage point </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's given me kind of the tools and </v>

586
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:46.514
<v Speaker 1>a little more support and foundation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to even come here and talk to you </v>

587
00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:54.080
<v Speaker 1>guys about this like this now and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it more of a healthy way and</v>

588
00:32:54.081 --> 00:32:54.914
<v Speaker 1>to</v>

589
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.253
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

590
00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:01.230
<v Speaker 1>it'll last time I came in here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>address Chris and all the podcasts I was</v>

591
00:33:01.231 --> 00:33:05.400
<v Speaker 1>ranting and raving and going look in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a freaking lunatic.</v>

592
00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:07.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

593
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.963
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

594
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.300
<v Speaker 1>that's just the symptom of everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was describing.</v>

595
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:15.423
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to come here and talk about </v>

596
00:33:17.471 --> 00:33:18.304
<v Speaker 1>this with you guys I think is important </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me because I see the podcast as if </v>

597
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:31.790
<v Speaker 1>nothing else honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

598
00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:34.700
<v Speaker 1>like when I sit here for two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>

599
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:38.030
<v Speaker 1>unedited over the course of nearly 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes,</v>

600
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:41.360
<v Speaker 1>now 100 and hundreds of hours of footage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me unedited.</v>

601
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.940
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing else but at least honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

602
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Because I cannot hide who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot hide my defects,</v>

603
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.880
<v Speaker 1>cannot hide my stupid comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot hide my um,</v>

604
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:58.530
<v Speaker 1>short temper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My dushene is my shitty hosting it,</v>

605
00:33:58.570 --> 00:33:59.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

606
00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:01.250
<v Speaker 1>if I recorded this and put it into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

607
00:34:01.251 --> 00:34:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I would cut all that shit out.</v>

608
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or like you,</v>

609
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.840
<v Speaker 5>you'll try a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>

610
00:34:05.841 --> 00:34:08.270
<v Speaker 5>well that didn't come off right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's do it again.</v>

611
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:13.040
<v Speaker 5>But here you don't even to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you can't know.</v>

612
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:14.970
<v Speaker 1>And to be honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

613
00:34:14.971 --> 00:34:15.804
<v Speaker 1>this podcast has been one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult things I've ever done in my </v>

614
00:34:18.241 --> 00:34:21.870
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like physically,</v>

615
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.260
<v Speaker 1>if you talk about it from the standpoint</v>
<v Speaker 1>of just sitting and doing it,</v>

616
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.080
<v Speaker 1>it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

617
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.240
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sit here,</v>

618
00:34:30.241 --> 00:34:31.800
<v Speaker 1>you show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk and you know,</v>

619
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.520
<v Speaker 1>but from a psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a mental,</v>

620
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.330
<v Speaker 1>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a lot of other positions,</v>

621
00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:40.530
<v Speaker 1>this is the hardest thing I've ever had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do because one,</v>

622
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.183
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

623
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 1>there's no take backs and so not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

624
00:34:50.031 --> 00:34:53.510
<v Speaker 1>the fans forced to see me more clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>of who I am,</v>

625
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.553
<v Speaker 1>but I am forced to see them more clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>of who I am because I'm someone that's </v>

626
00:34:58.431 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 1>criticized youtubers and people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>

627
00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:01.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see,</v>

628
00:35:01.341 --> 00:35:02.174
<v Speaker 1>it's very people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very nice when you post videos and </v>

629
00:35:04.821 --> 00:35:08.720
<v Speaker 1>you can manage your it and put it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you put it out for the people to see</v>

630
00:35:08.721 --> 00:35:09.554
<v Speaker 1>you one way and you get to see yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>one way too because you cut out the </v>

631
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.233
<v Speaker 1>stupid shit and you forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people see the video and </v>

632
00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:17.390
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

633
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.920
<v Speaker 1>this guy is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

634
00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:20.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am great.</v>

635
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.020
<v Speaker 1>And you forget about you while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a fucking asshole.</v>

636
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.680
<v Speaker 1>You're an hour of you being an asshole </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then 10 minutes over your bearing.</v>

637
00:35:27.681 --> 00:35:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

638
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:30.943
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

639
00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:33.813
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

640
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised that so many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have watched his podcast and been like,</v>

641
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:39.923
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the guy I thought he was or </v>

642
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:47.100
<v Speaker 1>people who are making videos about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things I mentioned because yeah,</v>

643
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is all in here.</v>

644
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.393
<v Speaker 1>Everything you guys have said bad about </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and that you've noticed all my bad </v>

645
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:57.540
<v Speaker 1>personality traits and all that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all in here,</v>

646
00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't lie about that stuff.</v>

647
00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:06.500
<v Speaker 1>It's all here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's been difficult,</v>

648
00:36:06.501 --> 00:36:07.334
<v Speaker 1>especially with this condition I've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being like depressed and irritable </v>

649
00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:16.010
<v Speaker 1>and having a psychological Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a unhealthy response to criticism,</v>

650
00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's all played out here</v>

651
00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:19.893
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's Kinda the only way to do the </v>

652
00:36:21.081 --> 00:36:23.930
<v Speaker 5>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like our first five episodes.</v>

653
00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:27.830
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we were trying to edit it down the</v>
<v Speaker 5>footage and thinking about it.</v>

654
00:36:27.831 --> 00:36:31.910
<v Speaker 5>Like we used to think about a video but </v>
<v Speaker 5>it just wasn't right.</v>

655
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.863
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're cutting now in conversation and </v>

656
00:36:34.431 --> 00:36:38.600
<v Speaker 5>then you're making decisions on what to </v>
<v Speaker 5>live and it's not natural.</v>

657
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.490
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We came to the conclusion that it has to</v>

658
00:36:43.491 --> 00:36:44.660
<v Speaker 5>be like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

659
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:45.523
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

660
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Needs to be honest,</v>

661
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:48.583
<v Speaker 1>it needs to be uncut because you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see the essence and the soul of </v>

662
00:36:50.931 --> 00:36:53.120
<v Speaker 1>what's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times,</v>

663
00:36:53.121 --> 00:36:53.954
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you though we would try to cut out a </v>

664
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.640
<v Speaker 1>part of me saying something stupid or </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not just me,</v>

665
00:36:58.641 --> 00:36:59.550
<v Speaker 1>but the gas stove.</v>

666
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.151
<v Speaker 5>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

667
00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:01.200
<v Speaker 5>this is a boring moment.</v>

668
00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.270
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>

669
00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.460
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people were feeling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're feeling that,</v>

670
00:37:07.461 --> 00:37:09.010
<v Speaker 1>that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a weird.</v>

671
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.193
<v Speaker 1>And so we took this leap into doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>live and it's been really tough and </v>

672
00:37:13.931 --> 00:37:14.920
<v Speaker 1>really challenging and</v>

673
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:16.263
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

674
00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:20.990
<v Speaker 1>very exposing of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here bare naked in a way.</v>

675
00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.693
<v Speaker 1>But I also think it's been really </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing for me too because it's kind of </v>

676
00:37:25.491 --> 00:37:26.324
<v Speaker 1>brought me here now where I've been able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just take finally a close look at </v>

677
00:37:31.611 --> 00:37:32.444
<v Speaker 1>myself and see it for 'em,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it more clearly in a way that I've </v>

678
00:37:40.161 --> 00:37:40.994
<v Speaker 1>craved so much these past two years to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just feel like I'm maturing and I'm </v>

679
00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:49.120
<v Speaker 1>growing and I'm becoming a better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more wholesome person.</v>

680
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:52.400
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

681
00:37:52.401 --> 00:37:54.780
<v Speaker 1>why am I so fucking stuck with trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be crazy?</v>

682
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would say that to me a lot to stop.</v>

683
00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:01.200
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like I'm stuck.</v>

684
00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:06.890
<v Speaker 1>That's where or how or where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just feeling like I'm just pinned to</v>

685
00:38:07.101 --> 00:38:10.220
<v Speaker 1>the floor or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way in a hamster wheel.</v>

686
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:12.763
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

687
00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:17.493
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been an amazing experience in that </v>

688
00:38:19.691 --> 00:38:22.990
<v Speaker 1>way that we've all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've all been just,</v>

689
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:23.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

690
00:38:23.741 --> 00:38:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said those things,</v>

691
00:38:25.811 --> 00:38:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I did those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am that person</v>

692
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.553
<v Speaker 1>and it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to acknowledge that and feel </v>

693
00:38:33.331 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 1>that and be like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

694
00:38:36.191 --> 00:38:37.070
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to,</v>

695
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:41.080
<v Speaker 1>you got to accept that catches walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>blindly.</v>

696
00:38:41.081 --> 00:38:44.080
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it's just so messed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

697
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a black hole and it's not,</v>

698
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.210
<v Speaker 1>it's just what I didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

699
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.083
<v Speaker 1>it's strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not weakness to come before </v>

700
00:38:54.191 --> 00:38:59.191
<v Speaker 1>yourself and confront your many </v>
<v Speaker 1>shortcomings as a human being instead of</v>

701
00:39:02.111 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 1>ignoring them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I was just,</v>

702
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was too painful for me too.</v>

703
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.073
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ego was hurt and I was just too </v>

704
00:39:15.461 --> 00:39:16.330
<v Speaker 1>painful for me.</v>

705
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:18.223
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

706
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.480
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The psychology of it is so weird.</v>

707
00:39:27.481 --> 00:39:28.314
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it'd be so easy to just be </v>

708
00:39:29.311 --> 00:39:29.581
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

709
00:39:29.581 --> 00:39:30.361
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

710
00:39:30.361 --> 00:39:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can be so painful.</v>

711
00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:38.250
<v Speaker 1>As Elton John Famously said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

712
00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Seems to be the hardest word.</v>

713
00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:42.403
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

714
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

715
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.560
<v Speaker 1>So it can be so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not for other people,</v>

716
00:39:46.561 --> 00:39:49.920
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my specific problem.</v>

717
00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I think that I'm now learning about </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

718
00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:59.340
<v Speaker 1>And I said the Ila something recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still depressed,</v>

719
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.280
<v Speaker 1>but for the first time in such a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

720
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a light at the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the tunnel,</v>

721
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.360
<v Speaker 1>which for me it was this black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no escape,</v>

722
00:40:09.361 --> 00:40:10.194
<v Speaker 1>there was no answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I could think of was just permanent </v>

723
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.073
<v Speaker 1>darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now a subtle name with the help of </v>

724
00:40:19.441 --> 00:40:21.750
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the help of therapy,</v>

725
00:40:21.751 --> 00:40:22.584
<v Speaker 1>with the help of antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the help of Isla has been with me </v>

726
00:40:25.891 --> 00:40:30.891
<v Speaker 1>this whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just finally I can kind of see a</v>

727
00:40:33.601 --> 00:40:38.601
<v Speaker 1>path forward to getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a path to walk towards the light,</v>

728
00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

729
00:40:42.301 --> 00:40:43.860
<v Speaker 1>with a kid on the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>

730
00:40:43.861 --> 00:40:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be better than this,</v>

731
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:53.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like asking them to be tough,</v>

732
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.190
<v Speaker 1>tough enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to make it harder.</v>

733
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

734
00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:04.544
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

736
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I readily admit that I've been at times </v>
<v Speaker 1>the awful host,</v>

737
00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:20.570
<v Speaker 1>a terrible interviewer here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the awful habits as a podcast host,</v>

738
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:24.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

739
00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:27.340
<v Speaker 1>speak on things that I don't know nearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough about.</v>

740
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:28.323
<v Speaker 1>Speak with certainty about things that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't and I definitely need to do </v>

741
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 1>better on these fronts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to be better,</v>

742
00:41:35.211 --> 00:41:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I need to do better and I expect myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to be better.</v>

743
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.693
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

744
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I've heard someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who said it,</v>

745
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.590
<v Speaker 1>but they said if you're under a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>

746
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.750
<v Speaker 1>then you really have no idea what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

747
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.500
<v Speaker 1>And I really hope that's true because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're co,</v>

748
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.373
<v Speaker 1>this is number 93 and I know I still </v>
<v Speaker 1>have so much to learn and improve as a </v>

749
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:57.890
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a host,</v>

750
00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.400
<v Speaker 1>as an entertainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a human being,</v>

751
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:03.920
<v Speaker 1>and we only have seven figures now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

752
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Speaker 1>despite all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many of you have continued to support</v>

753
00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:08.474
<v Speaker 1>us and show us love and appreciation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see the goodness and the sweetness </v>

754
00:42:13.461 --> 00:42:18.461
<v Speaker 1>end me despite my best efforts to thwart</v>
<v Speaker 1>you at times.</v>

755
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I think part of me was so I was so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

756
00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.413
<v Speaker 1>felt so distance from the fans in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently because on one hand there's </v>

757
00:42:29.001 --> 00:42:31.970
<v Speaker 1>people that hate me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm like,</v>

758
00:42:31.971 --> 00:42:32.804
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to read the comment </v>

759
00:42:33.681 --> 00:42:36.740
<v Speaker 1>because I'm too fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the people that love me,</v>

760
00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.210
<v Speaker 1>I feel like because I hated myself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't love myself,</v>

761
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.840
<v Speaker 1>that the love that they will show me </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't genuine,</v>

762
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.100
<v Speaker 1>that I couldn't accept it.</v>

763
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.900
<v Speaker 1>It was just them being nice or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

764
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.420
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

765
00:42:56.421 --> 00:42:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

766
00:42:57.261 --> 00:42:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't accept any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just too much for me,</v>

767
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.963
<v Speaker 1>but I do want to say that from the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>sincere and appreciative plates for the </v>

768
00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:07.304
<v Speaker 1>people that have continued to believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and see something good in me and </v>

769
00:43:11.601 --> 00:43:12.434
<v Speaker 1>something here that you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is amazing and it means so much </v>

770
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:22.841
<v Speaker 1>to me and I wanted to thank you all for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your kind comments on the episode before</v>

771
00:43:23.481 --> 00:43:24.314
<v Speaker 1>the Tom and Christina episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had made a side that nobody seemed to </v>

772
00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:28.094
<v Speaker 1>like the podcast when there was a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>outpouring of love and support and the </v>

773
00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:34.100
<v Speaker 1>column is telling me that I should keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>it up and that you guys love it.</v>

774
00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:34.934
<v Speaker 1>That was unexpected and very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciated and a time that I really </v>

775
00:43:40.761 --> 00:43:41.594
<v Speaker 1>needed to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have thought about quitting the </v>

776
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:46.960
<v Speaker 1>podcasts honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

777
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:47.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

778
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:49.763
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

779
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:53.410
<v Speaker 1>because it's been such a pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

780
00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:57.610
<v Speaker 1>it's been such a pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been so painful at times,</v>

781
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:59.343
<v Speaker 1>but I hope there's been good things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to focus on the pain and the </v>

782
00:44:02.471 --> 00:44:05.320
<v Speaker 1>field of pain and talk about the Pan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hope there's also</v>

783
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.693
<v Speaker 6>no</v>

784
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.030
<v Speaker 1>another side to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do see that side,</v>

785
00:44:13.031 --> 00:44:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I thank you so much for sticking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

786
00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:22.890
<v Speaker 1>And in closing to this long monologue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has gone quite a bit longer than I</v>

787
00:44:24.701 --> 00:44:26.920
<v Speaker 1>expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

788
00:44:26.921 --> 00:44:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I wanna say that if I have disappointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

789
00:44:29.171 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I can be better</v>

790
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.023
<v Speaker 4>and I want to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to those that have continued to </v>

791
00:44:34.951 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 4>support us and spend your Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your blessing Fridays here with us.</v>

792
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:44.160
<v Speaker 4>I want to say thank you for believing in</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and looking past my imperfections and</v>

793
00:44:44.161 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 4>giving me the strength and support to </v>
<v Speaker 4>push through it.</v>

794
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:48.923
<v Speaker 4>And I do think that it's important for </v>
<v Speaker 4>me to talk about these things because I </v>

795
00:44:52.171 --> 00:44:53.004
<v Speaker 4>think there's a lot of people out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>that can relate to my feelings of this </v>

796
00:44:58.681 --> 00:45:02.040
<v Speaker 4>whole depressive attitude and putting </v>
<v Speaker 4>off getting help.</v>

797
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:05.190
<v Speaker 4>Because somehow for whatever reason in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your head,</v>

798
00:45:05.191 --> 00:45:08.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure everyone has their own reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that it makes you vulnerable or weak</v>

799
00:45:08.941 --> 00:45:13.740
<v Speaker 4>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I hope that people can take anything</v>

800
00:45:13.741 --> 00:45:14.574
<v Speaker 4>from this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That it's actually your weakness and </v>

801
00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 4>your vulnerability is part of what makes</v>
<v Speaker 4>you human.</v>

802
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:26.150
<v Speaker 4>And acknowledging that and reaching out </v>
<v Speaker 4>to help his strength,</v>

803
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:27.773
<v Speaker 4>not weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weakness is shutting yourself off from </v>

804
00:45:29.551 --> 00:45:30.384
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you can fix all your own </v>

805
00:45:31.561 --> 00:45:32.394
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just bitter self-loathing </v>

806
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.500
<v Speaker 4>weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I hope that,</v>

807
00:45:43.501 --> 00:45:47.510
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone out there that is feeling,</v>

808
00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.913
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling anything similar to what I said </v>

809
00:45:51.381 --> 00:45:54.890
<v Speaker 4>that you do try antidepressants and </v>
<v Speaker 4>therapy.</v>

810

<v Speaker 1>is my new passion in life,</v>

950
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:22.520
<v Speaker 1>but I have to wait a week and spending </v>
<v Speaker 1>time on the fabric.</v>

951
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in so deep and that is like gun a</v>

952
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:26.843
<v Speaker 4>ula,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Larissa and they are in jail and I'm </v>

953
00:53:28.921 --> 00:53:30.150
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are you talking about?</v>

954
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:33.110
<v Speaker 4>And there's like 90 day fiance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

955
00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.770
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating.</v>

956
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:35.993
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you talk about them like it's a </v>

957
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:38.560
<v Speaker 4>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really mad,</v>

958
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:39.623
<v Speaker 4>so freaking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like there's this really vibrant </v>

959
00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:42.504
<v Speaker 4>community on Reddit of 90 day fiance and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got all these great memes and </v>

960
00:53:45.781 --> 00:53:50.610
<v Speaker 4>discussions and it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so good.</v>

961
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.900
<v Speaker 4>But I need something to watch in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>week between.</v>

962
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:59.820
<v Speaker 4>And so the new show that I've found is </v>
<v Speaker 4>called extreme cheapskates.</v>

963
00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:06.050
<v Speaker 4>Now these people are cheap on a level </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is probably should be classified as</v>

964
00:54:06.481 --> 00:54:07.314
<v Speaker 4>a mental ill because in real it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm getting what's on sale at </v>

965
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:13.764
<v Speaker 4>Ralph's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like getting these guys like </v>

966
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.510
<v Speaker 4>there's a guy and they're like proud of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it too.</v>

967
00:54:18.511 --> 00:54:20.370
<v Speaker 4>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all,</v>

968
00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.413
<v Speaker 4>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all have significant others that </v>

969
00:54:24.781 --> 00:54:26.670
<v Speaker 4>are super embarrassed by them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I find.</v>

970
00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:31.940
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and marriage and they seem exactly,</v>

971
00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:35.070
<v Speaker 4>they all seem to be in really healthy </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships.</v>

972
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.830
<v Speaker 4>But like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this one guy,</v>

973
00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:40.080
<v Speaker 4>he's like 40 and he's retired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

974
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.183
<v Speaker 4>I have financial freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm retired from being a cheapskate and </v>

975
00:54:44.641 --> 00:54:46.440
<v Speaker 4>none of my other friends have this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

976
00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:47.933
<v Speaker 4>this freedom in life and this guy spends</v>
<v Speaker 4>his whole day biking around for 12 </v>

977
00:54:51.661 --> 00:54:53.010
<v Speaker 4>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not because he loves biking,</v>

978
00:54:53.011 --> 00:54:58.011
<v Speaker 4>but because gas is too expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm checking phone machines for money,</v>

979
00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:03.150
<v Speaker 4>going to diners and checking the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cushions for coins and it's like,</v>

980
00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.190
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't sound like financial </v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom.</v>

981
00:55:05.191 --> 00:55:09.480
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like you could just get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>job and work less hours,</v>

982
00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:14.640
<v Speaker 4>but they have got like this need to save</v>
<v Speaker 4>money in any way.</v>

983
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:18.030
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this need to feel like.</v>

984
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:20.260
<v Speaker 4>I think they got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

985
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:21.343
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got that one up and I'm the result </v>

986
00:55:25.261 --> 00:55:27.120
<v Speaker 4>of some of this stuff is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>bananas.</v>

987
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:31.320
<v Speaker 4>So this is one of my favorite guys here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's such a legend.</v>

988
00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:35.790
<v Speaker 4>He's a legend that during the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>season they only had six episodes of sky</v>

989
00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.670
<v Speaker 4>was in two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

990
00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:39.504
<v Speaker 4>on Amazon videos you can decide to buy a</v>
<v Speaker 4>season hd or SD and I went super in the </v>

991
00:55:45.871 --> 00:55:48.390
<v Speaker 4>spirit of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh by the way,</v>

992
00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:52.163
<v Speaker 4>it's going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were going to make a video and it </v>

993
00:55:55.081 --> 00:55:55.914
<v Speaker 4>didn't work out and all this left is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid fucking Erica that was going to </v>

994
00:56:00.981 --> 00:56:02.320
<v Speaker 4>say you've got to show them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

995
00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.100
<v Speaker 4>I love that the video didn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're keeping the haircut.</v>

996
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.983
<v Speaker 4>We had this whole idea for video was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be so good and I cut my hair </v>

997
00:56:20.521 --> 00:56:21.354
<v Speaker 4>for the reaction and all these sketches </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're sitting down editing it </v>

998
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:26.320
<v Speaker 4>yesterday and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're both like,</v>

999
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 4>this isn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just cut my hair for nothing.</v>

1000
00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:33.083
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I'll walk outside because I </v>

1001
00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:38.170
<v Speaker 4>feel completely normal and I'll forget </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1002
00:56:38.171 --> 00:56:42.910
<v Speaker 4>My hair looks like this and I'll walk </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside without thinking a walk shredder</v>

1003
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.480
<v Speaker 4>and you just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just that guy.</v>

1004
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.033
<v Speaker 4>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some days I'll look in the mirror like </v>

1005
00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:52.570

<v Speaker 4>I'm almost a kind of a good look.</v>

1007
00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:57.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was a little more symmetrical.</v>

1008
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:01.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way we kind of have your head tilted</v>

1009
00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:03.370
<v Speaker 4>to the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that side looks okay,</v>

1010
00:57:03.371 --> 00:57:07.750
<v Speaker 4>but then you know that it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Madmax cool.</v>

1013
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:19.803
<v Speaker 4>So you know what's been interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I buzzed my whole head and I </v>

1014
00:57:22.991 --> 00:57:27.991
<v Speaker 4>took a fricking razor blade and razor </v>
<v Speaker 4>blade my scalp and that was gnarly dude.</v>

1015
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:32.170
<v Speaker 4>But it was actually kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to say.</v>

1016
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:34.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was painful.</v>

1017
00:57:34.811 --> 00:57:35.644
<v Speaker 4>It was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a new appreciation for people </v>

1018
00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:41.200
<v Speaker 4>that shaved their heads with razors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was kind of Nice.</v>

1019
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:44.470
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm going to buzz it all off and</v>
<v Speaker 4>bic my whole fricking head.</v>

1020
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:46.083
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's such a freedom in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>because your hair's gonna grow back all </v>

<v Speaker 4>episodes the first season.</v>

1030
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:23.103
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I was saying is that on Amazon you </v>

1031
00:58:25.061 --> 00:58:30.061
<v Speaker 4>can buy a season hd or you can buy an SD</v>
<v Speaker 4>and save $1 and you have to dig.</v>

1032
00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:34.900
<v Speaker 4>They have a more options button.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to go in there.</v>

1033
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:38.470
<v Speaker 4>And in the spirit of extreme cheap </v>
<v Speaker 4>skating,</v>

1034
00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:39.843
<v Speaker 4>I saved a dollar on this season.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was very proud and honored with these </v>

1035
00:58:42.821 --> 00:58:43.654
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

1036
00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:48.100
<v Speaker 8>Most people consider the paper towels </v>
<v Speaker 8>and disposable,</v>

1037
00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:53.160
<v Speaker 8>like reusing spruce it up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>bring it back to life through set up.</v>

1038
00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:57.970
<v Speaker 8>Eva could reuse these paper towels three</v>
<v Speaker 8>to five times.</v>

1039
00:58:58.650 --> 00:59:03.280
<v Speaker 8>Roy estimates that over the last 10 </v>
<v Speaker 8>years he saved nearly $2,000</v>

1040
00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:04.323
<v Speaker 8>just by reusing paper towels,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he also went down to a federal </v>

1041
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.100
<v Speaker 8>savings,</v>
<v Speaker 8>totally the truth,</v>

1042
00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.120
<v Speaker 8>which are kind of flimsy on these </v>
<v Speaker 8>disposables.</v>

1043
00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:16.450
<v Speaker 8>They get dull.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I sharpen them on the striking part of a</v>

1044
00:59:16.451 --> 00:59:17.284
<v Speaker 8>book of matches.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Give them a whole new life when you </v>

1045
00:59:19.301 --> 00:59:23.030
<v Speaker 8>can't squeeze anymore out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Finished to be emptied.</v>

1046
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:28.870
<v Speaker 8>That's the end.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And they just toss it away and there's a</v>

1047
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:33.883
<v Speaker 8>week's worth still left in there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I buy cheap to ply toilet paper and I </v>

1048
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:41.540
<v Speaker 8>get two rolls out of one</v>

1049
00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:46.650
<v Speaker 4>that I have that I said you need those </v>
<v Speaker 4>two plys buddy.</v>

1050
00:59:46.651 --> 00:59:51.651
<v Speaker 4>Especially at your consumption level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've seen.</v>

1051
00:59:53.521 --> 00:59:55.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did he eats too in that?</v>

1052
00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.910
<v Speaker 4>Do we have the clip of him at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant?</v>

1053
00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:58.990
<v Speaker 4>Because I need that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1054
00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.630
<v Speaker 4>but we haven't done one in the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to watch that one.</v>

1055
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.433
<v Speaker 4>This is nothing</v>

1056
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:05.343
<v Speaker 8>price.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I do not enjoy two ply toilet paper </v>

1057
01:00:07.511 --> 01:00:11.920
<v Speaker 8>being separate.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just kind of threefold it so that it's</v>

1058
01:00:11.921 --> 01:00:15.370
<v Speaker 8>a little thicker.</v>
<v Speaker 8>His toilet play third is a lot like life</v>

1059
01:00:15.371 --> 01:00:18.460
<v Speaker 8>in general.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The closer you get to the end,</v>

1060
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.930
<v Speaker 8>the faster it seems to go.</v>

1061
01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.253
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The funny thing about that I've noticed </v>

1062
01:00:25.861 --> 01:00:27.350
<v Speaker 4>about these cheapskate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1063
01:00:27.351 --> 01:00:28.184
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheapskates is that they spent so much </v>

1064
01:00:31.891 --> 01:00:32.724
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it cannot be a worthy investment of </v>

1065
01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:36.000
<v Speaker 4>their time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess they don't work.</v>

1066
01:00:36.001 --> 01:00:36.834
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like the guy will spend an hour d </v>

1067
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:46.500
<v Speaker 4>flying and then re rolling a roll of </v>
<v Speaker 4>toilet paper to save like,</v>

1068
01:00:47.351 --> 01:00:49.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>twenty five cents or something.</v>

1069
01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:51.603
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1070
01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:52.563
<v Speaker 4>these guys have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you've got to see this guy at the </v>

1071
01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:56.890
<v Speaker 4>restaurant because that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that really ain't ain't nothing.</v>

1072
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:59.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see here.</v>

1073
01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.480
<v Speaker 4>Extreme cheapskates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't I look for it?</v>

1074
01:01:04.481 --> 01:01:05.314
<v Speaker 4>And you watch that clip where I got it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's too late and that it's a clip of </v>

1075
01:01:12.271 --> 01:01:13.680
<v Speaker 4>the movie day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got this one.</v>

1076
01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.090
<v Speaker 8>I can't believe Roy brought me to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>movies.</v>

1077
01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:18.450
<v Speaker 8>I haven't been to the movie and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 8>know.</v>

1078
01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.210
<v Speaker 4>So she's begging him this whole episode </v>
<v Speaker 4>to take her on a date night,</v>

1079
01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:23.610
<v Speaker 4>which I guess they do once a month or is</v>
<v Speaker 4>it once a year?</v>

1080
01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:24.863
<v Speaker 4>Once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so she wants him just to buy them a </v>

1081
01:01:27.961 --> 01:01:30.900
<v Speaker 4>soda pop and some popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

1082
01:01:30.901 --> 01:01:32.850
<v Speaker 4>well come on baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you crazy?</v>

1083
01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:38.460
<v Speaker 4>So he has a novel idea that some of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could use at home and yourself.</v>

1084
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.010
<v Speaker 8>So are you hungry?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1085
01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.280
<v Speaker 8>I've told you I wanted something to </v>
<v Speaker 8>pass.</v>

1086
01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:49.143
<v Speaker 8>So Mike could,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I haven't been at a big waste of money </v>

1087
01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:57.751
<v Speaker 8>to buy food at the snack bar with </v>
<v Speaker 8>concessions in any movie theater here.</v>

1088
01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.433
<v Speaker 8>Keep it low here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People smuggled food into the movies </v>

1089
01:02:02.371 --> 01:02:04.270
<v Speaker 8>theaters all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't like it,</v>

1090
01:02:04.271 --> 01:02:07.180
<v Speaker 8>but they do it by bringing my own </v>
<v Speaker 8>snacks.</v>

1091
01:02:07.181 --> 01:02:09.340
<v Speaker 8>I save at least another $10.</v>

1092
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.910
<v Speaker 4>Eating a banana and moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a sad shit.</v>

1093
01:02:11.911 --> 01:02:12.744
<v Speaker 4>I can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a banana and he's begging him </v>

1094
01:02:17.961 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 4>the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want a and popcorn.</v>

1095
01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.730
<v Speaker 4>You said you didn't want the apple to an</v>
<v Speaker 4>apple.</v>

1096
01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:24.564
<v Speaker 4>I told you what I wanted when I came in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I want to pop corn candy or drink </v>

1097
01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:28.603
<v Speaker 4>for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I made a movie like what is even </v>

1098
01:02:36.631 --> 01:02:39.930
<v Speaker 4>going on in that theater?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they went to a crazy matinee.</v>

1099
01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:41.240
<v Speaker 4>They did go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 8>rummaging through the garbage.</v>

1108
01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:13.870
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1109
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:17.130

<v Speaker 8>popcorn and soft drinks.</v>

1111

<v Speaker 4>So they didn't show up,</v>

1126
01:04:07.791 --> 01:04:09.830
<v Speaker 4>but at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the way out,</v>

1127
01:04:09.831 --> 01:04:11.930
<v Speaker 4>he fills up the popcorn and the sodium </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:19.370
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't find a clip of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

1131
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.770
<v Speaker 4>Well there's the other family that does </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1132
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:24.740
<v Speaker 4>I saw this is important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys might be,</v>

1133
01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:28.010
<v Speaker 4>I might be a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like a borderline freegan.</v>

1134
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:30.560
<v Speaker 4>Freegan yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard of that before?</v>

1135
01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.800
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me about Freegan.</v>

1136
01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.040
<v Speaker 4>Freeganism is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1137
01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:34.933
<v Speaker 4>is people that um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they exclusively are </v>

1138
01:04:38.601 --> 01:04:42.230
<v Speaker 4>always vegetarians or vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>

1139
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:43.363
<v Speaker 4>they have this philosophy that it's okay</v>
<v Speaker 4>to eat anything as long as it is being </v>

1140
01:04:46.761 --> 01:04:47.594
<v Speaker 4>thrown away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a whole diet based off of </v>

1141
01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:53.450
<v Speaker 4>dumpster diving consensually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here was a guy like that in the show?</v>

1142
01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:54.693
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this guy is down for anything </v>

1143
01:04:56.290 --> 01:04:59.630
<v Speaker 4>that's cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this family,</v>

1144
01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:01.130
<v Speaker 4>is it going to last one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I show you guys,</v>

1145
01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:04.970
<v Speaker 4>but I urge you all to buy this on SD and</v>
<v Speaker 4>save that dollar.</v>

1146
01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:10.700
<v Speaker 4>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their house was so wild,</v>

1147
01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:14.570
<v Speaker 4>so he takes his family out once a year </v>
<v Speaker 4>with change.</v>

1148
01:05:14.571 --> 01:05:16.890
<v Speaker 4>He saves all year to treat them for </v>
<v Speaker 4>enduring.</v>

1149
01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:21.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he takes them to a buffet.</v>

1150
01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:24.640
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is wonderful.</v>

1151
01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:31.440
<v Speaker 4>You can imagine the dismay on everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 4>faces up to a Chinese buffet.</v>

1152
01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.353
<v Speaker 9>I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>All I could see was food stacked upon </v>

1153
01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:44.671
<v Speaker 9>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We work with fine dining live in the era</v>

1154
01:05:49.471 --> 01:05:54.471
<v Speaker 9>of the table.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What the legend news.</v>

1155
01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:01.320
<v Speaker 9>You're going to have whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You guys don't seem very lumpy.</v>

1156
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.720
<v Speaker 9>You want to sit and talk and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 9>leave.</v>

1157
01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:13.100
<v Speaker 9>We want to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Want to go to at least give it a try.</v>

1158
01:06:13.101 --> 01:06:18.101
<v Speaker 9>We at least agree to give it a try.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I guess we're hearing his wife's pond</v>

1159
01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:26.850
<v Speaker 4>showed up at the last minute thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>always help them out I guess,</v>

1160
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:27.580
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1161
01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.910
<v Speaker 4>guess I'm aunt Auntie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's coming with us.</v>

1162
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:33.970
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1163
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.793
<v Speaker 4>this guy's a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lack of appreciation and I'm going to </v>

1164
01:06:40.411 --> 01:06:41.640
<v Speaker 4>make sure that everybody's happy.</v>

1165
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:50.543
<v Speaker 9>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 9>cool.</v>

1166
01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:55.430
<v Speaker 9>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's our food.</v>

1167
01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:01.830
<v Speaker 4>The plates on it was going to pay</v>

1168
01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:04.290
<v Speaker 9>for three people,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but there were six of us.</v>

1169
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:06.280
<v Speaker 9>Pay for three.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Delicious.</v>

1170
01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:07.123
<v Speaker 9>I know I got your favorite three plates </v>
<v Speaker 9>if I have more than this number of </v>

1171
01:07:11.191 --> 01:07:16.191
<v Speaker 9>places that you pay for each of us to </v>
<v Speaker 9>get the band is the band.</v>

1172
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:19.703
<v Speaker 9>That was unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was so mortified that he would even </v>

1173
01:07:22.921 --> 01:07:23.754
<v Speaker 9>suggest it.</v>

1174
01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:29.850
<v Speaker 4>So the guy we just washed and this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>does the same thing,</v>

1175
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.983
<v Speaker 4>so at the end of the meal they sharp </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken out doggy bags and then everyone </v>

1176
01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:36.750
<v Speaker 4>in the restaurant who hasn't finished </v>
<v Speaker 4>their food,</v>

1177
01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:41.330
<v Speaker 4>they start hitting them up and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I take this home?</v>

1178
01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.193
<v Speaker 4>That to me was the best part of the show</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know why this guy paid in </v>

1179
01:07:45.331 --> 01:07:46.260
<v Speaker 4>coins too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1180
01:07:46.261 --> 01:07:47.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they don't show them pink.</v>

1181
01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:51.900
<v Speaker 4>He whips out like a panty hose full of </v>
<v Speaker 4>entities is so good.</v>

1182
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:54.450

<v Speaker 4>These clubs don't even do.</v>

1190
01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:20.651
<v Speaker 4>They show justice if I'm being honest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but enough about the funny light hearted</v>

1191
01:08:22.161 --> 01:08:25.670
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's bring it down now.</v>

1192
01:08:25.671 --> 01:08:26.504
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do want to talk about the California </v>

1193
01:08:27.891 --> 01:08:32.891
<v Speaker 4>fires because I have a lot of incredible</v>
<v Speaker 4>footage that I want to show you guys.</v>

1194
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:34.243
<v Speaker 4>It has been so nuts out here like I want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to emphasize how was just one day all </v>

1195
01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:43.700
<v Speaker 4>good and then in that evening on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>news,</v>

1196
01:08:43.730 --> 01:08:46.340
<v Speaker 4>it was like the whole freaking state was</v>
<v Speaker 4>on fire.</v>

1197
01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:52.010
<v Speaker 4>I heard a stat that up north.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the campfire,</v>

1198
01:08:52.011 --> 01:08:53.350
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1199
01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.970
<v Speaker 4>That this fire was spreading at the rate</v>
<v Speaker 4>of one football field.</v>

1200
01:08:57.971 --> 01:08:58.804
<v Speaker 4>A per.</v>

1201
01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say it wrong.</v>

1202
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:08.350
<v Speaker 4>One football field per second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's really?</v>

1203
01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sounds well maybe.</v>

1204
01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:14.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I mean no,</v>

1205
01:09:14.361 --> 01:09:16.640
<v Speaker 4>it's just hard to fathom it going that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fast,</v>

1206
01:09:16.641 --> 01:09:17.474
<v Speaker 4>but I guess that's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it explains then why up north </v>

1207
01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:23.503
<v Speaker 4>especially there's 631 people missing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's a good chance that their </v>

1208
01:09:29.490 --> 01:09:32.420
<v Speaker 4>dads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this fire was moving so fast and</v>

1209
01:09:32.421 --> 01:09:33.254
<v Speaker 4>so furious that people were chilling at </v>
<v Speaker 4>their home or in their car in the </v>

1210
01:09:35.481 --> 01:09:36.314
<v Speaker 4>mountains and didn't even realize they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were in an evacuation zone and then all </v>

1211
01:09:40.201 --> 01:09:41.034
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden you see some ambulance </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming over the ridge and by the time </v>

1212
01:09:43.161 --> 01:09:45.470
<v Speaker 4>you're packed up on your car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fires consumed the whole.</v>

1213
01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:47.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1214
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:51.770
<v Speaker 4>so there's a town up north paradise </v>
<v Speaker 4>paradise.</v>

1215
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:56.890
<v Speaker 4>I do ironically named,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this town,</v>

1216
01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.560
<v Speaker 4>it was really beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love them though with California.</v>

1217
01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:01.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's really beautiful and </v>

1218
01:10:02.691 --> 01:10:03.524
<v Speaker 4>foresty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the state is so dr from a lack of </v>

1219
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.600
<v Speaker 4>rainfall that basically everything's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just ready to go up,</v>

1220
01:10:10.821 --> 01:10:12.860
<v Speaker 4>which is what makes these fires so </v>
<v Speaker 4>severe.</v>

1221
01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.910
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the population was $27,000</v>

1222
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:18.763
<v Speaker 4>and in this city nearly 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>homes and other structures were burned </v>

1223
01:10:22.971 --> 01:10:24.770
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>12,000.</v>

1224
01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:26.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was at 6,000,</v>

1225
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:30.050
<v Speaker 4>like the whole city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1226
01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 4>like a whole city was burned down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>12,000</v>

1227
01:10:34.611 --> 01:10:39.140
<v Speaker 4>homes in other structures and 631 people</v>
<v Speaker 4>on accounted for.</v>

1228
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:41.780
<v Speaker 4>Seven people died in their cars and </v>
<v Speaker 4>paradise.</v>

1229
01:10:41.781 --> 01:10:44.810
<v Speaker 4>The boys was so hot that aluminum wheels</v>
<v Speaker 4>melted.</v>

1230
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:47.083
<v Speaker 4>It burned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It burned in paradise up north of </v>

1231
01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.960
<v Speaker 4>142,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>acres.</v>

1232
01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:57.280
<v Speaker 4>I have no way to fathom what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have some videos I want to show of</v>

1233
01:10:58.881 --> 01:11:03.881
<v Speaker 4>kind of some of these people survived </v>
<v Speaker 4>and were unharmed and we had the,</v>

1234
01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:08.840
<v Speaker 4>there woolsey fire going on in our area </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that one seemed crazy.</v>

1235
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.960
<v Speaker 4>And then once we heard the numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the one in the north,</v>

1236
01:11:11.961 --> 01:11:12.830
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my,</v>

1237
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:16.800
<v Speaker 4>it was way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Destruction there was unbelievable.</v>

1238
01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.280
<v Speaker 4>I think here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because La is so densely populated,</v>

1239
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:25.550
<v Speaker 4>the evacuation here was way crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a hundred and 70,000</v>

1240
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:30.120
<v Speaker 4>people who were under mandatory </v>
<v Speaker 4>evacuation.</v>

1241
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:32.103
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1242
01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:38.090
<v Speaker 4>there were 600 structures destroyed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a three fatalities and this fire and the</v>

1243
01:11:40.501 --> 01:11:42.330
<v Speaker 4>one in La and Ventura County.</v>

1244
01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:44.013
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1245
01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:48.690
<v Speaker 4>I want to show some some footage again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these people that were more.</v>

1246
01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:49.883
<v Speaker 4>Well here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1247
01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.753
<v Speaker 4>that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>According to the stats I have in front </v>

1248
01:11:52.951 --> 01:11:54.360
<v Speaker 4>of me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>correct me if I'm wrong.</v>

1249
01:11:54.361 --> 01:11:56.760
<v Speaker 4>Then those were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1250
01:11:56.761 --> 01:12:00.960
<v Speaker 4>I pulled that from CBS News and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>published it around noon today.</v>

1251
01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:04.620
<v Speaker 4>So it's about as up to date.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me see here.</v>

1252
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:07.230

<v Speaker 4>this stuff is,</v>

1253
01:12:07.231 --> 01:12:10.320

<v Speaker 4>like I can't believe this stuff.</v>

01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:45.683
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spread so fast and so furiously because </v>

1268
01:12:47.761 --> 01:12:49.750
<v Speaker 4>it was so windy all of a sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1269
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:53.150
<v Speaker 4>The Santa Ana winds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like pressure from hot.</v>

1270
01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:54.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how the science works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>

1271
01:12:54.511 --> 01:12:55.344
<v Speaker 4>it gets really windy and really dry and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so this guy could very well just be at </v>

1272
01:12:59.701 --> 01:13:00.534
<v Speaker 4>home not knowing anything is going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then all of a sudden he's trying to </v>

1273
01:13:03.001 --> 01:13:04.740
<v Speaker 4>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here this is what it looks like.</v>

1274
01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.990
<v Speaker 4>You can only imagine how hot it would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that car.</v>

1275
01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:13.830
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people have met their end when </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the car.</v>

1276
01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:16.800
<v Speaker 4>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so horrible.</v>

1277
01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:17.843
<v Speaker 4>So this is one look here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>retard can also just stop at any moment </v>

1278
01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:25.570
<v Speaker 4>because of the lack of oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It like turns off and you get,</v>

1279
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:27.500
<v Speaker 4>you're just stuck there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1280
01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all fine.</v>

1281
01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.160
<v Speaker 4>Really horrifying.</v>

1282
01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:35.613
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1283
01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:38.950
<v Speaker 4>well also trees could fall on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1284
01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.540
<v Speaker 4>I never thought of lack of oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1285
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:44.500
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know which one.</v>

1286
01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:45.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this was from Canaan.</v>

1287
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:46.833
<v Speaker 4>This is right in hills and move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drove up and down this road a million </v>

1288
01:13:51.221 --> 01:13:55.870
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how does that frame up?</v>

1289
01:13:55.871 --> 01:13:57.300
<v Speaker 4>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1290
01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:58.143
<v Speaker 4>looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's driving what is usually a really </v>

1291
01:14:02.411 --> 01:14:05.590
<v Speaker 4>beautiful and scenic road down to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beach,</v>

1292
01:14:05.591 --> 01:14:09.490
<v Speaker 4>down to Malibu and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1293
01:14:09.491 --> 01:14:12.730
<v Speaker 4>that's the Canon tunnel that drive some </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the time.</v>

1294
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.653
<v Speaker 4>So she's going through a tunnel on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground and as she emerges on the other </v>

1295
01:14:15.881 --> 01:14:19.900
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see the amber red go low stretch</v>

1296
01:14:19.901 --> 01:14:20.734
<v Speaker 4>through a merge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She comes out of the tunnel and it's </v>

1297
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:25.023
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>

1298
01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:27.253
<v Speaker 5>that's such a scary drive to do it in </v>
<v Speaker 5>such a time because it's like you drive </v>

1299
01:14:30.711 --> 01:14:31.570
<v Speaker 5>to the mountains.</v>

1300
01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.480
<v Speaker 4>There's already they started going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1301
01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:37.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1302
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:40.783
<v Speaker 9>My.</v>

1303
01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:43.853
<v Speaker 4>It's just smoke and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amber asked the visibility's lift one </v>

1304
01:14:46.201 --> 01:14:49.470
<v Speaker 4>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to hear the.</v>

1305
01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:51.970
<v Speaker 4>You can hear the crackling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1306
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:53.873
<v Speaker 4>How the hell did she record this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That blows my mind that she was able to </v>

1307
01:14:58.681 --> 01:15:00.570
<v Speaker 4>drive and recording the wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1308
01:15:00.571 --> 01:15:03.150
<v Speaker 4>and got her phone in the same hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1309
01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.153
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then so it looks like she's out </v>

1310
01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:06.623
<v Speaker 4>because she's in another tunnel and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's coming out and then once again on </v>

1311
01:15:10.231 --> 01:15:11.064
<v Speaker 4>the other side of the tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just endless fire and ash and </v>

1312
01:15:14.431 --> 01:15:17.520
<v Speaker 4>smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She opens the window.</v>

1313
01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:18.413
<v Speaker 4>You hear that</v>

1314
01:15:33.650 --> 01:15:37.340
<v Speaker 5>that is the worst road to be on at this </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1315
01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.353
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so scary driving on a regular because </v>

1316
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:44.210
<v Speaker 5>it's so twist and turn and mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

1317
01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm amazed that she was able to record </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1318
01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:51.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can you.</v>

1319
01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't watched if,</v>

1320
01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:03.030
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what she makes her.</v>

1321
01:16:03.031 --> 01:16:03.990
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's fine.</v>

1322
01:16:03.991 --> 01:16:08.520
<v Speaker 4>I saw an interview with her afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's laughing about the experience.</v>

1323
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:09.570
<v Speaker 4>She's totally fine.</v>

1324
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.823
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1325
01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.830
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't wish that experience on anyone.</v>

1326
01:16:13.831 --> 01:16:16.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is so terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1327
01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:19.770
<v Speaker 4>but my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she is a hero for.</v>

1328
01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:21.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine you're driving for your life and</v>

1329
01:16:21.751 --> 01:16:23.550
<v Speaker 4>holding a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recording it on one hand.</v>

1330
01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:25.803
<v Speaker 4>That's something she needs to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>professional camera lady or something </v>

1331
01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.150
<v Speaker 4>because she's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's got potential.</v>

1332
01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible stuff.</v>

1333
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.540
<v Speaker 4>Canaan is a landmark in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is beautiful,</v>

1334
01:16:39.570 --> 01:16:42.300
<v Speaker 4>really beautiful canyon road that goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>down to Malibu beach.</v>

1335
01:16:42.301 --> 01:16:47.301
<v Speaker 4>So it's weird to think of it from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful scenic route too.</v>

1336
01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:54.630
<v Speaker 4>A hell fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's more yet.</v>

1337
01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll have we here.</v>

1338
01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:00.690
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just thought this was so crazy.</v>

1339
01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:05.220
<v Speaker 4>Here you can see that the freeway full </v>
<v Speaker 4>of cars,</v>

1340
01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:06.563
<v Speaker 4>fire creeping up the side of the cliff </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then a helicopter dumping water on </v>

1341
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:14.810
<v Speaker 4>the freeway as cars are still on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>freeway.</v>

1342
01:17:14.811 --> 01:17:15.644
<v Speaker 4>I mean the fire spread so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't even have time to shut down </v>

1343
01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:21.210
<v Speaker 4>the freeway and evacuated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can see these people.</v>

1344
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:24.430
<v Speaker 4>You'll see I'm playing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievable.</v>

1345
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

1346
01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.313
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Helicopter is literally dropping water </v>

1347
01:17:30.850 --> 01:17:31.683
<v Speaker 4>on cars on the freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if we're going to stay from </v>

1348
01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:38.954
<v Speaker 4>getting hammered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we probably want to imagine being in </v>

1349
01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:41.570
<v Speaker 4>that car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just like,</v>

1350
01:17:41.571 --> 01:17:42.404
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1351
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.590
<v Speaker 4>And the worst part is that people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopping the look.</v>

1352
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:50.030
<v Speaker 4>So there's traffic like stop and go </v>
<v Speaker 4>traffic or right next to the fire.</v>

1353
01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:52.990
<v Speaker 4>Why would you stop?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you stop?</v>

1354
01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:56.840
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it looks like what you see this.</v>

1355
01:17:56.841 --> 01:18:00.560
<v Speaker 4>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all right next to the fire.</v>

1356
01:18:00.561 --> 01:18:01.820
<v Speaker 4>Just stop and go traffic.</v>

1357
01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.110
<v Speaker 4>It's just because they've always done </v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

1358
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:07.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right there.</v>

1359
01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:15.240
<v Speaker 4>Who that is so fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's just a testament.</v>

1360
01:18:15.241 --> 01:18:18.330
<v Speaker 4>Thou fastest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A spread.</v>

1361
01:18:18.331 --> 01:18:21.210

<v Speaker 4>freeway.</v>

1362
01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a guy actually splashed,</v>

1363
01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.880
<v Speaker 4>drifted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could see where it was going to drift</v>

1364
01:18:26.881 --> 01:18:29.340
<v Speaker 4>because of the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

1365
01:18:29.341 --> 01:18:34.341
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I do want to say I was up at 5:00</v>

1366
01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:35.673
<v Speaker 4>AM the night that it broke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these firefighters are freaking </v>

1367
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:39.423
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like being a firefighter in California </v>

1368
01:18:41.831 --> 01:18:45.550
<v Speaker 4>or any firefighters are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot of respect for firefighters</v>

1369
01:18:45.551 --> 01:18:49.690
<v Speaker 4>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but these guys were grinding it out.</v>

1370
01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:50.703
<v Speaker 4>Five am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm raging and Friday and they're out </v>

<v Speaker 4>an,</v>

1374
01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:04.023
<v Speaker 4>a profound appreciation for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there was a lot of police involved </v>

1375
01:19:08.261 --> 01:19:09.100
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of</v>

1376
01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.040
<v Speaker 4>I saw a clip of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and dude I know they say you're supposed</v>

1377

<v Speaker 4>to evacuate and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I saw a dude,</v>

1378
01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.713
<v Speaker 4>he had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looked like a pretty poor house and </v>

1379

<v Speaker 4>you'd like a farm and animals and shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and his whole neighborhood.</v>

<v Speaker 4>not last night when it was happening and</v>

1381
01:19:27.491 --> 01:19:30.560

<v Speaker 4>flames and the dude is just there with a</v>

1382
01:19:30.561 --> 01:19:35.561
<v Speaker 4>garden hose putting out ambers and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked like he saved his house man.</v>

1383
01:19:36.231 --> 01:19:40.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was just there with a fricking</v>
<v Speaker 4>garden hose,</v>

1384
01:19:40.851 --> 01:19:45.851
<v Speaker 4>like against this force of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm a huge respect for these fricking</v>

1385
01:19:49.401 --> 01:19:52.550
<v Speaker 4>amazing people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even now the fire is still going,</v>

1386
01:19:52.551 --> 01:19:54.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1387
01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:55.480
<v Speaker 4>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still I,</v>

1388
01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.870
<v Speaker 4>I could be wrong band.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like what?</v>

1389
01:19:56.871 --> 01:20:01.871
<v Speaker 4>Sixty contained or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one close to us.</v>

1390
01:20:03.111 --> 01:20:03.741
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1391
01:20:03.741 --> 01:20:06.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean the one up north is still raging </v>
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>

1392
01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 4>So that's what you,</v>

1393
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:08.933
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like now the kind of the dust has </v>

1394
01:20:11.191 --> 01:20:12.024
<v Speaker 5>settled in the city as fires still </v>
<v Speaker 5>raging on and these guys are still </v>

1395
01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:16.824
<v Speaker 5>fighting it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just can't imagine that moment you </v>

1396
01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:23.900
<v Speaker 5>come back to your house and it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where do you start in?</v>

1397
01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:25.750
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

1398
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:27.020
<v Speaker 5>It just look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was he fired?</v>

1399
01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:29.330
<v Speaker 5>That is 70 percent contained.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1400
01:20:29.331 --> 01:20:30.980
<v Speaker 5>the one up north,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the campfire.</v>

1401
01:20:31.050 --> 01:20:34.220
<v Speaker 5>A only 45 percent contain still.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gosh,</v>

1402
01:20:34.221 --> 01:20:35.054
<v Speaker 5>Gee Whiz.</v>

1403
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:43.550
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many really luxurious,</v>

1404
01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:46.970
<v Speaker 5>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>expensive houses burned down la,</v>

1405
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:52.500
<v Speaker 5>like architecture and art and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and whatnot.</v>

1406
01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.360
<v Speaker 5>Like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard that.</v>

1407
01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.213
<v Speaker 5>I hadn't heard if uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it had been confirmed whether or not </v>

1408
01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.160
<v Speaker 5>his house survived,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the director,</v>

1409
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.580
<v Speaker 5>Guillermo del Toro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you'll,</v>

1410
01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:07.320
<v Speaker 5>I know you're a huge fan of guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>

1411
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:09.570
<v Speaker 5>he has a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a huge,</v>

1412
01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.433
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has a huge private collection of </v>

1413
01:21:12.211 --> 01:21:15.480
<v Speaker 5>artwork from a lot of really famous </v>
<v Speaker 5>artists that in his house.</v>

1414
01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:18.060
<v Speaker 5>And last thing I thought about when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>heard about all day,</v>

1415
01:21:18.061 --> 01:21:20.130
<v Speaker 5>like I think it burnt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I heard of Brian,</v>

1416
01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.920
<v Speaker 5>did he not?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's me.</v>

1417
01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.910
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because he had,</v>

1418
01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.810
<v Speaker 5>he had a bunch of really awesome pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might be wrong about that.</v>

1419
01:21:27.811 --> 01:21:29.430
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you guys can fact check that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm curious.</v>

1420
01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.031
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look it up.</v>

1421
01:21:30.031 --> 01:21:30.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1422
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:32.340
<v Speaker 5>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as of a day or two,</v>

1423
01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:34.260
<v Speaker 5>it's only minor smoke damage.</v>

1424
01:21:35.150 --> 01:21:35.983
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You miley cyrus lost or have a lot of </v>

1425
01:21:40.051 --> 01:21:40.884
<v Speaker 5>super rich people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is good in a way that because </v>

1426
01:21:42.871 --> 01:21:45.830
<v Speaker 5>these are people that can take it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on the other good,</v>

1427
01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.440
<v Speaker 5>but they can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well there their lives are not ruined,</v>

1428
01:21:49.441 --> 01:21:50.274
<v Speaker 5>but that's not to dismiss the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they'll surely endure from losing </v>

1429
01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.720
<v Speaker 5>all of their worldly belongings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Horrible.</v>

1430
01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine?</v>

1431
01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.073
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Kanya Kanya hired private </v>

1432
01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:10.570
<v Speaker 5>firefighters to watch his house and </v>
<v Speaker 5>protect his house,</v>

1433
01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:11.733
<v Speaker 5>which was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God bless him in his neighbors to </v>

1434
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:18.490
<v Speaker 5>evidently which,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the neighbors were thankful for</v>

1435
01:22:18.491 --> 01:22:20.900
<v Speaker 5>him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was his own.</v>

1436
01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:22.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I meant is that he,</v>

1437
01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:26.890
<v Speaker 5>he not just to protect us but to protect</v>
<v Speaker 5>his whole neighborhood.</v>

1438
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know you could do that,</v>

1439
01:22:28.771 --> 01:22:33.300
<v Speaker 5>but I mean that's a little private </v>
<v Speaker 5>firefighters.</v>

1440
01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:36.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems 30 old thing.</v>

1441
01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:38.700
<v Speaker 5>There was saying his house is worth $6 </v>
<v Speaker 5>million.</v>

1442
01:22:38.701 --> 01:22:41.430
<v Speaker 5>So I think when you have found much to </v>
<v Speaker 5>protect,</v>

1443
01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:44.820
<v Speaker 5>well you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're saying what other people's houses</v>

1444
01:22:44.821 --> 01:22:46.540
<v Speaker 5>are burning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1445
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:47.510
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1446
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.730
<v Speaker 5>you can't afford the private </v>
<v Speaker 5>firefighters see your house burns.</v>

1447
01:22:50.731 --> 01:22:52.110
<v Speaker 5>Is that really fair?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1448
01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:53.163
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well world isn't fair and army of </v>

1449
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:56.640
<v Speaker 5>firefighters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Goddammit.</v>

1450
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:59.820
<v Speaker 5>You go for it apparently though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>saved this whole neighborhood.</v>

1451
01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.571
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1452
01:23:00.571 --> 01:23:01.090
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>

1453
01:23:01.090 --> 01:23:01.923
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That probably helped the firefighters a </v>

1454
01:23:03.331 --> 01:23:05.230
<v Speaker 5>lot because they didn't have to come.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

1455
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 5>Fucking waste</v>

1456
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:06.873
<v Speaker 4>resources on.</v>

1457
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:09.340
<v Speaker 5>I guess my thought is just how these </v>
<v Speaker 5>private firefighters,</v>

1458
01:23:09.341 --> 01:23:11.300
<v Speaker 5>if nobody pays them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do they just stay at home?</v>

1459
01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:12.860
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I'm in bed.</v>

1460
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:17.910
<v Speaker 4>They're probably not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>firefighters just like I'm right now.</v>

1461
01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:20.810
<v Speaker 4>It's probably like ex military kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1462
01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.140
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had the same.</v>

1463
01:23:23.141 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 4>I had the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does sound weird.</v>

1464
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:29.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying not to be cynical about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because my first impression was like,</v>

1465
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1466
01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what,</v>

1467
01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:35.170
<v Speaker 4>you must be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But on the other hand it's like,</v>

1468
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.670
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you got the money,</v>

1469
01:23:36.671 --> 01:23:38.170
<v Speaker 4>if you got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've got it,</v>

1470
01:23:38.171 --> 01:23:40.030
<v Speaker 4>flaunt it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh for sure.</v>

1471
01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:42.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't blame Kanye for doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hell yeah,</v>

1472
01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:43.323
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet you in the end it probably did </v>

1473
01:23:44.231 --> 01:23:46.970
<v Speaker 4>help the firefighters a lot because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have to worry about saving that.</v>

1474
01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:51.180
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>start with my house.</v>

1475
01:23:52.290 --> 01:23:54.390
<v Speaker 4>But then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>help other people if you can,</v>

1476
01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:57.513
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to say I don't like talking about </v>

1477
01:23:58.901 --> 01:23:59.734
<v Speaker 4>politics and I don't like talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump and I'm not a forest ranger </v>

1478
01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.353
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know how to analyze this </v>

1479
01:24:08.051 --> 01:24:08.990
<v Speaker 4>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1480
01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:13.010
<v Speaker 4>the validity of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But trump's first response and,</v>

1481
01:24:13.011 --> 01:24:17.950
<v Speaker 4>and as someone that lives here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to read this to you,</v>

1482
01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.353
<v Speaker 4>there is no reason for these massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>deadly and costly forest fires in </v>

1483
01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.050
<v Speaker 4>California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1484
01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.990
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no reason is this better?</v>

1485
01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.453
<v Speaker 4>Much better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason for these massive </v>

1486
01:24:28.961 --> 01:24:32.320
<v Speaker 4>deadly and costly forest fires in </v>
<v Speaker 4>California except that forest management</v>

1487
01:24:32.321 --> 01:24:33.154
<v Speaker 4>is so poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Billions of dollars that are given each </v>

1488
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.943
<v Speaker 4>year with so many lives lost all because</v>
<v Speaker 4>of gross mismanagement of the forest </v>

1489
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.620
<v Speaker 4>remedy now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or no more federal payments.</v>

1490
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:42.993
<v Speaker 4>This was his first statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did end up saying a lot of Nice </v>

1491
01:24:44.981 --> 01:24:47.820
<v Speaker 4>things and encouraging stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1492
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:48.663
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a park ranger so I can't assess </v>

1493
01:24:51.641 --> 01:24:53.590
<v Speaker 4>his statements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1494
01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:57.360
<v Speaker 5>all of that might be completely and </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfectly valid.</v>

1495
01:24:57.361 --> 01:25:01.710
<v Speaker 5>Right up to that last sentence where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>suddenly threatened pulling funding,</v>

1496
01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:02.573
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1497
01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.110
<v Speaker 5>have that fight after work where we've </v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped the fires maybe.</v>

1498
01:25:07.111 --> 01:25:07.810
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1499
01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:08.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

1500
01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:10.000
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my problem was just like,</v>

1501
01:25:10.001 --> 01:25:12.690
<v Speaker 4>as someone that lives here is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

1502
01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.030
<v Speaker 4>I feel like the world needs a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>more tenderness,</v>

1503
01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:19.510
<v Speaker 4>more compact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little more compassion right now.</v>

1504
01:25:19.511 --> 01:25:22.740
<v Speaker 4>And especially in these times when we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>so divided and everything.</v>

1505
01:25:22.770 --> 01:25:23.603
<v Speaker 4>So political and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just felt disappointed that our </v>

1506
01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:31.831
<v Speaker 4>president was making a political point </v>
<v Speaker 4>or using it to make a point or to attack</v>

1507
01:25:32.591 --> 01:25:34.800
<v Speaker 4>people when people's houses were still </v>
<v Speaker 4>borrowing the bore.</v>

1508
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:37.840
<v Speaker 4>Dying and fires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>

1509
01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:38.441
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1510
01:25:38.441 --> 01:25:39.640
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might be right.</v>

1511
01:25:39.641 --> 01:25:43.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even going to get until trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to analyze who's right and who's wrong,</v>

1512
01:25:43.031 --> 01:25:43.864
<v Speaker 4>but I just wish that there was more </v>
<v Speaker 4>fricking tenderness and compassion and </v>

1513
01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:49.720
<v Speaker 4>the planet for each other.</v>

1514
01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:51.041
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1515
01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:51.874
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there may be a lot of validity to </v>

1516
01:25:54.611 --> 01:25:57.400
<v Speaker 5>what he's saying about mismanagement and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1517
01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:00.970
<v Speaker 5>things that can prevent it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when it's an ongoing disaster,</v>

1518
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:01.833
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not over like people are still </v>

1519
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 5>dying and it's</v>

1520
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.843
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

1521
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>next month,</v>

1522
01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.030
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about what we can do better.</v>

1523
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:13.760
<v Speaker 4>And Donald trump really is a role model </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people,</v>

1524
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:19.220
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people look up to and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ambulance came and I just think,</v>

1525
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:22.423
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be nice to see more compassionate </v>

1526
01:26:23.601 --> 01:26:27.110
<v Speaker 4>in the world unless of whatever this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>

1527
01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:29.563
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought it was relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a little disappointed by buyer </v>

1528
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:35.000
<v Speaker 4>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's,</v>

1529
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:37.820
<v Speaker 4>he leads all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just his base.</v>

1530
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:39.163
<v Speaker 4>He's still the president of California </v>
<v Speaker 4>even though Californians hate him in </v>

1531
01:26:43.611 --> 01:26:44.444
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>

1532
01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.433
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

1533
01:26:47.230 --> 01:26:48.960
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1534
01:26:51.190 --> 01:26:52.023
<v Speaker 4>I definitely am going to donate to </v>
<v Speaker 4>support the people that have been </v>

1535
01:26:55.001 --> 01:26:55.834
<v Speaker 4>affected by this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to research the best place </v>

1536
01:26:57.851 --> 01:27:00.520
<v Speaker 4>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The mayor of Sacramento,</v>

1537
01:27:00.521 --> 01:27:05.521
<v Speaker 4>which is the capital of California and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just south of um,</v>

1538
01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:09.790
<v Speaker 4>this really incredible fire up north,</v>

1539
01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:12.523
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1540
01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.180
<v Speaker 4>straight from the horse's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that derogatory?</v>

1541
01:27:16.210 --> 01:27:17.043
<v Speaker 4>Is that a relevant thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The horse's mouth gets horses shit </v>

1542
01:27:22.150 --> 01:27:25.900
<v Speaker 4>straight from the mayor's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to help the victims,</v>

1543
01:27:25.901 --> 01:27:29.860
<v Speaker 4>please don't send supplies as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>evacuation center.</v>

1544
01:27:29.861 --> 01:27:30.694
<v Speaker 4>Say they have been in undated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those working on the front line and say </v>

1545
01:27:33.791 --> 01:27:38.791
<v Speaker 4>that giving to the Red Cross or habitat </v>
<v Speaker 4>a.org</v>

1546
01:27:38.801 --> 01:27:39.634
<v Speaker 4>is the best way to help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these are some good recommendations </v>

1547
01:27:43.511 --> 01:27:44.344
<v Speaker 4>from someone directly involved in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>to give you some ideas if you want to </v>

1548
01:27:47.621 --> 01:27:50.200
<v Speaker 4>help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely going to donate myself.</v>

1549
01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:55.810
<v Speaker 4>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just feel awful for everyone.</v>

1550
01:27:56.610 --> 01:27:58.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

1551
01:27:58.110 --> 01:27:59.060
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1552
01:27:59.180 --> 01:27:59.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1553
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:02.380
<v Speaker 4>this thing going on a coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These wildfires are just.</v>

1554
01:28:02.381 --> 01:28:04.990
<v Speaker 4>So they've gotten so out of control </v>
<v Speaker 4>every season.</v>

1555
01:28:05.710 --> 01:28:08.680
<v Speaker 4>I was watching a documentary on Netflix </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was really interesting about it,</v>

1556
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:11.440
<v Speaker 4>about the guy who's been following.</v>

1557
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:13.630
<v Speaker 4>I forget the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you can look it up for me when you</v>

1558
01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:14.473
<v Speaker 4>guys and out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about a documentary crew that </v>

1559
01:28:16.511 --> 01:28:17.344
<v Speaker 4>follows firefighters over the course of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a whole fire season and the </v>

1560
01:28:21.641 --> 01:28:24.280
<v Speaker 4>firefighters are saying that in the past</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 10,</v>

1561
01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.473
<v Speaker 4>15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been getting progressively worse </v>

1562
01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:28.893
<v Speaker 4>and the season's been getting longer </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's the change in weather </v>

1563
01:28:33.401 --> 01:28:34.234
<v Speaker 4>and the changing climate has a produced </v>
<v Speaker 4>the less rain in California and so </v>

1564
01:28:39.401 --> 01:28:44.401
<v Speaker 4>everything's more dry and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>making the fire is way worse.</v>

1565
01:28:45.311 --> 01:28:46.144
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of dead trees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of dry trees and </v>

1566
01:28:49.211 --> 01:28:50.950
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a ton of wilderness.</v>

1567
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:52.583
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's incense from due to the change </v>

1568
01:28:57.401 --> 01:29:00.520
<v Speaker 4>in weather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a huge matchbox,</v>

1569
01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:03.170
<v Speaker 4>just a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1570
01:29:03.210 --> 01:29:07.140
<v Speaker 4>so every season like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one now la.</v>

1571
01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fire chasers.</v>

1572
01:29:08.251 --> 01:29:09.360
<v Speaker 4>Thank you Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On netflix.</v>

1573
01:29:09.361 --> 01:29:11.040
<v Speaker 4>It was really captivating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch.</v>

1574
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:13.530
<v Speaker 4>I gotta watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incredible footage.</v>

1575
01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:18.030
<v Speaker 4>Last year the one in Ventura was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>worst in history.</v>

1576
01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:21.630
<v Speaker 4>It was the most destructive in </v>
<v Speaker 4>California history.</v>

1577
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:22.583
<v Speaker 4>And now this year the one up north beat </v>
<v Speaker 4>that record already and it's still </v>

1578
01:29:25.111 --> 01:29:29.590
<v Speaker 4>burning Ventura county.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's going on.</v>

1579
01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.490
<v Speaker 4>Those poor guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1580
01:29:30.491 --> 01:29:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm from Ventura originally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just getting crushed.</v>

1581
01:29:33.581 --> 01:29:34.414
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel so bad for them to fires </v>

1582
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:37.143
<v Speaker 4>shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had that shooting and the next </v>

1583
01:29:39.911 --> 01:29:43.630
<v Speaker 4>night before they can even mourn for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>loss of like 11 lives.</v>

1584
01:29:43.631 --> 01:29:47.290
<v Speaker 4>I think it was 12 lines that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1585
01:29:47.630 --> 01:29:50.080
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fricking counties on fire,</v>

1586
01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:53.500
<v Speaker 4>same people that needed to more and had </v>
<v Speaker 4>to evacuate.</v>

1587
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:54.423
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

1588
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:56.343
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

1589
01:29:58.560 --> 01:29:59.393
<v Speaker 1>Rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably if I had the guests are a </v>

1590
01:30:00.791 --> 01:30:05.550
<v Speaker 1>result of all the gay people bringing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrath of God.</v>

1591
01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1592
01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:09.273
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like all these preachers that </v>

1593
01:30:10.321 --> 01:30:14.220
<v Speaker 1>say all the fires and everything bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the world is because of gay</v>

1594
01:30:14.221 --> 01:30:15.970
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

1595
01:30:16.050 --> 01:30:19.770
<v Speaker 1>go Westborough Westborough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people like,</v>

1596
01:30:19.771 --> 01:30:20.604
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1597
01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:24.670
<v Speaker 1>more reputable than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people with actual.</v>

1598
01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to look into the specifics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because I don't want to say anything.</v>

1599
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Not True,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen lots of clips of preachers</v>

1600
01:30:32.561 --> 01:30:33.560
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1601
01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:38.300
<v Speaker 1>all the fires out here in California is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the gays.</v>

1602
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Eh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1603
01:30:41.021 --> 01:30:43.660
<v Speaker 1>when you rub dicks together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you expect to happen?</v>

1604
01:30:44.170 --> 01:30:48.810
<v Speaker 1>When you rub two sticks together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it causes more than just semen to erupt.</v>

1605
01:30:48.811 --> 01:30:53.811
<v Speaker 1>It causes sparks like sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two sticks rubbing together.</v>

1606
01:30:54.401 --> 01:30:55.330
<v Speaker 1>God said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1607
01:30:56.460 --> 01:31:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I rub two big sticks and a whole fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>burned estate down.</v>

1608
01:31:00.011 --> 01:31:02.620
<v Speaker 1>If that ain't the got gazed and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what it is.</v>

1609
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:09.870
<v Speaker 1>That's why God says use Lube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you rubbed Dick Dry,</v>

1610
01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:12.030
<v Speaker 1>you could burn the whole state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1611
01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:14.070
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about.</v>

1612
01:31:14.071 --> 01:31:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I said something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1613
01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Ilos got where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pastor.</v>

1614
01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Blame scalpel all over this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1615
01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:25.440
<v Speaker 1>A pasture blames California offers on </v>
<v Speaker 1>states embrace me of Lgbtq Center.</v>

1616
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:28.343
<v Speaker 1>A reasonable stance right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now trump says that it's because of the </v>

1617
01:31:32.251 --> 01:31:36.030
<v Speaker 1>poor forest management and the liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>ses because of climate change,</v>

1618
01:31:36.031 --> 01:31:36.864
<v Speaker 1>but I have an alternate theory that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a that gaze when two men rob dix </v>

1619
01:31:45.631 --> 01:31:48.060
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can cause more than just ejaculate</v>

1620
01:31:50.230 --> 01:31:52.900
<v Speaker 1>known for inflammatory claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pasture.</v>

1621
01:31:52.901 --> 01:31:53.734
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Swanson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little subtle upon their inflammatory </v>

1622
01:31:57.101 --> 01:32:00.340
<v Speaker 1>claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it is a little fun with it.</v>

1623
01:32:00.341 --> 01:32:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pasture.</v>

1624
01:32:01.570 --> 01:32:02.403
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Swanson is drawing a link between </v>
<v Speaker 1>California's devastating wildfires and </v>

1625
01:32:06.191 --> 01:32:09.070
<v Speaker 1>the states embrace of same sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriages.</v>

1626
01:32:10.330 --> 01:32:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds foolproof.</v>

1627
01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Wrap it up with God's punishment of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Golden State for legitimizing the sin of</v>

1628
01:32:19.571 --> 01:32:20.404
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine being God and you hate gay </v>

1629
01:32:21.611 --> 01:32:22.444
<v Speaker 1>people that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Gay God must be really closeted or </v>

1630
01:32:27.071 --> 01:32:29.290
<v Speaker 1>something because he hates gays like way</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>

1631
01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:34.270
<v Speaker 1>The first gay pride March occurred in </v>
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco in 1970,</v>

1632
01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:38.020
<v Speaker 1>and then San Francisco legitimize </v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality in 1972.</v>

1633
01:32:38.021 --> 01:32:38.854
<v Speaker 1>He said in 2005 California state </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislators became the first state in </v>

1634
01:32:42.551 --> 01:32:44.530
<v Speaker 1>the nation to pass the same sex marriage</v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

1635
01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1636
01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:50.640
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to have to draw more correlation</v>

1637
01:32:50.641 --> 01:32:55.080
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is Jim Baker's?</v>

1638
01:32:55.081 --> 01:33:00.081
<v Speaker 1>Zach priest was similar views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1641
01:33:05.490 --> 01:33:06.323

<v Speaker 1>now a lot of people say that climate </v>

1642
01:33:10.561 --> 01:33:11.394
<v Speaker 1>change is making the state dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I say is that it's drag </v>

1643
01:33:14.551 --> 01:33:19.551
<v Speaker 1>butthole that's causing a fires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I say is that the gay people,</v>

1644
01:33:19.741 --> 01:33:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I haven't way too much fun and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>causing all these Dang fys.</v>

1645
01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Please donate to my church because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed another private jet.</v>

1646
01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else we got here?</v>

1647
01:33:37.241 --> 01:33:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Folks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got,</v>

1648
01:33:38.410 --> 01:33:42.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the F we got,</v>

1649
01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:46.840
<v Speaker 1>men with beards are more attractive than</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who are clean shaven,</v>

1650
01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:52.060
<v Speaker 1>really real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who study finds hung.</v>

1651
01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you found that to be the case?</v>

1652
01:33:54.671 --> 01:33:58.490
<v Speaker 1>You seem shocked by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1653
01:33:58.530 --> 01:33:59.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us as having a beard that helps </v>

1654
01:34:02.291 --> 01:34:04.960
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are statistical outliers I guess.</v>

1655
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just imagine how bad,</v>

1656
01:34:07.090 --> 01:34:10.870
<v Speaker 1>how rough it'd be if you were shaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1657
01:34:10.871 --> 01:34:12.160
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

1658
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you gone,</v>

1659
01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:15.320
<v Speaker 1>have you been beard lists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1660
01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:19.390
<v Speaker 1>in the past and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be honest,</v>

1661
01:34:19.630 --> 01:34:23.980
<v Speaker 1>very rarely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not since I was a teenager.</v>

1662
01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:24.814
<v Speaker 1>Basically I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a beard while I was </v>

1663
01:34:26.150 --> 01:34:26.983
<v Speaker 1>continuously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a beard pretty much since I </v>

1664
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:31.383
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you that when I clean </v>

1665
01:34:33.641 --> 01:34:36.390
<v Speaker 1>shave I feel like a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel good.</v>

1666
01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I also really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'll come to kiss me or something,</v>

1667
01:34:41.621 --> 01:34:44.980
<v Speaker 1>it feels horrible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want your perfectly,</v>

1668
01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:47.830
<v Speaker 1>it becomes like sandpaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it,</v>

1669
01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real ticket from it,</v>

1670
01:34:51.851 --> 01:34:54.220
<v Speaker 1>well this guy's handsome as fuck with or</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a beard.</v>

1671
01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:55.930
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1672
01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 1>a guy like me on be like,</v>

1673
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:01.350
<v Speaker 5>here he is with no like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for me personally,</v>

1674
01:35:01.410 --> 01:35:05.150
<v Speaker 5>they did a study and they showed how </v>
<v Speaker 5>much are you likely to want to fuck this</v>

1675
01:35:05.151 --> 01:35:08.750
<v Speaker 5>guy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just showed people probably,</v>

1676
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:10.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>random guys.</v>

1677
01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:13.580
<v Speaker 4>But I do think in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beard,</v>

1678
01:35:13.610 --> 01:35:17.630
<v Speaker 4>it just hides my face and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be honest and it's fine.</v>

1679
01:35:17.631 --> 01:35:19.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that insecure about how ugly I </v>
<v Speaker 4>am.</v>

1680
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.480
<v Speaker 4>That is one thing I'm comfortable with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you criticize me I'll shut down.</v>

1681
01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:26.023
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1682
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:27.920
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's what it is.</v>

1683
01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:29.470
<v Speaker 4>Covers my face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I to,</v>

1684
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:31.260
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my details are not that good.</v>

1685
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:35.880
<v Speaker 4>I've got a tiny chin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got chubby cheeks.</v>

1686
01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:38.190
<v Speaker 4>Everything going on here is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful.</v>

1687
01:35:38.191 --> 01:35:39.024
<v Speaker 4>Chiseled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't look like superman or wherever </v>

1688
01:35:40.051 --> 01:35:40.884
<v Speaker 4>this ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the 50 shades covered as much as </v>

1689
01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:44.580
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can see my nose,</v>

1690
01:35:44.581 --> 01:35:45.660
<v Speaker 4>my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my eyebrows.</v>

1691
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:46.740
<v Speaker 4>That's okay.</v>

1692
01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:51.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I agree with the.</v>

1693
01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:53.573
<v Speaker 5>Went to stay with the premise of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think I look better with a </v>

1694
01:35:56.191 --> 01:35:57.070
<v Speaker 5>beard?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1695
01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.490
<v Speaker 5>And it looks horrified when I shave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1696
01:35:59.491 --> 01:36:01.040
<v Speaker 5>I think that about everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1697
01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:03.930
<v Speaker 5>I think I do think that it looks better </v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

1698
01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:07.980
<v Speaker 5>and I don't like a longer beard though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I know there's a certain point.</v>

1699
01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:08.963
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's actually what the study found to </v>

1700
01:36:09.511 --> 01:36:10.021
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1701
01:36:10.021 --> 01:36:11.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1702
01:36:11.150 --> 01:36:12.730
<v Speaker 5>they check about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will.</v>

1703
01:36:12.731 --> 01:36:13.540
<v Speaker 5>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me read.</v>

1704
01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:14.161
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1705
01:36:14.161 --> 01:36:16.470
<v Speaker 5>there's four tiers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like clean shaven,</v>

1706
01:36:16.530 --> 01:36:18.810
<v Speaker 5>a little bit of stubble,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a decent amount of stubble.</v>

1707
01:36:18.811 --> 01:36:21.480
<v Speaker 5>And then like a full beard and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>decent amount of stubble,</v>

1708
01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:23.220
<v Speaker 5>which I think was 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No shaving.</v>

1709
01:36:23.250 --> 01:36:26.830
<v Speaker 5>That was the sexiness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me read this for you guys.</v>

1710
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.010
<v Speaker 4>Men who have full beards are seen as </v>
<v Speaker 4>more attractive than men who have just a</v>

1711
01:36:31.011 --> 01:36:34.880
<v Speaker 4>light stubble according to results of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>new study that don't say what this study</v>

1712
01:36:34.881 --> 01:36:35.714
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know if it's a reputable in </v>

1713
01:36:36.921 --> 01:36:38.990
<v Speaker 4>any way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it makes sense.</v>

1714
01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.093
<v Speaker 4>Researchers found the widely celebrated </v>
<v Speaker 4>attractiveness of bearded stars like </v>

1715
01:36:43.851 --> 01:36:47.060
<v Speaker 4>Jamie Dorman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jake Gyllenhaal,</v>

1716
01:36:47.061 --> 01:36:49.670
<v Speaker 4>and Chris Hemsworth is apparently no </v>
<v Speaker 4>coincidence.</v>

1717
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.480
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't hurt that they're incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 5>handsome as well.</v>

1718
01:36:53.481 --> 01:36:54.314
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The most beautiful men in the world are </v>

1719
01:36:56.421 --> 01:36:57.254
<v Speaker 5>found a track,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although could that be a cultural </v>

1720
01:36:59.601 --> 01:37:01.160
<v Speaker 5>phenomenon because I feel like in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fifties,</v>

1721
01:37:01.161 --> 01:37:04.220
<v Speaker 5>having a beard was seen as kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>trend.</v>

1722
01:37:04.221 --> 01:37:05.070
<v Speaker 5>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1723
01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:05.943
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a beards are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of like a new thing to come </v>

1724
01:37:08.271 --> 01:37:10.360
<v Speaker 5>back if I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I'm not mistaken,</v>

1725
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:11.203
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it definitely became like super hipster </v>

1726
01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:16.430
<v Speaker 5>guy with the long beard to buy like </v>
<v Speaker 5>beard oils.</v>

1727
01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.510
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As part of the experiment,</v>

1728
01:37:22.511 --> 01:37:26.770
<v Speaker 4>Male subjects were photographed clean </v>
<v Speaker 4>shaven five days after shaving 10 days,</v>

1729
01:37:26.771 --> 01:37:31.771
<v Speaker 4>and then after a whole four weeks </v>
<v Speaker 4>without shaving a 8,500</v>

1730
01:37:31.901 --> 01:37:35.140
<v Speaker 4>women were asked to rate them in on </v>
<v Speaker 4>attractiveness</v>

1731
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:37.343
<v Speaker 4>as a longterm romantic partner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Heavy stubble 10 days was found most </v>

1732
01:37:40.591 --> 01:37:41.424
<v Speaker 4>attractive while fold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beard's grown over four weeks came </v>

1733
01:37:44.671 --> 01:37:45.660
<v Speaker 4>second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

1734
01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:46.523
<v Speaker 4>They like the full even more than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>light stubble stubble was third while </v>

1735
01:37:50.791 --> 01:37:53.490
<v Speaker 4>clean shaven was ranked the least </v>
<v Speaker 4>attractive.</v>

1736
01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.130
<v Speaker 4>Margaret.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1737
01:37:55.410 --> 01:37:56.243
<v Speaker 4>Shaving is so annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate shaving to the skin on my face </v>

1738
01:37:59.431 --> 01:38:01.770
<v Speaker 4>and a lot because it irritates your </v>
<v Speaker 4>skin.</v>

1739
01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:04.860
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that's part of why I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>like it too,</v>

1740
01:38:04.861 --> 01:38:08.140
<v Speaker 4>because I know that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't look comfortable.</v>

1741
01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.170
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you shaved your legs.</v>

1742
01:38:10.171 --> 01:38:11.670
<v Speaker 4>Imagine doing on your face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1743
01:38:11.671 --> 01:38:16.410
<v Speaker 4>Geez Louise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like raising like some parts,</v>

1744
01:38:16.411 --> 01:38:19.470
<v Speaker 4>like my neck and the back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I use a razor for the back of my neck in</v>

1745
01:38:19.471 --> 01:38:20.850
<v Speaker 4>the shower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's changed my life.</v>

1746
01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:23.700
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is so.</v>

1747
01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:27.480
<v Speaker 4>The reason I grew a beard to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 4>is because it's so irritable.</v>

1748
01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:31.110
<v Speaker 4>I keep getting like pimples and cried </v>
<v Speaker 4>out and oily.</v>

1749
01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:32.690
<v Speaker 4>The whole God damn thing</v>

1750
01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:33.663
<v Speaker 5>river.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1751
01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:35.063
<v Speaker 5>I know this weird question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but have you ever had a professional </v>

1752
01:38:37.291 --> 01:38:40.350
<v Speaker 5>shave where they use like a straight </v>
<v Speaker 5>razor and somebody does it for you?</v>

1753
01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:43.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that I have Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's so strange that you would ask</v>

1754
01:38:43.291 --> 01:38:43.591
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1755
01:38:43.591 --> 01:38:44.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That wasn't that weird of a question.</v>

1756
01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:47.670
<v Speaker 5>It's honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>

1757
01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.050
<v Speaker 5>It was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was awesome.</v>

1758
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:50.803
<v Speaker 5>And it doesn't irritate you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the biggest thing is the </v>

1759
01:38:52.561 --> 01:38:57.300
<v Speaker 5>razor is so sharp that it doesn't make </v>
<v Speaker 5>you break out the way a normal radio.</v>

1760
01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:00.360
<v Speaker 5>I do have a fear during that procedure </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're going to slit your neck.</v>

1761
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:01.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sweeney todd style.</v>

1762
01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:05.730
<v Speaker 5>Just fucking down the rational fear that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll just be like,</v>

1763
01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:08.550
<v Speaker 5>whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got Him.</v>

1764
01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.860
<v Speaker 5>I was nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is freaky.</v>

1765
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:11.783
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got a guy with a razor sharp </v>

1766
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:15.790
<v Speaker 5>utensil to your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a.</v>

1767
01:39:15.791 --> 01:39:18.900
<v Speaker 5>it's a little uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but seems nice.</v>

1768
01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:25.140
<v Speaker 5>I would go for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This article is on Yahoo style blue.com.</v>

1769
01:39:29.150 --> 01:39:29.983
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1770
01:39:32.490 --> 01:39:35.760
<v Speaker 4>I love all these tech companies trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to like exist in the shadow of Google.</v>

1771
01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:37.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was style.</v>

1772
01:39:39.290 --> 01:39:40.123
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the research paper concludes that </v>

1773
01:39:43.261 --> 01:39:47.190
<v Speaker 4>beards consistently render men with an </v>
<v Speaker 4>older,</v>

1774
01:39:47.191 --> 01:39:51.480
<v Speaker 4>more masculine socially dominant and </v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive appearance.</v>

1775
01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:53.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Girls are fucking crazy.</v>

1776
01:39:54.090 --> 01:39:54.923
<v Speaker 4>I want a man that's aggressive and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominant beers maybe more attractive to </v>

1777
01:39:59.311 --> 01:40:01.770
<v Speaker 4>women when considering long term than </v>
<v Speaker 4>short term relationship.</v>

1778
01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:02.693
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking for a man that's socially </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominant and aggressive for a longterm </v>

1779
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:06.263
<v Speaker 4>relationship as they indicate a male's </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to sex successfully compete </v>

1780
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:15.060
<v Speaker 4>socially with other males for resources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're looking way too much into</v>

1781
01:40:15.061 --> 01:40:15.360
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1782
01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:15.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1783
01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.580

<v Speaker 5>I think it's a fad.</v>

1784
01:40:19.650 --> 01:40:21.750
<v Speaker 4>Of course not everyone can grow a full </v>
<v Speaker 4>beard.</v>

1785
01:40:21.751 --> 01:40:25.450
<v Speaker 4>It all depends if it suits you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:22.270
<v Speaker 4>Not that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>

1843
01:43:22.271 --> 01:43:24.790

<v Speaker 4>Well getting a haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not my style.</v>

01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:29.373
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>

1846
01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:33.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm not slamming the style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not my style.</v>

1847
01:43:33.970 --> 01:43:34.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all.</v>

1848
01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:36.310
<v Speaker 4>But I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1849
01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:37.173
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it felt so good to do it all the way </v>

1850
01:43:39.791 --> 01:43:40.660
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

1851
01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:43.120

<v Speaker 4>It grows so fast,</v>

1852
01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:45.880

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1854
01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:50.690
<v Speaker 4>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if there's a research about the</v>

1855
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.333
<v Speaker 4>hair stubble research found that men </v>
<v Speaker 4>were more attractive when they weren't </v>

1856
01:43:56.361 --> 01:43:57.950
<v Speaker 4>completely bald to the skin.</v>

1857
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:02.183
<v Speaker 4>Zach just pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually looked like the dude from </v>

<v Speaker 4>That was one of the insults.</v>

<v Speaker 4>we had a,</v>

1863
01:44:12.930 --> 01:44:15.750

<v Speaker 4>how do you look like a Jew and a Nazi at</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>end there.</v>

1871

<v Speaker 4>People are going to be demanding this </v>

<v Speaker 4>A little bit.</v>

1887
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:15.620
<v Speaker 4>Those were all meant for me to say to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you look like a dollar store.</v>

1888
01:45:15.630 --> 01:45:17.360
<v Speaker 4>Zurich from Fifth Element.</v>

1889
01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:27.020

<v Speaker 4>like a Jew and skin at the same time.</v>

1890
01:45:27.021 --> 01:45:28.570
<v Speaker 4>And Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cleans inbred cousins.</v>

1891
01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:30.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1892
01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:31.730
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got guys,</v>

1893
01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:36.200
<v Speaker 4>great video that I just gave you the </v>
<v Speaker 4>highlights.</v>

1894
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:40.600
<v Speaker 4>We can just clip this and putting this </v>
<v Speaker 4>on our main channel,</v>

1895
01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:46.220
<v Speaker 4>but hopefully we're going to start over </v>
<v Speaker 4>and why couldn't you have video,</v>

1896
01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:48.553
<v Speaker 4>new subject,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new everything and hopefully I can </v>

1897
01:45:51.321 --> 01:45:56.321
<v Speaker 4>leverage this haircut into a new joke </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't want to waste a broccoli</v>

1898
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:58.110
<v Speaker 4>assassin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cut for now.</v>

1899
01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:04.190
<v Speaker 4>I was calling this the carat cut because</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Broccoli was more about the crown.</v>

1900
01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:07.880
<v Speaker 4>Carrot is more about the stem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a carrot cut.</v>

1901
01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:12.740
<v Speaker 4>If I had spray Tan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be a real character,</v>

1902
01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:14.920
<v Speaker 4>but like a nice orange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

1903
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:18.520
<v Speaker 4>What could make that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1904
01:46:18.521 --> 01:46:20.770
<v Speaker 4>let's watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you too for your submission.</v>

1905

<v Speaker 5>county man found that out for himself </v>

1907
01:46:27.051 --> 01:46:29.910
<v Speaker 5>after having a gun pointed at him when </v>
<v Speaker 5>he did.</v>

1908
01:46:29.911 --> 01:46:33.140
<v Speaker 5>Just that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Empty Sean Allen talk with the victim.</v>

1909
01:46:33.141 --> 01:46:38.141
<v Speaker 5>In that case we'll say math is on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rise.</v>

1910
01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:39.273
<v Speaker 5>Math as a result.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it must've been a bad batch around </v>

1911
01:46:42.591 --> 01:46:43.424
<v Speaker 5>here called forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Counties went crazy in the last four </v>

1912
01:46:45.231 --> 01:46:46.064
<v Speaker 5>days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Neighbors notify Mason Tackett that his </v>

1913
01:46:48.471 --> 01:46:49.590
<v Speaker 5>cousin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Phillip,</v>

1914
01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:53.250
<v Speaker 5>Matthew Higgins was seen carrying items </v>
<v Speaker 5>from his house</v>

1915
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:55.780
<v Speaker 11>when I finally got down here and for the</v>
<v Speaker 11>house to look.</v>

1916
01:46:55.781 --> 01:46:58.470
<v Speaker 11>So you walk out the door was standing </v>
<v Speaker 11>wide open.</v>

1917
01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:00.830
<v Speaker 11>It looked like he was packing up for </v>
<v Speaker 11>yard sale.</v>

1918
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:04.420
<v Speaker 5>You got my fan by the way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is he like one inch tall?</v>

1920
01:47:09.010 --> 01:47:13.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like a chase through grant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like from his perspective,</v>

1921
01:47:19.610 --> 01:47:20.443
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not that everybody else wants </v>

1922
01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:31.490
<v Speaker 5>Tackett found items belonging to him.</v>

1923
01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:33.193
<v Speaker 11>Pull a gun on me when I got back around </v>
<v Speaker 11>the house because I guess he thought I </v>

1924
01:47:36.171 --> 01:47:37.370
<v Speaker 11>was upset with him.</v>

1925
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:38.343

<v Speaker 5>The target of the would be burglar who </v>

01:47:41.591 --> 01:47:45.990
<v Speaker 5>steals a cheese grater.</v>

<v Speaker 5>stone massage.</v>

1928
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.823

<v Speaker 5>receiving stolen property and being a </v>

1929
01:47:59.951 --> 01:48:03.010

<v Speaker 1>So I'll lead jimminy cricket.</v>

1945
01:48:56.430 --> 01:48:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Who steals a cheese grater?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stole my Nana's.</v>

1946
01:49:01.190 --> 01:49:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I gotta find something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1947
01:49:03.090 --> 01:49:08.090
<v Speaker 1>a boo just Bu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1948
01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:10.973
<v Speaker 1>this was an interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taylor swift apparently used to travel </v>

1949
01:49:15.871 --> 01:49:16.704
<v Speaker 1>in a suitcase to avoid hopper Razzi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Taylor swift is one of the most </v>

1950
01:49:22.261 --> 01:49:25.020
<v Speaker 1>famous people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I can understand that,</v>

1951
01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:25.973
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to avoid popper Razzi was </v>

1952
01:49:27.601 --> 01:49:28.434
<v Speaker 1>probably a source of great discomfort </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a and annoyance to her to say that </v>

1953
01:49:34.321 --> 01:49:36.270
<v Speaker 1>lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1954
01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:41.010
<v Speaker 1>the level that she went to to avoid them</v>
<v Speaker 1>was amazing.</v>

1955
01:49:41.370 --> 01:49:44.880
<v Speaker 1>And I want to say is a testament to how </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying these people are.</v>

1956
01:49:45.090 --> 01:49:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Rather than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should reflect poorly on her.</v>

1957
01:49:47.770 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 1>That being</v>

1958
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:49.270
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is incredible.</v>

1959
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:50.800
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zane,</v>

1960
01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:55.920
<v Speaker 4>this was the one direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Confirm.</v>

1961
01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.173
<v Speaker 4>Keep confronting winter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this guy from Zane says Taylor swift </v>

1962
01:50:00.281 --> 01:50:03.370
<v Speaker 4>was traveling around a suitcase during </v>
<v Speaker 4>the summer of 2007.</v>

1963
01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:07.390
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so he,</v>

1964
01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.250
<v Speaker 4>I love the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here it is.</v>

1965
01:50:09.251 --> 01:50:10.690
<v Speaker 4>Here's the alleged suitcase</v>

1966
01:50:12.670 --> 01:50:15.880
<v Speaker 5>the other day explained to me that this </v>
<v Speaker 5>was actually a rumor at the time and was</v>

1967
01:50:15.881 --> 01:50:17.620
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dismissed as just being kind of a meme,</v>

1968
01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.540
<v Speaker 5>but it's just way too over the top to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>

1969
01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:22.240
<v Speaker 5>But now evidently this guy saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1970
01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:24.700
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is all really happening.</v>

1971
01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:26.013
<v Speaker 5>Taylor swift.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when they were dating or they were </v>

1972
01:50:28.841 --> 01:50:29.674
<v Speaker 5>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you're super famous and now he's </v>

1973
01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:34.020
<v Speaker 5>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's an outing.</v>

1974
01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:34.900
<v Speaker 5>Elaborated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1975
01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:40.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine that she's in that sick also.</v>

1976
01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:43.530
<v Speaker 5>It's such like an undignified thing for </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone like Taylor swift.</v>

1977
01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:46.410
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now curl up and getting the suitcase.</v>

1978
01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.490
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1979
01:50:47.491 --> 01:50:48.620
<v Speaker 5>pad it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's nice and cool.</v>

1980
01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:50.510
<v Speaker 5>I was wondering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I like or know of it.</v>

1981
01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:54.000
<v Speaker 5>Or is it even like form cut to her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1982
01:50:54.001 --> 01:50:54.834
<v Speaker 5>Like it's a little like fetal position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Taylor swift slot that she just doesn't </v>

1983
01:50:58.351 --> 01:51:02.070
<v Speaker 5>have that much space in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Taylor swift being transported in a huge</v>

1984
01:51:02.071 --> 01:51:06.060
<v Speaker 5>suitcase from our tribeca apartment in </v>
<v Speaker 5>to her truck fleet of cars,</v>

1985
01:51:06.061 --> 01:51:09.300
<v Speaker 5>including two large cadillacs and three </v>
<v Speaker 5>suv is arrived at Taylor's apartment,</v>

1986
01:51:09.301 --> 01:51:12.360
<v Speaker 5>Tribeca to move a large suitcase from </v>
<v Speaker 5>her apartment.</v>

1987
01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:14.793
<v Speaker 4>Also dozens of Taylor swift security </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys were present to move this package </v>

1988
01:51:17.301 --> 01:51:20.450
<v Speaker 4>carefully as Taylor swift remains to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>unseen for a long time.</v>

1989
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:25.610
<v Speaker 4>Now I went and there's a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 4>photos of this suitcase</v>

1990
01:51:26.610 --> 01:51:27.443
<v Speaker 5>and for the audio listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stay understand this suitcase is not </v>

1991
01:51:29.761 --> 01:51:31.470
<v Speaker 5>that bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1992
01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:34.260
<v Speaker 5>you would have to be smaller than a </v>
<v Speaker 5>person for sure.</v>

1993
01:51:34.261 --> 01:51:35.530
<v Speaker 5>She definitely laid</v>

1994
01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:40.820
<v Speaker 4>barone all crunched up in a ball cannon </v>
<v Speaker 4>ball into a swimming pool.</v>

1995
01:51:41.630 --> 01:51:42.370
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1996
01:51:42.370 --> 01:51:46.310
<v Speaker 5>here some detectives have a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger than a regular suitcase.</v>

1997
01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:46.870
<v Speaker 5>I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1998
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:48.910
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a mute for use for </v>
<v Speaker 5>musical.</v>

1999
01:51:49.250 --> 01:51:51.040
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can see here.</v>

2000
01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:54.793
<v Speaker 4>I mean if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of a testament to help </v>

2001
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:57.103
<v Speaker 4>FDIC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This Papa Razzi imagine you're willing </v>

2002
01:51:59.451 --> 01:52:02.900
<v Speaker 4>to do crawl into a fricken suitcase to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

2003
01:52:03.110 --> 01:52:04.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know what she's doing?</v>

2004
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.920
<v Speaker 4>She probably wants to go do something </v>
<v Speaker 4>private.</v>

2005
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:07.783
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she wants to fly somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to a beach without everyone knowing </v>

2006
01:52:09.981 --> 01:52:14.480
<v Speaker 4>what she's doing all the time every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if like I get it.</v>

2007
01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:15.403
<v Speaker 4>If you're trying to go hang out with all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these filters like filming you and </v>

2008
01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:20.000

<v Speaker 4>you got to do what you can.</v>

2010
01:52:24.730 --> 01:52:29.730
<v Speaker 5>I always see videos of Justin Bieber and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the proprietor people driving him crazy.</v>

2011
01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:31.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're pretty aggressive with Justin.</v>

2012
01:52:31.871 --> 01:52:35.500
<v Speaker 5>I've seen that shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gives them shipped back though.</v>

2013
01:52:35.501 --> 01:52:36.334
<v Speaker 5>I like watching those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of videos where he's </v>

2014
01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:39.813
<v Speaker 5>nice at first and they really push it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they start asking him really </v>

2015
01:52:43.361 --> 01:52:47.150
<v Speaker 5>inappropriate getting in his way so he </v>
<v Speaker 5>can drive away.</v>

2016
01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:48.633
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2017

<v Speaker 4>It's so.</v>

2019
01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:55.633
<v Speaker 4>It's so cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People need to appreciate how </v>

2020
01:52:57.081 --> 01:52:58.160
<v Speaker 4>challenging and</v>

2021
01:52:59.270 --> 01:53:00.103

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2025

<v Speaker 4>public,</v>

2026
01:53:10.571 --> 01:53:13.540

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2028
01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:16.083
<v Speaker 4>so I hope that people have a more of </v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciation for what ultra famous </v>

2029
01:53:20.291 --> 01:53:21.124
<v Speaker 4>people go through on a day to day basis </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that it's not all just because </v>

2030
01:53:23.681 --> 01:53:24.514
<v Speaker 4>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always hear this kind of sentiment of </v>

2031
01:53:25.151 --> 01:53:25.511
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

01:53:25.511 --> 01:53:26.344
<v Speaker 4>you have no right to complain once I </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell that to somebody that crawls into </v>

2033
01:53:28.781 --> 01:53:30.370
<v Speaker 4>side a suitcase.</v>

2034
01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:35.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously the riches and the fame</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2035
01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:37.640
<v Speaker 5>that's nice and I'm sure they enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2036
01:53:37.641 --> 01:53:40.550
<v Speaker 5>but you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it comes with baggage.</v>

2037
01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:41.650
<v Speaker 5>Comes with some serious bag,</v>

2129
01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:54.273
<v Speaker 1>Thinking of setting up a panel here with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian and Dan to join us and to go over </v>

<v Speaker 1>episode on Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me know what you guys think about </v>

2132
01:59:08.561 --> 01:59:09.790
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>

<v Speaker 1>for the frog loves a Ms.</v>

2138
01:59:25.781 --> 01:59:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Dot piggy is big titties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2139
01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the classic.</v>

2140
01:59:28.130 --> 01:59:29.810
<v Speaker 1>That was the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I want to know.</v>

2141
01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:32.153
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2142
01:59:34.750 --> 01:59:35.583
<v Speaker 1>did you know that I read this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That farts used to be to actually a </v>

2143
01:59:41.831 --> 01:59:42.664
<v Speaker 1>danger to public safety before people </v>
<v Speaker 1>started wearing underwear because you </v>

2144
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:47.343
<v Speaker 1>actually fart out aerosol shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particles and people could breed them </v>

2145
01:59:51.161 --> 01:59:53.310
<v Speaker 1>and get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear it.</v>

2146
01:59:53.311 --> 01:59:55.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what I read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people wear underwear.</v>

2147
01:59:55.571 --> 01:59:59.190
<v Speaker 1>They invented it back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much just underwear do,</v>

2148
01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:00.910
<v Speaker 1>did you read this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read it.</v>

2149
02:00:00.911 --> 02:00:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seemed credible.</v>

2150
02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>But that your farts obviously our permit</v>
<v Speaker 1>or passed through the fabric.</v>

2151
02:00:08.351 --> 02:00:13.351
<v Speaker 1>So the ship particles are not allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>freely enter your,</v>

2152
02:00:13.630 --> 02:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>your neighbor's face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

2153
02:00:15.890 --> 02:00:16.723
<v Speaker 1>But look that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear a faculty commando is like a </v>

2154
02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:20.590
<v Speaker 1>public health nuisance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2155
02:00:20.591 --> 02:00:21.424
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think through the pants you're </v>

2156
02:00:22.181 --> 02:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>probably fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're like bare ass farting,</v>

2157
02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:26.861
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look it up.</v>

2158
02:00:26.861 --> 02:00:28.130
<v Speaker 1>I swore a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check me right now.</v>

2159
02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was all fucking day.</v>

2160
02:00:31.530 --> 02:00:32.363
<v Speaker 1>I think that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole statement about being </v>

2161
02:00:34.750 --> 02:00:35.583
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people should type if </v>

2162
02:00:36.491 --> 02:00:39.850
<v Speaker 1>they've stuck around this data type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This did,</v>

2163
02:00:39.851 --> 02:00:40.684
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>farts are dangerous if you're not </v>

2164
02:00:41.861 --> 02:00:42.694
<v Speaker 1>wearing underwear</v>

2165
02:00:45.810 --> 02:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>done deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if I see that,</v>

2166
02:00:47.850 --> 02:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll know that you want an episode on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday.</v>
