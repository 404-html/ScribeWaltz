00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Thinking for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's guest is Tim Heidecker,</v>

4
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>the triple threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would even say musician,</v>

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.790
<v Speaker 1>actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>

6
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>and my humble opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most influential comedians of</v>

7
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>our generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I say that?</v>

8
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most.</v>

9
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.780
<v Speaker 1>I would say one of the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of a more influential one </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the top of my head in my life,</v>

11
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>but I can definitely tell you on my part</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wouldn't be in comedy today,</v>

12
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>I think if it wasn't for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

13
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to get some fears.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know it's always tough.</v>

21
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to get through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think about that intro?</v>

22
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Was it too much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very a sarcastic,</v>

23
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I assume not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And start counting to get off.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't want this to be uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want this to be a positive experience </v>

29
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:21.070

<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

32
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to hear that because I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit that I was nervous.</v>

33
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shoot,</v>

34
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was nervous,</v>

35
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you why because I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure which Tim I was going to get.</v>

36
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

37
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>They're real tim or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.063
<v Speaker 1>interview Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interview Tim that kind of makes </v>

39
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:43.661
<v Speaker 1>like a parody of we'll see how it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like</v>

40
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a different place right now,</v>

41
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.850
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

42
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

43
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have some mutual friends and,</v>

44
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've,</v>

45
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

46
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested to talk to you in a,</v>

47
00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open and frank manner without any kind </v>

48
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 2>of aggression.</v>

49
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily confusion,</v>

50
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.930
<v Speaker 1>but you said you're in a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

51
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.781
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

52
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:09.614
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I've done a fair amount of the </v>

53
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 2>kind of Kauffman s uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

54
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are fun sometimes and funny,</v>

55
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.940
<v Speaker 2>sometimes results in funny content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely content.</v>

56
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.810
<v Speaker 2>I've enjoyed Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like I've done that.</v>

57
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I've done enough of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where to keep doing it sometimes becomes</v>

58
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 2>redundant and not as much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

59
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.600
<v Speaker 2>and now that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

60
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.483
<v Speaker 2>that maybe I've made enough stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is interesting things to talk </v>

61
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:39.194
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's an interesting experience to </v>

62
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:44.270
<v Speaker 2>watch me talk about things in more of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sincere fashion.</v>

63
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it harder for you to be,</v>

64
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.120
<v Speaker 2>is it easier in a way to do interviews </v>
<v Speaker 2>under that Kauffman ass kind of?</v>

65
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>

66
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.813
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a little easier to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>this way because I'm not worried about </v>

67
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 2>being in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a bit the whole time.</v>

68
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>But we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

69
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 3>we'll talk it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see how this goes.</v>

70
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.500
<v Speaker 3>I think I have a propensity to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>amusing without being confrontational.</v>

71
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

73
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.253
<v Speaker 3>but now we're like very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny that we're analyzing the </v>

74
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 3>style of interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't really talked at all.</v>

75
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.913
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

76
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.833
<v Speaker 3>just a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess we should start before play all </v>

77
00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that we got that out of the way.</v>

78
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

79
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you,</v>

80
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 3>thanks for the coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

81
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 3>God bless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is it?</v>

82
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 3>And it's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

83
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Good balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they,</v>

84
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.751
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's black.</v>

85
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.584
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of hard to mess up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did you start drinking black </v>

86
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 3>coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that right away or did you,</v>

87
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 3>were you cream first grade?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

88
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were sipping coffee at first?</v>

89
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would try it.</v>

90
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a very boring question to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start off.</v>

91
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were getting our feet in the,</v>

92
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're tipping our code hair.</v>

93
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are good.</v>

94
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who has the braveness?</v>

95
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 3>The ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I did.</v>

96
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 3>It was boring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did drink coffee in high school.</v>

97
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a diner level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

98
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:05.490
<v Speaker 3>going and cream and the sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

99
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

100
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 3>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

101
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped for a long time after a very,</v>

102
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like anxiety.</v>

103
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 3>Like I drank a lot of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

104
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 3>I just remember drinking a lot of iced </v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee.</v>

105
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.580
<v Speaker 3>One at a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

106
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 3>A friend of mine and got the full panic </v>
<v Speaker 3>caffeine,</v>

107
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 3>the panic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like over caffeinated panic,</v>

108
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.553
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine feeling and then stopped for a </v>

109
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:30.710
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then like,</v>

110
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.823
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the past,</v>

111
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 3>I would say 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drink coffee in the morning,</v>

112
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 3>but to get even to get even more in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeds and boring,</v>

113
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all this an event tonight.</v>

114
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.570
<v Speaker 3>So I usually can't drink coffee after </v>
<v Speaker 3>the afternoon,</v>

115
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after lunch.</v>

116
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now the judge tonight,</v>

117
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 3>so I'm just going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to let myself have some coffee</v>

118
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 3>so I could talk very fast during this </v>
<v Speaker 3>interview and we can get through it,</v>

119
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>the colors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sketches,</v>

162
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>the surrealism.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like,</v>

165
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what would you have been?</v>

166
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

167
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.041
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

168
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 1>and I love Seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be frank.</v>

169
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I love Seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always been my favorite.</v>

170
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I love comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't so much,</v>

171
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and deep right.</v>

172
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.903
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you when I saw that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like mind blown because I didn't </v>

173
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>know that you could kind of be funny in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way and it was done in a way that I</v>

174
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 1>was like accessible to me in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you could maybe do it.</v>

175
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was Seinfeld didn't feel I can </v>

176
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:17.294
<v Speaker 1>never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can never ever do that feels so far </v>

177
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:20.294
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although do you notice now if you watch </v>

178
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:23.610
<v Speaker 1>it on Hulu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

179
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 1>it feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like a set now.</v>

180
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 1>It feels like you're way they stretched </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or the way they've made.</v>

181
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:34.391
<v Speaker 1>Like I think the problem is that all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our tvs are so good that you can see the</v>

182
00:07:36.361 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking down that street.</v>

183
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

184
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.610
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like Seinfeld,</v>

185
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.341
<v Speaker 1>you fan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

187
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I could watch that every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

188
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 1>it's probably crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

189
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically when I saw that I knew in a</v>

190
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 1>way that I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't need to know those staff.</v>

208
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get my,</v>

<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

212
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.290
<v Speaker 1>That was the time when we met and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Israel.</v>

213
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.563
<v Speaker 1>Anything was here and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking over skype like every </v>

214
00:08:51.811 --> 00:08:55.120
<v Speaker 1>day and he would always try to send me </v>
<v Speaker 1>your guys's sketches.</v>

215
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't work in Israel and we will </v>
<v Speaker 1>always like,</v>

216
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what you're talking about.</v>

217
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:02.230
<v Speaker 1>It like he couldn't stop talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

218
00:09:02.231 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 1>It was forbidden fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was forbidden fruit.</v>

219
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And I think we downloaded a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

220
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I apologize for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe they were pirated,</v>

221
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 1>but I was spreading the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't care a bit.</v>

222
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Torrenting everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

223
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 1>at that time that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

224
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.583
<v Speaker 1>that was the pirate rotted Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember sitting down in your </v>

225
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:21.054
<v Speaker 1>sister and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to wash this Brownie mountain </v>

226
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she,</v>

227
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>she liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was loving it.</v>

228
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.060
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not one of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had to wait till the question is,</v>

229
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 1>is that that first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably hear that a lot from people</v>

230
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:38.580
<v Speaker 1>that you have influenced their comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

231
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 1>how do you accept that level of praise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

232
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 1>do you accept that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

233
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what I mean?</v>

234
00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:43.981
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

235
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 2>not first of all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when,</v>

236
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about our work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

237
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:49.733
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

238
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is not just me,</v>

239
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:52.800
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Eric,</v>

240
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Speaker 2>it's John's Krystal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Doug Loosen,</v>

241
00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:55.531
<v Speaker 2>hop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the whole,</v>

242
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:59.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a collective of people that made </v>
<v Speaker 2>that what it was.</v>

243
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

244
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

245
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not too,</v>

246
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

247
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 2>narcissistic about it that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is all me.</v>

248
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:10.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

249
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we admit we,</v>

250
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much of that period was making stuff.</v>

251
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.980
<v Speaker 2>It's in such an insular way in such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

252
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.863
<v Speaker 2>for ourselves that whether people dug it</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not was kind of not as important to </v>

253
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:27.414
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

254
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.583
<v Speaker 2>And we prided ourself on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we were not doing anything for </v>

255
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 2>fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were not fan friendly.</v>

256
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that we,</v>

257
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

258
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.100
<v Speaker 2>we were very nice to our fans I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

259
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 2>but we weren't trying to please anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>but ourselves.</v>

260
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.560
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

261
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.513
<v Speaker 2>I ended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool to have because I had that I </v>

262
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:50.030
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

263
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.023
<v Speaker 2>the kids in the hall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking before the show that I </v>

264
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 2>like something like the kids in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hall,</v>

265
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:54.683
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're totally a influential to me and </v>

266
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

267
00:10:57.961 --> 00:10:58.794
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night live and all those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you get to meet those people </v>

268
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 2>sometimes in life and you get to share </v>
<v Speaker 2>that with them.</v>

269
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.980
<v Speaker 2>And it's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely nice.</v>

270
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:05.814
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that those people are out </v>

271
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:09.360
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you're,</v>

272
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it usually results in kind of decent </v>

273
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:14.100
<v Speaker 2>people too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

274
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

275
00:11:15.981 --> 00:11:16.814
<v Speaker 1>I think it's interesting what you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that you guys were making it for </v>

276
00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:22.240
<v Speaker 1>yourself cause I definitely think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows the,</v>

277
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.950
<v Speaker 1>almost didn't care about how accessible </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

278
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.010
<v Speaker 1>The anyone that wasn't like initiated or</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say,</v>

279
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely part of what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>special about it to what they can.</v>

280
00:11:30.921 --> 00:11:35.160
<v Speaker 1>A sense that it was very much your own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just really your guys,</v>

281
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:35.994
<v Speaker 1>his own thing.</v>

282
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had our,</v>

283
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.730
<v Speaker 2>a strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense of what we thought was funny and</v>

284
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 2>we felt like we were delivering to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other that,</v>

285
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were making ourselves laugh and,</v>

286
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.520
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stakes were so low.</v>

287
00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:51.354
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were on in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and we were given very little </v>

288
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 2>money relatively to make something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

289
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.623
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it just seemed like we were most of </v>

290
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 2>the time learning on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the job and making stuff.</v>

291
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:04.624
<v Speaker 2>And if you use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the first season you see </v>

292
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:10.060
<v Speaker 2>stuff that was shot like in the hallways</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like out in front of the office.</v>

293
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:10.894
<v Speaker 2>That was all like probably a lot of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like making a first pass at </v>

294
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 2>something and it not working and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>going like,</v>

295
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:17.584
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just go outside and shoot </v>

296
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

297
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.943
<v Speaker 2>So we were given just tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of freedom to experiment and </v>

298
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:25.670
<v Speaker 2>figure it out.</v>

299
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.190
<v Speaker 3>What time did originally air on adult </v>
<v Speaker 3>swim?</v>

300
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like 1230 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>1215 maybe.</v>

301
00:12:31.761 --> 00:12:34.490
<v Speaker 3>It was like really fun to tell your </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents that you have a,</v>

302
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm on TV at 1215 on something called </v>
<v Speaker 3>adult swim,</v>

303
00:12:39.381 --> 00:12:41.420
<v Speaker 3>which is what we feel all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't,</v>

304
00:12:41.421 --> 00:12:42.750
<v Speaker 3>it really was a couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

305
00:12:42.751 --> 00:12:44.450
<v Speaker 3>I had been around for a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

306
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.570
<v Speaker 3>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody still knows what I mean.</v>

307
00:12:47.571 --> 00:12:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

308
00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.870
<v Speaker 3>well rick and I saw your show on comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>central.</v>

309
00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:51.770
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

310
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.360
<v Speaker 3>they don't even do it on their network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They saw it.</v>

311
00:12:53.361 --> 00:12:54.194
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

312
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's still like people,</v>

313
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.050
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing this year has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

314
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.710
<v Speaker 2>this free real estate</v>

315
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.480
<v Speaker 3>meme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

316
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.200
<v Speaker 3>we wanted to ask you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happened.</v>

317
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

318
00:13:05.211 --> 00:13:06.830
<v Speaker 3>it comes out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

319
00:13:06.831 --> 00:13:09.860
<v Speaker 3>It comes out of the reddit Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

320
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have any</v>

321
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:13.993
<v Speaker 2>connection to the work really to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original piece or to who I am or </v>

322
00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:18.194
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I had this little part and the </v>

323
00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:24.500
<v Speaker 2>ant man movie and people on the internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like,</v>

324
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.633
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you know the guy from the free real </v>

325
00:13:26.451 --> 00:13:26.650
<v Speaker 2>estate,</v>

326
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.110
<v Speaker 3>these names?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And No,</v>

327
00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:28.740
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know.</v>

328
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so fun.</v>

329
00:13:30.021 --> 00:13:32.990
<v Speaker 3>And people get mad about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a weird thing.</v>

330
00:13:32.991 --> 00:13:36.020
<v Speaker 3>And this happened to Eric with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe thing and you know,</v>

331
00:13:36.021 --> 00:13:37.070
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's chill.</v>

332
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does that mean?</v>

333
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:39.973
<v Speaker 3>How does that feel almost to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like appreciating a piece without </v>

334
00:13:44.271 --> 00:13:46.130
<v Speaker 3>knowing the origin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that bother you at all?</v>

335
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does a little bit.</v>

336
00:13:47.841 --> 00:13:48.674
<v Speaker 3>I think it certainly does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the also there's a resignation to </v>

337
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:57.020
<v Speaker 3>not having any control over that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's become yours,</v>

338
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.883
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's whatever kind of cool too on the </v>

339
00:13:59.271 --> 00:13:59.940
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

340
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.741
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

341
00:14:00.741 --> 00:14:04.850
<v Speaker 3>I saw a fucking free real estate mural </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

342
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.450
<v Speaker 3>I loved that sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

343
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.300
<v Speaker 3>and like I remember writing it</v>

344
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.183
<v Speaker 2>and like it being such a simple stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea knowing that you didn't have to do </v>

345
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:18.700
<v Speaker 2>very much to make it work.</v>

346
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.510
<v Speaker 3>I want to ask you about that specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>sketch because I'm,</v>

347
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.373
<v Speaker 3>I always wonder like where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's your guys' minds when you over </v>

348
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.180
<v Speaker 3>high?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we just get super,</v>

349
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.230
<v Speaker 3>are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

350
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.490
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's always the </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumption.</v>

351
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.343
<v Speaker 3>I didn't assume that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think you can't be that </v>

352
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.430
<v Speaker 3>creative when you're no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like that.</v>

353
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.383
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember specifically that idea </v>

354
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:42.784
<v Speaker 3>of where you're headed with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really probably comes down to it's </v>

355
00:14:46.111 --> 00:14:49.090
<v Speaker 3>free real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do a commercial where were real,</v>

356
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably seeing a uh,</v>

357
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.840
<v Speaker 3>late,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm carney,</v>

358
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:57.430
<v Speaker 3>some real estate commercial and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making that little turn and then knowing</v>

359
00:14:57.741 --> 00:15:01.190
<v Speaker 3>that we could just go in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>green screen for a half hour.</v>

360
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:02.783
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we would give it to our boys and </v>

361
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.560
<v Speaker 3>they would turn it into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Doug would say,</v>

362
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:07.790
<v Speaker 3>we give them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

363
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:09.080
<v Speaker 3>give him some shit to shine.</v>

364
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.263
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it feels like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes because I feel like our style </v>

365
00:15:13.411 --> 00:15:15.650
<v Speaker 3>is similar years off saving it's Meyer </v>
<v Speaker 3>from you.</v>

366
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:16.603
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of times we'll go just fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>around in front of a camera and then </v>

367
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:23.630
<v Speaker 3>it's like I have no idea if that was any</v>
<v Speaker 3>good or not,</v>

368
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to sit and edit it for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand years.</v>

369
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.910
<v Speaker 3>That'll work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully.</v>

370
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.923
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there we've gotten more </v>

371
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:36.641
<v Speaker 3>efficient without I think and are also </v>
<v Speaker 3>our style or interest in what we want to</v>

372
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:38.324
<v Speaker 3>make has changed a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's some stuff we've done that's </v>

373
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:41.834
<v Speaker 3>more conceived and thought out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>planned and then that becomes pretty </v>

374
00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 3>much what you intended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bedtime stories.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do you guys oh well,</v>

422
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Vic Berger is a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

423
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.870
<v Speaker 2>And Love Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

424
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 2>I was telling you earlier the story with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him where he was,</v>

425
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:01.164
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making fan videos for on cinema and </v>

426
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.373
<v Speaker 2>sending them in and they're like these </v>
<v Speaker 2>music videos he's made that are really </v>

427
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.340
<v Speaker 2>good songs and funny videos just using </v>
<v Speaker 2>our footage from the show.</v>

428
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

429
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.613
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were just amused by that and we </v>

430
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.830
<v Speaker 2>contacted him and had him make some </v>
<v Speaker 2>other stuff.</v>

431
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:26.910
<v Speaker 2>And that set amount of course I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave them a little confidence.</v>

432
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:30.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like all you need is that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>little like one little boost.</v>

433
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.381
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so true.</v>

434
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:32.620
<v Speaker 2>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

435
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.503
<v Speaker 2>today's today as you were touching on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like so easy to kind of get ahold </v>

436
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.880
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

437
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.833
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting that if you ever like </v>
<v Speaker 2>determined and you're make something </v>

438
00:18:43.201 --> 00:18:43.740
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

439
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get,</v>

440
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.480
<v Speaker 2>you can get I to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

441
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.600
<v Speaker 2>but they're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making something good is,</v>

442
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:50.170
<v Speaker 2>I think the hard part's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

443
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.173
<v Speaker 2>the barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are a reductive of other </v>

444
00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 2>people's work or they're not ready yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>or they don't have the resources.</v>

445
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.180
<v Speaker 2>They're not good enough for us or they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

446
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.570
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

447
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.880
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's still a small,</v>

448
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:10.141
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

449
00:19:10.141 --> 00:19:10.974
<v Speaker 2>it's not a ton of overly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly talented new voices still </v>

450
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:16.374
<v Speaker 2>like going to be a small one kid out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred that's got like this new look </v>

451
00:19:20.131 --> 00:19:20.964
<v Speaker 2>at something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

452
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.400
<v Speaker 2>but there's plenty of funny people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of,</v>

453
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.293
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

454
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.940
<v Speaker 2>definitely good filmmakers and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

455
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 2>speaking of Bob and he's gone on to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this incredible success.</v>

456
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Has it been crazy to watch because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

457
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.660
<v Speaker 2>because that's formation from a comedian</v>
<v Speaker 2>to dramatic actors,</v>

458
00:19:36.661 --> 00:19:37.650
<v Speaker 2>but really something.</v>

459
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when we were,</v>

460
00:19:40.421 --> 00:19:41.254
<v Speaker 2>he was in a transition period I think in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his life when we met him because he had </v>

461
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:48.750
<v Speaker 2>come out of doing a couple of pilots </v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't go,</v>

462
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:49.584
<v Speaker 2>he was directing a couple of movies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was not really sure what he </v>

463
00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:55.800
<v Speaker 2>was going to be doing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was helping us and he was helping</v>

464
00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:59.910
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of other people get started in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the business and,</v>

465
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.080
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah.</v>

466
00:20:01.081 --> 00:20:05.580
<v Speaker 2>So I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a,</v>

467
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>

468
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.990
<v Speaker 2>he's got a good attitude about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>

469
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:10.690
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>how the fuck are you doing?</v>

534
00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.960

<v Speaker 3>I just got asked to do it because Jordan</v>

539
00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:25.230
<v Speaker 3>was interested in you playing this role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

540
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.283
<v Speaker 3>me and mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just writing and that's got to feel </v>

<v Speaker 3>Pretty amazing.</v>

543
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:31.743
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know him a little bit from the world </v>

544
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.390
<v Speaker 3>of comedy and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not,</v>

545
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:40.510
<v Speaker 3>and he was such a big fan of the comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the movie,</v>

546
00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:41.344
<v Speaker 3>the comedy that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of those movies that when it </v>

547
00:23:44.831 --> 00:23:45.800
<v Speaker 3>came out again</v>

548
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.020
<v Speaker 2>was a thing that half the people hated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

549
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:52.850
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the reviews of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

550
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:56.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like an they're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reviewed and um,</v>

551
00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:01.990
<v Speaker 2>we felt rick and I felt just like beaten</v>
<v Speaker 2>up by the whole thing and uh,</v>

552
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 2>like very proud of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

553
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.140
<v Speaker 2>but also like furious that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

554
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.423
<v Speaker 2>that these people weren't getting what </v>
<v Speaker 2>rick was trying to do and all this </v>

555
00:24:09.891 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what happens is like that movie,</v>

556
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:17.630
<v Speaker 2>people like your age and younger fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking like love that movie.</v>

557
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.880
<v Speaker 2>And it meant a lot to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somebody like Jordan is like,</v>

558
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 2>that's one of my favorite movies of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>or of a,</v>

559
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:26.700
<v Speaker 2>maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's his favorite movie,</v>

560
00:24:26.701 --> 00:24:31.701
<v Speaker 2>but he thinks of me through that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm very grateful for that.</v>

561
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:34.443
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you tired of being like loved and </v>

562
00:24:35.981 --> 00:24:36.814

<v Speaker 3>That's kind of been like the defining </v>

563
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.360
<v Speaker 3>characteristic of like your career.</v>

<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

567
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.240

<v Speaker 3>Where like the message,</v>

586
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.850
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know there was such a tough </v>
<v Speaker 3>crowd.</v>

587
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

588
00:25:45.681 --> 00:25:48.050
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was just like a flood.</v>

589
00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.363
<v Speaker 3>There was like one after the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was when we learned that this </v>

590
00:25:52.761 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 3>is a cruel business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

591
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.503
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

592
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.000
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but are macho side was like,</v>

593
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck them.</v>

594
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.761
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

595
00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:02.960
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're pissing you off.</v>

596
00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:05.510
<v Speaker 3>And then we kind of embrace that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

597
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.373
<v Speaker 3>but it still hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does hurt cause you just want to be </v>

598
00:26:10.581 --> 00:26:11.414
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we made this and make you laugh and to </v>

599
00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:15.110
<v Speaker 3>make us laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say if you don't like it,</v>

600
00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:15.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

601
00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:19.430
<v Speaker 3>here's why you care about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

602
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.280
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of things I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

603
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.490
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't make me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never like rage.</v>

604
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.680
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make me go on the message </v>
<v Speaker 3>board and say like,</v>

605
00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.680
<v Speaker 3>I hate the king of Queens or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

606
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:36.230
<v Speaker 3>are you at the point or do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

607
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:37.873
<v Speaker 3>I'm just wondering like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you feel like those kind of comments </v>

608
00:26:40.821 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 3>don't get to anymore when you get into </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff with people</v>

609
00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.920
<v Speaker 2>now become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I've kind of,</v>

610
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:48.803
<v Speaker 2>I try to get off the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social media was telling you I'm </v>

611
00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.910
<v Speaker 2>taking twitter breaks and personal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

612
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do take it personally.</v>

613
00:26:57.251 --> 00:26:58.084
<v Speaker 2>I've been honest about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do take it personally and then I'm </v>

614
00:27:01.371 --> 00:27:02.204
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a cycle now of people who are </v>

615
00:27:03.581 --> 00:27:04.414
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be your biggest fan and now </v>

616
00:27:06.821 --> 00:27:08.380
<v Speaker 2>you suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's like,</v>

617
00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.380
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's worse or</v>

618
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:12.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that feel?</v>

619
00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:13.404
<v Speaker 1>I mean like genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel when people tell you </v>

620
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:15.504
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

621
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>

622
00:27:18.571 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's something that's,</v>

623
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.820
<v Speaker 2>that I know is a little risky that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that's a little s self,</v>

624
00:27:25.921 --> 00:27:29.730
<v Speaker 2>a little personal or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially my music,</v>

625
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:32.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put out my music analytical.</v>

626
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:33.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the and which obviously has a </v>

627
00:27:34.921 --> 00:27:38.310
<v Speaker 2>tendency to people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that get upset about it.</v>

628
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

629
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.680
<v Speaker 2>it's all personal taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know the music I make is not the,</v>

630
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.860
<v Speaker 2>it's not popular music anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

631
00:27:46.861 --> 00:27:49.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like a kind of music I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

632
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.720
<v Speaker 2>so people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sucks,</v>

633
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.770
<v Speaker 2>then I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also doesn't,</v>

634
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.250
<v Speaker 2>you never want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to hear that.</v>

635
00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.223
<v Speaker 2>Rather not hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the easiest thing to do is just to </v>

636
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.260
<v Speaker 2>not repeat it.</v>

637
00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've done.</v>

638
00:28:03.101 --> 00:28:08.101
<v Speaker 1>I've been very public about how I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even like that I wanted to,</v>

639
00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:11.680
<v Speaker 1>I needed to stop engaging in reading and</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments.</v>

640
00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.440
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's funny to say,</v>

641
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.293
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a process for me to unstick </v>

642
00:28:16.421 --> 00:28:19.780
<v Speaker 1>myself because I've been trying to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it for like a year.</v>

643
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.033
<v Speaker 1>I'd say in the past couple months I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been successfully really boris like </v>

644
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.250
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like in between that process I would</v>

645
00:28:27.251 --> 00:28:30.280
<v Speaker 1>read comments of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this should just really upset me.</v>

646
00:28:30.281 --> 00:28:31.114
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

647
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.180
<v Speaker 1>what do you guys think about h three?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Reading comments anymore.</v>

648
00:28:34.181 --> 00:28:35.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's not doing him any good.</v>

649
00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.760
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

650
00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:39.913
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] man can read probably 20 </v>

651
00:28:42.251 --> 00:28:44.530
<v Speaker 1>positive things.</v>

652
00:28:44.531 --> 00:28:46.270

<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

653

<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that too.</v>

654
00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:49.890
<v Speaker 1>And it really disturbs me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know 20 people or like changed </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

00:29:11.111 --> 00:29:11.944
<v Speaker 2>contribute to sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the jokes and the story in a way that's </v>

663
00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:16.953
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would want to hang out with a lot of </v>

<v Speaker 1>read anything and I started to feel </v>

670
00:29:35.851 --> 00:29:38.280
<v Speaker 1>really like disconnected from </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

671
00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:42.520
<v Speaker 1>which also doesn't feel right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The large human being is you can meet or</v>

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:29.680
<v Speaker 1>started as a movie review,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still is essentially broke,</v>

816
00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Speaker 1>but it was this two couple of guys doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>films,</v>

817
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.010
<v Speaker 1>but he's been a lot of twists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of turns.</v>

818
00:36:35.011 --> 00:36:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of tribulations.</v>

819
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:38.723
<v Speaker 1>Was it always your intention from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning that it would have this kind </v>

820
00:36:41.611 --> 00:36:44.120
<v Speaker 1>of story arc to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda just as it went?</v>

821
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:45.720
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story there is,</v>

822
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greg and I were both on the comedy,</v>

823
00:36:49.871 --> 00:36:50.704
<v Speaker 2>the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedy that we talked about earlier </v>

824
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 2>and as you do with movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

825
00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.380
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of downtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

826
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:58.263
<v Speaker 2>there was this feeling that summer of </v>
<v Speaker 2>there being kind of a overabundance of </v>

827
00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.550
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medians,</v>

828
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:05.403
<v Speaker 2>just the mark Marin thing had been kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of blowing up and there was just this </v>

829
00:37:08.981 --> 00:37:13.981
<v Speaker 2>like to greg and I at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it felt like there was too many voices,</v>

830
00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.370
<v Speaker 2>po piping in about garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

831
00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.610
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we had the just idly out of,</v>

832
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:26.170
<v Speaker 2>we had this idea of doing this movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>review thing and we did it on my phone.</v>

833
00:37:26.171 --> 00:37:29.650
<v Speaker 2>So like the first five episodes of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast are these three minute,</v>

834
00:37:29.651 --> 00:37:31.600
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about ghostbusters.</v>

835
00:37:31.601 --> 00:37:32.434
<v Speaker 2>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really knowing much about Ross </v>

836
00:37:33.791 --> 00:37:36.760
<v Speaker 2>busters and it was just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>

837
00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:37.893
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started doing longer versions of </v>

838
00:37:40.151 --> 00:37:40.510
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

839
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:43.990
<v Speaker 2>And in that setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're back in La and my studio,</v>

840
00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.210
<v Speaker 2>we'd developed kind of a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>personas that started developing there.</v>

841
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:50.621
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

842
00:37:50.621 --> 00:37:54.220
<v Speaker 2>I think we realized that these guys had </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

843
00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:59.490
<v Speaker 2>that we could tell stories through these</v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes that could be talked about.</v>

844
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.520
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have to actually see happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

845
00:38:03.521 --> 00:38:07.450
<v Speaker 2>you could just say what kind of what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>did off camera be talking about them.</v>

846
00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.090
<v Speaker 2>And you could almost create these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

847
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:11.223
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this drama that you didn't have to </v>

848
00:38:13.001 --> 00:38:15.670
<v Speaker 2>actually shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're actually produce,</v>

849
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>became like a radio play.</v>

850
00:38:18.101 --> 00:38:18.934
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

851
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:23.230
<v Speaker 2>and it just kind of naturally happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to probably fill,</v>

852
00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.273
<v Speaker 2>because we didn't want to just make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>this one joke of a guys who probably </v>

853
00:38:27.791 --> 00:38:30.040
<v Speaker 2>haven't seen the movies giving good </v>
<v Speaker 2>reviews.</v>

854
00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

855
00:38:32.231 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 2>it became kind of after a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we,</v>

856
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.550
<v Speaker 2>we saw what the potential of these two </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters and it could,</v>

857
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.570
<v Speaker 2>it could go anywhere.</v>

858
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.360
<v Speaker 2>And it's been the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

859
00:38:43.361 --> 00:38:45.550
<v Speaker 2>the most fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

860
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:50.830
<v Speaker 2>creatively stimulating project for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

861
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

862
00:38:52.121 --> 00:38:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Just because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

863
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.570
<v Speaker 2>it's such a fun character to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a,</v>

864
00:38:58.571 --> 00:39:00.100
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Greg really is,</v>

865
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funniest person in the world really.</v>

866
00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:04.740
<v Speaker 2>He's a great foil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you guys,</v>

867
00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:06.670
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

868
00:39:06.671 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 2>and it exists on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this a form that like it can exist on</v>

869
00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:11.920
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can exist,</v>

870
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the show itself.</v>

871
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be this,</v>

872
00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:17.663
<v Speaker 2>this soap opera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we've gotten to make a soap </v>

873
00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:22.660
<v Speaker 2>opera that can go forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's true.</v>

874
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

875
00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:26.980
<v Speaker 2>that is very liberating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

876
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:28.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot actors can die and come back as </v>

877
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:32.693
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The culmination of course they have of </v>

878
00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:36.570
<v Speaker 2>the recent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

879
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Arc being the trial for murder or those </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 vanquis parcels.</v>

880
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was incredible.</v>

881
00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.050
<v Speaker 2>That really wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anything.</v>

882
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I've genuinely never seen anything like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

883
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.120
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hate like being like,</v>

884
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:55.180
<v Speaker 2>so boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so kind of boastful of my own stuff.</v>

885
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But somebody has to,</v>

886
00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I know I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

887
00:39:59.040 --> 00:39:59.873
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to the thing I was saying </v>

888
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:01.594
<v Speaker 2>earlier with awesome show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this collaborative thing that I'm </v>

889
00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:05.840
<v Speaker 2>so proud of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric [inaudible],</v>

890
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.753
<v Speaker 2>Nicola who directs it and writes with us</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Greg and our producer Andrew and </v>

891
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.970
<v Speaker 2>these people that make that possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

892
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:18.280
<v Speaker 2>so I feel like it's my job to come out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and help you got up.</v>

893
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.680
<v Speaker 2>But it does feel like we put that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put,</v>

894
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.910
<v Speaker 2>we made that and I've heard it from </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like you and we feel it.</v>

895
00:40:24.911 --> 00:40:26.310
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what,</v>

896
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:27.183
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing else like just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the concept alone of seeing you're </v>

897
00:40:30.701 --> 00:40:34.660
<v Speaker 2>saying in a court room and playing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>like straight straight.</v>

898
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.853
<v Speaker 2>But then people like Boden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kirk who is always sort of checking in </v>

899
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:43.120
<v Speaker 2>with me and I'm checking in with him </v>
<v Speaker 2>about stuff,</v>

900
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote me just being like,</v>

901
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.200
<v Speaker 2>this is like the best thing I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

902
00:40:47.201 --> 00:40:48.034
<v Speaker 2>And for in a long time that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Ma that's exciting to me cause I'm </v>

903
00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.300
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

904
00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:54.370
<v Speaker 2>I feel that way too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

905
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:57.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a thing where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get,</v>

906
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.750
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get treated like anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else either because it's not,</v>

907
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about awards or anything,</v>

908
00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:08.030
<v Speaker 2>but like it isn't a TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this thing that,</v>

909
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:12.520
<v Speaker 2>that people end up watching on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>as it's five hours folks.</v>

910
00:41:12.521 --> 00:41:13.354
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's a thing that you have to </v>

911
00:41:15.521 --> 00:41:18.550
<v Speaker 2>commit to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

912
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:22.960
<v Speaker 2>We're extremely proud of it and want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do more things like that.</v>

913
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Cause we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh this is the fun about other,</v>

914
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.433
<v Speaker 2>had other people have said like what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great environment to do comedy and just </v>

915
00:41:29.471 --> 00:41:32.260
<v Speaker 2>as a trial where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

916
00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:33.800
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just set up in the,</v>

917
00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:37.700
<v Speaker 2>it was so fun to make because we just </v>
<v Speaker 2>did it in a courtroom.</v>

918
00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was unused.</v>

919
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.150
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

920
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 2>it'll real courtroom that had been I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess abandoned or something.</v>

921
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.480
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we just said,</v>

922
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:49.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this year he set up at five cameras</v>

923
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.570
<v Speaker 2>and then just did this play every day </v>
<v Speaker 2>for like three days.</v>

924
00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Unless you guys plan it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was planned out.</v>

925
00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty planned out.</v>

926
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

927
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.843
<v Speaker 2>I would say not written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not dialogue written between he got </v>

928
00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:05.181
<v Speaker 2>planned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

929
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Cause we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had cast people that knew not to give</v>

930
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:09.794
<v Speaker 2>too much away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>

931
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:14.750
<v Speaker 2>we cast people that knew how to behave </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that environment and let them,</v>

932
00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.270
<v Speaker 2>and by the end of the couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

933
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:20.040
<v Speaker 2>everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so fun because we're,</v>

934
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.083
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just,</v>

935
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:22.400
<v Speaker 2>we're playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's playing.</v>

936
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:23.263
<v Speaker 2>You're playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

937
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.470
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

938
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.420
<v Speaker 2>if there was an outtakes version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

939
00:42:26.421 --> 00:42:29.930
<v Speaker 2>you'd see much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of like crying,</v>

940
00:42:29.931 --> 00:42:30.764
<v Speaker 2>laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of,</v>

941
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of like what a read them</v>

942
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:35.130
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have think about like how do we,</v>

943
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.600
<v Speaker 1>how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so good and I'm so proud of it.</v>

944
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.140
<v Speaker 1>How do we get more people to watch this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

945
00:42:40.141 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

946
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.353
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always,</v>

947
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 2>especially with on cinema,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been this sort of frustrating.</v>

948
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not for everyone,</v>

949
00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:53.090
<v Speaker 2>but the people that love it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really care about it and,</v>

950
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>support it in different ways and,</v>

951
00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.100
<v Speaker 2>and feel like it's the greatest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm happy for that.</v>

952
00:43:01.101 --> 00:43:02.990
<v Speaker 2>I wish it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

953
00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.240
<v Speaker 2>millions of viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

954
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that it's a,</v>

955
00:43:07.971 --> 00:43:10.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a contentious dry,</v>

956
00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:11.403
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching bad people watching of </v>

957
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.190
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

958
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:17.840
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of comedy that's like that,</v>

959
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:18.674
<v Speaker 2>that kind of buy all this kind of grow </v>
<v Speaker 2>like not gross but just kind of like </v>

960
00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:23.643
<v Speaker 2>creates uncomfortable experiences and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been our whole career in various </v>

961
00:43:27.921 --> 00:43:28.754
<v Speaker 2>forms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I understand that some people maybe </v>

962
00:43:31.791 --> 00:43:32.624
<v Speaker 2>have enough shit going on in their real </v>
<v Speaker 2>life that they don't have the luxury of </v>

963
00:43:36.161 --> 00:43:38.690
<v Speaker 2>just like relaxing to that kind of humor</v>

964
00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:44.470
<v Speaker 1>that you guys have always had that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascination with like an end and you see</v>

965
00:43:44.471 --> 00:43:47.590
<v Speaker 1>it in the other shows that you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce as well.</v>

966
00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:51.610
<v Speaker 1>That absolutely made yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a real focus on like discomfort,</v>

967
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:54.430
<v Speaker 1>cringe for lack of a better word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

968
00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:56.883
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

969
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:59.090
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't know it,</v>

970
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.380
<v Speaker 2>it comes probably from the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy we liked.</v>

971
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it like,</v>

972
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:07.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Albert Brooks,</v>

973
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:11.450
<v Speaker 2>like Albert Brooks is a lost in America </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

974
00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.313
<v Speaker 2>which I think is maybe my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy film is every scene is that kind </v>

975
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:18.560
<v Speaker 2>of scene that makes your stomach kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt.</v>

976
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.050
<v Speaker 2>It's tenses you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

977
00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.000
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

978
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:23.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't say that.</v>

979
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so some of that,</v>

980
00:44:25.791 --> 00:44:28.070
<v Speaker 2>there's some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

981
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:28.933
<v Speaker 2>most of it's probably though just create</v>
<v Speaker 2>in awesome show at least like creating </v>

982
00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:35.230
<v Speaker 2>absurd situations that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

983
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.280
<v Speaker 2>go dark for very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

984
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:42.090
<v Speaker 2>not very logical reasons are real </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistic reasons,</v>

985
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.100
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

986
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:44.700
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

987
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:48.050
<v Speaker 2>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also like a,</v>

988
00:44:48.051 --> 00:44:48.884
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fundamental comedy construct of </v>

989
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:55.050
<v Speaker 2>failing is funny of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of some of failure.</v>

990
00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like slapstick comedy is,</v>

991
00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.313
<v Speaker 2>is violence and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody slipping on a banana peel or </v>

992
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:07.190
<v Speaker 2>falling down stairs is essentially them </v>
<v Speaker 2>failing somewhere out,</v>

993
00:45:07.191 --> 00:45:08.024
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

994
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:13.150
<v Speaker 2>And so we're doing it on more of like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional level sometimes it's just,</v>

995
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.270
<v Speaker 2>nothing's funny about like people things</v>
<v Speaker 2>going well.</v>

996
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I like to see an attempt </v>
<v Speaker 2>at that,</v>

997
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:22.470
<v Speaker 2>but I feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

998
00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:23.304
<v Speaker 2>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was kind of comedy that's like </v>

999
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.333
<v Speaker 2>people being clever and smart and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and witty and quick and that's a </v>

1000
00:45:31.231 --> 00:45:33.870
<v Speaker 2>different kind of comedy that I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that.</v>

1001
00:45:33.871 --> 00:45:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I Love Big Bang if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1002
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Quippy and cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1003
00:45:39.061 --> 00:45:39.894
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you about absolutely because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of everything you guys </v>

1004
00:45:43.651 --> 00:45:44.484
<v Speaker 2>produce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1005
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.473
<v Speaker 2>predominantly you guys have two huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows right now that I think a lot of </v>

1006
00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:49.230
<v Speaker 2>people are talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the Eric Andre show.</v>

1007
00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.073
<v Speaker 2>Nathan for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to ask you questions about the </v>

1008
00:45:51.691 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how are you involved like personally</v>

1009
00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:56.010
<v Speaker 2>in the planning conception of these?</v>

1010
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not very much at all.</v>

1011
00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1012
00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Were pretty removed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our Pr,</v>

1013
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Speaker 2>our producing partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave kneebone,</v>

1014
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.661
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1015
00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:04.770
<v Speaker 2>we started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1016
00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:08.420
<v Speaker 2>he's a little more involved than we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>

1017
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:09.463
<v Speaker 2>we essentially started the company in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this second season of Tom goes to the </v>

1018
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:13.974
<v Speaker 2>mayor because we had terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences with another production </v>

1019
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:19.240
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1020
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.750
<v Speaker 2>and really saw that there wasn't much to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1021
00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:23.940
<v Speaker 2>You just needed to kind of like hire a </v>
<v Speaker 2>manager,</v>

1022
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get somebody to manage that kind of </v>

1023
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.613
<v Speaker 2>that side of the books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we started that just to produce our </v>

1024
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.400
<v Speaker 2>own stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1025
00:46:32.401 --> 00:46:34.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after awesome show wrapped,</v>

1026
00:46:34.261 --> 00:46:36.290
<v Speaker 2>we won,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1027
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Eric and I needed to take some time </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we wanted to make a movie and we</v>

1028
00:46:40.471 --> 00:46:44.370
<v Speaker 2>needed to kind of write the movie and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and think about it and develop it.</v>

1029
00:46:44.371 --> 00:46:45.204
<v Speaker 2>And w another show came in that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for a producer and that was the </v>

1030
00:46:49.981 --> 00:46:51.840
<v Speaker 2>John Benjamin has a van show.</v>

1031
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.140
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1032
00:46:53.141 --> 00:46:55.650
<v Speaker 2>that for our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from our perspective,</v>

1033
00:46:55.651 --> 00:46:58.530
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could keep all of our talented people</v>

1034
00:46:58.531 --> 00:46:59.364
<v Speaker 2>working while we went off and did </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that didn't require their </v>

1035
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.993
<v Speaker 2>services for a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it kind of created a gap and then it </v>

1036
00:47:06.601 --> 00:47:08.340
<v Speaker 2>just became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1037
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:09.953
<v Speaker 2>holistically out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know Nathan Nathan actually was </v>

1038
00:47:12.631 --> 00:47:14.400
<v Speaker 2>on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jon Benjamin show.</v>

1039
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:15.833
<v Speaker 2>And so he got to know dave or producer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he pitched his show to us and you </v>

1040
00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:22.080
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just try it,</v>

1041
00:47:22.081 --> 00:47:24.210
<v Speaker 2>let's go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1042
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some maybe a let down,</v>

1043
00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:29.690
<v Speaker 2>but we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do what we offer with the company is,</v>

1044
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:30.993
<v Speaker 2>is the opportunity that we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of creative freedom and </v>

1045
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:35.043
<v Speaker 2>nobody telling you nobody budding in </v>
<v Speaker 2>with their ideas and notes everything </v>

1046
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:41.860
<v Speaker 2>that you guys practice doesn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality till it.</v>

1047

<v Speaker 2>we don't decide.</v>

1080
00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:01.953
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1081
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.240
<v Speaker 2>we don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that luxury.</v>

1082
00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have people,</v>

1083
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people now we do a little bit,</v>

1084
00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:11.110
<v Speaker 2>but we take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people come in,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1086
00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 2>we sometimes have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1087
00:49:16.901 --> 00:49:17.734
<v Speaker 2>were developed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certain things or like Nathan </v>

1088
00:49:19.731 --> 00:49:23.530
<v Speaker 2>show is really what Nathan wants to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's his vision and you already know</v>

1089
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:24.364
<v Speaker 2>him and we know him and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you've involved a network like </v>

1090
00:49:27.191 --> 00:49:31.840
<v Speaker 2>comedy central who has their say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the last thing they want is us.</v>

1091
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:32.703
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the conversations I've had with </v>

1092
00:49:33.641 --> 00:49:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Nathan about his show have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1093
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:38.403
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some stuff having to do with like </v>

1094
00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:40.234
<v Speaker 2>promotion and marketing where he wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>my advice on certain that side of it </v>

1095
00:49:43.811 --> 00:49:46.780
<v Speaker 2>sort of like how to handle the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting whatever,</v>

1096
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:49.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the network wants me to do this,</v>

1097
00:49:49.271 --> 00:49:50.104
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>

1098
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.453
<v Speaker 2>And then watching some rough cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving maybe a couple of thoughts that </v>

1099
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.390
<v Speaker 2>aren't certainly aren't required.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1100
00:49:58.391 --> 00:49:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1101
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:00.903
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no we're just just saying we're glad to </v>

1102
00:50:03.101 --> 00:50:05.470
<v Speaker 2>have our names attached,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>our office creates a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a good environment for those </v>

1105
00:50:12.071 --> 00:50:14.350
<v Speaker 2>kinds of people to feel creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1106
00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if you're not giving yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough credit in this situation.</v>

1107
00:50:17.891 --> 00:50:22.750
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this then in that case.</v>

1108
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Well at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love him.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And keep doing.</v>

1110
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:31.060
<v Speaker 2>You're doing what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the story behind this?</v>

1111
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I've always wondered what the hell is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1112
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my dad.</v>

1113
00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.513
<v Speaker 2>I see the resemble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you not know that common </v>

1114
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:39.944
<v Speaker 2>knowledge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of common knowledge for the </v>

1115
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.940
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably all.</v>

1116
00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1117
00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:48.940
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's close up.</v>

1118
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's home movies from the that day,</v>

1119
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:55.903
<v Speaker 2>which was 1989 whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Florida and I was going around </v>

1120
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:02.683
<v Speaker 2>with the video camera asking my family </v>
<v Speaker 2>to describe this vacation in three </v>

1121
00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:07.510
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty quick,</v>

1122
00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:11.420
<v Speaker 2>switch hats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit high or something.</v>

1123
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:14.540
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1124
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:18.020
<v Speaker 2>And then when Eric and I were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting making videos,</v>

1125
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:19.303
<v Speaker 2>I had recently gotten all these video </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapes transferred or something and we </v>

1126
00:51:23.271 --> 00:51:24.104
<v Speaker 2>were looking through them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking through them and there </v>

1127
00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:30.770
<v Speaker 2>were a few moments where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is great gold right now.</v>

1128
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:32.023
<v Speaker 2>And one of them was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one was my poor sister at a recital </v>

1129
00:51:34.401 --> 00:51:39.401
<v Speaker 2>singing some song from fiddler on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>roof and her like pho.</v>

1130
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Totally fucking up a second verse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we didn't use that for anything.</v>

1131
00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:47.060
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1132
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:47.923
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that just became pretty early </v>

1133
00:51:49.731 --> 00:51:52.470
<v Speaker 2>on our slate and it has not changed.</v>

1134
00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.660
<v Speaker 2>That gets a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he likes it.</v>

1135
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.123
<v Speaker 2>He takes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he gets a little residual check </v>

1136
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:02.120
<v Speaker 2>as he getting a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little,</v>

1137
00:52:02.121 --> 00:52:04.460
<v Speaker 2>but I think it might be format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a sketch,</v>

1138
00:52:04.461 --> 00:52:05.294
<v Speaker 2>we did an awesome show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was my funeral and it was when I was </v>

1139
00:52:08.721 --> 00:52:12.950
<v Speaker 2>dead and I had this great bloated face </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1140
00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:17.390
<v Speaker 2>we had my dad and mom make a like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>video eulogy for me.</v>

1141
00:52:17.391 --> 00:52:19.740
<v Speaker 2>That's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that was your actual pants?</v>

1142
00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still getting a little,</v>

1143
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:24.120
<v Speaker 2>I think he gets a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of cents out of that.</v>

1144
00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.710
<v Speaker 2>That's finally allowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks fine to me cause he,</v>

1145
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:31.130
<v Speaker 2>he did this the most sort of insincere </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1146
00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:35.680
<v Speaker 2>oh well we wish you the best and take it</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy,</v>

1147
00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care and we'll,</v>

1148
00:52:36.891 --> 00:52:40.190
<v Speaker 2>you'll be missed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just like really insincere though.</v>

1149
00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me how,</v>

1150
00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:45.560
<v Speaker 2>how was your relationship with your dad?</v>

1151
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.940
<v Speaker 2>You got a lot of dad jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad jokes in your content,</v>

1152
00:52:49.941 --> 00:52:51.930

<v Speaker 2>you know about that debt.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1154

<v Speaker 2>we both had this sort of a,</v>

1155
00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.230
<v Speaker 2>we love our dads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1156
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:02.180

<v Speaker 2>I think we have a good relationship with</v>

1157
00:53:02.181 --> 00:53:04.910
<v Speaker 2>our dads have a better relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad.</v>

1158
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:06.543
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1159
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:10.490

<v Speaker 2>I think we've just always,</v>

1160
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:11.343

<v Speaker 2>it's kind of weird cause it's now kind </v>

1161
00:53:13.431 --> 00:53:18.431
<v Speaker 2>of like a common understanding comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy concept of Dad.</v>

1162
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.270
<v Speaker 2>The jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1163
00:53:20.271 --> 00:53:24.590

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1166
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:32.280
<v Speaker 2>it's fully matured into its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for us it was just something,</v>

1167
00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:33.363
<v Speaker 2>there's something awkward about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship and adult man has with his </v>

1168
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:38.360

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.020
<v Speaker 2>it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be awkward.</v>

1170
00:53:40.021 --> 00:53:40.854
<v Speaker 2>It can be just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now we're just two adult men were </v>

<v Speaker 2>it was just something as me now being a </v>

<v Speaker 2>being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having diapers in my life.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I got this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have this video,</v>

1202
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:06.863
<v Speaker 2>the cat film festival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to ask you some questions about </v>

1203
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:10.890
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was,</v>

1204
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:12.750
<v Speaker 2>if I can pop this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1205
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.620
<v Speaker 2>look at this little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little long way.</v>

1206
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:17.760
<v Speaker 2>So it looked like a monk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little funk.</v>

1207
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:18.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at it obviously cut my own hair </v>

1208
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:25.080
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So deviant cut the brow seems very heavy</v>

1209
00:55:25.081 --> 00:55:26.670
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was well lit.</v>

1210
00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:29.300
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly well lit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1211
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:32.340
<v Speaker 2>this was this the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the history on this video?</v>

1212
00:55:32.341 --> 00:55:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm not quite sure it was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>final,</v>

1213
00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:36.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>project that UN,</v>

1214
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.033
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had been out of college by this </v>

1215
00:55:39.391 --> 00:55:41.460
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living in New York,</v>

1216
00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:42.893
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my girlfriend that was our bedroom </v>

1217
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:46.403
<v Speaker 2>and we an eric would come up from philly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would go back to philly and we'd </v>

1218
00:55:51.151 --> 00:55:55.740
<v Speaker 2>make stuff sort of recreationally for </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

1219
00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Back in the days when it was fun to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

1220
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:03.570
<v Speaker 2>no one was paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no chat rooms and there was no</v>

1221
00:56:03.571 --> 00:56:05.850
<v Speaker 2>message boards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1222
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.470
<v Speaker 2>but we did I think have this idea to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do this cat film festival.</v>

1223
00:56:10.471 --> 00:56:11.304
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're coming out of like the </v>

1224
00:56:12.151 --> 00:56:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia art world a little bit like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out of college.</v>

1225
00:56:16.501 --> 00:56:21.501
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of like trying to like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of festivals and pr and projects and</v>

1226
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:24.963
<v Speaker 3>sort of like arts events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we were kind of into but also </v>

1227
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:32.770
<v Speaker 3>kind of aware of it being silly and kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of pretentious.</v>

1228
00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:37.150
<v Speaker 3>So I think there was this original idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>to actually do a cat film festival,</v>

1229
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:38.793
<v Speaker 3>which happened years ago.</v>

1252
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Zamboni or that picture of the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice skating,</v>

1253
00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:51.460
<v Speaker 3>he says that that was in there cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>eric would make um,</v>

1254
00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.250
<v Speaker 3>like wedding videos and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

00:57:54.251 --> 00:57:55.084
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like film people's recitals for </v>

1256
00:57:56.671 --> 00:57:58.860
<v Speaker 3>money and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shot was in,</v>

1257
00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:04.040
<v Speaker 3>it was a mistake when he was a genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he says it was thick and that I saw</v>

1258
00:58:04.441 --> 00:58:05.460
<v Speaker 3>that and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

1259
00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:08.340
<v Speaker 3>that's the way claims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the case.</v>

1260
00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>

1261
00:58:10.211 --> 00:58:12.460
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he likes to shower me with,</v>

1262
00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:14.230
<v Speaker 3>well why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I thought,</v>

1263
00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:15.083
<v Speaker 3>I know why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought for sure that was a school </v>

1264
00:58:16.481 --> 00:58:17.314
<v Speaker 3>project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that kind of messes up my whole line </v>

1265
00:58:18.371 --> 00:58:20.170
<v Speaker 3>of questioning here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five we did another one,</v>

1266
00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:24.660
<v Speaker 3>but we did one that was about lobsters </v>
<v Speaker 3>and film and being better.</v>

1267
00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:26.150
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's worth,</v>

1268
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:29.080
<v Speaker 3>but go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's probably applicable.</v>

1269
00:58:29.081 --> 00:58:32.280
<v Speaker 3>It's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1270
00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.510
<v Speaker 3>let me hear it and not really.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Did they understand it?</v>

1277
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did make a video.</v>

1278
00:58:47.531 --> 00:58:48.970
<v Speaker 3>You can look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called,</v>

1279
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:50.740
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called cat film festival.</v>

1280
00:58:50.741 --> 00:58:51.574
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called lobsters and film would </v>

1281
00:58:54.881 --> 00:58:56.830
<v Speaker 3>probably get you there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we're not seeing that,</v>

1282
00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I think that one we made for our senior </v>
<v Speaker 3>project,</v>

1283
00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:02.680
<v Speaker 3>it was like mid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mid semester senior project.</v>

1284
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Similar and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a little more rough.</v>

1285
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.350
<v Speaker 3>It was a little rougher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not quite there yet,</v>

1286
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.830
<v Speaker 3>but that one I'm angered our fellow </v>
<v Speaker 3>classmate.</v>

1287
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:13.870
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what and what a fashion.</v>

1288
00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were kind of dicks about it.</v>

1289
00:59:15.791 --> 00:59:20.791
<v Speaker 3>We were given a assignment to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had a full year of,</v>

1290
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 3>of a film class</v>

1291
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.490
<v Speaker 2>that the culmination was making a film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making a short film.</v>

1292
00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:26.893
<v Speaker 2>Now they needed a way to grade US </v>
<v Speaker 2>halfway through to for that first </v>

1293
00:59:29.811 --> 00:59:33.770
<v Speaker 2>semester or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they gave this assignment that we had</v>

1294
00:59:33.771 --> 00:59:37.690
<v Speaker 2>to do a presentation for the class about</v>
<v Speaker 2>some aspect of filmmaking,</v>

1295
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:38.923
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>art direction or editing or </v>

1296
00:59:40.491 --> 00:59:41.324
<v Speaker 2>cinematography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Eric and I were just so into the </v>

1297
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:47.510
<v Speaker 2>idea of making this film and we thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1298
00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:49.640
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're here for is to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this film.</v>

1299
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:52.190
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my films awful.</v>

1300
00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.550
<v Speaker 2>My real film is awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very serious.</v>

1301
00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.370
<v Speaker 2>So embarrassed to show you first joined </v>
<v Speaker 2>film school,</v>

1302
00:59:58.371 --> 01:00:00.560
<v Speaker 2>you were trying to be a serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>filmmaker.</v>

1303
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.660
<v Speaker 2>There was this period of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy wasn't a real thing.</v>

1304
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:07.220
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't seemed unattainable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1305
01:00:07.221 --> 01:00:10.100
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't something you should just </v>
<v Speaker 2>always a funny guy.</v>

1306
01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1307
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:11.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1308
01:00:11.991 --> 01:00:12.740
<v Speaker 2>he's a funny guy.</v>

1309
01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very fine on what's a yes,</v>

1310
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.870
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make size area flicks,</v>

1311
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.793
<v Speaker 2>but I'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like woody allen in the mid </v>

1312
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.820
<v Speaker 2>seventies you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be September.</v>

1313
01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.673
<v Speaker 2>What do out terriers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved Woody Allen and that's why I </v>

1314
01:00:27.461 --> 01:00:30.230
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think I wanted to go in that,</v>

1315
01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:34.610
<v Speaker 2>that sort of direction of making my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and being funny in that,</v>

1316
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:36.530
<v Speaker 2>was there a point during college where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1317
01:00:36.531 --> 01:00:40.010
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of all these people and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people I'm around,</v>

1318
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:42.290
<v Speaker 2>this isn't what this is isn't connecting</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

1319
01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit.</v>

1320
01:00:43.281 --> 01:00:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean at Temple University they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>very socially,</v>

1321
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in India they're interested in,</v>

1322
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:53.450
<v Speaker 2>in sort of political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice,</v>

1323
01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:58.250
<v Speaker 2>the kind of storytelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filmmaking and comedy was not considered</v>

1324
01:00:58.251 --> 01:01:01.400
<v Speaker 2>something that you could do that with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really stupid.</v>

1325
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:02.923
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the do that more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything is the perfect breeding ground </v>

1326
01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:07.190
<v Speaker 2>for your style.</v>

1327
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1328
01:01:08.091 --> 01:01:11.780
<v Speaker 2>and there were also like technically not</v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of,</v>

1329
01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:12.651
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1330
01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:13.484
<v Speaker 2>they didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hadn't entered into like the final </v>

1331
01:01:15.801 --> 01:01:20.801
<v Speaker 2>cut pro era of where everyone could just</v>
<v Speaker 2>load up a bunch of footage.</v>

1332
01:01:21.381 --> 01:01:25.370
<v Speaker 2>We still were doing like a weird video </v>
<v Speaker 2>toaster slash cutting film.</v>

1333
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:27.920
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a weird place where we couldn't</v>

1334
01:01:27.921 --> 01:01:32.900
<v Speaker 2>really make anything that great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how you guys pass?</v>

1335
01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:36.470
<v Speaker 2>You got to the finish that story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in the middle of the semester.</v>

1336
01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Instead of doing a presentation on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>art direction in front of the students,</v>

1337
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.163
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we made this absurd film that was me </v>

1338
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:46.903
<v Speaker 2>with my presentation was that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>lobsters in film and then I could show </v>

1339
01:01:50.421 --> 01:01:51.254
<v Speaker 2>you examples is adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds almost like a conspiracy </v>

1340
01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:53.804
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like a meaningless waste of </v>

1341
01:01:56.601 --> 01:02:00.470
<v Speaker 2>time and interviewed some professors </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1342
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.333
<v Speaker 2>And then Eric's was like that vhs is </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than film and we just made these </v>

1343
01:02:06.351 --> 01:02:08.630
<v Speaker 2>stupid like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1344
01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:09.530
<v Speaker 2>you could look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1345
01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:11.510
<v Speaker 2>and then what we thought was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>clever,</v>

1346
01:02:11.511 --> 01:02:12.344
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shot the presentation in the same </v>

1347
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:18.810
<v Speaker 2>lecture hall as where we were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone else was giving the thing.</v>

1348
01:02:18.811 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 2>So when we played it in</v>

1349
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in the room,</v>

1350
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.793
<v Speaker 1>it was playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in the room that it was being </v>

1351
01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.230
<v Speaker 1>played in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1352
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:27.533
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it had this musical interlude </v>

1353
01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:32.390
<v Speaker 1>of us like dancing and it was just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>very primordial,</v>

1354
01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:34.123
<v Speaker 1>but they were pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got an a because the professor had </v>

1355
01:02:36.471 --> 01:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>thought it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The students felt like we,</v>

1356
01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>they're pissed that we got away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>really not doing the assignment.</v>

1357
01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.633
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just angry because they didn't </v>

1358
01:02:46.201 --> 01:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>think about it and none of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing anything.</v>

1359
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>You don't hear their names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not two films a year,</v>

1360
01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:59.080
<v Speaker 1>not the thought buddy jokes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of making videos.</v>

1361
01:02:59.341 --> 01:03:04.341
<v Speaker 1>Kind of started at my school too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied art and video art class.</v>

1362
01:03:04.361 --> 01:03:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Then I ended up doing like our early </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and show them in class as,</v>

1363
01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:13.680
<v Speaker 1>as like my assignment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was also kind of kind of like what</v>

1364
01:03:13.681 --> 01:03:14.514
<v Speaker 1>you're describing because in art </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was also very serious and huck </v>

1365
01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:23.340
<v Speaker 1>high emotion and talking in classes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just never very,</v>

1366
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I was never very visually uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adept.</v>

1367
01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.013
<v Speaker 1>And so you'd take those classes in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my go to move would be to like make </v>

1368
01:03:32.611 --> 01:03:35.520
<v Speaker 1>something intentionally bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to be like,</v>

1369
01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:36.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my art,</v>

1370
01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:37.610
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also like,</v>

1371
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.090
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know how to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1372
01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:42.360
<v Speaker 1>You're shielding yourself in a way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like criticism.</v>

1373
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

1374
01:03:44.011 --> 01:03:44.844
<v Speaker 1>funnily enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ila had these video art classes in </v>

1375
01:03:46.501 --> 01:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>college and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just emulating you guys as much as</v>

1376
01:03:49.381 --> 01:03:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I could because that's all I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was funny.</v>

1377
01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:52.913
<v Speaker 1>And we just made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the first one would ne was this </v>

1378
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:58.920
<v Speaker 1>fetal called chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I was like grotesquely naked.</v>

1379
01:03:58.921 --> 01:03:59.754
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was wearing underwear and just bring </v>

1380
01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.450
<v Speaker 1>my buying chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we must have just horrified,</v>

1381
01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.540
<v Speaker 1>horrified everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1382
01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:07.374
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly in college is a lot of just </v>

1383
01:04:09.871 --> 01:04:11.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy.</v>

1384
01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>What can I tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1385
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.810
<v Speaker 1>my favorite anecdote of Ella's a college</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1386
01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.840
<v Speaker 1>one of her best friends and credit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>her for thinking of this idea shirt,</v>

1387
01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:24.640
<v Speaker 1>her final video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should put a camera on the toilet and</v>

1388
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:28.440
<v Speaker 1>filmed herself taking a poop at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor's comment,</v>

1389
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.530
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sticks with me to this day.</v>

1390
01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:34.260
<v Speaker 1>One of the best things I've ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>his note to her was,</v>

1391
01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:36.420
<v Speaker 1>was simply this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe next time,</v>

1392
01:04:36.421 --> 01:04:37.254
<v Speaker 1>less hair.</v>

1393
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's horrifying.</v>

1394
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.800
<v Speaker 1>So that was what we were up against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by,</v>

1395
01:04:45.801 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>by contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it probably wasn't,</v>

1396
01:04:47.941 --> 01:04:52.380
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't that discussed right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to never see that.</v>

1397
01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you again,</v>

1398
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:59.990
<v Speaker 1>did you ever have any director disputes </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the making of pigment with Tommy?</v>

1399
01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1400
01:05:02.641 --> 01:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

1401
01:05:04.261 --> 01:05:07.650
<v Speaker 1>I dunno how much to tell you about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1402
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:09.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why'd you say that?</v>

1403
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Or is there some things that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like to talk about it.</v>

1404
01:05:12.211 --> 01:05:13.021
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1405
01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:13.854
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a little nice to have a </v>

1406
01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 1>little mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we</v>

1407
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:23.220
<v Speaker 2>brought him in and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and made him the director of that direct</v>

1408
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:25.083
<v Speaker 2>us and then we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause we really wanted to be around him </v>

1409
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:30.003
<v Speaker 2>to watch how he worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really why we brought deserve </v>

1410
01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:34.253
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1411
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.273
<v Speaker 2>you guys were kind of ahead of the game </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the timing wise up because now he's </v>

1412
01:05:38.861 --> 01:05:42.820
<v Speaker 2>kind of a superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was last year and now it's,</v>

1413
01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:43.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1414
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:45.650
<v Speaker 2>it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably it,</v>

1415
01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's not going to,</v>

1416
01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:48.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1417
01:05:48.071 --> 01:05:48.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

1418
01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Speaker 2>We were trying to get him on the potty </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

1419
01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:52.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean he keep blew us off twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1420
01:05:52.601 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>He lost her number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1421
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.130
<v Speaker 2>well he was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the most satisfying experience.</v>

1422
01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.233
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspected I suspected that and go how </v>

1423
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:03.011
<v Speaker 2>I want it to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1424
01:06:03.011 --> 01:06:08.011
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was definitely the was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>room vibe in La,</v>

1425
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we got here back in 2003 so I don't</v>

1426
01:06:14.681 --> 01:06:15.514
<v Speaker 2>feel like we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in that maybe second wave of </v>

1427
01:06:17.081 --> 01:06:19.450
<v Speaker 2>people that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when we went to the screenings,</v>

1428
01:06:19.451 --> 01:06:22.060
<v Speaker 2>it was sold out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all the way back then.</v>

1429
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:25.060
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fun.</v>

1430
01:06:25.061 --> 01:06:27.220
<v Speaker 2>And then I remember going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last time I went,</v>

1431
01:06:27.221 --> 01:06:29.380
<v Speaker 2>which is also several years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1432
01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.380
<v Speaker 2>it had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took a mean turn.</v>

1433
01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:32.243
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was just the night I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just felt like people were </v>

1434
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:39.220
<v Speaker 2>laughing at that woman who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1435
01:06:39.221 --> 01:06:41.950
<v Speaker 2>kind of implying that she had gotten fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just,</v>

1436
01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:45.000
<v Speaker 2>it had this kind of nastiness to it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience.</v>

1437
01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.140
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of mob mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That claim was like,</v>

1438
01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.720
<v Speaker 2>hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I liked it.</v>

1439
01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about this,</v>

1440
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.580
<v Speaker 2>but it might've just been the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1441
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough audience crowd,</v>

1442
01:06:56.770 --> 01:06:58.570
<v Speaker 2>but did you guys ever kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1443
01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.840
<v Speaker 2>and the editing bay does well I guess </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to talk about,</v>

1444
01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:02.560
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

1445
01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.393

<v Speaker 2>Did he ever give his opinion when you </v>

1446
01:07:05.801 --> 01:07:06.610
<v Speaker 2>guys putting it together?</v>

1447
01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Like how did he like the piece after I </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out,</v>

1448
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1449
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.860
<v Speaker 2>I didn't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't talk.</v>

1450
01:07:12.861 --> 01:07:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Go about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1451
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:15.580
<v Speaker 2>one of a kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1452
01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:16.414
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've met with them several times after </v>

1453
01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:21.580
<v Speaker 2>working with them about doing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and it never,</v>

1454
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.490
<v Speaker 2>it would always get weird and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1455
01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:25.450
<v Speaker 2>we wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did this thing,</v>

1456
01:07:25.451 --> 01:07:26.430
<v Speaker 2>the neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1457
01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.570
<v Speaker 2>you ever see the neighbors?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1458
01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:31.060
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have one off the wall.</v>

1459
01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.071
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1460
01:07:33.071 --> 01:07:36.370
<v Speaker 2>we'd love to help you produce that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he'd be like,</v>

1461
01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:38.680
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can get me,</v>

1462
01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:43.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right editors and the right people.</v>

1463
01:07:43.181 --> 01:07:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Like he wanted to do it for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that idea,</v>

1464
01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:48.423
<v Speaker 2>but it is about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what made that so special was </v>

1465
01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.473
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will literally just find you the </v>

1466
01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:54.784
<v Speaker 2>money and then you make it and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is you'd give it to us and we will </v>

1467
01:07:58.811 --> 01:08:00.400
<v Speaker 2>hand it to the network.</v>

1468
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't want to have any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to like,</v>

1469
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:05.830
<v Speaker 2>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like disturbing a tribe in the Amazon.</v>

1470
01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.013
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have any influence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to try to like replicate </v>

1471
01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:10.684
<v Speaker 2>what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also don't want to assist you to </v>

1472
01:08:12.851 --> 01:08:13.684
<v Speaker 2>make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also understand his desire to </v>

1473
01:08:15.201 --> 01:08:16.430
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't I,</v>

1474
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.770
<v Speaker 2>why can't we just have the best people </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on this?</v>

1475
01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.990
<v Speaker 2>But then it just becomes like anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

1476
01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:22.780
<v Speaker 2>the trig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

1477
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:25.730
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became too complicated.</v>

1478
01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine.</v>

1479
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of his style.</v>

1480
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:32.000
<v Speaker 2>But like working with people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tommy's like their bread and butter of,</v>

1481
01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.130
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what you guys did an awesome show.</v>

1482
01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys ever,</v>

1483
01:08:36.081 --> 01:08:39.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean for all for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard this while to story.</v>

1484
01:08:39.201 --> 01:08:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Tell me if this is something you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1485
01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:41.630
<v Speaker 2>You guys used to do.</v>

1486
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Put people through uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>

1487
01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:47.420
<v Speaker 2>They get a good performer react </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance for example,</v>

1488
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:51.580
<v Speaker 2>is it true that you will put people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>cranes up in the sky,</v>

1489
01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:54.590
<v Speaker 2>the green screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get a ride to get?</v>

1490
01:08:54.591 --> 01:08:55.341
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be,</v>

1491
01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:56.174
<v Speaker 2>I actually opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was up in the crane with the actor on </v>

1492
01:08:59.481 --> 01:09:02.930
<v Speaker 2>green and there's just a couple people </v>
<v Speaker 2>we do that with,</v>

1493
01:09:02.931 --> 01:09:05.580
<v Speaker 2>which is to create a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1494
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:06.873
<v Speaker 2>just the Doug [inaudible] who's one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the announcers on check it out and he's </v>

1495
01:09:11.391 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like the sports guy and he's a real</v>

1496
01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:15.134
<v Speaker 2>straight guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real like serious kind of a normal </v>

1497
01:09:18.471 --> 01:09:20.300
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>

1498
01:09:20.301 --> 01:09:22.520
<v Speaker 2>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just have the system where when we're</v>

1499
01:09:22.521 --> 01:09:25.820
<v Speaker 2>shooting him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tried to create just like distraction</v>

1500
01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.660
<v Speaker 2>so we can get a moment of him being </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1501
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:29.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that?</v>

1502
01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:34.070
<v Speaker 2>And those get harder and harder to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more they get more elaborate.</v>

1503
01:09:34.730 --> 01:09:38.030
<v Speaker 2>And just so they culminated in me with </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those cranes,</v>

1504
01:09:38.031 --> 01:09:38.864
<v Speaker 2>one of those like [inaudible] where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>change the light bulb just being like </v>

1505
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:42.343
<v Speaker 2>operating where those go.</v>

1506
01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:44.063
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1507
01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:47.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we just want to create this chaos </v>

1508
01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:54.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an uncomfortable environment that,</v>

1509
01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:58.560
<v Speaker 2>that gives just that little spark in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their eye.</v>

1510
01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might,</v>

1511
01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:04.080
<v Speaker 2>something's gonna fall on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just one that moment.</v>

1512
01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1513
01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.240
<v Speaker 2>and we've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We probably took it too far,</v>

1514
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:12.450
<v Speaker 2>too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very intrigued by that.</v>

1515
01:10:12.690 --> 01:10:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1516
01:10:14.161 --> 01:10:14.994
<v Speaker 2>we would just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain people where we would </v>

1517
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:17.783
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1518
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:21.420
<v Speaker 2>we'd maybe kinda gotten sick of them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten tired of,</v>

1519
01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.433
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had done something a little bit </v>

1520
01:10:23.491 --> 01:10:25.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe to deserve it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1521
01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:25.973
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would just like amuse ourselves by </v>

1522
01:10:28.111 --> 01:10:32.610
<v Speaker 2>like sending in a entree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sending an appetizers while we were</v>

1523
01:10:32.611 --> 01:10:34.140
<v Speaker 2>shooting and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1524
01:10:34.141 --> 01:10:35.730
<v Speaker 2>yelling at the crew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1525
01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:36.690
<v Speaker 2>get Outta here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1526
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.823
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said he was like creating these </v>

1527
01:10:38.671 --> 01:10:41.970
<v Speaker 2>little plays that really were just for </v>
<v Speaker 2>us in a year.</v>

1528
01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and but nothing ever.</v>

1529
01:10:45.601 --> 01:10:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing ever that we felt like bad about</v>

1530
01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:51.270
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would always end.</v>

1531
01:10:51.271 --> 01:10:55.020
<v Speaker 2>It always ended them feeling good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like wanting to work with us again.</v>

1532
01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1533
01:10:56.630 --> 01:11:00.720
<v Speaker 2>you walk a thin line because the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that act frequently,</v>

1534
01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they know whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're right on the joke or not,</v>

1535
01:11:05.041 --> 01:11:08.700
<v Speaker 2>but I think the real kicker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have kind of the same effect.</v>

1536
01:11:08.701 --> 01:11:10.110
<v Speaker 2>We work with people like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

1537
01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:11.940
<v Speaker 2>They want it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to come back.</v>

1538
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:13.590
<v Speaker 2>They want to be a part it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1539
01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:14.341
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:15.174
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've had a few people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't happy with the way things went </v>

1541
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.250
<v Speaker 2>and we feel bad about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1542
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.200
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part,</v>

1543
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:24.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

1544
01:11:24.061 --> 01:11:25.020
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're never,</v>

1545
01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:27.390
<v Speaker 2>we're never presenting things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1546
01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:28.940
<v Speaker 2>w with false pretenses.</v>

1547
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:29.783
<v Speaker 2>We're not saying it's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't always like this is a comedy </v>

1548
01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:33.630
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1549
01:11:33.631 --> 01:11:35.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1550
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.233
<v Speaker 2>there's certain tricks that we do to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you say is a little pr little </v>

1551
01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:41.920
<v Speaker 2>reality out of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1552
01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:44.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel is fairly benign,</v>

1553
01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:45.174
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1554
01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.080
<v Speaker 2>not the most honorable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honorable way to behave,</v>

1555
01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:52.030
<v Speaker 2>which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be a little,</v>

1556
01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:53.940
<v Speaker 2>you can be a level dishonorable </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>

1557
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you find these bizarre people?</v>

1560
01:11:58.861 --> 01:12:00.300
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you find these folks?</v>

<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1699
01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.390
<v Speaker 3>we started doing live shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

1700
01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1701
01:18:38.401 --> 01:18:40.350
<v Speaker 3>we didn't naturally come out of doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

1702
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:42.100
<v Speaker 3>You're not like standups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1703
01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.230

<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1704

<v Speaker 3>we've got to do a live show,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1706
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:50.880
<v Speaker 3>and one of that was one of the ideas was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we'd sort of like throw a pizza out</v>

1707
01:18:50.881 --> 01:18:54.360
<v Speaker 3>in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is basically what gallagher used to</v>

1708
01:18:54.361 --> 01:18:54.960
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1709
01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.780
<v Speaker 3>isn't that complicated?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1710
01:18:56.781 --> 01:18:57.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just like the,</v>

1711
01:18:58.050 --> 01:19:00.330
<v Speaker 3>the world of the khaki pants and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad,</v>

1712
01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:05.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it comes out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we did with the Shrek videos too,</v>

1713
01:19:05.581 --> 01:19:08.270
<v Speaker 3>which is like a blatant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1714
01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.640
<v Speaker 3>like self promotion for somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just sort of like proud of companies.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well Alex Jones,</v>

1738

<v Speaker 1>I've seen you goofing on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a great impression.</v>

1739
01:20:21.710 --> 01:20:24.020
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It takes me a little bit to get into it.</v>

1740
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Happy to be here.</v>

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you why they're doing it.</v>

1744
01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:40.790
<v Speaker 5>Because the powers that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the influence that we have,</v>

1745
01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:44.170
<v Speaker 5>the ability to reach the people out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there scares,</v>

1746
01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.710
<v Speaker 5>scares them too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1747
01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:47.050
<v Speaker 5>That is too good.</v>

1748
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here I've got a little soundbite here.</v>

1749
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Destroy the child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my little soundboard.</v>

1750
01:20:52.901 --> 01:20:53.540
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1751
01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:55.630
<v Speaker 1>in fact he got banned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the,</v>

1752
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1753
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:58.190
<v Speaker 1>that was a thing that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

1754
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:59.423
<v Speaker 1>and first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just preface this because I </v>

1755
01:21:01.131 --> 01:21:01.964
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with being trans </v>

1756
01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:06.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's not the point of what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to tell you.</v>

1757
01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:07.063
<v Speaker 1>Transient or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or transgender close to them are </v>

1758
01:21:08.811 --> 01:21:09.644
<v Speaker 1>perfectly acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he is someone who has said that </v>

1759
01:21:12.051 --> 01:21:15.020
<v Speaker 1>being a transgender person is a mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

1760
01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:16.093
<v Speaker 1>And have you seen in the news that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was actually found to be a jerk in his </v>

1761
01:21:20.061 --> 01:21:22.600
<v Speaker 1>toolbox to transport?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>let me thank you.</v>

1768
01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:35.870

<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>

1869
01:26:28.210 --> 01:26:29.690
<v Speaker 6>Articles about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's ridiculous.</v>

1870
01:26:29.691 --> 01:26:30.524
<v Speaker 6>I was like looking up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some reporter popped up porn on my </v>

1871
01:26:34.941 --> 01:26:35.960
<v Speaker 6>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody's had porn,</v>

1872
01:26:35.970 --> 01:26:40.970
<v Speaker 6>popular phones hundreds of times in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>studio.</v>

1873
01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.670
<v Speaker 6>And then like something pops up like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

1874
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.923
<v Speaker 6>I looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't the news blurted out cause </v>

1875
01:26:49.311 --> 01:26:50.144
<v Speaker 6>there was nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They blurt it to then say something was </v>

1876
01:26:51.891 --> 01:26:52.800
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he went to it.</v>

1877
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:53.703
<v Speaker 6>But some porn menu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I probably had porn men use pop up 500 </v>

1878
01:26:56.301 --> 01:26:57.134
<v Speaker 6>times in the line.</v>

1879
01:26:57.150 --> 01:26:57.983
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it was a four chan detective </v>

1880
01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.400
<v Speaker 1>kind of live and die by the pepe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frog.</v>

1881
01:27:05.401 --> 01:27:06.234
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I've seen the detective work and </v>

1882
01:27:08.161 --> 01:27:08.994
<v Speaker 1>there is no doubt that this guy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking to relieve his insatiable </v>

1883
01:27:12.391 --> 01:27:13.224
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Determined it wasn't some pop up and it </v>

1884
01:27:14.931 --> 01:27:17.230
<v Speaker 1>was most definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>China gets to something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1888
01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:27.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the nihilism that that if they live</v>

1889
01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:28.383
<v Speaker 1>to eat just as much pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just about getting whoever's no </v>

1966
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:56.450
<v Speaker 3>memorizing lines and some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not much.</v>

1967
01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:57.590
<v Speaker 3>And it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1968
01:30:57.591 --> 01:30:59.890
<v Speaker 3>he's not super specific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1969
01:30:59.891 --> 01:31:00.830
<v Speaker 3>it's like say what?</v>

1970
01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:01.693
<v Speaker 3>Say what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How you would say that's good because </v>

1971
01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:04.624
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the one thing I'm not good at is </v>

1972
01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:08.930
<v Speaker 3>memorizing lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid I could never do that.</v>

1973
01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.060
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1974
01:31:11.061 --> 01:31:14.390
<v Speaker 3>And it's to get better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can train your brain to do</v>

1975
01:31:14.391 --> 01:31:16.280
<v Speaker 3>that better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not,</v>

1976
01:31:16.281 --> 01:31:18.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm still very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very like,</v>

1977
01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:19.940
<v Speaker 3>what do I see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1978
01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:23.630
<v Speaker 3>it was in a better call Saul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last episode there was a,</v>

1979
01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.943
<v Speaker 3>that gail character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch the show caught up except </v>

1980
01:31:27.441 --> 01:31:28.141
<v Speaker 3>for the new APP?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1981
01:31:28.141 --> 01:31:28.974
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know gail characters from breaking </v>

1982
01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:33.350
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the guy that business is now.</v>

1983
01:31:33.710 --> 01:31:34.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he does this thing where he's like </v>

1984
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:37.280
<v Speaker 3>singing all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1985
01:31:37.281 --> 01:31:38.114
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical compounds to a walkman </v>

1986
01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:44.780
<v Speaker 3>millennium and he's doing it like </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly.</v>

1987
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:48.050
<v Speaker 3>And I'm watching that going like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never be able to do that pretty,</v>

1988
01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:48.913
<v Speaker 3>it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be like a week of shooting and </v>

1989
01:31:50.831 --> 01:31:53.900
<v Speaker 3>like you could edit something together </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was such a short scene,</v>

1990
01:31:53.901 --> 01:31:56.780
<v Speaker 3>like the dedication and rehearsing just </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that brief.</v>

1991
01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:59.040
<v Speaker 3>And I bet you nobody thinks about that.</v>

1992
01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:01.653
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did have this sinking feeling like I </v>

1993
01:32:06.221 --> 01:32:08.770
<v Speaker 1>would never be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what else can't I do?</v>

1994
01:32:08.771 --> 01:32:11.150
<v Speaker 1>What if I get something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1995
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:16.450
<v Speaker 1>you said you're a big ass while I'm Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate you so much.</v>

1997
01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:21.910
<v Speaker 1>but I'll say it again.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think this was a positive experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

2000
01:32:27.010 --> 01:32:29.620
<v Speaker 1>It was very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel I'm old.</v>

2001

<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I hope I didn't hurt anybody's feelings.</v>

2007

<v Speaker 1>I hope I didn't reveal too much.</v>
