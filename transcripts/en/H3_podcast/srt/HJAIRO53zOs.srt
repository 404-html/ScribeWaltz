Correct.
Opinion Zone.

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,550
You plan on disagreeing with me or 
arguing with me?

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,883
God is not an option.
I'll close it because I do want you all 

7
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:29,604
watching the numbers are important,
but just know before warrant you are 

8
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,550
wrong because this is the correct 
opinion zone.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,970
Today's episode is sponsored by 23 and 
me,

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,073
quip and seat Geek.
Guess what's going down a week from 

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,810

Bill Burr,

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,420
the living legend,
the Titan of comedy,

13
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,390
one of the greatest comedians of all 
time.

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,580
Is it going to sit right where Isla is 
right now?

15
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,980
Okay,
I'm fucking terrified.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,730
Bill bird is going to be here on 
Tuesday.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,160
Also important to note is that today is 
young shredders a birthday.

18
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:08,030
He turned one years old,
so let's keep

19
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,330
the roundup upload going.

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,210
We are going to be playing everybody's 
favorite game.

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,350
Know your meme featuring the one and 
only shoon eyes.

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,290
That's right.
Shoe and ice is back in a big way.

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,280
Call us in at eight Oh eight hot meme.
They,

24
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,200
yes,
that is our real phone number and yes,

25
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:31,380
we are taking calls.
They're eight oh eight hot mean.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,270
Ooh.
Speaking of hot,

27
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,870
I've been having diarrhea.
A lot of diarrhea.

28
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,550
Labor Day.
No hot.

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,580
Well No,
the,

30
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,570
the poop is hot like I northera.
Yeah.

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,020
Got It.
Yep.

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,453
Why is diarrhea hot by the way?
Like I never had a chance to let you 

33
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:48,900
know.
When you bake bread,

34
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,300
you're supposed to let it cool and like,
yeah,

35
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,790
go room temp.
So that's what diarrhea is.

36
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,250
It's pooped that never got it.
Never got to go room temp.

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,953
But that's why it's hot under cooked.
That is the scientific poop is what 

38
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,104
diarrhea is.

39
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,380
I eman happy Labor Day.
Hope you guys all had a nice break.

40
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:08,963
I had one too many hot dogs or something
cause I've been having diarrhea since 

41
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:13,470
4:00
AM then really pooping my brains out.

42
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,810
What's the deal with Labor Day,
by the way?

43
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,740
TheF that fricking mailman's walking 
around delivering mail yesterday.

44
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm like,
oh Labor Day,

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,193
Labor Day.
Federal employees don't even get the 

46
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:26,340
damn day off.
Labor Day.

47
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,174
What the hell?
What are we celebrating if the mailman 

48
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:30,660
can't go,
you know,

49
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:33,120
take a seat.
That's weird.

50
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,920
I find that really very bizarre.
Just like decided to work on his own.

51
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,470
I don't think it works though.
Federal government,

52
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,623
I don't think you just pick up your mail
bag and just start passing out 

53
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,240
envelopes.
Cheryl was a Usbs,

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,330
s u s p.
S cause there's those Amazon guy.

55
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:51,180
You know what?
I'm not sure.

56
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:53,550
I didn't see him pull man.

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,100
Oh Isaac.
Well either way it's like,

58
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,320
you know,
late Labor Day,

59
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,900
everyone who gets labor day off or like 
white collar workers,

60
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:02,734
you know the real people that need labor
day off are the ones that are like 

61
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:10,660
slaving away at Amazon and Mcdonald's 
and all these shitty jobs.

62
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:11,980
Right.
It's just so funny.

63
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,010
Labor Day has turned into such as a 
stupid day.

64
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,993
Labor Day was originally made to 
celebrate unions and celebrate like 

65
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,384
worker rights and shit and like 
meanwhile you got the post man and 

66
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:25,030
around envelopes.
Well that's enough about Labor Day.

67
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,370
The real takeaway is that diarrhea is 
under cooked poop.

68
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,480
That make sense guys?
Let's get started.

69
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,320
We got a lot to talk about.
Me Royale is coming to fruition.

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,750
Ksi Versus Logan.
Paul.

71
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,970
Everyone was saying,
oh that's the fight of the year,

72
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,043
but in the century Nivea in the fight of
the year because we are in the early 

73
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,374
stages of organizing what is going to be
known forever as meme royale 2018 

74
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:55,630
because this my friends is an annual 
event.

75
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,280
We've got people that are in so far.
Joey Salads,

76
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,443
prank invasion,
shoon ice there Bradbury's so flow all 

77
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:09,220
squaring off hundred thousand dollars of
prizes.

78
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,803
I think the big,
the big fight should be prank invasion 

79
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,800
was joey salads and then I think a great
undercard would be shooting ice.

80
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,643
Fourth verse Ethan Bradbury,
which be the battle of madness because 

81
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:21,244
they're both a little crazy and I know 
shoot nice is like over the hill so to 

82
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,864
speak,
but he terrifies me and by the way he's 

83
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:28,750
been working on,
he looks really good.

84
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,820
People are going to place bets like 
sure,

85
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:31,730
why not?
It's loss of it.

86
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,610
I mean I'm not going to take bets but 
somebody will,

87
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,890
you know,
it's crazy.

88
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:36,724
I'm sure there'll be a spread if we so 
guys get excited me Maura out 2018 is 

89
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,064
happening.
I want to see colby person getting his 

90
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:47,720
hands dirty.
Is Faces too pretty whenever Jeff,

91
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,800
God,
coby person.

92
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,633
Who would you,
I would like to see koby vs like Mo 

93
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:53,814
cause you know,
I was originally thinking and then they 

94
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:58,960
see tv.
Oh that's a good matchup.

95
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,250
I originally wanted to pit Ethan 
Bradbury verse Moe Bradbury,

96
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:06,190
like the the boys.
But I think,

97
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,730
I think Ethan would smash him.
You can't contend with the smell,

98
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,570
that pure madness that is behind his 
eyes.

99
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,673
Like you even see in their videos when 
Ethan's like intimidating Mo and I was 

100
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:18,971
like,
damn,

101
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:19,804
he would never have a chance.
So we'd have to pit moe against someone 

102
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:23,080
like Dennis.
Yeah,

103
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,520
that would be pretty hot.
Super excited about that.

104
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,660
In fact,
guys,

105
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,540
uh,
you may have been following the story as

106
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,900
it's been evolving here on this h three 
podcasts,

107
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,753
a correct opinion episode.
We've had it up a little bit of a 

108
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,530
altercation with prank invasion.
Who called me out to box me,

109
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,150
which was the,
you know,

110
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,180
I want to say,
how would you say the,

111
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,643
the breaking point for this meme right 
out cause prank invasion challenged me 

112
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:51,814
to a battle.
And of course that's not something that 

113
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:54,064
I'm interested in doing,
seeing is that I'm a pudgy little guy 

114
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,723
and prank invasion literally just got 
out of prison for three years for some 

115
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,820
kind of sexual crime.
Um,

116
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,380
that is not well,
it's literally,

117
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,650
well I don't know what I mean.
No,

118
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,710
it's,
it is a joke.

119
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,080
I didn't try.
It is a joke.

120
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,020
What I'm saying.
Do I need to say that every time?

121
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,250
Maybe once guys.
I do not think,

122
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,370
I'm not saying that it's,
I wouldn't be surprised.

123
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,530
Can I say that if you went to prison for
a sexual crime,

124
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,990
you can say that.
That's not,

125
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,883
that's not definitely,
I wouldn't be surprised if I want to be 

126
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,840
surprised at all.
I'm anticipating it.

127
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,820
Um,
so he,

128
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,850
he edited this footage together of what 
I said last episode and he said,

129
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:45,380
respect to h three h street productions 
for admitting he's scared.

130
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,250
Takes a real man to admit that respect,
bro.

131
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:50,084
Now send me your address to the podcast 
and I'll actually play you a quick game 

132
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:54,270
for a quick kiss.
Ooh,

133
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,660
dude,
this guy wants to come to our podcast.

134
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,523
I mean,
shit is so demanding and his tweets now 

135
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,280
quit playing.
I mean,

136
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:08,061
here's the thing,
dude.

137
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,540
And I send me your address.
Well,

138
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,570
I don't know how we,
I don't know how he,

139
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,820
yeah,
I'm scared of you.

140
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,920
I'm scared of you.
That's not like,

141
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,143
that's not like unmanly to admit that 
I'm scared of some unhinged psychopath 

142
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,660
who serve roid it up and just got out of
prison for a sexual crime.

143
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,143
Like if you,
if you walked by some on unhedged 

144
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:31,430
lunatic with like a hell's fire between 
his eyes under his,

145
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,860
behind his eye is not crazy.
It'd be like,

146
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:34,790
Yo,
I'm scared.

147
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,720
Scared of you dude.
Um,

148
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,020
and not,
I mean,

149
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,600
and,
and it's because you're insane.

150
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,920
You know,
let's get it straight then.

151
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:49,510
You're not a man,
you're not a man face like I'm not.

152
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,171
Okay,
well anyway,

153
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:51,910
let's just watch this.
His little edit here,

154
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,103
bro.
You look like you've disappeared for a 

155
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,993
year and and you were in prison and 
you've been lifting weights that whole 

156
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:59,870
time.
Like the last video you may have.

157
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,280
I was scared.
I was scared.

158
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,390
I was scared.
I was scared.

159
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,030
I was scared.
This guy was in prison for a year,

160
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,720
Bro.
You literally repeated me saying,

161
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,613
I was scared that you were in prison for
a year for a sexual crime and we're 

162
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:16,561
lifting weights that whole time.
I am scared that you want to come to the

163
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:17,914
podcast and kiss me.
I'm terrified of all these things and I 

164
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,234
openly admit it.
If that makes me less of a man that God 

165
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:25,780
bless.
Okay.

166
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,583
I wouldn't be surprised at all if that 
guy went to prison for a sexual crime 

167
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:36,590
within the next couple of months.
That's not defamation.

168
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:40,670
Right.
The joke,

169
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,140
cause I could see some people start,
I could see some rumors starting to pile

170
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:48,950
up that Chris went to prison for a 
sexual crime.

171
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,400
Yeah.
Chris went to prison for a sexual crime.

172
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,260
Mila,
it's a joke.

173
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,310
He didn't,
but I wouldn't be surprised.

174
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,060
That's all I'm saying.
Do you think I'm insane?

175
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,073
Do you think that's my skill that I 
would get in a ring with you and fight 

176
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:03,930
you?
I mean he,

177
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,120
he's veins were like searching.

178
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,683
It's like what did you do to be 
imprisoned for the past two years to be 

179
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,500
that lucky?
He sees that as a compliment.

180
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,363
He's like,
he thinks I'm so jackie themselves in 

181
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,390
prison for two years.
Well at any rate,

182
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,224
Chris,
I would definitely like to play you for 

183
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:21,894
a quick game for a quick cast.
And I think that could be a special 

184
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:24,924
segment at meme royale in 2018 quick 
game for a quick kiss bonus edition or 

185
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,750
you're going to play a rock,
paper,

186
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:36,570
scissors.
Can you imagine kissing Chris?

187
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:40,170
His breath is probably so gross.
I bet you hear his tonsil stones.

188
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,843
I was just worried about the noise.
It's more than anything a host stay in 

189
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:47,734
with people just listening to me.
You can think that I'm gonna make that 

190
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,980
noise with Emmylou naive.
We should bring,

191
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:54,791
you know,
it would be funny,

192
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,610
you know how you have these a ringside 
models at boxing matches.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,170
If we brought one of these girls to do a
quick game for a quick Kessler then into

194
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:04,960
the mic,
that'd be fucking epic.

195
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:09,961
Ila seriously on down anyway,

196
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,650
so yes,
I am scared of you.

197
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,420
Good job.
Prank invasion.

198
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,390
You freaking ski.
You'd scare the hell out of me.

199
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,530
Now interestingly,
Joey Salads is on the phone.

200
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,810
Who was gone?
Who?

201
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,190
Joey has challenged prank invasion to a 
fight.

202
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,800
I think it's going to be a really good 
fight.

203
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,920
Did did brink frank invasion.
Acknowledged Jolie's yes.

204
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,370
Challenge.
It took some time.

205
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:40,520
It took some finagling,
but we have actually lined them up and I

206
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:42,980
think this is something that is going to
happen.

207
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,203
At first it was really hard to tell.
I had answered in response to this 

208
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,493
fight,
Joey sells my money's on salad all day 

209
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,540
and the thought of you getting Mommy 
Makeout Dade,

210
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,740
buy a salad head keeps you up at night.
And then he said,

211
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,970
you want me to put 100,000
on it?

212
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:01,310
I said,
apps a fucking Lulea put 100,000

213
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:02,930
on it.
It goes to the winner.

214
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,980
Winner takes all those guys are going to
be out for blood.

215
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,310
It's a morale 2018 where were you when 
the salads fell?

216
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,460
Now he's this good.
It would be a real fighting and like,

217
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:17,294
or like fake fighting.
What he was this wpf frank's fake 

218
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,740
fighting this,
I mean $100,000

219
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,820
on the line till the winter.

220
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,590
I'm not saying one is better than the 
other.

221
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,030
Like I mean I'm not faking shouldn't be 
on you want to fake it.

222
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,160
I just can't believe like people will 
actually hurt each other.

223
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,120
Well like Logan k assignment,
they're wearing gloves.

224
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,230
Yeah.
Well this is,

225
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,093
this is one again.
Joey Salads sent me this dm and I 

226
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:49,840
cleared it with everybody to get the 
permission to show this.

227
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,410
So Joe was trying to talk frank invasion
and to having fight.

228
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:54,244
And again,
this is why Brag of Asian scares the 

229
00:11:56,231 --> 00:12:01,030
hell out of me because this guy is so 
unhinged that I wouldn't be surprised if

230
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:03,910
he went to prison for a sexual crime 
within the next couple of months.

231
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,520
Joey said,
have you been training?

232
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,530
And I had a box.
So anyway,

233
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:09,640
he says,
are you going to do it?

234
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,560
Prank invasion says,
I'm thinking,

235
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,693
not boxing,
but nna no gloves cage to bare knuckle 

236
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:20,440
fight.
We sign waivers and the fight last until

237
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:24,010
someone gets knocked out.
Unconscious gives up or dies.

238
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,280
We'll need lawyers like this guy is,
I mean I can't tell if he's serious,

239
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:35,860
but that sounds like the worst of us 
have an absolute lunatic.

240
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:36,820
He said,
dude,

241
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,730
that's just too,
that's at least wear gloves.

242
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,910
I got joey's actually entertaining,
not entertaining.

243
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,000
Do you not watch the h three podcasts 
live correct.

244
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:50,440
Opinion zone for content just as this I 
asked who is entertained right now,

245
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,360
Joey Salads and preg vague and bare 
knuckle fight to the death.

246
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,670
Joey Salads,
first

247
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,360
prank invasion cage.
Fight to the death.

248
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,530
We need lawyers and wave

249
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,780
whoever thought we would get to this 
point.

250
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:14,720
But down all being said,
we've talked enough about it.

251
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:17,210
Let's see what the salad man has to say 
about this.

252
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,660
Joey Salads,
you are on the air and are you scared?

253
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:22,400
Like I am of Prank invasion.

254
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,000
I am.
I'm scared for his life.

255
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,393
He's going to have to sign a waiver 
before the spike in case I accidentally 

256
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:33,614
kill off.
You think that you've got what it takes 

257
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:39,740
to take out roided out prank invasion?
Yeah,

258
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,830
a little crazy.
You know more than a little crazy.

259
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:44,240
But how joey,

260
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,980
you seen his physique and his new 
videos,

261
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:47,814
he's clearly disappeared and he's been 
lifting weights and he's been getting a 

262
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,290
little crazy.
Have you seen this?

263
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,500
I have seen it.
It doesn't frighten you?

264
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,380
It newbie gains.
Okay.

265
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,350
We just started working at La Newbie 
gains and I'm joey,

266
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:04,570
you had mentioned to me,
uh,

267
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,140
something about him wanting to fly out 
and fight you.

268
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,440
Is this something that you guys are 
going to be doing off camera,

269
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,350
separate funds?
I don't think so.

270
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,950
It just sounds stupid.
Fight to the death.

271
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,410
I told them at least let's do the boxing
match first and then fight today.

272
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,640
Now what do you think now?
What's your take on preservation?

273
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,180
Joe?
Do you think he's being serious?

274
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:32,014
What has happened?
Because he's winning from Kissing 

275
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,090
Cutie's on the boardwalk to literally 
wanting to have a death match.

276
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,130
What has happened in the world of Prank 
invasion?

277
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:40,030
Joey,
can you tell us?

278
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,863
You know what,
I can't tell cause I was friends with 

279
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:46,040
him for like a week,
like two years ago.

280
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,340
I friends with him for a week and he 
seemed kind of normal.

281
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,060
But then he was telling me he uh,

282
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,020
he suffered from low testosterone.
So we needed a,

283
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,300
the bouncer on an enhancement.
But I think he just started taking those

284
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,670
and that might be making a move this 
down mine.

285
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,863
Cause I know some people,
they lose their minds when they started 

286
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:07,730
taking my performance enhancing stuff.
So,

287
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,653
so you're dealing with science possible.
They think he's learned this 

288
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:14,060
testosterone to levels that are 
unstable.

289
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,060
Yes.
That's what I believe.

290
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,933
That is fascinating.
Now are you going to be able to contend 

291
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,810
with that massive overload of male 
testosterone?

292
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:22,644
Joey,
are you going to have to come around 

293
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,610
with your own testosterone and Steroids 
Brown?

294
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,573
I've,
I've,

295
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,000
I've got,
I've got my own necessity.

296
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,990
Softer on that should be sufficient.

297
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,250
And um,
you had told me an anecdote about how he

298
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:35,084
has a secret technique that he did.
He beat up a bunch of dudes on camera 

299
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,760
reset.
He didn't want to show you the video.

300
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:43,370
Do you have my information on that?
And if you could stop washing dishes,

301
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,970
that would be good for the show.
You kept me on the live in 30 minutes.

302
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,990
I started cooking.
So now I gotta clean my daily.

303
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,590
You're alive when you're saying nick,
can you just,

304
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,280
can you hold off cooking a meal?
I mean,

305
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,450
Jesus,
come on man.

306
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:00,660
This is our moment here.
We,

307
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,503
we,
we,

308
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,680
we prepared for this.
What are you cooking guy?

309
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:05,570
What are you preparing?
Hopefully it's something.

310
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,453
I got it.
Okay.

311
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,710
Hard.
I got my protein.

312
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:09,544
Yes.
I'm already trained and I got like 

313
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,660
training and like an hour right now.
And he's doing meal prepping.

314
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,750
Yeah,
I got a hard boiled eggs.

315
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,390
I got a Turkey Patty,

316
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,740
sorry.
As much as I'd love to hear more.

317
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:24,540
I did ask,
but that's enough of that.

318
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,060
I've heard enough of your meal tech 
right now.

319
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:29,460
Tell me about this video.
That creek invasion.

320
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,533
He says there's a secret video of him 
beating up several people by himself 

321
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:35,821
now.
Joey,

322
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:36,960
tell me about this video.

323
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,093
I would give him $1,000
cash if you would send it to me cause I 

324
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:42,544
don't think it exists

325
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,590
cause you had asked him,
send me the video.

326
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:45,424
He said,
I don't want you to see my sacred 

327
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:48,280
technique.
He said that verbatim,

328
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,293
which made me think that it's kind of a 
kissing prank thing of like my secret 

329
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:53,284
technique.

330
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,940
Yeah,
so it kind of sounded like,

331
00:16:55,941 --> 00:17:00,680
I think maybe what he did was he tried 
to get into a fight with someone and try

332
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:02,360
and kissing them and,
and then just ran away.

333
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,940
Very interesting.
Third technique to do.

334
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,853
Is there any other closing words,
any words that you have for Prank 

335
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:12,274
invasion?
Anthony would like to say we'd like to 

336
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,374
cast the gauntlet.
Any accusations and slander about him 

337
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:21,020
being a sex criminal that's been in 
prison for the last one.

338
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,280
Would you like to add before we say 
goodbye and let you cook your meal there

339
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:25,450
that you're so eager to cook

340
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,673
is if he bails out,
I'm going to be pissed and you're going 

341
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:36,090
to be a bitch because he's been kind of 
flaky with this whole thing.

342
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,520
Trying to go from boxing to taste,
death,

343
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:40,560
nine sliding,
fighting.

344
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,120
He's a flaky guy.
I don't,

345
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,170
I can't tell if he's trolling or if he's
actually that weird.

346
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,800
So there's $100,000
on the line and I got to Chris.

347
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:50,460
Uh,

348
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,293
you know,
your channel has not been holding up 

349
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:57,170
strong lately.
Lots of citations.

350
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,880
Um,
and I think that $100,000

351
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:02,940
is a lot of money for any man.
No matter how many girls he's kissed.

352
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:05,970
Am I right joey?
Okay,

353
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,880
well,
I'm excited.

354
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:09,714
Everyone is on the edge of their seat.
This is what it's all about here at the 

355
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:13,470
HBCU podcast.
Joe,

356
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:16,050
we love you.
We love having you be part of the show.

357
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,740
You're don't forget to eat those salads.
I know that you're not a fan of salads,

358
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:21,480
but it's important to cover up.
Joey,

359
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,820
how do you get fiber when you're 
preparing for it to be,

360
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,880
to be in healthy shape?
Seeing that you don't eat salads at all?

361
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,990
Well,
how do you get your fiber,

362
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:28,824
Joey?

363
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,560
Joey,
I'm f.

364
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,020
Okay.
Yeah,

365
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,550
I'm not sure,
but I'm not sure.

366
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,610
I'm not sure that's a sufficient,
not one to talk,

367
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:44,100
but I am also not training for the 
century.

368
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,453
Um,
how many hours a day are you trying to 

369
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:52,560
joey?
Three for three.

370
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:53,640
Four hours a day.
Wow.

371
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,990
That's impressive.
That's very good.

372
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:55,824
That it was a lot.
Now are you afraid that prank vision 

373
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,313
being a little bit of a mad dude is,
might be go for a ear bite or something 

374
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:04,320
of that sort?
That's what I'm worried about.

375
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:05,154
I'm going to,
I'm going to tape my ears down the ears 

376
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:08,640
down.
I like that.

377
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:10,530
That's a good idea.
Better safe than sorry.

378
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:11,970
Right?
Well,

379
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,060
with $100,000,
you can buy yourself a new ear.

380
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,130
Joey,
we thank you.

381
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,890
We wish you all the best.
Keep training,

382
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,900
keeping that bread.
The fiber is important.

383
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:25,734
I recommend metamucil,
which is a great fiber supplement that 

384
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:28,824
was recommended to me by a friend has 
helped me out a lot and I wish you all 

385
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:31,980
the very best.
Joey,

386
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:34,570
thanks for giving us a ring.
Thanks.

387
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,290
All right Joe had God bless you and 
keep,

388
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,580
keep uh,
keep fighting.

389
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:39,690
All right,
you're the best.

390
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,180
Well there you have it,
Joey Salads in the flush.

391
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,190
Now just to summarize joey,
he's thinks he's going to win.

392
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,593
I think Joey's going to win.
He has accused prank agent of taking 

393
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:00,350
testosterone which has made him kind of,
I want to say a rage filled mania hasn't

394
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,253
resulted in and he is,
he has called out prank of Asian and 

395
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:10,650
said if you flake you're a bitch.
He said,

396
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,360
and I believe something else.

397
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,633
Something else.
We know that he's flagging cause we 

398
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:18,780
tried to do it then know your meme.
And he was like right,

399
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,060
I'm going to do it.
And then he never responded.

400
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,953
Well,
I think what we need to do next is 

401
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:24,024
basically draft a contract between these
two that locks them in a obligates and 

402
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:29,604
basically if he,
if brank invasion backs out of the 

403
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:35,430
contract,
what's going to happen is that I'm going

404
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:36,264
to be in contact with his probation 
officer and we're going to make sure 

405
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:39,984
that those sexual crimes he has 
committed or not going to be expunged 

406
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:46,590
and are going to remain on the sex 
offender website for a long,

407
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,670
long time.
Just a joke.

408
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,730
But we should,
we should get a contract with,

409
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:54,130
they'll go with the guys.
Yeah,

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,820
but the thing is even with the outbreak 
invasion,

411
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,663
we still have a great fight because 
shoon ice is going to tear someone's 

412
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:03,560
head off their body.
Um,

413
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,900
how are we doing on time?
I guess we got a little more time here.

414
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,190
Time.
We actually,

415
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:10,024
here's some great footage up next.
I got a lot to talk about before we 

416
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,080
throw it to commercial.
Let's watch Ted Cruz now.

417
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:19,900
Ted Cruz.
I don't know what the situation,

418
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:23,950
here's what he's in a church of all 
places playing hope and man,

419
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:24,880
Oh man,

420
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:32,070
can he throw a rock and by throw a rock,
I mean drops like a rock here.

421
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,610
Let's have a look.
No sound.

422
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:38,080
So here he is prep in.
He's about to take a run that's travel.

423
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:42,280
He's not dribbling and he tries to dunk 
it off a trampoline and boy does he just

424
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:43,280
follow up.
No,

425
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:50,010
I mean like a bag of dirt bag that we do
that again.

426
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,343
Yeah,
I hear you have ted Cruz taking a 

427
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:54,804
running jump at a trampoline to try to 
dunk the ball at a church down the 

428
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,120
center lane.
I don't know.

429
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,210
You call that a church.
The pupils,

430
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,320
the poeple's.
How do you,

431
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:06,690
what do you call those seats?
Pews?

432
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,573
The pews full.
I think they are just in prayer praying 

433
00:22:12,691 --> 00:22:13,524
for Ted Cruz to hit a slam dunk.
But the prayers were not answered and 

434
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,950
he's straight the hell it looks like the
devil literally stuck them down.

435
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,093
You're like the Fi's grabbing dropped 
basketball and a harder than gravity 

436
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,340
allow.
I love it.

437
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,300
So anyway,
shout out to Ted Cruz who,

438
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,980
yeah,
by all accounts is hated by all,

439
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,690
but nobody could ever say he's a bad 
basketball player.

440
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,870
Next up here on the podcast,
we've got three Therissa may the British

441
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,250
PM dancing.

442
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,063
Okay.

443
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,570
And my dude,
thank you.

444
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,723
Let me get with it folks.
I'm actually going to Africa and doing 

445
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:09,691
this.
What the heck is that white as shit I've

446
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,950
ever seen in my life.
See,

447
00:23:13,951 --> 00:23:14,830
I'm,
I'm conflicted.

448
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:17,110
On one hand,
I don't know if I can be like,

449
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:17,944
hey,
you know what you're making an effort 

450
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:20,530
to.

451
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,300
Yeah.
So like,

452
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,490
that's admirable,
right?

453
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,650
Yeah,
it is fun.

454
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,790
I think it is.
Okay.

455
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,723
I mean,
that is,

456
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,803
that's like,
you know what it reminds me of is that 

457
00:23:30,751 --> 00:23:34,290
episode of Seinfeld dancing.
It's that weird.

458
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,060
It's weirder.
I think he's with her hands.

459
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:41,610
She's like climbing and that hair,
it's like her body is broken.

460
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,770
She's like climbing at the air and man,
it's like,

461
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,590
it's bad.
But I guess,

462
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:49,370
yeah,

463
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,580
Alan Ball,
the cheese out there.

464
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,720
I don't know anything about her,
but it makes me think,

465
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:55,830
makes me like her.
She,

466
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,540
there's where you're like,
yeah,

467
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,373
cool.
Can I have a George Bush kind of thing 

468
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:00,380
where it's like,
you know,

469
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,600
as a person,

470
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,030
I don't,
I don't know anything about that either.

471
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,610
But here's more of her dancing.

472
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,990
He's getting in there

473
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,100
less western,
those hips.

474
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,730
She looks like she's hurting sheep or 
somebody who's like,

475
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,890
right.
There you go.

476
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,510
What is it when you watch someone dance 
that you have to like try to dance?

477
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,670
Remind me I'm ever in this situation.
Just smile and nod.

478
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,453
It's kind of a lose lose.
You can't be all right if you're just 

479
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:39,500
standing there,
you're like,

480
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,420
Hey Paul.
Yeah,

481
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,250
I,
you know what?

482
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:44,980
God bless her.
Right?

483
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,623
You crushed it.

484
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,550
That one's not nearly as good as the 
first one with the client.

485
00:24:50,551 --> 00:24:51,384
Get the air.
The climbing move was something I'd 

486
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:56,610
never seen before.
I was a freshman.

487
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,770
Um,
anyway,

488
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,050
off to good start.
Are we entertaining here?

489
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:06,630
What?
Boy?

490
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,770
So I guess that's been about 30 minutes,
hasn't it?

491
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,990
So I'll throw it to a quick commercial 
break.

492
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:17,100
We got back Logan Paul verse case,
I copyrighted our highlight.

493
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:17,934
I'm going to rant about that bullshit.
We got Pewdie pie versus t series TV 

494
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:23,460
series about to pass Petey Pie and sub 
count.

495
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,510
Who the hell is t and how do they have 
so many views and subscribers?

496
00:25:27,511 --> 00:25:28,344
We're going to dig into that and so so,
so much more new pit bull video with a 

497
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:33,714
dancing frog.
You're not going to believe this is 

498
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:36,870
real.
It is guys,

499
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,850
you are watching the h three podcasts,
correct?

500
00:25:38,851 --> 00:25:39,684
Opinion zone do not go away because my 
dudes that would be wrong and here we 

501
00:25:44,431 --> 00:25:46,770
are right all the time.
Stay tuned.

502
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,383
Thank you.
Two 23 and me for sponsoring this 

503
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:58,910
episode 23 and me is a DNA testing 
service.

504
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:01,430
They can offer insights into your 
ancestry health,

505
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:02,264
wellness and traits 23 and me health 
plus ancestry services includes reports 

506
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,230
on how your DNA can influence your 
weight,

507
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:11,090
sleep quality,
caffeine intake,

508
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:15,770
sense of taste and whether you are 
likely to be lactose intolerant.

509
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,820
Now,
in my case,

510
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,400
I did do 23 me and I learned a lot about
myself.

511
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,473
Sadly,
it doesn't help fix the things that 

512
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:22,664
you've found wrong with yourself,
but it is interesting and the case of 

513
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:25,394
lactose intolerance.
I find that out every morning when I 

514
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,800
looked at the toilet that yes,
I am lactose intolerant,

515
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:33,050
but it is good to have the science to 
back it up.

516
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,110
Now it's easy to do.
You simply spit in a tube,

517
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:40,190
which is the sexiest thing you pretty 
pretty much doing the planet provided to

518
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:44,970
you and you're 23 and me kit mail it and
you mail your saliva,

519
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:45,804
which is a unique experience you're not 
gonna be able to do anywhere else and 

520
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,740
the sample get it.

521
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,840
They see the lab gets in,
they analyze it.

522
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:54,030
Now they,
there's a guy in the lab,

523
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,250
he just throws in his mouth and squashes
it around.

524
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,121
No,
I'm kidding.

525
00:26:57,121 --> 00:27:00,930
They've got advanced at machinery that 
the crunches,

526
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:01,764
the numbers there.
Now here's some things that you might 

527
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,920
find out that my intrigue you about 
yourself.

528
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,270
Bitter taste verse sweet and Salty.

529
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:10,104

which foods you like and they're going 

530
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:13,020
to tell you which one you are.
Sleep report.

531
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,420
Are you a deep sleeper or you a light 
sleeper?

532
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,020
Well,
they'll,

533
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,400
they'll,
they'll read your DNA.

534
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:19,860
They'll tell you all about it.
Pretty interesting stuff.

535
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,870
Oh,
that's why I never sleep.

536
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,580
I thought it was because I'm just 
neurotic and uh,

537
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,580
nope.
Not My fault.

538
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,080
There you go.
Feel better already.

539

your weight might affected by saturated

542
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,410
There you go.
Don't feel bad anymore.

543
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:38,400
Yeah,
I'm a fat cow.

544
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,420
Oh,
it's in my DNA.

545
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,860
Can't do anything about it.
Sorry,

546
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,521

It gave you,
I'm telling you this is,

550
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,493
there's a lot of interesting stuff in 
here that you're going to learn about 

551
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:51,540
yourself and the world around you.
Okay?

552
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,563
Uh,
here's what you need to do to get 

553
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:58,860
started and spit in a cup a tube.

559
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:18,780
in those jeans because,
uh,

560
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,890
there's much more than meets the eye.
The genes.

561
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,490
Did you look in your genes?
I don't know.

562
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,180
What else is there to say about quip 
electric toothbrush.

563
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,043
Okay.
It's the greatest toothbrush on the 

564
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:36,360
planet earth and take it from a guy 
who's obsessed with oral hygiene.

565
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,610
It's got it all.
Let me recap for you,

566
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:43,670
and I've got something else to add.
The Brussel soft enough to not harm your

567
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:48,510
gums from enough to give your teeth a 
squeaky clean.

568
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,523
It's got it all it vibrates.
Do we have that will come to h two h 

569
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:55,350
three Acmr.
That's right.

570
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,950
It vibrates and it tells you when to 
switch sides.

571
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,250
It tells you when you're done brushing.
It's a three minute timer.

572
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,113
It make sure that you,
because your mom doesn't live with you 

573
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:06,930
anymore and you have to take care of 
yourself,

574
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,500
are done brushing your teeth.
Here's the part that blows me away.

575
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,810
There's always something new on the back
of it.

576
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:15,310
It's got this hard rubber stop.

577
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,090
You know what?
That's for Ila clean.

578
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:22,020
You're the gun that the tongue is a 
tongue scraper and it works brilliantly.

579
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:24,390
It's got it all in this tiny little 
tube.

580
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:26,550
You guys,
I cannot stress it enough.

581
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,040
Try it out.
You're gonna love it.

582
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,240

586
00:29:40,421 --> 00:29:44,680
brush of a caliber,
you're going to be dropping $200 on some

587
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:47,170
coal gate.
More like Watergate,

588
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:48,910
cause it's such a scam when you buy a 
colgate.

589
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:50,450
Am I right Ila?
Yeah.

590
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,520

598
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,510

599
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,650
Thank you.
To seek gig.

600
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,783
Okay?
If you're looking to go to a live show 

601
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,110
and event,
a sporting event,

602
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,030
whatever it is,
that it's got tickets,

603
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,630
they've got you covered.
Now let me tell you about seeking,

604
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,690
okay?
You get a view from the seat.

605
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,940
Whoa,
right off the bat,

606
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,910
superior to the other ones.
Oh my God.

607
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:52,240
Am I sitting in front of a giant pole?
I can't see anything.

608
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:53,560
No.
You see the seat,

609
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,423
you know exactly what you get.
They rate it on a scale of one to 10 

610
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,810
green is good,
red is bad,

611
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:02,860
so you know if you're getting a good 
deal or not right out the gate.

612
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,750
Boom.
It's simple as that.

613
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,640
They know what they're doing.
Okay?

614
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,320
Now I've established that it's a great 
platform for buying tickets.

615
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,830
Seek Geek,

642
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:41,620

Oh,

644
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,630
[inaudible] Joe,

645
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,553
You have a fantastic,
even better now I'm talking to my 

646
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,760
favorite couple on youtube.
Oh,

647
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,660
thank you joe.
You're too kind too kind.

648
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,910
Do you know?
Nice.

649
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,940
I get ready to win a Samsung Galaxy as 
by blah.

650
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,553
Okay.

651
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,980
Oh hell yeah.
Let's do that.

652
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,640
Alright.
I,

653
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,483
you've met Shu and I said before,
tell me about that interaction if you 

654
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,693
yeah,

655
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,580
so,
uh,

656
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,320
it was 2011,
uh,

657
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:23,340
I was a freshman at State University of 
New York at Albany,

658
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,980
uh,
and Mr Shoe.

659
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:27,330
Nice.
Kind of hijack a,

660
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,173
the cancellation of one of the biggest 
student events by changing himself to a 

661
00:33:31,951 --> 00:33:34,260
fountain in the middle of our campus.
Uh,

662
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,140
he wear diapers to go to the bathroom 
and he didn't eat for,

663
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,483
oh,
it was probably at least four or five 

664
00:33:39,271 --> 00:33:40,060
days.

665
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,160
Now.
Can you tell me why?

666
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,193
Wow.

667
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,880
So the biggest party of the year at that
school is a,

668
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,890
it was fountain day when they were 
turned on the fountain in the spring.

669
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,890
Everybody would go in and it's a good 
giant pool party.

670
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,530
But for Saint Patrick's day,
there's another,

671
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,753
uh,
unsanctioned event called the kegs in 

672
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:01,400
eggs,
uh,

673
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,323
which is just basically everybody wakes 
up at eight o'clock in the morning and 

674
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,440
starts drinking.
Uh,

675
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:10,550
so long story short,
a few police cars were flipped over.

676
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,770
People were on top of cars playing 
bagpipes,

677
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,260
real shit show.
Um,

678
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:19,150
so they ended up actually canceling the 
Fountain Day Event and Shoe Nights,

679
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,290
uh,
who claim to be a student,

680
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,230
uh,
tandem stuff to the fountain.

681
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,040
And nobody really at that time kind of 
knew who he was.

682
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,170
I don't even know if he had the 
following.

683
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,610
Now I'm going to be had the following 
now,

684
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,444
but

685
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,110
I am slightly confused.
His,

686
00:34:34,111 --> 00:34:37,410
he protesting the event or the 
cancellation of the event,

687
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
the cancellation of the event,
he,

688
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:44,060
uh,
he claimed to be a student would shove

689
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,433
with a little bit interesting because 
you can sell you the most of the 

690
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:48,044
students.
So you said he changed himself and he 

691
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:53,600
shit himself in a diaper and fasted for 
four to five days.

692
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,210
What did he achieve a success in his 
hunger strike?

693
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,000
No,
I think he was actually forcibly removed

694
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:01,220
it.

695
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,660
Oh,
probably,

696
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,450
but we did not have mountain day that 
year.

697
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,270
Uh,
he tried,

698
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,104
but did you leave?
Did you have the opportunity to meet 

699
00:35:08,221 --> 00:35:10,320
this great man and talk with them and 
say,

700
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:12,130
shoe,
tell me about what you're doing.

701
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,770
Can I smell it?
Your diaper.

702
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,643
Okay.

703
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,820
Nobody really knew that he was the guy.
He didn't tampons on Youtube.

704
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,930
Some warrior,
you know,

705
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,480
fighting for the little did they know 
that just came up there.

706
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,720
He was chained up there in his giant 
gear.

707
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,213
Just,
you know,

708
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,653
screaming at anybody who walked by.
He got all the local press to pay 

709
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:35,780
attention to them.

710
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,220
Um,
that's

711
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,380
visited him once or twice.
That story

712
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,380
definitely lines up with the shoe.
Nice.

713
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:44,600
We all know and love.
No problem.

714
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,130
Stretching my imagination to believe.
Yeah.

715
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,240
Joe,
we've got you here.

716
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,250
We are ready to go

717
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,083
play.
Let's just get right the F intuit and 

718
00:35:54,911 --> 00:35:57,900
start with the first question.
So Lube up,

719
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,450
get ready.
Shotgun.

720
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,540
A bottle of alcohol.
Let's start with question one.

721
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,670
Joe Is the weirdest thing shooting and 
ice has eaten.

722
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,900
Is it a,
a bottle of k,

723
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:19,820
y Jelly,
anal.

724
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:23,510
Lou Anal,
not normal.

725
00:36:23,511 --> 00:36:25,520
Vaginal.
There is a distinction.

726
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:30,521
I want you to be aware of being tampon 
soaked and hot sauce joe or see a bar of

727
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,960
deodorant.
The choice is yours,

728
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,093
Joe.

729
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,980
Oh Shit.
The weirdest.

730
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,910
That's objective.

731
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:45,020
That is hit and his opinion,
this is in his

732
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,983
opinion.

733
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,100
Well you,
your job is not to seek truth.

734
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:51,420
Joe.
I remind you,

735
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:54,330
it is to get into the mind of the shoe 
himself.

736
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,720
That what size is that shoe and does 
your head fit into it?

737
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,760
That's the strip.
We are running out of time.

738
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:01,140
You have 20 seconds.
Joe.

739
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,320
I pumped and Pantheon was blood,
but I'm going to say the deodorant.

740
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,230
See the weirdest thing shooting ice has 
ever eaten.

741
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,750
See Deodorant.

742
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,513
This is really anticlimactic,
but I don't have the folder open with 

743
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:24,440
that answers.
Just uh,

744
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,190
just everyone chilled back.

745
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,890
I ever ate was probably a tube of k.
Why Jelly?

746
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,840
Anal lubricant close first with three 
tampons dipped in a hot dog.

747
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,243
Joe,
I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed 

748
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:50,251
that a bar of deodorant sat next to anal
lube and a tampon soaked in hot sauce.

749
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,480
They found the deodorant feed the least 
bizarre or the most bizarre,

750
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,323
the three of those.
But that just shows what a decent kind 

751
00:37:56,961 --> 00:38:00,220
hearted a man you are.
Now I remind you,

752
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,340
the objective is to get into the shoe 
itself.

753
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,120
So going forward,
we got more questions.

754
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:09,670
You know,
we've got to get into the shoe,

755
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,653
Joey with us.

756
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,280
Alright.
I gotta get more depraved.

757
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,233
Let's do it.

758
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,580
Yeah,
you've got to get into this shoe.

759
00:38:15,581 --> 00:38:17,140
So here we go.
Question number two.

760
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,300
That's fine.
We've got plenty more to go.

761
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,600
What did she nice tell ilow that 
prompted her to tweet this.

762
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,890
Isla said to him,
slam some more toilet paper to clean the

763
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:36,891
shit that's becoming out of your mouth.
What provoked this from Ula?

764
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,390
A shoot.
And I told her her clothing line sucks.

765
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:48,220
B,
he called her and Israeli whore or see,

766
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,300
he said he wanted to eat our dog 
shredder.

767
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,290
Joe,
enter the shoe.

768
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:00,360
That's the one I know he called you the 
Israeli horror and I'm so sorry.

769
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,463
That's horrible.

770
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,710
And you're sweet.
You're a sweet,

771
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:04,521
sweet man.
Joe,

772
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:05,930
we appreciate the,
uh,

773
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,020
the sympathy.
So let's go to the,

774
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:11,660
uh,
answer books itself.

775
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,823
Be called her and Israeli horror.
Gotta be a little more slick and prompt 

776
00:39:17,961 --> 00:39:18,890
these up Mara.
Time.

777
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,013
There we go.

778
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,870
This is real fucking this up.

779
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,823
Okay.
Well what happened is I was my drinking 

780
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:29,250
days,
I've been sober since last Christmas.

781
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,183
He by the enemy had talked down an email
and I was heading out to California and 

782
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:35,914
Nathan's like,
it would be great for us to get 

783
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:40,530
together.
And I emailed Ethan a few more times and

784
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:42,090
it came up,
you know,

785
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,430
he wouldn't reply to me and I was just 
like,

786
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:47,610
well can you let me know within the day?
And then I uh,

787
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,560
I was just on twitter and I'm a ball 
buster,

788
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,410
so I just,
you know,

789
00:39:52,411 --> 00:39:53,260
I said,
hey,

790
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:55,590
you left,
you know you're a Jewish whore.

791
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,701
And I mean,
no,

792
00:39:56,701 --> 00:39:58,800
I'm sorry,
you're an hour from Israel.

793
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,200
That's what I said.
If she was from Tennessee,

794
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,240
do would have been a horror from 
Tennessee.

795
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,320
But yeah,
I'm not,

796
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:07,380
I'm not ready.
I wanted to take that back so bad.

797
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,300
I mean,
I was literally,

798
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,970
I don't even remember typing it to be 
honest.

799
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,433
Wow.
Joe,

800
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,860
you are correct in this point,
but I actually,

801
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,910
I want to correct the record.

802
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,860
[inaudible] was shooting ice.
What happened,

803
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,710
I think was that

804
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,543
he wanted to come on the podcast and he 
had emailed me and it was like so 

805
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:23,240
tentative.
He was like,

806
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:24,620
Hey,
I'm coming through La.

807
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,173
Uh,
maybe I'll pop in and we can do a 

808
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:28,310
podcast or something.
And I was like,

809
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,001
I was like,
sure,

810
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:31,850
I'll let,
I'll let you know something like that.

811
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:37,070
Then he think about it or sometimes not.
And then he emailed me like 20 times and

812
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:38,810
weirded me out and I was like,
oh,

813
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,400
fucking shoe.
And Isis were crazy.

814
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,480
I didn't get lucky,
dude.

815
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,040
I hadn't yet learned to harness that 
power.

816
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,570
It scared me,
but I did.

817
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:53,480
I needed to learn to harness the power 
of his star as Thor's hammer does.

818
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,160
Um,
so then he just went railing on us one,

819
00:40:58,161 --> 00:40:59,540
nine twitter.
That being said,

820
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,590
Joe,
you were correct.

821
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,390
You are on the board.

822
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,110
The one,
we're all very excited.

823
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,890
How are you feeling?
You feeling good?

824
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,100
Feeling confident?
Oh hell yeah.

825
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,283
We'll do it.

826
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:14,940
Samsung Galaxy s nine plus with a retail
valuable $1,000

827
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,560
terrific phone and use it myself.
Pretty excited for you joe.

828
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,893
So here we go.
Let's stupid on to question number 

829
00:41:23,311 --> 00:41:27,570
three.
Now this one is a toughie.

830
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:34,340
How many youtube accounts does nice hat.

831
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,270
Now you may have seen in our previous 
episode of the Tuesday edition that shoe

832
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:45,260
and ice left so many comments on our 
video.

833
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:50,410
It was heights of and Sandy,
I've not known on Youtube until now.

834
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,250
So I asked you this,
Joe.

835
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,113
Is it a nine youtube accounts?
Is it be 29 youtube accounts or is it 

836
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,653
see Joseph 50 Youtube accounts?
Enter the mind of shoe and tell me what 

837
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:10,904
is your answer?

838
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,240
Go big or go home.
See.

839
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,693
Ooh,

840
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,400
wow.
Well Joe,

841
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:22,450
you are entering the mine of shoe and I 
like to see that you've,

842
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,180
what you've dropped all rationale or 
reason.

843
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,690
You have put your head in the shoe and 
Joe,

844
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,240
I love it.
Let's hear the answer.

845
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,910
That is a lot to coordinate.

846
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,950
I don't remember the thing.
That's hard.

847
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,840
You too.
Youtube accounts.

848
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:44,040
I think that gives you,
but they have all history.

849
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,560
They have subscribers,
videos on them.

850
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:47,394
They're really not goes to accounts.
They all have his literary and 

851
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:54,170
interaction.
I use them exactly how I got um,

852
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,173
Capcom and on Ethan's video I'll post 
the comment and then switch to another 

853
00:42:59,361 --> 00:43:00,194
county and it'll just list them.
So well I'm doing is just taking switch 

854
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:06,090
accounts,
another channel bouncing in,

855
00:43:06,091 --> 00:43:07,290
liking,
commenting.

856
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:09,600
But it sounds crazy,
but yeah,

857
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:10,434
that's all me.

858
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,900
It does sound crazy.
Well,

859
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,780
you're right about that and joe,
you are right.

860
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,970
That's totally fucking bonkers.

861
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:21,770
The chant that much free time.
The Youtube accounts study switches.

862
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,220
Wow.
She Nice.

863
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,110
I'm telling you,
this guy is a legend.

864
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,650
I think he is going to be the first 
official member of the goof troop.

865
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,080
The goof game.
The goof game.

866
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,760
What do we like?
Goof troop or goof gang.

867
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,040
Goof gang is more of an alliteration.
Joe,

868
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,570
what do you think?
Yeah,

869
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:45,070
do squad goon squad a partial to Gath 
gath pack.

870
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,110
I mean,
why can't it be all of those names?

871
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,660
Well we've got a brand,
you know,

872
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,570
we've got a brand at appropriately.
You got to leave it up to the people.

873
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,560
Yeah.
Oh Damn.

874
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:58,040
Let's do a poll right now as we speak.
We have the power,

875
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:01,040
we've got twitter.
So we've got goof gang,

876
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,250
we've got goof troop,
goof troop.

877
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,200
That's kind of,
I like goof troop and then what we'll do

878
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,283
squat.
You what had you suggested a a young 

879
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:11,144
Joseph.

880
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,453
Good squad.
But now I'm like in years a little 

881
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,490
better.
Well let's add it but it shouldn't,

882
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:17,630
I couldn't pollute the full,

883
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,783
let's add it for the sake of historical 
preservation preserving Aaron's 

884
00:44:22,301 --> 00:44:23,370
definitely.
And uh,

885
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,630
then I don't want to,
did you have one you wanted to add?

886
00:44:25,631 --> 00:44:28,810
Anyone else?
I said Gaf pack back or I'll throw it up

887
00:44:28,811 --> 00:44:32,010
there but the throw that poll up there,
Dan and

888
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,490
keep us updated.
Um,

889
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,363
that's on our twitter by the way at h 
three podcasts if you guys want to 

890
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,274
participate.
But I have a feeling that shoe nice 

891
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,123
himself is going to be like a true like 
founding medic member of this 

892
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,870
organization because he's special.
If you'd be Asian beetle juice.

893
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,220
He is.
He's my beetle juice.

894
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,690
I can't really think so.
Like,

895
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,130
like I,
I,

896
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,010
I love him.
I think he's got so much potential,

897
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:56,791
you know,
Super Nice.

898
00:44:56,791 --> 00:45:00,750
Doesn't Evander's 10 how's,
how surreal this whole experiences,

899
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:05,090
cause we used to watch this video.
It's like deodorant,

900
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,130
bars all my life.
Actually.

901
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:09,540
I had some videos.
I want it to watch.

902
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,060
You want to watch some videos.
Joe A,

903
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:11,983
you're on the scoreboard.
You're two to one maybe would help you 

904
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:19,881
to enter the mind of shoe.
I want to show you guys a video.

905
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,710
Um,
and some are march.

906
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:27,710
This is actually from his New v because 
he started so many channels.

907
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,163
He's such a Weirdo.
He erases all the footage on his old 

908
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:36,270
videos all the time.
And then he makes a channel called Schuh

909
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:39,540
nice deleted videos.
So erases it on one channel.

910
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,570
We're,
he uploads it on another and it's just,

911
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,150
I don't,
he's just on another level.

912
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,930
So He's into asm.
I don't know what sparked,

913
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:54,240
do nice of all people again to Asmr.
But he has this character,

914
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,760
Marge Simpson Asm Mar.
And this video was just from um,

915
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:00,563
oh it's from the turn of the year.
I said the end of 2017 but here is a 

916
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,510
little glimpse of shoe and ice.
Marge Simpson,

917
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,030
a smr,
and this is completely sincere.

918
00:46:09,031 --> 00:46:13,800
This is not some kind of a bizarre,
surreal humor.

919
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,230
This issue,
and I was doing March Simpson,

920
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,073
Asmr.

921
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,020
Hey everyone.
Shoot ice asm are,

922
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,770
he's whispering.
That's why it's so quiet.

923
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:23,693
I didn't realize how many people were 
affected physically and emotionally by 

924
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:32,400
my asm are.
Hmm.

925
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,280
Either way,

926
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:44,230
he's basically just sounds the same.
You just have to turn the volume up.

927
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,311
Crack,
right.

928
00:46:45,311 --> 00:46:46,390
That's what smr is.

929
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,373
Oh,
we need is the voice from shoe not been 

930
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:49,893
watching my ace in my own team.
One to 100 open that by the time I get 

931
00:46:54,671 --> 00:46:57,630
to honor,
he'll be asleep.

932
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:01,960
Either way,
we have the special asm.

933
00:47:01,961 --> 00:47:06,070
Our guest here today,
she would like to say the alphabet and a

934
00:47:06,071 --> 00:47:08,530
few words.
Ladies and gentlemen,

935
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,390
Marge Simpson.

936
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,350
Oh my God.
Do you see that mark just walked in

937
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:20,830
for anyone who's willing to try the 
alpha?

938
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,413
Nope.

939
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,143
Yeah.

940
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,283
Hey.

941
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,050
Oh my God.
Nige in waking up to this sound.

942
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,730
Imagine the middle of the night,
fall asleep.

943
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:40,731
Did this sounded not quite sure what's 
asm are about the uh,

944
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,980

945
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,420
Okay.

946
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:51,603

950
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,090
Absolutely not.

951
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,060
All right.
I hear you.

952
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,070
Uh,
that's being said.

953
00:48:07,071 --> 00:48:09,680
You are on the scoreboard to till one.
Joe,

954
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:10,514
we applaud you are excited for you.
We think you're great and we think of 

955
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:16,520
all the potential in the world.
Let's move it on to question four.

956
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:20,840
This is basically a few when this,
um,

957
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,773
you get it all.

958
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,493
This is it.

959
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,580
Well,
right now the last question,

960
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,810
the last question,
but if he wants this,

961
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:29,830
he gets the Dang phone.
Yeah.

962
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,660
So that being said,
Joe,

963
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:33,340
are you ready to play

964
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,200
Papa blocks?
Yes.

965
00:48:36,201 --> 00:48:36,800
So yeah.

966
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,730
Okay.
Here we go.

967
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:45,220
How many times or has shoe nice ever had
alcohol poisoning?

968
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,510
For those of you that know

969
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,270
no shoe,
nice,

970
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:53,103
famously takes a whole bottle of booze,
puts it upside down and no hands and 

971
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:01,650
drinks it straight down to throw in like
a second.

972
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:04,140
He's done it with handles.
Okay.

973
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,280
So has she denies ever had alcohol 
poisoning?

974
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:09,930
Joe?
That is the question at hand.

975
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,970
Hey,
never,

976
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,553
not once

977
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:20,590
b one time or c seven times.
Huh?

978
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,720
So tough one.
Joe,

979
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:27,554
what do you think?
What do,

980
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,730
what do you,
what are you feeling?

981
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:35,390
I wouldn't be never so good guys.
Keep it up.

982
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,613
I mean,
shooting ice is definitely the kind of 

983
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:41,300
guy that would never have ever had 
alcohol poisoning.

984
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,460
It's a great guest.
But is it correct?

985
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,421
Well,
Joe,

986
00:49:44,421 --> 00:49:45,380
let's find out.

987
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:48,970
Okay.

988
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:53,050
I passed out with the dabbles springs 
one 60 proof.

989
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:54,880
I wasn't dead.
I just go to bed.

990
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:59,110
But I happen to have friends over at the
time and they couldn't wake me up.

991
00:49:59,111 --> 00:50:02,390
So they brought me to the hospital.
I'm a veteran,

992
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,390
so my insurance is free.
I didn't care.

993
00:50:04,391 --> 00:50:06,580
But I woke up with a tube down my 
throat.

994
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:08,590
They're pumping my stomach and I was 
just like,

995
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:09,151
Whoa,
Whoa,

996
00:50:09,151 --> 00:50:10,630
whoa.
Are you going to kill my buzz?

997
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,253
Well,
Joe turns out it was one time and the 

998
00:50:15,331 --> 00:50:19,770
doctors killed his bus instead of 
killing him.

999
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,770
But uh,
you,

1000
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:24,630
you were wrong.
But that is fine,

1001
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,040
Joe,
because you're doing great.

1002
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,500
You're on the board.
It's two two.

1003
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,660
This is exciting.
This is good for us.

1004
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,510
I like the,
I have and the cliffhanger is terrific,

1005
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:34,423
but this one is,
I don't think he'll have any problem if 

1006
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:37,394
you're shooting ice fan.
So let's just pop right into the fifth 

1007
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:40,154
question.

1008
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,670
Joe.

00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,070

1012
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:00,500
differentiate does enough.
Do you get good?

1013
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,460
You catch me?
Uh,

1014
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:02,800
do you catch my drift on that?
Joe,

1015
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:03,290
do you have,
uh,

1016
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,290
do you,
did you understand the question?

1017
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:08,250
Could you repeat the answer

1018
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,100

thank you so much for listening this 
galaxy phone plus.

1054
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,720
Thank you guys.
Thank you so much.

1055
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:55,190
All right,
talk to you.

1056
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:57,710
Thank you.
So that was great.

1057
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,030
That was awesome.
Um,

1058
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:02,210
now there is one bonus question left.
Isla do you want to play?

1059
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,970
Yeah.
Do you have the answer?

1060
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:08,350
Yeah.
Well let's just play.

1061
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,243
Let's just play then.
The second question is what's the first 

1062
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:13,970
thing he ate on Youtube?
So here you guys go.

1063
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:15,983
My first dog was a roll of toilet paper.
Single ply double apply or fog up the 

1064
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:21,534
system.

1065
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,343
Yeah.
So we finally found someone that likes 

1066
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:26,190
single ply

1067
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,023
toilet paper.
So that's why they make it just for 

1068
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,530
shooting ice.
Well guys,

1069
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:33,720
that was another successful edition of 
know your meme.

1070
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:37,230
Congratulations to Gel and is getting 
Samsung Galaxy s nine plus.

1071
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,800
Yeah.
Um,

1072
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:40,950
what else we got to talk about,
man?

1073
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,400
I mean that's,
I don't mean,

1074
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:46,020
I mean that's the best shit.
Now we have a lot more to talk about.

1075
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,890
Um,
let's see what's next?

1076
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:51,960
Logan.
Paul.

1077
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,460
These fucking guys.
Okay.

1078
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:56,340
Logan Paul Verse Ksi,
the promoters,

1079
00:53:56,341 --> 00:54:00,000
whoever's involved in this shit is such 
dicks.

1080
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,240
Now we talked about this and we made a 
highlight of it,

1081
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:06,650
which was like 20 minutes long and

1082
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,393
okay.

1083
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,320
I barely,
she,

1084
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,153
I didn't even show footage because I 
knew that they are going to be dicks 

1085
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:14,240
about it.
Yeah.

1086
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,200
We don't even show him show.
It was one,

1087
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:19,080
two is compilation of Jake Paul getting 
punched in the face.

1088
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,390
And that was like,
what's your,

1089
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,233
by the way,
has intrinsic artistic value that that 

1090
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:30,144
is the legal language be real.
So for them to fucking block at 

1091
00:54:35,611 --> 00:54:39,510
worldwide,
you stupid ass holes.

1092
00:54:39,511 --> 00:54:41,300
And here's the best part.
I disputed.

1093
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:42,630
I'm like,
hey fuck boys.

1094
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:43,920
Hey,
Hey idiots,

1095
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,581
eh,
you know,

1096
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:45,450
release the claim

1097
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,203
and they can keep it down for 30 days.
Youtube gives them 30 days to just sit 

1098
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:56,970
on that and keep it down.
Like the video should go up.

1099
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,240
If I just viewed it,
the video should go back up.

1100
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,340
I mean that's just,
it's,

1101
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,820
it's crazy.
And they're such assholes too,

1102
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:08,910
by the way.
Ksi video is just down for 30 days.

1103
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,430
Remove.
Yeah.

1104
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,030
And then at 30 days then he'd be like,
Oh,

1105
00:55:12,031 --> 00:55:12,864
you're right.
Sorry.

1106
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,560
It's back up and nobody wants to watch 
it anymore.

1107
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,890
Yeah.
But like,

1108
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,350
you know,
Ksi and Logan Paul,

1109
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:19,771
okay.
Sorry.

1110
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:23,810
Specifically is a guy that reacts to 
videos all the time on it.

1111
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,330
Yeah.
No,

1112
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,163
I mean this is honestly just sad.
And I know this has been happening to a 

1113
00:55:29,071 --> 00:55:30,510
lot of people and it's just,
it's,

1114
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,520
and you know,
you know what really pisses me off about

1115
00:55:32,521 --> 00:55:33,354
it is like before the fight,
they feed on everybody's publicity and 

1116
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:40,410
everybody's talking about and before the
fight fair use.

1117
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,550
Oh Great.
Yeah.

1118
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,340
Talk about it all you want after the 
fight.

1119
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,360
Talk for 22 minutes and don't even 
fucking show the footage.

1120
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:53,260
And we're going to block a worldwide.
I swear to God there's a case for like a

1121
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:58,380
class action lawsuit because it's so 
abusive.

1122
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:00,250
I mean they haven't,
no,

1123
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:03,060
no exploited.
They have no right to remove it.

1124
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:04,920
It's just,
that's what I said.

1125
00:56:04,921 --> 00:56:05,754
I said don't.
I said you have absolutely no right to 

1126
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:08,543
block.
That's just how the tools work so they 

1127
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:11,540
can,
well,

1128
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:15,090
I think youtube needs to modify the 
systems that you dispute it.

1129
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,013
Okay.
Now the videos back up and now if you 

1130
00:56:18,481 --> 00:56:21,450
want to strike my video,
if you want to put your money where your

1131
00:56:21,451 --> 00:56:24,520
mouth is and make a legal claim,
then go right ahead.

1132
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,010
Okay.

1133
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,240
It's so frustrating,
man.

1134
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,150
And for me it's not,
it's not that big of a deal because it's

1135
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:33,340
just one highlight of a lot.
But like,

1136
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,170
yeah,
I mean it had 300,000

1137
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:39,730
views and like half a day,
but if that's your main content and they

1138
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:42,700
can just stomp on you like that,
it's just fucked up.

1139
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,430
I Dunno man.
Not Happy about that.

1140
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,353
That really pissed me off and they're 
intentionally just sit it going to sit 

1141
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:52,210
on it for 30 days because they want 
people to go buy the paper view.

1142
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,030
That's so stupid and it doesn't really 
make sense.

1143
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,760
No one is going to watch our highlight 
instead of that.

1144
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,520
Well there was no capitation.
Exactly.

1145
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,430
If anything is going to make people want
to go watch.

1146
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,020
Yeah.
That's the whole thing.

1147
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:05,854
And that I've never understood about 
most copyright copyright issues where 

1148
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:15,301
it's like almost every time except for 
pure re upload yeah.

1149
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:21,100
Is going to result in more traffic into 
your original product.

1150
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,253
It's just so pathetic.
So I want Ksi and Logan Paul both to 

1151
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:29,380
know and I'm sure both of them will 
easily be like,

1152
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:31,240
uh Oh,
that's just a,

1153
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,120
that's just our production company.
You know,

1154
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,790
if they do,
first of all bullshit.

1155
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,910
I'm not letting you get a pass on that.
Look at this shit.

1156
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,110
They,
they make it under this like Shell,

1157
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:49,090
the shell company at t h piracy.
There's no information,

1158
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,670
there's no accountability.
It's just this,

1159
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:52,863
I mean this is Ksi and Logan,
Paul and all these guys getting around 

1160
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:00,880
having to take responsibility for doing 
something shitty that they know is wrong

1161
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:03,520
on youtube.
A T h piracy.

1162
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:07,570
Give me a fucking break.
The real crime is,

1163
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,130
look at that film now.
So good.

1164
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,610
The world deserves that.
I agree.

1165
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,770
I love that thumbnail.
Good.

1166
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:15,401
Dan,
that was you,

1167
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:16,234
Dan.
By the way,

1168
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,660
your copyright dispute is currently 
being reviewed by the copyright owner.

1169
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:27,130
You'll receive response within 30 days.
How about three days?

1170
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,713
How about they have 24 hours and then 
the video goes back up and they can 

1171
00:58:31,151 --> 00:58:34,870
decide in 30 days.
Why are you on the Dick of abusers?

1172
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:38,980
Youtube like it's time to do this 
differently.

1173
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,800
They have been improving though.
Well,

1174
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:43,540
I think you had to have been less 
aggressive.

1175
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:46,240
Like we had this video on anything 
Daniella,

1176
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,163
where we react to this lady like dancing
to hip hop and it was apparently 

1177
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:53,890
attempted to be removed by Youtube,
said no.

1178
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,830
So they'll send you an email saying this
was,

1179
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:58,960
there was an attempt about,
we said,

1180
00:58:58,961 --> 00:58:59,794
no,
actually I have to give huge credit to 

1181
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,870
that department.
That used to never happen that,

1182
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,900
that's actually happened several times 
where we got an email being like,

1183
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,750
and the best part is they say who tried 
to take it down.

1184
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:15,010
It's for some reason when someone tries 
to take it down and they rejected,

1185
00:59:15,011 --> 00:59:16,540
I see their email,
their phone number,

1186
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:17,500
their name,
the channel.

1187
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,840
I get their social security number 
basically.

1188
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,980
No,
and they're like,

1189
00:59:21,981 --> 00:59:22,814
this idiot at this address tried to 
remove your video and we gave him the 

1190
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:29,150
middle finger.
But somehow when these assholes do it,

1191
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,740
it's a total fucking shot in the dark.
You know it's not,

1192
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,693
it's just,
I honestly want to blame these guys 

1193
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:39,920
because they know what they're doing and
whoever put this together,

1194
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:41,590
no day there.
You tubers,

1195
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,443
Dane know how it works.
They're willfully abusing the systems 

1196
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:46,184
that youtube has put in place that 
generally work pretty well most of the 

1197
00:59:48,891 --> 00:59:51,790
time and it's just,
it's so late.

1198
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,680
Especially Ksi because he does react to 
videos.

1199
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,930
He relies on other people's content.

1200
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:58,570
Yeah,

1201
00:59:58,570 --> 00:59:59,403
the Paul brothers,
you can't expect anything from them 

1202
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,860
ever.
Nope.

1203
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:03,853
You guys know the law better than most 
because of the lawsuit that you went 

1204
01:00:06,651 --> 01:00:09,380
through and everything.
The whole 30 day thing,

1205
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:13,550
is that youtube policy or is that the,
is that the actual legal law,

1206
01:00:13,551 --> 01:00:15,170
like the DMC a thing?
Oh,

1207
01:00:15,171 --> 01:00:16,004
that's just youtube.

1208
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:16,720
Yeah.
I'm,

1209
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,553
I'm 99% sure.
That's just completely unrelated to the 

1210
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,313
law week.
I mean youtube put their policies in 

1211
01:00:24,431 --> 01:00:25,264
place originally.
Basically they were faced with a huge 

1212
01:00:29,051 --> 01:00:34,051
decision when they were in their infancy
and people were pirating content all the

1213
01:00:34,961 --> 01:00:35,794
time and putting it on youtube.
And so they had an existential crisis 

1214
01:00:38,921 --> 01:00:39,754
where they needed to deal with this 
issue or get sued into oblivion and not 

1215
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:44,410
be a legitimate platform.

1216
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:48,010
Yeah.
And so they are very legitimate and they

1217
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,760
do have a pretty good suicide.
I'm like,

1218
01:00:49,761 --> 01:00:52,330
if you compare it to facebook,
there was no system at all.

1219
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,970
Yeah.
So Youtube is pretty good.

1220
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,833
It's just,
it's hard to deal with so many people 

1221
01:00:58,341 --> 01:01:00,970
and it was always going to be someone 
who will abuse it.

1222
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,520
It is,
I mean,

1223
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:03,354
this video in particular,
it's just so frustrating because I 

1224
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:08,940
didn't even show the footage.
Yeah.

1225
01:01:08,941 --> 01:01:09,774
We were just talking.
I literally explicitly avoided showing 

1226
01:01:12,991 --> 01:01:15,000
the footage because I want it to avoid 
this.

1227
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,920
And now 30 days and I'm help,
I can do nothing.

1228
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:25,340
It's just so f up.
It's so whacked,

1229
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,560
Dude.
It's seriously so wack.

1230
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:29,450
So you know,
fuck these guys.

1231
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:31,263
I Dunno.

1232
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:34,920
Hey,
speaking of whack,

1233
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:38,400
got a 3000 responses on this Paul 
already.

1234
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,410
Oh yeah.
Give us the information.

1235
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:41,161
Well,
I got to tell you,

1236
01:01:41,161 --> 01:01:46,161
we are deadlocked at 33% each between 
two it goof troop,

1237
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:47,753
both 33% trailing a little behind his 
gaf pack at 27 and then port group 

1238
01:01:52,081 --> 01:01:52,770
squad.
Nobody.

1239
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,710
Nobody's on board with goon squad.
What are the,

1240
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,300
what are the top two again?
Can you uh,

1241
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,210
day and goof troop.
They are gang goof troop.

1242
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,610
I think.
I personally think the goof game because

1243
01:02:02,611 --> 01:02:03,444
of that generation.
It's just going to say that I would put 

1244
01:02:05,371 --> 01:02:07,890
for that one goof gang.
Let me vote right now.

1245
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,340
He has got to tip the scale.
Okay,

1246
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,350
that's interesting though.

1247
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:16,540
Anyway,
Pewdie Pie.

1248
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:19,800
Here's another one.
This one Pewdie Pie as everyone knows,

1249
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:20,634
has been the biggest subscribed channel 
on youtube for pretty much ever as far 

1250
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:25,044
as I can and common history and what 
he's up to like 65 million subscribers 

1251
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:30,114
now,
but out of nowhere comes this channel t 

1252
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:33,744
series.
They're out like 60 million subscribers 

1253
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,250
and their channel is going insane and 
I'm thinking,

1254
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,410
who,
who are these guys?

1255
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,693
What is t series?
And so that is what I'm here to answer 

1256
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:49,890
for all you guys today.
What is t series first,

1257
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,260
let's start by looking at their stats.
Okay,

1258
01:02:52,261 --> 01:02:55,740
let's pull up the social blades here for
TV series.

1259
01:02:55,741 --> 01:03:00,600
Now past 30 days,
2.1

1260
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,880
and a half billion

1261
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,260
views.
Yeah,

1262
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:09,380
I saw that number and I,
I was like,

1263
01:03:09,381 --> 01:03:10,760
wait,
there's too many numbers.

1264
01:03:10,761 --> 01:03:14,220
They call us too many digits.
Uh,

1265
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,530
in the past 30 days they've had 4.3
million subscribers,

1266
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:21,350
a plus bus.
The grade 4.3

1267
01:03:21,351 --> 01:03:24,260
million in the last 30 days.
Their parents would be proud.

1268
01:03:24,261 --> 01:03:26,060
I mean,
compare that with Cutie Pie.

1269
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,500
Let's see.
Damn,

1270
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:32,480
like Cutie Pie has 150 million views.
So it's a lot.

1271
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:34,560
He's about,
uh,

1272
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:35,781
I mean,
what did,

1273
01:03:35,781 --> 01:03:40,781
what did they have like 3 billion and 
not a comma and he's under a million.

1274
01:03:41,781 --> 01:03:44,030
So they're on a,
on subs per month,

1275
01:03:44,031 --> 01:03:49,031
which of course is nothing to scoff at,
but they are on track quickly.

1276
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:52,430
The past young Felix here and so fun 
ended.

1277
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:56,720
There's a grade,
there's a lot of double plus a plus.

1278
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,470
Oh yeah,
they're breaking the metrics here.

1279
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,040
So 2.1
billion views,

1280
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,350
that is just madness.
So,

1281
01:04:05,351 --> 01:04:06,184
okay,
who the hell are they and why are they 

1282
01:04:07,421 --> 01:04:10,990
getting so many fricking subscribers and
views t series?

1283
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,060
Well,
the answer should

1284
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,413
hm

1285
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,633
not surprise you.
I don't know what these big challenges 

1286
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:22,830
are always so weird.
It's just an,

1287
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:27,700
it's like Bollywood Shit.
It's just a bunch of Bollywood Shit.

1288
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:29,103
And you know,
I was looking at the population of 

1289
01:04:32,681 --> 01:04:35,920
India.
These motherfuckers have like 1.4

1290
01:04:35,921 --> 01:04:36,754
billion people in India is there about 
the past China as the most populous 

1291
01:04:40,601 --> 01:04:41,434
country.
So they are churning out youtube views 

1292
01:04:43,181 --> 01:04:48,181
and unprecedented numbers.
If I was Indian I'd be crushing it,

1293
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:54,400
getting 10 million views a day.
Um,

1294
01:04:54,401 --> 01:04:55,234
so anyway,
I curated some of their videos to show 

1295
01:04:57,041 --> 01:05:00,730
you guys what's going on with t series 
here.

1296
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:02,790
Let me show you first the channel.
Yeah,

1297
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:04,060
it was,
let's look at the channel.

1298
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:06,973
No,

1299
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:11,460
they upload a ungodly amount here.
10 hours,

1300
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:12,590
600,000
views,

1301
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,880
nine hours,
20,000.

1302
01:05:14,881 --> 01:05:17,800
So the variance is quite large.
You know,

1303
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,710
one day,
100,000

1304
01:05:20,711 --> 01:05:24,460
views and then you go down a little bit 
and you can see.

1305
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:30,160
So the views are pretty paltry.
But then here you see five days ago,

1306
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:32,170
20 million views.
Hmm,

1307
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,260
excuse me,
I'm allergic to views.

1308
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:41,470
And so then you keep going through here 
and you see this little nuggets like,

1309
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,690
oh six days ago,
11 million views.

1310
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,170
Yeah know one week ago,
10 million views.

1311
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,013
So these guys are just shitting out so 
much bollywood that it's giving my wood 

1312
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:54,573
Bali,
I'm getting a Bali hard on right now 

1313
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:59,170
looking at these numbers,
right.

1314
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:02,590
How is it possible the channel like,
like,

1315
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,680
cause if it's the,
if the views vary so much,

1316
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:07,150
why do people subscribe?
You know,

1317
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,233
usually those kind of channels of will 
not have subscribers because they just 

1318
01:06:11,981 --> 01:06:13,820
kind of like,
the truth is you let,

1319
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:14,740
and you're,
and you're right,

1320
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:17,140
it will be a viral video,
but mostly not.

1321
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:18,003
You know,
the truth is that is correct because if 

1322
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:21,184
you look at the ratio,
they have over 2 billion views a month 

1323
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:30,460
and they're getting 3 million 
subscribers.

1324
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:34,180
I think puty pies viewed a subscriber 
ratio is way higher,

1325
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,450
but he's getting like 20 or 30 less 
views per month,

1326
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,393
you know?
But there's the scope of uses and 

1327
01:06:42,181 --> 01:06:43,460
seeing,
it's like everybody in India,

1328
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:44,403
I've got the hard lined in t series,
so let's watch some of their greatest 

1329
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:49,624
hits.
It's curated India's finest Bollywood 

1330
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:53,374
here for you guys.
And let's see what these guys are up to 

1331
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:57,124
shelly

1332
01:06:58,430 --> 01:06:59,263
and what do we got here?

1333
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:04,260
Most popular video.
Uh,

1334
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,780
whoa.
Look at the view.

1335
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:08,720
Almost 600 million views.
How old are they?

1336
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,240
Do they just,
this is only a couple of months old are,

1337
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:12,590
well,
several months old.

1338
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:14,143
Let's have a look.

1339
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,320
Cause they're like,
they're viga.

1340
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,930
Is it there?
What?

1341
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:20,933
Vivo?

1342
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,140
It's like Indian Vivo.
That's right.

1343
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:25,993
Now this,
this Bollywood is the cornea shit on 

1344
01:07:28,851 --> 01:07:30,260
the,
on the history of the earth.

1345
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,050
I don't think anything has ever been 
produced corner than Bollywood.

1346
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,780
Here's a guy.
Uh,

1347
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,430
he's texting while driving and he almost
plows down,

1348
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:43,040
cut short.
The lives of two sweet,

1349
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,490
innocent young girls.
Do they react poorly and say,

1350
01:07:46,491 --> 01:07:47,330
hey,
I'm calling the police.

1351
01:07:47,331 --> 01:07:50,120
Fuck you know,
a seduction happens from this.

1352
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,350
Of course.
Okay.

1353
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:55,933
He's on his phone.
It's not lenny almost murders and cold 

1354
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,590
manslaughter.
He saw it.

1355
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:02,511
He's like,
Hey,

1356
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,430
what's up girl?
I almost fucking killed you.

1357
01:08:04,431 --> 01:08:07,410
Huh?
So anyway,

1358
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:08,480
Yada,
Yada Yada.

1359
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:11,020
Hollywood guys,
by the way,

1360
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:16,021
to or like the corniest mother dude in 
here anyway.

1361
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,260
Fuck at the end of the day,
you know how it goes.

1362
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,330
Um,
thought that was interesting.

1363
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:25,243
We've got more to come.
This was one of their most recent 

1364
01:08:28,081 --> 01:08:28,914
uploads,
which was quite violent if I can say 

1365
01:08:31,301 --> 01:08:32,450
that.
Um,

1366
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:37,480
see this is they're low viewed ones.
This one has 26,000

1367
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:42,220
views and it was just uploaded today 
actually incidentally today,

1368
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:45,760
I'm only four hours ago actually.
So who knows?

1369
01:08:45,761 --> 01:08:49,450
It could be their next big hit.
It's very violent and um,

1370
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:52,780
quite shocking to be frank.

1371
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,253
Not Noticing Bollywood action movies 
that these Bollywood Stars somehow 

1372
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:09,220
always looked like janitors or something
like this is the cause of action star.

1373
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:15,640
And I guess their,
their idea of masculinity is just,

1374
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,610
it's very different from our own,
it's interesting.

1375
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,033
A lot of Kung Fu movies,
the guys aren't necessarily like 

1376
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,513
handsome leading man.
Either they look back and this guy 

1377
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,100
doesn't look bad at,
at least in my opinion.

1378
01:09:27,101 --> 01:09:30,050
But Hey,
in India he might be king fucking dog.

1379
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:35,470
Uh,
I really don't know what's happening.

1380
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:36,843
So an execution,
there's really not much preload to this 

1381
01:09:41,321 --> 01:09:45,940
either.
Just lots of execution and bullet time.

1382
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:47,920
And now this janitor is about to kick 
ass

1383
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,833
Jesus.

1384
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:54,080
I see what you mean.
She's gotten like a bad vibe.

1385
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:54,943
I mean he like even if you put them in a
gooey and made them look as bad as 

1386
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:02,210
possible,
he would still just look like,

1387
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:05,160
you know the kiosk,
the guy,

1388
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:08,540
the Kiehl's.
So he grabbed it as a regular guy.

1389
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:12,930
Dick slammed him.
We've had the,

1390
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,570
the,
that hat,

1391
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:16,540
what kind of name that died.
Here are now daddy.

1392
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,413
Wait.
But at that hero and my opinion needs 

1393
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:20,803
like there needs to be something that 
back up the fact that he can kill 20 

1394
01:10:24,531 --> 01:10:27,740
guys with his bare hands because the 
Pudgy guy at the kiosk,

1395
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:32,480
I'm not necessarily believe in it.
She's got a big heart.

1396
01:10:32,481 --> 01:10:35,720
He's got a big heart and he sliced to do
it in half and suddenly and a hand right

1397
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:37,640
off,
man,

1398
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:41,330
this is violent.
So there you go.

1399
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,390
And I don't know what I mean,
this is just nonsense.

1400
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:49,420
It's crime.
Sorry.

1401
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:50,090
Beauty.
Fine.

1402
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:52,670
So this is actually really violent.
I'm not going to show it,

1403
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:53,723
but he just executes that guy.
Well I really don't know what I just 

1404
01:10:58,491 --> 01:11:02,750
watched the essence of Bollywood.
Yeah.

1405
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:03,823
Always because maybe those are clips 
from a movie and they like turn it into 

1406
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:09,360
a,
you know,

1407
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:13,350
an action set piece thing for youtube 
can it's bollywood year.

1408
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,380
Overthink things.
Not a bollywood.

1409
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,020
I got a sack and uh,
that's some good stuff.

1410
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:20,800
All right.

1411
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:23,630
No,
I listen.

1412
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:27,570
Well you got another video.
I am not trying to slam bollywood.

1413
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:27,980
Okay.

1414
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:31,300
Make 'em I'm goofing around,
you know,

1415
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:32,373
let me step back a minute.
It's just the Indian sense of culture 

1416
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:36,724
and entertainment and masculinity and 
femininity and all these things are so 

1417
01:11:39,191 --> 01:11:40,024
different.
It's just an interesting thing to be 

1418
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:44,020
hold and art.
All Indians,

1419
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,030
the goofiest people you've ever met in 
your life.

1420
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:46,690
No,
I'm kidding.

1421
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:47,523
That was a joke.
I was stepping back and then plowing 

1422
01:11:50,081 --> 01:11:51,170
forward.
Isla thought about it.

1423
01:11:51,171 --> 01:11:51,590
She's like,

1424
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:53,240
cause I was like,
Hey,

1425
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:54,483
no,
I was going to say they are actually 

1426
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,510
very nice.
The ones that I knew goofy though.

1427
01:11:59,310 --> 01:11:59,970
Okay.

1428
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:02,810
Maybe I'm kidding about it.
I don't actually think that,

1429
01:12:02,811 --> 01:12:04,860
come on.
This is the history,

1430
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,030
podcasts,
opinion zone,

1431
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:06,980
right?
You entered,

1432
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,553
everyone enters.
Not everyone leaves a what else we got 

1433
01:12:12,081 --> 01:12:16,760
here?
I guess that's about it.

1434
01:12:16,761 --> 01:12:18,710
You get the idea.
Here's another one.

1435
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:22,970
This one is 210 million views in less 
than one month.

1436
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,100
There you go.
They just,

1437
01:12:25,101 --> 01:12:29,470
they have so many hits.
I mean that here you go.

1438
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,220
More Dad's beating each other up.

1439
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:37,130
[inaudible] this is a real one of these.
We joking about it before the shell.

1440
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:43,420
What is it with all exotic like non 
European cultures.

1441
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:45,880
They all do.
What's this?

1442
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:49,600
They do it in Israel.
Isla you've fucking got a crazy one.

1443
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:56,220
DNA and Israel and Middle East.
Even in Greece they do this and uh,

1444
01:12:59,080 --> 01:12:59,771
Lebanon,
he,

1445
01:12:59,771 --> 01:13:04,300
Ron and now I'm seeing even in India 
we're doing this.

1446
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:08,650
Why can't white people get on this?
You just can't pull it off.

1447
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:13,270
Like everyone in the world's doing this.
You know what I mean?

1448
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,520
Ethan,
you're such a,

1449
01:13:17,521 --> 01:13:18,354
yeah,

1450
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:22,800
you're what?
What's the criticism of me right now?

1451
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,730
I Dunno.
Such a bigot.

1452
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,193
They get no criticism.
There's one opinion here and it's 

1453
01:13:31,721 --> 01:13:33,700
correct.
Begging Ethan.

1454
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:36,363
So closed minded.
Ethan is so disrespectful of other 

1455
01:13:38,861 --> 01:13:39,700
people's cultures.

1456
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:41,683
Yeah.
Well

1457
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:44,710
give me one of these.
Give me one of these in fucking,

1458
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:50,320
you know,
go subscribe to two series veer.

1459
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:51,163
So multicultural.
Why you go subscribe to t series with 

1460
01:13:53,261 --> 01:13:56,710
notifications on already did.
Anyway,

1461
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:01,510
I thought it was interesting if you guys
are glued to the TV about this rivalry.

1462
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:05,500
There is of course a live counter up to 
five earth years t series,

1463
01:14:05,501 --> 01:14:06,334
live stream,
live updates with music and everything 

1464
01:14:09,101 --> 01:14:12,370
you need to be entertained.
Let's take a look at the numbers.

1465
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:13,413
Wow.
We've got pewdie pie in the rise t 

1466
01:14:15,221 --> 01:14:18,370
series is catching up quick.
Oh I give them like a day.

1467
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:19,820
Yeah,
they're,

1468
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,020
they're going to creep up really fast.
So that's out there.

1469
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:25,030
If you really have nothing better to do 
with you.

1470
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,870
Ah,
what else?

1471
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:30,963
Hmm.

1472
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:33,983
Hit poll came out with a new video.
That is truly something I couldn't 

1473
01:14:40,521 --> 01:14:43,340
believe Israel.
This is why I showed up to work today.

1474
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:49,100
We've talked about pit bull here on the 
podcast with Jack and Eric and man,

1475
01:14:49,101 --> 01:14:51,530
this new one,
I couldn't believe.

1476
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,630
I can't believe what I'm seeing is this 
frog.

1477
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:57,260
Like I see the frog here.
So I guess it's a reoccurring meme.

1478
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:59,390
You see this healer?
This says 800 million views.

1479
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,930
Oh,
they want to got missing something.

1480
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:04,940
Let me watch this.
This says 800 million views.

1481
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,850
She has a dancing frog.
It's so weird.

1482
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,930
What the fuck?
Look at it.

1483
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:14,330
800 million views.
That's almost a billion views.

1484
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:19,740
That is not related to this song.
So yeah guys,

1485
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:26,950
this is 800 million views.
El Chapo ultra music.

1486
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:34,280
Could you do this possibly to this music
or the Latins on this?

1487
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,380
I don't think so.
They're more salsa.

1488
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:40,990
It's like a mixed with then submitted 
through any,

1489
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,270
this frog is on a ease on Mars cause I 
ain't ever damn,

1490
01:15:44,271 --> 01:15:47,930
this shit is so weird.
The 800 million people watch this.

1491
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:53,030
Who made this and why it's good shit.
This quality content.

1492
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,140
Oh,
why is the whole world so weird?

1493
01:15:56,141 --> 01:15:56,980
Like,
okay,

1494
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:58,443
Latin America now it's on my goofy list.
I wonder what is it in America that 

1495
01:16:03,821 --> 01:16:04,654
white people do that everyone else,
like those motherfuckers are weird 

1496
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,593
apparently.
Shit without a buddy day based off of 

1497
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,780
the responses we've gotten.
Really?

1498
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:13,793
Yeah.
I mean all the emails that I've been 

1499
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,100
seeing,
people wipe their ass,

1500
01:16:17,101 --> 01:16:20,790
hold their hand.
I think that's probably not totally

1501
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,700
Ian.
Look,

1502
01:16:23,701 --> 01:16:24,534
there's someone to look that up because 
I don't want to be that ignorant to get 

1503
01:16:26,221 --> 01:16:27,510
that wrong.
Well maybe some,

1504
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,670
I mean there's 1.3
billion people in India,

1505
01:16:29,671 --> 01:16:31,160
you know?
Hmm.

1506
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:35,310
Um,
well yeah,

1507
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:37,950
I know there was something that we're 
all fat probably.

1508
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:38,431
They're like,
well,

1509
01:16:38,431 --> 01:16:41,430
you're all fat and you don't talk about 
that all the time.

1510
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:43,350
It's,
yeah,

1511
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:44,370
that's pretty,
that's a big one.

1512
01:16:44,371 --> 01:16:45,204
That's kind of big.
Morbidly obese is pretty wild and it's 

1513
01:16:48,331 --> 01:16:49,164
just like being overly polite maybe.
But is that the same thing as 800 

1514
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:59,520
million people watching a dancing frog?
I'm not sure that's on the logo.

1515
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:01,320
Like,
here's this video.

1516
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:11,503
Get my needles,

1517
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:14,983
your boy dancing frog tape on.
Got The funniest face I've ever seen in 

1518
01:17:26,701 --> 01:17:28,230
my life.
Dude.

1519
01:17:28,231 --> 01:17:31,230
He just fucking the frog.
Just strip naked.

1520
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:35,970
Hell you guys.
It looks like the girls want to fuck the

1521
01:17:35,971 --> 01:17:37,050
frog.
If I'm being honest,

1522
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:44,070
there's,
there's not really irony here.

1523
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:44,943
Like they're serious about this frog.
Do you think flux better to the frog or 

1524
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:50,374
a pit bull?
I think they think it's funny and think 

1525
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,800
so.
They're not like that.

1526
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:57,060
Frog is bad ass.

1527
01:17:58,960 --> 01:17:59,770
Thanks.
So Isla,

1528
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:01,570
who would you rather fuck?
Pit Bull or the frog.

1529
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,413
I gotta go with the fraud.
I'm going to have pit bull feels about 

1530
01:18:09,161 --> 01:18:12,040
that.
Although you're not alone.

1531
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:13,810
All those girls seem to want to fuck 
frog.

1532
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:17,860
I'm being frank with you.
He's got crazy hip thrusts that frog.

1533
01:18:17,861 --> 01:18:18,880
He can really shake it.

1534
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:25,110
It looks like

1535
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:27,690
salad fingers.
I mean it's just not human.

1536
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:30,540
It's just not right now.
No

1537
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:38,320
frog.
Oh my God.

1538
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:47,120
Close your eyes and don't say a word.
All right.

1539
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:52,750
I'm seeing enough of that frog.
Whoa.

1540
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:58,090
I really wonder what white people do 
that words the rest of the world out.

1541
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:00,780
Yeah.

1542
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,640
Um,
what else?

1543
01:19:02,641 --> 01:19:03,474
We got this one.
It kind of feel like I'm being so 

1544
01:19:05,521 --> 01:19:10,521
ignorant this episode,
but I got a plow on it.

1545
01:19:11,301 --> 01:19:15,230
Doesn't get better from here guys.
We're ending the meaning of it down.

1546
01:19:15,231 --> 01:19:16,850
It took a seat.
What does it mean?

1547
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:20,390
Maybe you should read this.
Where,

1548
01:19:20,391 --> 01:19:22,370
where is it located?
Where are you reading it?

1549
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,960
And it is located on the Google.
I do help me out and I on all right.

1550
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,690
Dom,
add to Casita means,

1551
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:35,330
um,
casino,

1552
01:19:35,331 --> 01:19:36,650
right?
Sita.

1553
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:39,590
It means,
and it's got a picture of the frog den.

1554
01:19:39,591 --> 01:19:41,810
So I know I'm right.
It means,

1555
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:45,560
um,
stay still and be quiet.

1556
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:48,230
And this will all be over soon.
No,

1557
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:51,440
it kind of means give me your little 
thing.

1558
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:52,813
Whoa.
That's even weirder than what I said 

1559
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,593
though.
The literal translation of the word 

1560
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:57,980
Caseta is an innocent enough.
It means little thing.

1561
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:03,020
The course of this duty is dripping with
sexual innuendo and Latin America.

1562
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:06,890
Dom a Tuco Sita means give me your 
reproductive part.

1563
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:12,710
Whoa.
This frog is Grazie don to Casita.

1564
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,710
Holy Shit.

1565
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,700
Give me your little part.
Oh,

1566
01:20:20,701 --> 01:20:22,350
sorry.
Doesn't really translate.

1567
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,423
That's what they're saying.
They're saying in Latin America that 

1568
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:27,720
means give me a reproductive,
I think with like the implication,

1569
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,940
I think it makes like give it,
give it,

1570
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:31,590
give it to me babe.
Yeah.

1571
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:32,663
Yeah.
I think that frog has got more planned 

1572
01:20:35,151 --> 01:20:35,881
than,
you know,

1573
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:37,490
done.
Um,

1574
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:38,490
okay.
Let's move it on.

1575
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:42,810
You guys know about this test holiday.
She's a plus model.

1576
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:44,483
Now I want to handle this story as 
tactfully and our fleet as I can't 

1577
01:20:48,531 --> 01:20:49,364
because I feel like I have something I,
a legitimate thing that I want to 

1578
01:20:53,071 --> 01:20:54,480
express about this.
Okay.

1579
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:57,120
I don't know what that was and I don't 
want him to be,

1580
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:58,710
you know,
I want to handle this,

1581
01:20:58,711 --> 01:20:59,550
uh,
you know,

1582
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:00,620
politically here.
Okay.

1583
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:06,230
Now we've got tess holiday and she's 
featured on the cover of cosmopolitan.

1584
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:09,900
She's a plus size model.
Plainly,

1585
01:21:09,901 --> 01:21:14,901
you can see that it's extremely plain to
see [inaudible].

1586
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:18,463
And,
um,

1587
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:24,140
and so this whole thing about like,
you know,

1588
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,540
they're trying to normalize and say 
like,

1589
01:21:26,541 --> 01:21:27,374
Hey,
you don't have to be and shape or 

1590
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:31,753
supermodel right to be on the cover of 
cosmopolitan or to be an object of 

1591
01:21:36,201 --> 01:21:38,390
beauty and admiration.
Right.

1592
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:40,790
It's like a healthy at every size kind 
of thing.

1593
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:41,960
Yeah.
And,

1594
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,280
and when I saw this,
I was like,

1595
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:44,114
you know,
if you're going to criticize magazines 

1596
01:21:46,751 --> 01:21:51,751
for putting anorexic girls on the cover,
which promotes an unhealthy lifestyle,

1597
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,393
I don't see that this is any different.
When you put a morbidly obese person on 

1598
01:22:00,261 --> 01:22:05,261
a magazine and glorify it,
that's just as unhealthy as anorexia.

1599
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:07,783
I mean,
I'm not,

1600
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:08,953
I'm not saying she's not beautiful or 
that someone would not be attracted to 

1601
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:13,394
her,
but like I don't understand this 

1602
01:22:14,961 --> 01:22:15,794
argument of saying somebody is fit and 
attractive and work super hard on their 

1603
01:22:21,861 --> 01:22:22,970
health and their fitness.

1604
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:24,013
By the way,
I have so much respect for people that 

1605
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:29,023
actually maintain their physical body 
because rich or poor or wherever you 

1606
01:22:33,591 --> 01:22:36,410
are,
you have to put in the work.

1607
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,333
There's no shortcuts.
There's no work around whoever you are 

1608
01:22:41,031 --> 01:22:44,510
from the king to the peasant.
And if you want that body,

1609
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:45,523
it takes raw work and dedication.
Now this does not require that there's 

1610
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:53,870
no,
there's nothing in my mind,

1611
01:22:53,871 --> 01:22:56,330
commendable.
There's nothing and my,

1612
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:57,463
and I'm not,
and I'm not saying fuck her because 

1613
01:22:58,731 --> 01:23:00,530
she's fat.
That's not my point is,

1614
01:23:00,531 --> 01:23:03,860
but that we look at someone who is 
physically fit,

1615
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,793
that they have achieved something and 
that's why we admire them and we put 

1616
01:23:08,201 --> 01:23:13,201
them on magazines because everybody has 
the potential within them to carve their

1617
01:23:14,471 --> 01:23:18,040
body out of marble,
so to speak.

1618
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:20,380
You know,
to chisel away through hard work,

1619
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:23,560
that perfect body.
But this,

1620
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:25,930
there's no,
there's nothing admirable.

1621
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,910
I mean there's,
there's no,

1622
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:29,470
uh,
achievement.

1623
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:30,200
There's no

1624
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:35,200
hard work and sacrifice and it's just 
the conversation took a weird turn.

1625
01:23:36,381 --> 01:23:37,790
I can,
instead of saying you don't,

1626
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:41,720
you can feel eh,
confident,

1627
01:23:41,721 --> 01:23:42,470
you know,
you can,

1628
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:44,780
you don't have to feel horrible about 
yourself.

1629
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:47,180
Yeah.
And be apply size,

1630
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:52,010
but you don't need to glorify it.
I find it bizarre.

1631
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:57,090
I find it frankly bizarre to glorify.
I mean,

1632
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:02,560
a more morbid illness.
I mean,

1633
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:04,660
we sat here and talked with Boogie who 
was morbidly obese.

1634
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:05,923
I mean the guy is not,
there's nothing good about being 

1635
01:24:09,311 --> 01:24:10,144
morbidly obese.
And if you feel good and happy with 

1636
01:24:12,821 --> 01:24:14,500
yourself,
God bless.

1637
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:18,070
But like these are the same people.
They're saying,

1638
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,430
oh,
these anorexic models are not realistic.

1639
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:23,050
Yeah.
They're not realistic.

1640
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,780
They're models.
It takes a lot of hard work.

1641
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:26,793
The look that good physically to get a 
six pack and have a fucking crazy ass 

1642
01:24:33,071 --> 01:24:35,740
and thighs and be like fit beautiful 
person.

1643
01:24:35,741 --> 01:24:37,480
Right?
Yeah.

1644
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,990
It's not realistic.
It's really hard to do that.

1645
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:42,413
Hmm.

1646
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:44,640
So,
um,

1647
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:48,720
I think this is weird.
I think it's weird.

1648
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:51,030
I don't get it.
And by the way,

1649
01:24:51,031 --> 01:24:51,864
also I just want to point out to,
people always talk about like photoshop 

1650
01:24:54,751 --> 01:24:55,650
and like,
oh,

1651
01:24:55,651 --> 01:24:57,240
that's not realistic.
It's photoshop.

1652
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,433
She is photoshops all the way those 
thighs and her chest and her arms and 

1653
01:25:05,011 --> 01:25:08,280
everything.
Her face is so photoshop.

1654
01:25:08,281 --> 01:25:13,281
Then I have to tell you my hunch is that
that unedited video,

1655
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:15,420
that unedited photo,
you would look at it and be like,

1656
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:20,610
that lady's sick.
Not Disgusting.

1657
01:25:20,611 --> 01:25:24,060
But I mean like you see what Morbid 
obesity looks like.

1658
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:25,043
They've paint brushed it and brushed it 
and made it look beautiful and 

1659
01:25:27,361 --> 01:25:31,890
attractive and hey she's got soft skin 
and she looks good and she's got tattoos

1660
01:25:31,891 --> 01:25:34,290
and shit.
She has a little miss piggy on her form.

1661
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:37,140
Incidentally.
I didn't say that.

1662
01:25:37,141 --> 01:25:37,974
I mean it's right there Mr [inaudible].

1663
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,933
It's on her forearm.
The treatment of the photo is the same 

1664
01:25:41,641 --> 01:25:44,370
as the ones they're criticizing anyone 
cause she's still got makeup.

1665
01:25:44,371 --> 01:25:47,010
She's exactly,
it was photoshop.

1666
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:50,730
You can see exactly the shading and 
everything is on.

1667
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:53,130
It must have been touched,
you know,

1668
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:54,053
in Photoshop.

1669
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:57,790
And by the way,
I've met a lot of morbidly obese people.

1670
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,400
I'm a fat guy and obviously to that 
level.

1671
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:02,980
But boogie was saying like think 
morbidly obese.

1672
01:26:04,290 --> 01:26:05,123
It's a,
it is like an illness as I understand 

1673
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:07,544
it,
but like there's nothing happy about 

1674
01:26:10,401 --> 01:26:12,140
that.
[inaudible] I dunno.

1675
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:13,641
I Dunno.
I don't,

1676
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:15,890
I just don't,
I don't get it.

1677
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:16,933
I think as dangerous.
I think we as a society need to stop 

1678
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:21,373
being like,
I guess I just don't know what's the 

1679
01:26:23,601 --> 01:26:24,434
point.
I mean like I wear over the point where 

1680
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:29,024
we're like,
you're fat and shame on you and 

1681
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:32,983
whatever,
but like to put someone up who's sick 

1682
01:26:35,241 --> 01:26:37,940
and say look there,
to glorify it in the same way,

1683
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:40,220
it just seems hypocritical.
Yeah.

1684
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:45,830
This was a tough one to talk about.
Their hailing her as a brave.

1685
01:26:45,831 --> 01:26:47,030
I mean,
what's brave about,

1686
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,380
you know,
eating ice cream?

1687
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,130
Did I go too far?
I don't know.

1688
01:26:58,190 --> 01:26:59,690
Can I get one of these?
Uh,

1689
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:06,350
was waiting for a joke?
Yeah,

1690
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,393
I said nothing.
You know what does bother me though is 

1691
01:27:11,721 --> 01:27:13,730
on the other hand,
let's get our shit straight.

1692
01:27:13,731 --> 01:27:17,090
Okay.
Like we've got this shit on,

1693
01:27:17,091 --> 01:27:20,540
but the re I think the real damaging 
shit that's going in magazines right now

1694
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:23,420
is these Kim Kardashians.
Okay.

1695
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:28,160
With fake asses,
perform through dangerous procedures.

1696
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:32,660
See that is unobtainable.
So then you've got these glow,

1697
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:37,720
these poor girls who are working their 
ass off to try to obtain an ass like Kim

1698
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,550
Kardashians,
which is actually literally impossible.

1699
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:44,600
Now that is an unrealistic goal to set.
I mean here,

1700
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,280
let me,
let me show you these Kim Kardashians.

1701
01:27:46,281 --> 01:27:48,560
Before and after these,
these,

1702
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:50,570
these Kardashians are fucking twisted.
It,

1703
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:52,933
they've had so much surgery,
like there's nothing left of like who 

1704
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:57,404
they used to be and it is.
So I feel like it's so damaging for 

1705
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:05,300
actually for young women who are 
comparing themselves.

1706
01:28:05,301 --> 01:28:07,490
Look at this.
This is going to fucking crack you up.

1707
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:14,443
Look at this.

1708
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:18,490
Look at that ass before and after.
Yeah.

1709
01:28:19,610 --> 01:28:23,200
It's like she just excuse,
you've got to like whoopee cushions in r

1710
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:27,790
and so I gave him the picture on the 
right is not updated anymore.

1711
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:30,460
It's gotten bigger,
progressively bigger.

1712
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:39,320
I Dunno,
her ass has gotten so fricking big.

1713
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:43,690
Look at this one.
I mean,

1714
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:47,650
get the hell Outta here with this.
Which one do you want to say?

1715
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:49,893
Um,
just there's like a dress there in the 

1716
01:28:52,601 --> 01:28:53,490
middle.
Yes.

1717
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:56,993
Anyway,
that's all of them have these like 

1718
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,070
bodies that were created laboratories.
I mean,

1719
01:29:02,071 --> 01:29:03,690
if you want to talk about some of these 
unhealthy,

1720
01:29:03,691 --> 01:29:07,080
that's what's up now actually,
I have a story here about,

1721
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:08,740
and it's really sad.
Um,

1722
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,450
what are we going to say?
You do something bad?

1723
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:15,980
No,
this lady went to get a bum lift as they

1724
01:29:17,341 --> 01:29:18,660
call it,
a mother of three.

1725
01:29:18,661 --> 01:29:21,150
It was told by her partner,
she did not need surgery,

1726
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:24,030
but obsessed with these images of Kim 
Kardashians.

1727
01:29:24,031 --> 01:29:27,750
All these woman with fake acid,
which is one of the strangest phenomenon

1728
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:31,260
is I would say maybe that's what Indian 
people think is weird about white people

1729
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:32,610
and we'll get an ass surgeries.

1730
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:34,350
No,
everyone's doing it now.

1731
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:38,160
Thanks.
So [inaudible] um,

1732
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:40,500
and it's not only white,
but get a load of this.

1733
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,930
Uh,
Leah Cambridge,

1734
01:29:42,931 --> 01:29:43,764
a 29 year old beautician from Leeds in 
England is said to have died this week 

1735
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:52,260
after she underwent the increasingly 
popular cosmetic surgery at a clinic.

1736
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:54,690
Was it in Turkey or somewhere?
Yeah,

1737
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,700
the guy was apparently a world renowned 
surgeon.

1738
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:02,240
And what they do is they take the fat 
from your other parts of your body.

1739
01:30:04,351 --> 01:30:06,510
Yeah.
And they inject it into your ass.

1740
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,553
But the catch is that it's actually 
extremely dangerous because what 

1741
01:30:09,661 --> 01:30:10,494
happened in this case is that he 
injected the fat into one of her main 

1742
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:14,304
arteries that went through her ass,
and it went to our heart and our brain 

1743
01:30:16,621 --> 01:30:18,090
and she had a fucking stroke.

1744
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:19,413
Okay.

1745
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:22,750
Yeah.
So how about that for ridiculous,

1746
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:23,920
you know what I mean?
Like,

1747
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:24,783
I dunno.
I feel like we should be talking about 

1748
01:30:26,411 --> 01:30:29,290
this mental illness that's in our 
society.

1749
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:31,540
People are putting fat in their ass.

1750
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:33,730
Yeah.

1751
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:35,060
Um,
crazy shit.

1752
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:36,290
Good.
Yeah.

1753
01:30:36,291 --> 01:30:41,291
Even Cardi B has a story about how she 
did and in like a surgery at any illegal

1754
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:46,730
place just in some lady's basement.
I mean,

1755
01:30:46,731 --> 01:30:47,564
that's probably,
people can't afford to go to probably 

1756
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,500
the legitimate places,

1757
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,690
the procedure costs.
Um,

1758
01:30:56,710 --> 01:30:57,480
oh,
she,

1759
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,540
she definitely want cheap.

1760
01:30:58,970 --> 01:30:59,803
Okay.

1761
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:03,670
The procedure costs 6,500
pounds to 10,000

1762
01:31:03,671 --> 01:31:06,610
pounds in the UK,
but in the Turkey it costs 3000 pounds.

1763
01:31:06,611 --> 01:31:06,991
Well,
I didn't,

1764
01:31:06,991 --> 01:31:10,600
I was probably expensive and Turkey,
but like,

1765
01:31:10,601 --> 01:31:12,220
man,
God,

1766
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,040
that's so tragic.
Like Jesus Christ.

1767
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,070
I think we need to be talking about 
that.

1768
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:19,643
I think guys who talk more to their 
girlfriends and tell them they really 

1769
01:31:22,951 --> 01:31:23,784
don't need to do it well,
because I feel like it becomes like a 

1770
01:31:26,401 --> 01:31:27,234
competition.
But when women and they start to feel 

1771
01:31:29,371 --> 01:31:30,204
insecure next to that,
the article said the guy told her she 

1772
01:31:32,251 --> 01:31:32,930
didn't get it.
Like,

1773
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,740
well what could he do?
Yeah.

1774
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:35,713
I don't know.

1775
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:39,190
I don't know.
It's so bad I think.

1776
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:44,420
But it's like you open instagram and all
you see is like this crazy but like

1777
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:47,093
unrealistic actually unreal sick bodies.
We used to consider unrealistic bodies 

1778
01:31:50,731 --> 01:31:51,564
in this dialogue of like super fit,
hardworking people that achieved a god 

1779
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:56,724
like body.
Yeah.

1780
01:31:56,730 --> 01:31:57,563
Now we're talking about people that are 
injecting fat in their ass and then 

1781
01:32:00,851 --> 01:32:02,950
little girls have being like,
how do I get that ass?

1782
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,353
Oh,
I'm gonna go get fat injected in my 

1783
01:32:05,141 --> 01:32:06,790
heart and have a stroke.
Well,

1784
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:08,720
yeah,
it's really easy.

1785
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:12,980
It's really easy to feel insecure when 
you see all those acids.

1786
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:16,330
[inaudible] Graham is very dangerous.
I'm,

1787
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:17,263
I'm very,
I'm skinny and like Brady flat all 

1788
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:22,820
around.
And it's like when you look at those,

1789
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:26,320
all the instagram models these days,
it's crazy.

1790
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:29,000
It's like,
do you feel bad when you see that stuff?

1791
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:33,470
I'm pretty at peace with my body so I 
don't,

1792
01:32:33,530 --> 01:32:36,740
but I can see,
I can point in your life when you were,

1793
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:39,980
yeah,
there was when I was younger,

1794
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:45,260
but I think I've,
I've talked to our friends.

1795
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,480
Perfect.
Just leave.

1796
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:53,080
But I know and you're asked to flop.
You're asked is great.

1797
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:58,760
Everything's going on there.
It's a very regular too skinny person.

1798
01:32:58,761 --> 01:32:59,810
The dips,
a great one.

1799
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:04,280
One of the best.
But like,

1800
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:05,780
yeah,
I've talked to,

1801
01:33:05,781 --> 01:33:06,614
I do have friends and I know people feel
pretty insecure and a lot of people are 

1802
01:33:10,131 --> 01:33:10,964
doing the surgeries and a lot,
let's talk about not reach people to 

1803
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:16,340
ethical morning.
Let's talk about that.

1804
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:17,893
Yeah.
I don't know this whole thing about 

1805
01:33:19,371 --> 01:33:20,780
like,
I feel like,

1806
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:23,810
and it's the same in Israel,
so that's why I'm saying it's not,

1807
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:25,483
I don't think it's only here.
So that was a whole discussion about 

1808
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:30,804
body issues.
So I hope that there was something 

1809
01:33:32,191 --> 01:33:33,090
there.
Interesting for you.

1810
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:38,190
And if you're considering I'm injecting 
fat into your ass,

1811
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:39,780
don't do it.
Please.

1812
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,660
I frankly,
I on my part,

1813
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:45,960
when I see Kim Kardashians ass,
I'm like,

1814
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:46,973
you have a disease.
It looks like you have a tumor in your 

1815
01:33:49,981 --> 01:33:53,430
ass.
It just becomes like a,

1816
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,590
almost like a carrie could.
Sure.

1817
01:33:55,650 --> 01:33:58,050
It's looks,
it looks like,

1818
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:59,910
I mean to me it looks really bad.

1819
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:02,763
How did she,
when she shits it must be like a long 

1820
01:34:04,211 --> 01:34:05,044
way to the toilet.
It was that got a lot of space between 

1821
01:34:07,721 --> 01:34:08,554
the ass you cause it's so big she must 
have to like either she's spreads open 

1822
01:34:13,001 --> 01:34:13,834
the ass cheeks super wide or she's 
getting shit streaks on the inside of 

1823
01:34:17,081 --> 01:34:20,660
her cheek and did not think about that.
Think about it.

1824
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:25,040
Also these days you have to have like a 
10 inch Dick just to get inside of her.

1825
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:29,450
Wouldn't you love to discuss with her 
her wiping?

1826
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:33,140
You've got Kim condition on the line?
Yeah.

1827
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:35,570
I'm not sure that's a conversation she's
uh,

1828
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:36,780
she's ready to have.
No.

1829
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:39,733
But seriously,
like how do you even have sex with a 

1830
01:34:40,731 --> 01:34:44,000
girl that fat?
Like the barrier for entry is like eight

1831
01:34:44,001 --> 01:34:44,834
matrix plus it works like that.
I think the fat goes like sideways and 

1832
01:34:48,021 --> 01:34:51,750
more all up to the side.
I mean that doesn't sound sexy ladies.

1833
01:34:52,490 --> 01:34:56,480
Keep your ass natural.
Keep it all natural.

1834
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:58,610
Okay.
You're looking good,

1835
01:34:59,090 --> 01:35:02,030
you're beautiful.
And I guarantee you there's Min,

1836
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:02,990
every,
everywhere,

1837
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:04,770
every corner you turn that wants to fuck
you.

1838
01:35:04,771 --> 01:35:05,604
It just the way you are.
And most of them don't even have a tech 

1839
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:13,340
big enough to penetrate the ass on Kim 
Kardashians.

1840
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:17,520
Right.
You'll okay.

1841
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:19,290
All right.
What else?

1842
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:22,530
We got not pep talk.
Louis C.

1843
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:23,363
Case back.
Woo.

1844
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:27,150
I feel like I don't want to talk about 
this.

1845
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,193
Not because I,
I'll talk about briefly just in Somas 

1846
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,640
there's so much here,
but we see case back.

1847
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:36,660
Um,
he just popped in apparently.

1848
01:35:37,290 --> 01:35:38,123
You know,
it was funny cause we were talking with 

1849
01:35:38,881 --> 01:35:40,020
Bert like,
yeah,

1850
01:35:40,021 --> 01:35:42,990
before this happened and we were like,
um,

1851
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:43,933
Louie,
he was going to be back at his opening 

1852
01:35:46,831 --> 01:35:49,310
line is going to be like some genius 
line.

1853
01:35:49,311 --> 01:35:50,580
Yeah.
And everyone's gonna be like,

1854
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,200
oh,
he's a genius.

1855
01:35:52,201 --> 01:35:57,040
And he's back and we said like,
we don't know how long it's gonna take.

1856
01:35:57,041 --> 01:36:00,990
And like maybe two years,
couple of years,

1857
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:05,250
and then the next day.
You know what I got to say?

1858
01:36:05,251 --> 01:36:06,084
A lot of people were upset that he had 
the balls to come back and that he 

1859
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:11,790
hadn't been punished and that,
you know,

1860
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:14,760
Fuck Louis C K,
that's not my angle.

1861
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:18,090
I think he came back too soon.

1862
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:22,050
What I what I'm disappointed in as him 
as a comedian,

1863
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:27,250
you can't just come back on stage and do
material like a,

1864
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,330
nothing happened.
He didn't even address it.

1865
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:34,260
Like I did hear the material was funny.
Wow.

1866
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:36,120
Yeah.
I'm sure he is very funny.

1867
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:37,770
Yeah.
But it's like,

1868
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:39,630
dude,
you had the moment.

1869
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:42,420
The moment had to be perfect.
Yeah.

1870
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:43,343
He had to come out after a couple of 
years and when people almost forgot it 

1871
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:48,000
and be like,
so how about them dog years?

1872
01:36:48,001 --> 01:36:48,601
Huh?
Or whatever.

1873
01:36:48,601 --> 01:36:52,110
I know.
So it was way too soon.

1874
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:56,140
Just people need enough time to like,
yeah,

1875
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:58,830
it was too thin.
They just the news.

1876
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:01,950
But then someone had a good point.
Was it?

1877
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:03,450
I don't remember who brought it up.
Was it Dan?

1878
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:05,760
Uh,
can someone take shredder out?

1879
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:10,980
He's got your hurt.
Treader it's his birthday and all.

1880
01:37:10,981 --> 01:37:13,560
He's such a cutie pie cook them a 
flaming neon.

1881
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:14,643
Okay.
We said it was shredded birthday at the 

1882
01:37:15,721 --> 01:37:16,290
top,
right?

1883
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:17,123
Yeah.
We're going to cook them a Philemon 

1884
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:21,770
Yellen tonight.
I'm most excited for me to eat a flaming

1885
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:23,220
on.
Um,

1886
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,930
I just think,
oh,

1887
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,940
I forget who said this,
but they're like,

1888
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:34,660
he's probably so depressed and 
borderline,

1889
01:37:34,661 --> 01:37:37,600
even suicidal.
I don't know if that's true or not,

1890
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:38,800
but like,
yeah,

1891
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:40,840
that,
that was me saying that and yeah.

1892
01:37:40,841 --> 01:37:41,674
And you know,
it makes me wonder a lot of these 

1893
01:37:43,181 --> 01:37:45,430
comedians that you guys have even talked
to you on the show.

1894
01:37:45,431 --> 01:37:48,010
Just talk about how like therapeutic 
even for you,

1895
01:37:48,011 --> 01:37:48,611
Ethan,
you know,

1896
01:37:48,611 --> 01:37:51,490
when you come and do the podcast and 
everything and you know,

1897
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:52,480
Louie,
his life,

1898
01:37:52,481 --> 01:37:55,030
his stand up.
So yeah.

1899
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:56,270
Makes me wonder.
It's like I,

1900
01:37:56,271 --> 01:37:58,950
I agree that I think it's way too soon 
for him to come back,

1901
01:37:58,951 --> 01:38:03,060
but I almost wonder if he was just 
sitting at home alone and like,

1902
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:05,520
I gotta get out there and do this,
or I don't know what I'm going to do,

1903
01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:06,483
you know?

1904
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,150
Yeah.
I don't know.

1905
01:38:09,151 --> 01:38:09,984
His situation is a tough one.
It was just mostly weird to just not 

1906
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:15,090
even acknowledge.
Yeah,

1907
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:15,953
that's what I,
that's what I'm disappointed because I 

1908
01:38:18,451 --> 01:38:19,284
don't know,
there was so much pressure on that 

1909
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:21,990
opening line of like,
Oh shit,

1910
01:38:21,991 --> 01:38:22,824
Louise back.
I feel like he should have waited until 

1911
01:38:25,231 --> 01:38:28,140
everyone almost forgot it.
Even that me too was a thing like it was

1912
01:38:28,141 --> 01:38:29,970
settled.
You're like,

1913
01:38:29,971 --> 01:38:30,804
okay,
you too.

1914
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:32,773
You too.
And then wait another year and then 

1915
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:39,220
Louie,
his opening line would be something like

1916
01:38:39,221 --> 01:38:40,054
that.

1917
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:40,880
Yeah.

1918
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,340
Anyone want to see my deck right close 
to the north.

1919
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:48,740
Anyone in here want to see me 
masturbate.

1920
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:54,410
Right.
You own it to Saint Louis.

1921
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:58,400
That would have been a great opening 
line.

1922
01:38:58,401 --> 01:39:00,440
What did not have got out there and just
whipped it out.

1923
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:01,453
Yeah.
Don't even,

1924
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:03,403
he goes like this,
lock the doors and then he takes his 

1925
01:39:05,091 --> 01:39:08,570
dick out.
That would have killed.

1926
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:11,900
So anyway,
that's my 2 cents on that.

1927
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:13,940
Guys.
This is the correct opinion zone.

1928
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:16,340
You wash these Tuesday episodes for my 
opinion,

1929
01:39:16,370 --> 01:39:18,200
which are correct and relevant.
Every top,

1930
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:20,150
if you disagree,
keep watching.

1931
01:39:20,151 --> 01:39:22,550
I don't want to lose you as a viewer,
but just know that you are wrong.

1932
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:24,860
Um,

1933
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:32,280
the celeb hacker who hacked a Jennifer 
Lawrence and all the celebrities who got

1934
01:39:33,071 --> 01:39:34,720
all their nudies leaked out into the 
world,

1935
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:40,360
the fat burning as it were,
has pleaded guilty.

1936
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:41,253
Admitting that,
and here's what shocked me about this 

1937
01:39:43,631 --> 01:39:44,464
story.
He sent emails to the victims while 

1938
01:39:46,331 --> 01:39:47,164
posing as members of onlines,
apple's online security personnel in 

1939
01:39:50,441 --> 01:39:52,540
order to obtain their username and 
passwords.

1940
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:53,733
This,
this amazing hacker that got all these 

1941
01:39:55,721 --> 01:39:58,330
nudes.
He was just doing a phishing scam.

1942
01:39:59,080 --> 01:39:59,913
It's all it takes.
I thought this was some like slick 

1943
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,610
underground,
crazy hacker.

1944
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:04,493
Yeah.
He's just a guy who sent the email to 

1945
01:40:06,371 --> 01:40:07,660
Jennifer Lawrence and said,
hey,

1946
01:40:07,661 --> 01:40:08,494
please log into your apple account.
I almost feel like that is what happen 

1947
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,950
is like 90% of the time.
Yeah.

1948
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:21,250
Like how often did they actually have 
your password?

1949
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,440
Oh I thought it was some crazy thing 
cause he,

1950
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:28,620
he had like dozens of of celebrity nudes
and

1951
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:33,780
you know,
it was just a fricking phishing scam.

1952
01:40:33,781 --> 01:40:35,430
So there you go.
Get inspired you guys.

1953
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:36,803
I think this is an inspiring twist on 
this story to everyone out there who's 

1954
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:41,220
like,
I want to see Jennifer Lawrence nude.

1955
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,220
But I mean,
I'll know,

1956
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:44,730
you know I'm saying like,
I'm not saying that specifically,

1957
01:40:44,731 --> 01:40:49,410
but like anything is possible.
Sometimes you will go to jail.

1958
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:50,460
Yeah,
you will go to jail.

1959
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,570
Obviously there's consequences,
but that's not the more,

1960
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:53,463
the moral,
the story is not to steal people's 

1961
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:56,680
nudes,
but that anything is possible.

1962
01:40:56,950 --> 01:41:00,670
Did you think that you could see 
Jennifer Lawrence nude by simply sending

1963
01:41:00,671 --> 01:41:03,730
her a login credentials and saying,
Hey,

1964
01:41:03,731 --> 01:41:05,950
I'm from apple.
Can you log in now?

1965
01:41:05,951 --> 01:41:10,951
I'm not saying to do that,
but I'm just saying get inspired because

1966
01:41:11,021 --> 01:41:16,021
this guy had a simple idea that he took 
all the way to prison and I'm saying it,

1967
01:41:16,531 --> 01:41:19,750
it's inspiring in a weird twist away.
You should never had done that.

1968
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:21,400
Shame on him.
You know,

1969
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:23,440
privacy matters.
Uh,

1970
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:24,683
they should,
they should have never come out and I 

1971
01:41:25,811 --> 01:41:28,510
should have never looked at them.
But that being said,

1972
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:31,023
get inspired.
I think if you look into getting 

1973
01:41:33,131 --> 01:41:33,964
inspired,
you should subscribe to tc or is 

1974
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,050
plugging into theory.
They need all the help.

1975
01:41:41,051 --> 01:41:43,280
They can get bumped.
Everything.

1976
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:46,823
I'm not enough subscribers.
I feel awful for those slip that that 

1977
01:41:49,961 --> 01:41:50,794
was a huge violence.
I want to make clear that I was a huge 

1978
01:41:52,631 --> 01:41:55,690
violation and,
and uh,

1979
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:59,050
a real,
a real wacky shame,

1980
01:41:59,051 --> 01:42:00,120
you know?
But Hey,

1981
01:42:00,850 --> 01:42:02,170
there's something inspiring there 
though.

1982
01:42:02,171 --> 01:42:03,520
You have to admit,
nope.

1983
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:07,550
Just a little piece of shit that was 
going to,

1984
01:42:07,551 --> 01:42:08,800
you know what?
You know what he did?

1985
01:42:08,801 --> 01:42:13,750
It's like that movie,
the pursuit of happiness with will smith

1986
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,600
where he had like the Rubik's cube and 
that got him the job.

1987
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:18,243
It's like the simple plan,
get you all the way and that's what's 

1988
01:42:22,361 --> 01:42:26,680
inspiring and went on and to follow 
along.

1989
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:28,413
Okay,
let's move on.

1990
01:42:29,890 --> 01:42:31,450
Thank you.
Move waiting for that.

1991
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,460
Uh,
up next.

1992
01:42:33,630 --> 01:42:34,960
God,
this is going on and on.

1993
01:42:34,961 --> 01:42:36,570
We have a lot more here.
Good.

1994
01:42:36,571 --> 01:42:37,404
Kind of exhausted.
I wonder if we should move some of this 

1995
01:42:38,261 --> 01:42:40,090
over.
We could skip.

1996
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:42,670
We've got Ariana groped.
We've got,

1997
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:43,623
uh,
Michael Coen starts to go fuck me and 

1998
01:42:48,731 --> 01:42:50,110
that.
We're going to go to that one.

1999
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:53,470
Hmm.
Love that story.

2000
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:54,833
Well,
they're already under groped is pretty 

2001
01:42:55,601 --> 01:42:57,430
amazing too.
All right,

2002
01:42:57,431 --> 01:43:01,090
let's just finish it up.
Arriana groped.

2003
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:02,710
So,
oh man.

2004
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:08,670
Ariana Grande Day is at the funeral of a
wreath,

2005
01:43:08,671 --> 01:43:13,671
the Franklin and this slimy,
slimy dude,

2006
01:43:15,191 --> 01:43:16,024
man.

2007
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:22,530
Gropes her alive during a funeral.
It's crazy shit ever.

2008
01:43:24,341 --> 01:43:27,100
It reminds me of this clip.
We watched him w Lou Walsh grabbing that

2009
01:43:27,101 --> 01:43:27,934
girl's ass on TV.
It's like they have a secret society 

2010
01:43:30,701 --> 01:43:33,300
where they're like,
I'm going to,

2011
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:34,333
they're like,
hey,

2012
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:36,370
they like push the boundary with each 
other.

2013
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:41,110
You know what I mean?
I'm going to grow up a famous person and

2014
01:43:41,111 --> 01:43:41,944
what are they going to say?
It's not even about the famous person 

2015
01:43:45,611 --> 01:43:47,110
there.
They're not there anymore because it's,

2016
01:43:47,111 --> 01:43:48,670
yeah,
but there's a sick mind.

2017
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,010
It's like they're daring each other to 
get away with the

2018
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:53,353
stunt.

2019
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:55,260
Oh yeah.
But I'm sure he did.

2020
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:57,470
I don't look at it like that.
I just think it's,

2021
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:00,650
it's just like what is going on in your 
head?

2022
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:02,270
So here it is anyway,

2023
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:06,373
because

2024
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:12,750
I have to brush up my pants under her.
But when I saw out the on the program,

2025
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:18,880
I thought that this is a new something 
at Taco Bell.

2026
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:22,153
Meanwhile,
saying that he thought she was a Taco 

2027
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:25,370
Bell Item,
Aka a snack,

2028
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:28,153
and

2029
01:44:29,290 --> 01:44:32,070
the most thing that he's doing with his 
hand is something stolen.

2030
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:37,080
Unnatural.
Enjoy this icon here.

2031
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:40,450
Yeah,
he's like digging in here.

2032
01:44:40,451 --> 01:44:42,430
I've got a gift so you can look at more 
closely.

2033
01:44:42,431 --> 01:44:45,010
But I like how he's saying on one hand I
grow.

2034
01:44:45,011 --> 01:44:49,120
I got to give you all your restraint.
Now give me that titty.

2035
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:52,690
Oh goodness.
Look how he's like,

2036
01:44:53,530 --> 01:44:58,530
he's like really grabbing,
I mean that's intentional.

2037
01:44:59,671 --> 01:45:00,960
As it gets.
Right.

2038
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:01,794
I mean,
there's no way to explain it any other 

2039
01:45:02,971 --> 01:45:03,804
way,
right?

2040
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:07,500
No,
it's like this and he's like digging in,

2041
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:09,450
you know?
Yeah.

2042
01:45:10,830 --> 01:45:11,730
That's so creepy.

2043
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:15,003
Okay,

2044
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,930
good to see these men of God lately are 
not winning.

2045
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:22,010
The hearts and minds are not winning my 
heart and mind.

2046
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:29,350
I guess that's all there is to that one.
Yeah.

2047
01:45:29,470 --> 01:45:31,510
He apologize.
Whatever.

2048
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:33,513
Um,

2049
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:34,483
oh,
can you just get away with an apology 

2050
01:45:35,071 --> 01:45:35,850
though?
Well,

2051
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:37,980
the church just like want to get rid of 
that guy immediately.

2052
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,040
Well,
here's what I don't understand.

2053
01:45:39,410 --> 01:45:41,590
It was really half assed too.
Maybe you can find it.

2054
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:43,210
I thought I had it here.
Can you guys find it?

2055
01:45:43,690 --> 01:45:44,860
Sure.
He's just like,

2056
01:45:44,861 --> 01:45:45,820
you know,
uh,

2057
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:51,040
I guess maybe I pushed it.
I was hugging everyone anyway.

2058
01:45:51,041 --> 01:45:52,720
I apologize.
It was basically just that

2059
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,553
said,
it would never be my intention to touch 

2060
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:57,970
any woman's breasts.
I don't know.

2061
01:45:58,150 --> 01:46:01,390
I guess I put my arm around her.
Maybe I crossed the border.

2062
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:03,880
Maybe I was too friendly or familiar.
But again,

2063
01:46:03,881 --> 01:46:05,650
I apologize.
Here we've got a video of it.

2064
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:07,830
Okay.

2065
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:09,090
Bishop Ellis.
By the way,

2066
01:46:09,091 --> 01:46:10,980
let's just say his name for the record.

2067
01:46:11,450 --> 01:46:14,690
I apologize because

2068
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:18,640
I have to brush up.
My 20 year old daughter tells me,

2069
01:46:18,641 --> 01:46:20,320
dad,
you are old and 16

2070
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:24,173
fan

2071
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:27,110
girl.
Did they give you all your respect?

2072
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:35,510
I certainly want to apologize to Ariana 
and to her fans and to our family and to

2073
01:46:36,450 --> 01:46:37,283
entire community.
If what I say said was taken on the 

2074
01:46:40,501 --> 01:46:41,970
wrong way,
and Alyssa,

2075
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:43,760
oh,
he's talking about the Taco bell comment

2076
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:48,410
to the tick groping,
yet he's got a lot to answer for.

2077
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,080
Maybe it's just

2078
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:50,913
a joke that went bad,
but when you're doing the program for 

2079
01:46:52,931 --> 01:46:55,360
nine hours,
you know and tried to keep it lively,

2080
01:46:55,361 --> 01:46:58,300
you're trying to make some funny 
references and what have you.

2081
01:46:58,630 --> 01:46:59,463
I love everybody.
Everybody that knows the visibility and 

2082
01:47:01,570 --> 01:47:04,270
greater reason than those that we love 
everybody and listen,

2083
01:47:04,630 --> 01:47:07,540
it's not about whether I meant or didn't
mean it,

2084
01:47:08,230 --> 01:47:09,910
but whether somebody took it the wrong 
way,

2085
01:47:10,450 --> 01:47:14,560
I'm the one that said it and if it was 
taken up to be an offensive statement,

2086
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:18,010
I apologize.
That's the easiest thing for me to do,

2087
01:47:18,011 --> 01:47:18,844
the right thing for me to do.
And I certainly hope that she would 

2088
01:47:21,181 --> 01:47:22,014
forgive me.
And the last thing you want to do is to 

2089
01:47:23,861 --> 01:47:24,694
be a distraction.
Didn't address the Franklin meaning of 

2090
01:47:27,131 --> 01:47:28,540
soul.
This is all about her.

2091
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:32,680
It's not about me.
And I'm so sorry if I inserted myself in

2092
01:47:32,681 --> 01:47:34,240
a way that took away from this.

2093
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,740
So I apologize Ariana and to her 
community,

2094
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:42,900
he never addressed the tick grab.
He addressed the top of Bell Rondae.

2095
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:44,033
Uh,
comment.

2096
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:45,453
All right,
well the thing is I've only seen it and 

2097
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:51,100
like a clip of it that I thought was in 
reference,

2098
01:47:51,101 --> 01:47:51,934
but I watched the whole thing.
He didn't even address the fricking tit 

2099
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:57,940
dig.
The thing is when you grab a lady here,

2100
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:01,060
I don't know if she was wearing a wire 
bra,

2101
01:48:01,061 --> 01:48:03,130
but first of all there's a wire that's 
so obvious,

2102
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:04,203
but even if not like this motion here is
really like he was getting sexual 

2103
01:48:10,481 --> 01:48:11,314
gratification from that.
Are you trying to massage her tit and 

2104
01:48:14,261 --> 01:48:15,100
turn her on?
I mean,

2105
01:48:15,101 --> 01:48:17,890
what are you trying to do?
Or is it just a weird,

2106
01:48:17,891 --> 01:48:20,050
creepy old world power play of being 
like,

2107
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:22,400
I can do this and get away with it?
You know,

2108
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:25,210
so weird as shit.

2109
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:27,863
Yeah.

2110
01:48:28,330 --> 01:48:29,970
Hopefully this guy's gone,
man.

2111
01:48:30,030 --> 01:48:33,270
I'm sick of these fucking holy men.

2112
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:37,670
Like anyway,

2113
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:39,430
anything else to add to that?
You'll

2114
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:40,893
nope.

2115
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:49,060
That's due to get like grow up like that
on live TV during a funeral.

2116
01:48:49,281 --> 01:48:50,420
I'm like,
she can't say anything.

2117
01:48:50,570 --> 01:48:53,310
She was recoiling from it.
Yeah.

2118
01:48:53,311 --> 01:48:55,040
It's fine.
Those situations,

2119
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:57,680
you can't really say anything.
It's just really,

2120
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:02,270
because it's not that bad.
It's just like right on the line.

2121
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:04,190
The cribs zone.
Yeah.

2122
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:06,020
It's like why you got to be such a 
creep.

2123
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:06,973
Yeah.

2124
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:08,590
Okay.

2125
01:49:08,590 --> 01:49:12,610
And finally a tragic story to end the 
episode.

2126
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:15,370
Uh,
poor Michael Cohen.

2127
01:49:15,910 --> 01:49:17,200
Uh,
you know,

2128
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:19,570
the sad,
unfortunate Michael Cohen,

2129
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:22,210
trump's attorney that has flipped on 
him,

2130
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:24,010
uh,
to work with the FBI,

2131
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:29,620
um,
has started a go fund me to help pay his

2132
01:49:30,641 --> 01:49:31,474
legal fees and I'm,
we're just all so very heartbroken over 

2133
01:49:33,611 --> 01:49:34,240
this.
Dan,

2134
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:36,910
can you cue the music please?
Um,

2135
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,150
to help set the mood?
Um,

2136
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:44,820
crickets.
We have crickets,

2137
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:46,933
Dan

2138
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:50,680
family.
I wouldn't say it's off.

2139
01:49:50,681 --> 01:49:51,970
Mike Schraeder pooped.

2140
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:52,610
Okay.

2141
01:49:52,610 --> 01:49:54,350
He pooped in the office.
Yeah,

2142
01:49:54,351 --> 01:49:59,351
I'm calling to birthday.
That was the only reason we're uh,

2143
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,930
we're let him get away with it or you 
know,

2144
01:50:09,590 --> 01:50:11,420
hopefully our office manager didn't see 
this.

2145
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:17,840
Um,
so I apologize.

2146
01:50:17,841 --> 01:50:19,010
Are we talking about Michael Cohen?
Yeah,

2147
01:50:19,011 --> 01:50:19,731
we're boy.
Yeah,

2148
01:50:19,731 --> 01:50:21,310
we're talking about boy.
Um

2149
01:50:23,330 --> 01:50:25,600
Huh.
Um,

2150
01:50:26,910 --> 01:50:28,530
yeah,
we wanted some sad music.

2151
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:30,670
5% went to say I'm sorry.
Shredder.

2152
01:50:30,671 --> 01:50:34,910
I feel bad for Port Frederick.
Alright.

01:50:36,030 --> 01:50:41,030
Michael Cohen,

2154
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:43,523
2018,
Michael Cohen declared his independence 

2155
01:50:45,090 --> 01:50:45,923
from Donald Trump and his commitment to 
tell the truth and not because he was 

2156
01:50:51,391 --> 01:50:55,770
strong armed by the FBI to avoid 
criminal charges against himself.

2157
01:50:57,390 --> 01:50:58,223
Michael Cohen made the decision to take 
a legal responsibility and continuous 

2158
01:51:01,231 --> 01:51:02,064
commitment to tell the truth.

2191
01:53:08,871 --> 01:53:13,500
crimes he committed and he won't be able
to.

2192
01:53:13,501 --> 01:53:14,334

2193
01:53:17,881 --> 01:53:18,714
longer folks.

2194
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,640
And with that I say we're pretty much 
done.

So guys,
you can keep it going.

2196
01:53:27,211 --> 01:53:29,970
I was enjoying that.
I don't know.

2197
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:31,560
It started over.
So guys,

2198
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:32,573

the spirit of telling truth and 

2199
01:53:35,191 --> 01:53:37,210
spreading justice in this planet,
in this earth,

2200
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:43,650
and I know you're not worth 100 million,
you don't make $1 million a year like my

2201
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,000
colon,
but you could spare a buck.

2202
01:53:48,870 --> 01:53:51,570
And so remember to join us a week from

about hopefully sending up a truth fund 

2210
01:54:13,741 --> 01:54:18,741
for Michael Cohen.
Bill burr flies helicopters.

2211
01:54:19,441 --> 01:54:24,441
He can afford to give this guy 10 bucks.
I actually should ask bill about this.

2212
01:54:25,111 --> 01:54:30,111
I'm curious what this tape.
So thank you all for tuning in.

No.
Are you feeling sad for Michael Cohen?

2221
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:04,993
Really Sad.
Do you have money to donate to Michael 

2222
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,310
Cohen?
Really Ila,

2223
