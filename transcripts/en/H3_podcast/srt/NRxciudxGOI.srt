1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,393
I agree.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,480
Look who's back again,
this guy and his wife,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,060
couple of people just sitting at a table
talking about also known as a podcast,

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:14,923
that podcast guide.
Today's episode is sponsored by Meant

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,220
Thanks dude.
Dan was walking back.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,410
No,
that's how everyone felt though.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,150
Touching souls here.
Dan.

12
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:42,650
Bless you guys.
Give us a ring at eight.

13
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:43,610
Oh,
eight hot meme.

14
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:46,070
One lucky color will get a chance to 
play.

15
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:48,390
Know your meme.
That's right.

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,850
So it's fresh online to win a brand new 
Samsung Galaxy s nine.

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,570
Compliments of Samsung featuring run for
the cube.

18
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,670
Yes,
run for the cube.

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,773
Does the legendary green beloved candy 
surgeon hit me with some of those sound 

20
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:05,534
effects.
Was a pipe refresh their memory if we 

21
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:13,121
could.
More sound,

22
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:20,030
but that's great.
Excellent.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,553
Next week on Wednesday,
we've got the two legends with Thompson 

24
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,740

He is a youtube legend.

31
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:49,930
He's doing.
He's on an island in a sense.

32
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:53,920
He's creating some of the best original 
creative content I've seen on youtube.

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,100
I'm not much is known about him

34
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:59,590

Have him on the show.

35
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,000
That's at a couple of weeks from now.
I'm very excited about that.

36
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,610
Thank you guys.
Halloween,

37
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:08,440
uh,
how was your Halloween,

38
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:10,780
Neela?
Very boring.

39
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,753
Yeah.
We didn't even have one person knocking 

40
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:18,280
on the door.
Not One.

41
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,160
What happened to Halloween when I was a 
kid.

42
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:23,890
It was like a block party.
I was telling Isla I walk.

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,560
I see kids these days with little 
pumpkin buckets.

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,513
That's cute.
I used to walk around with a fricken 

45
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,120
pillow case because I was out.
Candy.

46
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:37,570
What is currency at that age?
Are you kidding me?

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,730
That's like getting once for the Strip 
joint.

48
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,593
No,
I could imagine because in Israel we 

49
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:43,390
don't do it,
so I don't,

50
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,360
I've never experienced it.
I loved candy.

51
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,190
Well you had a little taste of it 
because,

52
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:50,770
um,
we were walking down the street.

53
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,610
There is nobody there.
The Sun is like set.

54
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,370
It's a beautiful.
People have decorated,

55
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,970
you know,
and there's one some kid

56
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,953
and,
and,

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,350
and I'm like,
dude,

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,860
we only saw one kid,
super long suburban block,

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,650
just one kid and two parents.
And I was like,

60
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,320
that's just,
that's so crappy.

61
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,300
What's going on?
That is bizarre.

62
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,920
Just one poor kid.
I was like,

63
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,930
I'd be embarrassed about that kid.
Where's everybody?

64
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,290
Um,
but anyway,

65
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,011
there was,
you know,

66
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,240
how people,
when they're not there,

67
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,190
they bring,
they have a little bucket that says,

68
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:26,980
only take one.
So me and Isla,

69
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,814
we're walking our dog and somebody was 
kind enough to put out one of these 

70
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:33,940
buckets and we took one and it was a 
joy.

71
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:35,770
I have to tell you what the joy wasn't 
an enjoy.

72
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,590
What Kennedy did you get you a gummy 
bears,

73
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,240
gummy bears.
I got the uh,

74
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,370
milk duds.
That's,

75
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,150
that was always my favorite.
The milk duds,

76
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,310
uh,
as starburst person,

77
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,330
but as I,
as I get older and I eat milk duds,

78
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:51,220
I realize not good.

79
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,600
I liked the flavor,
but it's such a Schlep to put those down

80
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,510
is the Carmel just gets everywhere.
Damn.

81
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,140
As a kid,
you don't give a fuck that you eat those

82
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,060
like aspirin.
When I was a kid,

83
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,970
reese's cups that,
that was like the Bitcoin,

84
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,060
the one candy there would always be 
like,

85
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,983
you get this huge pillowcase and then 
over the course of a month you would 

86
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:17,260
have like whatever,
eat everything,

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,273
have little kitty diabetes,
and then all this shitty candies would 

88
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:23,590
be left that you don't like.
So the ones that I,

89
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,250
there were always left for me where I'm 
nerds hate nerds.

90
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,250
Oh Dude.
I hate nerds.

91
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,570
They're these sour little pebbles hate 
nerds.

92
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,680
They're so lame compared to a male 
judge.

93
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,460
But that's what I'm saying.
Yeah,

94
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,020
you would,
you would broke,

95
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,130
you would broker the shitty candy with 
other people.

96
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,490
Be like,
you want some nerds?

97
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,630
And they'd be like,
you want milk duds?

98
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:47,620
And I'm like,
no,

99
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,890
this is,
this is like a little less than in world

100
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,780
trade.
You know what I mean?

101
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,313
It was a beautiful thing.
So the suckers like these little shitty 

102
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:01,270
suckers you get in doctor's office,
like give me a break.

103
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,740
There's cock suckers in this planet that
are giving out.

104
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:08,200
Like I remember someone giving up 
pennies,

105
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,870
pennies,
pennies,

106
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,460
and I remember people can and got like 
fruit and I'm like,

107
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,960
oh,
cool for you dude.

108
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,260
You're doing a little protest against 
candy on Halloween.

109
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,310
You get a fucking life on another day.
Yeah.

110
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:26,710
But I love Halloween and sadly,
I don't know.

111
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:29,020
In La you just have to know where to go.
I don't know.

112
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,840
I guess our neighborhood was literally 
empty.

113
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,400
Yeah,
last night at the same thing.

114
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,040
Not even an exaggeration.
It was actually empty.

115
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,140
But I hope you all had a wonderful 
blessing.

116
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,180
Halloween full of spooks and streets.
I've got some great halloween footage.

117
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,990
Just share with you guys at the top of 
this beautiful Friday afternoon.

118
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,683
Uh,
I just remembered I did want to give a 

119
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,153
shredder or update.
A lot of people still think that it's 

120
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,100
poop.
Oh No,

121
00:05:59,101 --> 00:05:59,391
no,
no,

122
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,224
no,
just because I say it sometimes I just 

123
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:03,860
want to say stop doing that.
He's a good boy.

124
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:05,390
Now.
He's a sweet angel.

125
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,540
He's a big boy.
He doesn't need this.

126
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,800
I don't want to misrepresent shredder.
No,

127
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,634
he's not a shitty leader.
He hasn't eaten shit and I know he 

128
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,740
doesn't do it anymore.
One day he was like,

129
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:16,574
Hey,
you know what,

130
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,543
I'm going to stop eating shit.
And wasn't that a great day for all of 

131
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:21,434
us?
Because sometimes he come and lick you 

132
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:24,690
right in the mouth and you'd be like,
dude,

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,720
dude,
cute.

134
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,550
And also I can taste shit.

135
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,730
You just eat shit.
Like threw in the towel,

136
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,253
but I love you.
Anyway.

137
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,790
That's kind of what parenthood is,
right?

138
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,150
Probably you just shut my mouth and I 
love you.

139
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,603
So we spoke about these gracious people 
that leave the buckets of candy in the 

140
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:44,834
front yard that says only take one,
but as you may or may not know as 

141
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:49,094
Halloween is new to you,
there's always some piece of crap that 

142
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:56,981
dumps the whole fricken bucket out into 
their pillow case and it just,

143
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,690
it's not right.
It's not right,

144
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,000
but here now I've got some clips of my 
favorite that I've found of this year.

145
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:10,001
These are all fresh of parents getting 
in on the good spirit.

146
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,090
Halloween,
no isla take.

147
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,210
We are about to have a kid,
so notice on the good parenting.

148
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,160
Now I want to feel.
I want to point something out.

149
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,480
This sweetheart.
Take one.

150
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,120
Exactly.
The kid has a sweet,

151
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:27,390
pure heart.
He reads the sign and he says,

152
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,180
I'll only take one.
I'm a sweet,

153
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:32,520
pure soul,
but life.

154
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:34,380
This is what happens when life gets to 
you.

155
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,890
You become this lady and here's why.

156
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,570
One Hand not,
not only for the bucket full can be.

157
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,310
What is he going to deal with it?

158
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,260
She's scooping it like it's her life.
Depends on it.

159
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,340
And she got the poor kid like that's the
example that he has to follow.

160
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,800
I know it breaks my heart because he was
a sweet kid.

161
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,150
It's like it's just candy lady.
What is,

162
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,320
what is he saying?
Like,

163
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:15,320
no,
at the end there.

164
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,680
Let's see.
I'm curious.

165
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,533
He's like,
Mommy,

166
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,393
Halloween

167
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,593
sacred.

168
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,970
The kid is saying,
mommy,

169
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,520
come on.
Oh man,

170
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:29,720
that breaks my heart.

171
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,783
Yeah.

172
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,031
I said,
mommy,

173
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:34,440
come on.
You can only take one.

174
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,010
Good.
What a sweet soul.

175
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,720
What do you mean?
What's the,

176
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:44,820
is still candy.
It's insulin.

177
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,830
You know what I mean?
Uh,

178
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,050
what are they,
you know,

179
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,800
this kid,
this kid is not,

180
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,640
doesn't have a good shot of coming up.
Right?

181
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,140
But he has pure heart and I love that 
forum.

182
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,350
When your eight year old has a better 
moral compass thing.

183
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,223
Also don't people under like I always 
see videos of people stealing packages 

184
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,441
from front doors.
It's like,

185
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:08,850
you know,
that everybody has like,

186
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,870
ring now we're all watching them.
People didn't catch up yet.

187
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,730
Yeah,
we're watching.

188
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,750
Um,
so there you go.

189
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,490
You know,
stealing it like her life depends on it.

190
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,820
I saw one comment on the video that 
said,

191
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,950
what are the chances that kid sees any 
of it?

192
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,320
That candy?
Yeah.

193
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,020
I'm wondering too,
because is it for her?

194
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,810
Why would she care about that?
And just buy a candy.

195
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,260
You can get so much candy for like $1 at
Ralph's.

196
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,650
Yeah.
Also the sales the next day are freaking

197
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:44,484
nuts.
So here's a family that ran sensible 

198
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,120
little a pick me up on this Friday 
afternoon,

199
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,760
ring.com
monster.

200
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,880
Yes sir.

201
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Okay man,
this is a few years later.

202
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,000
The kids got used to it,

203
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,660
but it's like,
Yo,

204
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,460
it's not a riot.
There's flooding.

205
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,990
There's not a Zombie apocalypse.
Some fucking snuck one in the house.

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,833
Look there.

207
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,343
Well,
gender,

208
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,641
that's like,
come on,

209
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:32,900
let's go.
You don't rob people on any other day.

210
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,280
That's what you're doing.
You're robbing.

211
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,250
You don't go feel shit.
What happened?

212
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:40,240
They left the little girl and she's,
they opened the door.

213
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,830
They left the little girl.
Yeah.

214
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,263
Ooh,

215
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,263
I missed that.
Great parents take note because we have 

216
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:58,970
a lot to learn about parenting.
I can't wait to ransacks.

217
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,010
And uh,
and then finally,

218
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,600
um,
the theme of Halloween,

219
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,980
this one is old.

220
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,180
Do you sometimes wish that April theme 
of,

221
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,250
you know,
dressing up in a costume.

222
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,323
These guys were promoting a musical and 
Ninja turtles musical and they started 

223
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:19,524
talking about wanting to bang April and 
there's like all these kids there who 

224
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:25,104
are like turtles,
mega fans that I was just blown away by 

225
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:29,880
this clip.
It's a y and incredible thing

226
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,210
was the turtle.
Actually.

227
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,040
That works for me,
but April was a turtle.

228
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,230
Do you wish April?
Actually,

229
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,064
that works for me so far.
I've been trying to talk her into an 

230
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:53,610
inter species relationships for months.
She do it.

231
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,700
No,
she can't hold her breath long enough.

232
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,210
You know,
want to run

233
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,500
sprain on April.
That's not Canon.

234
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,130
That is not part of the Ninja Turtles.
Laura.

235
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,090
Hey,
April.

236
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:09,924
You want to ride?
You want to have an interspecies 

237
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,390
relationship with all four of us.
Too Bad.

238
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:18,480
You can't hold her breath long enough.
I'm going to drown her in ges.

239
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,850
Well,
because the turtles aren't in water.

240
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,373
You know they walk around the earth.
Did they mean that they think she says 

241
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:26,994
they can't hold her breath long enough?
I assume he means because turtles are 

242
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,130
water creatures.
I've gotten beaming because they think.

243
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,230
Why would that?
Why would she need to be underwater?

244
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,600
Because they stink.
No,

245
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,320
they'll hold her breath.
Oh,

246
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,180
I don't necessarily understand the 
application,

247
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:46,960
but it doesn't seem right either way.
You can't hold her breath long enough,

248
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,050
I assume because they're drowning or in 
com.

249
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,780
So a bunch of fucking heavy sectoral 
here.

250
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,793
You know what I mean?

251
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,500
Look at that.
Look at this.

252
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,230
Look at this.

253
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,250
Kids on the left.
He is traumatized.

254
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,740
I love that black sweater with the two.
Yeah,

255
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,720
that was pretty bad.
Uh,

256
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,303
I love that.
As far as good at this poor kid on the 

257
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:13,831
left,
man.

258
00:13:13,831 --> 00:13:16,110
He,
that no kid should see.

259
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,420
Hey,
because you know,

260
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,403
every kid has a kind of a crush on April
because she's kind of a hot cartoon 

261
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:22,554
character and he probably wants to fuck 
April and now all of a sudden he's got 

262
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:29,580
to imagine his turtle friends blocking 
him.

263
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,240
Yeah.
He's ahead of his time.

264
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,390
He's like,
this is a me too.

265
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,450
Me Too moment.
Donna Tello.

266
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:38,810
Yeah.

267
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,110
Panels are going to perform their hit.
Did you want to change?

268
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,230
I love to.
The kids

269
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:55,230
cut to the kids dramatize.
It looks like an adult just like,

270
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,500
Damn Donna Tello.

271
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,493
Did you want me to say something?
I'll see you after to say that being in 

272
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,010
a report type for me not to analyze,
and a good thing about these guys

273
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,160
is that they're huge turtle Cox.
They might be turtles,

274
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:20,180
but they're hung like a horse,
so there you go.

275
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,280
Happy Halloween.
Everybody.

276
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,830
I'm feeling better by the way.
Thank you for asking.

277
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,240
Still have a cough that is just brutal,
but let's talk about Isla.

278
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,690
Who's pregnant?
[inaudible].

279
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,590
How are you feeling?
I feel okay.

280
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,510
No morning sickness.
No,

281
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,870
you're gaining weight.
Gaining weight.

282
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,040
I'm not fitting in my pants already.
And didn't you?

283
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,380
I have to say this.
You got fucking bat dog.

284
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,280
I have to say it,
dude.

285
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,370
Why do you say daddy's got fucking math?
That's not good there.

286
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,970
All right.
We're talking about being pregnant.

287
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:05,720
You know,
I'm just.

288
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,300
I'm just noticing the changes that are 
happening to your body.

289
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,490
I Guess Daddy.
Oh,

290
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,660
we got our first ultrasound.
We saw the baby.

291
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,680
You're thickening up is my point.
Like it's.

292
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:22,910
You get.
How much weight have you gained since we

293
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:27,380
found out like a five or six pounds.
It's pretty amazing.

294
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,400
Something that.
No,

295
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,230
you look.
Did you look amazing?

296
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,830
I just want to say you look so 
beautiful.

297
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:36,200
So radiant.
You look amazing.

298
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,020
You were like,
I'm telling you,

299
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,943
you're free.
Even like to think it's amazing that 

300
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:44,550
you're pregnant.
Yeah.

301
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,730
Yeah.
And so we saw,

302
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,910
we saw the little pipsqueak because we 
did an ultrasound and I'm here.

303
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:56,240
I got a video for you.
It's such a trip to me.

304
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,423
Uh,
you can see the heartbeat in this whole 

305
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,490
fucking bought this little fuck.

306
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,670
And the doctor said he looks like a 
gummy bear.

307
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,440
Yeah.
He's a little gummy bear.

308
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,953
Yeah.
He,

309
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:07,900
she,
I don't know.

310
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,000
But you see the heartbeat right here.
Here.

311
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:10,834
Let me pull the screen up

312
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,730
thing man.
That's inside Ila.

313
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,630
That's not crazy.
And it's like moving.

314
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,220
Yeah,
he's swimming around.

315
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,540
He's legs are wiggling and shit.
So crazy.

316
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,703
So this is the head and the body and the
arms and legs are starting to form and 

317
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:29,990
he's got a little heartbeat.

318
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,433
Good to go.

319
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,950
That little guy is cooking up in your 
stomach.

320
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,730
It's so weird.
How does it feel like that?

321
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,040
There's like a license life growing

322
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,300
in you and so weird because I don't feel
it don't,

323
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,050
but like do you know that it's there.
It's crazy.

324
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,380
It's pretty magical,
I guess.

325
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,400
I don't know.
It's like,

326
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,290
yeah,
what we're meant to do,

327
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,124
but it's so insane.
It's interesting how we're so removed 

328
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:07,190
from nature in a way that we find like 
birth to be so magical,

329
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:09,930
but it is magical.
Yeah.

330
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,280
It's really something.
I just fuck it.

331
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,720
We just did it.
You know what I mean?

332
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Now there's a little heartbeat inside of
you and are we run the danger of gushing

333
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:22,994
over our kids and nobody cares.
I'm already gushing over this little 

334
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,140
because I saw people.
I'm asking for the baby updates.

335
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,353
Right?
So I guess let us know because I know I 

336
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:38,570
hate hearing about other people's kids 
and I,

337
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,220
and I was like,
everybody does.

338
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,900
And it's like because you don't,
you know.

339
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,350
That's true.
I never understood how special it feels.

340
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,273
Yeah.
And so I don't know for already running 

341
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:52,680
that danger.
It's like an ultrasound.

342
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:55,920
It's like I already loved that little 
gummy bear looking at him.

343
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:58,310
He's dude,
his heartbeat is so strong.

344
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,043
His heartbeat is so strong.
What they say on the DNA test at the 

345
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,610
super athlete body,
a super athlete heartbeat.

346
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:11,100
I'm telling you,
he's going to be president someday.

347
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,090
I want to wish I wouldn't wish being 
president on my worst enemy.

348
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,510
Talk about the worst job in the world 
right there it is,

349
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:24,290
man.
Isla is doing great too.

350
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,210
You are doing great.
You get a little tired.

351
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:29,990
Sometimes.
I get really tired and I,

352
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,510
I get pretty hungry and then eat and 
then I'm like,

353
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,140
then I'm ready to sleep.
I'm kind kinda like a baby.

354
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:38,640
Like I'm eating,
sleeping.

355
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,310
You have a life for sucking your energy 
out.

356
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,140
You have a foreign.
You're a host and I do have cravings for

357
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:49,260
people who were wondering if it's true 
or not.

358
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,343
So like all of a sudden I really feel 
like eating something Mac and cheese 

359
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:55,410
this morning or I'll really not feel 
like eating something.

360
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,550
Mexican food.
Yeah.

361
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,840
It's so weird.
It was like,

362
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:58,980
I don't want Mexican food anymore.
I'm like,

363
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,690
what's up?
Usually I love it.

364
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,520
It's like all wheat this morning.
She's like,

365
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,180
Ethan,
you need to make mack a treat.

366
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,250
Cope,
and I did.

367
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:09,000
It's like,
Oh,

368
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,850
I was walking straight and all of a 
sudden I'm like Mac and cheese.

369
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,373
That's what I did.
But the interesting thing is about the 

370
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:20,541
cravings is that I wonder if there's 
really some actual science behind it.

371
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,250
We're there is because there was one 
week where all of a sudden every night I

372
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:27,560
want to add a mommy.

373
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,660
I feel aware.
Yeah.

374
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:30,494
And so soybean and it's,
I think it's really good for you to be 

375
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,000
so and,
and now I'm completely over it.

376
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,080
I don't,
I can't touch it.

377
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,973
Interestingly,
that was before we knew you were 

378
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:40,230
pregnant,
but I was,

379
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,920
I dunno,
but like you were craving Mac and cheese

380
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:44,754
and I wonder if you needed like calcium 
and the vitamins and all this dairy and 

381
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:48,620
stuff.
Some awesome.

382
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,700
Even butter and cheese,
fat,

383
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,940
lots of fat,
you know,

384
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,700
very cool man.
Very exciting stuff.

385
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,010
You know,
but I have so much appreciation.

386
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,903
I really do know that you are raising 
this child and your stomach and you're 

387
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:07,824
going to give birth to this child.
I'm really afraid of that guys have to 

388
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:11,754
do is not.
There's nothing easier in the world and 

389
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:18,750
nutting I think I'll be okay until like 
the fifth month or something.

390
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,290
But then things started to get hard.
I'm scared.

391
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,780
I'm scared of that part.
I know you're scared,

392
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:28,520
but I'm excited because I know it's 
going to be fine and I know you're going

393
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,354
to be great and I can't wait to see the 
transformation and everything and all 

394
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:36,330
the changes and like you growing,
it's going to be so wild,

395
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,340
but I understand you're scared.
It is scared.

396
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:39,174
I'd be scared too if it was me,
but I know everything's going to be 

397
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:45,390
great and I'm looking at like maternity 
clothes and it's so not my style.

398
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:47,540
It's got to be hip.
Oh No.

399
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,130
What am I going to wear?
I already don't feel my clothes.

400
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,580
I wonder if there's any Gucci,
maternity pants.

401
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:59,581
We can get you all swagged out.
And we started looking at baby stuff.

402
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,483
We bought some baby clothes for our 
friends and they're like so freaking 

403
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:07,210
cool and obviously way more affordable 
than like adult clothes.

404
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,920
And I was like,
Oh,

405
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,350
I understand why you have multiple kids.
It's like,

406
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:13,450
I'm not going to let this sit close.
Go to waste.

407
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,660
I'm having another kid just so I can put
them in this dope ass clothes again.

408
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,150
You know?
But I swear to God,

409
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:22,984
I'm just like,
I'm gushing over ela because it's just 

410
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:28,480
amazing.
I know.

411
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,850
It's amazing.
I shear so cool.

412
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,570
It's amazing.
Seriously.

413
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:35,440
Something else,
man.

414
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,210
So there you go.

415
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,570
There's a baby update for you.
Let us know.

416
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,570
It's too much.
You know,

417
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,310
if you're over.
Stopped with the baby.

418
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,600
I get it.
He's got a heartbeat.

419
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,770
All babies have rp.
No,

420
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,030
but not all babies have a heartbeat like
that one.

421
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,960
Did they all look like a gummy bear?
No.

422
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,900
By the way,
that heartbeat is like a sick.

423
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,120
I could tell he's got like rhythm and 
soul too.

424
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,430
Like this guy is artistic ash unit is 
empathetic.

425
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,760
Like you're a warrior.
Basically.

426
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:17,080
Gandhi mixed with everything out of the 
best things you can imagine.

427
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:17,711
Boom.
Right?

428
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,790
They're presented with the opportunity 
to steal a bunch of candy.

429
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,830
He would take one politely.
Say,

430
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:24,880
no,
Daddy,

431
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,373
let's get off this.
Now I'm pushing it in too long as the 

432
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:35,281
title of the episode indicates,
Post Malone is under fire by the media.

433
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,293
Now,
let me preface this by saying that post 

434
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:39,664
Malone has become so popular,
so successful this year has been 

435
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:46,954
incredible.
I read something that he has been the 

436
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:53,920
most streamed in the most popular 
musician of this entire year.

437
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,843
He is the biggest musician in the world.
Two thousand 18 or maybe the United 

438
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,133
States,
I don't know,

439
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,070
but like combined with his first album,
his first album.

440
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:03,904
You guys,
Baroque Michael Jackson's thriller 

441
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,763
record for being on like the top 10 
billboard for the longest consecutive 

442
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,260
weeks.
Okay.

443
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,760
Do we have no internet?
Oh,

444
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,620
I have internet.
You know,

445
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,410
I think so Dan.
I have Internet.

446
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,040
Thank God we have a backup system for 
them.

447
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,353
Anyway,
so post Malone has been wildly 

448
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,740
successful and I would say he has 
critics,

449
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:39,010
but from the fans and the people that 
consume his music,

450
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,660
he always loved you.
Always had gotten a lot of shit.

451
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,070
Yeah,
he's gotten a lot of shit.

452
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,010
But the people who give him

453
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,010
shit are kind of like the old guards.
These,

454
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,023
these,
you know,

455
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,240
but the fans,
the consumers,

456
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,990
he's beloved because he's such,
he's got such a great personality.

457
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:01,400
He's such a chill dude.
He,

458
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,960
he,
you know,

459
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,260
he's just a great guy.
There's,

460
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,730
there's no question about that.

461
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,360
Never claimed to want to make anything 
more than just some good music.

462
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,400
Right,
exactly.

463
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:19,380
And this article is exactly,
that's the problem apparently

464
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,460
problem that this Arthur seems to have,
and this is in the Washington Post,

465
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,294
so this is a big reputable.
This was shared with me by a lot of 

466
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:28,074
people.
So I think a lot of eyeballs fell in 

467
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:29,654
this article.
The problem he seems to have is that 

468
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:33,264
he's not woke enough of some sorts or he
sees Postville and success as 

469
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:38,934
symptomatic of all of the problems in 
the world and he makes all these grand 

470
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,050
comparisons to like conservative 
movement.

471
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:46,884
It's very political who he makes 
comparisons to him being like Donald 

472
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,070
Trump,

473
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:55,050
the factory setting it then info.
It's somehow like,

474
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:56,910
now we all need to judge him,
right?

475
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,610
Um,
that he's pro gun or like an Apoc,

476
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,553
you know,
like a doomsday or whatever you want to 

477
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,640
call it.
It's all,

478
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:09,870
you know,
use to paint this picture that he's some

479
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,093
sleeper,
conservative outright troll I think is 

480
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:14,874
kind of somewhat

481
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,910
to tone for sure because there's

482
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,793
not really any proof to support that.
So they kind of try to build this case 

483
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,380
using things that aren't really direct.
Right?

484
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,330
So they don't really come out and say 
it.

485
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,293
But um,
the thing about Austin that I know is 

486
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:36,140
that he's never tried to do or be 
anything.

487
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,200
He's just making music that he likes.
Exactly.

488
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,260
It's from styles that he likes and 
everybody is like,

489
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,970
if you don't like his music,

490
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,210
if you don't like,
it's like,

491
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,260
I don't know,
I just.

492
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,060
The thing about this article,
like it's,

493
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,143
it's interesting and it's worthy of an 
analysis of who he is and why he's 

494
00:25:58,261 --> 00:26:01,110
popular now.
But it's so mean spirited.

495
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,543
It's so mean.
Maybe you should read some from the 

496
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,551
beginning.
Well,

497
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:07,200
let me show you.
First of all,

498
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,680
really pop this open.
The video is so obnoxious.

499
00:26:10,681 --> 00:26:12,490
Okay.
Let's start with this post malone.

500
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,820
You think you know,
but you have no idea.

501
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,373
Also,
the title is post Malone is the perfect 

502
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:21,390
pop star of this American moment and 
that's not a compliment.

503
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,980
Sounds like one God,
that sounds like a nice.

504
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,873
I mean,
why don't you just say what you want to 

505
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,490
say that?
Yeah.

506
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,490
Because she is the author.
He or she,

507
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,353
Jeff Weiss is trying to make this point 
of like he's perfect because of Donald 

508
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:41,330
trump and everything.
And this is why he's.

509
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,860
Let's watch this video.
Thanks for having me.

510
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,291
I,
I,

511
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:46,450
I'm just so,
uh,

512
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,910
you're just so likable and I,
I really am interested in your story.

513
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,963
You might know post Malone as the 
soundcloud rapper who went triple 

514
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:57,020
platinum for his debut track,
White Iverson.

515
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,220
You might know him as the genre bending 
artists combining country.

516
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:01,980
Granted,
you know,

517
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,770
pop in just about every since

518
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,510
also raped babies.
No.

519
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,413
Okay.

520
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,980
Or You may not know him at all,
but you should.

521
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,600
Malone is huge.
For context,

522
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:15,434
his album,
stoney beat out Michael Jackson's 

523
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,690
thriller for most weeks and top 10 on 
the top RMB dies.

524
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,440
That may surprise you.

525
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,300
In fact,
this talentless a hack actually dethrone

526
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:31,260
Michael Jackson.

527
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,870
Do you understand the artists a bit 
better?

528
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,060
Born Austin,
Richard Post,

529
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,953
he became post malone the same way.
Donald Glover became childish Gambino 

530
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,840
through rap name generator.
Malone wasn't always focused on.

531
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,990
Absolutely.
Music is very eerie and in,

532
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:47,261
in,
in,

533
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:47,531
in,
in,

534
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:50,580
in anything.
It's like crunching the numbers a little

535
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,340
fucking spooky,
a little.

536
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,830
Something's wrong here.

537
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,510
He learned how to play guitar by playing
guitar hero.

538
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,570
I started playing a guitar because I 
felt cool with the controller,

539
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,720
so I says,
let me do the real thing in Hollywood.

540
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,950
They're part of a heavy metal band.
He credits Bob.

541
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:13,950
Dylan is one of his major influences.
Executives.

542
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:14,784
Record company.
Republic records have described Malone 

543
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,860
as the Donald Trump of hip hop because 
quote things that should have killed his

544
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,820
career.
He only made him bigger.

545
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,013
So here they're trying to make an 
unjustified parallel between him and 

546
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:31,530
trump.
Things that should have killed them.

547
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,393
Only made them.
I didn't even know what they're talking 

548
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,040
about.
This was one dude's quo,

549
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,560
but they're just even just by being like
post Malone,

550
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,070
Donald Trump,
even though they say it again in another

551
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:44,580
context in the article.
So like they're kind of,

552
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,833
almost subconsciously in a way being 
like he is Donald Trump and he supports 

553
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:56,190
Donald Trump and you know,
they make it like everything's got to be

554
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:58,110
political,
but he likes guns.

555
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,180
Yeah.
It's like if you're a liberal,

556
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,043
they say like,
if you're a liberal and you believe in 

557
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:06,150
resisting Donald Trump,
then you should hate post malone.

558
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,650
And it's like,
no,

559
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,200
it's got nothing to do with politics.

560
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:11,803
Twenty 16.
He said he considered playing President 

561
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:16,040
Donald Trump's inauguration fast.
Wow.

562
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,930
That's pretty much in 2016.
Wait,

563
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,390
I don't even.
I guess you.

564
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:24,930
Yeah.
What did he know about trump back then?

565
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,773
Like,
nope.

566
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,813
Yes,
but also if a president asked you to 

567
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:34,021
play the inauguration and it's few years
ago too.

568
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,731
He wasn't,
by the way,

569
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:39,970
in 2016,
his first album hadn't even come out.

570
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,920
He wasn't a megastar every word he said 
wasn't dissected.

571
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,110
Did it seem like,
uh,

572
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,250
somebody asked him.
He's like,

573
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:49,510
yeah,
I probably did like,

574
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,490
Oh,
this mother fucker pizza gate,

575
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,750
you know,
it's like God damn,

576
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,580
I didn't vote.

577
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,480
Oh,
he didn't vote.

578
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,950
A No vote is a vote for trump.
He's not woke enough.

579
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,920
How has that damning?
He's fucking also,

580
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:15,754
by the way,
this interview took place when it was 

581
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:18,670
like 21.
He's 23 now.

582
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,180
Why political would make it a political 
standard.

583
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,230
Our votes don't count.
Malone

584
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,420
is a second amendment comment by the 
way.

585
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:29,710
They're just like,
watch this,

586
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,140
and then they go into.
He likes guns.

587
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:32,990
No,
really?

588
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,350
Yeah,
he likes guns.

589
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:36,184
You guys.

590
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,673
Hey.

591
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,950
Oh,
we got mentioned here.

592
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,800
Top comment.
Watching this h three video right now.

593
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,233
That's when people used to like us.
Those were the days a large collection 

594
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:50,804
of guns on the personal front.
He's friends with Justin Bieber and has 

595
00:30:53,391 --> 00:30:57,290
even opened for him on tour.
Did somebody say Justin Bieber?

596
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,430
He's Canadian.
Did you know that he.

597
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,630
The babies in the ass?
No.

598
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,620
No,
he does not do that.

599
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,113
But what?
What does that,

600
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,520
what does that like what,
what?

601
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,633
I don't know.
Somehow they're turning everything into 

602
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,610
like having a negative tone even though 
they're just saying like,

603
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,350
did you know that he's physical 
accomplishment.

604
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,230
He opened for Justin Bieber tour.
Exactly.

605
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,490
Showing him on Jimmy Fallon.
Like that's a problem.

606
00:31:25,491 --> 00:31:27,140
So you know,
that.

607
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,943
Did you know that he has tattoos on his 
face often associated with criminal 

608
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:36,934
gangs?

609
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,310
Was it true that like Justin Bieber 
talked you into getting a tattoo?

610
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,970
I figured because we were working on 
stony and then um,

611
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,690
we had a tattoo artist come through and 
then it was just like,

612
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:52,440
you know what,
Justin Bieber's got some tats and I love

613
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:54,450
you,
but I know I'm way tougher than you.

614
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,310
Why would they show that he's kidding?
He's obviously kidding.

615
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,383
But like what?
So what is living cut it off before the 

616
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:06,711
laughter of the audience.
I just don't understand.

617
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:08,674
So this is the video.
This is the kind of preface this toe 

618
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,710
that sets the tone.
It's like,

619
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,293
wow,

620
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,090
point with this video is entitled.
You think you know,

621
00:32:17,091 --> 00:32:20,030
but you have no idea.
So what did I learn?

622
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:21,680
He likes guns.
He didn't vote.

623
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,420
He's friends with Justin Bieber.
Wow,

624
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:25,760
let's send this guy to prison.
Okay,

625
00:32:25,761 --> 00:32:28,960
well now let's get on with this.
Weird to see such a,

626
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,620
like that's a hate base,
right?

627
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,593
As much as,
as much of a hippies as you can make 

628
00:32:35,031 --> 00:32:35,864
without being like so obvious about it 
because they constructed a way that 

629
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:44,080
people who are sympathetic to them don't
see happen.

630
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,780
Manipulate too.
So we see right through it.

631
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,120
Exactly.
But it's very normal.

632
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:51,270
Washington pulse,
obviously.

633
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,280
He's a liberal of liberal leaning paper 
and I'm like a reputable.

634
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,723
Oh Yeah,
Washington Post is like on par with New 

635
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,453

I mean just one of the most famous 

636
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,220
newspapers in the world actually owned 
by your boy,

637
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:05,054
Jeff Bezos by Amazon.
But this is the op Ed and this is not 

638
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,693
like.
I don't know,

639
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,150
it's probably got a lot of traction.
I wonder if has views or anything.

640
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,130
But um,
you know what?

641
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:18,380

There's a lot of debate about whether if
you sitting in front of video games and 

677
00:35:11,171 --> 00:35:12,004
computer screens can actually damage 
your eyes and I'm sad to say that 

678
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,853
research is starting to show that the 
blue light coming from screens can kill 

679
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:20,930
you.
No,

680
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:23,180
I'm kidding.
They did not necessarily will kill you,

681
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:26,150
but it can give you discomfort,
dry eyes,

682
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:26,984
blurry vision or headaches.
The discomfort is real from sitting in 

683
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:34,910
front of screens and now the technology 
exists that you can keep your eyes fresh

That field is gay.

693

Grasses are an easy fix.
Get pop them on.

694

They've got it all and here's the best 

745
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:39,304

That's why if you're a beginner or even

Once famously wrote,
um,

751
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,860
probably was him,
um,

752
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,960
other brokers charge up to $10 for every
trade,

753
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:04,210
but Robin Hood doesn't charge a fee.
Okay.

754
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,770
That adds up.

Thank you all for sticking around.

777
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,000
Back to the article.
I don't understand this.

778
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:27,310
They start off by saying Dallas,
him.

779
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,980
What does that mean?
Him Low

780
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,873
regardless.
The most popular young artists and the 

781
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:37,084
most unpopular young nation is a 
rhinestone cowboy who looks like he 

782
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:44,320
crawled out of the primordial swamp of 
Nacho cheese.

783
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,360
I'll hand that to them.
That's pretty funny.

784
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,410
But Post Malone well,
okay.

785
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:51,244
He's making fun.
He says he looks like he's a little 

786
00:40:52,521 --> 00:40:54,490
sticky.
People have said that a lot about them.

787
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,210
I can tell you he doesn't stink,
but regardless here it goes on.

788
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,420
This is when it gets mean.
Post Malone is a Halloween rental,

789
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,033
a removable platinum grill,
cubic zirconium proposal on the jumbo 

790
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:09,610
screen of a last place team.

791
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,130
I am getting mileage out of that.
A English degree right there.

792
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,820
No,
he's like that.

793
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,250
By the way that I mentioned.
I went to college,

794
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:22,890
uh,
his music,

795
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:25,920
one of the shallowest bastardization of 
rap to date.

796
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,160
And I do not say that lightly type 
ticket from Mr,

797
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,670
which was basically him saying,
I hate everybody.

798
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,130
White German for white.
Literally.

799
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:39,500
Jeff White.
Yes,

800
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:41,960
Dan.
He's an authority authority on rap,

801
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,570
on the rap music.
Your last name is a white dude.

802
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,360
Mind your own business.
Dan said that,

803
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:48,194
not me.
I don't care.

804
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:53,230
I don't see race as the creative tension
of associates at a down town.

805
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,370
Dude,
stop with the analogies.

806
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,873
Has the creative tension of associates 
at a downtown law firm complaining that 

807
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:01,790
a hundred and $50,000
a year just doesn't cut it?

808
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,190
What are you talking about?
Just getting to the point.

809
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,253
He looks like he clubbed over that.
It looks like it was clubbed over the 

810
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:12,890
head by a cartoon.
Peacock.

811
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,220
He just turned 23.
So poetic.

812
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,100
Alright dude.
This guy so bitter.

813
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,383
He's so you could,
you could taste is better and America 

814
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,970
just can't get enough.
And somehow in that sun insults that.

815
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:29,391
Well,
yeah,

816
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:30,224
because in his mind the only reason that
America get could like this guy who he 

817
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,650
who went to college and is so in tune 
with the hip hop and knows what's good.

818
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,420
The only reason the only way that 
America could,

819
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:49,160
could like him is if the world was just 
upside down.

820
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:51,440
Enough sense.
Kind of like Donald Trump did.

821
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:52,274
We mentioned possibly Nielsen recently 
named a the suburban Dallas raised 

822
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,920
rapper 2018 is the most popular 
musician,

823
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,933
so it was only a matter of time before 
malone had his own festival of 

824
00:43:03,891 --> 00:43:04,724
contemporary rite of passage for nearly 
every major pop rap star who has his 

825
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:12,230
face plastered across spotifies get 
turnt playlists.

826
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,510
I'm sure he's on other playlists than 
get turnt.

827
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:15,523
More like most popular songs.
How about that one asshole get termed 

828
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,393
the inauguration.
Post-Defense was held Sunday night in 

829
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,610
Dallas's Dos equis pavilion.
Watched it like,

830
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,150
oh,
and did it have to be on a beer?

831
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,550
And it was a less a festival than a 
behemoth.

832
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,190
What is sae a?
Do you know what that is?

833
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:38,024
Dan?
Rush mixer held on a few acres of 

834
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:40,754
corporate branded concrete.
Many festivals pride themselves on 

835
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:43,964
offering non musical diversity diversion
such as art installations or novelty 

836
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:50,540
culinary options.
That sounds awful.

837
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,300
There were none of that here though.
Just $5.

838
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:55,220
Jello shots.
That's exactly what I want.

839
00:43:55,221 --> 00:43:58,820
When I go to a show,
a novelty culinary option.

840
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,780
I think the essay is a reference to a 
Frat by the way,

841
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,510
so he's just saying like a.
it's like a frat party.

842
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,550
I think he's confusing a.
A concert with a farmer's market.

843
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,730
The shot,
the concerts that I usually go to remind

844
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:15,470
me of.
Calabasas farmer's market.

845
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,363
There were a little to separate.
There were a little separated from 

846
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:21,190
regular postal and concert.
Other than that,

847
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,040
the big name opening acts and true 
religion sponsored post Malone Bandanas,

848
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,180
featuring an extreme closeup of Austin 
post itself.

849
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:31,280
Glade squinting as ever.
What is wrong with having a festival?

850
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,250
That's him plus other big artists.
Is that the first festival?

851
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:36,283
You know,
it's not that easy to put together the 

852
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,690
crazy through that together.
So I know he was working on it a while.

853
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:44,623
I don't know what he's comparing it to,
but maybe in five years they would get 

854
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:47,964
crazier.
You know,

855
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,090
honestly,
compared to a Lollapalooza,

856
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,870
this thing sucks.
There was no novelty.

857
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:55,704
Arts and crafts stations.
This should have ostensively been a 

858
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:01,104
coordination is unequivocal.
Ascension to the a list pops 

859
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,090
superstardom of mano named visionaries 
do stop.

860
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:14,220
There are artists who dictate the Zeit 
geist and those who reflected possible.

861
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,063
One is to the ladder,
an Avatar of algorithm culture that 

862
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:21,560
rewards pleasant banality over the 
creative leap.

863
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,580
Vexing.
I need to.

864
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,170
Oh,
when I'm listening to music,

865
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:28,020
I want to be vexed.
I want to be confused,

866
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,270
or it's like you're trying to figure it 
out.

867
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,220
It's.
I mean,

868
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,050
this guy needs to be thinking all the 
time.

869
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,590
Sorry about my cough.
Guys.

870
00:45:40,591 --> 00:45:44,040
I'm still getting over this illness and 
his own festival in his hometown.

871
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:47,220
He had the opportunity to lucidly stayed
his mission and values.

872
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,083
Instead,
he revealed himself to be Jack Johnson 

873
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:52,910
of the Ada weights and nakedly grafted 
hip hop.

874
00:45:52,911 --> 00:45:54,690
So I love that.
He's like running for office.

875
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,780
Okay guys,
here's what I believe I read.

876
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,800
He's like,
he didn't reject trump.

877
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,970
And tell everybody to vote,
you know what I mean?

878
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,770
That's kind of what he's saying.
Right.

879
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,400
He had the opportunity to state his 
mission and values.

880
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,770
Like I feel like that's what he's 
saying.

881
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:14,743
He's like,
unlike Jay Z and beyonce who say they 

882
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:19,830
hate trump and urge everyone to vote.
He didn't actually want to say that,

883
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,313
but that you know what the thing is.
That is kind of why he's popping and 

884
00:46:25,641 --> 00:46:26,474
I'll tell you why because young kids,
they may already have their mind up and 

885
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:31,584
then maybe politically motivated,
but this article is part of the problem 

886
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:37,260
in that it politicizes everything.

887
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,530
And Post Malone is decidedly 
unpolitical.

888
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:45,531
He said even two years ago,
he doesn't vote and he's a young guy.

889
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:46,590
Okay.
First of all,

890
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,630
but like you,
it's nice.

891
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,073
It is nice to separate politics from 
some fucking thing because it's 

892
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:58,050
literally everywhere.
You know what I mean?

893
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,033
You don't need to be preached to all the
effing time and is doing it as a 

894
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:08,580
decision.
That's what he,

895
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,253
that's what he wants and like it because
he's trying to have fun because the 

896
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:16,350
point is that he's trying to have fun 
and that's his personality.

897
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:20,460
When you hung out with him and you know 
you don't have a political conversation.

898
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,710
Well this is just.
Yeah,

899
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,810
but Isla,
you basically today,

900
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:25,644
right now on this live podcast,
have the opportunity to lucidly state 

901
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:29,620
your mission and values.
Right?

902
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:30,260
So

903
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:35,050
what do you believe in Isla?
Or are you just a naked,

904
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:38,170
grifting hip hop slang,
slang,

905
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,630
slang by 9:30
PM,

906
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,750
chance of posting,
filled the APP amphitheater,

907
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,350
15 year old blonde girls in days.
Daisy do that.

908
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,203
This guy wasn't there the whole time.
I guess he was there every minute like 

909
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,200
these,
you know,

910
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,210
these youtubers that could jake,
Paul Kohn,

911
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:55,863
although those guys,
or at least having fun kind of in a way 

912
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,070
this guy's like back there with a 
notepad.

913
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:03,490
Let's look at all these young kids 
having a good time.

914
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,990
He didn't even state his values.
He didn't even give us his mission,

915
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:09,250
state markers,
values.

916
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,410
He didn't even tell me to vote.
Postman did not want to tell me to vote,

917
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,093
you know,
fucking asshole who was this guy has no 

918
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:23,250
friends by the way.

919
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,130
Maybe he does,
but they're all like,

920
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,670
I have a feeling when they're,
they have dinner parties and for dessert

921
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:31,504
they'll lay in a circle,
knows to ask and Fart in each other's 

922
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:36,670
face.
It's like a snake.

923
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,541
Like,
okay,

924
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,610
you guys ready for dessert?
Let's all get in a circle.

925
00:48:39,611 --> 00:48:41,410
And then you put your nose right in 
your,

926
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,533
uh,
your partners asked and then you fall 

927
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,063
dinner back in each other's face because
they liked the smell of their own farts 

928
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:51,070
as the joke.
Arrogant.

929
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:56,130
It was just what I'm trying to say.
I'm by 9:30

930
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:58,060
chance of posts he filled the 
amphitheatre,

931
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:02,680
15 year old blonde girls and daisy dukes
and champagnes and blunts shirts,

932
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:03,514
shrieked as if postpone.
We're next to the lineage of backstreet 

933
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:08,920
boys.
Girls that I wanted to fuck,

934
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:11,080
but sadly will never have the 
opportunity,

935
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,083
the Jonas brothers or one direction.
The main difference this time is that 

936
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:20,380
they honored their hero with matching 
temporary face tattoos,

937
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:24,160
barbed wire on the forehead,
a knife like crucifix.

938
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,160
On the cheek and his trademark phrase 
inked and cursive.

939
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:32,161
Stay away and rest.
Easy temporary faced.

940
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,333
Yeah.
I know a bunch of gang members with 

941
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,400
their rose in Troy Aiken,
jerseys and beer bong,

942
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:40,630
Bentley.
March,

943
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:45,580
a merge grunted with Siemian Glee.
1,000

944
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:48,850
people rocketed up,
stood on their seats for a brief moment.

945
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:49,684
There was palatable fear of being 
stampeded the death at postmortem 

946
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:57,100
concert,
which of course requires the deceased to

947
00:49:57,101 --> 00:49:57,934
be buried in a racecar shaped coffin 
wrapped in the rockstar energy drink 

948
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:03,880
logo to it.
Are you trying to be funny?

949
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,320
Three M and m's song served as his 
intro.

950
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,101
Oh,
I love that.

951
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:13,300
They make this about race watch,
presumably a tested nod to his fandom,

952
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,373
but also a heavy handed reminder that 
postman was the most popular white guy 

953
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:21,601
and hip hop since Marshall mathers.
Who the fuck criticizes a m and m at the

954
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:23,554
moment when the hysteria seemed in 
danger of laney posts took the stage to 

955
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:28,364
definitely tears.
Scorching jet flames and billowing 

956
00:50:31,671 --> 00:50:36,671
clouds of smoke like a groupon version 
of a kiss concert in 1975.

957
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,470
A group on version.
First of all roof.

958
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,600
There's no group on version you when you
get groupon,

959
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:46,930
you go so you can get a discount.
You get a disk,

960
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,670
you see kiss.
Your analogies are all twisted.

961
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,504
Buddy.
You should have said a dollar store 

962
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:57,740
version because group on gets you into 
the show.

963
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,240
That was a weird one.
You know what?

964
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,103
Get me.
Maybe you need to go back and finish 

965
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,410
your degree.
Big Shot.

966
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,650
Groupon version,
sipping from a Red Solo Cup.

967
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:14,360
He soon began slurring too young.
He's like,

968
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:16,700
he's not.
He makes it sound like he's so drunk.

969
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:17,534
He can't say anything to talk about.
Now with a voice like bong water 

970
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:27,641
bubbling and the casual misogyny of a 
member of a red pill subreddit.

971
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,350
What the fuck?
Come on.

972
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,913
So here you go.
A direct connection to like some 

973
00:51:33,411 --> 00:51:35,720
outright red pilling.
It's like,

974
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:37,190
dude,
that's in your mind.

975
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:38,210
That's not what's there.

976
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,620
I actually can't read it because he 
believed everything out.

977
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,620
My whip fast,
my bitch bad.

978
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,800
I guess I skirt,
skirt that coop fast.

979
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,600
My coop fast.
Your bitch.

980
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:54,020
No,
my bitch slow should do what I say so.

981
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:54,913
And she always keeps me on my toes.
Those lines are as good as any 

982
00:51:58,461 --> 00:52:02,330
representing weapon alone is working on 
a lyrical level will have to say if he's

983
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:07,331
picking out the most misogynistic stick,
red pilled Eric's lyrics,

984
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:09,464
that ain't,
that's not that persuasive because 

985
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:16,160
that's gonna be a real task to start 
looking at lyrics.

986
00:52:16,161 --> 00:52:19,410
So hip hop.
Yeah,

987
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,353
I mean,
and the truth that like Kendrick Lamar 

988
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,593
who is applauded by all has a great line
and from his new album where he says 

989
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:31,030
he's fears being judged by his,
um,

990
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,100
his most baselines.
You know,

991
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,190
and if this is the best you could find 
through this,

992
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,033
not,
that's really not convincing me that 

993
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:43,470
he's a red pill subreddit,
you know,

994
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,673
on recordings,
his falsetto is afforded a modest four 

995
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:49,244
cylinder strength,
but on stage it comes off slurred and 

996
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:53,860
sloppy.
Switching like roadkill,

997
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:55,730
twitching,
twitching,

998
00:52:55,731 --> 00:52:57,260
like roadkill,
limp off.

999
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:58,094
Key notes underscored by a booming 
backing track that operated like a life 

1000
00:53:02,361 --> 00:53:06,410
preserver.
I'm going to get amped up tonight.

1001
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,710
Who was left up tonight if I forget the 
words because I'm too drunk,

1002
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:10,544
helped me sing along.
He told the crowd is the same applause 

1003
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:13,724
line that he used at Coachella is entire
set list was essentially identical to 

1004
00:53:16,881 --> 00:53:18,830
what he played at every festival all 
summer long.

1005
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,990
Right down to the mono Cylo syllabic 
curse laden between song,

1006
00:53:23,991 --> 00:53:26,250
babbling about haters,
the importance of

1007
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,710
rocky raking out.
That's what caught.

1008
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,690
That's what's called a set.
Pretty normal.

1009
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:32,030
Yeah.
That's why it's called a set.

1010
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:34,463
If you're like,
he's been doing the same thing for 10 

1011
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:37,470
years.
That might be interesting.

1012
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,140
He's been doing the same thing all 
summer.

1013
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:45,060
It's called a set.
He tours a lot.

1014
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:46,320
You've got to know.
You know,

1015
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:47,154
you got to set.
You guys hear that the rolling stones 

1016
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:54,210
played painted black at their concert.
I love that.

1017
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,490
Post Malone dare to come out with a set.
When I go to festivals,

1018
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:01,080
after I'm done with my arts and crafts 
booth,

1019
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:04,440
I like to enjoy spoken word.
It's different every time it's performed

1020
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:10,320
as if as if the people coming to a show 
don't want to hear the fricken classics,

1021
00:54:10,321 --> 00:54:12,270
and by the way,
that guy has two albums.

1022
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,990
It's all there.
You know what I mean?

1023
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,200
Even if it's voice barely slithered 
passed the 10th road.

1024
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,510
It doesn't matter if fans who knew every
word,

1025
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,180
they were there to commune to songs such
as better now,

1026
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:26,430
his latest anthem and interchangeable 
heartbreak,

1027
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:31,610
presumably made for streaming at that Wa
who's fished up those kiosk and lax

1028
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,033
wet.

1029
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,553
Uh,
the problem isn't necessarily that it's 

1030
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:42,180
crass,
but that it's meaningless.

1031
00:54:42,181 --> 00:54:44,220
I thought he was crashed.
I thought it was a red pillar.

1032
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,460
It's not that it's stupid,
but it's vacant.

1033
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,690
It's the losing difference between 
appropriation and outright theft.

1034
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:52,733
Woo.
So there he's actually accusing him not 

1035
00:54:55,831 --> 00:54:56,664
just of a cultural appropriation,
which is a high charge enough but 

1036
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:04,670
outright theft.
And by the way,

1037
00:55:05,341 --> 00:55:08,140
this music is only fit for streaming at 
Wa.

1038
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,053
Who's fish taco kiosk at lax?
Did he get a kickback from the Taco 

1039
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:14,423
Kiosk?
Does see this guy is involved in big 

1040
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,510
fish taco kiosk money,

1041
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,023
by the way.
I know this article upset him too 

1042
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,780
because he tweeted out,
fuck you.

1043
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:27,003
The same day it came out,
which I presume was in response to this 

1044
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:34,840
article because you know,
it's like,

1045
00:55:34,841 --> 00:55:39,520
dude,
he's not trying to be anything.

1046
00:55:39,521 --> 00:55:42,370
He's not.
He's not trying to be,

1047
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:46,210
he's not being a fraud,
he's not being,

1048
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,100
you know,
he's being authentic,

1049
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,310
so if you don't like it,
I understand it's not for everybody,

1050
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,940
but it seems to bother you that 
everybody seems to like about you,

1051
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,163
but you have to make it seem like it's 
the fabric that's tearing our country 

1052
00:55:59,951 --> 00:56:00,784
apart and it's really not.
I personally find articles like this to 

1053
00:56:03,311 --> 00:56:07,720
be more damaging than anything possible.
Loves doing it.

1054
00:56:07,721 --> 00:56:09,190
It's not his fault.
He's popular.

1055
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,650
He's doing what he's always done.
He's making music.

1056
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:12,484
He likes people,
liked him and they attached to him and 

1057
00:56:15,311 --> 00:56:16,270
they like what he's doing.

1058
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:19,960
It's not his fault.
He's popular posts.

1059
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,040
It's like,
okay.

1060
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:22,803
He didn't cheat his way.
The top yard in Postville as music is 

1061
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:29,350
dead eyed in ignorant,
astonishing Dole and it's materialism,

1062
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:30,184
abandoned an abandoned lot of creativity
with absolutely no evidence of traffic 

1063
00:56:34,031 --> 00:56:37,420
and it's cerebral cortex who you are so 
smart.

1064
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,840
You are so smart,
and there's also a negative side.

1065
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,310
Wait,
wait,

1066
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:45,910
this was all good.
Even if it's intention is sincere.

1067
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,470
Homage,
the blood during wet.

1068
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,700
What lists limit imitation can't help 
but feel like minstrelsy good verbiage,

1069
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,020
verbiage here,
wait for like a minstrel show,

1070
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:05,840
like face kind of thing,
right?

1071
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,373
While people will inevitably appropriate
the most culturally relevant music 

1072
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:13,900
genre,
one that's becoming almost interlink,

1073
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:17,380
intrinsically bound to the modern 
conception of pop,

1074
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:22,030
but it's not asking too much to attempt 
modest synthesis or the incorporation of

1075
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:22,864
a single new idea,
or at least to not be so grotesquely 

1076
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,733
desolate.
We went from eminem to Cheddar Bob 

1077
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,060
[inaudible].
Shout out to Cheddar Bob.

1078
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,420
If posted one were black,
he wouldn't have sold half.

1079
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,980
He simply wouldn't exist.

1080
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:42,550
There you have it right here from Bob 
Weiss.

1081
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,630
More and more we don't read the thing 
and you get the idea,

1082
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:50,170
but I just think it's just,
you know,

1083
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:52,870
it's a little dramatic.
What's most,

1084
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,093
what's most damning?
This post Malone's bloodless abyss of 

1085
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:58,354
soul and funk.
How do you have a bloodless attempts at 

1086
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:04,650
being emotional feel like hallow 
gestures?

1087
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:09,490
It goes on and on.
I'm president at a bullseye on his head.

1088
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:16,030
You could go to right here,
plus most problem Postville.

1089
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:21,580
His problem is that he isn't a bad 
person or even completely untalented.

1090
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,530
Thank you.
Thanks a little towns lists.

1091
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,510
I'll,
I'll admit this,

1092
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:28,310
you're not completely on talented.
Um,

1093
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:33,650
it steady stands for nothing at all.
I think almost in a way could for him,

1094
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,493
you know,
because music doesn't need to be 

1095
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:42,460
political.
Not everything needs to be political.

1096
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:45,580
He's an entertainer that's supposed to 
be an escape.

1097
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:47,283
He can afford to feign the swagger and 
cool and hip hop when it's convenient 

1098
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,560
and opt out when it's time to see who's 
writing for the cars.

1099
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,600
It's always been a fairly 
straightforward compact when it comes to

1100
00:58:58,601 --> 00:58:59,434
hip hop.
If you're a white person eating off of 

1101
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:02,560
what has historically been black 
culture,

1102
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,170
you have a certain obligation to repay 
that creative debt.

1103
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,740
Eminem continues to attack.
The hypocrisy is and contradictions that

1104
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:11,830
allowed him to leap frog equally gifted 
artists.

1105
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:13,563
That's a strong statement.
Macklowe or may have lex subtlety or 

1106
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:20,020
rudimentary understanding of when to 
share text messages,

1107
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,010
but there are no questioning.

1108
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,500
His dedication to confronting his white 
privilege.

1109
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:29,710
Even g eazy repeat,
even g eazy dropped out of that racist h

1110
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:33,620
and m advertising campaigns.
So here you have it,

1111
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
you know,
one more.

1112
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:37,370
Can you say,
um,

1113
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,220
yeah.
Post Malone so perfectly represents,

1114
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,810
is idiotic currents that have carried us
into this present cultural submersion.

1115
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:51,740
We're an objective notion of the truth 
has been systematically muddied.

1116
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,070
Come what?
That's not a stretch.

1117
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,210
Come on.
Trump lies,

1118
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:57,980
therefore,
post Malone as popular.

1119
00:59:58,770 --> 00:59:59,603
Damn facts aren't negotiable and any 
hint of criticism and be it for lacking 

1120
01:00:02,661 --> 01:00:03,494
integrity,
dignity or talent can be brazenly 

1121
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:07,760
dismissed as the pitiful cries of 
haters.

1122
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:10,340
So congratulations.
I guess who allowed this to happen?

1123
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,130
What a whole new system allowed this 
grease.

1124
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:14,910
Discarded.
Barbecue,

1125
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:19,911
a wrapper to prosper if fake Pale king 
sitting on a tin foil thrown returned to

1126
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:23,120
sender.
Oh my God,

1127
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,650
you're so bitter.

1128
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:26,870
Dude.
I love how bitter you are.

1129
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:33,010
Who allowed this guy to write pitchfork?
He's like a,

1130
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,070
here's my English degree.
And um,

1131
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:36,163
here's a list of all the.
I couldn't believe how many it was when 

1132
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:42,080
I was reading it.
Like that's what articles are.

1133
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:44,060
I feel like there's,
you know,

1134
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,390
I feel like there's a point to be made 
here,

1135
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:49,183
I'm not agreeing with it,
but I understand if somebody wants to 

1136
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:53,910
make a point,
but,

1137
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:54,883
but,
but to be so mean and better to comment 

1138
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,730
made it into an Arctic.
Right.

1139
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:02,390
It's like an elegant youtube comment.
Um,

1140
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,610
you could make the point that like pop 
music is vacuum,

1141
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:08,100
but one,
you wouldn't be the first person to make

1142
01:01:08,101 --> 01:01:10,290
that point by a long shot.
And two,

1143
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,750
it's not like he's even like the biggest
example of that.

1144
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,050
I mean,
you know,

1145
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:15,203
he's competing like he compared us to a 
post unfavorably to one direction and 

1146
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:21,830
like backstreet boys,
it's like,

1147
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:25,500
that was just as vacuum.
Like their lyrics aren't fucking deep.

1148
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:26,700
What the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah,

1149
01:01:26,701 --> 01:01:26,780
hit

1150
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,150
me baby.
One more.

1151
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,041
You know,
it's the same.

1152
01:01:30,041 --> 01:01:32,330
Even write the music.
They were like fucking fully.

1153
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,460
At least he's a songwriter.
Exactly.

1154
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:37,250
I'll admit he has some.
He's not without talent.

1155
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,280
I don't know.
The guy is just a dick.

1156
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,000
He just seems like it.
And people who don't know anything about

1157
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:45,590
him read this and.
But you know what,

1158
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:46,370
that's,
that's,

1159
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:51,370
that's part of the game.
The bigger you get as part of the game.

1160
01:01:52,461 --> 01:01:56,210
But the good news for Post Malone is 
that he's got a lot of love and a lot of

1161
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:57,044
fans.
And it's funny you say that because if 

1162
01:01:58,731 --> 01:02:03,230
you compare him to his contemporaries 
and my opinion has music is a cut above.

1163
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:05,120
It is more,
it's nicer,

1164
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,490
it's better I think.
Yeah,

1165
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:10,370
whenever we put like a random playlist 
of like top top hits or whatever,

1166
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:13,130
well I can't stand most of them.

1167
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:13,941
Yeah,
I agree.

1168
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:15,470
I mean,
and again he,

1169
01:02:15,471 --> 01:02:16,304
he,
he makes it seem like he owes a debt to 

1170
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:18,853
hip hop.
And again that's a whole theoretical 

1171
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:21,901
debate.
I don't know.

1172
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:24,000
But what if you're going to talk about 
that?

1173
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:26,070
His genre is not.
Exactly.

1174
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:29,130
Exactly.
He's not really a wrap merge of.

1175
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,040
He doesn't.
What actually he does it wrap.

1176
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,353
He doesn't wrap.
He said even in the video they say his 

1177
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:36,240
biggest inspirations.
Bob Dylan.

1178
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:38,843
I mean he's closer to rock and roll.
Then he was like hip hop or rap or like 

1179
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,420
rnb maybe.
I don't know,

1180
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,250
but he doesn't know.
Anyway,

1181
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,380
whatever.
So there you go.

1182
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,690
I read that and I was like,
damn,

1183
01:02:51,691 --> 01:02:56,490
this is a dick and he's wrong.
And the thing is,

1184
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:57,324
he's,
he's so desperate to make it political 

1185
01:02:59,160 --> 01:02:59,993
because most of them doesn't.
He's just not a political guy and they 

1186
01:03:03,451 --> 01:03:04,320
hate that.

1187
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,190
So if anything,
you're the problem buddy.

1188
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,510
Musicians are political.
I mean there's a lot,

1189
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,170
a lot art mean a lot aren't.
A lot of them are a political,

1190
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:17,460
a lot of them just want to stay out of 
it.

1191
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:18,323
Well the problem is that he's posed with
guns screw spooky and he's from Texas 

1192
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,740
extra spooky.
So like,

1193
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:29,580
um,
a lot do speak,

1194
01:03:29,581 --> 01:03:31,230
but as part of this whole,
you know,

1195
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:36,240
it's so obnoxious man,
like let people be a political.

1196
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:40,680
He can be a problem with that.
Just let him be like,

1197
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:43,050
you don't have to drag everybody into 
the fight.

1198
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,170
If he doesn't care about politics,
does it have to force it?

1199
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,160
Like,
I don't know.

1200
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:50,490
And he's a young guy too,
like he's focused on music.

1201
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:55,491
He's not reading about maybe later in 
his life maybe he wasn't exactly.

1202
01:03:56,701 --> 01:03:58,320
No one needs to force it.
And like,

1203
01:03:58,321 --> 01:04:00,960
he likes guns,
like again,

1204
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,710
you can be on either side of the 
spectrum and be pro.

1205
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:08,850
That doesn't mean he's not in favor of 
sensible gun laws.

1206
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:12,170
I don't know what his political stance 
on that is one way or another,

1207
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:16,770
but it's like let some,
let people be unpolitical.

1208
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,290
Maybe he votes and maybe he cares about 
politics,

1209
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:20,910
but like,
just fuck.

1210
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Just the people that listened to him 
want to chill anyway.

1211
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:31,350
Spoke enough about that.
Love only love to my boy posts alum.

1212
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:35,340
Um,
and it doesn't smell.

1213
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,740
He doesn't understand.
For the record,

1214
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:40,410
he does not stink.
I want to clear that up.

1215
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,200
Let's clear the air.
Smells good?

1216
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,300
Well,
I haven't smelled him.

1217
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,640
There's no smell.
There's no suits.

1218
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:52,860
Neck and took.
I took a big old stacks.

1219
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,741
It was good.
Yeah.

1220
01:04:53,741 --> 01:04:56,100
Dance.
He hasn't washed his nose since.

1221
01:04:56,690 --> 01:05:00,510
I'm all right Ron.
So guys,

1222
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:05,820
it's time to play.
Know your meme.

1223
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:10,850
That's right.
The biggest game on in the world.

1224
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,670
The biggest game in the world.
Hands down.

1225
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,123
No.
Me.

1226
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:23,800
Yes.
Today's guest is legendary.

1227
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:27,190
Run for the cube.
We've got him.

1228
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:28,473
He's recorded eight different phrases 
for our lucky color and they have to 

1229
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,830
guess what he said.
Okay.

1230
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:38,990
They got to get five out of the eight.
Correct.

1231
01:05:38,991 --> 01:05:43,991
To win a brand new Samsung Galaxy s nine
plus or retail value of a $1,000

1232
01:05:46,451 --> 01:05:49,600
for our lucky color.
So let's get started.

1233
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,860
Here we go.
We've got chancellor on the line.

1234
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:55,120
Chancellor,
are you there?

1235
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,260
Hello?
You're on the air.

1236
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:58,501
Oh yeah,
I'm here.

1237
01:05:58,501 --> 01:05:59,334
How's it going?
And chancellor or you feel unlucky 

1238
01:06:01,411 --> 01:06:03,780
today.
Are you familiar with run the cube?

1239
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,890
Run for the cube?
Yeah,

1240
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,180
I'm feeling lucky.
BMP.

1241
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:10,350
Yes.
Chance store.

1242
01:06:10,351 --> 01:06:12,900
I love to hear.
Now tell me about yourself.

1243
01:06:12,901 --> 01:06:15,720
Where are you calling from?
Well,

1244
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:17,340
I'm in Tyler,
Texas.

1245
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:19,240
All right.
And do you think uh,

1246
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:21,760
you know what,
I was going to make a post malone thing,

1247
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:24,280
but let's not get political here.
Uh,

1248
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,430
I liked posty going.
Yeah.

1249
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,560
No,
I like both,

1250
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:31,050
but I think I just talked about it for 
like four years now.

1251
01:06:31,051 --> 01:06:33,020
Tell me,
tell me,

1252
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:36,570
have you watched a lot of run for the 
cube videos?

1253
01:06:36,571 --> 01:06:38,880
Are familiar with his style,
his delivery?

1254
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,233
Well,
without you guys was video like four 

1255
01:06:42,861 --> 01:06:44,660
years ago.
I would never have known about him,

1256
01:06:44,661 --> 01:06:49,661
but I've seen a little bit of him,
but let me actually in our audience with

1257
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:53,060
run for the cube really fast,
for those who aren't.

1258
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,890
Oh Wow.
This one is 13 million views,

1259
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:59,720
so he only shows around.
That's right.

1260
01:06:59,721 --> 01:07:00,554
That's his classic.
He only shows his hands green surgical 

1261
01:07:03,471 --> 01:07:04,304
gloves and he takes a scalpel and 
tweezers and dissects them as if they 

1262
01:07:09,201 --> 01:07:10,034
were living creatures and the cadence of
his voice in the case that he has some 

1263
01:07:14,421 --> 01:07:15,680
sadistic pleasure in it.

1264
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,720
Let's see if nice to have a g line.
P like rat glue.

1265
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,960
My Kanye love.
He's just a strong.

1266
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:40,370
He's obsessed with eyeballs.
Be Brain surgery,

1267
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:46,510
so there you have it.
That is

1268
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,230
run for the cube.
As I said,

1269
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:54,150
run from the cube was more more accurate
in some cases,

1270
01:07:54,151 --> 01:07:57,090
but with that being said,
chancellor,

1271
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:00,850
are you ready to play?
Yes,

1272
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:02,080
I'm ready.
All right.

1273
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:04,990
Hit me with the tension.
Let's start from the top.

1274
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,960
What is he saying?
Here we go.

1275
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:10,650
Are you.
Are you.

1276
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:14,360
Are you doing for your mind?
Are you Chris?

1277
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,290
That's there.
What did you hear?

1278
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:28,310
Do I have options or what do you think?
I'll play it one more time on options.

1279
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,870
The thing is if I give you multiple 
choice,

1280
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,590
that will be too obvious.
The guy speak in English.

1281
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:38,260
Just got a chance.
Chancellor.

1282
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:39,710
I'm going to play for you one more time.
Okay?

1283
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,090
Okay.
Here we go.

1284
01:08:42,091 --> 01:08:42,924
Listen closely.

1285
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,220
Are you?
Are you.

1286
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,360
Are you doing for your mind?
Are you

1287
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:53,910
good?
All right.

1288
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:58,210
What did you hear?
Chancellor charge gibberish.

1289
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:05,250
I thought he said something about are 
you crying at the beginning?

1290
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:09,450
I'll give you a hint.
Colby person is your hint.

1291
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,710
Oh,
are you crazy?

1292
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:16,670
Are you coming on the board?
Strong.

1293
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,860
Great.
Pleasure that.

1294
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:20,170
Hey.
Hey.

1295
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:22,550
Hey.
Come on in this together.

1296
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:23,980
Okay.
We got to navigate this guy.

1297
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:26,600
Now let's move it on to round two.
Are you ready?

1298
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,020
I'm ready as I'll ever be.
All right.

1299
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:30,980
Here we go.
Chancellor,

1300
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:38,830
for us newbies don't view where we keep 
it out of you.

1301
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,090
Yes.
Yes,

1302
01:09:46,091 --> 01:09:46,924
yes.
Yes.

1303
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:51,250
What did you here?
Can I get it one more time?

1304
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:56,290
Why did you make out any words?
Any words?

1305
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:04,410
I think I heard Ethan in there.
Here.

1306
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,190
I'll give you a hand.
Michelle Obama.

1307
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:12,150
Yeah.
Wow.

1308
01:10:12,151 --> 01:10:13,260
Ethan.
Great moves.

1309
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,610
Let's play it one more time.
You want to play it again?

1310
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,110
Yeah,
I know that he knows.

1311
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:24,310
Well you asked me will be key page view

1312
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:26,900
because I,
I,

1313
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:31,060
I see it written so maybe I know,
maybe it,

1314
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:31,933
maybe it's not yellow.
It's one of those optical illusions 

1315
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:39,450
where and when you hear like the one 
that was 70 anyways.

1316
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,840
Well here we go because I thought those 
two were going to be easy.

1317
01:10:42,841 --> 01:10:45,620
And this one,
this is the one that I thought that was.

1318
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,690
That was the start with the freebies.
All right,

1319
01:10:48,691 --> 01:10:51,360
well you know you only need to get three
more,

1320
01:10:51,361 --> 01:10:53,520
right?
So you've got all the chances and.

1321
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,260
Okay.
Here we go.

1322
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,370
Theory.
I,

1323
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:58,011
Mike,
Iraqi,

1324
01:10:58,011 --> 01:10:59,550
rocky.
Just for you.

1325
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:06,560
Just by you.

1326
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,710
What do you got?
I'm here.

1327
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,310
I'm here in my garage.
Just bought my new Lamborghini.

1328
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:19,730
It.

1329
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,520
You're understanding you're entering the
cube,

1330
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:29,520
getting put on your shirt.
You guys,

1331
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:34,590
all of us still we love,
we love run for the cube and get.

1332
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:38,350
I hope you have a green surgical gloves 
on and your scalp already because we are

1333
01:11:38,351 --> 01:11:41,050
moving on.
Here we go.

1334
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:46,850
I love the company.

1335
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,360
That's a tough thing.
Is it?

1336
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:57,800
Can I get it one more time or drink or 
something?

1337
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:59,960
I think I might have something but.
Well,

1338
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:02,790
what are you thinking?
Well,

1339
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:05,940
I heard I lie or I love it.
I like it.

1340
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:11,470
And where does that lead you?
There was more.

1341
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,570
I thought that's all.
He said.

1342
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,650
Three words.
Okay.

1343
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,420
Zap You with it one more time.

1344
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:19,653
Me.

1345
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,530
There you go.
Three words.

1346
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:28,380
I love words.
I love.

1347
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:32,890
Time is running out tension.
There's no hint.

1348
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:34,660
Uh,
I love.

1349
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:39,210
I gave you two of the three words that 
is a hint here.

1350
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:42,930
We call related to videos we've made.
Yes.

1351
01:12:42,931 --> 01:12:43,940
So I'll relate it to you.

1352
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:46,370
What time call me?

1353
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:53,990
I think this is,
I think where we're at a time.

1354
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:58,430
Do you have a final answer?
Oh,

1355
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:59,810
I love memes.
That's all I got.

1356
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:04,460
So the real answer was I loved big 
connect made famous by.

1357
01:13:04,461 --> 01:13:09,461
Of course.
That's okay.

1358
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:17,090
Your three out of four,
which is very good.

1359
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,690
That's an excellent record.
Um,

1360
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:22,970
here we go,
this one is going to be tough.

1361
01:13:22,971 --> 01:13:23,804
So listen closely as if you are 
performing surgery on a road and 

1362
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,500
eyeballs and clarity and focus.
So here we go.

1363
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:38,240
I wipe from.
Yep.

1364
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:43,933
Wow.
He thought he was more like you than 

1365
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:46,143
that.
I'm watching,

1366
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:53,660
right?
Of

1367
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:54,493
course he is a,
as all good men are taken from the 

1368
01:13:57,781 --> 01:13:58,740
front.
That is right.

1369
01:13:58,770 --> 01:13:59,603
It's incorrect.
You want to live for the balls and 

1370
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:02,543
performance?
Scooping motion as discussed at great 

1371
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:07,590
length with those gloves?
Yes.

1372
01:14:07,591 --> 01:14:11,380
With the green glow.
So what are we at right now?

1373
01:14:11,381 --> 01:14:14,400
I believe it's four to one.
You need one more?

1374
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,341
One more.
All right.

1375
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:17,050
I got to tell you because there's,
there's,

1376
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:21,840
there's three more.
So a lot of chances.

1377
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,510
We got a lot of chances here.
Sorry.

1378
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:26,060
Don't fuck this up.
Here we go.

1379
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,630
What are you looking forward to?
Getting a new Samsung.

1380
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:30,464
Do you need the phone?

1381
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,270
Yeah,
Kinda.

1382
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,253
Uh,
I dropped mine and cracked it up pretty 

1383
01:14:35,731 --> 01:14:36,960
bad recently.
Yeah,

1384
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:37,401
yeah,
yeah,

1385
01:14:37,401 --> 01:14:38,730
yeah.
Is it a iphone?

1386
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:42,990
I know it's a note eight.
So you're in the club,

1387
01:14:42,991 --> 01:14:45,680
so you're already in the Samsung Gang.
But it's A.

1388
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:47,260
Yeah.
Well good.

1389
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:48,031
Are you.
We're gonna.

1390
01:14:48,031 --> 01:14:51,150
Get rid of that.
Hopefully you got three chances left.

1391
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:52,043
Hopefully.
Yeah,

1392
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:52,980
we're gonna.
We're gonna.

1393
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:55,200
Lock this down as,
as record.

1394
01:14:55,201 --> 01:15:00,060
I will say in your favor.
Nobody has ever lost around them.

1395
01:15:00,061 --> 01:15:00,894
No,
you're me.

1396
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:05,030
It's totally not designed at all.
Right.

1397
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,480
Here we go.
Hey,

1398
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:09,050
can you guys sign the phone if I do?
Um,

1399
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,020
yeah.
Yeah.

1400
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:15,020
Just write on the glass.
I'll sign off on it or on it.

1401
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,070
Whatever you want to give you some 
germs.

1402
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,930
Yell.
I'll use a sharpie and cover that.

1403
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:20,860
That'd be great.
Alright,

1404
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:22,810
here we go.
Well,

1405
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:25,980
don't be counting your eggs yet.
I know,

1406
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:27,110
I know.
I'm getting hooked up.

1407
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,910
Be counting your gummy worms yet,
right?

1408
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:34,400
You can use.

1409
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:40,770
I wasn't looking at the words and I have
no fucking idea what he said.

1410
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:44,130
Play it again.
Okay.

1411
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,500
Please.
Until you can use to landline veto you.

1412
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,760
Please tell me.
Do you have an idea?

1413
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:56,290
Yeah.
This donut is slamming doors.

1414
01:15:56,450 --> 01:16:01,450
Wow.
Not only you are a winner.

1415
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,593
Um,
you have completed the challenge 

1416
01:16:07,031 --> 01:16:07,864
chancellor.
How does it feel to be the owner of a 

1417
01:16:09,201 --> 01:16:13,810
brand new Samsung Galaxy s seven plus?
It feels good.

1418
01:16:13,811 --> 01:16:15,640
Honestly,
if I would've lost,

1419
01:16:15,641 --> 01:16:17,890
I still would have been happy to just 
talk to you guys.

1420
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,880
So you find what a sweetheart.
I love you for that.

1421
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:24,880
I kind of want to continue.
We have um,

1422
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,060
so we played the last two.
I've got a lot here.

1423
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:29,070
Yes.
By all means here.

1424
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:29,973
Let's go.
These are the bonus rounds if you don't 

1425
01:16:31,781 --> 01:16:33,660
get all right.
So again,

1426
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,520
you'll get merged.
Oh,

1427
01:16:36,521 --> 01:16:38,500
that's a good idea.
Oh,

1428
01:16:38,501 --> 01:16:43,501
this round you get that's or a or 
whatever you do you prefer?

1429
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:44,383
Yeah.

1430
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:45,470
Okay.

1431
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:46,410
Uh,
uh,

1432
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,320
really it's just either one.
Okay.

1433
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:51,150
So here we go.
For every one you get correct.

1434
01:16:51,151 --> 01:16:52,980
From here you get something,
you get another item.

1435
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:54,930
Are you fucking go?
Okay,

1436
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:56,120
here we go.
No,

1437
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:57,760
it's okay.
This is,

1438
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:00,360
this is,
this is it.

1439
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:01,343
Okay,
here we go.

1440
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:09,170
We'll see you.
See,

1441
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,450
we'll get them ready.

1442
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:20,650
Papa cancer,
the best man

1443
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:25,380
clip of millionaire,
the first guy.

1444
01:17:25,381 --> 01:17:26,730
That one,
who wants to be a millionaire?

1445
01:17:26,731 --> 01:17:27,564
He goes,
I want to use the last lifeline to call 

1446
01:17:28,921 --> 01:17:31,870
my dad to tell him I want.
You got that swagger.

1447
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:35,880
I love that.
Alright,

1448
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:38,040
well you want.
What would you like?

1449
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:38,821
What,
what do you want?

1450
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,830
You want to be surprised.
That's one item.

1451
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,770
Um,
well let's go ahead.

1452
01:17:44,771 --> 01:17:47,260
I'll take this one and then if I win the
second one,

1453
01:17:47,261 --> 01:17:51,640
then I'll have you guys surprised me.
I would love to have one of the,

1454
01:17:51,641 --> 01:17:53,080
uh,

1455
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:55,190
We have one of those.
Dan,

1456
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,460
welcome.
All right,

1457

Are you ready?
I'm ready.

1459
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,140
You're crushing it.
You're crushing it.

1460
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:08,363
Here we go.

1461
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:11,013
Try to click it.
It must be no close family day because 

1462
01:18:27,731 --> 01:18:29,680
he said,
can we play a quick game for a quick

1463
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:34,720
wow.

The big winner here today.

So much excitement.
So proud.

1467
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:51,680
Tell me,

1468
01:18:51,681 --> 01:18:53,300
won?
Are you going to Disneyland?

1469
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:55,523
Oh Man.
I'm going to go tell everyone that I 

1470
01:18:57,111 --> 01:19:01,310
know of my friends that watch you guys.
I want to be bragging all week.

1471
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:05,050
Well Chancellor,

who was gracious to participate with us 

1482
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:36,970

That was thrilling.

01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:00,080
Shoot.
It's always really fun.

1491

I love those.
I can't believe that we got him.

Yeah,
I know all the people.

1493
01:20:04,641 --> 01:20:07,070
He's for the queue.
That's right.

1494
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,090
We've got a lot more to get to.
My goodness.

01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,570
we've got the mom.
Let me see here.

1498
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:20,873
I've got Kanye,
but actually we were going to do harass 

1499
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:27,540
the teachers suing her student.
Let me do that first and then we'll have

1500
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,480
a in hop in here to give us a Kanye 
update.

1501
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:36,600
Kanye moves at light speed.
A lot goes on in that man's life.

1502
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:39,900
So this is a story that blew my mind.
And listen,

1503
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:41,610
I'm not,
I just.

1504
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,410
This is not like a social justice thing.
I'm not,

1505
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:46,320
I'm not,
that's not my angle here.

1506
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:49,710
I want to say I'm genuinely confused by 
this.

1507
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:51,990
I'm just,
I'm perplexed.

1508
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:52,943
I'm vexed in the words of the Great Bob 
Weiss who wrote that article about post 

1509
01:20:56,701 --> 01:21:00,240
Malone.
I like to be vexed at my concerts,

1510
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:07,020
like to be like that when I relaxed in 
the new music.

1511
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:12,980
So there's videos on buzzfeed and it is 
about a teacher who is suing,

1512
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,473
I believe the age was 13,
still suing her 13 year old student for 

1513
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:27,100
making fun of her in class.
Um,

1514
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,380
for being gay.
I guess.

1515
01:21:28,381 --> 01:21:30,420
I don't know.
It's really hard to tell from the video,

1516
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:34,950
but it's so strange.
The whole story is so strange and I just

1517
01:21:34,951 --> 01:21:35,784
find it strange,
bizarre that buzzfeed is taking this 

1518
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:39,840
approach,
like they're doing a journalistic video,

1519
01:21:39,841 --> 01:21:43,080
but it really doesn't answer any 
questions and doesn't.

1520
01:21:43,081 --> 01:21:44,340
Yeah,
and it's just,

1521
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:47,010
it's why it's a wild ride that I want to
take you guys on.

1522
01:21:47,011 --> 01:21:49,830
So with that being said,
let us enjoy.

1523
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:53,580
I was harassed by my student for being 
gay on buzzfeed video.

1524
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,493
Can you have with your students.
I really care that we accomplished 

1525
01:21:57,611 --> 01:21:58,444
whatever we set out to do,
but I'm also the first teacher to 

1526
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,720
volunteer to get a pie to the face or an
egg cracked on my head,

1527
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:05,573
like whatever it is to reward students.
One of the highlights of my job is the 

1528
01:22:08,351 --> 01:22:09,184
fact that I probably laugh cry at least 
once a day because the teenagers are 

1529
01:22:12,881 --> 01:22:15,220
funny and if you let them be funny,
they're really fun.

1530
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,140
Such she's drinking Pellegrino.
Wow.

1531
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,450
That's fancy for a school teacher.

1532
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:33,750
Usually you have to note that she looks 
the part.

1533
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,230
You have to note it from them.
Let's up.

1534
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:40,170
We're all thinking it,
just saying she has a.

1535
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,830
She has a cervical look.
Okay,

1536
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:46,650
moving on.
Don't have to note it.

1537
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:48,343
The thing is,
they were all looking at her and being 

1538
01:22:50,161 --> 01:22:50,994
like,
alright,

1539
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:52,430
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1540
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:55,230
There's something going on there.
She's got a specific look,

1541
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:57,840
you know,
that's okay.

1542
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:03,380
Like if I saw someone walking around and
like a Pekichu hat and like a reflective

1543
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:07,090
less than huge pants,
I'd be like,

1544
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:07,990
oh,
that guy's a raver.

1545
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:12,850
You know what I'm saying?
She's got to look.

1546
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,673
That's all

1547
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:18,930
is amy asked.
If I'm an eighth grade English teacher,

1548
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:21,120
I've been teaching for about 12 years 
now.

1549
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,553
How the school system,

1550
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:24,813
knowing that I've impacted a student or 
had a good day in the classroom is 

1551
01:23:27,941 --> 01:23:32,350
really indescribable because while 
education does not necessarily pay well,

1552
01:23:32,351 --> 01:23:33,840
what it does pay,
um,

1553
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,190
is knowing that you've had a chance to 
impact future generations.

1554
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:40,420
My goal is always to really understand 
where students come from.

1555
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:41,923
Bear in mind while they're,
while they're showing this and urbino 

1556
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,490
electron fit in,
great.

1557
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:49,650
She's still selling a 13 year old 
student [inaudible].

1558
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:55,780
I just find that those,
that dichotomy of those two things.

1559
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:58,360
Yeah.
You're assuming a 13 year old.

1560
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:00,100
What the fuck?
What a person,

1561
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:01,000
not just A.
I dunno,

1562
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:02,440
I dunno.
This is so weird.

1563
01:24:02,441 --> 01:24:04,510
I guess because he,
he harassed her,

1564
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:08,300
but the examples she gives doesn't seem 
that bad.

1565
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:12,950
It's more like for bullying,
her not harassed I guess.

1566
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,760
Um,
but I guess let's,

1567
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:19,060
let's let the do over and apparently it 
didn't work

1568
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:19,963
or a grade.
My story begins at the start of the 

1569
01:24:21,291 --> 01:24:22,340
2017,
20,

1570
01:24:22,341 --> 01:24:23,174
18 school year.
I had several students approached me 

1571
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:26,144
privately out of concern to let me know 
that a former student of mine who was 

1572
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:33,110
following me on instagram because they 
wanted to keep in touch with me,

1573
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:34,243
had taken a photo of me and my partner 
and posted it to her instagram and let 

1574
01:24:39,051 --> 01:24:42,440
my current students know that I was gay.
Prior to that,

1575
01:24:42,441 --> 01:24:43,274
I had never discussed my sexuality and 
the classroom intentionally because I 

1576
01:24:45,951 --> 01:24:46,784
know that I teach in a very conservative
climate and it wasn't something that I 

1577
01:24:50,121 --> 01:24:52,880
felt I needed to share right off the bat
with students.

1578
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:53,960
As the year progressed,

1579
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:56,143
somebody,
somebody's picture them with their 

1580
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:58,590
partner.
Yeah,

1581
01:24:58,591 --> 01:25:02,640
and I can't imagine that's gotta be hard
to be a teacher and you know,

1582
01:25:02,641 --> 01:25:03,474
it's so weird.
When I was a kid there was no social 

1583
01:25:05,701 --> 01:25:06,534
media.
Like I can only imagine like stocking 

1584
01:25:08,611 --> 01:25:09,444
your teacher and taking photos and then 
sharing it with all your classmates on 

1585
01:25:12,001 --> 01:25:13,140
instagram,
like cad.

1586
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:18,410
That's messed up so kids can be men.
So kids are straight up eve,

1587
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,480
especially 13.
That's like the most evil age.

1588
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:22,400
Absolutely.
You.

1589
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,900
They're all.
Every 13 year olds have freaking psycho.

1590
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:26,633
I mean the worst thing.
The worst thing I ever did do a teacher 

1591
01:25:27,961 --> 01:25:30,370
when I was in high school,
I think it was our principal because you

1592
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:32,700
such a Douche.
We like to Peter's House.

1593
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,180
It's pretty bad.
It's not that.

1594
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:39,900
It's not that bad is it?
I haven't ever done that.

1595
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:42,510
It's not that bad.
We followed him home and we're like,

1596
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,560
we found out where he is,
we're going to tap as hell.

1597
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:45,413
Shit.
I did what they're talking about in 

1598
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,160
this.
I took pictures and yeah,

1599
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:50,003
but there was no.
There was no fucking my space or 

1600
01:25:51,661 --> 01:25:52,494
anything like that.
Like what did you take photos with a 

1601
01:25:56,580 --> 01:26:01,080
camera when I was a kid and then we just
like draw nasty shit on it,

1602
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,740
make fun of the teacher.
But this is like amongst friends.

1603
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:04,574
This is sharing it with the world.
If you drew a funny picture of a photo 

1604
01:26:07,401 --> 01:26:09,230
and that everyone at the school saw it,
right.

1605
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:11,390
It just amplifies it times a thousand.
Right.

1606
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,700
Hey,
so anyway,

1607
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:14,780
I'm,
I'm sympathizing

1608
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:19,760
me to let me know that this was really a
hot topic on the Internet.

1609
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,180
It was a hot topic on campus and people 
were continuing to discuss it.

1610
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:25,810
I went to my administration multiple 
times

1611
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:28,100
in this day and age,
I can't.

1612
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:31,460
I have a hard time seeing that.
That'd be like,

1613
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,930
oh,
she's gay.

1614
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:34,603
Maybe I'm wrong though.
She says she's scared of area so I 

1615
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,900
could.
It could be hard probably,

1616
01:26:38,901 --> 01:26:43,220
but also you're kind of the adult in the
situation.

1617
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,600
Well,
at any rate,

1618
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,280
no,
I'm not judging her yet.

1619
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,243
Let's watch.

1620
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,413
No,
that I was concerned about this and I 

1621
01:26:49,681 --> 01:26:50,880
felt like things were getting out of.

1622
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:55,720
I love the shot of her just walking the 
area just like a.

1623
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:57,653
and the initial response was that this 
was the word that was used and that it 

1624
01:27:01,801 --> 01:27:04,740
would die down and to be fair,
I hope so too.

1625
01:27:04,741 --> 01:27:06,480
Unfortunately that's not what occurred.

1626
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,193
Okay.
So she says everyone hoped there was 

1627
01:27:09,821 --> 01:27:12,820
drama with die down,
so it's not what occurred.

1628
01:27:12,821 --> 01:27:17,530
So what's leading me to believe that 
somebody like started writing like slurs

1629
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,760
on the door or like keying her car or 
some shit like hate crimes.

1630
01:27:21,761 --> 01:27:24,140
Right.
Fix My mic here.

1631
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:25,750
Okay,
so let's see what happens.

1632
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:28,933
During that school year,
I was also pursuing my master of Arts 

1633
01:27:30,801 --> 01:27:31,634
degree.
I have to maintain an online youtube 

1634
01:27:33,261 --> 01:27:34,094
channel where I responded and reflected 
on things that I'd read or activities 

1635
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:38,804
I'd completed.
One night I noticed that a flood of 

1636
01:27:40,961 --> 01:27:41,794
students started to follow me on that 
account and then I received a comment 

1637
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:46,820
that said,
don't be stupid.

1638
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:47,683
Be a smarty.
You can join the Nazi party now 

1639
01:27:50,091 --> 01:27:51,980
accepting dikes.
So that's good.

1640
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:52,400
Haunt

1641
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,430
this comment on youtube.
This is what she said.

1642
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:56,743
Sadly it didn't end there.
She had one person write a rude comment 

1643
01:28:01,881 --> 01:28:04,430
on Youtube.
We get like 10 times,

1644
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:09,140
but especially it's like,
are you kidding me?

1645
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:12,800
One every five,
every personal,

1646
01:28:12,801 --> 01:28:14,990
every defect I have as a person is 
apparently,

1647
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:18,560
it's almost a relief for me to know that
every negative attribute of my,

1648
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:19,573
of my personalities because I'm Jewish 
and that really actually takes the load 

1649
01:28:23,751 --> 01:28:24,980
off.
I thought I was just,

1650
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:27,440
I guess I guess I can't do anything,
but yeah,

1651
01:28:27,441 --> 01:28:28,740
no,
I thought I had a,

1652
01:28:28,741 --> 01:28:30,650
like a lot of development and maturing 
to do,

1653
01:28:30,651 --> 01:28:33,960
but it turns out I'm just a job.
It's kind of a relief honestly.

1654
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:37,020
Um,
but,

1655
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,980
so this,
this.

1656
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,600
What happened is this comment sets her 
off down at the bench.

1657
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,670
So weird because it doesn't even seem 
personal.

1658
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,393
Like to honestly honestly,
as someone who's been on the receiving 

1659
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:54,530
end of shitty comments,
like it's not that bad.

1660
01:28:55,130 --> 01:29:00,130
It's not personal and it's kind of like,
it's kind of just a stupid thing because

1661
01:29:00,771 --> 01:29:02,220
it's like the Nazis

1662
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,380
are accepting dykes.
Like,

1663
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:06,480
that doesn't even make sense.
It's just being cheeky.

1664
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,480
Obviously rude and I entered what I 
understand being upset by it.

1665
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:10,523
But what happens is it sets her off on 
this personal crusade of trying to find 

1666
01:29:14,521 --> 01:29:17,700
out who wrote this comment a comment on 
youtube.

1667
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:21,780
So now she goes on like this war path.
And that's what was going on

1668
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:23,110
my mic.
Okay.

1669
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:24,483
It's

1670
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,390
why is this thing not tight?
Little droopy did I don't understand.

1671
01:29:28,391 --> 01:29:30,220
Why is it true?
They got pills for that.

1672
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:34,970
Where that.
Oh,

1673
01:29:34,971 --> 01:29:35,960
here.
I think.

1674
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:37,533
Is your mic drooping?
I know I should do that during our 

1675
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:41,203
testing.

1676
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:44,740
Why it's dripping.
It's dripping all over the place,

1677
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:45,613
Dude.

1678
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:46,863
Alright.

1679
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:54,210
This is where the podcast is.
Good technical issues.

1680
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:56,170
Coffee.
My exhale.

1681
01:29:56,171 --> 01:29:57,430
Fuck that.
So anyway,

1682
01:29:57,431 --> 01:29:58,264
she goes.
So if she just ignored the comment and 

1683
01:30:00,371 --> 01:30:01,960
she was like,
she said it's just drama.

1684
01:30:01,961 --> 01:30:05,650
It'll die down.
But she goes on this war path to say who

1685
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:09,640
wrote that comment?
And this ends up being her demise as far

1686
01:30:09,641 --> 01:30:11,620
as I can tell.
But like here we go.

1687
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:13,253
I immediately took a screenshot and send
it to my administration and asked them 

1688
01:30:16,431 --> 01:30:17,264
to sit down with me.
It took my administration month to meet 

1689
01:30:19,161 --> 01:30:19,994
with me.
What do you want me to do with the 

1690
01:30:21,711 --> 01:30:22,750
decision was made

1691
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:27,590
someone at your school.
It's one youtube comment.

1692
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:31,790
So like she,
she sent it to the principal and she was

1693
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:33,650
like,
you haven't suspended anybody yet,

1694
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:34,371
but anyway,
here,

1695
01:30:34,371 --> 01:30:37,010
let it,
this little app shut up.

1696
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:40,280
I'm going to play the video about 
tolerance to presented to the class

1697
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:41,173
I did that immediately,
sent it off to them and unfortunately 

1698
01:30:44,091 --> 01:30:44,924
they decided that they didn't like the 
direction of the lesson and I was told 

1699
01:30:47,211 --> 01:30:51,290
that it would occur later on what 
someone else had a chance to review it.

1700
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,153
I had started to experience some severe 
depression and even more severe anxiety 

1701
01:30:56,241 --> 01:30:57,074
about being in class because I felt like
I didn't know what was being said about 

1702
01:31:00,741 --> 01:31:01,574
me or what was being done and I also 
felt like I wasn't being supported or 

1703
01:31:04,581 --> 01:31:07,460
kept safe the way that I believe I 
deserve to.

1704
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,150
It was this bananas,
this one comment.

1705
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:13,870
Now all the sudden she's,
she's,

1706
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:16,450
I feel like it's just not the right job 
for her.

1707
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,433
Being a teacher is tough.
You got to have like really tough skin 

1708
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:22,173
or you know,
especially like we said with their 

1709
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,580
middle school teacher.
Yeah,

1710
01:31:24,581 --> 01:31:25,414
he's our fucking brutal man.
Nobody's going in as a gay teacher in a 

1711
01:31:29,891 --> 01:31:30,724
conservative area.
You kind of have to know this would 

1712
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:38,071
happen and you didn't know and she 
purposely kept it.

1713
01:31:38,710 --> 01:31:40,360
Yeah.
But you know,

1714
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:42,280
there's a chance that someone will find 
out.

1715
01:31:42,281 --> 01:31:45,490
So I was surprised she was a teacher for
12 years.

1716
01:31:45,491 --> 01:31:49,000
I've never encountered anything like,
but I just find it you,

1717
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:49,843
she said she's tougher toilet and she 
had a meltdown over one youtube comment 

1718
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,373
and I just imagined like print the 
carrying a print of it to the principal 

1719
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,990
and being like,
you need to do something about this.

1720
01:31:59,110 --> 01:31:59,943
Like what?

1721
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,970
It's like I,
even if you sympathize,

1722
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:03,000
it's like,
what do you want me to do?

1723
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:07,460
Trace the Ip called the cyber police and
so I,

1724
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:10,810
I can only imagine what that 
presentation look like that they vetoed.

1725
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:14,140
They're probably just like,
this is weird.

1726
01:32:14,141 --> 01:32:18,710
You're going to make a presentation over
one random comment and also you're going

1727
01:32:18,711 --> 01:32:19,670
to get worse.
Yeah.

1728
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:22,000
Okay.
Everybody.

1729
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:23,133
I saw this comment calling me a dyke and
saying that the Nazi party is accepting 

1730
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:32,100
and I want to know who was it,
and I put together a presentation that's

1731
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:33,484
like inviting the old,
don't feed the trolls as they famously 

1732
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:43,160
saved,
okay.

1733
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:45,773
By the

1734
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:49,800
I asked my students to those shots Topia
during a presentation,

1735
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:53,280
one of my students made some disparaging
comments about gay marriage,

1736
01:32:53,281 --> 01:32:55,830
which elicited quite a response from my 
students,

1737
01:32:56,190 --> 01:33:00,780
a lot of excitement and looking at me 
and definitely awaiting a reaction after

1738
01:33:00,781 --> 01:33:01,614
that.
Upon reviewing the student's written 

1739
01:33:02,701 --> 01:33:03,534
work,
I noticed that some more derogatory 

1740
01:33:05,551 --> 01:33:10,551
comments were used about gay people in 
her work and I brought that again to the

1741
01:33:10,771 --> 01:33:15,771
attention of my administration and my 
administrators felt like the best course

1742
01:33:15,961 --> 01:33:18,090
of action.
There was simply a teachable moment.

1743
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,193
I contacted my union at that point.
From there it escalated to me getting a 

1744
01:33:23,071 --> 01:33:26,020
regional rep involved from my union who 
eventually hired me.

1745
01:33:26,021 --> 01:33:26,854
A lawyer.

1746
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:32,850
Just imagine wanting to expel a student.
It's like you're ruining.

1747
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:35,890
You're trying to ruin the kids alive.
It's like you're the adult.

1748
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:39,160
I know they said something really mean 
and rude and homophobic.

1749
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:40,180
The 13.
Okay.

1750
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:41,014
They're pretty ignorant,
but I feel like if she took it in a 

1751
01:33:42,671 --> 01:33:44,180
different way,
maybe she.

1752
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:45,843
Yeah,
maybe she could have turned it into 

1753
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:51,400
exactly something that would teach them.
Like you be tolerant about it.

1754
01:33:51,401 --> 01:33:51,950
What did you,
what did,

1755
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:53,710
why did you say that?
What do you think?

1756
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:54,460
Yeah,
but.

1757
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:56,630
And then the principal actually seems 
like pretty cool,

1758
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:59,860
like even headed about it,
but like wanting like what is she?

1759
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:02,230
She's like,
this person wrote something homophobic.

1760
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:03,843
She's like out for blood.
Like you have to expect like the fuck 

1761
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,750
you know,
you're going after a kid man.

1762
01:34:10,751 --> 01:34:14,260
I mean they didn't threaten her or do 
anything like totally insane.

1763
01:34:14,261 --> 01:34:15,094
And then the realm of normal child 
behavior to be a Douche due to anxiety 

1764
01:34:21,941 --> 01:34:22,774
and depression.
Amy took a mental health leave from 

1765
01:34:24,521 --> 01:34:25,354
teaching.
Her case is currently being litigated 

1766
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:30,573
for what?

1767
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,193
I haven't been in the classroom since 
January and I would say that there are 

1768
01:34:34,661 --> 01:34:36,910
two things that I missed the most.
First and foremost,

1769
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,950
I love my colleagues.
I am lucky to work man.

1770
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:44,450
It's like a commercial for depression.
She's just out there picking grass.

1771
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:48,980
She's not in the classroom anymore.
Fuck

1772
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:51,483
incredible educators in terms of 
students and very sad that I didn't get 

1773
01:34:54,311 --> 01:34:55,144
to read Fahrenheit 4:51
with them or be there for their eighth 

1774
01:34:57,711 --> 01:34:58,430
grade graduation.

1775
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:01,820
It was really challenging for me to miss
out on both of those things.

1776
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:04,820
I don't feel frustration or anger 
towards students.

1777
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:05,840
I think that,
um,

1778
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,600
as teenagers we're always,
you know,

1779
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:11,600
they're growing and they're changing and
they're formulating their own opinions.

1780
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:15,980
The onus really lies on the adults in 
the system to do better.

1781
01:35:15,981 --> 01:35:18,740
And that's what I feel most disappointed
in.

1782
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:22,970
I don't even feel anger towards the 
adults in this situation.

1783
01:35:22,971 --> 01:35:23,840
I think that,
you know,

1784
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:27,400
my ultimate hope is that everyone learns
and grows so that we understand that,

1785
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:27,620
that

1786
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:31,190
close up man,
buzzfeed shots way to close up,

1787
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:35,720
show me the ear and Jiggling and picking
grass

1788
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,390
next time.
A situation like this occurs.

1789
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,130
We create a culture where

1790
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:46,200
she's got a job up per of plural feed.
What do you call that?

1791
01:35:46,301 --> 01:35:47,500
Dan used to be a Raver,
right?

1792
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:51,200
Laura?
Laura,

1793
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:54,341
peace.
Love,

1794
01:35:54,341 --> 01:35:55,240
unity.
Respect,

1795
01:35:55,241 --> 01:35:56,000
right?
Yeah.

1796
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,290
You got to do you.
You're not the only one that's partnered

1797
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:02,163
for life,
baby

1798
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:04,990
excepted and doesn't happen again.
Oh,

1799
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:05,873
you walked at a screen.

1800
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:08,650
We reached out to amy school for 
comment.

1801
01:36:08,651 --> 01:36:10,990
We include an excerpt from the response 
in the description.

1802
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:15,340
You didn't want to show it to too many 
people.

1803
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,090
Okay,
so she.

1804
01:36:16,090 --> 01:36:18,760
She's suing the school,
not the student.

1805
01:36:18,910 --> 01:36:20,450
Is that.
Am I understanding that correctly?

1806
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:21,820
Why?
I thought it was the student,

1807
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:24,520
but it doesn't actually say it says.
Yeah.

1808
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:25,980
It doesn't say.
It says [inaudible].

1809
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:28,920
Litigation is ongoing.
I would think it's.

1810
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:31,330
If anything it's cool.
I don't know why I thought it was a kid.

1811
01:36:31,331 --> 01:36:33,880
I remember reading that somewhere,
but I am an idiot.

1812
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,450
I just don't understand what the school 
could have done.

1813
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,730
I don't understand what the litigating 
is for.

1814
01:36:39,850 --> 01:36:40,683
I don't understand.
I don't even understand why this is a 

1815
01:36:43,271 --> 01:36:44,620
video at all.
Yeah,

1816
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:49,360
like there's no story here.
How is her making a youtube channel even

1817
01:36:49,361 --> 01:36:51,880
under the responsibility of the school?
Exactly,

1818
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:52,953
exactly.

1819
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,420
It's youtube.
Do people can find your videos.

1820
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:57,190
Yeah.
And did she say she was a.

1821
01:36:57,460 --> 01:36:58,293
She made the youtube channel for the 
master's degree that she was trying to 

1822
01:37:01,031 --> 01:37:02,870
get.
So this is like an extra trip.

1823
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:04,840
This doesn't even have to do with her 
work.

1824
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:08,980
How does she even know it was a student 
who made don't know.

1825
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:13,540
Here's a statement from a school's 
boring.

1826
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:17,650
It's very just what you would expect to 
be very illegal,

1827
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,660
but I'm just.
I just,

1828
01:37:19,661 --> 01:37:23,680
I wonder why this video even exists.
There's no information.

1829
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:26,440
Nothing happened as far as I can tell.
It's like,

1830
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:27,274
what?
What are you trying to prove with this 

1831
01:37:28,541 --> 01:37:30,340
video?
She's out there.

1832
01:37:30,341 --> 01:37:33,430
Kids are assholes.
Like that's it.

1833
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,760
She got us good.
Yup.

1834
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:42,400
Got It.
This Day and age,

1835
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,470
I was such a dick to.
My teachers.

1836
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:49,320
Definitely took,
you know,

1837
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,230
and they,
you know,

1838
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:51,760
they,
they were adults about it.

1839
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:52,623
They just,
I just moved on every time some one of 

1840
01:37:54,611 --> 01:37:55,680
my students,
me,

1841
01:37:55,681 --> 01:37:55,980
I want

1842
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,710
their life ruined and them to be 
expelled from school.

1843
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:01,470
Had to have to switch schools.
I want them in prison.

1844
01:38:01,471 --> 01:38:03,750
I want them at juvenile hall for any 
crime.

1845
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:07,470
So there you go.
I don't know.

1846
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:09,100
Buzzfeed is like,
it's like,

1847
01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:11,960
did you.
You didn't even have to make this year.

1848
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,470
There's a no story.

1849
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:14,723
They just.
They had this artistic vision for the 

1850
01:38:16,561 --> 01:38:17,550
close.
Yeah.

1851
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:18,653
They're like,
we start with the closeups and we build 

1852
01:38:19,621 --> 01:38:22,320
around that.
I had this vision of a bouncing,

1853
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:24,750
hearing,
Chubby hand picking grass

1854
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,470
art right there.
Yeah.

1855
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:30,420
That is art,
isn't it?

1856
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:35,590
There you have it folks.
I don't know why.

1857
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:36,910
Well Shit.
Do we have to change the title?

1858
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:39,970
We change it.
When we finished,

1859
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:41,920
I was thinking the same thing.

1860
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:45,820
Y'All got baited not as spicy.
No.

1861
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:47,740
Not as spicy,
but still pretty spicy.

1862
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,160
What else we got?
Kanye is back at it.

1863
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:52,600
Ian,
do you want to come?

1864
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:57,790
You want to come?
A decode.

1865
01:38:58,180 --> 01:38:59,800
Connie decoded.
I'm sending them in.

1866
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:01,560
Here we go.
Here comes in.

1867
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:04,150
Let me play you a song.
I got a song here.

1868
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:07,150
Where is it?
Here we go.

1869
01:39:08,330 --> 01:39:12,500
Thank you man.
What's going on with my mic?

1870
01:39:12,501 --> 01:39:15,230
But it's drooping like my fricken,
like every,

1871
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:17,620
like it's giving me flashbacks.
Don't need this.

1872
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:20,810
My face did.
How do I fix this?

1873
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:23,510
Hey,
and having mic issues.

1874
01:39:23,530 --> 01:39:25,900
Fines very.
This very virile Mike over here.

1875
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:26,990
Yeah,
you're a young man.

1876
01:39:26,991 --> 01:39:29,720
You're a young man to know and is also 
sick,

1877
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:36,220
so I don't know how to fix this.
There you go.

1878
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:41,570
Now I popped a couple of eds.
I'm upright.

1879
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:42,720
I'm.
How's.

1880
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:47,000
How's the sound right now?
Sound good.

1881
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:49,840
Really isn't not supposed to been filed 
that.

1882
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:51,380
No,
that one's less directional.

1883
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:56,900
Just popped a couple.
I took more than directed.

1884
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:02,720
Commoditized.
Ian.

1885
01:40:02,721 --> 01:40:04,730
How are you today?
God bless.

1886
01:40:04,731 --> 01:40:06,080
And good evening.
Good afternoon.

1887
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:09,630
There's something about you immediately 
want to touch and stop.

1888
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:11,780
Yeah,
I'm doing good.

1889
01:40:11,781 --> 01:40:13,490
I'm,
I'm back there.

1890
01:40:13,491 --> 01:40:18,491
Coffin to and places of fucking petri 
dish of Ebola.

1891
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:22,310
Um,
now before we get into this,

1892
01:40:22,311 --> 01:40:25,760
I want to say congratulate you.
I heard the great news.

1893
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:29,930
You've been made an honorary moderator 
of our Kanye.

1894
01:40:29,931 --> 01:40:31,660
Then youtube red,
which is,

1895
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:34,430
but that's a,
that's a huge community.

1896
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:35,870
Yeah.
They told me this morning,

1897
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:37,950
so congratulations.
Thank you.

1898
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,810
Now I know they got up to those guys.
I know the Kanye.

1899
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:42,653
If a community is very important to you 
and how do you feel about being given 

1900
01:40:45,801 --> 01:40:46,634
this honorary title?
I feel like the queen kind of 

1901
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:52,920
[inaudible] because he was like,
you don't have to actually moderate.

1902
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,230
We don't.
It kind

1903
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:55,690
of was like,
we don't want you to.

1904
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:58,960
Don't touch anything.
We want to put your name there and.

1905
01:40:58,990 --> 01:41:01,450
Wow,
that's cool.

1906
01:41:01,451 --> 01:41:02,284
That's cool.
Good.

1907
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:05,620
They don't want me to start banning 
people and digging around,

1908
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:10,840
but yeah.
So I feel you're getting street craig,

1909
01:41:10,841 --> 01:41:12,910
you're getting acknowledged for,
for um,

1910
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:16,870
there was also the invitation to the 
Kanye podcast,

1911
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:18,570
which is coming up.
Uh,

1912
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:20,350
what's the name and when is that 
happening?

1913
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:21,640
So people can tune in a,

1914
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:24,490
it's on the 10th,
I believe.

1915
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:27,670
Next I'm going to record it.
I don't know when he puts it out by the.

1916
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:29,140
It's called watching the throne.

1917
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:30,790
Watching.
Yeah,

1918
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:33,480
the premier Kanye West podcasts.
In fact,

1919
01:41:33,481 --> 01:41:36,100
the Kanye himself follows them on 
twitter,

1920
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:37,413
a recent development which has led us to
believe that Connie is a fan of Ian and 

1921
01:41:39,751 --> 01:41:40,584
it's been a along as,
as happened with the purple hat and 

1922
01:41:43,241 --> 01:41:45,490
everything.
So congratulations.

1923
01:41:45,491 --> 01:41:47,440
I'm waiting for you and it's going to be
against.

1924
01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:49,210
Yeah,
I'll be on there.

1925
01:41:49,211 --> 01:41:53,140
So watching the phone,
it's only a matter of time until I get a

1926
01:41:53,141 --> 01:41:53,974
knock on my door,
I open it and there's Kanye someday be 

1927
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,250
be a great guest.
Me.

1928
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:00,340
I joked about it.
I said,

1929
01:42:00,341 --> 01:42:03,370
if Kanye ever comes on here as a guest 
into going to sit here,

1930
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:05,230
I'm not gonna say Shit,
I'm not going to be in the room.

1931
01:42:05,231 --> 01:42:08,010
I'm just going to.
Maybe I'll sit there and I'll just,

1932
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,150
I'm not going to say shit.
Wash these two thought,

1933
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:12,393
but be that as it may,
there's been a lot of Kanye development 

1934
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:20,200
actually.
Is this a good place to start in?

1935
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:21,831
Uh,
yeah.

1936
01:42:21,831 --> 01:42:23,450
This is,
he tweeted this out.

1937
01:42:23,451 --> 01:42:27,020
He's trying to Kinda clarify his 
beliefs.

1938
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:31,730
Political beliefs a little bit.
Probably got tired of all the heat.

1939
01:42:31,731 --> 01:42:35,600
He was getting lots of heat,
lots of heat friends and family,

1940
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:37,410
you know,
dumping him.

1941
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:42,710
But he didn't really like.
I know I read these tweets and these,

1942
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:44,900
this doesn't mean much.

1943
01:42:45,610 --> 01:42:46,550
Let me read you.
Yeah,

1944
01:42:46,551 --> 01:42:47,384
go ahead.
I would like to take my family loved 

1945
01:42:48,141 --> 01:42:50,730
ones and community for supporting my 
actual beliefs of my visual.

1946
01:42:50,990 --> 01:42:52,970
Is this before or after?
He disavowed,

1947
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,110
this is before,
okay,

1948
01:42:54,111 --> 01:42:54,944
so I support those who risked their 
lives to serve and protect us and I 

1949
01:42:57,501 --> 01:43:00,890
support holding people who misuse their 
power accountable.

1950
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:01,903
I believe in love and compassion for 
people seeking asylum and parents who 

1951
01:43:03,981 --> 01:43:07,660
are fighting to protect their children 
from violent ors.

1952
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:08,743
I support creating jobs and 
opportunities for people who need them 

1953
01:43:10,341 --> 01:43:12,290
the most.
I swore prison reform,

1954
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:16,130
I support common sense gun laws that 
will make our world safer.

1955
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:17,173
What I see this as [inaudible].
This is a lot of liberal kind of left 

1956
01:43:20,871 --> 01:43:22,230
Lincoln leaning,
uh,

1957
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:24,710
beliefs and I think he's trying to reach
out and be like,

1958
01:43:24,711 --> 01:43:25,544
Hey,
I don't disagree with you on these 

1959
01:43:26,301 --> 01:43:27,830
points.
I just like Donald.

1960
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:29,833
Yeah.

1961
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,370
Yeah.
I think he's trying to,

1962
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:35,330
um,
which is what I've said before.

1963
01:43:35,690 --> 01:43:40,690
He's not like a heavy political guy.
A lot of this is kind of vague too.

1964
01:43:40,701 --> 01:43:42,440
I mean like,
you know,

1965
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:43,333
that's true.
I support holding people misuse their 

1966
01:43:44,931 --> 01:43:47,870
power accountable.
That's like a fun thing to say,

1967
01:43:47,871 --> 01:43:49,340
but I don't know what that means.

1968
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:53,680
I see it as me too stuff.
Oh,

1969
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:56,550
okay.
Or like Wall Street stuff too.

1970
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:57,843
But regardless,
it does heat up as he lives a lot of 

1971
01:44:00,591 --> 01:44:02,380
room for interpretation.
Does d dot,

1972
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:04,260
I mean,
I.

1973
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:08,440
So here we go.
So now there was a thing called black.

1974
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:09,770
What is blood exit in?

1975
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:13,680
He's had this woman around him for a 
while called Candice Owens.

1976
01:44:13,710 --> 01:44:14,543
She's kind of a right leaning political 
figure and she's been very close with 

1977
01:44:20,491 --> 01:44:21,324
him kind of ever since he put the hat on
and like in his circle going wherever 

1978
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:28,860
he's going,
she's always around.

1979
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:32,160
Interesting.
So she has this thing called black set.

1980
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:34,380
I hate saying the word,

1981
01:44:35,010 --> 01:44:38,080
it's not a good,
it's not a,

1982
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:41,160
how do you say?
A elegant to say no legs.

1983
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,810
It blacks it,
right?

1984
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:45,120
Black say.
But I mean that's,

1985
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:48,260
if you're trying to like combine the two
words that actually makes brexit.

1986
01:44:48,261 --> 01:44:50,200
It's a play on brexit.
Yeah.

1987
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:52,930
Well because you need an exit,
like the equity.

1988
01:44:54,430 --> 01:44:55,330
But yeah,

1989
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:59,980
it's like the black exit from the 
Democratic Party is what she wants.

1990
01:44:59,981 --> 01:45:03,460
She wants everyone to leave and mass.
And uh,

1991
01:45:03,970 --> 01:45:08,970
so she put out merge and told people 
that Kanye designed it.

1992
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:11,073
And I think that was kind of the 
breaking point which sparked all of 

1993
01:45:14,081 --> 01:45:14,540
this.

1994
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:17,690
Here's the logo and question actually.
Um,

1995
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:22,130
and also I will say not a very well 
designed a.

1996
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,750
looks like someone's being crucified.
And Jim Merge.

1997
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:27,683
Yeah,
it looks like some of my camp counselor 

1998
01:45:29,431 --> 01:45:30,250
would wear and

1999
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:31,810
not very.
Not very spicy.

2000
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:33,410
No,
it's not great.

2001
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:37,190
And so after that happened,
he came out and was like,

2002
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:38,250
no,
I,

2003
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:39,410
I didn't do that.

2004
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:40,340
Yeah.
And you're,

2005
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:42,060
you had an interesting theory about.

2006
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,161
I think,
yeah,

2007
01:45:44,161 --> 01:45:45,810
all of this.
Everyone thinks,

2008
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:46,440
oh,
he's like,

2009
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,430
come to his senses.
Oh,

2010
01:45:47,431 --> 01:45:48,264
he's realized the error of his ways.
I think he just didn't want to be 

2011
01:45:52,201 --> 01:45:53,860
associated with a shitty design.

2012
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:55,320
Right.
I think that he's like,

2013
01:45:55,321 --> 01:45:57,150
I'm not offended at all by your 
political beliefs.

2014
01:45:57,151 --> 01:45:57,984
I just asked Shit Week.
I don't want anyone to think that I put 

2015
01:46:00,751 --> 01:46:01,770
my name on that.
Yeah.

2016
01:46:01,771 --> 01:46:02,604
What he said in response to this design 
was actually something that has got a 

2017
01:46:06,511 --> 01:46:09,770
lot of attention.
A lot of people interacted with us.

2018
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:12,420
We'd have like hundreds of thousands of 
likes and retweets.

2019
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,060
And here it is.
He said,

2020
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:16,553
my eyes are now open,
and I now realized I've been used to 

2021
01:46:18,871 --> 01:46:20,990
spread messages.
I do not believe in.

2022
01:46:21,330 --> 01:46:22,163
I'm distancing myself from politics and 
completely focusing on being creative 

2023
01:46:26,430 --> 01:46:28,800
and that Brexit logo was whack.
He said,

2024
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:32,310
yeah,
and the one before he didn't so well.

2025
01:46:32,311 --> 01:46:35,430
He said essentially he had nothing to do
with it.

2026
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:38,640
So what do you make of this?
Is this a genuine.

2027
01:46:38,641 --> 01:46:42,570
And when this came out I just 
immediately started everywhere.

2028
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:44,820
Like everyone thinking that it's about 
trump.

2029
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:46,013
Yeah,
well that's what I assumed that it was 

2030
01:46:47,341 --> 01:46:48,330
about like,
hey.

2031
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:50,190
Yeah,
I mean that's really

2032
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,250
the only assumption that make really.
Well that's why.

2033
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:53,093
Yeah,
the so many likes and everyone 

2034
01:46:54,391 --> 01:46:56,040
immediately went,
oh fine.

2035
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:57,870
So he's back to,
you know,

2036
01:46:58,650 --> 01:46:59,483
just chilling out.
And that means he doesn't like 

2037
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:02,950
Republicans at all.
I think that was,

2038
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:03,893
we both jumped in,
which isn't the case because he 

2039
01:47:06,061 --> 01:47:08,610
clarified with TMZ,
which is the next thing,

2040
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:10,410
but his statements.
So dramatic.

2041
01:47:10,570 --> 01:47:11,403
My,
how could it mean anything else when he 

2042
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:16,140
says my eyes are now wide open,
it's like I've just,

2043
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:20,160
I've been awakened to this great.
A misfortune,

2044
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:21,023
you know,
I think it goes back to like with the 

2045
01:47:22,711 --> 01:47:26,130
first few tweets,
I think he does it on purpose.

2046
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:31,590
He leaves things vague and interesting 
to hear.

2047
01:47:31,591 --> 01:47:33,720
We have a,
what do we have here this,

2048
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:34,583
so this is from the TMZ article.
They reported it and their headline was 

2049
01:47:37,351 --> 01:47:38,184
something like Kanye has done with trump
and then he reached out to tmz right 

2050
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,673
away and it said Kanye contacted us to 
make it clear he did not mention Donald 

2051
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:48,294
trump and his tweets and he's getting 
out of politics altogether as for being 

2052
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:51,720
used.

2053
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:54,900
He says he was specifically ref 
referencing blacks and that's it.

2054
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:59,580
So interesting.
So it kind of.

2055
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:01,140
Let's see.
Is there a more,

2056
01:48:01,290 --> 01:48:02,370
uh,
you know,

2057
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,410
there isn't more.
Well,

2058
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:06,423
just more.
Is there anything genuine going on here 

2059
01:48:09,601 --> 01:48:14,460
or is this just more of kind of this 
Kanye trying to drum up attention?

2060
01:48:14,610 --> 01:48:17,070
What do you make of this?
He's what's happening here.

2061
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:20,540
In part I think the honorary,
a moderator of our continent,

2062
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:23,760
speaking for the subreddit Kanye Fan.
No,

2063
01:48:23,761 --> 01:48:24,594
I honestly,
I think that this may be why I have the 

2064
01:48:27,451 --> 01:48:28,770
flu.
I'm like,

2065
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:31,860
I'm tired.
I'm worn out,

2066
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:34,620
I mean it just,
I just want the album at this point,

2067
01:48:34,730 --> 01:48:36,230
you know,
it's,

2068
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:38,250
it's,
it's 20 days away,

2069
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:39,510
is it?
Well,

2070
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:42,110
if he's got a lot of work those out,
I don't know.

2071
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:45,930
And then I can't take what he says.
I don't know if he means it.

2072
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:47,490
Like when he goes,
I'm done with politics,

2073
01:48:47,491 --> 01:48:48,324
maybe that's this week and then he's 
going to debut it and he's gonna have 

2074
01:48:51,031 --> 01:48:53,730
the Maggot hat on again.
You know,

2075
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:57,380
it seems that that's a common theme.
Yes.

2076
01:48:57,420 --> 01:48:59,400
Oh yeah.
We need a segments.

2077
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:00,383
We can empower port credit.
It seems to be a common segment among 

2078
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:04,133
his,
a sentiment among his fans that it's 

2079
01:49:06,011 --> 01:49:08,880
like we're getting tired of this.
Just give us the music.

2080
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:11,000
Yeah.
And I,

2081
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:14,640
and I don't also,
he can believe whatever.

2082
01:49:14,641 --> 01:49:16,770
I don't care about that,
but you know,

2083
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,360
keeping track of it all.
Like you said,

2084
01:49:18,361 --> 01:49:20,070
it's like this whirlwind,
it's nonstop.

2085
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:24,170
He's always in the news.
There's always things going on in it.

2086
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:25,940
It's kind of tiring.
Right.

2087
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:27,203
Also there was a thing this week when 
easy as being like available for 

2088
01:49:30,631 --> 01:49:32,370
everyone now where you're following 
that.

2089
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:33,263
Yeah,
he because he said a while ago that he 

2090
01:49:35,971 --> 01:49:40,971
wants eventually to make it available 
for everyone that's production cells out

2091
01:49:41,761 --> 01:49:43,410
and then you're going to go to resell 
this.

2092
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:46,710
Interesting.
So now I think it was available,

2093
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:48,093
but then people were reporting that it's
not doing that well and they wonder if 

2094
01:49:50,801 --> 01:49:55,230
it's because of the drama or which one.
All of the past models are the new black

2095
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,920
one,
two models.

2096
01:49:57,540 --> 01:49:58,373
The last,
the release before the last one was the 

2097
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:03,700
biggest one he's ever done.
He's the most wide release ever,

2098
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:07,000
so there were going to be shoes 
available,

2099
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,900
but people took that as oh everyone 
hates Kanye now buying them.

2100
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:16,000
It's just that's the most they've ever 
made and I think it's the same case with

2101
01:50:16,001 --> 01:50:17,530
the new release to.
Got It.

2102
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:20,170
But I did see a few people reporting.
Oh yeah,

2103
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:23,010
that's because everyone.
Well you are wearing a pair,

2104
01:50:23,050 --> 01:50:24,330
you know,
not right now.

2105
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:25,173
Not right now.
Okay.

2106
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,113
Well Ian has already closed,
like easiest are fundamentally for 

2107
01:50:28,691 --> 01:50:31,540
everyone and no one cares.
You don't care.

2108
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:35,200
And then yeah,
they make it about politics of course.

2109
01:50:35,201 --> 01:50:35,921
And there you go.
Well,

2110
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:37,600
Kanye is political,
so I guess,

2111
01:50:37,601 --> 01:50:42,601
but you know.
Well we thank you for keeping us updated

2112
01:50:43,001 --> 01:50:43,900
on the world of coming.
Yeah,

2113
01:50:43,901 --> 01:50:45,310
I know.
It's complicated stuff.

2114
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:50,340
Keeping up with the Kardashians.
It is pretty much.

2115
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:51,433
Do you think that Ken's reality stardom 
has affected Kanye in the sense that he 

2116
01:50:55,401 --> 01:50:56,480
saw.
Oh,

2117
01:50:56,481 --> 01:50:57,314
keeping up with the Kardashians.
Everybody cares about this kind of real 

2118
01:50:59,451 --> 01:51:00,284
life drama.
Is that something that maybe lead off 

2119
01:51:02,121 --> 01:51:02,954
into Kanye?

2120
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,513
No,
I think he's always had a talent for 

2121
01:51:06,381 --> 01:51:09,290
this and I think that's why they're so 
great.

2122
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:12,120
They're just these marketing machines.
Yeah.

2123
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:14,270
So you know,
it's powerful.

2124
01:51:14,271 --> 01:51:17,810
Smell Ian's to keep your ear to the 
grind stone.

2125
01:51:17,811 --> 01:51:19,220
Is that a saying?
Is that what they say?

2126
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:21,530
I don't think so.
What do you keep your ear towards?

2127
01:51:21,950 --> 01:51:23,330
Your ear to the ground.
Oh,

2128
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:25,190
ear to the ground.
To the ground.

2129
01:51:25,370 --> 01:51:28,300
Keep to the ground and I'll go listen to
the grind plate,

2130
01:51:28,490 --> 01:51:31,630
but listen to every one grindstone and 
on the other.

2131
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:35,750
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

2132
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:41,900
Where's the song?
Sorry guys.

2133
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:46,250
Everyone is sick.
Jesus did not breathe yet.

2134
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:51,290
Don't break the law and the intern.
Everybody we love you and the enter,

2135
01:51:53,190 --> 01:51:56,630
he's wonderful guy.
He's an asset to the show and a boy.

2136
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:58,280
Boy,
where would we be without one?

2137
01:51:59,710 --> 01:52:01,760
Would know a lot less about content,
that's for sure.

2138
01:52:05,570 --> 01:52:07,020
Twitch,
uh,

2139
01:52:07,070 --> 01:52:09,230
we've got a twitch streamer who had a 
great little clip.

2140
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:12,320
Um,
this is kind of funny because this guy's

2141
01:52:12,350 --> 01:52:14,840
not even a big streamer.
Oh Man.

2142
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:15,590
Oh No,
nevermind.

2143
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:20,180
It's not a racist.
He's not even a big streamer.

2144
01:52:20,181 --> 01:52:22,610
That's what makes it so great.
Oh my God.

2145
01:52:22,611 --> 01:52:24,950
This twitter clip has over 3 million 
views,

2146
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:27,703
but because what he says is just so.
And he's a twitch streamer that has 

2147
01:52:30,741 --> 01:52:33,200
like,
well,

2148
01:52:33,201 --> 01:52:36,320
I don't know how big he is on twitch,
but he has got like 5,000

2149
01:52:36,321 --> 01:52:38,900
twitter followers.
So man

2150
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:43,530
for streamers that I want to relate to 
them.

2151
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:46,010
I want them to be witty.
I want them to be cool.

2152
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,940
I want them to have that unique aspect 
that all of us strive to have.

2153
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:51,273
Um,
but I need there to be a little bit of 

2154
01:52:52,751 --> 01:52:52,880
time

2155
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:53,713
coughing super loud in the mic because I
keep turning away that I want to make 

2156
01:52:55,731 --> 01:52:57,020
sure I'm not,
you're raping everybody.

2157
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:00,560
It's helping turn more if you can.
Yeah.

2158
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:04,730
Or relationship because I don't want to 
talk to a fucking wall.

2159
01:53:04,950 --> 01:53:06,160
Okay.
But will,

2160
01:53:06,170 --> 01:53:07,003
part of the thing for me is,
is I specifically don't want my viewers 

2161
01:53:09,651 --> 01:53:11,380
to have any kind of relationship with 
me.

2162
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:13,070
So like that's like it kind of works 
out,

2163
01:53:13,071 --> 01:53:13,904
right?
I'm Kinda like I'm hitting my goal but 

2164
01:53:15,171 --> 01:53:16,004
I'm,

2165
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:21,350
that's kind of a bad strategy which I 
know I kind of,

2166
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:25,220
I'm doing a live stream and I don't want
to be connected to anybody.

2167
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:26,653
Maybe make videos.

2168
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:28,540
No,
you totally are.

2169
01:53:29,190 --> 01:53:30,610
And as weird as that sounds and it's 
like,

2170
01:53:31,090 --> 01:53:31,923
it's kind of like low key like God 
complex kind of thing is I don't feel 

2171
01:53:36,011 --> 01:53:39,040
like many of my viewers should relate 
themselves to me because.

2172
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:40,353
And this is like super,
like Kinda like I got caught like kinda 

2173
01:53:43,321 --> 01:53:45,730
weird.
It's like I do think of myself as better

2174
01:53:45,731 --> 01:53:48,250
than,
or not better but like bigger.

2175
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:50,800
This is going so there's no good way to 
say this.

2176
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:53,380
I think of myself as like above the 
average person,

2177
01:53:53,381 --> 01:53:57,130
so I don't feel like many people could 
relate to me as like bad as that sounds.

2178
01:53:57,131 --> 01:53:57,964
I know why.

2179
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:07,630
Like what would even if you're so 
superior and intelligent and like a 2:20

2180
01:54:07,690 --> 01:54:10,260
Iq,
huge rick and morty fan.

2181
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:14,070
Why would you think that was a good idea
to say?

2182
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:20,420
Sounds like such a prick.
You're just a fucking like ta also.

2183
01:54:21,061 --> 01:54:21,894
He's like not even a big deal on twitch 
and it's nice just pulled up the social 

2184
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:27,690
worker who's got like 11,000
followers.

2185
01:54:28,230 --> 01:54:29,063
I just want to say I just want to say 
this and I don't want you to take the 

2186
01:54:31,501 --> 01:54:33,450
wrong way,
but I do have 11,000

2187
01:54:33,451 --> 01:54:37,320
followers on twitter and I do think,
and again this comes off bad,

2188
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:38,333
but I am superior in every way.
I mean how many followers you have on 

2189
01:54:42,601 --> 01:54:43,800
twitter?
What?

2190
01:54:43,801 --> 01:54:45,450
Like what?
Like 200.

2191
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:48,240
I mean case in point.
You're fucking pathetic.

2192
01:54:49,410 --> 01:54:51,930
Damn,
this guy got reamed for this video.

2193
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:55,590
How did you think that that could be 
anything worth saying?

2194
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:56,453
Also,
I like how he keeps referring to it as 

2195
01:54:57,361 --> 01:55:00,420
like a gum God complex,
low key God complex.

2196
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,670
It's like,
well that he knows that it sounds bad,

2197
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,291
but it's like,
yeah,

2198
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:06,620
it did because it is bad.
I can say that like what are you doing?

2199
01:55:06,630 --> 01:55:07,463
But I feel like he's flattering himself 
in a way of like saying he has a god 

2200
01:55:10,741 --> 01:55:13,760
complex too because again,
you're not,

2201
01:55:13,761 --> 01:55:14,594
you're not even justify.
You can't even have a god complex when 

2202
01:55:16,591 --> 01:55:18,150
you have 11,000
twitter followers.

2203
01:55:20,190 --> 01:55:23,760
Like imagine.
Imagine that guy's a god.

2204
01:55:25,410 --> 01:55:26,243
Yo.
I'm so.

2205
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:28,680
I do.
I am somewhat of a god complex.

2206
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:35,240
I feel like a god complex.
So there you have it.

2207
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:39,550
Twitch and apparently there was like a 
video.

2208
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:42,430
No,
it's just like kind of weird text.

2209
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:48,500
Not Better,
but like no bigger than just long and no

2210
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:49,533
good way to say this.
I think of myself as like above the 

2211
01:55:51,211 --> 01:55:52,044
average person,
so I don't feel like many people could 

2212
01:55:53,461 --> 01:55:57,540
relate to me as like bad as that sounds.
I know what a fucking idiot.

2213
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:01,620
There you go.
There you have it.

2214
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:06,450
Nice.
Oh,

2215
01:56:06,451 --> 01:56:08,170
this store is fantastic.
You,

2216
01:56:08,210 --> 01:56:10,350
you're going to love this specifically 
you Ila,

2217
01:56:11,980 --> 01:56:12,813
um,
porn watching employee infected 

2218
01:56:16,621 --> 01:56:17,454
government network with Russian malware 
that the fucking title you've ever seen 

2219
01:56:23,161 --> 01:56:25,560
in your life.
Listen to this shit.

2220
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:30,330
Government auditors traced a malware 
infection back to a single porn watching

2221
01:56:30,331 --> 01:56:31,164
employ within the US geographical survey
and the interior department watchdog 

2222
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:36,293
recommended the US Geographical Survey 
Ratchet Up Internet security protocols 

2223
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:41,430
after discovering its network had been 
infected with malware.

2224
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:42,503
So I guess there's like a government 
agency network that kind of connects 

2225
01:56:46,321 --> 01:56:49,460
everything and they have really strict 
rules about what,

2226
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:53,760
how you can use the internet because 
that's where so slick that Russia,

2227
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:59,120
they're like banking on the fact that 
some employees meeting off at work do.

2228
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:04,050
Did you ever like put on porn at work?
I'm like,

2229
01:57:04,230 --> 01:57:07,230
why would you do that?
I'll say this,

2230
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:16,920
I'll say that you have a lot of downtime
at work.

2231
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:19,910
You can have a lot of downtime.
Okay.

2232
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:25,220
It says that he reportedly used the 
computer to visit 9,000

2233
01:57:26,731 --> 01:57:30,570
adult video sites that sell fucking.
That's a lot.

2234
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,970
Like if I'm browsing Reddit,
you know,

2235
01:57:32,971 --> 01:57:36,390
at work and my,
my desk is facing the wall.

2236
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:38,521
It's like,
yeah,

2237
01:57:38,521 --> 01:57:41,080
you see some titties on the home page 
and you probably,

2238
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:41,953
you probably,
you take a look but you don't do when 

2239
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:46,560
you're not.
I'm not downloading porn videos.

2240
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:53,300
Not like augmenting my catalog.
This guy's like on fucking pornhub,

2241
01:57:54,481 --> 01:57:58,930
like downloading shit.
They said 9,000

2242
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:01,580
sites.
How do you want that?

2243
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:04,620
That's his job.
Watching porn is his job.

2244
01:58:04,621 --> 01:58:06,690
I don't know what he does with the 
geographical services.

2245
01:58:07,730 --> 01:58:10,150
That's not just popping over to pornhub.

2246
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:11,953
You either.
Are you asking if I got my dick out and 

2247
01:58:14,461 --> 01:58:15,181
masturbate?
No,

2248
01:58:15,181 --> 01:58:17,220
you.
Yeah,

2249
01:58:17,221 --> 01:58:21,210
that's what I'm asking.
But I did exactly.

2250
01:58:21,211 --> 01:58:25,740
That's why I don't like watching porn at
work because it's like I'm not,

2251
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:28,470
some people watch porn,
like it's like a cooking show.

2252
01:58:28,510 --> 01:58:33,510
So for me it's very.
When I put it on and let's be frank,

2253
01:58:34,081 --> 01:58:37,920
I'm not cleaning the pipes,
getting the poison out as they say.

2254
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:39,560
And so,
um,

2255
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:41,433
it's like that's kind of the reason why 
I don't understand going to a strip 

2256
01:58:43,241 --> 01:58:44,080
club.
It's like,

2257
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:44,973
okay,
I've never been to a strip club and I 

2258
01:58:45,941 --> 01:58:47,320
really have no interest because it's 
like,

2259
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:50,020
okay,
yeah,

2260
01:58:50,021 --> 01:58:51,920
what do you do?
Go home and beat off.

2261
01:58:51,921 --> 01:58:53,040
That's the same thing I was going to do 
anyway,

2262
01:58:53,670 --> 01:58:56,320
saved the money,
watch some porn,

2263
01:58:57,310 --> 01:59:00,280
and then let some Russian malware.
But you got to,

2264
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:02,560
you got to admire the ingenuity of these
Russian,

2265
01:59:02,561 --> 01:59:07,510
like cyber warriors putting like putting
ads on porn sites with malware.

2266
01:59:07,570 --> 01:59:09,430
I mean,
that's crazy.

2267
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:14,160
That's amazing.
Um,

2268
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:16,511
I love,
by the way,

2269
01:59:16,511 --> 01:59:19,030
there's like digital detectives that 
they go.

2270
01:59:19,031 --> 01:59:19,864
Our digital forensic examination 
revealed that the employee had an 

2271
01:59:22,781 --> 01:59:26,110
extensive history of visiting adult 
pornography websites.

2272
01:59:26,710 --> 01:59:30,760
The hosted malware,
a rope.

2273
01:59:31,570 --> 01:59:34,540
The malware was downloaded to the 
employees government laptop,

2274
01:59:34,570 --> 01:59:39,460
which then exploited the USG s network.
Isn't that awesome?

2275
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:41,493
This is the best episode of CSI ever.
The employee no longer works at the 

2276
01:59:46,091 --> 01:59:50,560
agency.
We imagine trying to get his next job.

2277
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:54,700
He had a good run having to say why it 
was firing his next job.

2278
01:59:54,701 --> 01:59:57,130
He can host a porn site.
He's got 9,000

2279
01:59:57,131 --> 01:59:59,340
videos.
Um,

2280
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:04,510
do you have a recommendation of me like 
his next job interview?

2281
02:00:05,051 --> 02:00:05,884
Oh yeah.
So tell me what part do you like over 

2282
02:00:07,601 --> 02:00:08,434
the last 15 years?
Similar scandals have enveloped the 

2283
02:00:10,481 --> 02:00:11,314
environmental protection agency,
securities and exchange commissions and 

2284
02:00:14,441 --> 02:00:15,274
irs.

2285
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:16,413
Last year a DC area news network 
uncovered egregious on the job 

2286
02:00:19,751 --> 02:00:24,751
pornography viewing at a dozen federal 
agencies and national security officials

2287
02:00:25,241 --> 02:00:28,510
have reportedly found an unbelievable 
amount of child pornography.

2288
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:30,430
Wow.
That threw me off.

2289
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:33,010
I didn't expect that on government 
devices.

2290
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:36,280
Fucking hell.
What were the people watching child porn

2291
02:00:36,281 --> 02:00:39,040
and downloading it and they work at the 
government.

2292
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:40,233
Fuck this problem.
This problem is so prevalent that a rep 

2293
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:46,713
Mark Meadows has introduced legislation 
banning pornography at federal agencies 

2294
02:00:50,621 --> 02:00:54,040
three different times.
I don't think you need a,

2295
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:57,840
uh,
what's the legislation going to do this?

2296
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:58,713
God dammit,
you guys stop watching porn on your 

2297
02:01:00,551 --> 02:01:05,551
government computers putting national 
security at risk.

2298
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:10,930
That's amazing.
I hope that in 15 years there's like a,

2299
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:14,470
there's a story of like a movie about 
this,

2300
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:15,983
about like how the Russians hacked the 
wine guy watching and dumb ass 

2301
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:19,534
downloading porn.

2302
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,810
But I bet you isla of people that have 
private offices have,

2303
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:30,400
a lot of them have been off at work.
It's like,

2304
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:33,340
well of course.
I mean,

2305
02:01:33,580 --> 02:01:35,650
you're not going to beat off in front of
people.

2306
02:01:35,651 --> 02:01:36,760
It's kind of nuts,
isn't it?

2307
02:01:37,330 --> 02:01:39,560
Yeah.
So like,

2308
02:01:39,561 --> 02:01:42,140
dude,
right here,

2309
02:01:42,270 --> 02:01:43,220
hey,
you're just like this.

2310
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:47,810
We have seen those videos of people 
doing it in the library.

2311
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:48,890
Yeah,
that's why.

2312
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:50,150
I mean,
those guys are deranged.

2313
02:01:50,151 --> 02:01:51,220
I don't have to say.
Yeah,

2314
02:01:51,230 --> 02:01:55,850
I've seen videos of like a drifters who 
come in and just start beating it in the

2315
02:01:55,851 --> 02:01:57,020
library.
It's like,

2316
02:01:57,370 --> 02:02:00,770
Dude,
magic bean that depraved though.

2317
02:02:00,771 --> 02:02:02,410
You see some titties and you're like,
all right,

2318
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:06,820
taking my dick out.
Um,

2319
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:08,090
yes,
yes,

2320
02:02:08,091 --> 02:02:08,924
of course.
So we made it to the two hour while I'm 

2321
02:02:12,201 --> 02:02:13,700
on.
I want to finish what we've got.

2322
02:02:13,701 --> 02:02:17,300
God it.
This is a lot of male bombers,

2323
02:02:17,301 --> 02:02:18,110
car whatever.

2324
02:02:18,110 --> 02:02:18,943
I don't care about that anymore.
Children Fight Club don't really care 

2325
02:02:21,621 --> 02:02:26,090
about it that much.
Judge dredd pretty cool.

2326
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:30,740
I'm parking intentionally break.
Oh,

2327
02:02:30,741 --> 02:02:31,790
this one.
I like this one.

2328
02:02:31,791 --> 02:02:35,120
I need to show you guys.
Party intentionally breaks the floor and

2329
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:38,150
everybody falls through.
Now before I show you this,

2330
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:39,313
I want to tell you that I read that 
there was no life threatening injuries 

2331
02:02:42,321 --> 02:02:45,650
and no fatalities as a result of this,
which is surprising when you look at the

2332
02:02:45,651 --> 02:02:47,390
footage.
Looks so horrific,

2333
02:02:47,810 --> 02:02:48,643
but it is hilarious.
And especially when you learn when you 

2334
02:02:50,601 --> 02:02:51,434
read the article is that um,
they felt the ground shaking and they 

2335
02:02:56,271 --> 02:03:00,710
were trying to break it.
Now that's a party turning up.

2336
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:04,370
I don't know how to view it.
And so were they placed in the screen,

2337
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:07,250
but um,
hopefully you can make that out.

2338
02:03:07,310 --> 02:03:09,110
Don't fullscreen the uh,
the window.

2339
02:03:09,230 --> 02:03:10,970
Just drag it to the,
to the right a little bit.

2340
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:12,770
Oh No,
what I'm saying.

2341
02:03:12,830 --> 02:03:14,010
Yeah,
I got centered.

2342
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:15,140
Is that good?
Perfect.

2343
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:19,430
Okay,
so fucking hell.

2344
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:22,450
So these guys are like,
whoa.

2345
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:23,293
The ground's all wobbly and so everybody
starts jumping and attempt to actually 

2346
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:30,380
fucking break it.
And so here they go.

2347
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:34,610
Having the time of their life and a 
woopsie daisy,

2348
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:36,313
a thin ice.
And now some of the people if you watch 

2349
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:42,770
some books.
So yeah,

2350
02:03:42,830 --> 02:03:47,120
but I mean there's like 100 people or 
some of the people slanted standing up.

2351
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,580
One Dude in the white shirt,
you'll see he landed.

2352
02:03:49,630 --> 02:03:52,610
He's like,
watch this guy in the white shirt here,

2353
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:54,433
right here.
I think he slides down and he's just 

2354
02:03:57,231 --> 02:03:58,220
like,
right here.

2355
02:03:58,340 --> 02:03:59,173
He's like,
what the fuck?

2356
02:04:00,490 --> 02:04:01,323
That's crazy.
Huh?

2357
02:04:02,150 --> 02:04:06,950
So there you have it.
Like the commentary just Yo,

2358
02:04:08,570 --> 02:04:11,120
that guy just almost fell to the ground 
by the way.

2359
02:04:11,990 --> 02:04:13,670
I love that.
He's like everyone,

2360
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:16,040
like the guy right in front of him falls
into an abbess.

2361
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:17,720
He's literally at the edge and he's 
like,

2362
02:04:17,721 --> 02:04:18,554
all right,
this is the presence of mind to just 

2363
02:04:19,851 --> 02:04:20,684
keep rolling.
Yeah.

2364
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:23,450
What a legendary cameras.
That's a new video.

2365
02:04:26,630 --> 02:04:30,860
Wouldn't you be panicked when you want 
to get out of the room at that point?

2366
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:34,370
Like maybe more of a idea?
No,

2367
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:39,540
that's why you'll never be.
I love it.

2368
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,520
I just loved it.
They were trying to do it,

2369
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:50,060
you know that I grants Gretz lady drives
through marathon,

2370
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:52,590
you know,
it's just a bunch of bids.

2371
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:54,083
I'll save it.
I want to watch a lot of these with Tom 

2372
02:04:55,141 --> 02:04:57,060
and Christina.
I think we'll have a lot of good bands.

2373
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:02,610
Yes.
Should I have this message from the,

2374
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:07,500
from the email,
but it's kind of emotional.

2375
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:10,860
Yeah.
So,

2376
02:05:10,861 --> 02:05:14,850
uh,
uh.

2377
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:19,030
Should I read it now?
I asked you so it's uncomfortable so you

2378
02:05:19,031 --> 02:05:19,864
can read it.
I can already say that I probably won't 

2379
02:05:22,211 --> 02:05:26,110
be able to speak because I can't handle 
this show's over.

2380
02:05:26,530 --> 02:05:27,400
No,
I'll sit here,

2381
02:05:27,401 --> 02:05:30,790
but I just am probably.
I can't really talk about these subjects

2382
02:05:30,791 --> 02:05:32,510
because I get too emotional.
Okay.

2383
02:05:32,670 --> 02:05:34,720
Nope.
You just give a shout out to the.

2384
02:05:34,780 --> 02:05:35,531
Yeah.
Hey,

2385
02:05:35,531 --> 02:05:36,550
we heard your message.

2386
02:05:39,590 --> 02:05:43,490
I thought it was such a sweet message 
and a very wholesome.

2387
02:05:43,491 --> 02:05:45,830
It's very nice message.
So I want it to read.

2388
02:05:45,831 --> 02:05:50,190
It comes from heart bridges.
Hey Ethan,

2389
02:05:50,191 --> 02:05:53,320
in Isla and podcast crew.
My name is Hart bridges.

2390
02:05:53,330 --> 02:05:58,330
A month ago my mom was unexpectedly 
diagnosed with stage four lymphoma.

2391
02:05:58,790 --> 02:06:01,400
She recently passed her second treatment
of Chemo.

2392
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:03,920
She's doing pretty good,
but morale is low.

2393
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:05,083
She was such an active person,
always working out and doing different 

2394
02:06:08,301 --> 02:06:09,134
projects around the house,
but now she feels weak and unable to 

2395
02:06:11,781 --> 02:06:12,614
accomplish anything.
We started listening to the podcast 

2396
02:06:14,901 --> 02:06:15,734
together about five months ago.
We listed in the car sometimes around 

2397
02:06:18,411 --> 02:06:22,400
the house and now at the hospital during
her six hour plus treatments.

2398
02:06:22,820 --> 02:06:23,653
We both find y'all absolutely hilarious.
Her birthday's coming up in November on 

2399
02:06:29,421 --> 02:06:30,254
the seventh and I was wondering if I 
could get you to sign a shirt for a pay 

2400
02:06:36,111 --> 02:06:37,100
for the shirt and shipping.

2401
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:37,933
If even you could just sign it.
She would love it so much and I know 

2402
02:06:40,381 --> 02:06:43,190
it'd make her smile.
Just pick a great shirt.

2403
02:06:43,250 --> 02:06:47,750
She wears a large love Ya bark.
Bridgett Hart bridges.

2404
02:06:47,751 --> 02:06:50,570
Well obviously.
Yeah,

2405
02:06:50,571 --> 02:06:53,330
dude,
do we have his address?

2406
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:55,300
I'll have to follow up.
Dan.

2407
02:06:55,310 --> 02:06:56,660
Maybe you can follow up and get the 
address,

2408
02:06:56,661 --> 02:06:59,000
but yeah,
of course we are definitely be sending a

2409
02:06:59,660 --> 02:07:02,720
care package out and um,
I just,

2410
02:07:02,900 --> 02:07:04,270
that's so sweet.
I love this.

2411
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:06,320
That they're watching together and the 
mom,

2412
02:07:06,321 --> 02:07:07,490
I don't,
I love it.

2413
02:07:07,491 --> 02:07:10,880
I think it's so.
I wish you the best and I wish her momma

2414
02:07:11,120 --> 02:07:16,120
healthy and speedy recovery.
We know all too well ilow especially how

2415
02:07:17,450 --> 02:07:22,450
tough that is.
So it's very nice that you took the time

2416
02:07:22,521 --> 02:07:24,720
to write that and share,
you know,

2417
02:07:24,721 --> 02:07:25,260
it's not,
uh,

2418
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:26,900
I appreciate.
I appreciate it man.

2419
02:07:26,901 --> 02:07:28,710
And I wish you all the best,
you know,

2420
02:07:30,590 --> 02:07:33,740
fucking life.
It gets tough sometimes.

2421
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,540
Unbearably tough,
you know,

2422
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:39,843
and it's an honor that we're able to 
provide some kind of comfort for you 

2423
02:07:45,521 --> 02:07:46,241
guys.
I mean,

2424
02:07:46,241 --> 02:07:47,074
that's,

2425
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:51,133
that

2426
02:07:51,910 --> 02:07:53,620
means a lot.
I mean,

2427
02:07:53,621 --> 02:07:55,510
it really hearing that,

2428
02:07:57,390 --> 02:08:01,290
like this dude with his mom getting 
chemo and watching our podcasts,

2429
02:08:01,291 --> 02:08:05,700
getting relief,
like all the shit we get and everything.

2430
02:08:05,701 --> 02:08:08,830
It's like you got to cut through it for 
these kinds of stories.

2431
02:08:08,850 --> 02:08:10,830
Like,
no,

2432
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:11,713
no,
no.

2433
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:13,780
I appreciate you taking the time right 
then.

2434
02:08:13,830 --> 02:08:16,880
And of course we're be honored to hook 
your mom up.

2435
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:17,850
We Love,
love,

2436
02:08:17,851 --> 02:08:18,684
love,
love,

2437
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:21,660
and appreciate you.
So thank you for reading us.

2438
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:23,783
I'm not to end on a heavy note.
Should we watch a psychic slam dunks a 

2439
02:08:30,871 --> 02:08:33,060
bunch of people?
No,

2440
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:36,000
no,
that's very long one.

2441
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:40,110
Um,
you know,

2442
02:08:43,410 --> 02:08:44,243
I guess there's a,
you have to assume that somebody likes 

2443
02:08:46,111 --> 02:08:47,970
this podcast because people listened to 
it.

2444
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:49,313
If you listen to the comments and the 
and go to a homepage on youtube or read 

2445
02:08:55,140 --> 02:08:55,973
anywhere,
it feels like nobody likes this podcast 

2446
02:08:58,891 --> 02:09:02,430
and everybody wants it to go away,
but somebody likes it.

2447
02:09:02,431 --> 02:09:03,450
I mean,
people will watch it,

2448
02:09:04,530 --> 02:09:07,020
right?
Mean there's a few out there.

2449
02:09:07,050 --> 02:09:12,050
This person likes it.
So I guess we should keep,

2450
02:09:12,810 --> 02:09:13,643
you know,
it's like.

2451
02:09:14,190 --> 02:09:17,060
Okay.
Right.

2452
02:09:19,050 --> 02:09:22,890
Well on that note we.

this is our playout.
Sorry.

2457
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:39,740
Can you mute it in my room at least 
because I can't even hear myself.

2458
02:09:40,010 --> 02:09:41,780
There we go.
So everybody can hear this.

2459
02:09:41,781 --> 02:09:45,610

2461
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:51,710

2462
02:09:51,711 --> 02:09:55,400
doing an Acapella h three they've 
signed.

2463
02:09:55,790 --> 02:09:59,570
Hopefully it's low enough,
but this is a max exodus.

2464
02:09:59,630 --> 02:10:04,580
Everybody's leaving in droves right now.
My dudes have a blessing.

2465

Beautiful Friday.
Happy weekend.

2466
02:10:08,210 --> 02:10:10,700
You know what?
Life is a challenge.

2467
02:10:11,150 --> 02:10:13,670
It's rough,
but if you listen closely,

2468
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:17,200
the music is playing to merit

2469
02:10:18,210 --> 02:10:19,043
sweet.
It's so full and it's out there to do 

2470
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:23,410
out there.
You just got to listen to it.
