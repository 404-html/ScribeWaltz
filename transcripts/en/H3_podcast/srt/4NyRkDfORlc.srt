23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,460

You've got your new movie coming out.

The NCAA,
there's a lot going on for the great 

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,230
bill burr,
but Madison Square Garden.

29
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:19,280
That's crazy.
Is that your,

30
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:20,780
have you played that venue before?

31
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,800
Yeah,
one of the time.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,060
Uh,
I forget one.

33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,970
Uh,
2015 I played it.

34
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,860
Mm.
So now back.

35
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,190
And uh,
hopefully just as good,

36
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,900
if not better than the last time.

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,770
How does it feel?
Cause that there's like almost 21,000

38
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:37,890
seats.
None.

39
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,710
How does it feel playing to that many 
people?

40
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:42,350
Verse like 200 People in Comedy Club?
It depends on how see

41
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,640
it like,
so when I did it,

42
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:44,474
I had the stage onto one side,
but now this time I'm doing it in the 

43
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:48,130
round so it's more seats.
I don't know how,

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,050
I don't know how many it is,
but uh,

45
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,170
it's,
you know,

46
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,540
what I did the first time was I ended 
up,

47
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,620
um,
you know,

48
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:01,700
cause I'm a big Zeplin fan and a song 
remains the same.

49
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:03,200
You know,
the concert film was shot there,

50
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,034
so I played drums.
So me and the guys from the Goddamn 

51
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:08,510
comedy jam,
Josh,

52
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:11,000
Adam Meyers and all those guys,
Ben Bailey came down,

53
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,863
my publicist played drums.
We all just in the ld arena just jammed 

54
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,050
and all these guns and roses and rock 
songs that we grew up with.

55
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,650
Then it was fun.
It turned it into like sort of like a,

56
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:24,980
um,
it felt like a more like,

57
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:25,491
uh,
like,

58
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:26,450
uh,
you know,

59
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,010
our clubhouse for the day.

60
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,310
And uh,
yeah,

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,173
you went in,
you made a lot of noise and then it 

62
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,580
didn't,
it didn't seem as crazy.

63
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,490
So I went out there and Paul versey 
opened and then Joe Derosa was on,

64
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,190
Joe had this old sort of what I was 
calling it,

65
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,980
a golden girl's sweater on.
So I w I just made fun of that,

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,390
you know,
keep going,

67
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,223
you know,
Paul Verhoeven and Joe to rose with his 

68
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:52,970
fucking golden girls sweater.
Just made me feel like I was at a comedy

69
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:53,620
club,
you know?

70
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,453
Hmm.
And then I had nervous fan at first 

71
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:56,991
show.
I was like,

72
00:02:56,991 --> 00:02:58,340
that's still,
you know,

73
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,223
like,
I mean I get more like I want people to 

74
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,630
feel like they got their money's worth.
Like I want people to leave.

75
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,490
Like you feel like,
uh,

76
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,490
like nervousness and all that is,
is on the way up.

77
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:10,990
And then once you get to a certain 
level,

78
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,120
then it becomes like responsibility.

79
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,720
Like these people spent their hard 
earned money coming out.

80
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,303
Yeah.
To get a sitter and it's not like they 

81
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:21,130
just went to a comedy club,
hey,

82
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,370
let's watch 10 comics and maybe a couple
of drinks.

83
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,390
Yeah,
I have a couple of,

84
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,540
yeah,
this is like,

85
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,330
this is an event.
So now the pressure in that,

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,290
uh,
no,

87
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,540
I mean,
I mean it's,

88
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,920
it would be a lot of pressure if I had 
to do like math,

89
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,530
like something I wasn't good at,
but it's like,

90
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:40,720
this is what I do.
They're coming to see me.

91
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,920
I mean,
you could do a podcast there.

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,800
No,
no,

93
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,730
you'd be fine.
Well,

94
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,530
I guess you're not in front of a crowd,
but whatever,

95
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,790
you know what I mean?
If you went to the,

96
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:52,060
to whatever comic con podcasting,
would you be nervous?

97
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,450
Yes.
All right.

98
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,710
Well [inaudible] nervous.
Got,

99
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,770
I'm so neurotic.

100
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,150
I am nervous.
I'm nervous right now.

101
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,170
Okay.
Very nervous.

102
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,830
I don't think about that and help build 
trust.

103
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,080
I'm well,
I'm on the edge.

104
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,130
Was there a relaxed thank you God.
Okay.

105
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,053
Keep it together.
Was there a point when you kind of pick 

106
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:15,130
a,
certainly you felt nervousness sometime?

107
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:15,941
Oh No.
Yeah,

108
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:19,540
the first eight years of my career,
I mean I would be like,

109
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,420
I'd do a 10 minute spot and then on 
nights where it was a difficult crowd in

110
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,254
New York,
I would be out of breath and sweating 

111
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:25,324
really 12 minutes.
I was telling jokes and it would be 

112
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,990
sweaty show.
Yeah,

113
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,361
no,
no,

114
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:29,670
no,
no.

115
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,150
I had on,
I had all these rituals.

116
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:31,984
I this referral for years where before I
went on stage I would untie and then 

117
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,404
retire my shoes cause I always worried 
what if they came on time and I did a 

118
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:39,544
face plant.

119
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,890
Oh wait,
I have,

120
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,250
should have that kind of OCD shit.
It drives me crazy.

121
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,540
I don't know if that's OCD,
but,

122
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,780
well,
I depends on what your childhood was.

123
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,643
I mean,
if you had a childhood and you weren't 

124
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,110
bullied at all and you still think like 
that,

125
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:55,570
I would think it was some sort of ocd,
but you know,

126
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,600
he got kicked out of yours for a while 
ago.

127
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,030
So city you're kind of looking at,
oh,

128
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:01,740
your Z.
I don't know.

129
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,340
I'm not going to diagnose you.
I have no idea.

130
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,740
Yeah.
So in my case it was probably just,

131
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,574
you know,
my childhood or whatever and it's just 

132
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:07,871
like,
oh,

133
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:09,610
you got bullied as a kid.
Yeah.

134
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,840
Oh,
both.

135
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,370
I did bully I,
you know,

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,233
it was,
yeah,

137
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,610
get it off of me and I'd pick on 
somebody weaker than me.

138
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:18,070
You know,
it was the Lord of the flies back then.

139
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,980
So it wasn't the way it is now where,
um,

140
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,980
you know,
you can go on Youtube and the next thing

141
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:25,630
you know,
the bullies crying for some reason.

142
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,464
Like,
I feel like bullies almost important in 

143
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:31,781
a way,
isn't it?

144
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,780
Like you got to allow kids to give each 
other shit in a sense.

145
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,940
I mean you can't call it a kids too 
much.

146
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,880
I don't think as a parent you ever allow
it?

147
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,860
Sure.
You know it's,

148
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:45,130
it's something though.
But I mean I know that there's like a,

149
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,640
like I have a daughter,
I want her to take some mma and I,

150
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:54,160
I just think all women should know that 
because I feel like rapists,

151
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,500
you know,
depending on how well they're in doubt,

152
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,370
at some point they're going to have to 
get in close.

153
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,570
And I feel like no one killer.
Yeah.

154
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,351
I mean,
yeah,

155
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,184
it's like,
I would think like when you watch those 

156
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:10,400
women fighting in the UFC,
it's just like this,

157
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,060
I mean this probably,
I mean I would think what I have,

158
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,913
what percentage of the population of 
just guys that even know how to fight 

159
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,003
sure could beat them and like I don't 
think they could because the second you 

160
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:23,520
get close to him and he's a professional
level fighters,

161
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:26,990
so if I'm,
the average woman would learn that.

162
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,310
I mean,
you could get them in a triangle.

163
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,900
The arms are,
when I said the armed guard,

164
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,410
I'm trying to remember all this stuff.
Rogan says like,

165
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:32,940
I don't,
I don't,

166
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,270
I don't,
I'm not educated in it,

167
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:35,104
but I just know looking at it that you 
just like learn a little self defense 

168
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,480
just enough that you can be on your back
and be in a powerful position.

169
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,870
And I just figured like a guy's going to
try to gorillas weigh in and try to hold

170
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:48,520
you down or whatever.
And then all of a sudden he's,

171
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,630
you know,
he's tapping out,

172
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:50,464
you blow out his elbow and,
and that's an erection killer right 

173
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:53,710
there,
man.

174
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,710
You blow up the elbow as it,
I think that's slang for the arm bar.

175
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,380
See yet that's part of,
I feel like that's a new thing.

176
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:10,090
You're already worried about your 
daughter being sexually assaulted.

177
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,350
You know,
how old is your daughter?

178
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:12,184
I don't think that is,
I think that's you projecting your ocd 

179
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:18,070
on me.
It's all we you're talking about,

180
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,240
you know,
you want your,

181
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,810
your two year old daughter to get Krav 
mcgraw so she could knife a dude's neck.

182
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,520
Yeah.
But I mean it's like,

183
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,880
it's not like,
you know,

184
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:26,714
that didn't exist.
It was like sexual assault started in 

185
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:30,560
2014.
I mean like,

186
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:34,040
stuff like that is about what has always
happened and uh,

187
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,151
and then also,
you know,

188
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:38,110
it gives you like confidence and it 
really is all you gotta do.

189
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,070
You know,
there was elementary,

190
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:42,620
middle,
and in high school and you know,

191
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,413
I feel like somewhere in junior high you
just had to have one fight and fight 

192
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:49,270
back and then it was like prison and was
like,

193
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:49,820
oh,
I don't,

194
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,960
you know,
he's going to be a problem.

195
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,630
And then they would just move on.
And then the kids who never fought back,

196
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,390
um,
it's,

197
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,520
it's,
they just have these horrible variances.

198
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,590
Um,
so I dunno,

199
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,191
I just,
you know,

200
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,300
it's just one of those things,
you know,

201
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,220
as a parent,
I guess what I meant is like,

202
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:05,054
now that you're a parent,
you thinking about things differently 

203
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,350
possibly and with kids and with your 
daughter,

204
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,520
I mean,
how has that changed?

205
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,090
I would say I am applying the things I 
always thought about because I,

206
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,200
I've,
because for all these years of not being

207
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:18,210
a parent,
I would watch parents,

208
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,793
you know,
dressing their kids in certain ways and 

209
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:23,550
I would just be like,
how do you not see that?

210
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,520
That is that the shit that that kid's 
gonna get,

211
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,190
get it right.
You know what I mean?

212
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:30,370
And it's just like for the love of God,
can you give them a fighting chance?

213
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,430
Yeah.
So like,

214
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:34,530
um,
yeah,

215
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:35,160
I,
I,

216
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,050
I,
I think you,

217
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:37,711
you,
when you grow up,

218
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:38,544
you become one and you either completely
forget your childhood or you have a 

219
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:41,760
pretty vivid,
hmm.

220
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,150
Murray of it and I,
you know,

221
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:45,040
it's most,
most of my channel is positive.

222
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,620
That's an interesting observation.
Yeah.

223
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,830
I feel like I forgot most of it.
That means it probably had a decent one.

224
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,500
Right.
Or the good ones,

225
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,440
the one you forget.
No,

226
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,590
no,
because I had,

227
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:57,840
I had no good in a bit.
I don't know.

228
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,820
I don't,
I don't know what though.

229
00:08:58,821 --> 00:08:59,654
I'm not a psychologist,
but I just think like the people I've 

230
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:01,734
talked to,
they either like remember everything or 

231
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,620
it's just like,
dude,

232
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:05,940
that was a long time ago,
man,

233
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,433
I don't remember.
So I think if you don't remember and 

234
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,910
then you have a kid,
you know,

235
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:14,220
I wouldn't want,
I would rather be the kid and the parent

236
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,410
that remembers.
Right.

237
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,473
So how do you forget my mother said the 
forties actually was kind of 

238
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,370
heartbreaking.
We don't,

239
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,590
my daughter is only a year and a half 
and she was going,

240
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I just really enjoy these first three,
four years as she got,

241
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:29,054
she goes really enjoying before they go 
to school and you know the kids ruin 

242
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:32,244
them.

243
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,533
Like wow.
That's like one of the funniest and 

244
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,900
saddest things you ever said button.
And then I was thinking like,

245
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:43,140
why did she think I was ruined?
And I probably was on some level.

246
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,470
That's an interesting that she 
remembered that after all these years.

247
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,810
Well because he came home from school 
ruined.

248
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,683
Yeah.
But just going to send your kids to 

249
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:51,444
school with,
with people who have kids that they're 

250
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:53,544
not actively involved in their life.
And so then the kids acting out and 

251
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:57,864
there they,
the kids on his way to becoming a 

252
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:03,600
problem and then your kid sees that 
behavior starts to mimic it.

253
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,141
Like I,
you know,

254
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:06,710
a lot of my friends obviously have kids 
that are older and they just,

255
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,563
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

256
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,870
Like it's just kids that are just,
uh,

257
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,270
you know,
the key is not to get mad at the kid.

258
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:15,690
You got to get mad at the parents know 
if you ever want to punch the kid,

259
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:16,740
you don't do that.
Right.

260
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,780
Don't punch the parent.
Punched the,

261
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,390
when dog I,
I'll give you a tee shirt.

262
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:22,224
I just got that.

263
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,730
But yeah,
I mean I say we dogs now because we have

264
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:29,370
a dog and we go to a dog park a lot and 
things like that.

265
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,290
And like it's always the owner.
The owner is not always,

266
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,130
but sometimes,
yeah,

267
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,360
sometimes.
But I mean,

268
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,194
I dunno because dogs,
I feel like there's this pure sweet 

269
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:42,960
souls for the most part.
And they have to be fucked up kind of by

270
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:46,320
the owner to be really or dangerous 
animals.

271
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,183
There's the dogs that nature says no to,
but people say yes to because it's 

272
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:51,960
adorable.
And then you like the mother just,

273
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,320
there's an inherently knows that there's
something fucked up with the dog,

274
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,930
kicks it away and the thing's going to 
starve to death.

275
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,720
And that's too heartbreaking as a human 
being in a dog lover to watch.

276
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,570
Okay,
so you give it the bottle and like,

277
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:03,404
you know,
then one day you see it's got one red 

278
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:07,200
eye and the other he got the terminator.

279
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,180
Well,
you're talking about like an adopted dog

280
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:12,330
or like a getting a puppy because I feel
like when you adopted dog,

281
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,980
you definitely throw the dice a little 
bit,

282
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,450
you know?
Um,

283
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,313
I had a rescue dog so that,
that was the other pit bull that was my 

284
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:21,990
experience yet.
And we ended up having to find her a new

285
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:24,270
home.
And fortunately it worked out,

286
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:27,000
but she was a human aggressive as they 
say.

287
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,973
I spent thousands of dollars trainers 
and all this types of things like my 

288
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,124
trainer.
And it ended up taking her and it has 

289
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:37,620
been like the challenge,
I think of his dog curry.

290
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,500
One of the trainer adopted the dog.
Yeah.

291
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:41,710
It took incredible.
Yeah.

292
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,691
Yeah.
Has He,

293
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:45,090
Ted's,
he managed to tame the animal.

294
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:48,040
Now he's been working with her for two 
years and she,

295
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,130
she's a,
for the first time in her life,

296
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,690
has another dog friend.

297
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,340
But he was the one who said,
you know,

298
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,320
this is one of these dogs.
Nature said no to,

299
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,310
but people said yes.
He goes,

300
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,010
I'm thinking that that's what it is.
But she's an absolute,

301
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,580
she's one of those people,
like if she was just abandoned again and

302
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:06,130
then came in here and then met the three
of us once,

303
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,053
she'd be all timid.
And once she saw that we were cool and 

304
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:12,190
we're going to,
once you fed her and protecting her,

305
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,350
she loved you and she almost love to 
hard.

306
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,030
Right,
right.

307
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,863
So then,
and then she would treat everybody else 

308
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:18,610
who came through that door.
Yeah.

309
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:21,880
Like they were an ax murderer and we 
would just never,

310
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:23,680
I mean,
so I had all these things I used to,

311
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,450
uh,
one of my buddies,

312
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:26,284
a forest,
we used to just go on hikes and it took 

313
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,880
forever and ever and ever and ever and 
ever.

314
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,713
But he was really good with animals and 
she ended up accepting him and it was 

315
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:37,300
the longest,
you know,

316
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,460
and I had to do all like come back to 
the house and just,

317
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,900
just have him,
you know,

318
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:41,734
stop at the gate.
And then it was a little bit behind the 

319
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:45,890
gate and then up to the front door.
And then,

320
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,020
and then there was all the,
him walking in first and just any little

321
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:52,930
thing could cause like a setback.
And it was,

322
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:53,980
uh,
it was,

323
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,250
you know,
it was emotionally draining.

324
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

325
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,070
I mean,
yeah,

326
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:00,904
she ended up buying one of my friends.
I always keep thinking of that Mama and 

327
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:05,130
she raced Adam.
There was a pocket,

328
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,030
I should have kicked it because he was 
so,

329
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,670
she was on like a hardwood floor.
I went and knocked her down,

330
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:11,150
you know,
he would've been just fine.

331
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,940
Was he her?
No,

332
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:16,120
she barely,
cause she hadn't done that before so she

333
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:16,570
didn't,
but,

334
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,570
but how it works is at first they go to 
the feet,

335
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,433
then they go higher and each time as 
they build up and then it's fight and 

336
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:25,020
then grab it.
And it just,

337
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,043
you know,
it's sort of like an escalating like 

338
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:30,010
alcoholic.
Um,

339
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,990
I mean I'm talking kind of,
you know,

340
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,033
I don't really know a lot of this stuff 
and there'd be a bunch of people right 

341
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:36,454
now.
So I'm just talking about what my 

342
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:39,664
experience was.
I'm not saying I know everything about 

343
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:41,644
dogs,
so,

344
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,903
but that's,
that's kind of I was afraid to adopt 

345
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:45,820
because you just never know what you're 
going to get.

346
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:47,740
And people give a shit.
Cause we bought,

347
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,330
we bought a dog.
We wanted,

348
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,060
we wanted a purebred puppy or not a pure
bed,

349
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,130
but we really liked the Maltese and the 
Yorkies.

350
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,520
We have a friend who had to military,
so,

351
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,240
and we really liked them,
so we were like,

352
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,140
so we've got a file.
Can got a falcon.

353
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,370
That's the only thing.
Multisite.

354
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:04,690
No.
Oh it was a maltese.

355
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,490
Just a little fluffy white dog.
Oh,

356
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,353
it's a little toy dog that you can pet,
but we get so much shit for having 

357
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,890
bought a dog,
but it's like,

358
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,680
you know,
you throw the dice when you,

359
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:18,790
you don't know what these dogs at the 
pound has been through.

360
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,571
You know,
it's like,

361
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:20,370
uh,
I mean,

362
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,500
were you supposed to do just what was 
supposed to have a puppy mill ones?

363
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,363
These dogs need to be a Bot.
Somebody's got to take care of these 

364
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:27,671
dogs.
I mean,

365
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:28,504
you need to,
you need to know what you're doing when 

366
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:32,050
you can get a rescue to train them.
Right?

367
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,943
I mean,
I don't,

368
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,960
yeah,
for me,

369
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,630
for me it's my first dog,
so I don't want to gamble too my chin.

370
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,870
But it's because it feels like you,
like when you're walking down the street

371
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:45,250
with him and people be like,
Oh,

372
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,040
where'd you get him?
And you didn't buy that dog.

373
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:48,874
You,
it's like,

374
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,860
if you care that much,
sorry,

375
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,023
this is something that bothers me.
If you care that much about adopting 

376
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:58,280
dogs,
how can you have a kid?

377
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,650
You got to adopt kid,
right?

378
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,513
There's kids out there that need a home.
How dare you have a kid of your own if 

379
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:07,280
you're not going to adopt first heard,
same logic.

380
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,840
It's basically a puppy mill.
Yeah,

381
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,110
I agree with that.
Thanks.

382
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,590
I got,
I got bills and toys to map.

383
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,430
My theory has been,
if I was in your situation,

384
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:18,440
I would just annoy the shit out of 
people.

385
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,520
I would call volunteer it.
Well,

386
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,980
I got an a thought.
If you're a Brit mean.

387
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,933
Yeah,
it was like the least sick we looking 

388
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,160
one.

389
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,030
Yeah,
I figured I'd get that one.

390
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,290
Yeah,
I love that.

391
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,060
Yeah,
you just steer into it.

392
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,680
I love that.
I need,

393
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:36,800
that's why I was,
I was over in France and like I'm trying

394
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:39,260
to learn how to speak French.
I have been bad with it,

395
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:41,300
but like when I would go over there,
you know,

396
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,340
if you stink,
they just start speaking English.

397
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,420
And I was just like,
well,

398
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,254
if I get to listen to the English,
you're listening to my French and I 

399
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:49,430
would just torture him with it and I 
would not switch over.

400
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:53,030
And it'd be like,
I speak English and I speak French.

401
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:54,620
I speak French.
Okay.

402
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,370
This is the situation or the smart way 
to do it.

403
00:15:58,371 --> 00:15:59,930
That's the way to learn.
Yeah.

404
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:01,430
What else am I going to learn?
You know,

405
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:02,264
I lived in Israel with Isla for five 
years and I succumbed because every 

406
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,040
time,
you know,

407
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,521
they're like,
oh,

408
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:09,470
this idiot American,
I'm gonna speak English to them.

409
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,110
And I succumbed,
I didn't steer in.

410
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,360
I wish I steered it.
You got to,

411
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,194
you got to get into the comedy of it.
Just fortunately them with their own 

412
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:18,230
language.
It's really funny.

413
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,240
They maybe look at immigrants 
differently,

414
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:20,810
like,
uh,

415
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,040
but I guess it immigrants,
it's worse.

416
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,780
It's worse because they're actually 
staying,

417
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,060
you know what I mean?
So I would be like,

418
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,340
I would be like the fact that I'm going 
to be there for 10 days.

419
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:29,174
I'm not trying to get employed,
kind of give a fuck and I just have a 

420
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:33,050
good time.
Um,

421
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,420
I don't know.
I had a great time at a great time doing

422
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:37,910
that.
I need to get a shirt that says I bought

423
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:40,460
this dog.
Yeah.

424
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,200
So you probably never spent much time at
a dog park because there's a whole thing

425
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:46,034
there,
but it sounds like your dog would have 

426
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,350
just gone on a rampage there.

427
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,183
Probably she was all right initially,
but then once she sort of bonded with 

428
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,210
us,
then it became a problem.

429
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,050
So no,
we stay,

430
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:56,510
I stayed away from there and then,
then everybody else who watches like the

431
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:57,344
dog whisperer in that and then they 
tried to be the guy running the 

432
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:00,890
shirtless up.
Yeah,

433
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,540
everybody does it.
They didn't even know what it is.

434
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,570
See if you would've stayed through that.
I did that for a while.

435
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:09,950
Like the magic was making that noise and
it's just like,

436
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:12,910
no,
this guy's been working Walcott ever.

437
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,873
Does he even know anything?
I also wonder does he just pretend like 

438
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:19,070
he knows and then we believe him.
You know what I mean?

439
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,690
I don't know.
I mean you're right.

440
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,310
You're really,
I mean he's doing this.

441
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,720
I mean how much,
what does that do?

442
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,060
Well I think the guy knows what he's 
doing.

443
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,800
Okay.
He got a TV show.

444
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,693
There's people he did,
but he worked with a lot of famous 

445
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,700
people's dogs.
No famous people got eaten by dogs.

446
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,240
So I would say some level nuts.
Yeah.

447
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,300
Yeah.
You're really cynical guide man.

448
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,640
That is a lot for me to say that I'm 
cynical either the bill birth yet,

449
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,320
but you're not,
you know what you're not,

450
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:49,154
it's going to close.
People think like I listen to your 

451
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:52,590
podcasts a lot and you are,
you're a very optimistic,

452
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:53,424
fair guy.
There's like a real fairness behind 

453
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,853
everything you say.
It's nice to be listened to every once 

454
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,100
everybody else go.
Like you know,

455
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,970
he's the king.
I'll rage common.

456
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,850
I think cap guns.
Cause you know,

457
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:05,040
I used to be a redhead before it left 
me,

458
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,680
but I still have the red beard.
There's just something about like,

459
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,900
you can sort of openly say that redheads
or the child,

460
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,830
children of Satan and that's,
that's totally fell all good.

461
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,570
It's all good.
Kick of Ginger Day.

462
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,760
All that fucking that bother you though.
Like for real,

463
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,520
all the data and does it,
it just,

464
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:20,354
it,
it's freeing because then I don't have 

465
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:23,760
to care about whatever you're crying 
about.

466
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,920
And particularly white women complaining
about how difficult it is to live in the

467
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,960
United States of America.
This is hilarious.

468
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,940
You know what I mean?
I mean look,

469
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:35,460
if you some hillbilly living on a dirt 
trail then yeah.

470
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,500
Okay.
I would feel bad for you.

471
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:39,930
But like other than that,
you have,

472
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,823
you have,
you know,

473
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,570
pretty much having red hair.
No,

474
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:42,900
no.
It's,

475
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,030
it's just more like,
uh,

476
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,280
not have red hair thing is,
it's a myth dude.

477
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,650
I did great too when I was single.
I did great.

478
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,300
No,
it was confident.

479
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,690
I was funny girls.
I did fine.

480
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,580
But this whole fucking thing that I was 
like over,

481
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,400
over the corner,
um,

482
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,350
I mean it's suck when I was growing up.
Yeah,

483
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:02,184
definitely.
Cause it's like you got a bullseye on 

484
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,740
top of your head.
So,

485
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:07,380
but I feel like I,
you know,

486
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,720
I always joke with people,
if I had like brown hair,

487
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:11,130
I wouldn't even be in this fucking 
business.

488
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:11,963
That's great.
I don't think it would be funny and I 

489
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:15,900
think I wouldn't be be,
you know,

490
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,070
just doing some big cog in a wheel 
somewhere then a dental,

491
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:20,963
uh,
dentist possibly as your father before 

492
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:25,080
you write your dental assistant.
Yes.

493
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,180
That's interesting.
Well,

494
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:28,014
I mean it's not that interesting.
It's interesting if my dad wasn't a 

495
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:30,624
dentist when,
right.

496
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,040
It's like,
well,

497
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,730
did you have ever plans,
like before you got into comedy,

498
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,453
what,
at what point did you decide you wanted 

499
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:40,980
to get a comedy when you were doing like
dental assisting?

500
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:43,530
Or was that just kind of,
you always knew you wanted the job?

501
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,740
I needed a job and I got fired,
uh,

502
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,210
from this warehouse because,
uh,

503
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,670
it was this,
this fat guy who was running,

504
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:55,310
she was from the carpeted area.
Right.

505
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:56,144
And he used to come out,
you know like the typical Douche who 

506
00:19:59,091 --> 00:20:01,350
could like just gets a little bit of 
power and it just,

507
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:04,170
I don't know why and then they just go 
pure evil,

508
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,880
pure evil.

509
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,713
But he just,
he just walked out there like he had 

510
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:08,904
accomplished something like,
I don't know what like he had like an 

511
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:13,470
astronaut sort of gait the way he was 
walking.

512
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,950
So he used to come out there and 
everybody would seem common and then try

513
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:17,784
to like work it,
oh look at me cutting up the box and 

514
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:20,461
look at me,
you know,

515
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:22,840
doing this shit.
And I just met [inaudible].

516
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,180
I was like,
fuck this guy.

517
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,520
So I wouldn't do that.
And if anything I would,

518
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:28,770
I would step off the gas a little bit.
But yeah,

519
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:29,940
it was up man.
Damn,

520
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,670
I didn't do that.
What do you get the,

521
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:36,360
where do you like it was self sabotage 
because I have no other option.

522
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,470
I feel like everyone wishes they had 
that right there where you're like,

523
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:41,550
you know what?
Fuck this guy.

524
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,600
I'm going to work less.

525
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,860
I don't have that in me.
That has loved it,

526
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,100
but that has to be applied correctly.
Right.

527
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,260
Cause it'll stop your life.
You need to work as a team.

528
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,780
There's a plane crash and maybe we 
should go this way.

529
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:54,620
And I've gone,
oh no,

530
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,340
it was just cuff sucker lead me out of 
the woods.

531
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,313
But like not fuck everyone.
It's fuck these guys that don't deserve 

532
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,140
my respect.
Well,

533
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:05,620
yeah.
So I didn't work as hard and then I,

534
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,783
and I was due for raise it and then I 
asked for a raise and then magically I 

535
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:12,700
got laid off and the economy was bad and
I couldn't get a job.

536
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,070
And uh,
I needed,

537
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:17,200
one of my dad was like,
well why don't you come work with me for

538
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:18,640
a little bit?
And I did and it,

539
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,260
and it was,
it was great cause I got,

540
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:21,094
I got,
I worked with him for five years and it 

541
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,080
went wow.

542
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,010
And I got to a sort of,
you know,

543
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,800
by not seeing my dad,
just seeing him as a dentist,

544
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:31,790
like I kind of got to figure him out,
um,

545
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,090
and understand them more.
So it was a great thing.

546
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:38,040
And then also I learned so much about,
you know,

547
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,660
teeth and all of the headaches that he 
can cause uh,

548
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,933
yeah,
I don't think I'd still take x rays 

549
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,760
because they switched up the machinery 
so long go since when I did it.

550
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:50,650
But I could still take impressions,
pour 'em up.

551
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:51,484
I still don't have the old school way.
We tap on that vibrating thing to get 

552
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:55,654
all the apples out of it.
It's nothing worse than if there was a 

553
00:21:58,031 --> 00:21:58,864
fall because the bubble would,
they always seem to go down to the 

554
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:01,474
bottom.
So it then another one would always be 

555
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:03,514
right where the tooth was and then like 
the bubble wouldn't take the w would 

556
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,180
kill that impression.

557
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,250
Uh,
that part of it.

558
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:11,760
And you'd have to talk about when you 
put like the clay in someone's mouth.

559
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:12,594
Yeah.
And then you can't just report because 

560
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:15,420
the,
the,

561
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,253
the,
that gunk shrinks and then you have to 

562
00:22:17,891 --> 00:22:20,170
Redo it.
And then if you had a gagger and you had

563
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,004
to read it,
and I will fucking guy I puked at the 

564
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:23,540
dentist when they took her.
Yeah.

565
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,840
I was a gagger man.
Broke my heart.

566
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,680
One of those bubbles popped in my mold.
Yeah.

567
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,190
There was just like,
I used to just,

568
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,320
what are the kinds of crazy shit you 
deal as a,

569
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,860
you ever getting people's mouths or were
you just on Stan?

570
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,703
Yeah,
it took out the stitches and that was 

571
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:40,090
certified to take x rays and uh,
yeah,

572
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:42,550
it was about the extent of it.
So when did that,

573
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,610
and then did an end when you started 
doing comedy?

574
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,140
No,
I was doing,

575
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,790
I was doing dates and I was,
and it was hilarious.

576
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,380
My Dad,
you know,

577
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:55,900
back then he had like,
he worked from seven to seven.

578
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:58,030
I never saw anybody.
We had a 7:00

579
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,300
AM patient used to work on like,
like prisoners,

580
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,340
people in the correctional thing,
cops.

581
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,210
He would work out.
Yeah.

582
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:07,180
He like,
he was like a force of nature.

583
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,763
Like he did the work of three dentists.
So I wanted to work with the other 

584
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:14,320
dentists because it was just like I 
could actually get a lunch.

585
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:15,154
We used to police to numb people up.
I'd be numb people up and then race out 

586
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
while they were getting numb.
And just wolf down slice of pizza.

587
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,070
Oh,
you'd be on your feet.

588
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,270
The whole day is just like,
no,

589
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:26,104
I got my work ethic.
Both my parents worked extremely hard 

590
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,940
their whole lives.
I mean,

591
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:34,000
they're older now,
so they're retired and stuff,

592
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:34,990
but like,
uh,

593
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,820
but just watching how hard they worked 
and I think that that is one of the main

594
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:43,810
reasons why I got this gig coming up in 
New York was,

595
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,240
um,
you know,

596
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:47,680
it was a combination of,
of learning.

597
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:48,514
That's what working is.
And then coming up in the Boston comedy 

598
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:54,880
scene where like what was considered 
killing there.

599
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,913
MMM.

600
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,790
You know,
what was considered just getting the job

601
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,370
done was killing and some of these other
cities that I went to,

602
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:04,340
but like they're,
so it was just laying in grounds.

603
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:04,941
Yeah,
no,

604
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,910
they murdered,
it was a guy,

605
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,560
Kevin Knox,
rest his soul.

606
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,540
He used to host the show and uh,
patrice rest his soul.

607
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,280
He used to say,
uh,

608
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,780
Kevin doesn't host a show as much as he 
just like,

609
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,633
takes breaks from killing.
So he would like murder and then you 

610
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:21,534
would,
and we used to compare it to like a 

611
00:24:22,471 --> 00:24:24,840
giant wave.
You'd get up there and just find a ride.

612
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,063
And he really took it personally,
if you bombed on his show because he 

613
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,430
felt like the crowd looked at him like,
Kev,

614
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,710
you fucked us.
Like who was like,

615
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,573
like he took it personally responsible.
Like he was the GM putting together a 

616
00:24:38,581 --> 00:24:39,630
championship team.

617
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,670
So,
and we used to tell horror stories about

618
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:42,504
having to follow,
which you have to follow with star trek 

619
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:46,680
bid or is drunk driving bid.
And they were just all,

620
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,530
they all murdered.
And um,

621
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:50,730
so yeah,
it was probably,

622
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,100
you know,
that whole thing.

623
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:58,101
So I have a very low level of patience 
for people that dog it at their jobs.

624
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:00,930
And I don't give a fuck if you hate your
job,

625
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,290
just going in there and just not doing a
good job.

626
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,540
It's just like,
I just,

627
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:06,374
just like then Quinn,
but like don't make everybody else 

628
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,980
around you suffer.
Like it's,

629
00:25:10,981 --> 00:25:12,540
it's Kinda like,
it's bullshit.

630
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,360
Like you signed up to do this job,
do the fucking job.

631
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,860
And,
um,

632
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,790
and I really don't have any sympathy for
people who don't work hard and,

633
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:21,624
uh,

634
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,810
okay.

635
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,643
You know,
and they're not getting where they want 

636
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:24,874
to be in life.
If you're making an effort and you're 

637
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:27,460
still getting fucked and that's like 
somebody,

638
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:29,530
I'll try to help out.
But like if you're just like

639
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,500
not putting in every minute

640
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,633
yeah.
You're fucking over the person you're 

641
00:25:33,421 --> 00:25:37,290
currently working for and then ask him 
like where your brass ring is.

642
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:37,831
It's like,
well,

643
00:25:37,831 --> 00:25:40,290
I mean,
that's not how the world works.

644
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,330
What,
what is the C,

645
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:44,164
you've probably heard this a lot.
People say that dentists are like high 

646
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,160
rate of suicide.
What is,

647
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,840
is there something to that?
Have you heard that?

648
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,830
Okay.

649
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,461
Uh,
yeah,

650
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:54,870
I think everybody heard that growing up,
but I never knew when that true.

651
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,080
I've never known one that killed him.

652
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,480
Yeah.
Did you,

653
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,140
well,
it sounds like it was stressful,

654
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,350
but not suicidal.
Yeah,

655
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,430
obviously.
Yeah.

656
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,560
He never killed him yet.
He's,

657
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:06,394
he's,
if that's what you're asking to kill 

658
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:08,510
themselves,
it's just the oprah part.

659
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:10,010
Where you going to try to get me to cry?
Yeah.

660
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,620
Well,
I got nothing done about it one night.

661
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,310
I just thought that was interesting 
thing.

662
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:19,190
It's just one of those things you hear 
and you're just like accepted it on face

663
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:19,641
value.
You're like,

664
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:20,474
oh yeah,
dentists,

665
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,890
they're all killing themselves.
Yeah.

666
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,660
That was all of those things.
And that was the thing.

667
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,613
The guy who put the pack of firecrackers
in the kids back pocket and lit it and 

668
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,400
blew half his ass off.
And you never heard that one,

669
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:31,400
that these might be older ones before 
your guys' time.

670
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,920
But there was a,
there was these think candies called pop

671
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:34,754
rocks.

672
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,060
Oh yeah,
I know the pop box.

673
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,903
So the thing was somebody swelled a 
whole bag and his stomach exploded and 

674
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:40,024
he died.
Like all of those types of things 

675
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:43,470
existed.
So I don't know what the new ones are.

676
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,333
Right.
He was on his ipad and he fell asleep 

677
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,290
and he burned his face trying to update 
the technology.

678
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,970
That's a good one.
I think that's true actually.

679
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:52,710
I heard that.
Um,

680
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,633
so let's take a quick break.
We're going to go to a quick commercial 

681
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:57,210
break.
We got a lot to get to.

682
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,370
Am I coming back after the [inaudible] 
coming back?

683
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,880
Uh,
guys,

684
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:06,000
are you coming back after the break?
I certainly hope so as well.

685
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,103
Stay tuned.
Thank you to dollar Shave Club for

Now have you guys seen pulp fiction?

687
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,933
You know the scene at the end of that 
movie where he opens the briefcase and 

688
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,470
it's glowing gold and you don't know 
what's in it?

689
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,513

713
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:33,750

lavender body cleanser.

714

all their products.

715

Thank you to mint mobile for sponsoring 
us.

734
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,920
I love this product because phone lines 
are so ethic expensive.

735
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,913
It's ridiculous.
I remember when we lived in Israel and 

736
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:43,894
when we were dead broke,
there was a phone companies that were 

737
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:46,744
selling their product for like $10 a 
month and it saved our law like it's 

738
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,120
actually saved our life.
We were so broke and here if you want to

739
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:57,580
get a plan,
it's like a hundred fricking dollars.

740
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,670
It's insane.
So that's what I'm so happy to see meant

741
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:01,504
mobile because they are that disruptor 
that's given a good service at a fair 

742
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,790
price.
Okay,

743
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,580
now I want to read this coffee they've 
got cause it's hilarious.

744
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:10,414
There's sin in shouts out to the world.
The big and big wireless p stands for a 

745
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:16,540
lot of things,
big contracts,

746
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,110
big bills and big fees.
Oh,

747
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,513
what's up now?
Shots fired like eight t and t's new 

748
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,023
$800 million administrative fee 
increased meant mobile doesn't have 

749
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:32,410
around with any of that shit cause guess
what?

750
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,080
They cost just $15 a month.
Wow,

751
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,520
that's a game changer,
dude.

752
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,160
They make it so easy to cut your 
wireless bill down.

753
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,180
All they do is send you this card in the
mail and guess what?

754
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,440
You know what that is?
It's Sim card.

755
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:46,030
You plug in your phone,
Bob's your uncle,

756
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:47,650
$15 a month.
I'm telling you,

757
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,190
it changed my life when I had this 
opportunity in Israel.

758
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,120
Choose between two five 10 gigabyte,
four g lte plans,

759
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,180
no more paying for unlimited data that 
you don't even need.

760
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,640
Every plant comes with unlimited talk 
and text.

769

Guys meant mobile.com/h
three guys,

770
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:36,880
they are listening and they are watching
and this is not me being paranoid.

771
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,120
They're out there lurking,
ready to steal your data right now.

772
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,420
Who is they?
If you need to know who's they,

773
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,230
they are already ahead of you.
They the government,

774
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,153
the ISP,
the people sitting at the airport being 

775
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:50,801
like,
Oh,

776
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:55,030
free airport internet.
Cool time to steal your passport,

777
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,133
your credit card.
They Ila or all out there and they're 

778
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:04,471
praying on the weak lambs of the world.
That's why you need to get express vpn.

779
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,633
You're making online purchases are 
accessing your email to an unsecured 

780
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:14,650
network or even from home cause the ISP 
can see everything.

781
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,240
You're making a big mistake,
okay?

782
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,193
You were being tracked.
Expressed vpn has easy to use APP that 

783
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:22,690
runs seamlessly in the background of any
computer,

784
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,740
phone,
or tablet.

785
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,860
You turn on express vpn protection.
It takes one click,

786
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,080
boom,
protected you later.

787
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,410
Haters.
I was going to flip off the camera,

788
00:32:31,411 --> 00:32:34,450
but I thought maybe that's too obscene.
Um,

789
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,900
express vpn secures and anonymizes your 
Internet browsing history.

790
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,870
Everything that's going on,
encrypt your data.

791
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:46,130
Hide your public ip address.
You are set to go,

792
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,560
okay?
Forget about Hentai.

793
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,850
Okay?
We can live with anti.

794
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,250
The government doesn't care if you're 
watching the head or whatever it is.

795
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:53,084
Even weirder than that.
What I do care is that people don't get 

796
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:58,280
my credit card information.
Don't get my passport,

797
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,323
okay?
This is the kind of things that are 

798
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:01,814
important to keep secure.
I don't want to be another stat and 

799
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:11,531
facebook's advertising campaign or 
Russian propaganda machine,

We are back with the great,
great,

808
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,170
greatest bilborough.
I do mean that,

809
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,280
but I know it makes you uncomfortable,
but one great was bad enough.

810
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,193
Does it bite you?
But you know that I like being 

811
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:53,360
appreciated.
Yeah.

812
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,930
Okay.
Just say Tony,

813
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:58,570
that one with the person I appreciate.
Oh really?

814
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,740
Yes.
Back what?

815
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:01,180
He's worth the money.
Okay.

816
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,810
It's definitely worth the money guys.
Madison Square Garden.

817
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,180
Yeah.
What was that?

818
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:11,190
A November 7th and New York City guys.
Head on over to bill bird.com/events

819
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,280
and I do want to say,
guys,

820
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,230
you all have netflix.
I mean,

821
00:34:17,231 --> 00:34:18,064
everyone has netflix.
Statistically half of Americans maybe 

822
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,240
even more have netflix.
That's incredible,

823
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:23,074
right?
That means that everybody should be 

824
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:29,240
watching.
Episode fabric is for family saving.

825
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,093
More people have it considering how easy
it is to steal somebody's right 

826
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,193
password.
So I would say probably they don't care 

827
00:34:36,281 --> 00:34:37,390
about that.
That blows my mind.

828
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:42,070
I mean I think that's like this,
this gi level loss like it's,

829
00:34:42,071 --> 00:34:42,904
yeah,
but then we'll get them addicted to it 

830
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,943
someday.
Someday that relationships fail and 

831
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:47,544
they're only going to be halfway through
narcos and they can have to see the 

832
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:50,014
ending and then we'll get their account.
But like they were so ahead of the game 

833
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,600
because all these companies with 
passwords with access,

834
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,460
there are so tight ass about it.
They'd be like,

835
00:34:57,461 --> 00:34:58,294
Oh,
you can only log in to computers that 

836
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:02,170
wants netflix going back a decade said 
no.

837
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,960
Everyone on the block,
everybody,

838
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:07,930
you know can use your account and look 
at them now.

839
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:08,980
Who's fucking laughing?
No,

840
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,970
I guess they are.
F is for family guys.

841
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,250
Check it out and left.
And now I'm uh,

842
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,350
I want to show you some videos.
Okay.

843
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,603
I thought I would like,
I don't know if you're going to like 

844
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:20,680
this one.
This one,

845
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,390
I don't know.
Save.

846
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,340
It was risky but risky.
I don't know.

847
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:26,740
We'll see what you think.
This is the old classic.

848
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:29,620
You may have seen it.
You don't have to say anything.

849
00:35:29,621 --> 00:35:30,760
I just want you to enjoy it.

850
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,523
Okay.

851
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,070
Is that a move?
You know this is

852
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,180
us.
Check us out.

853
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
That was incredible.
You want to do that again?

854
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,000
That was like break dancing right there.
No,

855
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:45,834
that's a move.
That is absolutely his face got kind of 

856
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,800
probably kind of roughed up.
I think that's absolutely a move.

857
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,530
They face grind.
Watch him watch.

858
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:58,930
I'll control the is,
I don't know dude.

859
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,950
[inaudible] second you slide on your 
face.

860
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,040
You don't want to be,
your arms are going to flail.

861
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,063
He was just like,
well they have a different center about 

862
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,153
hockey snap.
Like if it's a move then that's all we 

863
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,150
knew is just watch his arms.
Watch his arms.

864
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,610
He was pushing to to try to get another,
I mean is the foot that they're ahead of

865
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:18,444
the game.
All right guys,

866
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,820
I want to see more of those.
Well,

867
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,410
I've never thought about it as it being 
a movie once again.

868
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,770
Great,
great.

869
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,830
Mine is.
I appreciate it very much.

870
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,113
That's just and move both the baseline.
So here I want to ask how nuts to the 

871
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:34,040
crowd go when he did that.
I mean it's still,

872
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,110
we got to the gate.
What are you going to go right?

873
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,020
I got plenty of little people are and 
what are you going to go there?

874
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,330
I got what you're finishing.
Why the face slide,

875
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,690
the face,
whatever you want to call it.

876
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,340
The Deli face.
Yeah,

877
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,363
exactly.
So I want to ask you about one of the 

878
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:55,090
great moments in your career or one of 
my favorite moments in your career.

879
00:36:55,091 --> 00:36:55,924
And then I,
I've always appreciated only with pop 

880
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:58,584
this up for reference for us,
the audience I want to ask you about 

881
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:01,704
Sherry's berries,
it ketchup going up and it's sweet 

882
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,520
holiday gift.
So you had a,

883
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,440
I'm just going to catch on one up.

884
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,273
You had a advertiser called Sherry's 
berries and while you were reading the 

885
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:14,470
copy you just,
you couldn't hold it together because it

886
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,480
was the first time reading the copy.
It was just so homophobic and homoerotic

887
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,550
if the same time that I just,
it was,

888
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,970
it was so silly,
I couldn't move.

889
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:25,980
It was actual cop and it's just so 
ridiculous.

890
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:29,010
The it like I've never heard anything 
like that being advertised.

891
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,010
Evidently they're delicious.
Still still make hot chocolate.

892
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,470
Yeah.
And they dropped me after awhile.

893
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:41,670
You know what happened was I had Harris 
Stanton was on and they was like,

894
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:43,800
we have strawberries,
you know,

895
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:44,940
drip,
you know,

896
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,700
dunked in white chocolate and then 
they've,

897
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,820
we have,
you know,

898
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,850
in dark chocolates like oil.
And I've just jokingly said to him,

899
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,780
he's black.
I said,

900
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,690
how come the white chocolate comes 
before this and that?

901
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,850
Then we started riffing on the Klan or 
something and then,

902
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:57,970
I dunno,
I dunno.

903
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,850
Then it was just two people can fit it 
off.

904
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:02,370
Strawberries are made by the clan.
I didn't know what they was saying.

905
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,950
Yeah.
I'm still sad they left.

906
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,680
I loved going share.
Yeah.

907
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,730
I mean Dude,
how many ads go viral?

908
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:13,740
I've been thinking about,
I've never bought cherries,

909
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:14,574
berries.
They told me to take this down and then 

910
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,810
cause I,
in the end I said,

911
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:20,550
you guys better buy this shit cause I'm 
gonna get in trouble.

912
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,850
And then people bought it and then they 
quickly were smart enough to be like,

913
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:24,541
okay,
leave it up,

914
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:25,374
leave it up.
And we had this really cool thing where 

915
00:38:26,361 --> 00:38:27,640
I felt like cherries,
beer,

916
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,613
they get me,
we won't happen if somebody new came in 

917
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:35,130
or maybe somebody saw black klansman.
Mm.

918
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,610
The,
the original cut of it.

919
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,180
Right.
You know,

920
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,330
before it came out.
Now I don't know what happened.

921
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,030
What do you love?
Or maybe I'm gonna say we listened to it

922
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:44,890
so many times.
It's like one of our,

923
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,450
oh thank you.
I love,

924
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,580
so let me,
let me update the,

925
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:50,400
the audience here with a little Sherry's
berries.

926
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,500
Yeah.

927
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,333
Well,
so have delicious products such as 

928
00:38:53,521 --> 00:38:54,354
Christmas cake pops,
cheese cakes and dip pretzels is the 

929
00:38:58,501 --> 00:38:59,334
only way to get this special.
1999 Sherry's berries offer call eight 

930
00:39:05,431 --> 00:39:10,431
six six fruit.
I'm sorry,

931
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,050
what the fuck am I?
So did I have proof of this?

932
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:22,860
This is fucking ridiculous.
Who the fuck is going to buy this shit?

933
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:29,810
100

934
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,140
fruit.
Yeah.

935
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,860
I love that so much.
So did they?

936
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:36,530
I W I really just wanted to know how did
they react to that.

937
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:41,110
But it sounds like they reacted like 
you'd have to be like laughing.

938
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,310
It's going to take it down.
Yeah.

939
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,550
And um,
well I have this thing on my part.

940
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,460
I never talked to the advertisers.
I never available.

941
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,590
And if like yeah,
either get what I do or you don't.

942
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:55,424
And I understand,
I understand if you don't want to be 

943
00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:58,970
associated with her,
my stupidity.

944
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,553
But if you do,
I think I can help you sell some stuff 

945
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:03,710
like the bear.
Well,

946
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:08,060
the thing is is people can fast forward 
through the ads so the show can't stop.

947
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:13,060
So you got it.
You got to do something to make a one.

948
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,210
I like on Howard Stern,
I love when he burps during the region.

949
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,623
It just,
it always makes me laugh and it always 

950
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:20,990
sounds like the same one like red stew 
in it.

951
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,910
But I,
uh,

952
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,133
it always makes me laugh whenever it's 
just something hilarious about somebody 

953
00:40:28,281 --> 00:40:31,910
burping while reading advertising.
So I actually look forward.

954
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,480
I look forward to is reads,
I look forward to your reason.

955
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:36,590
I love listening to your reads because,
well,

956
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:38,000
let me ask you this.
Do,

957
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,830
do you get in trouble a lot when you do 
read,

958
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,170
because a lot of your reads or like I 
was listening to your,

959
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,050
one of your recent podcasts,
you were talking about sports betting.

960
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:45,950
You're like,
I don't like,

961
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,023
I don't fucking sports cars.
They make you say like [inaudible] on 

962
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:51,491
his buds.
Like,

963
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:52,400
I don't,
I don't do this shit.

964
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,563
They'd be like,
words in your mouth maybe like you bet 

965
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,450
you when I'm like,
yeah,

966
00:40:56,451 --> 00:40:59,840
well you lose and your wife leaves you.
There's degrees.

967
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,100
So the sponsors get upset with your 
candidate.

968
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:04,963
No,
I think at this point that gets kind of 

969
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:06,170
been established.

970
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,600
This is what he does.
Good stuff.

971
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,900
Yeah.
So they'll just be like,

972
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,090
they like,
I haven't lost an Avatar,

973
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,953
I shouldn't say this,
but I haven't lost one in about three 

974
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:17,120
months.
Four months.

975
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,270
Yeah.
So that's been a good run.

976
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,600
That's good.
That's a good run.

977
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,160
Good one.
There's always like my favorite wine,

978
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:26,360
which are going to the hall of fame of 
the One and dones.

979
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,973
I'm trying to think who they were.
The only one I could ever remember is a 

980
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,850
box and I thought,
I thought,

981
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,690
I know what happens.
I thought it was nature's box,

982
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:37,430
like the best of it.
So I was like,

983
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:39,530
you going down on Mother Nature,
right?

984
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,090
Yeah.
So stupid.

985
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,643
As you're laughing,
I read another three lines of copy and 

986
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,280
you're getting information and they just
didn't see,

987
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:49,820
they didn't find the humor.
We had nature box.

988
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,770
I think they went under actually.
Yeah,

989
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,320
most stupid.
They're just like bringing,

990
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,163
we weren't,
we failed them do it bringing you a 

991
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:56,570
banana and it's just like,
well,

992
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:59,150
I mean I could fucking,
I can't do this yourself.

993
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,030
Like what they were offering,
it was just like hacks with snacks,

994
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,370
snacks,
snack.

995
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,620
You Take Guinness to 45 seconds out of 
your day.

996
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:07,454
You can probably do this yourself.
You ever get asked for make goods when 

997
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:11,330
you do ads?

998
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,091
What do you mean?
Like,

999
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:15,080
if I screwed,
they say,

1000
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:15,914
they say you got to do another one for 
free because you messed up the first 

1001
00:42:19,551 --> 00:42:20,384
one.
I don't recall anybody ever talking to 

1002
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:24,230
me in that tone.
They don't fuck it up day.

1003
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:25,400
Yeah,
you guys,

1004
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,313
you got to do another,
you got it free because a no one's 

1005
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:33,500
lucky.
You still live in fucking punk.

1006
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:37,010
Yeah.
So let me tell you someone,

1007
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,230
we get the shit all the time.
I don't get this.

1008
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,630
I don't get that respect.
You don't get what?

1009
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,640
I don't get that respect that people ask
me for me.

1010
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,660
Get again to the Oh no,
you'll,

1011
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,760
you'll get no,
I know.

1012
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:49,310
There was no,
this has been shit that I've screwed up.

1013
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,233
Um,
but I said there's a buffer between me 

1014
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:53,810
and them,
so I love that.

1015
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,120
So Andrew,
who runs,

1016
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:55,581
it'd be like,
yeah,

1017
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:56,311
listen,
these guys,

1018
00:42:56,311 --> 00:42:57,100
they were a little upset about it.

1019
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,490
It's just fucking read it again.
It's like,

1020
00:42:58,491 --> 00:42:58,911
all right,
cool.

1021
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:00,920
I'll read it,
but I don't get the whole whatever.

1022
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,260
Sit Down Mafia,
sit down that you get.

1023
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,140
So you did get them read it again.
I don't know.

1024
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,930
You don't even know.
Ignorance is bliss.

1025
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,760
Yeah.
It's not to call you ignorant.

1026
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:11,561
No,
I am making.

1027
00:43:11,561 --> 00:43:12,394
Right,
but you don't.

1028
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,140
But I'm smart enough to know that you 
don't talk to your advertisers there.

1029
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,410
It's like I didn't get into podcasting 
to do a conference call with you fucking

1030
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,060
guys talking about this shirt you're 
trying to sell.

1031
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,610
Like I get it.
It's a shirt you wrote.

1032
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:26,750
What you going to say?
Just like,

1033
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:27,584
I don't want to listen to you guys.
Like do you just trying to fill up your 

1034
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:31,540
day?
So many people in,

1035
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:35,390
in those fucking corporations,
they just trying to justify that desk.

1036
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,600
So then the,
the whole,

1037
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,183
I hate when the conference call ends and
then you hear this voice that you 

1038
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:43,184
haven't heard the whole call and it's 
like you were afraid that everyone was 

1039
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:50,390
going to hang up and you didn't say yes 
and now you're in a panic mode.

1040
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,660
So then they just throw something out 
there and you have to address it.

1041
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:54,494
Like,
it's a legitimate comment w when it 

1042
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:57,230
isn't,
it's just like,

1043
00:43:57,231 --> 00:43:58,064
you know,
go through a lot of those because you 

1044
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:04,340
went from being working kind of day jobs
to doing comedy full time.

1045
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,810
I presume barely do them anymore.
But I used to,

1046
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,953
I used to do,
when I had conference calls on scripts 

1047
00:44:10,821 --> 00:44:12,890
or anything,
what I would do would,

1048
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:13,724
I would put the phone on speaker and I 
would throw it to the other side of the 

1049
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:18,770
bed and then I would go,
she got video.

1050
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:19,604
I would literally lay on the bed,
like with my arm across my eyes and I 

1051
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:26,270
would just wait for people to stop 
talking and then I'd just be like,

1052
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:26,781
yeah,
you know,

1053
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:27,614
it sounds good.
So I don't know why I can watch so many 

1054
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:33,270
hours of sports yet.

1055
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,530
I can't even,
I can't even,

1056
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:37,330
like,
I can't handle more than it.

1057
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,620
They drive me insane.
Um,

1058
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:41,903
well I like texting.
You don't phone calling someone on the 

1059
00:44:45,661 --> 00:44:47,100
phone.
It's almost like an insane thing to do.

1060
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:47,940
These,
it's like rude.

1061
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,631
It's like,
dude,

1062
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:49,464
what?
Unless you have like sort of sort of 

1063
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:52,310
intimate relationship.
You know what I mean?

1064
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,570
If I call it you loads,
it's important.

1065
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,040
What happened.
If I call him,

1066
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,830
if I thought,
if I call Isla to Chitchat,

1067
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,050
that'd be weird.
Jail.

1068
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,160
If he called me,
I was like,

1069
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:02,994
hey,
how you doing?

1070
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:04,741
I'd be like,
okay,

1071
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:06,000
what?
What is it?

1072
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,330
You know what I mean?
Like I feel like since we've,

1073
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:12,660
we had the kid,
my wife finds me calling her man.

1074
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,883
No,
it's annoying because she either is in 

1075
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:20,400
the middle of his shit storm or she 
finally got a break and then my dumb ass

1076
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:23,700
is going to be like she,
she this Guy Sean supermarket,

1077
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:26,560
she just like,
I just feel,

1078
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,760
I just want my,
I got 10 minutes.

1079
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:30,603
This list.
Yeah,

1080
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,160
so she's a trooper.
Oh,

1081
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,330
I wanted to tell you about this make 
good we got and I think I need to remove

1082
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:37,710
myself because it's actually drove me 
crazy.

1083
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,330
It was funny though.
They said,

1084
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,890
I said,
when I was doing a copy read,

1085
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,520
get your free trial for $5 but what was 
written was for 95 and they said,

1086
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:48,714
you have to do it again for free because
you said $5 instead of four 95 you 

1087
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:54,570
should've just said,
well,

1088
00:45:54,571 --> 00:45:55,940
I'm not doing that.
We did.

1089
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:57,953
They said,
okay,

1090
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,110
yeah,
okay.

1091
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,980
Yeah,
that bluff and they're holding nothing.

1092
00:46:01,981 --> 00:46:03,870
Yeah.
You have to do it again for free.

1093
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:04,980
No,
I know,

1094
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,813
but no,
it is totally a game of being better 

1095
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,680
because you went higher,
so now all my God,

1096
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:13,350
I just save the nickel.
I love this fight.

1097
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,670
Exactly.
It's a twist.

1098
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,181
Yeah.
No.

1099
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:18,810
If you said like you know for 50 then 
they find out is for 95 then they have a

1100
00:46:18,811 --> 00:46:19,644
45 cent.

1101
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,310
Now we've got a problem,
man.

1102
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:21,841
Okay.
Yeah.

1103
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:22,674
Now you have a conference call.
Now nobody's going to chime in on that 

1104
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:26,800
one.
Hmm.

1105
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,270
How do I,
as a fan of your podcast,

1106
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:31,104
the Monday morning podcast,
everybody who was not listening to the 

1107
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:36,180
Monday more podcasts,
please do because it is my favorite.

1108
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:37,643
How do you prepare for that podcast?
Because you sit down and get talk and I 

1109
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:42,090
swear to God it's like you're doing 
material.

1110
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,020
But yeah,
no,

1111
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,990
you're just talking.
But like I always wonder,

1112
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:48,990
how do you prepare?
Do you prepare at all for your podcast?

1113
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,940
I,
uh,

1114
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,280
Andrew sends me the advertising,
copy it,

1115
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,340
I copy and paste it and then he sends me
the questions for the week.

1116
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,620
I copy and paste that and I stick it 
under the ads.

1117
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:04,680
I never broken down my whole game thing,
my game film.

1118
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:08,610
And then what I do is I'll just write 
pats game,

1119
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,710
you know,
topics,

1120
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:11,700
big feet,
blah,

1121
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:12,031
blah,
blah,

1122
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:12,390
whatever.

1123
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:17,310
And then I just start talking and uh,
if it's not going well,

1124
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:19,620
I go to the list.
If it goes great,

1125
00:47:19,621 --> 00:47:20,454
I barely look at the list and all of a 
sudden I looked down and I've done like 

1126
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:24,310
a half hour and a half or even done the 
region.

1127
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,520
I know that the question goes one,
I'm going to take like,

1128
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,340
uh,
20 minutes or so and um,

1129
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,750
yeah,
that's basically how I do it.

1130
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,010
No,
but through wound,

1131
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:35,310
you're going throughout the week in 
between podcasts,

1132
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:38,140
do you take notes of Shit you want to 
talk about or do you sit down and you're

1133
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:38,441
like,
oh,

1134
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,120
I remember that.
I won't talk about that.

1135
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,093
No.
Like I need a side on topics as I just 

1136
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:46,510
sit down and I just thought and I'm just
like,

1137
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,100
ah,
fuck what happened to me in the last,

1138
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,570
I know something happened and you can 
build the anecdote about like,

1139
00:47:51,571 --> 00:47:52,404
uh,
you were making a sandwich and the lady 

1140
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:54,844
was,
she asked for a special thing and the 

1141
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:56,770
lady was just like,
no.

1142
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,880
Oh my God.
But,

1143
00:47:57,881 --> 00:47:58,714
which was so funny,
but I would remember because you know 

1144
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:04,540
what I hated about the guy was he was,
he was on his tip toes watching.

1145
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,910
I wanted a Bagel and I feel like they 
can visualize,

1146
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,480
they wanted butter on them and you know,
it's just fucking airport.

1147
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,400
Yeah.
And they've got like the little,

1148
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:13,130
the little,
you know,

1149
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,130
little conveyor belt thing and they sent
it through and he's,

1150
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,710
he was just sitting there like,
like a mere cat.

1151
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:19,120
Right.
And,

1152
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,150
and he was just annoying me because I've
had that job.

1153
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,970
It's just like we just met him,
make the thing and be done with it.

1154
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:25,721
And he just said,
oh,

1155
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:26,554
could you,
could you,

1156
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:27,783
could you just put the butter on it?
I would just put the butter on it and 

1157
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:30,580
she's,
and she was just like,

1158
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:32,620
she was like a,
like a grisled vet.

1159
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,453
She was just like,
what?

1160
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:36,460
Can you just,
I was just wondering,

1161
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:38,710
can you,
can you put the butter on it now?

1162
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:39,680
You know,
before I go to register,

1163
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,290
she goes,
oh,

1164
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,130
the buttons over there.
And he goes,

1165
00:48:42,131 --> 00:48:42,340
no,
no.

1166
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,140
I was just hoping,
can you spread it now?

1167
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:45,220
So like,
cause it's still warm.

1168
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:46,600
I want it to be melted.
Can you do that?

1169
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:48,220
And she just goes,
no,

1170
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,143
I love that fucking laugh.
And I looked there and she just looked 

1171
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:57,060
at me and be like,
half a cigarette hanging out on him.

1172
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,360
I'll say,
what do you want us like ham and cheese?

1173
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,970
But I guess that that mammary was you,
you,

1174
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:01,873
you have a good memory I think because I
don't think I would have held onto even 

1175
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,550
even something that precious.
But you've always got,

1176
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,050
I mean,
you do a twice a week too,

1177
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:08,884
so there's a lot of time to fill,
but you somehow capture these memories 

1178
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,600
and retell it in a way optic,
you know,

1179
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:14,980
I got it.

1180
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:15,813
You have the tower clip.
My favorite little bit up on my podcast 

1181
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,820
is because I'm making my wife laugh,
which is my favorite thing in the world.

1182
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,880
She has the greatest lots of cute and 
thank you.

1183
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:29,180
I can be adorable.
That is like my pocket.

1184
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,420
That could be a horrible every once in a
while.

1185
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,600
Um,
I told her this story of a,

1186
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:38,050
I first told the story of watching this 
old guy wipe out on a scooter sliding on

1187
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:38,884
his face.
And then it reminded me of this time I 

1188
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:42,470
saw this guy,
um,

1189
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,673
this guy in griffith park was in street 
clothes and went down the steepest hill 

1190
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,880
and wiped out and I was telling the 
story.

1191
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:52,714
It was like a Sherry sperry thing that 
it started making me laugh and then my 

1192
00:49:55,061 --> 00:49:55,894
wife started laughing and you know,
that story that listening heard her 

1193
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:02,840
laugh.

1194
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,060
That's why we got married,
that,

1195
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:04,900
that whole story,
right.

1196
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,700
The chemistry and that whole thing.
Like I,

1197
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:08,260
I listen,
I listen,

1198
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,920
I'll go back and I listened to that like
once a year and a no,

1199
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:14,320
I feel lucky that I met somebody that 
has like,

1200
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:20,010
she's as funny as most comedians I know,
and she has an incredible sense of humor

1201
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,080
and um,
it's kind of a,

1202
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:24,761
it was,
yeah,

1203
00:50:24,761 --> 00:50:26,080
it was just something that,
you know,

1204
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,040
someone like me,
a lunatic,

1205
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:32,390
I needed someone like that,
that could laugh that hard if somebody's

1206
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:34,880
falling off a skateboard.
How did you guys meet,

1207
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:36,050
by the way,
you and your wife?

1208
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,640
Um,
well,

1209
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:39,110
she's in the business.
She worked on,

1210
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,850
um,
Chappelle's show,

1211
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,230
but she didn't,
I was on season two.

1212
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:44,720
She was on season actors or no,
she was,

1213
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,550
uh,
um,

1214
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,650
what was she on that,
I forget what she was on that one.

1215
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,000
But on,
on tough crowd was when I met her.

1216
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:52,400
She was a talent coordinator,
but she also was an actress.

1217
00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:54,740
She's been interactor than I am.
Every bit is funny.

1218
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:57,230
So she's like one of those people that 
is so good at everything.

1219
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,573
It's trying to figure out which 
direction to go in where I am a one 

1220
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:03,530
trick pony.
That's not true.

1221
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,260
Uh,
if you really look at it,

1222
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,430
if you look closely,
yeah.

1223
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,620
If you look at the credit,
wow,

1224
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:09,950
this guy's all over the place and 
they're like,

1225
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,930
hey,
you got a TV show fucking break.

1226
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:15,530
Give me a break.
Yeah.

1227
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:18,070
And I play Frank Murphy,
who's allowed screaming jackass.

1228
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,470
I do stand out loud screaming jackass.
I do my podcasts in the movie.

1229
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,160
Jack be driving over here loud screaming
jackass.

1230
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:28,520
You're planning,
you see DC AC DC,

1231
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,710
three courts.
But seriously,

1232
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:31,544
the movie does seem to not to be a 
departure from the loud screaming 

1233
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:34,370
jackass.

1234
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:35,203
Which movie?
The one that's going out in front 

1235
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:37,430
runner?
My God.

1236
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,263
Yeah.
I mean I saw it from the trailer's not 

1237
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:40,844
that much information,
but you seem to be playing a very 

1238
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,053
sincere detective.
Did I understand that role playing a 

1239
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:49,071
reporter.
Oh,

1240
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:49,904
your report.
Okay.

1241
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,223
Who works for them,
who mysteriously still possesses my 

1242
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:56,660
Boston accent and mean,
well hugh grant,

1243
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:57,494
who I think is going to get nominated 
for an Oscar like in between takes is 

1244
00:52:00,261 --> 00:52:01,094
speaking like us.
He's Australia and that's what he talks 

1245
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:06,350
like and then an action and then he's,
he's fucking Gary Hart.

1246
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,330
That wasn't nice.
I find that amazing.

1247
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:09,203
I probably shouldn't,
it's because as opposed to me who just 

1248
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:15,230
memorized his lines and tries to make it
sound believable.

1249
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,240
Well I can't wait to see that movie 
looks really good.

1250
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:18,960
It really,
when I saw the trailer office,

1251
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,540
uh,
it's amazing.

1252
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,760
I have to start learning everybody 
else's name in it because I,

1253
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:23,594
um,
I was only on it for a and with a 

1254
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:28,850
limited amount of actors because 
everybody just crushes it.

1255
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:29,481
It's a bunch of,
you know,

1256
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:30,314
to me that kids,
I'm 50 so they're all in their twenties 

1257
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,820
and thirties and I was just like,
you know,

1258
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,350
I was kind of watching and going like,
hey,

1259
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,280
here's the next batch.
Like these men and women are going to be

1260
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,463
be doing stuff.
So I'm very happy for all of those 

1261
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:44,420
people.
Are you,

1262
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,390
it's hard to tell from the trailer,
but is it a major role in the film or is

1263
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:50,600
it more of a like kind of secondary 
character?

1264
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,700
Uh,
more like a 14th.

1265
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:53,641
Okay.
Okay.

1266
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:54,474
Okay.
Alright.

1267
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:58,470
Do you want to act the more movies you 
seem to enjoy it.

1268
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,620
I love it.
I really,

1269
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,090
I,
I,

1270
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,570
it's,
it's weird now that I have a kid,

1271
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:03,404
but I learned on that one that the next 
time I'm just going to rent a place and 

1272
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:07,220
bring my wife and kid.

1273
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:10,880
That was,
yeah,

1274
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:11,930
that was hard.
Oh my God.

1275
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:12,764
My kid today was coolest thing ever.
Like she occasionally now speak since 

1276
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,460
we'll do two words,
you know,

1277
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:21,170
if she's not shy or anything like that.
So she had to get one of her shots today

1278
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,030
and she's been over there a bunch of 
times,

1279
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:23,864
so she knew.
So she would go to the doctors and she 

1280
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:25,770
was like,
you know,

1281
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:27,263
getting all nervous,
like,

1282
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,370
like a dog going to the vet.
So,

1283
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,293
you know,
they're gonna shoot it into a little 

1284
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:34,320
cute little thigh and like she's sitting
there and she's like,

1285
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:35,223
ah.
And she shot her and gave her the shot 

1286
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,680
and she starts crying and she goes,
okay,

1287
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:42,150
it's over.
When she say,

1288
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:43,470
yeah,
she looked at the nurse,

1289
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:44,620
she goes,
oh,

1290
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,810
done five,
five.

1291
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,810
Oh,
I like broke my heart.

1292
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,460
And I was proud that she said three 
words and she totally communicate.

1293
00:53:56,461 --> 00:53:58,110
It's like,
yeah.

1294
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:59,543
It seems like you're in love with your 
daughter hearing you talk about her on 

1295
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:01,944
the podcast quite well.
You've pretty perceptive like a carrot 

1296
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,200
more than that.
Okay.

1297
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:09,210
Because again,
you're this character,

1298
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,160
you gush,
Gush over your daughter.

1299
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:13,140
Not everyone.
Gushes did your Dad Gush over you?

1300
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,060
Uh,
I mean I was too little.

1301
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:15,871
Yeah.
Now my dad was,

1302
00:54:15,871 --> 00:54:19,320
my dad actually at worked it at work.
That's what I learned.

1303
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:20,070
Like,
oh my God.

1304
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:21,420
Yeah.
He really likes us.

1305
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:22,860
Oh,
when he came home,

1306
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:25,600
Hey,
he was cracking the whip your bed mate,

1307
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,030
you're doing your studies.
Well,

1308
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:27,910
why not?
You know,

1309
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,850
is that shit?
And uh,

1310
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:31,500
he also had a zillion kids,
so I mean,

1311
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:32,820
yeah.
How many siblings do you have?

1312
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:33,803
I don't know,
Dude.

1313
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,450
The Internet's too fucking weird to give
out all that information.

1314
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,403
You don't even want to say how many 
because you're afraid that it will 

1315
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,840
optimize your talking about it.
Is there anybody you can cut this out?

1316
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,360
I'm honest dude.
Like seriously dude,

1317
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:45,661
I,
yeah,

1318
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,580
this fucking lunatics out there.
Okay,

1319
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,630
well off the year,
off the year.

1320
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,740
I'll tell you.
Alright,

1321
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,200
cheese.
I love how surprised he is.

1322
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,960
Chief actual lutely crazy.
Keep walking.

1323
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,633
No,
I'm not.

1324
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:04,020
What I gotta do,
what you have to do is just consistently

1325
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:06,210
lie and changed names.
I actually,

1326
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:07,044
I do have friends that do that.
I don't think I'm smart enough to do 

1327
00:55:08,581 --> 00:55:11,350
that,
but I have friends who are youtube burns

1328
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,193
their front facing persona that everyone
knows them by their name and everything 

1329
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,130
is a complete fabrication and they're 
brilliant.

1330
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:20,964
I wish I thought about that because 
we've had creepy people coming to our 

1331
00:55:23,761 --> 00:55:24,594
house,
the same assholes that created a lot of 

1332
00:55:27,031 --> 00:55:28,800
this spy where shit like if you're 
already thinking that,

1333
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:29,740
oh,
they just had a,

1334
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,170
or they are smart,
you know?

1335
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:32,603
But yeah,
if I could,

1336
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,890
well I could never do it all over again 
because of what I do.

1337
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:37,020
I need social media.
But if I wasn't,

1338
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,720
um,
you know,

1339
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,793
a performer,
if I was a manager or anything like 

1340
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:42,744
that,
I would have a website but I would not 

1341
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:45,750
be on social media at all.
Interesting.

1342
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:46,943
Yeah.

1343
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,183
All right.
I don't know why that's so flat on my 

1344
00:55:54,181 --> 00:55:55,320
part.
Tell me about,

1345
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,580
uh,
all things comedy.

1346
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,810
I Dunno.
You say I'm nervous.

1347
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:59,490
I'm sweating here.
I'm just going to let you sit.

1348
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,590
I know you are.
You don't have to save me.

1349
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,600
You got to push through to the other 
side.

1350
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,240
No,
I know,

1351
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:09,240
but you're not touching elliot.
If you are a lever on the other team,

1352
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:13,740
I'd have come out and check you for 
vaseline or something.

1353
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,960
You punched your hair and you feel a 
little too many times.

1354
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,150
He's doctor in the ball.
Shit.

1355
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:20,343
Alright.
Regroup.

1356
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,320
Um,
Jackie gleason.

1357
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:27,970
I think I have a question about your 
[inaudible] you being in that and having

1358
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:28,804
a kid.
We have been trying to have a kid and 

1359
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:31,984
the longer it takes,
we also kind of second question the 

1360
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:37,570
whole thing,
like should we have a kid?

1361
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:38,920
It's awesome.

1362
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,040
It's one of the few things that truly 
lives up to the hype reel.

1363
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,770
All these years of being lied to about 
the summertime movies.

1364
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:49,360
The good thing is it's awesome and uh,
you know,

1365
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,000
what do I know?
I'm only a year and a half fence.

1366
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:55,630
So my year and a half experience has 
been incredible.

1367
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,553
And the only advice I would give you is 
don't listen to 90% of other parents 

1368
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:07,270
because for some reason they take a joy 
out of trying to ruin the experience.

1369
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,321
Saying like,
Oh,

1370
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:12,160
you wait,
is your first one is going to change?

1371
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:13,023
No more drinking.
Oh my God gets leave now it says they 

1372
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:19,070
just hit you with all this dread and I 
was walking,

1373
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:21,160
I was just gonna be like,
you sound like a terrible father.

1374
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,040
Like you don't sound like you're 
enjoying it and that road,

1375
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:24,923
no.
Well why didn't you say all that 

1376
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:28,010
positive stuff?
You contin,

1377
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:28,780
you know what I mean?

1378
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,350
Like,
that's just,

1379
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:32,710
it's just how people just like to 
complain.

1380
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:37,750
No one shit trying to like a pass on the
knowledge.

1381
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,670
It's just like,
but in an annoying way.

1382
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,510
Yeah.
No.

1383
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,940
Like for the optimist,
I'm telling you.

1384
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,040
No,
I got a lot of sweetness in it.

1385
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,103
Yeah,
no,

1386
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,400
I,
yeah,

1387
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,840
I'm,
I am not what people think.

1388
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,630
I want to ask you about all things,
comment.

1389
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:54,460
You've got what,
what is all things comedy?

1390
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:57,880
Is it a production company?
Is it a podcasting network?

1391
00:57:57,881 --> 00:57:58,870
I mean,
this is a company.

1392
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,640
It's every,
it's everything.

1393
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:02,630
It's first it started off,
uh,

1394
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,473
you know,
years ago we were watching the whole 

1395
00:58:06,491 --> 00:58:10,240
podcast thing exploding and then 
watching what always happens,

1396
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:14,020
like the artists create a seed and then 
the businessman comes in is like,

1397
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:15,040
okay,
here's the deal.

1398
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:17,620
I'm going to wrangle all this up.
I'm going to own it,

1399
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:20,230
but you're going to get all this 
exposure and you're going to have to tap

1400
00:58:20,231 --> 00:58:21,064
dance for the rest of your night and I'm
gonna have a fucking yacht in five 

1401
00:58:22,691 --> 00:58:22,960
years.

1402
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,711
Right?
So we're like,

1403
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:24,730
well,
why,

1404
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:25,564
what's stopping us at this point?
The technology had come up about where 

1405
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,110
you could actually start your own thing.
And there was podcast networks out there

1406
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:32,944
where they,
they were doing this thing where they 

1407
00:58:34,301 --> 00:58:35,770
owned a percentage.
Oh,

1408
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:36,604
of it.
Yeah.

1409
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,950
Owns your podcasts.
Worked with telling everybody going,

1410
00:58:38,951 --> 00:58:39,690
dude,
don't get,

1411
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,590
you don't have to give that away.
But like,

1412
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,053
um,
you see that kind of stuff on youtube a 

1413
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:45,180
lot too.
Right.

1414
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:47,530
But,
but a lot of people from my generation,

1415
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:48,221
you know,
in a weird,

1416
00:58:48,221 --> 00:58:49,054
like a prison kind of thing.
You were institutionalized where you 

1417
00:58:50,501 --> 00:58:52,060
just thought,
I can't own anything.

1418
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,250
I need to go to bigger thing.
It's like,

1419
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:56,950
no dude,
you have your own tv right here,

1420
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:59,140
your own channel.
Um,

1421
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,710
so we tried to do more of a Co op where 
everybody owns the thing,

1422
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,550
um,
owns their podcast and uh,

1423
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,090
yeah.

1424
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,760
So that's basically what,
and we all hype each other's projects,

1425
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,250
offers these,
um,

1426
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:15,040
when the guys are network network from 
the diversity effect podcast,

1427
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,620
when he had his first comedy cd come 
out,

1428
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,293
we all tweeted about it at the same time
and put out a great album and that came 

1429
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:24,044
together and he went number one on 
itunes and [inaudible] both the United 

1430
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:29,690
States and in Canada as an unknown at 
that point.

1431
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:34,220
And now we just produced a,
a standup special for him,

1432
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,690
uh,
for comedy central.

1433
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:37,870
And comedy central has bought,
uh,

1434
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,610
three more hours from us.
So we're going to produce so now and now

1435
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:44,360
we kind of get to pick and choose people
that we like these guys,

1436
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,490
men and women that we think are 
hilarious.

1437
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:48,410
So,
um,

1438
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,530
and uh,
so then,

1439
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:51,403
you know,
I'm currently writing a movie and you 

1440
00:59:53,361 --> 00:59:53,960
know,
we,

1441
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,880
we partnered with soapbox films and you 
know,

1442
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,990
you know,
I'm writing with somebody who isn't with

1443
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:01,220
all things coming,
but if he likes it,

1444
01:00:01,221 --> 01:00:04,280
we're going to drive it through there 
and just kind of build this thing up.

1445
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,500
And the whole thing was,
you know,

1446
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,270
uh,
to do this,

1447
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,140
trying to do it the right way.
It was was quite a task,

1448
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:13,250
but we just,
we just don't,

1449
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,093
we wanted to have comedians to have a 
frigging rail light that they could go 

1450
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:17,924
to where everybody wasn't just trying,
you didn't tell him to fuck you over 

1451
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,030
like on like on specials and stuff like 
that.

1452
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:27,290
This shit that goes down really that,
yeah,

1453
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:31,070
that stuff that goes down it,
you may like pie slices of the pie going

1454
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:31,933
and all different directions and like 
people haven't side deals with networks 

1455
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:36,140
that suck or going out of business,
you know,

1456
01:00:36,141 --> 01:00:38,330
that's something that we ran into and 
it's just like,

1457
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:39,980
Hey,
every specialty you bring us to,

1458
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,810
you get,
you get 60 grand.

1459
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,290
So then all of a sudden this guy 60 
grand,

1460
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,520
it's not going to tell you,
hey,

1461
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:47,354
go to this shithead network instead of 
that instead of like a Netflix or 

1462
01:00:51,621 --> 01:00:53,270
something where it's going to be seen.

1463
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,950
Yeah.
And it's just like,

1464
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,720
I'm like,
yeah,

1465
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:58,430
that's only the tip of the iceberg.
And then like,

1466
01:00:58,431 --> 01:01:00,950
you know,
expenses and all this and all this stuff

1467
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:03,990
and like sky high expenses with no 
accountability.

1468
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,270
Yes.
All of that type.

1469
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,590
Well the thing was,
you know,

1470
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:08,650
back in the day it was like,
you know,

1471
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,493
I swear to God there was some people 
that literally had like insight people 

1472
01:01:12,591 --> 01:01:14,900
like tmz has at the airports and say,
you know what,

1473
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:15,734
celebrities are going through.
Like they would literally have insight 

1474
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:18,644
people to network and they would figure 
out what your budget was cause you get 

1475
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:23,480
in business with a production company 
and you'd be like,

1476
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:24,650
what can you shoot this for him?
It's like,

1477
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:25,720
well how much money you got?
It's like,

1478
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:28,100
well I'm gonna fucking tell you that.
And they would somehow,

1479
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,990
I swear to God,
like if you had $1 million,

1480
01:01:29,991 --> 01:01:30,824
they'd be like,
oh we did the budget is gonna be like 

1481
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:35,360
999,000
and then if you had like nine bucks,

1482
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:37,610
it'd be like,
he's gonna be $8 and 99 cents like that.

1483
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,443
They are,
they're always like vacuumed up 

1484
01:01:39,471 --> 01:01:41,720
everything.
But that final fucking 8%.

1485
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:42,703
And then you know,
that they went out and they shot the 

1486
01:01:43,681 --> 01:01:44,900
thing for like 70.
Yeah.

1487
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:47,960
Like not even probably whatever,
whatever the number was.

1488
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:52,160
And they just skimmed it.
Just took it not skim and dude,

1489
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:54,440
they took a giant some fucking shovel 
out of there.

1490
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,620
And um,
you know,

1491
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:58,540
I,
that's the one thing that,

1492
01:01:58,541 --> 01:01:59,374
that they only like the one thing that 
has been really a disappointing getting 

1493
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:07,880
into the business world because I know 
it's not just the business that I am,

1494
01:02:07,881 --> 01:02:10,970
but just the level of what you say the 
business world.

1495
01:02:10,971 --> 01:02:11,804
You mean own being and don't just 
thinking because entertainment business 

1496
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:17,240
has a bad rep,
but it's just straight across the board.

1497
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:22,630
The uh,
the level of c I just unabashed stealing

1498
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,150
that happens in business and they 
justify it.

1499
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,400
They sleep like babies.
Yeah.

1500
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,820
It's,
it's so rampant that I don't even,

1501
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:37,290
I don't understand people that like 
steel,

1502
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,370
like you,
like anybody,

1503
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:39,204
if you're a thief,
like you should be working towards 

1504
01:02:41,431 --> 01:02:42,264
getting on the legal side of stealing 
because there's probably more stealing 

1505
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,490
on the legal side of stealing.
And now you don't have to hide the car.

1506
01:02:50,491 --> 01:02:53,070
It's all above board or whatever.
And it's just like,

1507
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:55,200
you know,
you see things like a lord of the rings.

1508
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,063
It grows like,
I don't know how many billions of 

1509
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,000
dollars a year.
Like the director had to like sue,

1510
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:03,960
like the better Jackson suit that they 
didn't pay him.

1511
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:06,120
They right.
They were saying they were not in,

1512
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,100
in uh,
profit.

1513
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,540
And it's a routine thing.
I'm learning this,

1514
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,580
you know,
writing a movie.

1515
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,593
It is,
it is a routine experience to be in one 

1516
01:03:15,451 --> 01:03:17,760
side of,
um,

1517
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:18,683
what are these big conglomerates 
pitching the sequel will while in the 

1518
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,214
other side of the building and the legal
department you're suing them for not 

1519
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:27,910
paying the first of that is so fun.

1520
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:31,200
Yeah.
And just like auditing and all of that,

1521
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,780
all of that with what they have.
This shit I've seen,

1522
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,643
I've been through these clubs were like,
you can audit us and if there's less 

1523
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:40,680
than a 5% discrepancy,
you have to pay for it.

1524
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:43,230
Five is good.
I usually get like 12 how do you,

1525
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:48,000
how do you fuck up paying me 12% yeah,
so and then all it's accounting,

1526
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:48,834
it's numbers.
Then you have to pay for the audit you 

1527
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,733
bought.
So they kind of gave themselves a 

1528
01:03:52,891 --> 01:03:56,250
license to steal exactly.
Eggs that that's all that means.

1529
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:59,100
I saw my first constitute what we 
legally owe you but,

1530
01:03:59,101 --> 01:03:59,934
but we're going to write this so we can 
steal this and then if they really 

1531
01:04:01,861 --> 01:04:04,550
greedy they'll actually go like beyond 
it.

1532
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,650
No,
there there are some,

1533
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:08,250
well they have nothing to lose click and
characters out there.

1534
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:10,740
The first time I saw that clause I was 
like,

1535
01:04:10,741 --> 01:04:13,860
okay,
so I have a 5% discrepancy,

1536
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:14,843
which means you're going to take 5% more
than you are and that is considered 

1537
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:21,450
being difficult if you say that.
Yeah.

1538
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,250
That's the,
which to me means what?

1539
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:25,030
Difficult like difficult to steal from.
Yeah.

1540
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,190
That happened to us all the time because
in youtube in the beginning there was so

1541
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:32,950
much not going on and we would not let 
it slide and say,

1542
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:34,130
hey,
we've got a youtube channel.

1543
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:34,993
I remember they had this thing where if 
any of your videos get flagged then you 

1544
01:04:39,151 --> 01:04:39,984
can cock sucker can take your revenue.
Well they said you don't get the 

1545
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,290
advertisements.
I said,

1546
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,460
oh,
so you don't run the ad?

1547
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:45,294
No,
we still run it.

1548
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:49,350
Well then he fucking gets it taken it 
what it is.

1549
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:52,890
Some would have a whole team of people 
youtube just flagging shit now are,

1550
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:55,520
that's what they do is like the,
I'm,

1551
01:04:55,521 --> 01:04:57,390
I'm,
I'm dealing with this shit all the time.

1552
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:59,640
What happens is if you're a copyright 
holder,

1553
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,833
and I mentioned you like we have a video
just talking about something and I 

1554
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,850
mentioned a clip,
right?

1555
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,270
Maybe I show it for a split second.
So they've got people,

1556
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,133
probably just some interns,
low-level grunts that just claim it and 

1557
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:14,334
they get the money and they make so much
money like that cause they just math do 

1558
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:19,630
it.
Do you know,

1559
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:24,430
my thing is when they're in the meeting 
and they present doing that,

1560
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:27,280
they presented like they are on a good 
mission.

1561
01:05:27,281 --> 01:05:32,281
Like you guys aren't there and they're 
basically presented how they're going on

1562
01:05:33,461 --> 01:05:35,260
a crusade there.
Copyright.

1563
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:36,670
That's what they,
yeah,

1564
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:37,663
we have to protect our copyright because
there's all these pirates online 

1565
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:43,510
stealing content and we're standing up 
for ourselves.

1566
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:44,660
No,
but I'm saying like if,

1567
01:05:44,661 --> 01:05:46,900
if they feel like what you said was 
offensive to somebody,

1568
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,810
they would flag it like,
oh yeah,

1569
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:50,644
then I shit,
it's just like that's going to be every 

1570
01:05:51,671 --> 01:05:52,504
clip.

1571
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,730
Yeah.
It's frustrating.

1572
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:55,870
But yeah,
it's,

1573
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:56,913
it can be really frustrating,
especially when you spend like a whole 

1574
01:05:58,841 --> 01:05:59,674
week working on a video.
Cause that's a lot of youtubers will 

1575
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:02,670
post like one video a week.
Right.

1576
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,810
And then all of a sudden some assholes 
just like mine.

1577
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,860
That's my money now.
How cause they collect,

1578
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,733
they'll claim it because maybe showed 
some of their work and there's a fair 

1579
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:12,544
use,
which means that you're allowed by US 

1580
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:15,034
copper about ripping people off.
I'm just talking about you put up your 

1581
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:19,140
own original content.
Yeah.

1582
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:20,100
Talking about,
you know,

1583
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:20,620
no,
it's,

1584
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:21,453
it's original content.
But if we talk about something like a 

1585
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,990
news way or reacting or talking or 
criticizing,

1586
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,260
you know,
sue him,

1587
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:33,500
you can do,
yeah,

1588
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,393
but you up.
But then you have to get that rep out 

1589
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:37,630
there that you do that it,
this is the bullying thing again.

1590
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:38,121
Like,
I don't,

1591
01:06:38,121 --> 01:06:39,730
I don't fuck with the h three podcasts,
man.

1592
01:06:39,731 --> 01:06:42,100
These guys don't go sue you.
It's not worth the headache.

1593
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:47,780
Waveband thought I lost a really big on.
We didn't win.

1594
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,270
You won.
Won.

1595
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:51,610
That's great.
When's the movie coming out?

1596
01:06:51,611 --> 01:06:53,830
Man?
I went out real good movie.

1597
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,440
It wasn't feeling good at the time,
but it was,

1598
01:06:56,441 --> 01:06:57,310
uh,
you know,

1599
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:59,320
I don't give a shit if you're recovering
from that,

1600
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:02,710
but I'm sure this is light goes on and 
show business as well.

1601
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:05,950
I don't know what goes on straight 
across all the other business.

1602
01:07:05,951 --> 01:07:09,210
Yeah.
War All the way down to the business of,

1603
01:07:09,211 --> 01:07:13,150
of a standup special.
It's like the people that are always,

1604
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,560
you know,
with the shovel,

1605
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:16,090
not skimming,
shoveling money out,

1606
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,210
they're such fucking rich.
They're so rich all the time too.

1607
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:22,920
And it's like they just cannot be fair.
I Dunno.

1608
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,291
Yeah.
That's the thing.

1609
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,170
Like,
I just wish I could talk to him and just

1610
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:30,110
like ask them,
well,

1611
01:07:30,111 --> 01:07:30,990
I mean I'm,
you know,

1612
01:07:30,991 --> 01:07:33,090
I'm not a perfect person.
I maybe that's just,

1613
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:33,924
you know,
where I fuck up in other areas of my 

1614
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,180
life.
Maybe this is just their thing,

1615
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:37,014
but I,
I just,

1616
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,940
you know,
fucking some,

1617
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:42,570
you know,
college kid out of the money on his,

1618
01:07:42,571 --> 01:07:44,100
on his page,
I don't know.

1619
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,100
Or some new comic on a special.
And so anyways,

1620
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:48,360
that's those,
it's basically,

1621
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:51,600
that's why we started,
you know,

1622
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,940
all things comedy and now it's just 
grown into this thing.

1623
01:07:53,941 --> 01:07:54,774
We,
uh,

1624
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:56,183
you know,
we're going to produce some TV shows 

1625
01:07:57,151 --> 01:07:59,880
who's starting to sign some deals and 
yeah.

1626
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,280
And it's like a management,
uh,

1627
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,470
no,
you represent them.

1628
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:05,550
No,
no.

1629
01:08:05,551 --> 01:08:06,900
We're all conglomerate.
Yeah.

1630
01:08:06,901 --> 01:08:08,760
And we'd like a production.
We can also like,

1631
01:08:08,761 --> 01:08:10,310
um,
uh,

1632
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,150
you know,
whatever you would want to do,

1633
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:14,920
the soapbox films they laid,
they literally end to end.

1634
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,430
It's a,
a union.

1635
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,181
Yeah.
The edited,

1636
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:18,014
like the muppet movies and all of that.
These guys can handle any bullshit idea 

1637
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,430
that I ever have in there.
So,

1638
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,650
um,
while all the comics are,

1639
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:25,750
I love,
I mean you got,

1640
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:28,850
you have so much talent there and your 
youtube channel is amazing love.

1641
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:29,900
Actually.
We're doing us.

1642
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:31,600
Something's burning.
Burning.

1643
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:32,990
Oh thanks.
Bertine.

1644
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,980
Yeah.
Or crushed.

1645
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:35,930
This is why I'm here.
He told me,

1646
01:08:35,931 --> 01:08:37,270
he goes,
you got less burden.

1647
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,120
He's such a sweetheart.
Um,

1648
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,620
do you watch you two videos at all?
Yeah,

1649
01:08:42,621 --> 01:08:43,500
I love Youtube.
Really?

1650
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:46,170
How can I do I want,
um,

1651
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:49,003
I like lions killing hyenas.
It always annoys me that they fucking 

1652
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,470
come over and they take the shit,
you know,

1653
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:57,380
and then the lines ended up in the tree,
you know,

1654
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:59,840
uh,
justice,

1655
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,670
my own idea.
I watch anime.

1656
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:07,990
I watch a lot of musicians videos,
like nobody's doing drum covers of songs

1657
01:09:10,341 --> 01:09:10,690
and they'd be,
oh,

1658
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:12,200
I'll watch them and maybe I'll learn 
something.

1659
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,620
Um,
you don't follow you tubers.

1660
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:17,960
I feel like there's two types of people.
There's like people that,

1661
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,640
cause there's so much great stuff on 
Youtube.

1662
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:21,560
Look tutorials and documentaries and 
stuff.

1663
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,360
I watch that shit.
I,

1664
01:09:23,361 --> 01:09:25,520
I don't get it like you want,
it annoys me.

1665
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:30,850
The worst is when there's like a,
say something happens like,

1666
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,083
okay,
so you were showing me that clip or 

1667
01:09:33,271 --> 01:09:34,104
whatever.
The little fellow there slide known his 

1668
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,124
face,
right?

1669
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,390
Yes,
the face grind.

1670
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:41,450
So it's just like,
it'll just say little person,

1671
01:09:41,451 --> 01:09:42,710
epic face grind.
Right.

1672
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:44,930
And then it comes on and all of a sudden
this guy,

1673
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,800
okay,
you're not going to win.

1674
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:51,490
I'm always like,
shout out the face man.

1675
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,553
He fucking face.
And it's like this isn't even your 

1676
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:55,154
fucking content.
And like there's so many endos so I'm 

1677
01:09:58,971 --> 01:09:59,804
sure I haven't seen the good ones 
because there's an art form to all of 

1678
01:10:01,941 --> 01:10:02,360
it.

1679
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,920
But I always just feel like it's always 
like,

1680
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:05,120
you know,
eyebrows up,

1681
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:07,750
super high energy guys,
check,

1682
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:12,780
can you believe this?
Well then he starts to show right before

1683
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:17,980
now watch this.
I mean this dude was like,

1684
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:20,740
dude,
I fucking get it.

1685
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,333
It's like someone who doesn't know how 
to tell a fucking story and things 

1686
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:25,203
should be over in like 30 seconds and 
now I got to sit to fucking three 

1687
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:28,580
minutes.
He get bullshit.

1688
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,120
That is kind of a meme on youtube was 
like the tutorials where you're like,

1689
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:32,983
okay,
I'm going to show you how to use 

1690
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:35,600
photoshop.
And then like 10 minutes,

1691
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:36,434
20 seconds.
Then after describing his whole life 

1692
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:40,244
story,
he gets to the point now he knows the 

1693
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:43,460
worst.
It was expert village.

1694
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:47,990
Oh I love that.
You've been around.

1695
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,130
Excellent.
Rich.

1696
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,013
What the fuck?
I want to show you some of my favorite 

1697
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:55,874
expert that was playing guitar and so 
expert village Ozzy and it was always 

1698
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:05,504
wrong.

1699
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:07,070
Hold on.
Always stuck.

1700
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,250
The expert village was a phenomenon.
I love it.

1701
01:11:10,251 --> 01:11:13,530
We made one of my most cherished videos 
about expert.

1702
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:15,480
Exactly.
Nobody wasn't that.

1703
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:20,510
They were [inaudible] about like how to 
make a cheese melt and then don't,

1704
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,860
don't put it in the microwave for 30 
seconds.

1705
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,910
And that's the thing.
Wait,

1706
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,540
I got to show you how to flirt.
I hate it.

1707
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:28,830
And then they would like,
they were like,

1708
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,280
you couldn't get away from him for 
awhile.

1709
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:33,270
Like you'd go to a search and then all 
of them.

1710
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:37,140
Cause you mentioned expert village,
I think it's important to bring you,

1711
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,240
show you what's up here.
Okay,

1712
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:40,223
look at this guy now.
I've now this video I love because look 

1713
01:11:42,811 --> 01:11:44,110
how much dead air there is.
Okay,

1714
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:46,350
well it's not.
That's not hitting.

1715
01:11:46,351 --> 01:11:47,760
He'll get blamed.
That's not his fault.

1716
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:49,930
Well,
either way they uploaded it.

1717
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:51,410
I mean they could've cut it for Christ's
sake.

1718
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,313
It is his fault because I think they 
make the video and then they submit it 

1719
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:57,480
to expert village and then expert 
village puts it up.

1720
01:11:58,140 --> 01:11:58,990
So here we are.
Size

1721
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:01,370
is the lighting with his shadow on the 
back wall to look at that.

1722
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,540
You getting seduced tie.
This is how we got no sound.

1723
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,700
Oh,
I'm a social dynamics instructor.

1724
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,930
And on behalf of expert village girl at 
a bar,

1725
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,560
how to flirt with the girl picking up 
women in bars and clubs,

1726
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,530
flirting.
What is it?

1727
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,633
Hmm?
The basics of flirting is to convey 

1728
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:28,660
through certain ideas and emotions that 
you like someone else and hopefully that

1729
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:29,744
the other person likes you back.
Now who are the best flirts in the 

1730
01:12:32,991 --> 01:12:36,710
world?
They're actually little kids now.

1731
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:39,020
Why is that?
Well for one thing,

1732
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:41,290
they did the best imaginations I was 
already feeling.

1733
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:42,124
Basically,

1734
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:46,100
you know where the sexiest people in the
world,

1735
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,533
little kid

1736
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:48,783
sandbox and then talking about some 
fantastic place that they can go on the 

1737
01:12:52,241 --> 01:12:53,074
wall,
on the wall in their mind to put 

1738
01:12:55,091 --> 01:12:55,924
themselves in a place that's just the 
two of them and their own special world 

1739
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:00,303
using their imagination.
Also little kids or how do you do that 

1740
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:04,470
as an adult?
They're realizing

1741
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:09,600
rape drug and it made her drowsy,
but you're going to get to the what?

1742
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:11,530
What do you want me to shell?
Oh,

1743
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:14,080
we're news.
Like the eyeball thing I,

1744
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,220
it's just,
it's kind of a long time.

1745
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:18,070
The words,
if I see a girl with blue eyes,

1746
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,810
I might say,
wow,

1747
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,180
your,
your eyes are like blueberries.

1748
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:23,493
Wait,
can I actually can actually I'm kinda 

1749
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,633
hungry.
Can I,

1750
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:28,900
can I have,
that's one thing that you could go into.

1751
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:34,230
Can I stick my fingers in your,
I thought he was so hot.

1752
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,070
You know,
who are the sex,

1753
01:13:37,071 --> 01:13:38,140
you know,
who are the best flirt?

1754
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:39,691
When he said,
Oh my God,

1755
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:41,070
your eyes are like blueberries,
blueberries.

1756
01:13:41,071 --> 01:13:44,220
It was the wrong word.
Vibe was good,

1757
01:13:44,221 --> 01:13:46,410
but then you start doing the little into
the Karen.

1758
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:48,720
It makes me feel really calm to squash 
your fucking eyes.

1759
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:51,840
These are their experts anyway.
Love expert village happy.

1760
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:52,531
You miss that.
Hey,

1761
01:13:52,531 --> 01:13:54,630
you remember this lady?
Let me ask you about this.

1762
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:57,780
I like,
I like to wash your hands.

1763
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,040
You like this.
You remember this lady?

1764
01:13:59,160 --> 01:13:59,993
No,
I haven't.

1765
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:00,913
The fail videos,
the woman's stepping on the grapes and 

1766
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:04,763
that was falls off like that was just 
somebody who never had the wind knocked 

1767
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:08,760
out of him before and so she didn't know
it.

1768
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:10,880
Stop talking.
So she's you,

1769
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:11,980
you know,
I used to hear that

1770
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,680
on Howard stern all the time and I never
know what it's from and I thought it was

1771
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,290
like a crazy orgy sound like I never 
knew.

1772
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,203
And then when I saw it,
I got f obviously I got to pull it up 

1773
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:22,010
now.
Uh,

1774
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,530
she's smashing grapes,
right?

1775
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,070
Great Lady.
Ric flair videos.

1776
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:30,460
Great.
Here you go.

1777
01:14:30,461 --> 01:14:31,910
This is it.
Good enough.

1778
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,950
If you could find the original,
this is it right here.

1779
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:35,803
These buckets are filled with grief.
What kind of grades either filled with 

1780
01:14:38,211 --> 01:14:41,920
shame or thin gray.
And the winner this Saturday you stomped

1781
01:14:41,921 --> 01:14:42,754
the most juice will actually when an 
overnight stay or shot the alarm when 

1782
01:14:45,011 --> 01:14:46,540
you're ready to try it.
Yeah,

1783
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:48,160
sure.
That'd been in a group.

1784
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:53,680
You're,
you give us a 32nd steps though.

1785
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:55,970
19 million.
Good measure.

1786
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:56,813
I mean it is kind of one of them.
That's the thing he's ever done a juice 

1787
01:15:02,051 --> 01:15:05,860
it the metric overnight.
Alright.

1788
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,720
And if you,
if you,

1789
01:15:07,721 --> 01:15:10,750
when you get to stay a short line and 
what else do you have going on in here?

1790
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:16,150
Come and spend the day lag.
Getting international,

1791
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:20,700
having wine tours and tastings and your 
tour's seminars,

1792
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:22,840
arts and crafts.
It's a lot of fun.

1793
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:24,430
A whole day.
Stop.

1794
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:31,550
How?
Wow.

1795
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:37,780
Oh no

1796
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:42,853
lives.
Just to put those things up on that 

1797
01:15:46,091 --> 01:15:46,924
platform.
That woman is how I got to hold his 

1798
01:15:48,391 --> 01:15:53,391
shoes up there.
I can't be all that sound man.

1799
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:55,210
I love it.
You can't beat it.

1800
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,073
You remember this slide you have to do 
talks about her or they didn't play 

1801
01:15:58,211 --> 01:15:59,320
enough.
But I want to show you,

1802
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,930
I want to remind you of this,
this great.

1803
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:03,003
There's like your hands to hand model.
Like to say that my hands look good 

1804
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:08,710
naked.
They are really just the perfect,

1805
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:10,980
neutral,
toned hands.

1806
01:16:10,981 --> 01:16:15,980
So that the hand model is,
and it's a very even tone while heading,

1807
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,611
right?
Yeah,

1808
01:16:16,611 --> 01:16:17,370
yeah,
yeah.

1809
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:19,090
I guess creepy,
creepy shit.

1810
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:20,360
Wow.
This is good stuff.

1811
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,570
That's stuff that we've made videos 
about.

1812
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,340
I'm sorry.
You're very protective of her house.

1813
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:32,090
What else was going on?
I want to ask you about this.

1814
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:33,013
Um,
this is one of the first time I heard 

1815
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:36,440
about you.
I was in college,

1816
01:16:36,441 --> 01:16:41,441
I think at the time it was when you were
getting booed by thousands of people.

1817
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:42,553
And I was like,
when you said my favorite youtube video 

1818
01:16:44,351 --> 01:16:45,111
is like,
Oh God,

1819
01:16:45,111 --> 01:16:47,930
not the philly thing again.
And then you did the Sherry's berries.

1820
01:16:47,931 --> 01:16:50,120
I was like,
I love this podcast now.

1821
01:16:50,121 --> 01:16:52,040
I hate you.
I love,

1822
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:52,903
what can I do?
I love that joke and I'm fucking with 

1823
01:16:54,321 --> 01:16:55,154
you.
Do it.

1824
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:59,910
But no,
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna ask for,

1825
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,010
I get that boat.
But Barb,

1826
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,220
you've,
you've talked about this a lot.

1827
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:09,760
Probably more than the grape lady.
I didn't realize.

1828
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:12,890
No,
but I go ahead.

1829
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,500
Let's do it.
Skip it.

1830
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:19,280
I like making them,
well,

1831
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,070
what am I,
what am I going?

1832
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:21,950
Yeah,
right.

1833
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,290
And now what do you want me to be?
Well,

1834
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:27,680
what was going through your head bill,
when you're good by all those people?

1835
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,303
I don't know.
I don't remember what was going through 

1836
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:33,680
your head.
No,

1837
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:35,740
I'm kidding.
This is going to end up on youtube.

1838
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:37,810
This is lie.

1839
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:40,450
This is going to end up on youtube was 
what I was what I was thinking.

1840
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,220
Cause everything else on the tour was 
ending up on youtube so that,

1841
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,650
um,
yeah,

1842
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:50,050
I guess that's what was going on.
So no,

1843
01:17:50,051 --> 01:17:52,240
I think I thought that afterwards and 
I'm like,

1844
01:17:52,241 --> 01:17:53,074
well that's going to be embarrassing 
because I didn't know how people were 

1845
01:17:54,331 --> 01:17:56,080
going to take it.
I thought people were just to say,

1846
01:17:56,081 --> 01:17:56,920
oh,
you got booed,

1847
01:17:56,921 --> 01:17:57,754
you fucking stink and blah blah.
I didn't know that people were going to 

1848
01:17:59,381 --> 01:18:01,270
find it funny.
Fortunately they did.

1849
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:02,223
You did kind of win the audience over.
Did you feel that while you were on the 

1850
01:18:04,571 --> 01:18:05,404
stage or was it just like,
these people hate my guts the whole 

1851
01:18:07,751 --> 01:18:09,310
time?
Because it was no

1852
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:13,020
thought it was a complete failure.
I have no idea.

1853
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:13,973
Uh,
yeah.

1854
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:14,813
Well,
I don't know how many of our fans have 

1855
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:17,190
seen it.
I've got to pull up a clip.

1856
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:17,650
Okay,
go ahead.

1857
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:19,860
Go ahead by God.
We should skip this.

1858
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:20,160
No,
no.

1859
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,470
Go ahead and push the skin.
I should have been more of,

1860
01:18:22,471 --> 01:18:23,690
I should have been a better sport.
No,

1861
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,080
you're a good sport.
You're doing your thing.

1862
01:18:25,081 --> 01:18:27,390
You're being authentic.
You're authentic.

1863
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:29,423
Now this is just going to,
now this is the kind of thing that 

1864
01:18:30,691 --> 01:18:32,740
somebody who buys a dog does,
right?

1865
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,230
Yeah.
Wow.

1866
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,970
Really?
Get me deep down.

1867
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,640
Get down to the ground.
Um,

1868
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,133
now this is just going to be about me 
being uncomfortable showing you this 

1869
01:18:42,331 --> 01:18:43,164
video.

1870
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:46,910
I imagine there's a bunch of comments 
though.

1871
01:18:46,911 --> 01:18:47,930
Now going half.
Fuck you.

1872
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:50,180
The Eagles beat the Patriots.
I would think that there'd be a bunch of

1873
01:18:50,181 --> 01:18:50,650
that.

1874
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:52,450
Someone these to animate this two years 
ago,

1875
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:57,480
but the video quality is fucking weird.
Anyway,

1876
01:19:00,761 --> 01:19:02,290
they all Bujo I,
yeah,

1877
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:05,770
all you guys get it.
But for me that was my first heard about

1878
01:19:05,771 --> 01:19:07,690
you.
Was that a big moment in your career?

1879
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,420
Like a,
did you get a lot of recognition with it

1880
01:19:10,421 --> 01:19:11,254
cause it kind of went viral back then?
I mean that's the first time I heard of 

1881
01:19:13,091 --> 01:19:13,740
you.

1882
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:14,790
Uh,
yeah.

1883
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:15,960
Um,
well I got,

1884
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:16,794
I got,
um,

1885
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,920
you know,
respect from other comedians,

1886
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:23,070
which was probably the thing that I 
remember most.

1887
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:23,993
But um,
as far as like people coming out to the 

1888
01:19:25,681 --> 01:19:27,660
comedy clubs to see,
I don't think that that happened.

1889
01:19:27,661 --> 01:19:28,200
I,
I,

1890
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,620
the reason why when I started drawing on
the road was because I did a,

1891
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,513
uh,
I did a half hour on hbo and I was 

1892
01:19:35,071 --> 01:19:38,670
sitting in for Jim Norton on the opiate 
Anthony show cause he was doing,

1893
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:39,533
uh,
Lucky Louie at the time when Louis Ck 

1894
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:45,530
was at hbo.
So I kind of had those two things hit at

1895
01:19:45,841 --> 01:19:46,674
one time.
And then so I was able to kind of get 

1896
01:19:50,761 --> 01:19:52,880
the coasts in ONA,
mark,

1897
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:53,671
not,
not the south,

1898
01:19:53,671 --> 01:19:56,310
but sort of,
I had the east coast and then I had like

1899
01:19:56,311 --> 01:19:59,240
San Francisco,
I could do well in and then open it.

1900
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:01,530
They were good right through like 
Cleveland.

1901
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:05,430
So an opiate anthony also would run 
like,

1902
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:07,370
uh,
you know,

1903
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:08,040
they,
you know,

1904
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,873
they didn't have the budget at Xm,
I think it was back then to pay us for 

1905
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:13,404
our appearances on the show.
So they would let us literally cut 

1906
01:20:15,361 --> 01:20:16,194
commercials about where we were going to
be and they were really funny and it 

1907
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:19,711
was,
you know,

1908
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:20,544
it was one of the cool,
like it was really cool that they did 

1909
01:20:22,591 --> 01:20:26,580
that and it was a major reason why,
you know,

1910
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:30,060
all of us started selling tickets.
So I really missed that show.

1911
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:33,570
I really do.
How did the comedians react?

1912
01:20:33,571 --> 01:20:34,404
Because I remember some guy tried to 
Yankee off stage towards the end it was 

1913
01:20:37,111 --> 01:20:37,531
like,
hey,

1914
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:41,150
how about the next comedian that 
happened?

1915
01:20:41,151 --> 01:20:42,330
I don't even remember that here.
I got it.

1916
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,860
I got it.
The thought.

1917
01:20:43,861 --> 01:20:46,860
You've seen it so many times.
Why would I want to relive that?

1918
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,370
I've never seen get out.
Let's get,

1919
01:20:49,371 --> 01:20:50,041
let's get,
let's get,

1920
01:20:50,041 --> 01:20:50,880
I've known.
What else?

1921
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,370
I had a headache for like two days.
I've been really,

1922
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:54,263
really well.
You were really stressed out afterwards 

1923
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:57,720
about it.
I was,

1924
01:20:57,721 --> 01:20:58,554
I remember walking around New York the 
next day looking at people thinking of 

1925
01:21:00,661 --> 01:21:02,220
insults.
It was not a,

1926
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:02,820
yeah,
it was,

1927
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:05,010
it wasn't a wholesome experience.
No,

1928
01:21:05,011 --> 01:21:06,570
you get booed by 10,000
people,

1929
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:09,570
so you just kind of getting that fight 
or flight mode.

1930
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,900
So I was kinda stuck in the,
I remember riding home with Robert Kelly

1931
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:13,734
that night.
It was like being nervous about like 

1932
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:19,831
that.
It was coming out.

1933
01:21:19,831 --> 01:21:20,281
He goes,
dude,

1934
01:21:20,281 --> 01:21:22,050
you realize what the fuck happened 
tonight.

1935
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:25,380
You just told the whole city of 
Philadelphia to go fuck themselves.

1936
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:26,940
And I was sitting there going like,
man,

1937
01:21:26,941 --> 01:21:29,370
when that shit hits you too,
tomorrow everyone's going to laugh at me

1938
01:21:29,371 --> 01:21:30,031
and just be like,
oh,

1939
01:21:30,031 --> 01:21:31,530
you got booed stats.

1940
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,810
See,
that to me is interesting because when I

1941
01:21:33,811 --> 01:21:35,070
watched that I'm like,
it's this.

1942
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:36,703
He's on fucking fire.
And he's authentic and it must feel 

1943
01:21:40,321 --> 01:21:43,050
incredible to tell 10,000
people to go fuck themselves.

1944
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:46,410
And like the most polite way,
it felt good to do it.

1945
01:21:46,411 --> 01:21:47,244
But I,
the perception of it when I left was 

1946
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:50,850
what I was,
I was worried about.

1947
01:21:50,851 --> 01:21:51,810
I mean I was,
wasn't,

1948
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:53,543
had just started selling tickets in 
places and then all of a sudden there's 

1949
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:56,874
this clip and then it's going to live 
forever on the Internet of me getting 

1950
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:01,254
booed and there's,
there's stuff up there of comics having 

1951
01:22:03,931 --> 01:22:06,750
bad sets and it didn't help them.
And I'm thinking like,

1952
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:09,850
that's going to happen for me.
I mean,

1953
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:12,930
how do you get booed and it helps your 
career?

1954
01:22:12,931 --> 01:22:13,370
I mean,
I don't,

1955
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:14,203
I mean in this case that did,
but I mean I didn't have any reference 

1956
01:22:17,581 --> 01:22:18,060
to them.

1957
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:19,260
He gets booted.
She was like,

1958
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:20,290
Ooh,
you suck.

1959
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:23,790
Get out of the fucking business.
So I was worried if people were going to

1960
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:27,120
understand the kind of crowd that I was 
in front of.

1961
01:22:27,121 --> 01:22:27,954
Having said that,
like I love Philly crowds and I also 

1962
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:31,740
love the city Adam happy,
you know,

1963
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:33,180
it's sucked up.
My team lost to him,

1964
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:36,050
but I was really happy for them that 
they finally got a superbowl.

1965
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:39,330
Hmm.
Well I loved that moment.

1966
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:42,030
I love everything.
You do the great,

1967
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,340
great cause I turn it around.
Turn around.

1968
01:22:44,341 --> 01:22:45,174
Well we're old.
You uncomfortable that you fucking sit 

1969
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:49,410
there and compliment me.
I almost made it through,

1970
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:51,840
I think in ask them myself.
I got so close.

1971
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:53,970
I had a great time.
I did too.

1972
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:55,860
I really did.
I hope you did.

1973
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:56,723
I'm worried about you.

1974
01:22:58,700 --> 01:22:59,940
I'm playing it up.
Alright.

1975
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,410
But I plan on trying to be funny,
but uh,

1976
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:04,970
we are all worried about him.
Oh my.

1977
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:09,400
No,
it got real doctor and you got something

1978
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,234
to live for,
right?

1979
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:15,100
She was just looking at dogs guys.
Hello?

1980
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:16,210
We sat with him.
He's a great one.

1981
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,700
Bought them.
I bought them from a mill by the way.

1982
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:20,380
Yeah.
And you said,

1983
01:23:20,381 --> 01:23:22,960
I appreciate what you people do here at 
this pub.

1984
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,020
Well,
a instagram photo.

1985
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:28,930
Do you gotta do that?
You steer ready with the receipt area?

1986
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:29,803
Me Fit the puppy mill.
You can't believe how many dogs do you 

1987
01:23:32,501 --> 01:23:34,150
have here?
Oh Man.

1988
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:35,980
By the way.
It was kind of,

1989
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,380
I was surprised when I went to the puppy
mill.

1990
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:40,810
It was a nice wholesome experience.
That guy,

1991
01:23:40,811 --> 01:23:42,640
he really cared about the dogs.
The dogs.

1992
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:44,230
Who did he know you were common or?

1993
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:46,960
I gave him a call and you said you were 
coming.

1994
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:49,510
Wow.
People popped in while we were there.

1995
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:53,370
You think they're just like on chain,
like he was just,

1996
01:23:53,371 --> 01:23:55,060
you didn't see the Bait dogs and all 
that shit.

1997
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,790
Actually it was a breeze.
It was more of a breeder then.

1998
01:23:57,791 --> 01:23:59,120
Like a mall?
Yeah,

1999
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,890
puppy.
In a shredded newspapers situation.

2000
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:04,730
How many dogs are there?
Only two.

2001
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:07,270
They won the week and another one sold 
out.

2002
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,420
No more inventory.
There you go.

2003
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:15,790
You know they outlawed a puppy mills in 
California or not cow in Nla.

2004
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:16,953
You can't sell puppies and Los Angeles.
You have to go to thousand oaks or 

2005
01:24:20,351 --> 01:24:22,570
Orange County.
How about that?

2006
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,970
Didn't know that.
All right.

2007
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:25,893
That's amazing.
I wondered why at the Beverly Center 

2008
01:24:28,001 --> 01:24:29,900
that pet store went away.
Yeah.

2009
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,680
I thought it was because of people 
reacting to that.

2010
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:35,280
Some reason you don't care about the 
fish that are in there though.

2011
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:38,350
The durables and all those other things 
that used to be free.

2012
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:40,090
We only care about dogs.
It is true.

2013
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:43,330
Well dogs need something cause they took
the wolf odd of them.

2014
01:24:43,331 --> 01:24:46,180
So they need somebody to kind of help 
them along.

2015
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:49,510
My dog would not last a day.
No,

2016
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:52,870
not even an hour on his own.
He would be,

2017
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:55,300
you ever seen when they take the fangs 
out of a Cobra?

2018
01:24:55,810 --> 01:24:57,910
No.
I mean I know that doesn't know that.

2019
01:24:57,911 --> 01:25:00,690
So it's still like doing all that shit.
Well that's how they do.

2020
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,250
You never see that one with the baby 
just goes up and grabs a snake.

2021
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,350
They liked,
they did a thing where they like,

2022
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,180
I don't know if they sowed it's fucking 
mouth shut.

2023
01:25:07,181 --> 01:25:08,110
It was.
It was brutal.

2024
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:09,013
Yeah.
But the first time you see you see this 

2025
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:10,804
baby crawling up to a Cobra and you and 
you're like freaking out and then they 

2026
01:25:13,601 --> 01:25:14,434
just,
it's like grabbing onto and the cobras 

2027
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,560
like basically like headbutting most 
aggressive lights blocked.

2028
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,720
Bad lesson for a baby.
By the way.

2029
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,410
Don't play with snakes.
Yeah.

2030
01:25:26,411 --> 01:25:28,750
You would think that would be the 
direction you're going on man.

2031
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:32,260
You know,
like they somehow get pregnant.

2032
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:33,730
Right?
Cause that he's supposed to say it.

2033
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:36,760
You get pregnant like you are a 
seahorse.

2034
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:38,260
Right.
Um,

2035
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:42,640
just yeah,
just steer them away from the snakes.

2036
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:46,240
Have them resend back the snake,
respect the snake river.

2037
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,090
You Little Shit.
And this is my house.

2038
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:54,150
I'm running stuff wrote down.

Yeah.

We'll talk about that.

2078
01:27:13,831 --> 01:27:14,150
Yeah.
