00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,400
Welcome everybody to the [inaudible] 
podcast live.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,040
Here we are again.
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,210
Thank you.
To stitch fix,

4
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,960
quip express Vpn,
an audible for sponsoring this episode.

5
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:18,440
And here I sit with you,
the finest men alive.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,760
The boys,
in fact,

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,080
more,
uh,

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,730
uh,
a charity.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,390
A charitably or lovingly.
Yeah,

10
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:27,730
boys.
Let's say loving English.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,080
The charitable I was,
yeah.

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,450
Anyway,
Jack Films and the common etiquette.

13
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:39,520
God bless them both.
And the soy boy boys are here.

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,400
What is the soy boy?
Exactly?

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,190
Well,
I'm no expert on the matter.

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,850
Uh,
you're the resident.

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,160
I think soy is my favorite insult.
Like it used to be cook.

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,253
We call people to cook.
It's like whether or not you think it 

19
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:01,380
has any power,
you get called a cocky,

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,091
right?
No,

21
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:02,924
I'm not.
Yeah,

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,813
as soy boys even funnier because it's 
just like directly attacking your 

23
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,210
testosterone levels.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,273
You're just not a man.
You are a soy boy who's got soy in your 

25
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:17,060
veins and you don't eat meat.
Now what is the,

26
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,710
Oh,
it's because you're a vegetarian.

27
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,750
I thought it was because soy makes your 
tits bigger.

28
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,200
Yeah.
That's part of the,

29
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,540
it increases estrogen.
Estrogen apparently has estrogen in it.

30
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,823
Wow.
That's,

31
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,140
these guys really know it's a layered 
term.

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
Yeah.
There's a lot going on.

33
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,090
Isn't as popular as cock.
No,

34
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,940
I don't think so.
But it's been on its way for a while.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,833
The stock is rising and falling.
It's hard to genuinely insult somebody 

36
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:47,650
with a phrase like soy boy because it's 
somewhat jovial and a thrilling,

37
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,430
I've met more people who like this shirt
for the message of positivity and soy.

38
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,000
Then I have people who are like,
oh,

39
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,290
that's really cute.
Oh,

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,320
and it's solely demasculated to eat soy 
sauce and these guys Xyz.

41
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,490
Yeah.
They're like,

42
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,880
fuck soy sauce.
Which food?

43
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,420
Overindulges in soy sauce.
And then things was,

44
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:14,670
so I'd be like,
and not like,

45
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,253
oh,
I mean that said their cholesterol is 

46
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,680
probably going to be great because 
that's very high in sodium.

47
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,210
That's true.
It's a health thing.

48
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,730
It might be a health thing for them.
Jack,

49
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,810
how are you?
God bless.

50
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,040
Welcome here.
Thank you.

51
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,470
Very,
um,

52
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,730
you're in the Christmas spirit.
My Dude.

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,593
What?
What makes you say that even your done 

54
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,600
the a Christmas hat section over here.
Back's corner.

55
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,103
I'm trying to get in the spirit because 
I was talking with you a little bit 

56
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:44,060
earlier.
Just I'm not in the Christmas spirit yet

57
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:44,894
and I don't know what,
what the guide is because Christmas is 

58
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:47,204
my favorite freaking holiday and I need 
to like wake up and get in that 

59
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,590
Christmas spirit.
I don't know if it's like,

60
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:52,424
just cause it's an outlay,
but I mean like that you've lived in La 

61
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:55,420
for eight years,
so that should be,

62
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,580
and your previous Christmases had been 
jolly very,

63
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,980
very few percent valley.

64
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,993
Yeah.
I'm usually like writing music and shit 

65
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,880
and now I'm just kinda like,
eh.

66
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,980
So I'm trying to like really get back in
it.

67
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:08,590
So what do you think's going on?
Why is this Christmas?

68
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:09,424
I'm,
the jolly levels are a bit lower than 

69
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,240
previous years.
I don't know.

70
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,550
Cause like back home we're watching all 
of the,

71
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:20,470
all the lifetime hallmark movies,
every single one and each one worse than

72
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,380
the one after.
It's,

73
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,710
it's absurd.
But we're doing that.

74
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:25,820
We got all the ornaments and stuff.
Uh,

75
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,973
you guys get gifts to each other where I
think this year we're not going to do 

76
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,770
gifts.
We're just kind of over the gifts thing,

77
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,900
but we usually do.
Is that part of the problem?

78
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,320
Yeah,
that's it.

79
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,240
We're not doing yet.
No.

80
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,093
He's like,
dude,

81
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,760
he's like,
dude,

82
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,620
it's so much more than that.
Well,

83
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,410
what does it mean to be in the Christmas
spirit?

84
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,180
Because I'm a,
I'm a young Jewish boy.

85
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,170
Eric,
are you Jewish?

86
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,011
No,
I'm a,

87
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:49,000
I do.
I do Christmas,

88
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,020
but I'm,
I'm with Jack.

89
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,210
I'm not feeling the spirit right now.
You were a Jew.

90
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,073
Can I say that?
Because you've got your name and your 

91
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,540
last name is off.
Cut that out and half,

92
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,060
half the comments on my youtube channel 
or people calling me that.

93
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:06,061
So everyone gets it.
That's almost as prevalent as toy.

94
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:08,891
Yeah.
Well,

95
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:13,270
they're all the comments to one to get a
combo.

96
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,240
So explain to me a young,
sweet Jewish lad.

97
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,150
Yes.
What does it mean the Christmas spirit?

98
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:21,280
Because my dad has always been a bit of 
a grinch.

99
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,650
Christmas spirit was taken from me.
It helps.

100
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,000
It helps if you just crank the music out
like as loud as you can in every room.

101
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,093
You know you do that well we have 
previously so sometimes I would just 

102
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:39,680
like and just play Christmas music.

103
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,110
So let me tell you what's Christmas.
Oh man,

104
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,140
it's a whole world of the Alexa.
Okay.

105
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,143
Oh it's lovely.
I think I might get an back in Israel 

106
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,103
like the half that stuff is not cool you
and not going to play that God know God 

107
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,743
help us all.
It's because they didn't do an electric 

108
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:05,080
violin version of it for like a snickers
commercial.

109
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,340
That thing has been playing for like 20 
years.

110
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,990
Trans Siberian orchestra style.
Is that what it is?

111
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,150
Just to kind of like the rock and roll 
shit.

112
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,270
Is that the band that does it though?
It's like I,

113
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,163
so I always get them confused.
Trans Siberian orchestra and then 

114
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:21,570
there's another one and I'm sure you 
guys online,

115
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,660
you know what I'm talking about.
I get them mixed up,

116
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,310
but they were both like very synth 
heavy,

117
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,720
you know that one is a transfer.
Transunion,

118
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,583
you nailed it.

119
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,510
The Trans Siberian.
Okay.

120
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,640
And that's like they do this,
you know,

121
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,593
very meaty carol of the bells and that's
where they have like the electric 

122
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:36,040
guitar,
that kind of,

123
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,223
yeah,
I feel like you're getting in the 

124
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,830
Christmas spirit.
Well see,

125
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,501
okay.
You have it.

126
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:42,334
And I don't know.
I don't because when I hear Christmas 

127
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:46,060
music on the radio,
I,

128
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,680
I get angry because I swerved at that 
because like my favorite station is like

129
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,910
I listened to all these on the radio and
then when November or when like,

130
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:56,470
yeah,
November after Thanksgiving,

131
00:05:56,471 --> 00:06:00,290
all the way through the new year.
It's the same cricon Christmas music and

132
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,450
I want to hit,
I don't want to hear that shit.

133
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,700
I want to hear actual music that I want 
here.

134
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,260
It's just once a year.
Yeah,

135
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:10,550
swallowed up just one month of the year.
It's like one 12th of my whole year.

136
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,270
No,
the radio was grover late October.

137
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,570
Right.
It's a whole pillar.

138
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:15,404
They pick it up a little bit.
Like they've got to figure it I think 

139
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:18,560
doing Christmas a long time.
But there is,

140
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,423
I think Hanukkah music is neglected.
I mean Paul Mccartney never wrote a 

141
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:23,620
Hanukkah.
I mean,

142
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,670
everybody's not on the Christmas.
I'm digging into my own Rolodex.

143
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Paul Mccartney wrote Christmas Christmas
song.

144
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,710
What's that really famous one?
He didn't write a Hanukkah song.

145
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,690
He did write a Christmas,
his famous,

146
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,280
Oh God,
that one.

147
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,290
Well man,
I this man,

148
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,770
I'm to get claim just for humming it.
I love Paul Mccartney,

149
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:50,640
Sir Paul Mccartney,
sir.

150
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,460
To you crunch.
He was knighted.

151
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,470
But that song sucks.
I'm sorry.

152
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,363
Yeah.
Wow.

153
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,181
Look,
Paul Mccartney,

154
00:06:56,181 --> 00:07:00,320
but that to Paul Mccartney's bullet 
bourbon boys.

155
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,160
It's going to take like hot swigs out of
that thing.

156
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,510
What do you want?
Do you guys want,

157
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:07,390
can we get some glasses in here for the 
boys please?

158
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,480
Zola.
I'm good.

159
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,900
Thank you.
Just going to hit that damn skinny Erin.

160
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,640
Badge it.
Look at me.

161
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,510
Pull it apart.
I'm intrigued though by your,

162
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,440
you're having what seems to be an 
existential crisis in your life.

163
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,040
Yeah,
just lack of,

164
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,760
I'm just in a weird,
weird shape right now.

165
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,040
It's the Christmas thing.
It's a whole creativity thing,

166
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,570
you know,
burnout,

167
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,020
but it's just,
it's just figuring all that shit.

168
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,080
So I,
I've been through this in my,

169
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,680
in my personal life so many times in my 
career and youtube,

170
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,873
but I'm fascinated by it.
It's kind of a self feeding cycle in a 

171
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:47,924
sense.
Are you getting negative comments from 

172
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:50,474
your fans?
Is that feeding it or like are they 

173
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,640
supportive?
They've,

174
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,703
lately they've been extremely supportive
and very thankful for that and they 

175
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:57,944
just,
they've been giving me some pretty 

176
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,510
solid,
uh,

177
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,690
constructive criticism in the past just 
because my,

178
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,803
my videos,
I've just been very stagnant and 

179
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,760
quantity or quality I should say.

180
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,970
Is that part of the issue for you?
That is the issue for me.

181
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,740
I just like,
how do I get out of this Rut?

182
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,690
Because all my videos are like a month 
ago,

183
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:17,360
how many theaters were the same and I 
hated where I was at and so it's like,

184
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,800
how do I get out of there?
So I'm trying new stuff and getting back

185
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,310
in the groove slowly.
But you know,

186
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,290
it's,
it's not perfect.

187
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,350
I'm fighting it.
What,

188
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,120
what do you do when you're in a Rut?
I was when I'm in a Rut.

189
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,013
Yeah.
Well I was going to say I don't know 

190
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:31,540
what to do.
Oh for,

191
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,640
well no I'm not really.
I was like what's up?

192
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,800
What's the opposite of a rough?
What stops it over Rut of role?

193
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,170
A role.
I'll do it.

194
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,043
I'm in a role in a role,
I'm going to roll down the hill from a 

195
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,320
help.

196
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,180
I'm rolling down a hill,
I'm on fire.

197
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,660
You're never in a fucking towards a Rut.
You don't post enough to be in a rush.

198
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,543
No,
that's true.

199
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,180
Definitely.
I guess that would help.

200
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,350
I guess that would help.
But why don't you,

201
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,140
you're not going to post more.
That will not happen.

202
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:01,500
Well I think in my cleaning,
you know who would,

203
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,190
what would help that along is if I had 
like a studio.

204
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,840
Cause right now I film everything in my 
room.

205
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,703
Right.
But if I had like a dedicated space I 

206
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:12,300
could go to and film things in,
uh,

207
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,760
I just like overthink shit before I 
start filming it.

208
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,623
Which wouldn't that give like a place,
would that give you incentive to like 

209
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,970
get out of bed and go to work?
It's so weird to like,

210
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,930
cause I wake up and then,
oh that's where I'm going all day.

211
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,190
It's just my chair recreation in your 
work and your personal life.

212
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,750
This,
this isn't my fed anymore.

213
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:34,330
This is my tripod and I used to be our 
apartment in New York.

214
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,210
It was really rough.
Like yeah,

215
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,220
it's your living room,
your bedroom,

216
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,160
your work wrong.
Everything.

217
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,640
It's nicely.
One tiny.

218
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,840
Yeah.
But you've got ac in there I believe in.

219
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,990
I do finally,
finally got a seat.

220
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,923
Awesome.
But I'm never going to use it too 

221
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,930
offensive or what?
No,

222
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:56,070
I just like being sweaty so I just want 
it to have it.

223
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,730
I'll use it when I'm editing,
but I will say,

224
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,080
um,
Jack,

225
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,920
the will smith fit you made was 
fantastic.

226
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,800
The comments were great.
Everyone was very happy.

227
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:08,634
That must've made you feel jolly.
That put me in the Christmas spirit 

228
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:12,570
right away.
That's true.

229
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,453
Certainly helps.
I don't know if that was great seeing 

230
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:15,270
the feedback.

231
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,200
Like so many comments were like the old 
Jack is back and that's,

232
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,034
to me that's the highest praise cause 
that's where I'm trying to get back to 

233
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,180
outcomes on wonder if that's like,
cause I've been there,

234
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,250
people have been telling me they miss 
the old ethan forever,

235
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,990
but it's have like case from the dragon 
to hear that.

236
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,490
I hate hearing that even when it's in a 
good way because they mean the best.

237
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:39,270
But it's still,
it's a double edge to compliment.

238
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,040
You don't want to,
you need to,

239
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,133
you just,
it's hard not to look back but you kind 

240
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:45,840
of have to not,
yeah,

241
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,400
you shouldn't,
it.

242
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,323
I think it's amb because well first off 
senses of humor do evolve over time and 

243
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,430
shit.
I found funding five years ago,

244
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:55,320
even two years ago.
I don't find funny now.

245
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,670
I find it funny in a different way.

246
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,923
I do feel like sometimes I,
I gotta go back in the archives and 

247
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:04,530
figure out what was I doing back then 
that was that I just wouldn't even think

248
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,120
of.
Sometimes it's like that's where he gets

249
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,440
explained.
Know what it was.

250
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,810
I find when I look back on my live 
videos,

251
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,570
it's not so much that like I was doing 
something,

252
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,404
it's just,
it's really about the state of mind 

253
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,520
because you're in a healthy place in 
your mind,

254
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,270
you doubt yourself less.
You question yourself less and you're,

255
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,133
when you're,
I find that when I'm in a better head 

256
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,460
space,
I'm always making better stuff.

257
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,593
So I've found that it's very much about 
how I'm feeling rather than something 

258
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:36,770
specifically I'm doing.
And you kind of like just fearlessly,

259
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,990
just like making shit and moving on.
Yeah.

260
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,430
I liked that.
I liked that.

261
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,323
I,
I just get in these like that's a good 

262
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:45,390
way to put it.
Cause I do,

263
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:47,760
I pace around the house like all day.
It's just,

264
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:48,990
it's,
it's sad.

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,833
Right.
Are you just trying to think of ideas 

266
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,530
and I'm talking to myself,
fleshing out ideas and jokes.

267
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,990
Is this funny and will this work?
Um,

268
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,010
and uh,
yeah,

269
00:11:57,011 --> 00:12:00,880
being in the right state of mind I think
would work wonders in therapy.

270
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,710
I am not in therapy personally.
Um,

271
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,630
but for me it's been huge because I been
in a,

272
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,110
and I always thought of therapy has 
some,

273
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:11,300
like I was like,
Ooh,

274
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,970
fucking smell your own asshole while 
you're at it.

275
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:14,804
Therapy.
But I swear to God it's helped me a lot 

276
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,853
and I think it actually helped me get 
out of my rut because there's so much 

277
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,730
other shit going on.
It's,

278
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,913
it's hard to,
it's really so hard to step out of 

279
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,700
yourself and see what's the actual 
problem.

280
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,510
It's a lot of the times the real problem
is not something that you are addressing

281
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:33,344
or even aware of.
And that honestly has been really 

282
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,783
valuable to me.

283
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,990
How once a week,
twice a year,

284
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,550
I go once a week.
He tells me I need to come twice a week,

285
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:45,550
but he's like,
you really ought to come twice a week,

286
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:46,384
dude.
You're fucked up.

287
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,290
You did therapy or no,
but I have,

288
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,400
you have,
it's great.

289
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:54,060
You're cured.
You know,

290
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,443
it's like a,
it's like pausing your netflix 

291
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,184
subscription.
There's just nothing on right now that 

292
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:00,210
it needs my attention.
Yeah,

293
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:01,510
I got it.
That's beautiful metaphor.

294
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:02,290
But,
uh,

295
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,550
yeah,
there's,

296
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,310
there shouldn't be a stigma about 
therapy even though the,

297
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,263
you know,
people like to put one there just 

298
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,310
because it's like,
well I'm not going to one,

299
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:10,990
so I must be good.
And then a week later,

300
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,140
like their grandma dies and it's like,
yeah,

301
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,260
I you,
she might want to unravel that yarn.

302
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,210
Yeah.
Are you,

303
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,190
why,
is there a reason you haven't considered

304
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:23,080
therapy or you just felt like you 
haven't needed it

305
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,323
but you never get over the ladder?
I've just never put much thought into 

306
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:27,544
it.
It's not that I don't believe in it 

307
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,320
cause I,
I,

308
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,610
I'm,
I'm sure it would do me good.

309
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,940
It's just one of those,
I just haven't pursued it because it's a

310
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:37,000
whole thing.
It's a whole thing and I'm not,

311
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:38,620
and I'm not knocking it.
I'm sure I could,

312
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,050
I could absolutely benefit from it.
I just,

313
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,740
I dunno,
I feel like I got to figure,

314
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,020
I don't know,
I say I got to figure it out,

315
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:49,060
but I know therapy would help if it,
well the thing is

316
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,370
stuck in a Rut for so long and I was at,
I was just,

317
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,240
I wasn't like super irritable and I was 
super just like,

318
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,663
like I was always trying to get out of 
it and run and run and run and I was 

319
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,310
just running like a hamster wheel.
I don't know if this is your situation,

320
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,310
I'm just totally on my own person,
but I felt like I was in a hamster wheel

321
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:10,890
for like a whole year just running and 
was getting worse and worse and worse.

322
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,753
Yeah.
And so I just had like a breaking point 

323
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:13,644
where I started taking medicine and 
started going to therapy and I think 

324
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:21,090
that was like three months ago.
But I tell you that life change you.

325
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,630
That's fantastic man.
I guess,

326
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,030
I mean what was the story is not your 
therapist coming on the show cut.

327
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,740
Actually,
I think I hear him laughing back.

328
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,240
Good dance.
My staff.

329
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,470
You want to make sure I love that one.
Okay.

330
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,190
Yeah.
All right.

331
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,750
The last time I went to him,
he's like,

332
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,160
I really think you should come twice a 
week.

333
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,591
I was like,
man,

334
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:47,910
I don't,
it's too much.

335
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,813
Yeah,
you got to have your foot down 

336
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:51,030
somewhere.
Oh Wow.

337
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,100
Holy.

338
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,570
So I'm not supposed to drink alcohol,
but I'm also don't want to be a grinch.

339
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,490
Well either.
Definitely can't drink all,

340
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,070
but she's got a bun in the oven and 
you're not drinking.

341
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:02,670
She's drinking.
I'm not drinking cause my,

342
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,410
cause apparently on antidepressants 
you're not supposed to drink alcohol,

343
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,080
but does anyone really care about that?
I apologize.

344
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,760
Oh,
here's me and Jack's therapy.

345
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,000
That's to that.
Cheers down the hat.

346
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,490
Bad luck.
Bad luck did not.

347
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:25,580
Here's another alcohol drink.
It's like a dyno.

348
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,230
So pregnant women cursing look.
So I just avoid ladders.

349
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:31,220
That's all I'm going to say.
Okay.

350
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,470
Who Curse too?
Did I curse you or did you curse me?

351
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:34,821
Well,
I have the alcohol,

352
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:39,740
so I think we're all cars.
All right.

353
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:41,540
You guys want to watch some of it?
You want to watch some shit?

354
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,590
I know for this,
uh,

355
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,210
show me the videos.

356
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,800
What's the,
what's good on the,

357
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,170
what's going on the Boob tube man?
Have you seen youtube?

358
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,180
Rewind,
rewind.

359
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,920
What's that?
Uh,

360
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,420
I actually haven't seen that.
I saw,

361
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,400
I think eric and walk the fuck is in 
there for me.

362
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,350
Should we walk in together and we watch 
together or is that old news?

363
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,090
I feel like everybody,
my password is all,

364
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,570
I mean we can get eric's live grashen at
Youtube.

365
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:11,630
We want,
that's pretty special.

366
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,180
Interesting.
I don't know if it's redundant.

367
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,520
I'll just be staring into this camera.
Like it's the office,

368
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,910
the whole,
um,

369
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,273
oh,
I do want to make a couple of 

370
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,524
announcements before we proceed.
Tuesday's our big annual charity stream 

371
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:27,134
with Justin Reuland alk search.
We've got it bigger and badder than 

372
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,650
ever.
So,

373
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,513

guitar signed for the Raffle as well as 

374
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:35,990
many other items.

375
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,943
Joey Salads is here.
He's going to eat progressively hotter 

376
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:39,824
peppers at every milestone.
We have a little kiddie pool full of 

377
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:44,690
milk.
He's going to put on a life vest,

378
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,760
little rubber duckies and a whole scoop 
of gear.

379
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,660
Sit in a pool of milk and eat 
progressively hotter peppers all the way

380
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:53,090
up to Carolina reaper.
No,

381
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,400
he's flying in for this.
Yeah,

382
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:57,800
this is a big event.
This is huge.

383
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:02,801
Can I be the set medic?
You're qualified fire extinguisher.

384

ace treat podcast.
Let's hope this looks so different.

386
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,073
God,
it's going to be,

387
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,013
it's going to be rough.
Senior submissions to 

388
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:22,340
podcast@atriusreproductions.com
for your best and worst.

389
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,380
So let's skip.
Let's skip youtube.

390
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:26,900
Rewind.
Let's uh oh,

391
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:30,890
this is amazing.
So this year you guys are going,

392
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,753
this is amazing.
Mark Walberg you know it's funny to see 

393
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:38,680
mark these days cause we saw him 
recently in a movie with Tom Segura.

394
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,523
What was the name of that movie?
That instant family and he's a great 

395
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,190
movie and it's such a wholesome,
fun and he's such,

396
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:50,160
he's got this wholesome vibe now.
But here's mark back in the nine.

397
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,660
Real goofy,
pretty boy.

398
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,263
Listen to how he talks.
He throws on like an accent but then he 

399
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:58,230
drops a line in here that is will become
iconic.

400
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,830
Sounds goes out to my man Calvin Klein.
Good looking out for the drawers.

401
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:04,664
Not Saying I would do it.
Not the fruit of the loom commercial or 

402
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:08,150
nothing like that.
Cause they don't make the hype shorts.

403
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,740
These,
these are the nineties man.

404
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,690
They just fit good and it hold,
hold me,

405
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,080
snuck.
So from about to go get some skins,

406
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm not going to put on like no silk 
underwear.

407
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,380
Oh she got freckles.

408
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,260
He talks like a youtube pranksters who 
she got freckles.

409
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:23,010
She got freckles.
Light gets better.

410
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,683
There's no other way.
He's definitely got like a sock in his 

411
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:28,210
pants.
Look at that lump look.

412
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:29,940
Fix My poop.
He's got a big one.

413
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,970
Yeah,
not that big.

414
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:35,660
It looks like an egg plant.
You're right.

415
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,790
It's cool.
It's just a fucking that shit.

416
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,960
And I don't think it's supposed to fit 
like a diaper dude.

417
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,770
Fucking mount vesuvius down there.
But here we go.

418
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,850
The real one does edits when they 
removed the music to make it awkward.

419
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,750
Hi,
this is,

420
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,340
this is real is again,
I thought it was just like,

421
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,223
Oh really?
The nineties that's just how they did 

422
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:58,044
it.
Yeah.

423
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,770
The middle of our money on mark.
This is real.

424
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:02,870
Like a real APP.
Yes.

425
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,840
Oh,
okay.

426
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,673
Here it comes.

427
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,550
No,
the best protection against a,

428
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,890
just to keep the cow and so on.

429
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,040
That's protecting against AIDS.
Keep your Calvin's on.

430
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,373
Well,
does that mean if he puts his dick 

431
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:19,990
through the hole,
then who doesn't get aids?

432
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,420
Maybe it's the kind that doesn't 
separate.

433
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:26,170
You know there's so many things wrong.
Well yeah,

434
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:27,130
sure.
We can unpack.

435
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:28,900
Mostly you could still get aids with 
those on,

436
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,860
I guarantee it.
They're using like the aids scare of the

437
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:35,370
nineties to sell fucking underwear.
Yeah.

438
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,250
That's outstanding.
Girl.

439
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,741
You got,
hey,

440
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,070
it's doesn't matter.
You sit on your couch.

441
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,320
You're good.
Yo Baby,

442
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:44,290
let me fuck you through my calvins.
Believeable that's the body.

443
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,630
Calvin's best way to prevent AIDS is 
keep it on your couch.

444
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,250
I guess he's saying as you promoting 
celibacy,

445
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,020
is that what he's doing?
What is that like?

446
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:54,400
Not having sex?
Keeping us.

447
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,234
Andy feels like flirting with her.
The message doesn't make sense cause 

448
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,364
he's absolutely promoting celibacy and 
yet at the same time he just wants a 

449
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,334
hand guy.

450
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,700
Yeah,
that's the wine they cut out at the end.

451
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,120
The suite to prevent aids.
Get a hand guy.

452
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:11,850
I'm Marty.
No,

453
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,820
another take.
Okay.

454
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,470
Oh okay.
That wasn't,

455
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,530
that was what does Nancy Reagan knew me 
to say seriously or wait,

456
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:27,260
who was it that was,
cause guys remember like in sex ed every

457
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,690
time it was like,
okay,

458
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:32,560
here's the different steps of protection
you can take but really don't have sex.

459
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,463
Right.
Absolutely.

460
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,020
What is the time I had some wild lessons
in sex ed.

461
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:41,530
Did you guys like I had one teacher,
I had a lot of conservative teachers.

462
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,364
I don't know why.
One teacher told our whole class 

463
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,460
straight up,
she said,

464
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,920
guys,
women do not sex.

465
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,980
I'm telling you right now the female 
orgasm is a myth.

466
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Whoa darth.
She told her whole class,

467
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,530
she's like,
women do not enjoy sex and I had watched

468
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:58,720
a lot of porn in my life by then and I 
was like,

469
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,070
that is not the impression I got.

470
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,860
And I and I,
well I know porn oversells it,

471
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,200
but I was really common ties with that 
cause I was like,

472
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:06,670
Whoa,
like what a terrible thing.

473
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,840
I'll never forget it.
So just,

474
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:12,230
you know,
get yours all rate.

475
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:18,150
I mean kind of I guess.
I guess her point was that you put it in

476
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,170
and make a baby and then you take it 
out.

477
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,680
She got her across shit wrong.
Neither party should enjoy it.

478
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,163
Abstinence,
that was what they always called it in 

479
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:29,224
sex ed.
I went to be abstinent Catholic middle 

480
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:31,624
school and that was absolutely,
what did they tell you about condoms at 

481
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,740
all?
They did,

482
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:38,920
but they were heavily frowned upon.
Just just don't do it.

483
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:43,580
Like if you absolutely have to sin,
they put like fish hooks through it.

484
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,520
Just how they come.
Yeah,

485
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,700
we call it these are condoms,
Aka Satan's hand mouth.

486
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,540
Right.
The heat up real hot.

487
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,470
They burn you and they only have a 50% 
success rate.

488
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,430
Just don't even try children.
We call these Satan's butthole.

489
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,110
It's like putting your Dick and Satan's 
butthole.

490
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:04,090
When you put a condom on,
school's great,

491
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,710
but he's there.
What was sex ed like in Israel?

492
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,820
It was like one class where they teach 
you,

493
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,540
I mean,
not like a onetime session,

494
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,500
they're just like,
here we go,

495
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,310
guys,
birds and bees.

496
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,143
One would come like not that teacher or 
someone else would come and they'd 

497
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:24,550
demonstrate like a cute come there.
I'm like,

498
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,393
oh yeah,
it's like straight out of like freaks 

499
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:30,430
and kick.
I don't really remember it.

500
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:33,640
This is a very short,
then everyone was feeling awkward.

501
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,493
Yeah.
I remember they showed us gnarly 

502
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:39,450
pictures of like std written penises.
Really?

503
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,560
That oh yeah.
Like unbelievable.

504
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:45,520
Like projector,
like real big guys.

505
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,533
Like a penis.
Like the only way I can describe it as 

506
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:51,520
like a lion's mane of chlamydia,
they would only show,

507
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:52,600
I see illustrations.

508
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:56,963
Yeah,
I know.

509
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,283
Yeah.
I'd be a lot happier and healthier 

510
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,400
today.
Or if it was,

511
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,920
we got illustrations,
Jack would be in the Christmas spirit.

512
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,260
Reminds me,
I have that clear.

513
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,000
Which the situation,
I know he taught.

514
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:12,923
He taught it.
Yeah.

515
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,220
So,
oh,

516
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:16,660
about the celibacy.
Yeah,

517
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,700
of course.
I'm sorry.

518
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:21,300
I'm the situation indicating celibacy 
while,

519
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:25,810
so it was a sweet message cause um,
you had on one hand,

520
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:26,980
uh,
what's her name?

521
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,700
The girl who ran with uh,
uh,

522
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,563
Mccain Pailin,
Sarah Palin's daughter who has like 

523
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:39,781
three kids out of wedlock advocating for
celibacy and then the,

524
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,770
she might hit you get it.
That might get people to be sellable.

525
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,490
I mean you're a hypocrite,
but don't gain right.

526
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,420
Here we go.
Let's see.

527
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,570
The situation may have watched it on the
podcast.

528
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:58,460
So we have Washington did a long time 
ago.

529
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,140
Yeah.
Did you guys know that?

530
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,080
If he called Mark Walberg Marky mark,
he gets really mad.

531
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,610
No,
I didn't like that.

532
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,563
Oh really?
But that should be like a term of 

533
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:08,060
endearment.
Like it's a nickname.

534
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,340
I think it's like a rebranding thing.
He's just like,

535
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,480
oh,
shut up and names.

536
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,823
By the way,
you know when he was young he like beat 

537
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:15,910
the shit of a Chinese guy.
Made a blind.

538
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,960
Yeah,
I read about a lot of trouble for that.

539
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,040
Some did blind,
right.

540
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,940
I don't,
I think he's like,

541
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,840
he's handled that by just like burying 
it,

542
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:27,560
but like,
it,

543
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,740
it keeps coming up every couple of years
on reddit where people,

544
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,360
like today I learned Marky Mark,
uh,

545
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,510
nearly killed the guy.
Did you know,

546
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,660
here's the one with the crazy schedule,
right?

547
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,793
Yeah.
Story.

548
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,750
Mr 3:00
AM I don't get that.

549
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,370
You don't have to wake up at 3:00
AM.

550
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:44,360
That doesn't impress me.

551
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,760
You can wake up at 6:00
AM and still do as much.

552
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,501
What's a,
what?

553
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:49,180
What was his bedtime if you woke up at 
three?

554
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,310
We watch that as much.
That anything to watch.

555
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,660
This is a still photo,
right?

556
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,600
Grand Post.
Like a picture of his schedule.

557
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,553
Oh,
I thought he had a video talking about 

558
00:24:58,251 --> 00:24:59,870
it for a bit with him.
They like,

559
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,733
he,
I think the host James Corden and tried 

560
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:05,450
to um,
like live a life,

561
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,540
live it day in the life of Mark Walberg 
view of that whole sketch.

562
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,660
It was like I'm trending throughout the 
fucking morning.

563
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,340
Believable.
Well that's just not,

564
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:14,750
that's not admirable.
That's just,

565
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,860
that's lunacy.
Yeah,

566
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,510
it is.
Vanity is what it is.

567
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,720
What time do you go to bed when you wake
up at three kids and shit.

568
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,140
It's eight.
You don't live a life.

569
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,810
If you only ate like earlier,
you don't.

570
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,520
You work on picture day.
I mean like I don't believe that this is

571
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:33,740
a daily schedule for the guy.
Maybe when he's like,

572
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,183
I don't know,
Mark Wahlberg's insane workout schedule 

573
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:41,570
starts at two 30 in the morning.
That's ridiculous.

574
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,010
Is this guy superhuman?
Well,

575
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:43,844
no.
He just goes to bed at eight like a 

576
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:46,820
fucking nine year old.
What a what?

577
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:47,990
A nerd.
What a point.

578
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,030
He goes to bed at seven 30 he looked 
correct.

579
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:53,864
The record.
Imagine going to bed at seven 30 Oh my 

580
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:56,894
God.
Imagine being famous and wealthy and 

581
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:00,344
achieving everything you've ever wanted 
in life and going to bed at seven 30 

582
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,650
doesn't that undermine El success?
My night doesn't start til like 10 more.

583
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,920
There's a picture of the schedule right 
here.

584
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:12,950
We got a typical daily schedule.
Cryo chamber.

585
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,813
I'm sorry,
that was the first thing that cryo 

586
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:17,480
chamber recall.
That's the secret,

587
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,780
right?
It's prayer time.

588
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:22,080
Beg,
but nine to 45 Scott,

589
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,120
thank God he prays for 30 minutes.
That's a,

590
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:29,810
that's a hell of the prayer.
He's got the rosary and a half.

591
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:30,644
God,
please don't let me get in more trouble 

592
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:33,030
for that shit.
That guy,

593
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,570
please Jesus.
Please don't call me Marky mark today.

594
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,380
They dropped dead.
Oh,

595
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,500
I'll make him blind.
Dear Lord.

596
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,020
Post workout meal,
shower,

597
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,854
golf.
This motherfucker's got time to pray at 

598
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,194
golf.
Okay.

599
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,660
But to be fair,
nobody calls for 30 minutes,

600
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,090
half hour.
So something that he does,

601
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,530
he's,
he's whacking off something else now.

602
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,500
It's probably got a little tea.
Maybe like a little,

603
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,210
a green background or something.
Yeah.

604
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,970
Yeah.
It's just time and golf at home.

605
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,863
He's got 30 minutes for a snack.
What a cutie pie or does he have like a 

606
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:10,070
box of juice and some crackers?
No,

607
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:10,261
no,
no,

608
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:10,411
no,
no,

609
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:11,161
no.
That's wrong.

610
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:14,190
He has an hour and a half of snack time.
Oh my God.

611
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:15,024
It's 90 minutes.
Boys allocate that time more to golf or 

612
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:19,854
something.
And then he has another snack 

613
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,720
immediately after that.
So he's just usually snacking.

614
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,573
All want to live in it up and he's 
definitely a snacking in the cryo 

615
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,950
chamber.
Like what else do you do in there?

616
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,990
Isn't there for an hour?
Yeah.

617
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,460
Yeah.
11:00

618
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,300
AM family time.
It's like,

619
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,240
all right,
everybody gather around.

620
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,880
We go way our,
well careful.

621
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,700
He also has a sandwich in meetings and 
work calls,

622
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:46,860
so it's family time,
but he's on the phone the whole time.

623
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,970
Oh,
I loved how filling.

624
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,380
They don't even get their own hour.
Yeah,

625
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,580
but it doesn't take an hour for lunch.
He has marky mark.

626
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:00,031
He's like,
okay,

627
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:03,270
everybody leave lunch tonight.
We made fun of a lot of people,

628
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,223
the four of us when we're all together,
but this is the first time I've been 

629
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:06,714
afraid that like they're going to kick 
this fucking door down and just 

630
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,260
[inaudible] it'll make you blind in one 
eye.

631
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,680
Are Making the jokes about me.
Huh?

632
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,850
Real sensitive voice of the apes.
I heard you guys were the,

633
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,693
he's got kind of a Mike Tyson thing with
a real sensitive was I thought you guys 

634
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:21,630
were making jokes about me.

635
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,160
I just want to tell you,
he has like the sensitive,

636
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,793
I just want to tell you guys get across 
that it's not cool that you guys making 

637
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:29,814
fun of me.
He looks like he's always explaining to 

638
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:34,610
a kid why they can't buy a present.
Wow.

639
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,160
Is that really accurate?
I just don't even get that right.

640
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,033
Right.
And it was like your mom's going to see 

641
00:28:43,451 --> 00:28:44,284
you come back with,
it's just can be really mad and that's 

642
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,550
solid nail.
Can I say something though?

643
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,400
I actually loved that shtick.
I'm very charmed by it.

644
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,420
Yeah.
The ship being white,

645
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:57,450
his voice,
no one has like sensitive tough guy.

646
00:28:57,451 --> 00:28:58,770
I love that character.
So I'm,

647
00:28:58,771 --> 00:28:59,511
oh,
I fall for it.

648
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:00,550
Write books.
All the big C book.

649
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,990
I worked on a movie that he was in.
Tell me about the experience.

650
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:05,640
It was a,
the lovely bones,

651
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,710
the loveliest,
the lovely bones.

652
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,783
I was like,
uh,

653
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:09,923
an additional PA crew member swing guy 
in there somewhere and got to like a 

654
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,343
weekend.
But I got to see him walking around on 

655
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:18,330
set.
I'll tell you,

656
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:20,250
he was always in a good mood.
He was whistling,

657
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:22,170
singing a cup,
coffee in his hand,

658
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,490
just bopping along like the little soy 
soy boy.

659
00:29:24,491 --> 00:29:28,810
I'm sure he was like this dude was,
he really got a stain on it.

660
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,530
I really should have gotten this thing 
dry clean before the stain does not come

661
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:32,364
with this.
I don't think you need to dry clean 

662
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:39,570
that.
I mean cause Nah so positive.

663
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,100
He probably goes in his trailer

664
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,630
and like punches punching someone in the
face.

665
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,790
I like to warn me about like eye contact
or anything like that.

666
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,960
Did you hear about with celebrities but 
right,

667
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,813
right.
Just looking at it wrong.

668
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,280
That's a weird,
that's required.

669
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,880
Don't make I Oakland like there's 
stories about that's appearance Hannity.

670
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,610
Really super good actor.
Who liked did Lincoln,

671
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,730
what's his name?
Daniel Day Lewis.

672
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,170
No eye contact.
No,

673
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,910
the opposite.
Uh,

674
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,010
eye contact.
All right.

675
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:12,844
If that was accurate as needed then like
the best actor would need that for like 

676
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,730
his method acting.
It's like I get it.

677
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:20,770
You look him in the eyes.
He fucks up his character shit.

678
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,720
But he was like between takes on 
Lincoln,

679
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,570
just like chilling with the crew and 
like telling stories and stuff and can,

680
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:27,360
there we go.
All right.

681
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,600
No,
just out of character.

682
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,303
It was like,
all right,

683
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,350
let's go again.

684
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,840
And he said,
oh,

685
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,430
I'm thinking,
wow.

686
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,170
So I mean maybe that's just how good he 
is.

687
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,063
That's a problem.
It makes me doubt the whole eye contact 

688
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:39,580
thing that it's like a performance 
issue.

689
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,473
Oh yeah.
There's actors being divas on that 

690
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,650
point.
What do I know him?

691
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,630
Well,
I swapped boy command.

692
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,680
I don't allow Ian to look me in the eye.
Yeah,

693
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:51,400
but that's like dominance thing.
I just feel like I have to,

694
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:53,981
I'm just like,
whoa.

695
00:30:53,981 --> 00:30:56,860
Even careful with that.
I contacted,

696
00:30:56,861 --> 00:30:58,810
I already warned you twice.
You just like,

697
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,070
all right,
we're going to take a break.

698
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,090
Fans yelling at me.

699
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,620
Nice.
We're going to take a quick break.

700
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:05,560
We'll be right back.
The boys are just back in town and we're

701
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:06,394
only beginning.
We've only watched like one video of 

702
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,520
100,000.
That's right.

703
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:14,440
We'll be right back.

00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:21,340

Now Dan's got a sweater he got from them

707
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,820
that he frankly has never taken off and 
it looks good on them.

708
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,680
It's like they read your mind and said,
hey,

709
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,690
this is the perfect sweater for Dan.
Dan,

710
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:30,490

736
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:43,334
perfect bristles because gums are

your gums because let me tell you about 
gums folks.

They do not grow back and you're going

739
00:32:50,641 --> 00:32:51,050
like,

00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,550
I wish I listened to Ethan and got to 
quit.

741
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,713
Not only that,
it tells you when to switch sides so it 

742
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:56,480
vibrates vibe,
fry rates.

743

This is my favorite to approach.
I will not use any other toothbrush.

747
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:07,963
It's also got a tongue scraper on the 
back so you can get all of that nasty 

748

What would it look like if we all 
listened to more?

791
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,640
Well,
listening to audio books motivates,

792
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,590
sets inspire as us and even brings us 
closer together.

793
00:35:24,591 --> 00:35:25,424
And if you'll recall,
I asked Jordan Peterson our audio books 

794
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:29,780
as good as reading and he said yes,
of course.

795
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,930
I wondered that they're just as good 
baby even better.

how was the break for you guys?
You guys all enjoyed yourselves and it 

837
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:40,590
was really nice break.
I actually didn't want it to end bonding

838
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,950
to go back to sleep.
Please.

839
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,503
Actually I brought my oh switch.
If we could just play a little smashed 

840
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:47,740
for a couple of hours.
Have you been playing smash?

841
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,220
All I want to be absolutely.
Absolutely.

842
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,420
Get out of the eye line down.
I know you guys don't look at me.

843
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,630
Don't look,
oh wait,

844
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,623
wait.
So what does being in someone's eyeline 

845
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,873
mean?
Cause that doesn't even sound like 

846
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,230
making eye contact,
but just me and like,

847
00:38:05,231 --> 00:38:06,820
you know,
like this camera right here,

848
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:09,730
if there's somebody standing to the left
of it,

849
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,250
you're like kind of,
you know,

850
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,173
drawn to them.
Like you want to look at two and you're 

851
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:16,060
seeing what's,
while you're acting,

852
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:18,610
if anybody that walks in the back and 
it's kind of like,

853
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:20,110
it makes your eyes jiggle a little bit.

854
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,050
It's kind of weird,
but like at the same time it's very easy

855
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,200
to your professional.
Yeah.

856
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,340
And it just ruins the illusion though.
I mean,

857
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:30,730
nobody's standing next to a camera,
like in the case of,

858
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,250
you know,
some diva that wants that kind of shit.

859
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,960
Nobody's saying next to the camera going
like this.

860
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,360
Fuck up.
Come on.

861
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:38,920
Fuck it up.
I wonder.

862
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:41,650
I'll be like looking at my eye line 
holding the camera.

863
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,680
So recently,
uh,

864
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,260
let's see,
Google's see,

865
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:51,400
oh went before Congress and one member 
of Congress,

866
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,540
a congress.
What was his name?

867
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:56,890
Larry fucking old as hell.
Is this the iphone guy?

868
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,930
What's his name?
I believe a Steve King.

869
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:03,460
Steve King Vixxo or no,
no relation.

870
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,643
He has this question for the c o one of 
the most powerful men in the world 

871
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:12,160
really come before Congress humbles 
himself before our government.

872
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,510
And this is the question that our best 
and brightest elected officials have for

873
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:17,980
the CEO of Google.

874
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,623
I have a seven year old granddaughter 
who picked up her phone before the 

875
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:24,184
election and she just playing a little 
game kinda game a kid would play and 

876
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:30,460
upon their pops a picture of her 
grandfather,

877
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:31,683
and I'm not going to say into their 
record what is the kind of language was 

878
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:36,460
used around that picture of her 
grandfather.

879
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,294
But I'd ask you,
how does that show up on a seven year 

880
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:40,990
old's iphone,
who's playing a kid's game?

881
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,880
Congressmen,
a iphone is made by a different company.

882
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:46,980
And so,
you know,

883
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,720
I mean I might've been an Android,
I was just,

884
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,580
it was a hand me down at some guidance.

885
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,970
Uh,
you know,

886
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:55,890
wait,
can I pause?

887
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,203
I have questions.
I'm happy to what's going on with this 

888
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,680
guy in the backseat,
the monopoly guy protest.

889
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,450
You can,
you can do that.

890
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:11,400
I think she's a female.
She,

891
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,060
we've seen,
I've seen her.

892
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,973
I believe it's,
if it's the same person she was at 

893
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:17,970
something else,
another hearing,

894
00:40:17,971 --> 00:40:21,900
another congressional hearing where she 
dressed up in the exact same attire,

895
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:25,050
adjusted the monocle.
It's that easy to get in there.

896
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,293
Well,
I don't know how to the public hearing 

897
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,820
come in later.
If I had to guess,

898
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,650
I would say the mustache wasn't on,
oh,

899
00:40:34,651 --> 00:40:35,940
you mean the entered?
I,

900
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,830
I disagree.
I think they pull off right now and that

901
00:40:40,831 --> 00:40:43,470
she got a prime location to it.
Like that's a good headline.

902
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:45,590
Immediately caught my eye when the guy 
was like,

903
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,183
the answer the question.
I've washed his feet of several times 

904
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,870
and now I'm just noticing this person 
up.

905
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,063
It's the guy's dribbling a basketball,
but there's a gorilla walking in the 

906
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:58,140
background.
That's one of those videos.

907
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,420
So let's continue.
We're almost more litigation,

908
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,220
which was being used,
which,

909
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,500
uh,
had a specification,

910
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,750
but I'm happy to understand it better 
and clarify it for you.

911
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,103
Okay.
That's thank you for your testimony and 

912
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,110
yield back the balance sheets that,
I'm sorry,

913
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:17,600
what is he complaining about?
A picture of,

914
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,320
uh,
of him,

915
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:21,750
I guess he said of her grandpa came up 
on her phone.

916
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,210
Now how does that happen on the iphone?
And he's like,

917
00:41:24,211 --> 00:41:26,520
well,
I'm from Google.

918
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,383
First of all,
I think we have to take into 

919
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:30,960
consideration this guy doesn't know what
the fuck he's talking.

920
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:32,060
Well yeah,
I think,

921
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,053
yeah,
but like imagine you've got this guy 

922
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,590
historically powerful person and you're 
throwing this dump.

923
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,800
Like even if it was the wrong company,
just imagine asking like,

924
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,350
why is there,
why is this picture on my phone?

925
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,750
How could that happen?
Mark people making fun of me.

926
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,360
Yeah.
Can you tell me line of all places?

927
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,233
Um,
there's a little a and there's a couple 

928
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:57,470
of flaws to his lodge.
Oh,

929
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,900
Dan.
Not ever use the Internet apparently.

930
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,381
Well,
no,

931
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:01,214
and I think that's a big problem with 
our government is that it's run by an 

932
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:05,450
old bunch of old fucks who are still 
using aol.com

933
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,700
and they're trying to fix like global 
warming and they're like,

934
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,571
hold on baby,
let me,

935
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:09,404
uh,
let me dial up real quick and check the 

936
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:17,540
science check this side.
Yay will says it's all good.

937
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,020
I got a few more free hours left 
according to this.

938
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,700
Hold on baby.
Hold on baby.

939
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:24,950
I'm waiting for my,
my cd in the mail.

940
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,110
Yeah,
I just got 30 free hours.

941
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,230
This guy in this chat room said there's 
nothing to worry about.

942
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,420
Yeah,
Dale's all he says it's all good.

943
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,153
You know,
I read something and it may be total 

944
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:37,544
bullshit,
but it makes sense that there's still 

945
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:42,380
millions of people paying aol dial up to
this day.

946
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,040
Let's break that down.
Millions of people.

947
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,970
Where are these in the states are 
gathered throughout the states.

948
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,400
Florida,
Florida is a Florida man,

949
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,260
probably Florida.
Grandma,

950
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:55,970
Florida,
grandma.

951
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,570
I would be surprised if my grandparents 
were still paying aol.com

952
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,060
dial up.
Can you imagine?

953
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:05,480
That's like,
that's amazing.

954
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,650
How,
like,

955
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,290
how would they learn though,
to upgrade to,

956
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,150
um,
not dial up,

957
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,380
you know,
to where they learn.

958
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,720
Presumably a grandson who's better than 
me,

959
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,720
but I'm justifying their,
their,

960
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,563
um,
no.

961
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,250
Yeah,
no,

962
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,650
they're,
they're faultless fusion.

963
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,603
Wow.
Confused.

964
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,523
No,
there they are faultless because they 

965
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:26,570
didn't even understand it when it came 
out back then.

966
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,730
They were old.
Now they're super old.

967
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,620
Pick that up pretty quickly.
Yeah.

968
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:31,491
So like,
you know,

969
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:32,510
we've,
we've got that,

970
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:34,160
that is our responsibility.

971
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:34,911
Like,
you know,

972
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:36,860
they're supposed to not kill the 
environment.

973
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,280
Leave us some fucking money for our 
retirement funds.

974
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:45,310
All we have to do is plug their 
computers each way so they can get their

975
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:48,230
emails.
I haven't viruses twice as fast.

976
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,083
That's true.
Well mean they shouldn't have fast 

977
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:52,724
internet.
That's a really good point because 

978
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:58,631
there's a huge problem of people preying
on old people and scheming money.

979
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,300
So I'm gonna call my grandma once and 
said,

980
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,760
um,
impersonated me.

981
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:07,220
They had all my information when I was 
in college.

982
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:09,920
It was before I was known to anybody and
they say,

983
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:10,970
hey,
it's ethan.

984
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,230
He probably didn't sound anything like 
me,

985
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:14,900
but she's old as fuck on a land line.
It says,

986
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:15,501
Hey,
it's Ethan,

987
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:18,920
I'm trapped in Mexico and I'm arrested 
and I need you to send me $5,000

988
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:19,754
bail.
And she was going to do it and my 

989
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:23,360
brother was there luckily,
and stop.

990
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,673
That's awful.
But like apparently I saw like a $2 

991
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,750
billion business,
just scamming old people.

992
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:31,703
That's so sad.
There's fake irs calls that are really 

993
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,450
getting a lot of attention these days 
and they're all from India,

994
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,510
but they will get an from the irs.
So you pay now?

995
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:40,903
Yeah.
I don't know if there was like a voice 

996
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:46,110
modulator that made them sound like they
were some like southern good old boy,

997
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,660
they would get so much more.
I,

998
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,050
why am I giving them ideas?
Shut the fuck up.

999
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,660
God Damn.
To pick up on that,

1000
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,510
they're going to start taking like 
southern jacqueline voice coaches.

1001
00:44:54,511 --> 00:44:58,700
Yes.
Southern gentlemen for Halo Dolores.

1002
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,773
And now it says here that uh,
you need to go to the irs had dot irs 

1003
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:06,460
pay right now.
That,

1004
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,440
uh,
fun.

1005
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,510
Delores,
bad news.

1006
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:14,130
There's a warrant out for your day are 
going to be in a lot of trouble.

1007
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:14,963
They're going to kick your door down and
you know the police so they will shoot 

1008
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,930
your dog.
Yeah,

1009
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,630
that's start.
That is kind of close to the,

1010
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:24,300
some of the stuff I've heard.
Oh,

1011
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:25,700
the teacher sounds great.
You've got yes.

1012
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,693
I can't wait.
Can I buy stock in that do when we were 

1013
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,153
on up by Robin Hood App,
we're going to be shiny and centers and 

1014
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,670
I'd Oh video with that character and 
devout.

1015
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,770
He found another one.
Yeah,

1016
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,460
hands on.
It gets around.

1017
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,920
Holy Shit.
140,000

1018
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:46,590
this is big news is,
well that's three days ago,

1019
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,960
so this is probably the same.
Dan,

1020
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:50,490
can you hook me up with a coke?
Zero.

1021
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,471
Sure.
Damn.

1022
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:54,870
She's got a lot of silos on her face.
You got a little [inaudible].

1023
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,830
It's like,
I don't want to hit your Sodi.

1024
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:58,651
Okay,
Sharon.

1025
00:45:58,651 --> 00:45:59,730
I look,
oh I got,

1026
00:45:59,731 --> 00:46:00,564
I'll share with Ila.
Be really cute if I'll take my old 

1027
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:03,290
Saudi.
It's Christmas.

1028
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,410
Absolutely.
That's the Christmas spirit compromise.

1029
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,223
Fuck.
I go leave it on the ground and walk 

1030
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:19,131
away for 30 minutes.
Sit.

1031
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,753
Pray.
This is a coke Marshville that 

1032
00:46:25,351 --> 00:46:28,220
refreshing Christmas season.
Thank you.

1033
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,720
All right.
Okay Robbie,

1034
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,120
let's enjoy when they click

1035
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,740
privacy policy,
you get,

1036
00:46:35,741 --> 00:46:39,260
they look at the ceiling of his or down 
is going to use

1037
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,550
this guy's like,
that's awesome.

1038
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,580
I mean this guy is just like,
I feel bad for the CEO.

1039
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,860
Oh this guy is amazing.
How does he know every,

1040
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,110
I mean I guess it's easy to know when 
the camera's on you,

1041
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,020
but like he clicks into it every time 
the camera cuts to him.

1042
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,030
He's got great timing really.
It really does.

1043
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,120
Great framing.
Right?

1044
00:46:56,121 --> 00:46:59,250
Awareness might be right.
Maybe it is a sheet so,

1045
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,113
well it's hard.
It's hard for me to tell him this video 

1046
00:47:02,741 --> 00:47:03,574
but the,
the older video from like a few months 

1047
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,120
ago,
100% cause she,

1048
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,890
cause like she gave interviews in 
character but this,

1049
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,150
this person could be a gentleman.
I offer those same thing.

1050
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,410
It's a person.
He or she with a top hat.

1051
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,410
Uh,
they're dressed as of that Amapa Lee guy

1052
00:47:17,411 --> 00:47:19,210
with the,
and they got a sack of money with them,

1053
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,860
like $20 bills popping out at the top.

1054
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,340
Very,
and they look very intrigued.

1055
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,233
Everyone else dress like super 
professional camera equipment 

1056
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:28,970
everywhere.
Yeah.

1057
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:34,010
Yeah.
Just this guy knocked on a monocle.

1058
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,850
Holy Shit.
What is the angle here?

1059
00:47:37,851 --> 00:47:41,380
Is this guy just having a laugh?
Is this a Geico commercial?

1060
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,440
The bag cause like Geico on it.
Honestly,

1061
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:46,720
if I'd thought of that first and I lived
in the area,

1062
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:47,640
I would do that.
Yeah.

1063
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,750
They're making some statement.
Um,

1064
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:52,853
not,
I mean like truthfully there being some 

1065
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:56,770
political statement about,
I don't even know what they're saying.

1066
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:58,920
One day everyone in the audience is 
going to be like,

1067
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,140
it's going to grow.
Like go be two of them.

1068
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,040
It was really out of control.
I can't write,

1069
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,540
I can't shoot without nobody's taking 
these hearings.

1070
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,353
God,
this guy's getting a lot of airtime and 

1071
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:17,170
he's loving this.
How our privacy is up for sale.

1072
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,063
I guess one of those things,
whereas we don't have this dude's like 

1073
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,390
twitter or anything.
What I'm saying?

1074
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,470
Is he sharing credit?
Can they not hold up the sign?

1075
00:48:25,471 --> 00:48:27,810
That's like following me on twitter at 
that would be a real thing.

1076
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:30,090
Not as cool.
That's just smart marketing yet.

1077
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:31,820
Actually I just found,
uh,

1078
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:35,160
they actually did an ama on reddit.
There you go.

1079
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,660
There you go.
So all your questions will be answered.

1080
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,430
Why two of them?

1081
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,650
I guess we're not that [inaudible] guys,
I'm here to take two questions.

1082
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,450
Who are you and why?
Okay.

1083
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:51,370
Thank you for coming to my ame.
Um,

1084
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,203
porn hub put together the world's most 
viewed categories of porn at 2018 by 

1085
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:01,540
geographical location.
I love it.

1086
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,550
I love it.
This says a lot.

1087
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:06,880
Now what fascinates me the most,
you'll see there's some interest.

1088
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:07,743
The U s loves lesbian,
who doesn't all south of America really 

1089
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:15,661
loves lesbian Chile,
however Thai and all over Asia,

1090
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,123
all of Asia.
I think so many people in Japan are 

1091
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:21,820
watching Hentai.
They fucked up the whole continent.

1092
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,450
Like Japan.
I get it.

1093
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,550
Russia,
I'm very surprised.

1094
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,920
It's got to be all of the eastern block.
Actually.

1095
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,840
It's like all of the former Soviet 
Union.

1096
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:33,423
That blows my mind that,
I mean I've tried Hentai just out of 

1097
00:49:36,301 --> 00:49:38,770
pure curiosity.
It's so weird.

1098
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,370
Real porn available.
Yeah.

1099
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,600
I just jerk off the captain planet.
Does that,

1100
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,520
should I move to Russia?
Good.

1101
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:57,640
The live action porn,
but cartoon girl.

1102
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,813
So I'm,
I'm shocked about Russia because 

1103
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:06,430
normally when I see these types of 
graphs and bar charts and such,

1104
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:07,870
um,
the,

1105
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:08,943
the most repressed places,
so like if if gay porn or if gay art is 

1106
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:15,844
just largely banned and frowned upon,
then usually that territory has gay 

1107
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:20,440
porn.
You know,

1108
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,071
that's like,
they're,

1109
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:23,320
they're like states in the u s it's all 
about that.

1110
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,930
Or anytime the Republican national 
convention comes to the,

1111
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,100
exactly.
So that's why I'm shocked about Russia

1112
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,880
since like,
you know,

1113
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,050
being gay is a big no,
no.

1114
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:31,880
In Russia,
they're all about the Hentai.

1115
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,040
Like if you,
if you grain new,

1116
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:36,530
if you took a closer look,
because when I've seen that where you're

1117
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:37,364
talking about like in the u s like in 
Kansas everyone's watching gay porn or 

1118
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,330
whatever.
Um,

1119
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,510
but it's so broad.
What is the green one?

1120
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,501
The green.
Well,

1121
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:49,640
so you've got Arab porn,
which is in North Africa and the one and

1122
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:52,130
then ebony and all in Africa,
which is black.

1123
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,400
I find that interesting that people,
they're trying,

1124
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,660
they want to get down with their own 
shit.

1125
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:00,170
And then South as South East Asia you've
got Asian.

1126
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,570
Can I just say my favorite is big Dick.

1127
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:09,590
It's Pakistan,
right?

1128
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,060
And an end in India.
Their favorite like mills,

1129
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,760
the mills man,
the weirdest ones.

1130
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,210
Look at Spain.
Spain stands alone.

1131
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,390
What is it?
Oh there's a lot of uh,

1132
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,500
anal.
Sure.

1133
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:32,000
Oh that's different than a stop mill.
Beyond that,

1134
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,570
beyond pile the cougar champs.
Beyond mill.

1135
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,433
Like old as fuck.
Cause I was going to say basically are 

1136
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:44,201
technically all porn is mature,
but if it's an early audience is weird.

1137
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,590
Really.
All those people I would guess like,

1138
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:52,620
it's like Kyle Milf I would say is like 
30 to 50 mature is like 60 plot.

1139
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,570
Like paint.
Like damn.

1140
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,540
I did all about it from Spain 
apparently.

1141
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:04,060
How does the whole country perhaps 
further analyze,

1142
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,200
oh wait,
what's that?

1143
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:08,500
To the east?
Yeah.

1144
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,820
I honestly don't know.
For instance to the east.

1145
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,190
Yeah,
that one was that.

1146
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,313
Oh,
oh,

1147
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,570
oh,
that's gotta be like the Romania.

1148
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,670
I will get us from a fucking idiot.

1149
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,120
Germany.
Germany's into anal England is into anal

1150
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,280
what was right again?
No,

1151
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,340
that is lesbian.
This is Germany.

1152
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:32,570
No,
Germany.

1153
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:34,190
But what you pointed to was not,
anyway.

1154
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,940
Oh fuck me.
Here it is.

1155
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,110
Tomorrow's vote.
What is this?

1156
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:41,540
Norway.
Youtube for our shit.

1157
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,590
That's actually Sweden,
Norway,

1158
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,320
Finland,
all the same place.

1159
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,680
I got that one right.
You get eaten alive for that.

1160
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:55,040
Can I say Europeans make fun of 
Americans for being like so stupid.

1161
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,010
You try to name five states from the 
United States.

1162
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:59,540
I don't live in here.
I don't give a shit.

1163
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:04,340
I'm used to just label them like normal.
Yeah.

1164
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:07,650
Give us a break here.
I'm,

1165
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:11,390
I'm surprised that lesbian porn is so 
predominant.

1166
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,560
Yeah,
like everywhere across the sea.

1167
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:16,670
The normal.
We're all friends here.

1168
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,504
Apparently.
You just like a Western civilization 

1169
00:53:18,771 --> 00:53:20,050
thing.
Yeah.

1170
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,240
Have I value on lesbians?
I really,

1171
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,610
this is big for gay acceptance.

1172
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,320
That's not progress.
I don't want to know what he are.

1173
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,890
ICKY.
But lesbians sounded,

1174
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,650
I know don't match that.
I thought we lived in lesbian.

1175
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,540
Is that lesbian?
I thought that was,

1176
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,433
I thought I thought this was a map with 
names of the places and that is the 

1177
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,240
country.
Yeah,

1178
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,080
that was the bit,
that was good.

1179
00:53:46,081 --> 00:53:48,450
It was all a bit,
the big,

1180
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:53,451
big country is the best anymore.
Dan,

1181
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,710
can you help me clarify?
So who's in a big deck?

1182
00:53:55,711 --> 00:53:58,400
Pakistanian who are these guys?
I think that's Nepal.

1183
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,680
Both have little dicks.
Uh,

1184
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:04,420
do you have data on that?

1185
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,123
I think the thing,
I think why lesbian porn is so popular 

1186
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:14,700
is because men and women,
I think,

1187
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:19,710
sure it's crowd pleasing because dudes 
are like,

1188
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:20,431
hey,
that's hot.

1189
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:21,870
And then of course girls will like,
I was like,

1190
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:23,870
I don't want to see dudes.
Honestly.

1191
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,500
No,
that's true.

1192
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,333
Yeah.
We learned earlier that women don't 

1193
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:30,590
enjoy sex.
So do you know that,

1194
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,700
I find that interesting that people in 
Africa are watching Ebony and then North

1195
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,960
Africa Arab world.
I know there are Arab,

1196
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:38,620
but I just think,
you know,

1197
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,980
you want to see your own content,
your own peeps.

1198
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,880
You want to relate to,
people will say that Hi Eric,

1199
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,001
that out.
Oh,

1200
00:54:48,001 --> 00:54:49,440
it's great.
But okay.

1201
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:52,980
So I think,
but what is the appeal?

1202
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:55,410
Um,
Zachary in our band.

1203
00:54:55,411 --> 00:54:58,110
Do any of you guys watch Hentai?
No,

1204
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:01,020
I'm like you ethan.
Like I checked it out out of curiosity,

1205
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:02,160
but I don't,
I don't find it.

1206
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,400
I don't find that arousing man.
It's got be,

1207
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,330
yes.
Yeah.

1208
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:11,940
Well Ian is always the odd one out and I
appreciate his honesty.

1209
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,860
So,
and tell me what your tire you into to.

1210
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,770
That's a negative for me and I'm 
offended personally.

1211
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:19,120
Never heard of that animal.
Exactly.

1212
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,580
Come on,
be level with us.

1213
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:22,330
Nah,
I'm in the mills.

1214
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,180
Are you really?
Wait,

1215
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:26,400
are you really?
And so what,

1216
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:29,600
do you know why you prefer older women 
or is that just a preface?

1217
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,930
You know,
I don't know.

1218
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,580
I don't know.
You know,

1219
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,570
therapist could help you unpack that 
word.

1220
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:38,423
The Mill Fsa.
Well you would fit in in India 

1221
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:44,210
apparently.
And we have got to stop.

1222
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,280
Hold on that,
that's India.

1223
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:55,060
Any places name with [inaudible] and 
then also we've got a,

1224
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:58,680
what do we got here,
Dan?

1225
00:55:58,681 --> 00:55:59,750
Is that?
Oh,

1226
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,740
that would be polar said.
If a country existed at World War II,

1227
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,450
I know what it is because of all the 
video games are played.

1228
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,230
All of my geography comes from hearts of
iron.

1229
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,330
Now will you painting now,
Dan and Ian,

1230
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:13,164
will you,
what kind of porn category do you guys 

1231
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:15,590
watch?
While I was going to say,

1232
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,850
you know it's interesting,
there's a whole milk thing.

1233
00:56:17,851 --> 00:56:22,500
It was sort of an eye opening thing when
I realized that I'm old enough that MILF

1234
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:25,830
porn is just for women my age.
Yeah.

1235
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,210
That was kind of like a,
that was the oh shit moment right there.

1236
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,020
Oh,
that's real.

1237
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,150
Let's see what real.
So are you saying that that the ones who

1238
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:33,030
never moved out of their homes,
I can ask funny.

1239
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,740
Yeah,
I know I don't have to go.

1240
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:37,330
I didn't agree with that.
When I look at MILF porn,

1241
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:40,120
I see like old days with fake titties.
You said it earlier.

1242
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:41,650
I mean it kind of runs a range,
but it,

1243
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:46,750
it does seem to mill is almost like late
twenties to forties and 50s.

1244
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,450
When you go to a porn site,
do you type MILF?

1245
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,380
Are you kind of just rolling?
No,

1246
00:56:54,381 --> 00:56:55,214
no,
no.

1247
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,500
Can we,
can we consciously seeking it out?

1248
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,453
Anal?
I feel like we're not giving anal its 

1249
00:56:59,871 --> 00:57:02,280
fair share of the spotlight,
but,

1250
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,163
but the whole country's do a parent,
I was expecting to see more anal in the 

1251
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:08,480
chart.
I saw somebody point out that the,

1252
00:57:08,481 --> 00:57:10,310
uh,
in the Mideast there,

1253
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,050
um,
the anal block,

1254
00:57:12,051 --> 00:57:16,040
if you will,
no block block is the exact,

1255
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,770
a territory of the old Persian empire 
for some reason.

1256
00:57:18,771 --> 00:57:21,380
So there's gotta be some correlation 
there.

1257
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:24,230
History buffs,
please hook us up.

1258
00:57:24,231 --> 00:57:26,030
Please help us out.
Is that in Germany?

1259
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:26,973
I would see,
um,

1260
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,160
well that's funny because all over 
Iceland apparently.

1261
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,930
Oh yeah.
Iceland is just anal.

1262
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:35,690
Is Italy.
Milfs yes.

1263
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:37,250
Oh yeah,
look at that.

1264
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:42,490
That's a surprise.
You see it.

1265
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:45,383
So then there's that.
And then there's also a lot of weird 

1266
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:52,671
stuff like that you can't do with real 
people like tentacle rec rape.

1267
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:56,040
And it's just I,
it's just so bizarre.

1268
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:57,263
But I think a lot of it's got to be 
hardwired from kids watching cause 

1269
00:57:59,431 --> 00:58:03,150
there's some bomb ass cartoon characters
like Kyla kill

1270
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:04,443
the enemy killed walking like that,
straight up Hentai and those girls are 

1271
00:58:07,601 --> 00:58:09,730
fucking slamming dude.
Well that's it.

1272
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,280
But I never watched antimony kids adult 
only as an adult I've seen that shit.

1273
00:58:17,111 --> 00:58:19,930
But if I watched that as a kid I 
would've been like Dick out all day.

1274
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,630
That would awards my fucking mind.
You know what I mean?

1275
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,890
And that would have like rearranged all 
my sexual desire like an early,

1276
00:58:26,891 --> 00:58:28,830
if you introduced that shit at an early 
age,

1277
00:58:28,831 --> 00:58:29,664
cause like a lot of anime as you said,
it's hypersexualized in one way or 

1278
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:33,670
another.
When we were growing up,

1279
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:36,790
we had misty from pokemon.
That's it.

1280
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,440
I'll give you that,
I'll give you that.

1281
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:40,143
Or April from April,
April and like hurdles but some cartoon 

1282
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:48,820
characters,
the way they draw them with like black,

1283
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:54,140
I'm like daddy's everywhere and nowhere 
and then like,

1284
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,500
and then the camera's always from the 
back.

1285
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:57,334
You're looking at Lek,
her badge and I'll bump stops and it's 

1286
00:59:00,221 --> 00:59:04,520
too sexy.
Which color?

1287
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,930
I think they're hardwired that way.
Option on there talking.

1288
00:59:07,931 --> 00:59:08,710
No,
I'm looking for,

1289
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,480
I'm looking for furry.
Furry.

1290
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:15,760
Is that a porn category?
Hell yeah.

1291
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,790
He's here about life.
I guess so.

1292
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,350
You're right.
You guys have a porn preference?

1293
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,913
Um,

1294
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:23,323
I type in porn and then I have like 
everything available and then depending 

1295
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:32,030
on my mood,
my drunkenness level,

1296
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,830
uh,
I just go,

1297
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:37,100
yeah,
that one and see what looks good.

1298
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:37,993
What do you usually,
then I go back to reading the Wall 

1299
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:41,600
Street Journal.
That's what I come,

1300
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,130
you know,
go ahead Jack.

1301
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,540
I asked the bus.
Uh,

1302
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,460
no.
Um,

1303
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,760
you know,
there's a whole trope,

1304
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,350
um,
embarrassed,

1305
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:55,184
nude female.
Enf that's like a whole site on reddit 

1306
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,120
where it's like,
yeah,

1307
00:59:59,121 --> 00:59:59,571
yes,
yes,

1308
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:00,540
yes.
There's a subreddit.

1309
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,940
What is it called?
Embarrassed,

1310
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,480
happy and bay.
It's,

1311
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,470
I don't know the sub Reddit,
I don't know that one.

1312
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:11,830
But there are so unpack,
unpack that.

1313
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:13,820
There's nothing to back,
it's just,

1314
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:15,360
it's,
it's just like,

1315
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:20,600
like a bullet bourbon.
No.

1316
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,090
It's just like God help you through 
this.

1317
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:23,720
And Yeah.
Thank,

1318
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,780
you know,
embarrassed,

1319
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,760
new,
famous females.

1320
01:00:25,761 --> 01:00:27,070
This is exactly what it sounds like.

1321
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:29,990
It's like a whole some cute,
it's a whole genre.

1322
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:31,190
It's like,
oops.

1323
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:32,270
You know,
like that kind of shit.

1324
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:33,620
Oh No.
Yeah.

1325
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,463
Like,
because as a young kid you saw the 

1326
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,340
Marilyn Manson,
Marilyn Manson.

1327
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:40,890
Oh yeah.
He certainly got really twisted.

1328
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,970
Shall lie.
That's,

1329
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:43,790
that's,
you know,

1330
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:47,410
Marilyn Monroe tow this car like a pinup
trope.

1331
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:48,710
Right.
I'm being embarrassed.

1332
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,790
Look old.
Pinups a pinup girl.

1333
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:54,740
The whole embarrassing,
right?

1334
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,820
Yeah.
That's a big part of it.

1335
01:00:55,821 --> 01:00:57,500
I'm sure you know.
Very retro.

1336
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:58,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

1337
01:00:58,610 --> 01:00:59,840
So I'm an old school.
He's old school.

1338
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:00,840
Yeah,
absolutely.

1339
01:01:00,841 --> 01:01:02,480
They are MILF snow.
Well,

1340
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:02,990
no,
they're,

1341
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:03,620
no,
they're dead.

1342
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,650
They're gum mills.
That's a,

1343
01:01:05,651 --> 01:01:08,380
uh,
that's a corpse.

1344
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,670
I was like the fuck am I all right.

1345
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,090
Kill,
kill,

1346
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,390
kill for that.
Like,

1347
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,980
I'd like to kill a few baby.
Yeah.

1348
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,890
See I,
I'll have,

1349
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,050
yeah,
whatever the Corp side.

1350
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:20,953
All right.
Well,

1351
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,220
there you have it.
Oh,

1352
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,560
this was a fun little,
um,

1353
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,180
little excursion,
wasn't it?

1354
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,320
Fun Rabbit hole to dive into.
People like kid,

1355
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:30,710
I fucking,
I fucking jerk off.

1356
01:01:30,711 --> 01:01:31,610
Did you?
Yeah.

1357
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:32,444
I don't want to hurt anybody.
It's just what Taneesha d and You guys 

1358
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:36,300
talked about like,
just like not that different,

1359
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,490
I think furry stuff.
Oh,

1360
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,090
that's interesting.
Yeah,

1361
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:42,240
because I,
yeah,

1362
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:45,170
I find the furry thing,
it's just strange and wild too,

1363
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,540
because apparently they have a flop for 
the deck.

1364
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,780
We made it up doing no,
I think that's real.

1365
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,500
Yeah.
Oh,

1366
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,520
we didn't make that up.
You guys didn't see all of the correct,

1367
01:01:55,521 --> 01:01:58,130
the record emails that I received last 
week.

1368
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,450
Furries are pissed.
Yeah.

1369
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,040
Not even Piss,
but they're like,

1370
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,680
there's a lot more to it.
I see.

1371
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,593
I will have to know that we do it.
They don't share their reduced to being 

1372
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,130
year first and then they're like,
that's not it.

1373
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,560
There's much more than you thing.
Blah,

1374
01:02:09,561 --> 01:02:10,394
blah,
blah.

1375
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,250
Oh,
I'm so glad you asked that you left.

1376
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:14,223
Uh,
no,

1377
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:15,443
that's,
that's your thing is why am I the 

1378
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:20,140
fucking authority?
I'm just shit you effing

1379
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:20,993
is.
Um,

1380
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,610
when furry stop sacks,
you keep saying say that,

1381
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:25,920
but you don't,
don't worry.

1382
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:26,754
I got you.
The first thing is when parties have 

1383
01:02:29,671 --> 01:02:31,950
sex,
you know it's all a lot of people in the

1384
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:35,030
costume.
The costume I think,

1385
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:35,923
I think it's called sex.
I think I knew about gifting before I 

1386
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:44,571
knew it was like this is more out of the
costume you things in what's the point?

1387
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:49,823
Flap out ride or die baby cause they 
ain't got a flap on their constant 

1388
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:56,610
because they're not like a joint.
Yeah.

1389
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,020
How often do they fuck take a mouse hole
for your Dick?

1390
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,750
I absolutely got it.
Maybe the gift

1391
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:07,830
part of the,
the the role play,

1392
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:12,860
you know for sure or sexual like that.
Cause like I have a number of viewers,

1393
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:16,690
a number of my,
my,

1394
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,583
my viewers are in fact for you and you 
can tell by [inaudible] on twitter and 

1395
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:21,510
if,
you know,

1396
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:25,430
if it's an Avatar cars to ethan based on
the email and I don't,

1397
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,870
I don't doubt it.
I don't discriminate.

1398
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:31,530
I take everybody views desperately just 
guys watch the game or awards at all.

1399
01:03:31,531 --> 01:03:32,364
Like a few days ago go.
I think the guy who won Gamer of the 

1400
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,060
year,
it showed up in a costume.

1401
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:41,820
He was a furry and he came out and just 
very costume and he accepted it.

1402
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:45,480
And how is being a furry con like how in
the 90s people were like,

1403
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:47,910
it's okay to be gay.
Are we taking it that far?

1404
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:49,080
I don't think so.
I don't think it's that,

1405
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:52,660
are they looking for acceptance or 
they'll looking for recognition but,

1406
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,800
but why is it that serious don't take 
themselves that seriously?

1407
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:57,270
Well Dan,
you've got emails.

1408
01:03:57,271 --> 01:03:58,910
Where are they serious or not?
They weren't,

1409
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,020
honestly,
they weren't really that mad.

1410
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,100
It was more just like,
hey,

1411
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:04,050
just want to let you know it's not 
always a sexual thing,

1412
01:04:04,051 --> 01:04:05,150
blah blah blah.
So like,

1413
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:05,993
you know,
they were just sort of expanding on it 

1414
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:08,963
as far as like my viewers,
like you know when I get tweets and 

1415
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:13,830
stuff from people you can see by their 
profile picture that like,

1416
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:15,270
you know,
it's them in a furry thing.

1417
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:15,610
Yes.

1418
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:17,710
And I,
I've never met a mean one yet,

1419
01:04:17,711 --> 01:04:19,890
so I'm,
I'm prone to like them.

1420
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:22,720
They are very great community.
It's cool though,

1421
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:24,043
dammit.
Why you guys being all nice and I look 

1422
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:28,790
like a cynical asshole.
You know,

1423
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,433
I have a whole list of hateful things.
I always look like the asshole one 

1424
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:42,550
fucking time indigenous peoples today.

1425
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,133
Um,
but I did ask this question when 

1426
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:50,210
tenacious d was here,
if they are,

1427
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,900
they're really into the role playing so 
they must paint their dick red.

1428
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,150
I'm sorry.
Who's the worries?

1429
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,620
Cause we like a dog bone or like dog 
boner.

1430
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,930
Like it goes red,
the red rocket kind of thing.

1431
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,760
Because if you just pay it,
take out a human dick,

1432
01:05:04,761 --> 01:05:05,950
that ain't right.
I don't think so.

1433
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:08,570
I don't think that's,
that's a a very amusing thought.

1434
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,060
Trust me.
Just,

1435
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:11,900
I don't think they'd take it to that 
level.

1436
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:14,560
What would have,
correct me if I'm wrong for who?

1437
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,413
Yeah.
But I don't think they go that like 

1438
01:05:17,951 --> 01:05:18,400
that's,

1439
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,001
that's pretty,
uh,

1440
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:21,850
that's a method like that.
Some Daniel Day Lewis Shit right there.

1441
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:22,773
That's some real Marlon Brando Shit.
What about animals with really strange 

1442
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:27,470
penis?
Little ducks.

1443
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:29,751
Ducks?
Yeah.

1444
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:31,990
Yeah.
So they probably mutilate their penis.

1445
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:36,310
You just need a little spirit gum.
And a big,

1446
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:37,144
uh,
you know,

1447
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:41,770
they sounds prop.
We need a furry,

1448
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,820
plenty of shops,
you know,

1449
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:48,120
watch the firies in la tech art email,
Dan podcast.

1450
01:05:48,121 --> 01:05:49,390
Say Shoes.
You productions.com.

1451
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:50,403
Let's get a furry here in costume.
I've got 'em hundred and one questions 

1452
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,100
where you could do half in and half out.
Go.

1453
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,630
Also,
I love my preference also or I want,

1454
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:06,720
I want one who was also acquainted with 
the sexual aspect because I do want to,

1455
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:07,953
I want that.
I want to know if they paint their Dick 

1456
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:10,770
reade.
You should have one nonsexual furry.

1457
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:13,330
Just does it for the cause playing and 
then one who like,

1458
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:16,630
dude,
that's the future of this podcast.

1459
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,400
You look at Joe Rogan.
Oh,

1460
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,950
let me get a scientists on about sleep.
No,

1461
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,460
for,
what the fuck are you?

1462
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,181
Hey,
you're welcome.

1463
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:27,030
By the way,
up to the,

1464
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:29,230
the furry train.
Well I know I'm not caught up,

1465
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:30,064
but I just,
I never thought of actually getting one 

1466
01:06:31,511 --> 01:06:33,570
in here.
I've already had a like a,

1467
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,653
an arc.
You was my life on the Internet where 

1468
01:06:36,131 --> 01:06:37,840
like when I first learned about furries,
I was like,

1469
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:39,250
that's weird.
I hate it.

1470
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:41,740
And then it evolved into like,
oh,

1471
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:43,540
there's just nothing wrong with these 
fucking people at all.

1472
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:45,280
Right.
Have you had a good time,

1473
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:48,730
a comment,
etiquette video on furries?

1474
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:49,683
I don't think so.
People have given them such a hard time 

1475
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:54,820
on the Internet.
Like I feel like it'd be targeted.

1476
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:57,220
I don't want to be lumped in with the 
demeanor side.

1477
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,110
I hear that's a guy.

1478
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:00,743
No,
I agree.

1479
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,310
I think they'd have it honestly though 
in my experience,

1480
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:04,750
they have a very good sense of humor 
about it.

1481
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:05,613
If you did it tastefully,
do you do do stuff tastefully comedic 

1482
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:09,860
wise I think.
No,

1483
01:07:09,861 --> 01:07:11,350
no you didn't.
You I think,

1484
01:07:11,351 --> 01:07:12,184
I think you could get away with it 
honestly and it'd be very funny and 

1485
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:14,910
they're like,
yeah,

1486
01:07:14,911 --> 01:07:16,870
if I did well,
I'm just perplexed.

1487
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,000
I would never be able to beef for views.
I just,

1488
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:24,060
I just am.
And their costumes are so weird.

1489
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:26,710
Like,
like the familiar face.

1490
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:28,120
It's just,
it's strange.

1491
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:29,500
What's weird about it,
Ethan?

1492
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:33,880
Well,
they all look like a fucking acid trip.

1493
01:07:33,881 --> 01:07:35,650
Like humanoid.
Fuck.

1494
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,270
Like it's just weird.
I don't know.

1495
01:07:37,271 --> 01:07:38,530
Let's get it.
Let's move on.

1496
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:39,833
We're like an hour a furry.
If there was like an outside group 

1497
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:45,240
called the scally's alien.
Yeah,

1498
01:07:45,241 --> 01:07:47,710
they were all reptilians don't need that
conspiracy theory.

1499
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,003
I have to have for,
but then do they put the scales a 

1500
01:07:52,471 --> 01:07:53,660
little?
Uh,

1501
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:54,913
no.
I would just be like all covered in 

1502
01:07:55,631 --> 01:07:58,150
turtle shell.
I like it.

1503
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,290
I like it.
Like Thai.

1504
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:01,660
They do seem like they have a creepy 
face.

1505
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,370
Do you guys all say that's what I'm 
saying?

1506
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:04,204
There's a creepy fails.
This next video that's a little black 

1507
01:08:09,191 --> 01:08:10,024
man.
That's something that that of a person 

1508
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:16,040
wearing

1509
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,340
that this is some strange outset of 
furries.

1510
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:19,373
They did perspective.
That dude who's recording this video 

1511
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:24,800
calls him little homie.
So he's a little homey.

1512
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:28,400
I think that's how they prefer it to be 
like we men kind of thing.

1513
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,530
He just says a little homemade.
He doesn't know him.

1514
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:31,760
Oh,
okay.

1515
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,850
One thing at a time.
So we're looking at furry.

1516
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:40,790
The faces is creeps me out.
And I'm sorry if that offends you.

1517
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:45,230
I just divides into the group of people 
that has creeped out by it.

1518
01:08:45,231 --> 01:08:46,960
His face.
Oh,

1519
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:49,130
I didn't mean to click well there you 
have it anyway.

1520
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:50,360
Right.
But look at that.

1521
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:53,450
All hotel guests should behave like 
these furries.

1522
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:58,480
Furries are like pinnacle politeness or 
you look at your chest man,

1523
01:08:58,851 --> 01:09:00,760
you've got a furry your that's your 
Caribbean.

1524
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,230
I sure am defending them a lot.
I guess it makes you wonder.

1525
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,650
It makes you wonder.
No,

1526
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:08,030
I personally am not.
But like,

1527
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,980
it's just,
oh,

1528
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:14,990
but do you guys find their faith creepy?
I don't find the face cream if I'm being

1529
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:16,980
honest.
I mean I,

1530
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,620
I'll say this,
I don't get it.

1531
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:20,900
I don't get the appeal.
I do not,

1532
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,690
I don't find them creepy.
Wow.

1533
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:26,960
I don't find him creepy.
And I like,

1534
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,180
I don't want to like,
I don't want to make fun of them cause I

1535
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:30,014
feel,
I feel like a whole community and it's 

1536
01:09:33,051 --> 01:09:36,500
just like I got none of them.
Likewise.

1537
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,530
What's there to get mad at?
Beautifully put.

1538
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,600
Beautifully.
I'm pissed.

1539
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,580
Oh No.
Oh No.

1540
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:49,563
And all of this dancing.
My eyeline right now that need to be in 

1541
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:58,811
my line.
They didn't see the furries or anything.

1542
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:02,680
Oh No.
Well,

1543
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:07,220
we'll talk about what they were 
anthropomorphic.

1544
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:08,930
Alright,
we're trouble shooting.

1545
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,250
Like what?
What else do you need to know?

1546
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:13,010
Foxes and dogs and whatnot.
Like you've seen furries.

1547
01:10:13,011 --> 01:10:14,210
You know what it looks like.
You got it.

1548
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,940
You know what if that was like the only 
way I could get off,

1549
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:18,770
I mean,
I guess it's not a sex thing,

1550
01:10:18,771 --> 01:10:20,360
but if that was the only way I could get
off,

1551
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,730
I would be the best for you in the 
world.

1552
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,340
I would have the dopest shit I would 
like.

1553
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,500
What's your first SONA?
Jack,

1554
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:33,550
you're a fucking first be a rabbit.
If fucking rabbit implants put into my,

1555
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,980
uh,
into my legs so I could hop like one,

1556
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:47,450
like hydraulics and stuff.
If I wasn't liking the action around me,

1557
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,293
I would just leap out of that way.
Great icebreaker and also great 

1558
01:10:52,011 --> 01:10:52,844
conversation ender.
And it's how the end of the night just 

1559
01:10:55,281 --> 01:11:00,281
leaped into the ceiling above my bed.
I don't have to watch Netflix,

1560
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:05,980
go to bed and turnin knock yourself out.
We called concussion and ready if,

1561
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,960
I don't know why,
but um,

1562
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,373
you split that,
that clip up into multiple smaller 

1563
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:28,420
clips.
I'll tell you when you're watching.

1564
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:33,800
People are so tired of hearing that the 
cable,

1565
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:37,520
I can't pull that up here.
I've gotten to watch red letter media at

1566
01:11:37,521 --> 01:11:40,080
all.
Their latest video is a god.

1567
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:42,840
What was it about what they do?
It's as if I,

1568
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:43,773
if you know that,
and you know that they do a series 

1569
01:11:44,461 --> 01:11:48,780
called best of the worst where they just
reviewed terrible forgotten vhs films of

1570
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:49,614
the eighties and nineties.
So I'll spoil the surprise cause it 

1571
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:54,900
happened so quickly.
Um,

1572
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:56,160
everything's going fine.
You know,

1573
01:11:56,161 --> 01:11:56,994
they do like the little plink Kedo or 
Plinko thing of like selecting the 

1574
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:00,691
movies.
They,

1575
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,450
the drop a ball and the whole grid and 
like lands on a vhs tape.

1576
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,583
Sometimes it lands on player's choice,
which means that they can choose 

1577
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:09,960
whatever video they want.
So Atlanta and player's choice out walks

1578
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:12,700
in fucking macaulay culkin.
We're back.

1579
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,680
Any holds up a copy of home alone for,
and he's like,

1580
01:12:16,681 --> 01:12:18,380
we're watching this guy.
Wow.

1581
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:19,283
And they,
so they actually watch home alone for 

1582
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:23,363
Macaulay Culkin and they're all making 
jokes at everyone's extent and it's so 

1583
01:12:28,441 --> 01:12:30,240
damn funny and it's so like wholesome.

1584
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:32,250
Oh,
how cool is that?

1585
01:12:32,251 --> 01:12:35,230
I got the Culkin they got,
they got Kevin mcallister,

1586
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,310
I think that's his name,
right.

1587
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:37,144
And I'm like,
well does he live fucking know what I 

1588
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:40,300
mean?
No,

1589
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,160
he's Macaulay Culkin,
but the animal alone.

1590
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,053
Oh,
he's Kevin,

1591
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:43,841
right?
He's Kevin.

1592
01:12:43,841 --> 01:12:48,841
He's a little like random when la their 
videos.

1593
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:50,351
Yes.
Yeah.

1594
01:12:50,351 --> 01:12:51,184
And I think,
I think he's a big fan of red letter 

1595
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:55,270
media and red letter media is strangely 
like,

1596
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,021
okay.
They're like,

1597
01:12:56,021 --> 01:12:57,940
yeah,
I think everyone's secretly a big fan of

1598
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:01,110
it's on youtube.
Why?

1599
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:01,953
Secretly?
Because their channels rela I mean this 

1600
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:07,330
is not small but relatively smaller than
how well known they are.

1601
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,660
Genius.
And they have like that and shit.

1602
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:14,630
The word,
they have their own equity.

1603
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,150
Yes they do.
They have,

1604
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,513
they have less than 900,000
subscribers are going to get to a 

1605
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,453
million by the end of the year.
Like if someone pushes for them because 

1606
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:24,754
they deserve 10 minute Shum Dick Jokes 
next to my bed head more subscribers 

1607
01:13:29,051 --> 01:13:29,320
than them.

1608
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,580
And I was like this,
just like,

1609
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,190
it's not fair.
This is a government plot to be fair.

1610
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:36,460
I love your Dick Jokes,
but like red letter media even more.

1611
01:13:36,461 --> 01:13:37,294
I know they should have better media 
tube and you want to watch it because 

1612
01:13:42,191 --> 01:13:45,700
they're not like the way I viewed them.
They're not even a youtube channel.

1613
01:13:45,701 --> 01:13:46,534
I feel like they ascended beyond a 
youtube channel because they don't do 

1614
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:49,990
the whole like,
hey,

1615
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:52,900
what's everybody was going on in today?
Like they just go in there like,

1616
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,120
well Mike Walter,
hey washing.

1617
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:58,150
I'm apathy.
They're very classy.

1618
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,950
But what's so funny?
So,

1619
01:13:59,951 --> 01:14:01,020
so dry.
Funny.

1620
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:03,700
We're the fuck did they get their 
warehouse is what I want to know.

1621
01:14:03,701 --> 01:14:04,534
Red Letter media.
Where did you get this God damn 

1622
01:14:06,431 --> 01:14:11,050
warehouse and I'll move there.
If this is holly all the time.

1623
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,120
What I wonder is if our,

1624
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,170
are they furries?
Oh,

1625
01:14:14,171 --> 01:14:15,004
you know they are rich Evans might be 
like a hedgehog or I believe I fucking 

1626
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:23,850
love this is a sonic the hedgehog.
Right.

1627
01:14:23,851 --> 01:14:27,370
So this video,
um,

1628
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:31,180
I assume that this little homeys on some
kind of drug.

1629
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,680
Hmm.
Cause he seems high on [inaudible].

1630
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,220
He seems high energy.
Okay.

1631
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,310
But I'll let you guys enjoy is the high 
end good vibes.

1632
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:40,810
Good vibes.

01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:41,740
Only.
Yeah.

1634
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,073
He's not associated.
He's not associated with the guy who 

1635
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:45,400
hooked to their mark.
By the way.

1636
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:48,760
I will say he's free.
He's dressed fresh as hell for having to

1637
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:49,930
shop like kids.
Shit.

1638
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:54,890
Like that's a pretty fresh outfit.
He's got the Jordans on Jordan beanies,

1639
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,080
got sloppy.
Knows what's up.

1640
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:57,490
Yeah.
He looks good but not as,

1641
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,360
he's not having a good day.
I got no audio.

1642
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,200
Nope.
Oh Ma.

1643
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:02,831
I got it.
It's okay.

1644
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:03,820
I can,
I can read lips.

1645
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:06,640
Yeah,
no idea what he's saying.

1646
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,880
Why furries forever furries together.
Do you get that pre son?

1647
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,313
Okay,
here we go.

1648
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:16,413
Here we go.

1649
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:19,330
I see.
Gotcha.

1650
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:20,783
Trying to rob,
but he doesn't have a weapon or oh 

1651
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:25,910
that's not going to work.
You need a weapon piece,

1652
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,220
throwing gummy treats at the cashier.
He's trying to steal.

1653
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:33,940
He's St fill that bag up.
I don't even see the bag.

1654
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,320
You already gave it to him.
I go,

1655
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,300
oh,
that's filled that bag up.

1656
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,433
Honestly,
I got to let them all at one point 

1657
01:15:44,381 --> 01:15:49,381
you'll hear they offer 50 to go away.
Take this.

1658
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:02,643
You go left back.
I just gathered around of course only 

1659
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:26,580
throwing gummy treats like what does 
that go?

1660
01:16:26,621 --> 01:16:27,454
That bad guy.
This is the most gangster shit I ever 

1661
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:35,800
seen him drink and what these people are
amazing.

1662
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:41,210
The police coming,
the police coming home avenue here.

1663
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,710
This is the alternate ending.

1664
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:53,510
They actually,
Oh yeah,

1665
01:16:53,551 --> 01:16:54,384
I get it.
How you're going to say it took me a 

1666
01:16:57,541 --> 01:16:58,374
second.

1667
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,810
I was going to make a bunch of nerdy.

1668
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:09,540
I was going to say this is an alternate.
I'm kingdom hearts three and

1669
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:12,283
coming in January.
I would love to have for him to be a 

1670
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:17,270
playable character.
Why?

1671
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:19,770
He has a whole arc and everything.
Okay.

1672
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:21,420
No,
that bag up homie.

1673
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,560
Perfectly.
His weapon.

1674
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:33,561
It's gummy gummy.
Holly's coming.

1675
01:17:35,521 --> 01:17:40,521
Come on dude.
He's a convenience store.

1676
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:04,370
It gets cluttered.
The bleeds job take down of all time.

1677
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,480
I love how the police are just like,
all right,

1678
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:20,323
little.
That'd be like if shawshank redemption 

1679
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:24,643
had a bad ending,
we got her with Washington's going to 

1680
01:18:27,331 --> 01:18:28,330
get away with it.

1681
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:43,380
Thank ain't no.
I think

1682
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:46,860
ultimately this is a tragic video 
because this is a guy,

1683
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:47,903
the soul of a gangster and the body of a
child and even those recording him who 

1684
01:18:52,021 --> 01:18:52,854
are trying to root them on a help and 
can't help but laugh as he's Gentili 

1685
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,370
laid down by the police.
A little slap sticky.

1686
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:02,520
It literally is like some physical 
comedy.

1687
01:19:02,521 --> 01:19:06,510
Slapstick was,
I think he was on something.

1688
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,270
He didn't choke half a beer and then,
but he matched,

1689
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:13,890
obliterated on the ground.
That was amazing.

1690
01:19:13,891 --> 01:19:14,724
That's got to be just finishing though.
Like if I worked for the mortal Kombat 

1691
01:19:20,431 --> 01:19:21,264
game,
I'd be getting in touch with this guy's 

1692
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:25,320
people growing wine bottle only bear 
smash brothers.

1693
01:19:25,321 --> 01:19:28,880
Ultimate has dlc coming out.
Just some food for [inaudible].

1694
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:35,370
Right.
By the way,

1695
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:40,010
that games freaking awesome.
Yeah.

1696
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,710
It's all I want.
That's all I want to be doing.

1697
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,160
Disgusting.
Sexist brain.

1698
01:19:44,161 --> 01:19:48,450
Didn't label you don't play any games,
but I like this one.

1699
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:49,343
It's fun.
Don't get yourself a switch by plea 

1700
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,290
played smash brothers was in college.
Yeah,

1701
01:19:58,291 --> 01:20:00,720
me too.
Game Cube.

1702
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:01,673
I wasn't the,
I walk into a room and it was like the 

1703
01:20:04,051 --> 01:20:06,660
liveliest thing I've ever seen and I was
like,

1704
01:20:06,661 --> 01:20:07,170
God,
I,

1705
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,100
I was good at this

1706
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:10,003
one while I used to be real good,
but now I suck at Mineola on the same 

1707
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:13,434
level,
which is fun.

1708
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:16,280
But the single player is like amazing.
It's usually,

1709
01:20:16,281 --> 01:20:18,040
it takes like four hours on the single 
player.

1710
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:22,140
Yeah.
But it's got really fun.

1711
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:22,974
Interesting upgrades and spirits and all
the levels have different difficulties 

1712
01:20:26,951 --> 01:20:29,910
and different special conditions and 
it's really surprising.

1713
01:20:29,911 --> 01:20:32,400
It's really fun.
And you have to play to unlock fighters.

1714
01:20:32,401 --> 01:20:36,110
And I was like,
fill that bag.

1715
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,600
What Dan?
Who's your,

1716
01:20:42,601 --> 01:20:43,434
uh,
what's your meaning?

1717
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:46,530
We've been playing a lot of Falcon,
but just,

1718
01:20:46,531 --> 01:20:48,890
just what's available to me.
Yeah.

1719
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,420
Kirby's what's up?
Kirby Darby all day.

1720
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:53,070
Herbie really knows how to fill that 
bag.

1721
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:58,250
[inaudible]

1722
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,860
that's a great,
great sound bite.

1723
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,793
So I'm just kind of like,
I am overwhelmed because I grew up on 

1724
01:21:08,311 --> 01:21:12,060
the end 64 version of Spanish.
When you unlock everything,

1725
01:21:12,061 --> 01:21:14,460
there are 12 fucking character.
I know,

1726
01:21:14,461 --> 01:21:15,294
I know.
And then this new game there's over 70 

1727
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:23,540
low and the the amount of level fucking 
levels there were 900 plus.

1728
01:21:27,061 --> 01:21:29,370
It's the offering.
The pump had your,

1729
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:32,243
I'm a nerd.
Like I grew up on the end like even 

1730
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:34,224
more.
I never had a game cube so I never 

1731
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:36,300
played melee and cubes.
Awesome.

1732
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:39,390
I went right from [inaudible] 64 to weep
so I never had an inbetween.

1733
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:42,510
I know the game cube is a great system,
but like I grew up on the,

1734
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:43,344
on the laggy slow and 64 version.
Like if there were too many characters 

1735
01:21:46,921 --> 01:21:48,780
and smashing and 64 it would slow it 
down.

1736
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:49,614
It would turn into like a powerpoint 
presentation and 15 frames a second and 

1737
01:21:51,931 --> 01:21:54,270
now we're at the sway and play in 
handheld moments.

1738
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:57,080
It's,
it's,

1739
01:21:57,570 --> 01:22:02,550
it's just so fun party over last weekend
and we just like play it.

1740
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,860
I'm not characters.
Have you played online yet?

1741
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:06,930
Because I haven't tried online yet.
I only just bought,

1742
01:22:06,931 --> 01:22:07,764
you know,
it's funny cause I now you have to buy 

1743
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:10,020
online.
Like if the,

1744
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:13,590
which I hate so I just did that the 
other day to play one of my buds.

1745
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,110
Um,
I haven't tried it yet though.

1746
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:17,063
But the online it has a good offer 
because you get to play all the retro 

1747
01:22:19,051 --> 01:22:20,820
games.
You get to stream them.

1748
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,710
Like what are some,
what are some examples of French?

1749
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:28,740
Okay Mario three you get to play like 
original Gallica you get to play it.

1750
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:33,030
There's like a lot of really retro 
fricking cool ass games all stope that's

1751
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,670
a huge part.
I think they keep adding all the classic

1752
01:22:35,671 --> 01:22:36,504
shit there.
That's what they need to do with the 

1753
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:39,293
virtual console.
That's what the wheat and the wheat you 

1754
01:22:40,411 --> 01:22:41,244
had going for it.
They need like more classic [inaudible] 

1755
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:44,223
16 but,
and I think they're doing that so it's 

1756
01:22:46,321 --> 01:22:47,310
really cool.
That's smart.

1757
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:52,490
Fill that bag up with new games.
Here's the Gosh,

1758
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,170
can you go,
here's a,

1759
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,590
here's a neuro.
We got a new story.

1760
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:00,750
We got so many scoops.
Story.

1761
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:05,860
Armored trucks spells cash on Jersey 
highway drivers pull over on the freeway

1762
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:06,694
and rushed to grab dollar bills.
[inaudible] I hope that someone fill it 

1763
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:13,090
back up.
So,

1764
01:23:13,091 --> 01:23:14,410
uh,
a brinks truck.

1765
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:19,411
I guess the back just sprung open and 
like 20 hate when that are just all over

1766
01:23:20,441 --> 01:23:21,880
the freeway.
It's quite as something.

1767
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,230
Um,
now what would cause that to happen?

1768
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:26,093
Like was it triggered to open up to 
spring open or it was just a mechanical 

1769
01:23:30,051 --> 01:23:31,430
malfunction.
It was in an accident.

1770
01:23:31,431 --> 01:23:34,100
And actually I've got a guy,
by the way,

1771
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,800
this poor son of a gun on the freeway 
picking up dollar bills.

1772
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:38,960
That's the brinks guy trying to save his
job.

1773
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,970
Ooh.
Are you serious?

1774
01:23:40,971 --> 01:23:41,804
Yeah,
he's at now when people realize those 

1775
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,740
are dollar bills flying around and not 
garbage,

1776
01:23:45,741 --> 01:23:49,780
I will start pulling over to pick them 
up for the,

1777
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:50,843
for the workers or the poor,
like anyone that has to collect that 

1778
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,910
just a salvage their fucking right.
That's the brinks guide thing.

1779
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,010
Well he's having a good time.
Hey,

1780
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,850
here you go man.
And brings you form is seen here.

1781
01:23:58,851 --> 01:24:02,630
Trying to collect the money thing is 
hilarious.

1782
01:24:02,631 --> 01:24:04,040
Like,
what the fuck else am I going to do?

1783
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:07,460
Uh,
that's scary.

1784
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,290
I mean like you can't just hop out of 
here.

1785
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:10,670
He can't pull over and just hop out of 
your day,

1786
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:12,710
do frogger it,
you know,

1787
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:13,640
they got this guy,
he's like,

1788
01:24:13,641 --> 01:24:15,530
oh,
there's no way.

1789
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,730
Right.
Yeah.

1790
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:18,583
Right.
This was the perfect situation for a 

1791
01:24:20,271 --> 01:24:23,230
little homie though.
He would have filled a lot.

1792
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:29,780
Sit them out like a Roomba.
Oh wait,

1793
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:31,250
no,
no,

1794
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:32,001
that's accurate.
No,

1795
01:24:32,001 --> 01:24:32,601
I think you're right.
No,

1796
01:24:32,601 --> 01:24:34,190
that holds the whole fine.
Yeah,

1797
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,470
that's fine.
I'll take it.

1798
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,420
Can we get an answer?
Is that fine?

1799
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:40,780
Judges?
That's not an,

1800
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:46,703
that'd be fair craft.
I don't think you're going to pick up 

1801
01:24:49,161 --> 01:24:51,830
enough dollar bills paid for that.
No,

1802
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:53,810
this is New Jersey,
so all those accidents,

1803
01:24:53,811 --> 01:24:56,720
we're going to happen anyway.
Whether or not during that turnpike gets

1804
01:24:56,721 --> 01:24:57,321
you,
Amanda.

1805
01:24:57,321 --> 01:25:01,560
The Nj Turnpike,
I've driven it many a time.

1806
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,510
There's a lot of dollars,
baby,

1807
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,280
their 20s,
all of them.

1808
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:09,590
That's one thing.
That's the thing.

1809
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:11,110
They're Japanese,
so it's like,

1810
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:15,590
I don't know if I'm working like minimum
wage,

1811
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:17,500
I'm pulling over and grabbing onto this 
dude.

1812
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:22,280
I can be Mark Walberg.
I'd pull over and grab five 27 30 that's

1813
01:25:22,281 --> 01:25:24,050
true.
I'm mark Walberg.

1814
01:25:24,051 --> 01:25:24,884
I'm pulling over.
I'm punching a Chinese man face and 

1815
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:27,270
blinding him.
Print.

1816
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,780
It might cry or chamber.
Ethan.

1817
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:30,623
I,
I received a message that he may not 

1818
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:34,670
have blinded the man.
He the mind.

1819
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,910
The man was already blind.
He punched her and going,

1820
01:25:36,911 --> 01:25:37,251
man.
Oh,

1821
01:25:37,251 --> 01:25:39,980
what a fucking loser.
I heard he was blinded him and one,

1822
01:25:39,981 --> 01:25:43,950
I suspect he was missing an eye.
He was like an eye know.

1823
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:45,830
Can we pull out,
can you look it up on wikipedia?

1824
01:25:45,831 --> 01:25:47,620
Because I want him to get the facts 
straight on this.

1825
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:50,980
Should we ask Mark Walberg I want to 
know what happened.

1826
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:53,590
What can we do?
We'd have them all time.

1827
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:54,420
Everybody held.
No,

1828
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:54,640
no,
no,

1829
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:54,950
no,
no.

1830
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,660
Don't do that.
I don't want to start trouble with mark.

1831
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,580
I mean tweeted after your hand.
It was a great movie.

1832
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,390
I love,
love it.

1833
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:04,340
Acting.
Mark.

1834
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,350
I love you're acting.
You're a cool guy.

1835
01:26:06,351 --> 01:26:08,090
I left that whole shtick.
I want some kids.

1836
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,510
Yeah.
I think I'm really into this,

1837
01:26:11,511 --> 01:26:12,344
you know,
three kids that said he seemed like a 

1838
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:16,240
happy guy.
He'll see that part.

1839
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,113
Then they fall asleep cause it's like 
he's not gonna be able to make it 

1840
01:26:21,171 --> 01:26:22,004
through the whole podcast pass out.
I have a feeling he's going to let show 

1841
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:29,471
up like he's like smoking from his cryo 
treatment on the door.

1842
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,500
He's like piece of dry ice.
I heard you were talking shit,

1843
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,730
that's not cool,
man.

1844
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:36,920
I been working out for three hours 
today.

1845
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:39,350
I'm interrupted my family time for this.
Okay,

1846
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,570
right.
Drag my kids along.

1847
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:42,590
Now they're going to beat you up.

1848
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:43,700
Now I'm gonna throw down.
Okay.

1849
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:45,710
And I don't want to do this.
I don't want to do this.

1850
01:26:45,711 --> 01:26:46,640
I'm a sweet guy,
you know?

1851
01:26:46,641 --> 01:26:47,990
But you forced me to do this.
Look,

1852
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:48,883
I changed.
I can't open if that Chinese man had a 

1853
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:53,450
week.
I don't blind people anymore.

1854
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:54,811
No,
I'm no expert.

1855
01:26:54,811 --> 01:26:55,644
But a great idea for a podcast is just 
three guys doing mark Walberg and 

1856
01:26:58,361 --> 01:27:00,530
practice to an hour.
That's all it is.

1857
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:03,820
Walberg welcome to the Walberg podcast.
Okay,

1858
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:08,120
we're going to talk about the civil war.
Don't know how it started.

1859
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:13,630
How it ended though would be nice to be 
nice to black people.

1860
01:27:14,061 --> 01:27:14,990
Is it that hard?
I mean,

1861
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:19,370
Hey,
I think treat everyone with respect.

1862
01:27:19,371 --> 01:27:20,600
Am I right guys?
All right.

1863
01:27:20,601 --> 01:27:22,040
That was the podcast.
Thanks for [inaudible].

1864
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,590
I mean black people or people.
Okay.

1865
01:27:24,591 --> 01:27:26,480
I mean,
what's so hard to understand about that?

1866
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:28,490
Lincoln died for it again.

1867
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:32,730
Ah,
I like that.

1868
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:35,760
That's gold.
Absolutely.

1869
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:36,653
And can we get an update on the Maher?
The Walberg we get him to sign a 

1870
01:27:39,631 --> 01:27:40,950
release.
Yeah.

1871
01:27:40,951 --> 01:27:43,200
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to find a good source on it.

1872
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:46,530
And uh,
the story is kind of weird.

1873
01:27:46,531 --> 01:27:50,130
It definitely artists and Martin,
a impression of Mark Wahlberg.

1874
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:51,120
Yeah.
I can't,

1875
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:57,630
I a new kids on the block reunion from 
my,

1876
01:27:57,631 --> 01:27:58,580
uh,
what,

1877
01:27:58,630 --> 01:27:59,463
what was it?
I keep on my calvins to stop the age 

1878
01:28:00,781 --> 01:28:01,614
from getting it.
[inaudible] story for a long time was 

1879
01:28:06,691 --> 01:28:08,460
that he blinded him.
However,

1880
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:13,490
I see an article where they interviewed 
the guy that got beaten up and he claims

1881
01:28:13,861 --> 01:28:14,694
he was already blind in one eye.
And so that was a kind of a miss 

1882
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:18,483
communication.
But the source on this is the daily 

1883
01:28:21,151 --> 01:28:22,020
mail,
which is garbage.

1884
01:28:22,021 --> 01:28:24,900
So who knows that guy?
He was already blind.

1885
01:28:24,990 --> 01:28:25,231
Hey,
can,

1886
01:28:25,231 --> 01:28:26,064
can I,
can I just quickly shout out my wife 

1887
01:28:28,231 --> 01:28:29,064
Erin because she shits on the Daily Mail
every day on our story and it's 

1888
01:28:33,571 --> 01:28:34,404
hilarious.
Like she'll screencap stories and then 

1889
01:28:36,091 --> 01:28:37,830
just write in her like own captions 
like,

1890
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:38,910
um,
it's,

1891
01:28:38,911 --> 01:28:43,100
it's incredible if you want to it on the
day you sent me your Aa newspapers,

1892
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:44,053
I was like a tab and we not find more 
legitimate information cause I'm very 

1893
01:28:47,431 --> 01:28:47,731
good.
Okay,

1894
01:28:47,731 --> 01:28:48,564
well great.
It's already blind was this story 

1895
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:56,490
because I'm talked out,
I was trying to punch it back in.

1896
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:58,570
I was helping him out.
Okay.

1897
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,510
Wouldn't go in the first time.
Yeah,

1898
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,940
you're a lot of Thompson flood.
Yeah,

1899
01:29:02,941 --> 01:29:07,941
I was going to run out of power.
Let me help you.

1900
01:29:09,290 --> 01:29:14,290
I have another very important update on 
the furry penis question God.

1901
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:16,950
And somebody has emailed,
hi Dan.

1902
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:20,700
Watching podcasts right now.
Furries don't paint their pains but,

1903
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:25,500
but there is a website called bad dragon
that has quote wearables,

1904
01:29:25,501 --> 01:29:29,220
which are toys you can put on your pain 
into making it look like an animal.

1905
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:30,380
Get my shape of water.

1906
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:36,360
I guess my question is how prevalent are
these toys and the furry community?

1907
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:37,290
Uh,
he does not.

1908
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:39,960
He's not clarified but enough to support
a,

1909
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,070
a vibrant economy.
And right now what?

1910
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:46,290
Now again,
so you're talking about having a sex act

1911
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:49,090
where your penis doesn't even you cause 
he's,

1912
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:51,810
it's a wearable stirrup on,
I mean people,

1913
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:54,420
people do that.
Well if you have a dick do you strap on?

1914
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:57,540
If you want it to look like a duck's 
corkscrew cock.

1915
01:29:57,541 --> 01:29:58,680
Yeah.
Interesting.

1916
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:00,660
So does your Dick,
I'm just weird.

1917
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:03,680
So does it go over your erect penis or 
you floss it?

1918
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,520
Dan,
that's a good question.

1919
01:30:06,521 --> 01:30:07,950
Hey,
the website's called bad dragon.

1920
01:30:07,951 --> 01:30:08,784
Feel free to pull it away this month.
The circuitry to one to one match your 

1921
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:14,760
pee.
We don't even have that in vr yet.

1922
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:16,830
That's true that,
that'd be the next one.

1923
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:18,870
PSVR too.
I got a question for you guys.

1924
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:24,230
Is fucking a sex robot cheating?
Fuck,

1925
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:25,793
that's a tough one.
That's a tough one because I know that 

1926
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:29,370
sounds like that kind of thing.
We're,

1927
01:30:29,371 --> 01:30:31,050
while I'm fucking a sexual would,
I'd be like,

1928
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:34,140
this ain't cheating.
I'm going to say no.

1929
01:30:34,141 --> 01:30:35,490
I'm going to say no.
I'm going to say,

1930
01:30:35,491 --> 01:30:36,324
I'm going to say no.
I'll be bald and just take a stance and 

1931
01:30:37,921 --> 01:30:38,754
say no because it's a fucking robot.
I don't think it's at what point when 

1932
01:30:41,671 --> 01:30:42,504
you have like super advanced,
like let's say it's got like a 

1933
01:30:44,401 --> 01:30:47,790
personality and it fucking sucks and 
swirls on your Dick,

1934
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:51,090
like no human can and you're like,
you know what?

1935
01:30:51,091 --> 01:30:53,370
I'm going to go take off baby.
I'll be back.

1936
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:54,253
Um,
I'm just going to go hang out and I'll 

1937
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:56,071
be back.
You Go,

1938
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:57,060
you fuck,
you have the best.

1939
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,580
You fuck your robot.
I don't think it's cheating because it's

1940
01:30:59,581 --> 01:30:59,850
a rope.

1941
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:00,990
Yeah.
I will say,

1942
01:31:00,991 --> 01:31:01,980
I'm like,
I'm going to go,

1943
01:31:01,981 --> 01:31:02,814
I'm going to be bullied because,
so do you think eric would be upset if 

1944
01:31:04,921 --> 01:31:06,490
she knew that you were decking out to 
fuck a,

1945
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,180
hey,
I got your back on masturbation.

1946
01:31:09,181 --> 01:31:10,920
That's all it is.
Is it a very interesting,

1947
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:15,950
it depends on the kind of robot and like
if it's in a westward where they're all,

1948
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,480
that's the ultimate in a westworld robot
isn't cheating.

1949
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,790
No,
I don't think so.

1950
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:25,320
Ah,
you know what's funny,

1951
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,180
Aaron and I have talked about this,
she's like,

1952
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:28,053
Oh,
you've fleshed out Luli go to town on 

1953
01:31:29,701 --> 01:31:32,330
some hot robot.
We talked,

1954
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:34,020
you guys,
have you guys have an agreement,

1955
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:38,340
an agreement until that robot says,
um,

1956
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:43,850
so what are we,
I will fucking label on it.

1957
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:45,000
Yeah,
that's what I turn it off.

1958
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:48,500
That's when he reached around and you 
started complaining about,

1959
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,970
I agree.
The robots like,

1960
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:51,871
well,
you know,

1961
01:31:51,871 --> 01:31:53,820
you're going to get rid of it.
You're happier with me.

1962
01:31:54,650 --> 01:31:56,740
Yeah.

1963
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:03,460
Well,
you know,

1964
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:04,293
I didn't think it,
I don't want elog off getting some like 

1965
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:09,610
fucking insane robot cock like 10 inch 
fucking robot,

1966
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,350
insane cock.
But it's purely Tori.

1967
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:14,950
No Web apps.
He's jacked.

1968
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:20,100
He's fucking handsome.
Averagely hung the robot.

1969
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:22,690
Not a big deal.
That's fine.

1970
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:27,040
But if why,
if you go and hang out with the robot,

1971
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:29,580
starts spending time.
Okay.

1972
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:32,680
That's when it gets a little weird when 
you're like,

1973
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,780
when you're not fucking the robot you 
mean?

1974
01:32:34,781 --> 01:32:39,781
Or just like plain smashed with Mike.
He's opening a door and like the robot.

1975
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:45,010
All right.
Get Out.

1976
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:48,443
It's like the printer in your bedroom 
that you have to keep them plugged a 

1977
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:53,733
westward.
Susan one before they found out a data 

1978
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:59,800
lake world loophole.
I'm going to spoil it.

1979
01:32:59,801 --> 01:33:02,230
So if you haven't watched Westworld,
just skip for the next 30 seconds.

1980
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:03,880
Yeah,
you guys have all seen it.

1981
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:04,743
Yeah.
Yeah.

1982
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,113
So when they're in there,
they are scanning their brain to like 

1983
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:11,260
clone them or they're making like 
personality types.

1984
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,633
They're all fucking robots.
They can just collect the semen and 

1985
01:33:14,381 --> 01:33:15,214
cloned them there.
Cause this like a huge seed bank that's 

1986
01:33:18,311 --> 01:33:19,144
all westward as a huge semen bank.
I think the humans just get a bunch of 

1987
01:33:23,351 --> 01:33:24,640
seen it.
But you're not going to like,

1988
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:28,320
I don't know what you'd do with it.
You just get semen though.

1989
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:30,670
Get a bunch of semen dude.
That's all I know.

1990
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,490
That would be really funny if 
westworld's big request was like,

1991
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,970
hey you have 30 kids we've been 
collected.

1992
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:40,270
There are real people and they're your 
kids cause we have so much sema we don't

1993
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:42,330
know what to do with at all.
We just have buckets of semen.

1994
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:45,250
It we save it all tested.
We save all of it.

1995
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:46,263
There's like a volt,
you know they're like the vault with 

1996
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:48,700
everyone's brain.
It's backed up.

1997
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:49,563
It's just,
what if it was just as big a swimming 

1998
01:33:50,681 --> 01:33:54,970
pool of Siemens.
This is a all of our guests.

1999
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:58,580
What is this the ball to come?

2000
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:01,803
We're going to see what that does and 
you're giving the writers too many 

2001
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:06,371
ideas.
You guys,

2002
01:34:06,371 --> 01:34:07,750
you got to lock it up.
Okay.

2003
01:34:07,751 --> 01:34:11,620
You guys can come back.
Spoilers over just a bunch of semen.

2004
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:17,680
No split season two and I am not 
spoiling it off.

2005
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:25,170
Well I gave away the plot a little bit.
A little bit too convoluted like to me,

2006
01:34:29,021 --> 01:34:29,854
like I saw season one and it was fun and
then like I heard I didn't even start 

2007
01:34:32,921 --> 01:34:33,754
season two.
I just heard all these rumors and I 

2008
01:34:34,871 --> 01:34:35,770
liked it.
Really.

2009
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,230
I just heard too many people going like,
what the fuck?

2010
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:41,080
I love.
Well it's not like I got anything better

2011
01:34:41,081 --> 01:34:43,810
to watch.
I can't watch thrones.

2012
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:45,223
Yeah.
I like getting extremely high and 

2013
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:50,100
watching like a handful of shows in 
westworld is one of them because I,

2014
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:52,210
I kind of don't give a shit what 
happens.

2015
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:54,640
I'm not going to get mad.
Whatever they do,

2016
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,890
I'm just going to be like,
all right,

2017
01:34:56,891 --> 01:34:57,980
that's where you're going.
How do you

2018
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:58,990
normally get mad?
Why?

2019
01:34:59,000 --> 01:34:59,833
I'm used this fucking ride.
I feel like I would get a panic attack 

2020
01:35:02,301 --> 01:35:05,300
trying to watch it high because it's 
already so hard to follow.

2021
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:08,270
Like what's going on?
I get panic attacks high anytime,

2022
01:35:08,271 --> 01:35:10,900
so yeah,
I don't have to watch any better sex.

2023
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:12,493
I've never rewatch episodes of a TV show
so many times just to understand what 

2024
01:35:17,121 --> 01:35:19,160
happened.
It's so complicated.

2025
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:20,170
I don't,
I don't,

2026
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:24,110
that's what turns me off.
It's like being that guy,

2027
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,380
that guy.
Wow.

2028
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:30,860
Partly my Iq is to 50 bucks.
Yeah.

2029
01:35:30,861 --> 01:35:33,910
What's it like on your,
a little a pedal on us about the soul.

2030
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:36,663
The way that I washed it is like I 
assume that you understand what you're 

2031
01:35:41,931 --> 01:35:45,250
supposed to and whatnot because no,
you're a duck.

2032
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:50,260
Can't try too hard.
[inaudible]

2033
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:56,030
game of thrones to Youtube 50 well,
I read the book which is required.

2034
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:02,180
I've not read that book.
I love game of thrones,

2035
01:36:02,181 --> 01:36:05,870
but I'll be damned if there were like 
some characters whose names I forget and

2036
01:36:05,871 --> 01:36:09,260
when they pop up sometimes it's like 
this big revelation of character pops up

2037
01:36:09,261 --> 01:36:10,160
and I go,
ah,

2038
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:11,013
fuck who's that again?
Because it's supposed to be this big 

2039
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:14,460
dramatic ball.
What's Your Iq?

2040
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:19,100
It's like 300 something,
but like sometimes I can like an asshole

2041
01:36:19,330 --> 01:36:22,640
and it's been that guy hitting your 
punching bag.

2042
01:36:22,641 --> 01:36:24,420
You got to be that guy.
Someone's got an old guy.

2043
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:26,563
Proudly that guy.
I mean we're going to do saying nice 

2044
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:30,890
things about what's rule.
I like westworld.

2045
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:35,990
Everyone's complaining about like 
inception,

2046
01:36:35,991 --> 01:36:40,991
like I had to watch at 20 times.
It's hard about it.

2047
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:44,290
Anyone's complained about at this time.
It's different.

2048
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:47,600
I'm with you on that one because like 
people complain about that ending and it

2049
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:49,010
being ambiguous.
It's like wow.

2050
01:36:49,011 --> 01:36:51,440
I mean that was the point.
Many movies,

2051
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:56,510
but they're like layers in a,
they're in the Ma to handle it.

2052
01:36:57,230 --> 01:37:00,860
It takes like two tries and you get it.
It's like going into more dreams.

2053
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:01,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

2054
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,660
That's it.
That's more drinks.

2055
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:05,750
It's entertaining.
Well to be frank,

2056
01:37:05,751 --> 01:37:10,751
we do all have at least two 50 Iq.
My Iq is just the letters I in queue,

2057
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:17,050
which could be worse.
I am afraid to take an Iq test.

2058
01:37:17,121 --> 01:37:19,820
I cook can't face the reality that I 
probably have like a 90.

2059
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:22,760
You're not fucking night.
I think I have.

2060
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:27,970
I don't think because,
well I wrote the book,

2061
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:31,820
grandparent,
you're um,

2062
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:33,020
you're not a 90 sign.

2063
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:34,790
You're a one on one year one.
Oh,

2064
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,200
you're award.
No one to me,

2065
01:37:36,201 --> 01:37:38,810
even no matter what the doctors tell 
you,

2066
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:39,673
barely over the mediocre threshold that 
I feel like I'm really bad at like 

2067
01:37:42,261 --> 01:37:43,094
pattern recognition,
which is like a lot of what the Iq is 

2068
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,460
really,
you know,

2069
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:47,913
we did that escape room and me and Isla 
we're set with the task of doing some 

2070
01:37:52,191 --> 01:37:57,191
logic puzzle and I'm,
and I'm like I'm the dominant,

2071
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,473
we couldn't figure it out.
Well escape rooms are different because 

2072
01:38:02,521 --> 01:38:03,354
they,
they,

2073
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:06,010
they put you in a time constraint and I 
feel like doctors,

2074
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:13,050
they're like social like with strangers.
Mostly strangers.

2075
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:15,390
Yeah.
I mean like friends of friends.

2076
01:38:15,391 --> 01:38:17,520
So we didn't know everyone.
Got It.

2077
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:18,623
I learned a lot about myself in the 
escape room in that like I'm kind of a 

2078
01:38:21,211 --> 01:38:25,130
bitch like in a policy way.
Far Away.

2079
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:26,513
Yeah.
It was like,

2080
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:27,373
okay.
So I had the puzzle figured out like I 

2081
01:38:29,101 --> 01:38:34,090
was on my welfare and believe in myself 
that I had it.

2082
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:36,253
I give like a broad stroke here.
Like there were a bunch of books 

2083
01:38:38,761 --> 01:38:41,820
sensitive genius.
The way that you set the books up is,

2084
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:45,670
is the trick because there was like a,
you used the flashlight and it's a black

2085
01:38:45,671 --> 01:38:46,504
light and you run it along the books and
it tells you the combination for the 

2086
01:38:48,181 --> 01:38:49,014
safe.
So I'm over here playing with these 

2087
01:38:49,681 --> 01:38:50,490
fucking books,
like,

2088
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:51,720
oh,
maybe they should be like this,

2089
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:54,750
maybe they should be like this.
And I was starting to get there and then

2090
01:38:54,751 --> 01:38:56,640
someone else,
someone came over this,

2091
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:57,260
the,
the,

2092
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:00,660
the like Alpha male of the group who I 
didn't know it was me.

2093
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:01,750
Where are you wearing your soil boys?

2094
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:05,850
Only on the inner side.
Uh,

2095
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:07,860
and then I was just playing with them 
and I was like,

2096
01:39:07,861 --> 01:39:08,850
yeah,
you give it a try,

2097
01:39:08,851 --> 01:39:11,910
man.
It's just completely had it figured out.

2098
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:12,913
I was probably three minutes away from 
figuring out that I only know that 

2099
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,590
because this other guy came over,
fuck them all up,

2100
01:39:19,591 --> 01:39:21,330
didn't know what he was doing and walked
away.

2101
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:23,090
And then the,
there was a,

2102
01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:24,930
uh,
an actor in the room.

2103
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,820
So there was someone who was like 
chained to the bed.

2104
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:29,000
It was like a Zombie or something like 
that in a while.

2105
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:30,090
And she was like,
you know,

2106
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:32,550
like the rules were don't get near this 
person,

2107
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:34,193
don't touch them.
Which means that someone's touched them 

2108
01:39:35,821 --> 01:39:37,920
before.
There's no,

2109
01:39:37,921 --> 01:39:41,720
I'm sure that it's a rule because 
someone did it right.

2110
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:45,150
Ah,
and she just like,

2111
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:49,500
I could see her break character and get 
exasperated and she walked over,

2112
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:54,501
redid everything I did and set it up,
yelled at it like not with words,

2113
01:39:54,601 --> 01:39:56,590
just went and then like left the way.

2114
01:39:57,330 --> 01:39:58,320
And so I was like,
hey,

2115
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:00,660
so what,
she solved it.

2116
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:01,673
She solved it.
But she did what I did because you 

2117
01:40:08,161 --> 01:40:09,930
didn't have the,
the audacity,

2118
01:40:09,931 --> 01:40:12,330
the courage.
Oh I heard was her calling me a pussy.

2119
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:13,410
That's right.
No,

2120
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:14,400
that's got to fuck with you,
man.

2121
01:40:14,401 --> 01:40:15,900
That's got to fuck if you're with me a 
little bit.

2122
01:40:15,901 --> 01:40:17,250
Cause I was like,
I was right about that.

2123
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:21,930
The confidence for the rest of it.
I tried to take the initiative and I was

2124
01:40:21,931 --> 01:40:24,030
wrong to every other,
all the other,

2125
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:26,851
I was like,
yeah,

2126
01:40:26,851 --> 01:40:29,950
I'm the fucking genius at this.
I got that to fifth.

2127
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:31,820
It's just that one aspect that you were 
right.

2128
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:32,880
Think the one thing.
Yeah.

2129
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:35,430
Um,
I don't like this came from,

2130
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:38,550
I don't like the social situation.
I don't like the social pressure.

2131
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:41,820
I am not alpha,
I'm not outgoing and I'm not smart.

2132
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:44,460
So all those combined,
not a good time.

2133
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:46,620
All those combine trapped in a little 
room.

2134
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:48,480
I think you need to be with the right 
people.

2135
01:40:48,481 --> 01:40:51,130
Like a flashback to middle school.
It's like doing,

2136
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:52,290
I hear that.
I hear you.

2137
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:54,370
I was not good at those tests Jack.
Yeah,

2138
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,233
Mike is,
they used to give us logic tests and 

2139
01:40:57,101 --> 01:40:59,170
middle school and all these fucking 
nerds would like,

2140
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,303
they'll like if Beth had 12 cherries and
George punched her in the pussy and she 

2141
01:41:04,661 --> 01:41:08,250
dropped to exactly what,
they're obviously,

2142
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:09,403
well regardless,
but I was not good at these and there 

2143
01:41:11,411 --> 01:41:13,660
was like the really dumb people.
They,

2144
01:41:13,661 --> 01:41:17,230
I beat them but that wasn't a feed but I
was not head of the pack.

2145
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:22,260
I honestly think if you're with like a 
group of people I know and like you like

2146
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:23,224
you're cool with it.
They're not friends of friends of 

2147
01:41:24,521 --> 01:41:26,680
friends are not like friends three times
removed.

2148
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:27,513
These are you get home,
you're going to have a good fucking 

2149
01:41:28,961 --> 01:41:29,794
time.
I'm going to say I suck at a room 

2150
01:41:32,621 --> 01:41:34,000
escapes.
I've done a number of them.

2151
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:34,870
Have you?
Yeah,

2152
01:41:34,871 --> 01:41:35,704
but I have a good time cause I'm with 
like people I trust and I know and I 

2153
01:41:38,381 --> 01:41:39,070
light.
Yeah.

2154
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:39,731
And it makes the,
hold on.

2155
01:41:39,731 --> 01:41:40,564
Let me ask you this.
Have you ever been like with your 

2156
01:41:42,251 --> 01:41:43,690
friends in an escape room?
Cause he's done a lot.

2157
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:45,430
Have you ever looked at one of your 
friends and said yourself,

2158
01:41:45,431 --> 01:41:46,540
damn,
that guy's fucking dumb.

2159
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:51,850
Yes I have.
I have definitely once.

2160
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:54,280
You don't have to say who,
but what was the situation?

2161
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:56,350
I'll give you his twitter handle and 
everything.

2162
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:57,060
No,
no,

2163
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:57,311
no,
no.

2164
01:41:57,311 --> 01:41:58,150
It was just,
it was just like,

2165
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:00,183
oh,
I'm so dumb that I didn't realize I was 

2166
01:42:01,571 --> 01:42:03,760
doing escape room side of me to play it 
on the bus.

2167
01:42:03,761 --> 01:42:04,594
But yeah,
it was absolutely.

2168
01:42:04,610 --> 01:42:06,340
That's hilarious.
No bad dude.

2169
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:07,263
It was,
um,

2170
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:08,350
no,
it was like,

2171
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:11,380
I don't know the exact example.
It was just like pieces drawn together.

2172
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:13,180
I was wondering what the Hell is going 
on?

2173
01:42:13,181 --> 01:42:14,490
Your hair is popping on the top.

2174
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:21,530
I was like,
that's amazing.

2175
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:24,580
Fill that bag.
That bag of pills.

2176
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:28,750
Um,
no.

2177
01:42:28,751 --> 01:42:31,780
It was just like the guy was clearly 
clueless or girl,

2178
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:33,580
let's not discriminate.
Could have been anyone.

2179
01:42:33,581 --> 01:42:35,660
Could been anyone.
There's dude.

2180
01:42:36,570 --> 01:42:37,403
Yeah it was a guy.
He or she was just like so clueless 

2181
01:42:39,221 --> 01:42:41,590
about like just everything.
They didn't really get it,

2182
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,780
but like it did.
I didn't think less of the person,

2183
01:42:43,781 --> 01:42:45,340
cause I already knew that going in.
I was like,

2184
01:42:45,630 --> 01:42:47,050
I already know this.
I know you're dead weight though.

2185
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,090
I'm dead weight.
It's so,

2186
01:42:49,091 --> 01:42:51,160
it was just kinda like it.
But it was fun.

2187
01:42:51,161 --> 01:42:53,530
Like we just had a good,
so I felt like dead weight.

2188
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:56,260
I did not accomplish anything.
That's fair.

2189
01:42:56,290 --> 01:42:59,950
But there were so many people that it 
was kind of a fun,

2190
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:03,660
my wife did all the caring.
Aaron did all the caring and,

2191
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:07,450
and all the caring and the caring,
the caring and caring.

2192
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:08,800
But like,
and you know,

2193
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:09,733
I was like,
I one I kind of felt like dead weight 

2194
01:43:11,111 --> 01:43:11,944
too.
But on the other hand I was a little 

2195
01:43:12,671 --> 01:43:13,504
proud,
but I still had fun cause I was like 

2196
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:17,200
just with my guys just going like,
I think this goes here.

2197
01:43:17,290 --> 01:43:19,570
Oh fuck or no,
I don't know.

2198
01:43:19,571 --> 01:43:21,520
I think you have to be in the right 
frame of mind.

2199
01:43:21,550 --> 01:43:22,870
But I mean also,
you know,

2200
01:43:22,871 --> 01:43:24,670
if you don't like escape rooms,
you don't like escape room.

2201
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:28,120
We should do an escape room together 
with friends that you trust.

2202
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:28,973
Like,
like not less friends with friends with 

2203
01:43:29,561 --> 01:43:31,600
her.
Wow.

2204
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:34,503
No,
I would,

2205
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:36,053
are you kidding?
I would love to and I suck at escape 

2206
01:43:36,701 --> 01:43:37,501
rooms.
I'm not going to be the guy.

2207
01:43:37,501 --> 01:43:38,261
It's like,
Oh,

2208
01:43:38,261 --> 01:43:41,710
I've done it now.
It's like set up some fucking cameras in

2209
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:44,200
and getting nothing done.
I think that's fine.

2210
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:46,720
We'll have a game broadcast that to the 
world.

2211
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:49,900
Cause I'll look like a fucking,
just do it.

2212
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:51,880
Oh me,
I said,

2213
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,600
Eric,
I want to broadcast it.

2214
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:58,600
Get out of the dreaming mind set for one
fucking charity.

2215
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:01,580
It's always for Sarah Cherry.
Yeah,

2216
01:44:01,581 --> 01:44:02,770
yeah.
Yeah.

2217
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:05,070
Me though.

01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:07,250
Yeah.

01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,083

2222
01:44:14,661 --> 01:44:17,240
What's the name of the charity?
Eric sick kids.

2223
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:20,100
Did you make them sick?

2224
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:23,490
I don't have to answer that.

2225
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:24,890
Mark man kids.
I love that.

2226
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:27,590
They're my kids and they're sick.
All right.

2227
01:44:27,591 --> 01:44:28,910
We need help.
What else do you need to know?

2228
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:29,420
Yeah,
right.

2229
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:30,410
They're really sick,
dude.

2230
01:44:30,411 --> 01:44:31,244
Mind your own business.

2231
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:32,923
What's wrong with them?

2232
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:38,820
I don't have to answer that.
Can I get 10 bucks please?

2233
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:40,103
Um,
we have watched on the show before a 

2234
01:44:41,971 --> 01:44:42,804
compilation of celebrities are not 
performers falling off stage during 

2235
01:44:46,021 --> 01:44:46,854
their performance.
And we had an legendary submission from 

2236
01:44:48,961 --> 01:44:52,000
one of our fans,
Matthew Schelok.

2237
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:56,570
That's a hell of a last name.
Sounds Lachtar Matthew.

2238
01:44:58,270 --> 01:44:59,660
So wait,
matthew was a celebrity.

2239
01:44:59,810 --> 01:45:00,381
No,
no,

2240
01:45:00,381 --> 01:45:02,010
this was the person who submitted it.
Oh,

2241
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:04,110
I'm just celebrity is Gamma Colin

2242
01:45:04,110 --> 01:45:04,891
too?
I'm not familiar with,

2243
01:45:04,891 --> 01:45:05,724
she's a UK something going on in the UK,
but she would cook a fucking 

2244
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,980
unbelievable lifetime.
Make me row the UK.

2245
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:12,030
Yeah,
I don't think so.

2246
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:14,910
Oh,
she's like,

2247
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:15,840
it's like a podcast.

2248
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:18,860
Yeah.
So here's gamma.

2249
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:21,110
Colin's taking the tumble of a lifetime

2250
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:27,860
TV show.

2251
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:37,870
Okay,
wow.

2252
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:39,793
Now this gets real.
They can't lift her up a bit on the 

2253
01:45:42,351 --> 01:45:44,500
heavier side,
the whole game,

2254
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:46,913
the whole game.
But here's what's really funny is this 

2255
01:45:48,701 --> 01:45:50,810
stage,
the guy who controls the stages,

2256
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:51,653
like trying to help her out and he lifts
the fucking stage up cause they can't 

2257
01:45:54,751 --> 01:45:56,010
get her up.
Watch this.

2258
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,530
There's no hydraulic thing.
Yeah,

2259
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:00,461
I see,
I see.

2260
01:46:00,461 --> 01:46:01,960
I see.
She took it.

2261
01:46:01,961 --> 01:46:04,300
She fell into the hole.
She's getting them.

2262
01:46:04,301 --> 01:46:05,134
Good sense of humor about it.
She's like laughing to know she was a 

2263
01:46:06,221 --> 01:46:07,340
sweetheart.
Yeah.

2264
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:10,590
It's got to be embarrassing that I feel 
a little bad for.

2265
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:13,410
That's got a,
she actually does an instant story

2266
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:16,070
here and she's got a lot of charm and 
charisma about it.

2267
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:19,880
Those halls in this space who's putting 
holes in stages,

2268
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:21,870
we saw a lot of people fall victim to 
the fold.

2269
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:27,120
That's not,
she's a superstar

2270
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:34,230
professional.
I just want to let you know I'm alive.

2271
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:39,480
Wembley Stadium,
a tomboy on the stage.

2272
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:40,993
I'm alive guys.
I'm about going back home and we've 

2273
01:46:42,961 --> 01:46:46,110
reached out and when I believe this 
moment down,

2274
01:46:46,590 --> 01:46:47,790
Mj,
hell,

2275
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:50,040
British accent.
Never sound

2276
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,040
real.
She sounds like she's doing a bitch.

2277
01:46:53,041 --> 01:46:54,660
She's a champion man.
She's a chat.

2278
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:56,580
She took a tumble and she took it to 
heart,

2279
01:46:56,581 --> 01:46:57,414
man.
That's what,

2280
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:59,400
what more can you want?
Good for her.

2281
01:46:59,470 --> 01:47:01,020
Oh,
I fell Neil donut.

2282
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,280
Oh,
no stage.

2283
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:05,930
No,
I mean Newell Finn.

2284
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,010
Oh God.
Damn.

2285
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:13,080
Oh,
here's another great one.

2286
01:47:13,081 --> 01:47:14,430
Speaking of it is another,
oh,

2287
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:15,383
this video had me dying.
This mom who is one of the funniest 

2288
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:23,510
things I've seen in a long time,
please don't even tell us anything about

2289
01:47:23,611 --> 01:47:24,440
it.
Just play it.

2290
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:25,350
Okay.
Oh,

2291
01:47:25,351 --> 01:47:26,610
well that's novel,
Jack.

2292
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:29,690
Come on.
What?

2293
01:47:29,690 --> 01:47:31,950
What?
Why don't I just play videos and not say

2294
01:47:31,951 --> 01:47:34,680
anything?
Come on.

2295
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:35,580
Don't say a word.

2296
01:47:37,990 --> 01:47:42,990
Oh,
okay.

2297
01:47:58,770 --> 01:48:00,510
Yeah.
That's a,

2298
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,000
a a a instructor it seems.
Oh No,

2299
01:48:03,001 --> 01:48:08,001
I don't even need to know how they do it
in rally races because it's so intense.

2300
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:10,050
It's a team.
There's two people.

2301
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:11,093
One person drives and one person 
memorizes the course and tells them how 

2302
01:48:13,981 --> 01:48:15,240
hard the turns on.
Yeah.

2303
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:16,620
It's always,
it's a two man sports.

2304
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:18,860
No fucking clue.
Just imagine.

2305
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,100
So,
do you want me to keep talking,

2306
01:48:20,101 --> 01:48:21,810
Jack?
I'm not that fat.

2307
01:48:21,850 --> 01:48:22,140
No,
no,

2308
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:22,531
no,
no.

2309
01:48:22,531 --> 01:48:23,364
I'm photo maps.
Mayor Kulpa was just a human being in 

2310
01:48:26,101 --> 01:48:29,400
your passenger seat.
They're like 0.3.

2311
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:32,430
Why am I doing his accent as the first 
time ever heard an accent?

2312
01:48:32,431 --> 01:48:35,190
I'm not going to do that.
Oh Hell No.

2313
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,390
I need dewalt,
Tommy.

2314
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:39,470
I need to not listen to me for the love 
of God.

2315
01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:40,350
Well,
you're doing is fine.

2316
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,060
Wow.
For the love of God.

2317
01:48:42,061 --> 01:48:44,610
Sammy,
he gets so intense.

2318
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:46,290
Please send me,
I'm begging you.

2319
01:48:46,291 --> 01:48:48,090
You'll have to listen to me.
By the way,

2320
01:48:48,091 --> 01:48:49,890
you owe $2,000
to the irs.

2321
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,240
Sammy.
Listen,

2322
01:48:51,610 --> 01:48:53,220
the irs,
you're going to a rescue.

2323
01:48:53,221 --> 01:48:55,320
Semi blue.
Grama must pay me 10,000

2324
01:48:55,321 --> 01:48:58,140
okay.
I thought that it's from like Africa.

2325
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:02,540
Usually those scans to some of them.
I know where they are.

2326
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:04,980
Right?
There's always the Nigerian prince.

2327
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,690
Yeah,
it,

2328
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:11,820
that one doesn't hold water anymore.
I know.

2329
01:49:11,821 --> 01:49:13,170
I think it's the irs.
No,

2330
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:16,540
listen to me,
Sammy this.

2331
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,750
Those are the new thing.
Yeah.

2332
01:49:18,751 --> 01:49:19,584
I think that's the new hot,
I need that southern gentleman and 

2333
01:49:21,191 --> 01:49:24,030
converted.
Listen to me grandma.

2334
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:25,883
I will fuck you.
They're seeing those on youtube seen 

2335
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:34,590
though at the end hair to like fuck it.

2336
01:49:37,610 --> 01:49:40,590
I go for all of those guys.
That's exactly it.

2337
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:41,970
The Boga.
Yeah,

2338
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,620
that sounds familiar.
Oh yeah.

2339
01:49:43,621 --> 01:49:47,080
He had a folder with like porn.
I knew about the guy like dive in,

2340
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:47,914
but it was like naked mole rats live 
once and watched him do it for like a 

2341
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:55,750
half hour shit and like I'm just eating 
lunch and watching this and I'm like,

2342
01:49:55,751 --> 01:49:59,740
this is better than I know is better 
than sex.

2343
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:07,330
I said it out loud.
Were you masturbating at that time?

2344
01:50:07,331 --> 01:50:09,100
Then the furry on my bed turned and 
said,

2345
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:13,200
what better than my bob?
Is it bad dragon Dan?

2346
01:50:13,610 --> 01:50:14,660
It was bad.
Yeah.

2347
01:50:14,910 --> 01:50:18,400
Yeah.
I think that was my vocabulary.

2348
01:50:18,470 --> 01:50:21,340
That bad dragon.
All right,

2349
01:50:21,341 --> 01:50:24,910
so listen to me,
Sammy for the love of God.

2350
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:28,993
So usually there

2351
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:32,723
manic.
Usually they work very harmoniously and 

2352
01:50:34,821 --> 01:50:35,654
their team and it's very intense.
So he's like a left turn sharp 45 

2353
01:50:39,831 --> 01:50:40,664
degrees.
Yeah,

2354
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,500
that's how they work.
So this,

2355
01:50:42,590 --> 01:50:46,140
so this is like fascinating.
Can you imagine if Siri was like go,

2356
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,153
go,
go.

2357
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:50,300
No,
I don't work well under pressure.

2358
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:52,640
So this is fantastic.

2359
01:50:58,100 --> 01:50:58,933
Please follow the road.
I mean honestly he just has to follow 

2360
01:51:40,371 --> 01:51:45,371
the fucking road really bad.
What are you doing?

2361
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:31,890
That'd be awesome.
Tell me out of drag.

2362
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:35,050
Don't tell me how to literally,
yeah,

2363
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:37,840
literally his job,
he has to be a backseat driver.

2364
01:52:37,870 --> 01:52:38,703
Right.
That means bugging you who are breaking 

2365
01:52:39,791 --> 01:52:42,040
the car.
Don't tell me how to drive.

2366
01:52:42,041 --> 01:52:43,860
That is terrifying.
I mean like I'm,

2367
01:52:43,950 --> 01:52:46,160
I'm a bad enough driver as it is,
but having a guy like

2368
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:47,990
aggressively screen at me.
Yeah.

2369
01:52:47,991 --> 01:52:50,270
I just saw her thumb nail down there.
It's a good thumbnail.

2370
01:52:50,271 --> 01:52:52,370
Thank you for updating our picture of 
Carl Sagan.

2371
01:52:52,371 --> 01:52:54,110
Salvia for,
that's what I noticed too.

2372
01:52:54,111 --> 01:52:54,944
Your turtle neck.
Yep.

2373
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:55,783
Absolutely.
So congratulate thanks to you actually 

2374
01:52:59,571 --> 01:53:04,130
have a song for I like that.
That's all I get.

2375
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:09,280
Is that hot dad was beautiful.
Yes it is hot.

2376
01:53:09,321 --> 01:53:12,260
Dad Shut up to the top.
That hot dad,

2377
01:53:13,110 --> 01:53:16,760
um,
just got a cassette in the mail from Hot

2378
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:18,720
Dad.
Shut out like a tape cassette.

2379
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:23,670
He's selling a tape cassette.
That's fine.

2380
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:27,050
Called them now.
That's what I call hot dad's music.

2381
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:29,180
Shit.
Fucking genius.

2382
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:31,610
He's a genius.
And how was it?

2383
01:53:31,611 --> 01:53:34,490
Did you find anything to play it off?
I've still got into the plastic wrap,

2384
01:53:34,491 --> 01:53:37,760
but in my car I still have a tape deck.
It's going in there.

2385
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:39,440
Where's he based again?
Like,

2386
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:39,980
oh,
I don't,

2387
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:41,810
um,
I don't know if you can disclose that.

2388
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:42,750
I mean like,
yeah,

2389
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,100
don't worry about it.
You,

2390
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:45,100
I'm privy.
Yeah,

2391
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:46,700
that's fine.
Because like I asked,

2392
01:53:46,701 --> 01:53:49,040
because we gotta get him over so we can 
do karaoke and seeing,

2393
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:50,510
um,
I'm in a,

2394
01:53:50,511 --> 01:53:52,820
well,
I cannot see that as an issue,

2395
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:55,790
you know what I mean?
So like Noel,

2396
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:56,810
that's all,
it's not a,

2397
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:57,381
it's not,
no.

2398
01:53:57,381 --> 01:53:59,060
Well,
breakers did Christmas song.

2399
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:01,703
Oh,
we're talking about the classic a 

2400
01:54:02,990 --> 01:54:05,780
songwriter x and the skeleton band fell 
on a,

2401
01:54:05,790 --> 01:54:06,710
well,
I,

2402
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,420
that's a whole rabbit hole.
I apologize.

2403
01:54:08,421 --> 01:54:11,120
I'm just trying to distracting you guys 
from the podcast.

2404
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:12,370
No,
you're not quickly.

2405
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:14,600
I'll get very much.
I,

2406
01:54:14,601 --> 01:54:18,470
uh,
I think it is.

2407
01:54:19,050 --> 01:54:20,480
Wow.
It is.

2408
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:21,930
So there's this,
uh,

2409
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:26,690
like that's impressive.
Drilled in our brains.

2410
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:29,690
I'm sorry.
So here's a couple of Christian grails.

2411
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:34,100
Girl girl defined this.
Now a lot of Christians,

2412
01:54:34,101 --> 01:54:36,650
they wait until marriage to have to have
quite as,

2413
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:39,860
but uh,
we all should as we all should.

2414
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:40,693
As we talked earlier,
abstinence is the only way to prevent 

2415
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:45,980
aids counter to what Mark Walberg would 
have you believe.

2416
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,960
It's not just the Calvin's mark,
sorry.

2417
01:54:47,980 --> 01:54:52,970
But in the pursuit of Jesus's love,
they not only waited to have sex,

2418
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,180
they waited until marriage to kiss.
Oh yeah,

2419
01:54:56,270 --> 01:54:57,103
that sounds right.
Each other or anyone in general married 

2420
01:55:00,681 --> 01:55:04,160
each other.
So did they go from not even kissing the

2421
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:06,080
two?
Sticking it in.

2422
01:55:06,110 --> 01:55:06,943
Okay,
so I'm reading the waiting until 

2423
01:55:08,001 --> 01:55:10,850
marriage to kiss isn't something you'll 
hear much about from pop culture.

2424
01:55:10,851 --> 01:55:12,680
Although saving sex,
kissing,

2425
01:55:12,681 --> 01:55:14,780
or any other intimate act for marriage 
is a rarity.

2426
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:15,793
It can be done.
So that's what they're claiming to have 

2427
01:55:17,451 --> 01:55:18,140
done.
Yes.

2428
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:19,790
Interesting.
I can't wait to see these nuts,

2429
01:55:19,791 --> 01:55:20,624
sex go.
And today we are going to be talking 

2430
01:55:27,381 --> 01:55:31,580
about where's this loving that like 
dislike ratio.

2431
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:32,870
Very solid.
Very,

2432
01:55:32,871 --> 01:55:33,830
very solid.
Yeah.

2433
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:37,490
You to rewind shit right there.
That's a shame.

2434
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:38,533
We'll let,
is there any way we can get them to 

2435
01:55:40,581 --> 01:55:41,414
kiss?
Because lesbian is the most popular 

2436
01:55:42,621 --> 01:55:43,680
category.
I do it

2437
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:44,873
most of the world apparently.
Well Russia wait 20 years and they'll 

2438
01:55:46,861 --> 01:55:50,670
get a kick in in Spain.
Eight years.

2439
01:55:50,830 --> 01:55:51,663
Yeah.

2440
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:56,140
I will be on my honeymoon.
I'm not very young.

2441
01:55:56,620 --> 01:56:01,300
She's going to get some to deal.
I'm so excited.

2442
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:02,633
So when you watch this I will be doing 
all sorts of in and I'm not assuming 

2443
01:56:05,281 --> 01:56:06,390
that.
I'm so excited.

2444
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:09,290
God's a shame.
I've never heard that term.

2445
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:10,183
I'll be doing all sorts of kissing and 
I've never heard that term used on 

2446
01:56:12,921 --> 01:56:14,780
ironically like she means it.
She like,

2447
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:19,430
she's excited about like being so quote 
unquote loose in that,

2448
01:56:19,580 --> 01:56:22,670
in that way it's fascinating loose.
You know what I mean?

2449
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:23,953
In her definition,
like I'll be like she's saying I'm not 

2450
01:56:25,881 --> 01:56:27,480
ashamed to admit it because like yeah,
it's fine.

2451
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:29,030
Only you know.
Yes,

2452
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:30,170
exactly.
Oh,

2453
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:32,630
I can finally,
here's the guy I like kiss.

2454
01:56:33,290 --> 01:56:34,123
Interesting girl.
You should have been kissing from the 

2455
01:56:35,331 --> 01:56:37,760
get go because like we stopped that 
video.

2456
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:38,161
No,
no,

2457
01:56:38,161 --> 01:56:39,500
no.
We've seen that video.

2458
01:56:39,501 --> 01:56:41,450
There's another viral video of like a 
couple,

2459
01:56:41,890 --> 01:56:43,610
um,

2460
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:44,453
um,
like they French kiss at their wedding 

2461
01:56:46,341 --> 01:56:47,174
for the very first time.
You know what I'm talking about that 

2462
01:56:48,351 --> 01:56:49,184
it's like real bad.
It's like that's why that's why your 

2463
01:56:50,830 --> 01:56:52,460

01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:53,600
Yeah.
And it's real crane.

2465

cause that's,
can I say that our sponsors today?

2471
01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:19,690
You're right.
That is true.

2472
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:24,990
Technically on the freaks.
It's like,

2473
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,610
it's like they can you

2474
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:31,270
feel scared.
I started to her.

2475
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:33,010
I said,
yeah,

2476
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:37,940
well it's true.
I'm going to be God raped Eric.

2477

Well at this bourbon is just fan.
So much progress.

2478
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:45,200
It's all me and Jack.
How are you guys still fine?

2479
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:47,170
I don't know.
I really fought hard.

2480
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:49,690
Are you guys feeling it's off guys.
Feel good.

2481
01:57:49,691 --> 01:57:52,360
We felt it in an hour ago.
I don't mean to speak for you,

2482
01:57:52,361 --> 01:57:55,090
but we felt it an hour or two silver.
You know what the problem is?

2483
01:57:55,091 --> 01:57:56,970
I'm pregnant.
Yeah.

2484
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:59,440
So I really messed up.
At least you're being honest,

2485
01:57:59,441 --> 01:58:01,260
man.
Whew.

2486
01:58:01,570 --> 01:58:03,400
Uh,
sweeps week.

2487
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:09,700
Can I tell you what good woody and the 
one thing I'm excited for you that'll be

2488
01:58:09,701 --> 01:58:12,490
pregnant for it.
Besides that we eat pizza every night.

2489
01:58:13,150 --> 01:58:14,870
Fucking my happy place.
Oh yeah.

2490
01:58:15,070 --> 01:58:15,903
Is that when she's about your four 
months pregnant and about four more 

2491
01:58:19,031 --> 01:58:20,140
months?
I think we'll be able to,

2492
01:58:20,230 --> 01:58:22,180
you'll be able to be on like,
oh my God.

2493
01:58:22,970 --> 01:58:24,160
Yeah.
That's like,

2494
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:25,950
you can touch tummies,
touch stomachs.

2495
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:28,330
Oh Dude.
Beach photos.

2496
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,130
That's,
yeah,

2497
01:58:30,190 --> 01:58:31,023
there you go.
In quite nudes or what pregnancies all 

2498
01:58:32,951 --> 01:58:35,170
about are you,
I know,

2499
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:36,093
I know you're Jewish,
but your Christmas cards could be 

2500
01:58:37,991 --> 01:58:40,720
dynamite when you do exactly that.
You just show your,

2501
01:58:40,721 --> 01:58:41,554
you just your,
your

2502
01:58:42,650 --> 01:58:45,000
healing.
You're like laying like on the top of my

2503
01:58:45,001 --> 01:58:45,834
graphs,
your bellies are out so that it looks 

2504
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:49,160
like an hourglass.
Oh,

2505
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:50,480
it will be amazing.
Beautiful.

2506
01:58:50,510 --> 01:58:53,020
It's really it.
Can I refer to class?

2507
01:58:58,420 --> 01:58:59,350
Very excited.
In fact,

2508
01:58:59,351 --> 01:59:02,980
we have an ultrasound a Monday.
Well we find the gender for sure.

2509
01:59:02,981 --> 01:59:05,700
Even though we think it's a boy.
So you want to,

2510
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:08,990
you want cool.
Cool.

2511
01:59:09,490 --> 01:59:10,323
I'm just curious,
has there been like a thing where you 

2512
01:59:13,691 --> 01:59:15,160
guys know like,
like,

2513
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:16,450
oh,
I can tell.

2514
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:20,260
No,
just in the last ultrasound they said it

2515
01:59:20,261 --> 01:59:22,620
looks like it might be a boy.
I wasn't sure.

2516
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:25,720
Are you going to tell the world or keep 
it to yourselves when you find out?

2517
01:59:25,721 --> 01:59:29,650
And we already,
are you going to have a really cool,

2518
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:30,513
um,
gender announcement where you set 

2519
01:59:31,301 --> 01:59:33,730
California on fire?
I saw that.

2520
01:59:35,530 --> 01:59:37,640
Oh Shit.
Wild Bro.

2521
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:39,760
Slow to pixar is a rich,
it was a reach.

2522
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:42,840
I do have a sketch plan that I've 
already said on this shit,

2523
01:59:43,290 --> 01:59:45,040
but I'm going to do it.
I'm going to go,

2524
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:47,950
you know how people put it in like 
confetti and they shoot like blue or,

2525
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:49,013
yeah.
So I'm going to shoot it and it's going 

2526
01:59:50,471 --> 01:59:52,450
to be white and I'm gonna look in the 
screen and say,

2527
01:59:52,570 --> 01:59:55,450
you fucking assumed my baby's gender.
You pigs.

2528
01:59:55,570 --> 02:00:00,570
This is sick fucking dare you.
It's just white.

2529
02:00:02,711 --> 02:00:04,330
You sit,
get real hostile.

2530
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:07,630
The microphone like how fun.
Israel,

2531
02:00:07,631 --> 02:00:10,980
we don't have the baby gender reveal.
They don't have time.

2532
02:00:10,990 --> 02:00:11,823
They just ship them out and it feel like
I don't even have time to look at when 

2533
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:16,953
the leg onto the next one.
I'll give you a quick run through a 

2534
02:00:20,981 --> 02:00:22,130
miracle of birth.
They should.

2535
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:25,090
I think it was a boy,
but I'm free.

2536
02:00:25,091 --> 02:00:26,170
I'm already eight months pregnant.

2537
02:00:26,590 --> 02:00:30,100
She had to do this.
That's how sex that works.

2538
02:00:30,101 --> 02:00:32,680
Huh?
You like if you had like weird like food

2539
02:00:32,681 --> 02:00:34,900
stuff.
I've always heard about.

2540
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:38,500
I am eating pizza now.
It's so weird.

2541
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:39,670
Oh my God.
Nobody likes,

2542
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:43,120
he's the art of it.
I want to hear some crazy shit,

2543
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:43,983
but she eats a lot of pickles,
which is a weird pickles and peanut 

2544
02:00:48,581 --> 02:00:50,800
butter.
I Love Lucy style.

2545
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:51,663
Is that what you're going?
Yeah.

2546
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:54,190
You know the one thing that's been 
happening to me,

2547
02:00:54,191 --> 02:00:55,024
I can go into a rouse like I can't stand
the smell of raw like a really intense 

2548
02:00:58,991 --> 02:01:01,030
fried chicken smell.
But you were like,

2549
02:01:01,031 --> 02:01:01,930
okay.
Beforehand.

2550
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:05,890
Interesting.
It's something heightened like your,

2551
02:01:05,950 --> 02:01:08,430
your your sensitivities maybe.
Okay.

2552
02:01:09,070 --> 02:01:11,470
But she doesn't want to,
she's never been nauseous.

2553
02:01:11,471 --> 02:01:15,160
So I was cooking chicken the other day 
and she had a panic attack.

2554
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:16,720
Oh Shit.
Oh,

2555
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:17,573
chicken.

2556
02:01:17,930 --> 02:01:22,930
A trigger trigger me in general.
Okay.

2557
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:25,983
Spooks.
You like to live that vegetarian life 

2558
02:01:27,191 --> 02:01:29,620
for a little bit apparently.
That's fine.

2559
02:01:29,621 --> 02:01:30,454
You're in La.
There are worse places to be Vegan or 

2560
02:01:31,691 --> 02:01:32,524
vegetarian and you can get it.
You gotta fucking Burger with 

2561
02:01:34,061 --> 02:01:35,770
everything.
But it's very in style.

2562
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:37,900
What time we were in Mexico,
I may have told the story about it.

2563
02:01:37,901 --> 02:01:39,220
I just,
it's so funny.

2564
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:41,900
We literally were dying laughing,
right?

2565
02:01:41,901 --> 02:01:44,840
A pizza place in Mexico and we ordered 
the,

2566
02:01:44,841 --> 02:01:46,370
on the menu,
there's a pizza with like,

2567
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:47,830
you know,
Bell Peppers,

2568
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:52,130
black olives,
mushrooms and pepperoni.

2569
02:01:52,490 --> 02:01:53,323
And we sell we,
so we say we want this one but no 

2570
02:01:54,921 --> 02:01:56,360
pepperoni.
And he's like,

2571
02:01:56,780 --> 02:01:58,010
oh,
so do you want bacon?

2572
02:01:58,150 --> 02:01:58,761
And we're like,
no,

2573
02:01:58,761 --> 02:01:59,510
me.
And he's like,

2574
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:00,530
oh,
so do you want steak?

2575
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:01,430
And we're like,
no meat.

2576
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:02,101
He's like,
oh,

2577
02:02:02,101 --> 02:02:02,990
so do you want pork?

2578
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:03,973
We're like,
no meat.

2579
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:07,750
Like he couldn't fathom.
It.

2580
02:02:07,751 --> 02:02:09,590
Just didn't make,
we thought he was enrolling us.

2581
02:02:09,591 --> 02:02:10,424
We started looking at each other and 
just laughing because it was getting so 

2582
02:02:12,411 --> 02:02:17,411
crazy.
What do you mean he couldn't understand?

2583
02:02:17,871 --> 02:02:20,160
He thought he was misunderstanding.
Oh my God,

2584
02:02:20,570 --> 02:02:22,340
you're throwing bags at him.
I was like,

2585
02:02:22,341 --> 02:02:23,960
no,
fucking me dude.

2586
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:26,540
I thought he was fucking with me.
Like get the fucking picture.

2587
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:28,860
That's fascinating.
Yeah.

2588
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:31,500
What else?
Is there fun?

2589
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:34,410
Would food?
Um,

2590
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:38,150
like do you guys cook a lot at home or 
like order out?

2591
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:41,990
I like it when we cook,
but sometimes we get too busy.

2592
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:43,840
It's a chore.
Yeah.

2593
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:44,743
Yeah.
It's tough.

2594
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:47,810
She's eating a lot.
That's what's up.

2595
02:02:49,190 --> 02:02:50,840
Yeah.
And I've gained weight.

2596
02:02:50,841 --> 02:02:51,674
There's no question.
I think I've gained like 10 fucking 

2597
02:02:52,671 --> 02:02:53,930
pounds.
If I'm being honest.

2598
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:58,660
Then you've been pregnant and I'm having
like the craziest shits,

2599
02:02:58,670 --> 02:02:59,960
like so much shit.

2600
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:01,960
Like it's crazy.
I'm sorry.

2601
02:03:03,790 --> 02:03:04,623
I just want to know.
My shits have been insane and here's 

2602
02:03:05,961 --> 02:03:06,794
something they don't tell you about 
antidepressants that I learned ever 

2603
02:03:09,201 --> 02:03:12,880
since I started taking those.
My shifts have been a one time.

2604
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:16,760
He's like,
no,

2605
02:03:16,820 --> 02:03:20,180
like quality is amazing.
I know it's gross,

2606
02:03:20,181 --> 02:03:22,050
but you got to come in and you've got to
look at it.

2607
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,540
We'll see.
Right to call you in.

2608
02:03:23,910 --> 02:03:24,890
It was fine.
It was like,

2609
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:25,813
well no,
because I'm playing some fucking dude 

2610
02:03:28,170 --> 02:03:29,003
[inaudible] I always had like diarrhea,
really loose nasty bowel movements and 

2611
02:03:34,810 --> 02:03:35,643
lots of cleaning issues.
And so my shits are like beautifully 

2612
02:03:38,631 --> 02:03:40,650
sculpted one way.
Yeah,

2613
02:03:40,910 --> 02:03:41,743
like the quality like,
and then I'll be taking like the fatty 

2614
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:46,960
shipment to size and tact one piece 
intact.

2615
02:03:46,970 --> 02:03:47,803
Like guys in my whole forearm.
Like I haven't been having shits like 

2616
02:03:50,541 --> 02:03:51,860
this since I was like 12.

2617
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:52,740
What's the secret?
Are you,

2618
02:03:52,970 --> 02:03:55,640
how are you eating differently or you're
not a monster?

2619
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:57,690
It's the antidepressant,
I guess it,

2620
02:03:57,730 --> 02:03:58,563
Oh,
I'm sorry.

2621
02:03:58,970 --> 02:04:00,950
Metamucil anymore.
And I do take the Metamucil,

2622
02:04:00,951 --> 02:04:05,450
but before I started the antidepressant,
my shifts weren't that much better.

2623
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:06,793
Like at least the form.
But then I guess I guess the 

2624
02:04:09,231 --> 02:04:11,960
antidepressant makes you constipated and
it even me out.

2625
02:04:12,090 --> 02:04:14,450
Oh,
that's interesting.

2626
02:04:14,510 --> 02:04:17,810
I can shit.
And like you had like an emergency break

2627
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:21,290
sort of thing going on where like beyond
what?

2628
02:04:21,291 --> 02:04:22,370
Uh,
what like uh,

2629
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:24,990
someone else.
In a similar situation would need,

2630
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:25,853
maybe they will.
Maybe the negative effect was a 

2631
02:04:27,771 --> 02:04:28,490
positive,
right?

2632
02:04:28,490 --> 02:04:29,323
That's right.
And sometimes I wonder if sometimes I 

2633
02:04:31,461 --> 02:04:32,294
wonder if the antidepressant works at 
all or if I'm just happy all the time 

2634
02:04:36,171 --> 02:04:37,710
cause my shit just go off the chain.

2635
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:42,060
I get excited every day when I shit 
fiber pills,

2636
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:43,070
I swear to God.
Yeah,

2637
02:04:43,110 --> 02:04:45,240
group therapy,
they're just straight fiber.

2638
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:49,530
I get excited every day,
every day and I swear to God,

2639
02:04:49,531 --> 02:04:50,364
it's the highlight of my day.
It's like because I've been living my 

2640
02:04:51,781 --> 02:04:56,781
life with this nightmare of shits I've 
shits and now it's just like,

2641
02:04:58,890 --> 02:05:01,740
hmm.
I come out dancing and celebrate that.

2642
02:05:01,741 --> 02:05:02,574
That's,
do you guys have a nice quality bell or 

2643
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:09,120
you know,
it's all ebb and flow line with all flow

2644
02:05:09,121 --> 02:05:12,660
and no hub.
I got my hills and valleys.

2645
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:14,700
We absolutely,
absolutely.

2646
02:05:15,190 --> 02:05:18,550
I was shitting.
I'll water free years wrong with me.

2647
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:20,920
I've been perpetually dehydrated.
If,

2648
02:05:20,940 --> 02:05:23,910
if we were alive a hundred years ago,
you'd have died of dysentery,

2649
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:29,590
dysentery.
You thought of that for sure.

2650
02:05:29,990 --> 02:05:30,823
No,
I'm not sure I would have died on the 

2651
02:05:33,031 --> 02:05:35,330
Oregon trail.
No offense.

2652
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:37,980
I would've never left.
I mean like we all pay the fucking game.

2653
02:05:37,980 --> 02:05:39,990
It was,
it was ethan died of dysentery.

2654
02:05:40,050 --> 02:05:40,890
Terrifying.
Yeah.

2655
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:44,880
That alone shocked me to my core about 
moving anywhere,

2656
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:46,553
right?
Like what's the incentive to move 

2657
02:05:47,671 --> 02:05:48,950
anywhere after playing that game?
That,

2658
02:05:48,951 --> 02:05:51,050
what does that mean?
I'm sorry,

2659
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:51,893
I don't want to go anywhere.
Remember when games were on fucking 

2660
02:05:53,851 --> 02:05:55,320
floppy disks get me,
you know,

2661
02:05:55,710 --> 02:05:57,660
like a hunt,
like 1.4,

2662
02:05:57,661 --> 02:05:59,430
four megabytes could call it a whole 
game.

2663
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:03,600
You guys remember the turtle game stuff 
with the little turtle Qwerty or,

2664
02:06:03,601 --> 02:06:04,434
yeah,
I remember the turtle turtle where 

2665
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:10,560
Qwerty coordinates.
But you could pro programming exercise.

2666
02:06:10,651 --> 02:06:11,484
But all I say,
never have ever understood programming 

2667
02:06:13,861 --> 02:06:14,694
in my life.
So all it was to me was a turtle game 

2668
02:06:17,130 --> 02:06:19,260
where you tell this little turtle to go,
all right,

2669
02:06:19,261 --> 02:06:21,660
go over halfway across the screen,
a little buddy.

2670
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:23,820
And he does it,
but he draws a line behind them.

2671
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:27,540
You all right?
And I'll go down and then you would make

2672
02:06:27,541 --> 02:06:31,600
like a star in my case,
I would like make pentagram course.

2673
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:32,520
Of course.
No,

2674
02:06:32,521 --> 02:06:35,000
I remember like the turtle game.
Yeah,

2675
02:06:35,570 --> 02:06:39,990
I didn't like math blaster and typing 
and there was like these sick ass typing

2676
02:06:39,991 --> 02:06:41,360
games.
Mavis speed.

2677
02:06:41,370 --> 02:06:42,560
Titus.
Yeah.

2678
02:06:42,660 --> 02:06:43,493
Maybe chat was not a real person.
Have you guys ever played the newspaper 

2679
02:06:49,091 --> 02:06:50,250
again?
Where you throw it in?

2680
02:06:50,251 --> 02:06:53,280
What's the newspaper boy?
Oh sure,

2681
02:06:53,281 --> 02:06:54,114
sure,
sure.

2682
02:06:55,410 --> 02:06:56,243
I think that's the first possible was 
ever an event like that should be a 

2683
02:07:03,331 --> 02:07:05,540
great smash fighter.
Oh,

2684
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:07,360
Jack.
If paper will,

2685
02:07:07,361 --> 02:07:09,810
it becomes a smash fighter.
I think you should take credit now.

2686
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:14,790
He should be on the record.
What else will they be on?

2687
02:07:14,810 --> 02:07:15,643
Yeah,
fuck yeah,

2688
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:16,800
just throwing shit.
Yeah.

2689
02:07:16,801 --> 02:07:18,360
I play Mavis beacon online.
Maybe.

2690
02:07:18,361 --> 02:07:20,710
You know you got their attention with 
that nes video,

2691
02:07:20,711 --> 02:07:21,600

2694

2695
02:07:30,030 --> 02:07:33,390
Y'All want to step this podcast up and 
watch me play Mavis beacon live.

2696
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:34,380
Oh my God.
Fuck it up.

2697
02:07:34,890 --> 02:07:36,070
Yeah,

2699
02:07:40,610 --> 02:07:41,391

2700
02:07:41,391 --> 02:07:42,970
they turn into a crazy,
yes.

2701
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:43,933
Wait,
I'm clicking start big or fires out of 

2702
02:07:45,111 --> 02:07:47,210
five according to the rating.
That's great.

2703
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:50,510
That's a,
that's a solid 80% is you almost have to

2704
02:07:50,511 --> 02:07:52,860
evacuate the house with that many damn 
proud.

2705
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:55,220
Let's go back.
1987 go back to the lesbians.

2706
02:07:55,250 --> 02:07:55,851
Oh yeah.
Right.

2707
02:07:55,851 --> 02:07:58,320
Remember we were talking about,
they were about,

2708
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:01,820
I mean,
look how low her blouses that girls have

2709
02:08:01,821 --> 02:08:02,654
straight up got shank like I can,
I can almost see her cleavage joke is 

2710
02:08:13,431 --> 02:08:15,320
that they're not eggs.
We got no,

2711
02:08:15,321 --> 02:08:16,250
we got it.
We got it.

2712
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:17,383
Thank you.
The joke is they're clearly yours might 

2713
02:08:18,801 --> 02:08:21,080
not get it.
We clearly have too many walls up.

2714
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:22,873
I think this necklace is way too 
provocative and the fact that she's 

2715
02:08:25,581 --> 02:08:26,414
drawing attention to her,
that it's drawing away too much 

2716
02:08:27,521 --> 02:08:29,600
attention to her beautiful neck line and
it's just frankly,

2717
02:08:29,601 --> 02:08:30,540
I'm uncomfortable.
I'm,

2718
02:08:30,630 --> 02:08:32,750
and I'm getting a little turned on and 
it's just,

2719
02:08:32,751 --> 02:08:36,760
it's too much.
I know what you think's been dirty.

2720
02:08:36,770 --> 02:08:37,603
Skank wearing a necklace like that.
She's a nasty little hose about to go 

2721
02:08:41,391 --> 02:08:43,880
kiss a lot this week.
I can't wait for the verge.com

2722
02:08:44,010 --> 02:08:46,940
disgusting.
It utuber calls another beautiful,

2723
02:08:47,120 --> 02:08:48,560
innocent utuber.
Yeah,

2724
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:50,510
that's on you.
You hit play and she's like,

2725
02:08:50,511 --> 02:08:51,980
so anyway,
my dad's a lawyer.

2726
02:08:54,150 --> 02:08:57,060
Fuck h three calls.
Pure Christian girl.

2727
02:08:57,061 --> 02:08:58,000
A skank.
Right.

2728
02:08:58,040 --> 02:08:58,910
Thank you.
Yeah.

2729
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:00,530
There's a lot of that going on right 
now.

2730
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:03,710
Oh,
she's a skank and oh yeah,

2731
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:05,780
no,
she's fine.

2732
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,380
She's okay.
They're fine.

2733
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:08,540
They're joe.
Where's this go home?

2734
02:09:08,650 --> 02:09:09,483
You do with that?
I actually could be getting worse 

2735
02:09:12,970 --> 02:09:15,850
somehow.
US making the biggest fool myself,

2736
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:18,140
my wife,
and that may be so weird because some of

2737
02:09:18,141 --> 02:09:18,711
y'all,
you might be like,

2738
02:09:18,711 --> 02:09:19,544
I have never heard of that,
but it's actually been a really cool 

2739
02:09:22,131 --> 02:09:24,260
thing and I'm,
I'm actually really excited about it.

2740
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:24,920
No,
it hasn't.

2741
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:26,850
I'm excited now to get saved,
but when you watch this,

2742
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:30,340
you can get,
I had God's anointing came about.

2743
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:33,680
I'll just always knew when I was a 
teenager.

2744
02:09:33,681 --> 02:09:34,550
Right.
Both of us.

2745
02:09:34,551 --> 02:09:35,384
Yeah.
I remember you read these books by some 

2746
02:09:36,381 --> 02:09:38,210
Christian authors and they were sharing 
about how

2747
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:44,650
I'd feel bad making fun of these girls 
need what I,

2748
02:09:44,651 --> 02:09:45,540
yeah,
yeah.

2749
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:48,520
I think because it's like,
oh man,

2750
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:53,650
if only they had had a regular 
upbringing,

2751
02:09:53,830 --> 02:09:54,663
upbringing.
Yeah,

2752
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:55,380
I give you the,
no,

2753
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:58,280
they wouldn't blink of kissing as,
as,

2754
02:09:58,281 --> 02:09:59,051
as,
as this,

2755
02:09:59,051 --> 02:10:01,210
as this something,
the wheat unholy.

2756
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:02,290
Right,
right.

2757
02:10:02,410 --> 02:10:04,510
Absolutely.
Really cool.

2758
02:10:05,470 --> 02:10:06,430
Yeah.
Now she does,

2759
02:10:06,431 --> 02:10:08,830
but Jesus Christ.
Well she thinks that what is cool.

2760
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:10,270
Waiting,
waiting,

2761
02:10:10,330 --> 02:10:11,140
waiting to yes.
Okay.

2762
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:12,520
Okay.
Cause that's the two different things.

2763
02:10:12,521 --> 02:10:14,110
Kissing or waiting to kisses.
Cool.

2764
02:10:14,140 --> 02:10:16,000
So that's what I'm always cause he's 
excited.

2765
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:17,440
Okay.
And that's fair.

2766
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:20,150
And she never had a summer as a world 
where you know,

2767
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:23,560
you're waiting to kids.
That's like Jesus.

2768
02:10:23,561 --> 02:10:24,630
That's part of growing up.
Your,

2769
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:26,500
your first kiss when it's like,
you know,

2770
02:10:26,570 --> 02:10:29,600
you white boy meets world episode.
Yeah.

2771
02:10:30,050 --> 02:10:32,710
Shoves corey up to hang a,
shoves him up against the locker.

2772
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:36,140
Y'All know what I'm talking about.
Thank you.

2773
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:39,040
I know that episode.
That was amazing.

2774
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:43,340
Can we,
I want to say,

2775
02:10:43,790 --> 02:10:47,390
do you remember your first kiss era?
Um,

2776
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:49,370
I do.
It was at a summer camp.

2777
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,890
Tell me about it.
Give me the details.

2778
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:52,813
I mean it was,
it was like completely embarrassing and 

2779
02:10:54,621 --> 02:10:55,454
weird and silly.
But like I was super young and it was 

2780
02:10:59,181 --> 02:10:59,721
like,
all right,

2781
02:10:59,721 --> 02:11:02,660
got that out of the way.
Why was that weird?

2782
02:11:02,690 --> 02:11:05,530
That's literally exactly what it was.
Yeah.

2783
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:07,730
It was just like,
Oh yeah,

2784
02:11:07,731 --> 02:11:12,731
it was 20 counselor last week.
I fired me.

2785
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:16,760
I was a counselor.
I was like,

2786
02:11:16,761 --> 02:11:21,761
why was this so weird?
[inaudible]

2787
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:29,500
I was super embarrassed and I really 
follow through.

2788
02:11:29,931 --> 02:11:31,460
She was super,
I was like,

2789
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:32,383
it was back when I was,
she was into it and I must have been 

2790
02:11:35,511 --> 02:11:40,511
like 12 that's you and I ran away and I 
couldn't do it.

2791
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:43,800
Couldn't fall through,
ran away.

2792
02:11:45,170 --> 02:11:47,180
Yes,
because I was too embarrassed.

2793
02:11:47,181 --> 02:11:49,280
I couldn't put a pussy because you 
weren't awake?

2794
02:11:49,790 --> 02:11:51,320
No.
I mean I fucked the shit out of her.

2795
02:11:53,150 --> 02:11:57,500
I remember I liked her.
That girl that I,

2796
02:11:57,610 --> 02:11:58,970
that I kissed,
it was like,

2797
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:00,980
okay,
we're girl girlfriend,

2798
02:12:00,981 --> 02:12:01,814
boyfriend now staying with my grandma to
go to this summer camp and I came home 

2799
02:12:06,081 --> 02:12:07,580
on the bus from the summer camp and I 
was like,

2800
02:12:07,880 --> 02:12:08,713
I have a girlfriend.
And then I came home and I went to bed 

2801
02:12:11,091 --> 02:12:12,860
and woke up,
went to fucking summer camp.

2802
02:12:12,861 --> 02:12:17,540
The next day and then like I didn't know
what to do and then she was like sitting

2803
02:12:17,541 --> 02:12:20,480
over there and I was sitting over here 
with my buddies and I was like,

2804
02:12:20,481 --> 02:12:21,230
do I go over there?

2805
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:22,160
And they were like,
I don't know.

2806
02:12:22,161 --> 02:12:27,161
We've [inaudible] right.
We're the ones good at sports.

2807
02:12:28,911 --> 02:12:29,744
Why the fuck did you and uh,
and then later in the day she walked 

2808
02:12:33,051 --> 02:12:34,670
over with all of her friends and she was
like,

2809
02:12:34,671 --> 02:12:37,650
I decided a,
we're not boyfriend and girlfriend.

2810
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:39,410
I was like,
all right,

2811
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:43,940
I don't blame you.
It was fun.

2812
02:12:44,270 --> 02:12:44,750
Right,
right.

2813
02:12:44,750 --> 02:12:45,860
Yeah.
You got yours baby.

2814
02:12:45,890 --> 02:12:46,521
I was like,
Yo,

2815
02:12:46,521 --> 02:12:47,354
I got mine.
And then like shades came out of the 

2816
02:12:48,561 --> 02:12:50,780
heavens and just the,
because obviously deal with it.

2817
02:12:50,781 --> 02:12:51,614
Yeah.
Did you guys do the heart Nicholas's 

2818
02:12:54,060 --> 02:12:56,780
they're like break into half.
Did you do that with boys?

2819
02:12:56,860 --> 02:12:58,670
No,
he did that with boys.

2820
02:12:59,180 --> 02:13:00,520
You'd ever tell me that?
Ila,

2821
02:13:01,470 --> 02:13:02,303
tell me that stuff.

2822
02:13:05,550 --> 02:13:07,100
Jack.
Don't let them know about our,

2823
02:13:07,101 --> 02:13:09,620
her necklaces blocked out song.
It'd be weird.

2824
02:13:10,290 --> 02:13:11,123
We would,
someone would give it to you and then 

2825
02:13:12,921 --> 02:13:14,420
you're like girlfriend,
boyfriend.

2826
02:13:14,421 --> 02:13:17,390
But it doesn't mean anything like you're
not even know that was a thing.

2827
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:20,330
Tangible pieces of afternoon indicating 
that you are,

2828
02:13:20,331 --> 02:13:22,610
in fact,
you get lots of offerings.

2829
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:24,980
Do you get half hearts from multiple 
boys?

2830
02:13:25,310 --> 02:13:26,840
What happens if you get too many 
suitors?

2831
02:13:27,730 --> 02:13:30,080
I don't even remember anything.
It wasn't anything like that.

2832
02:13:31,270 --> 02:13:32,940
What was,
what was your first kiss?

2833
02:13:32,941 --> 02:13:33,774
I'm not sure.
I know.

2834
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:35,573
Yeah,
right.

2835
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,860
You don't remember your first kiss?
Everyone does.

2836
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:42,360
He does.
You just don't want to talk about it,

2837
02:13:42,361 --> 02:13:45,480
but that's fine.
I don't think I remember getting cannot.

2838
02:13:45,650 --> 02:13:46,483
Okay,
that's fine.

2839
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:49,860
Let me go.
I'll tell you mine.

2840
02:13:49,861 --> 02:13:52,500
I got a juicy one.
I was in,

2841
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:54,060
I was a late bloomer.
Okay.

2842
02:13:54,190 --> 02:13:56,160
I'm really thinking about it.
Please,

2843
02:13:56,161 --> 02:13:56,880
please.
Yeah,

2844
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:58,620
go ahead.
Let her let her,

2845
02:13:58,750 --> 02:14:02,070
let her recollect.
New Ghost stories.

2846
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,033
I wasn't risky stores.
I was 16 and I liked a girl who had a 

2847
02:14:08,581 --> 02:14:10,350
boyfriend.
That wasn't me.

2848
02:14:10,690 --> 02:14:11,523
Yeah,
it was juicy,

2849
02:14:12,240 --> 02:14:14,790
but she liked me kind of.
Yeah,

2850
02:14:14,791 --> 02:14:17,370
she liked me.
So what happened was we went to like,

2851
02:14:17,970 --> 02:14:21,600
I went to her house,
but we went to like she happened to have

2852
02:14:21,601 --> 02:14:24,440
in her backyard.
She had a creek like,

2853
02:14:24,441 --> 02:14:25,680
Woo,
I like where this is going.

2854
02:14:26,360 --> 02:14:31,360
It was like in the fall or when go to 
and we like wait into the creek a little

2855
02:14:33,121 --> 02:14:33,811
bit,
you know,

2856
02:14:33,811 --> 02:14:35,940
with like running water and you know,
it's like a brook.

2857
02:14:36,100 --> 02:14:37,650
I don't know that there's a bit of work 
in the creek,

2858
02:14:37,651 --> 02:14:41,010
but it's closed as you relive this 
magical moment.

2859
02:14:41,011 --> 02:14:42,780
It was the hottest moment of my life,
man.

2860
02:14:44,970 --> 02:14:46,010
When I was 69.
Pete.

2861
02:14:46,590 --> 02:14:47,560
No.
Um,

2862
02:14:47,610 --> 02:14:49,460
so like,
and she had this boyfriend and I did,

2863
02:14:49,470 --> 02:14:50,191
she was like,
all right,

2864
02:14:50,191 --> 02:14:51,024
close your eyes.
And we kissed while we were in this 

2865
02:14:52,981 --> 02:14:55,200
brook slash ski show.
That's a beautiful,

2866
02:14:55,201 --> 02:14:57,390
magical thing.
And she was like taken,

2867
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:01,440
but she was my first kiss.
She was taken but smitten,

2868
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:04,740
aptly put my friend aptly put,
damn,

2869
02:15:04,741 --> 02:15:08,110
you're a fucking pimp dude.
But like beyond that,

2870
02:15:08,130 --> 02:15:09,510
so he stayed with him.
Yeah,

2871
02:15:09,511 --> 02:15:10,344
of course.
Yeah.

2872
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:13,530
I got kicked heavily,
but she was my first kiss.

2873
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:16,290
So in other words,
I got mine.

2874
02:15:17,310 --> 02:15:18,870
Oh wait,
was that,

2875
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:20,660
that must have been tough for you.
Uh,

2876
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:21,883
because that's,
uh,

2877
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:25,890
that's some bullshit as a young man to 
cock tease like that.

2878
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:26,491
Oh,
absolutely.

2879
02:15:26,491 --> 02:15:30,780
I suffered immensely because like,
we both clearly liked each other.

2880
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:31,740
This girl and I,
you know,

2881
02:15:31,741 --> 02:15:33,570
I just kind of,
he had a boyfriend,

2882
02:15:34,340 --> 02:15:36,000
she was Kinda to time and you know,
but it's like,

2883
02:15:36,001 --> 02:15:36,780
you know,
it's,

2884
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:38,790
that's the game of love.
We all play the game of luck.

2885
02:15:38,970 --> 02:15:42,060
You just weren't equipped yet to to get 
it.

2886
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:44,430
Oh God.
I wasn't equipped for anything.

2887
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:46,470
I was 16.
I was playing smashed my basement,

2888
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:48,270
you know.
Where is she now?

2889
02:15:48,271 --> 02:15:52,410
She's still in that creek.
The son of a bitch.

2890
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:53,273
I think she's the one that creek,
I think she's waiting with like Arthur 

2891
02:15:55,671 --> 02:15:58,440
sword.
Yeah.

2892
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:02,370
Season three of uh,
making a murderer,

2893
02:16:02,371 --> 02:16:03,204
I think.
Yeah,

2894
02:16:03,450 --> 02:16:07,220
the first and last time she learned her 
fucking lesson.

2895
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:08,423
Wouldn't it be hilarious if the new 
season of true detective arid and like 

2896
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:13,560
Jack is the murderer.
He's,

2897
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:17,640
he's like legally yellow king.
There's an nda where he can't tell us.

2898
02:16:19,090 --> 02:16:19,923
We were like doing this podcast and like
we were talking about the new season of 

2899
02:16:22,891 --> 02:16:24,090
true detective was like joking like,
yeah,

2900
02:16:24,091 --> 02:16:25,460
totally.
No,

2901
02:16:25,470 --> 02:16:27,210
I don't know what's going to happen.
She was crazy.

2902
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:31,390
Watch the last episode.
It was like a whole tire chains creek.

2903
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:32,693
I had my first kiss.
I somehow gained like 50 pounds for the 

2904
02:16:34,511 --> 02:16:35,570
roles and all that.
Good.

2905
02:16:35,571 --> 02:16:36,200
They're all,
you know.

2906
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:36,910
Yeah,
yeah,

2907
02:16:36,910 --> 02:16:37,750
yeah.
Gained it.

2908
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:39,610
It's all 50 pounds of muscle.
What else?

2909
02:16:39,630 --> 02:16:40,331
We got?
Well,

2910
02:16:40,331 --> 02:16:41,164
speaking up,
hold on just backtracking a little bit 

2911
02:16:42,491 --> 02:16:44,800
because we talked about the lovely bones
a little bit.

2912
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,633
Oh yeah.
So Ryan Gosling of all people was 

2913
02:16:47,861 --> 02:16:52,861
supposed to be the villain in the lovely
bones and he gained a significant amount

2914
02:16:53,381 --> 02:16:54,820
of weight.
You're supposed to be the villain.

2915
02:16:54,850 --> 02:16:55,683
He's supposed to be the villain.
He's about to like the Martin about and 

2916
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:57,413
the lovely bones.
It's about a girl who gets raped and 

2917
02:17:00,221 --> 02:17:01,600
killed.
Oh,

2918
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:02,743
comedy.
And it's from her point of view from 

2919
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:05,320
like Evan.
Yeah.

2920
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:07,180
See it.
You never see it.

2921
02:17:07,350 --> 02:17:09,310
Like you get it and it's implied.
It's very dark.

2922
02:17:09,670 --> 02:17:12,550
But like Ryan Gosling was supposed to be
that guy.

2923
02:17:13,070 --> 02:17:17,680
I'm like two teaching Stanley Tucci was 
the guy instead of director.

2924
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:19,470
But um,
Ryan,

2925
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:20,350
so Ryan,
I'm sorry,

2926
02:17:20,350 --> 02:17:23,380
the whole point is this was a,
this was the til and write it.

2927
02:17:23,381 --> 02:17:25,570
This was a today I learned or a movie 
details or one of those,

2928
02:17:25,810 --> 02:17:29,650
but like Ryan gosling gained literally 
30 to 50 pounds.

2929
02:17:29,651 --> 02:17:33,040
He never did the art.
They filmed it and Peter Jackson,

2930
02:17:33,041 --> 02:17:38,020
the director didn't like this guy.
Can you imagine seeing as I mentioned,

2931
02:17:38,021 --> 02:17:40,290
has a fucking actor.
You gained 30 to 50 pounds.

2932
02:17:40,310 --> 02:17:43,970
That's a shooting,
a youtube video times.

2933
02:17:48,070 --> 02:17:50,650
How can you imagine reshooting a fucking
attitude.

2934
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:54,290
I saw them shit.
I was like a fuck youtube video.

2935
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:58,660
It was just green screens fucking 
everywhere.

2936
02:17:58,661 --> 02:18:02,650
It was.
It was the scenes where they dumped the,

2937
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:07,890
where he dumps the body into the pit and
the creek or no,

2938
02:18:08,060 --> 02:18:11,960
there's like a big trash mold that they,
I know what you're talking about.

2939
02:18:11,961 --> 02:18:14,320
He dumps her in a box into the fucking 
thing.

2940
02:18:14,460 --> 02:18:15,293
Yeah.
I was there for those days and for the 

2941
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:20,260
neighborhood days where,
Oh sure.

2942
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:21,153
There's like,
like in the cul de sac of the 

2943
02:18:22,361 --> 02:18:25,960
neighborhood kind of shit.
It was like in Pennsylvania,

2944
02:18:26,130 --> 02:18:29,590
which is the weirdest thing.
I know.

2945
02:18:30,140 --> 02:18:31,750
I just get excited because I always 
forget.

2946
02:18:31,751 --> 02:18:33,280
You're like,
oh boy.

2947
02:18:33,380 --> 02:18:35,860
We were dashed place the film of fucking
lovely bones.

2948
02:18:35,890 --> 02:18:37,960
I love Philly.
I don't get why you don't love Philly.

2949
02:18:38,050 --> 02:18:41,020
That's always rubbed me wrong.
It's not that I don't love it,

2950
02:18:41,021 --> 02:18:42,370
it's that I'm done with it.

2951
02:18:44,230 --> 02:18:46,660
I mean it's a rough,
it's kind of a rough place in it.

2952
02:18:46,810 --> 02:18:48,640
That's the only place I've ever dare 
Rafi Duck.

2953
02:18:48,641 --> 02:18:52,180
It's in it.
If I get beat up somewhere,

2954
02:18:52,181 --> 02:18:53,020
I'm going to leave.
Yeah,

2955
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:55,590
you've been beat up in Philly.
Tell me what's the,

2956
02:18:55,630 --> 02:18:58,290
I think he told me you had a 
neighborhood kids that were like,

2957
02:19:00,130 --> 02:19:02,710
that sounds like a [inaudible].
I thought they were pipes,

2958
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:06,340
but while I was getting beat up upon you
and collection,

2959
02:19:06,850 --> 02:19:11,850
they were pieces of bicycle killed a 
bicyclist and and then Luna,

2960
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:16,210
his body,
like the fallout,

2961
02:19:16,211 --> 02:19:20,890
so like rebar and you were the bat 
flight pieces.

2962
02:19:22,210 --> 02:19:23,043
He used that to hit me a bunch of times 
right before I was about to move into 

2963
02:19:25,541 --> 02:19:26,201
this place.
And I was like,

2964
02:19:26,201 --> 02:19:27,034
all right,
I'm just going to move in there and I'm 

2965
02:19:27,921 --> 02:19:29,140
not going to do it.
No,

2966
02:19:29,150 --> 02:19:32,600
that's why you don't want some pipe 
wielding little punks.

2967
02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:33,160
Ah

2968
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:35,350
sucked.
You got to stay with us.

2969
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:37,280
Stay with us next time we go to Philly,
man.

2970
02:19:38,030 --> 02:19:39,800
Philly's a great,
well why do you go to Philly?

2971
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:40,370
Yeah,
I mean,

2972
02:19:40,370 --> 02:19:42,530
so my,
so Erin,

2973
02:19:42,531 --> 02:19:44,870
my wife is,
is from failure,

2974
02:19:44,890 --> 02:19:45,900
you know,
like sheet will,

2975
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:48,260
she's from a town just outside of Philly
by me.

2976
02:19:48,300 --> 02:19:49,133
Like she spent a lot,
she's lived in fit like in downtown 

2977
02:19:50,871 --> 02:19:54,530
Philly and um,
early on,

2978
02:19:54,531 --> 02:19:58,250
like romy just started dating in early 
2013.

2979
02:19:58,370 --> 02:19:59,203
Um,
I like lived with her in her apartment 

2980
02:20:02,631 --> 02:20:03,464
in Philly for a month and it goes,
but it was one of those things where 

2981
02:20:05,181 --> 02:20:06,940
like I was just kinda like hanging out 
with her for,

2982
02:20:06,980 --> 02:20:09,860
because she had come out to la to like 
visit me.

2983
02:20:09,861 --> 02:20:12,950
I hang out with me for a week.
So I returned the favor of the following

2984
02:20:12,950 --> 02:20:15,380
year in early 2013 to hang out with her 
in Philly.

2985
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:18,890
And it was just supposed to be a week 
and then a week turned into two weeks,

2986
02:20:18,891 --> 02:20:20,360
three weeks,
and then a whole month over month.

2987
02:20:20,760 --> 02:20:22,340
Um,
but it's just,

2988
02:20:22,341 --> 02:20:24,410
it's a hell of,
it's just such a fun,

2989
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:27,110
you walk everywhere,
unlike La,

2990
02:20:27,111 --> 02:20:29,600
you can't fucking walk anywhere in La 
unless you're in downtown,

2991
02:20:29,601 --> 02:20:33,260
but no ones in downtown.
You can walk anywhere in Philadelphia.

2992
02:20:33,290 --> 02:20:35,750
It's a very walkable city.
There's so much to do.

2993
02:20:35,751 --> 02:20:38,590
We went out to dinner just about every 
single,

2994
02:20:38,630 --> 02:20:40,730
like a different place every night 
because like,

2995
02:20:40,910 --> 02:20:42,560
it's just,
there's so much to do in Philly.

2996
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:45,170
Why doesn't seem to crossover with your 
anecdote?

2997
02:20:45,620 --> 02:20:46,251
Well,
I mean,

2998
02:20:46,251 --> 02:20:48,770
I have plenty of good things to say 
about Philadelphia,

2999
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:53,800
but they're all after I left,
none of them happened while I lived in a

3000
02:20:53,890 --> 02:20:55,970
damn shame area.
Uh,

3001
02:20:56,030 --> 02:20:58,400
you gotta you like La,
like we moved out of there.

3002
02:20:58,460 --> 02:21:01,700
My parents moved us out of Philly when I
was 12,

3003
02:21:02,270 --> 02:21:03,590
11,
something like that because,

3004
02:21:03,591 --> 02:21:04,424
uh,
I'm a gangster got shot outside of our 

3005
02:21:07,371 --> 02:21:10,370
house or a mobster.
That's terrifying.

3006
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:13,700
That's a Ma like Italian mafia.
You had a rough neighborhood?

3007
02:21:13,880 --> 02:21:15,290
No,
not at all.

3008
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:16,153
But there was FBI in some of the 
apartments that were like no shit 

3009
02:21:19,340 --> 02:21:21,800
watching us because at the end of our 
block,

3010
02:21:22,220 --> 02:21:23,053
um,
I grew up in at fifth and Katherine in 

3011
02:21:25,221 --> 02:21:28,860
Philadelphia and it was a,
uh,

3012
02:21:28,861 --> 02:21:33,090
a takeover of the mob scene at the time.
This Guy Joey Morlino.

3013
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:34,033
Hmm.

3014
02:21:34,130 --> 02:21:36,020
And this other guy,
Chink Illini,

3015
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:37,533
um,
and shingle Leni had an older brother 

3016
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:44,600
who was with the current heads of the,
of the mob.

3017
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:45,913
And so these,
these younger boys put out a hit on the 

3018
02:21:48,051 --> 02:21:49,970
older brother.
He got shot,

3019
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:50,953
went to a hospital.
The hospital was where my father worked 

3020
02:21:53,541 --> 02:21:54,374
at the time.
And these guys put the hit out from 

3021
02:21:57,380 --> 02:21:59,660
apparently the end of the block where I 
lived on.

3022
02:21:59,661 --> 02:22:02,210
So my dad's over here at this hospital.
They bring in Alenia.

3023
02:22:02,211 --> 02:22:04,100
It's always like we're mobsters in the 
hallway and shit.

3024
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:05,540
And then,
um,

3025
02:22:06,860 --> 02:22:07,693
meanwhile at my house,
my mom has somebody like a patient over 

3026
02:22:11,091 --> 02:22:15,140
that she's talking to.
And so in retaliation for the hit to put

3027
02:22:15,141 --> 02:22:19,820
that guy in the hospital,
they come over and just start firing at,

3028
02:22:20,010 --> 02:22:20,843
uh,
the guys at the end of the block who by 

3029
02:22:22,461 --> 02:22:24,380
the way,
it used to be a green piece.

3030
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:26,970
And then this,
uh,

3031
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,790
junior mafia took over and they turn it 
into an exterminators,

3032
02:22:30,450 --> 02:22:32,640
which is I think one of the funniest 
reversals,

3033
02:22:33,270 --> 02:22:35,730
I guess a classic comedy reversal right 
there.

3034
02:22:35,930 --> 02:22:37,890
But anyway,
they shot the shit out of these guys.

3035
02:22:37,891 --> 02:22:38,211
Jordan,
me,

3036
02:22:38,211 --> 02:22:42,840
Alina got shot in the ass.
A bunch of people died on your street.

3037
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:44,610
One person died,
uh,

3038
02:22:44,670 --> 02:22:49,530
I think it was tingling and his brother,
this younger guy died.

3039
02:22:49,890 --> 02:22:51,600
And then this is,
by the way,

3040
02:22:51,601 --> 02:22:55,050
I'm,
I'm not a wikipedia article for this,

3041
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:58,530
so if I'm wrong,
it doesn't make the whole thing wrong.

3042
02:22:58,790 --> 02:23:02,120
That just makes like that part wrong.
This escalate the shingle,

3043
02:23:02,121 --> 02:23:03,420
ng war.
No,

3044
02:23:03,421 --> 02:23:06,390
it was pretty much over it because it 
was just like,

3045
02:23:06,391 --> 02:23:07,224
what the fuck?
And then as far as like I was concerned 

3046
02:23:09,241 --> 02:23:11,480
or my family was concerned because,
uh,

3047
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:13,830
I think our house was already on the 
market when that happened.

3048
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:14,693
But once that happened,
it really put a fire under my parents 

3049
02:23:16,921 --> 02:23:17,754
asked to like,
get the fuck out of their trouble 

3050
02:23:20,371 --> 02:23:21,690
selling.
After that happened.

3051
02:23:21,930 --> 02:23:24,990
I doubt it because it was like,
now if you go to that neighborhood,

3052
02:23:24,991 --> 02:23:28,590
it's beautiful.
But at the time it was just these,

3053
02:23:29,220 --> 02:23:30,710
these fucking,
uh,

3054
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:33,540
got moocs.
Is that a word?

3055
02:23:33,810 --> 02:23:34,800
It is now,
man.

3056
02:23:34,830 --> 02:23:37,170
He's got Moocs,
silver on the end of the street.

3057
02:23:37,171 --> 02:23:41,040
It get the fucking exterminated.
They're the ones getting exterminated.

3058
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:42,713
I realized how I,
I don't think I realized how good 

3059
02:23:43,961 --> 02:23:46,260
fellows Merlino was in fucking prison 
right now.

3060
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:47,610
They found him as,
as,

3061
02:23:47,611 --> 02:23:50,070
as high profile as this guy was,
by the way.

3062
02:23:50,071 --> 02:23:52,200
He was like limping away with a bullet 
in his ass.

3063
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:53,393
And uh,
they found him under someone's bed when 

3064
02:23:55,231 --> 02:23:58,110
they were coming to arrest them.
And I remember that from the news.

3065
02:23:58,410 --> 02:24:02,310
They kicked someone's door and there was
this movie going to be right.

3066
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:03,713
I want to watch it.
Yeah.

3067
02:24:05,010 --> 02:24:07,590
I mean Lyngee Hey,
at least they didn't.

3068
02:24:07,591 --> 02:24:08,424
Fire volume gets more fun.
Glad they use bullets in that movie 

3069
02:24:13,291 --> 02:24:14,610
written.
From your perspective,

3070
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:15,833
my perspective would be like an eight 
year old comes home and they're loading 

3071
02:24:18,331 --> 02:24:21,180
a body into an ambulance and the eight 
year olds like,

3072
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:23,250
oh,
he's still got an Nintendo.

3073
02:24:24,050 --> 02:24:25,740
Don't care at all.
Yeah.

3074
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:30,000
It's like the worst movie ever.
What's that?

3075
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:31,050
Nothing.
Nothing.

3076
02:24:31,051 --> 02:24:34,860
Get the getting the fucking house right.
What does that looks like?

3077
02:24:34,861 --> 02:24:36,540
A dead body?
No,

3078
02:24:36,541 --> 02:24:37,021
no,
no,

3079
02:24:37,021 --> 02:24:37,580
no.
Again,

3080
02:24:37,580 --> 02:24:38,940
inside get inside,
we're having,

3081
02:24:39,390 --> 02:24:44,040
I'm always amazed looking back on my 
capacity to not give a fuck when I was a

3082
02:24:44,041 --> 02:24:44,750
kid.
Yeah.

3083
02:24:44,750 --> 02:24:47,220
Like no matter what awful thing was 
happening in the world,

3084
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:50,740
I just didn't care at all.
Well,

3085
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:52,080
you're a priority,
not,

3086
02:24:52,180 --> 02:24:53,570
yeah.
Your brain's wired.

3087
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:57,750
You know,
we've pretty much reached the end of our

3088
02:24:57,751 --> 02:24:58,584
document.
We've got reached the end of the 

3089
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:04,290
[inaudible].
Well,

3090
02:25:04,291 --> 02:25:07,470
we got got the pod.
You meant well,

3091
02:25:07,471 --> 02:25:09,270
we've got bacon.
Vending machine.

3092
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:10,380
Okay.
Okay.

3093
02:25:11,430 --> 02:25:14,260
We also have eric reacts to a Youtube 
rewind.

3094
02:25:14,270 --> 02:25:15,840
No,
I had a,

3095
02:25:15,841 --> 02:25:16,674
I had a pitch for you guys.
That's the rewind that I would love to 

3096
02:25:20,011 --> 02:25:24,370
just get a brief out there on.
Um,

3097
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:27,070
I was making sure that I wasn't getting 
a text message from my dad being like,

3098
02:25:27,071 --> 02:25:28,710
don't talk about that.
Oh,

3099
02:25:28,730 --> 02:25:30,970
nice.
Cause I remember the last time I was on,

3100
02:25:30,971 --> 02:25:33,050
he was like,
I remember that.

3101
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:34,753
Let's all check our phones.
Do we have notes from my notes from my 

3102
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:38,080
parents?
My parents,

3103
02:25:38,081 --> 02:25:40,840
usually they do have something to say 
every once in a while.

3104
02:25:41,170 --> 02:25:43,780
I have,
I don't have anything from your parents.

3105
02:25:43,781 --> 02:25:47,980
However,
I do have a quick summary of answers for

3106
02:25:47,981 --> 02:25:51,100
all of the furry questions we had 
earlier in the episode.

3107
02:25:51,910 --> 02:25:53,860
Yes.
Pooped.

3108
02:25:54,930 --> 02:25:56,740
Hell,
you better had fun at the park.

3109
02:25:56,741 --> 02:25:58,990
Were there about an hour?
Just returned from a walk.

3110
02:25:58,991 --> 02:26:00,910
Shredder pooped.
I'm trying to feed him now.

3111
02:26:00,940 --> 02:26:02,830
Do you guys use the APP?
That's really exciting.

3112
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,930
The Dog Walker.
My mom,

3113
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:07,630
I don't trust strange.
That's way better.

3114
02:26:07,660 --> 02:26:08,493
We love shutter.
Tell me about the firies if you would 

3115
02:26:11,021 --> 02:26:11,500
please.

3116
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:12,041
Okay.
So,

3117
02:26:12,041 --> 02:26:13,160
um,
uh,

3118
02:26:13,170 --> 02:26:17,440
a gentleman with a little furry avatar 
named Dan reached out.

3119
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:19,960
Yup.
Dan.

3120
02:26:20,050 --> 02:26:20,883
Uh,
just some real simple bullet pointed 

3121
02:26:23,141 --> 02:26:24,100
answers.
Here's furries.

3122
02:26:24,130 --> 02:26:25,630
Uh,
or like any fandom,

3123
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:26,913
the way I like to think about is 
basically saying that furries are all 

3124
02:26:28,811 --> 02:26:32,800
about sex is like saying everyone who 
watches anime like Hentai.

3125
02:26:32,801 --> 02:26:33,480
Okay,
hold on.

3126
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:35,440
Let me,
let me put a stop.

3127
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:41,040
First of all,
fandom of what furries sand them of you.

3128
02:26:46,510 --> 02:26:51,510
I think his point is just saying that 
it's a diverse,

3129
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:52,433
uh,
fandom there in that it's not a 

3130
02:26:53,501 --> 02:26:55,990
monolith.
There are different sex in it,

3131
02:26:55,991 --> 02:27:00,991
if you will.
So is being a furry putting on a suit?

3132
02:27:01,540 --> 02:27:03,490
Like where does,
because that seems like an extreme.

3133
02:27:03,491 --> 02:27:07,160
So where does furry is him start?
I think it's the light for a minute.

3134
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:10,930
I think the suit is a requirement.
I think that's kind of the baseline.

3135
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:13,060
That's,
that's an extreme.

3136
02:27:13,690 --> 02:27:14,523
That's not like watching anime,
that's getting an a suit and going 

3137
02:27:16,481 --> 02:27:18,100
meeting people.
Well,

3138
02:27:18,550 --> 02:27:19,280
hold on.
He,

3139
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:20,200
uh,
he addresses that.

3140
02:27:20,201 --> 02:27:21,580
So,
um,

3141
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:22,750
and again,
furry people,

3142
02:27:22,751 --> 02:27:23,710
I'm not,
I'm just,

3143
02:27:23,770 --> 02:27:25,980
I'm trying to understand.
Carry it.

3144
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:30,990
It's an unusual thing.
Three people I know and I,

3145
02:27:31,361 --> 02:27:33,630
and I don't want to be that guy.
You are,

3146
02:27:33,770 --> 02:27:38,770
but I do have a 250 Iq and I'm trying to
stress my massive intellect.

3147
02:27:39,940 --> 02:27:41,440
What's it like up there?
That view.

3148
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:42,670
So go ahead please.
Down.

3149
02:27:43,090 --> 02:27:43,923
Uh,
so he says he does agree many fursuits 

3150
02:27:46,390 --> 02:27:50,830
of specially the faces and eyes are 
definitely kind of creepy or off in some

3151
02:27:50,831 --> 02:27:51,664
way,
but they're super expensive and the 

3152
02:27:53,651 --> 02:27:56,200
nicer they are the price here.
Um,

3153
02:27:56,201 --> 02:27:57,910
so I guess he's saying,
you know,

3154
02:27:57,911 --> 02:27:59,440
the cheap ones are going to look 
creepier.

3155
02:27:59,910 --> 02:28:03,100
I think it's just an uncanny thing cause
it's like a Fox humanoid,

3156
02:28:03,160 --> 02:28:07,110
Eh got pleased Dan,
if you could put if you yeah,

3157
02:28:07,310 --> 02:28:08,200
sure.
And so,

3158
02:28:08,201 --> 02:28:09,820
uh,
he says on that note,

3159
02:28:09,821 --> 02:28:11,950
since they're so expensive and hard to 
clean,

3160
02:28:11,951 --> 02:28:13,430
most people who own them,
we don't,

3161
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:15,410
kids may not have sex in them,
right?

3162
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:16,293
There are even some drama in the past 
where people were saying that those who 

3163
02:28:19,331 --> 02:28:21,860
do have sex in their suits shouldn't 
them in public.

3164
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:24,590
Uh,
but who knows how that argument ended.

3165
02:28:24,650 --> 02:28:26,480
So a Mongol,
how many,

3166
02:28:27,820 --> 02:28:28,653
so how many fandoms are there arguments 
amongst themselves about wearing their 

3167
02:28:34,251 --> 02:28:36,290
suits,
having sex in their suits?

3168
02:28:36,470 --> 02:28:41,270
Like it's clearly a part of,
it's definitely an aspect that she's not

3169
02:28:41,271 --> 02:28:43,760
denying that comes suit.
I would want to come,

3170
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:46,100
it's a come spent all this money on a 
suit.

3171
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:48,340
I'm going to just go over.
Well,

3172
02:28:48,350 --> 02:28:49,820
you're a funny,
do you want to mark your territory?

3173
02:28:49,880 --> 02:28:50,450
Sorry,
go ahead.

3174
02:28:50,450 --> 02:28:54,200
I think the animate comparison is apt in
that he's saying,

3175
02:28:54,230 --> 02:28:56,330
you know,
like myself,

3176
02:28:56,331 --> 02:28:57,164
you know,
I enjoy anime but I'm not into the 

3177
02:28:58,491 --> 02:29:00,980
Hentai aspect of it,
which is sort of like,

3178
02:29:00,981 --> 02:29:03,630
it's a subculture within a subculture.
Okay.

3179
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:07,550
The people that are that it's super 
sexual for within the furry community.

3180
02:29:07,730 --> 02:29:10,070
That's just one section.
Okay.

3181
02:29:10,910 --> 02:29:12,230
Okay.
And so,

3182
02:29:12,231 --> 02:29:13,780
uh,
and then he says a bad dream.

3183
02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:15,343
This is a different person also talks 
about bad dragon is basically a website 

3184
02:29:18,081 --> 02:29:21,110
that makes weird sex toys more,
mostly marketed towards furries.

3185
02:29:21,380 --> 02:29:24,650
Those wearable things are basically like
a dildo that goes around your deck.

3186
02:29:24,710 --> 02:29:26,690
So there you go.
So you don't get any,

3187
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:28,490
well,
you don't get any physical,

3188
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:29,593
well I guess the person wearing it 
doesn't cause the debt is way fucking 

3189
02:29:32,601 --> 02:29:35,990
nicer than your own others.
He can get electrodes.

3190
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:39,770
Does it just give you,
well yeah,

3191
02:29:39,771 --> 02:29:43,180
I've got a guy,
I got a prop deck that it's show,

3192
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:45,230
it looks like a creature from shape of 
water.

3193
02:29:45,380 --> 02:29:46,680
Oh sure.
Awesome.

3194
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:48,440
Fantastic.
I just,

3195
02:29:48,441 --> 02:29:51,680
I just shocked at myself in the deck 
with it on and film it for fiber.

3196
02:29:53,380 --> 02:29:55,820
They don't,
I interestingly,

3197
02:29:55,821 --> 02:29:56,654
uh,
I've killed a couple people with it and 

3198
02:29:59,511 --> 02:30:00,344
so the bad dragon is a,
is a penis modification that looks at 

3199
02:30:03,921 --> 02:30:04,850
like an animals.

3200
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:05,660
Well,
bad dragon,

3201
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:09,110
I guess it's just a website.
Not a website is sold.

3202
02:30:09,111 --> 02:30:12,770
Various different antibiotic.
I have a good check it out of your own.

3203
02:30:12,771 --> 02:30:15,990
Tiny little pathetic human penis.
But for those of you at home,

3204
02:30:16,040 --> 02:30:18,380
the bad dragon.com,
Pakistan will love that.

3205
02:30:18,710 --> 02:30:19,340
And then,
uh,

3206
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:20,173
his final point here is that not 
everyone who likes furries really buys 

3207
02:30:23,571 --> 02:30:26,390
into the fandom.
Some people really live it like with any

3208
02:30:26,391 --> 02:30:27,224
fandom,
but some people just like it and don't 

3209
02:30:28,581 --> 02:30:30,260
really go to conventions.
What do that?

3210
02:30:30,680 --> 02:30:31,513
I just,
what are they fans of dressing up is 

3211
02:30:32,961 --> 02:30:34,290
animals.
I mean,

3212
02:30:35,330 --> 02:30:36,440
cosplay,
cosplay,

3213
02:30:38,270 --> 02:30:39,350
cosplay,
cosplay.

3214
02:30:39,470 --> 02:30:40,303
But it was play.
What I'm missing is I feel like there's 

3215
02:30:42,111 --> 02:30:42,944
an Oregon cozy play.
I feel like there's an origin to this 

3216
02:30:46,431 --> 02:30:48,970
that we're not understanding.
I got your point.

3217
02:30:48,990 --> 02:30:50,420
Yeah.
What's the origin?

3218
02:30:50,421 --> 02:30:53,110
Where does it come from?
There's got to be cosplaying.

3219
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:57,140
Like how did people decide that they 
loved dressing up like foxes?

3220
02:30:57,260 --> 02:31:00,950
Like what's the origin?
There's got to be a show or a TV.

3221
02:31:02,660 --> 02:31:06,410
Music.
Yeah.

3222
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:07,373
Yeah.
What's the first piece of entertainment 

3223
02:31:09,171 --> 02:31:14,090
where the main character was an 
anthropomorphic animal?

3224
02:31:14,091 --> 02:31:15,530
Fox.
Felix the cat.

3225
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:18,470
It was a winnie the Pooh and just him 
walking around without no pants.

3226
02:31:18,590 --> 02:31:19,980
Mickey had a lot of people were like,

3227
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:20,813
Yo,

3228
02:31:20,910 --> 02:31:23,590
I want to know the origin.
That's the big next too.

3229
02:31:23,591 --> 02:31:25,400
Because uh,
you know,

3230
02:31:25,450 --> 02:31:27,640
the,
the furry thing,

3231
02:31:27,641 --> 02:31:30,310
it's all animals,
but like it seems,

3232
02:31:30,350 --> 02:31:32,790
and I could be wrong about this,
but it seems like 80% of that,

3233
02:31:32,810 --> 02:31:33,780
it's all foxes.
Yeah.

3234
02:31:33,810 --> 02:31:36,640
It's all foxes.
So there's something going on there.

3235
02:31:36,670 --> 02:31:41,110
We'll foxes are sexy.
One of the sexier animals.

3236
02:31:41,111 --> 02:31:41,441
Yeah.
Yeah.

3237
02:31:41,441 --> 02:31:42,550
You know,
like a,

3238
02:31:42,551 --> 02:31:43,930
you look at the,

3239
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:44,710
Oh,
do it.

3240
02:31:44,710 --> 02:31:46,730
You look at a Fox and try not to get 
horny.

3241
02:31:47,420 --> 02:31:50,690
What's the sexiest Fox though?
I'm the one from the Fox and the hound.

3242
02:31:50,691 --> 02:31:52,070
Right.
What am I thinking of?

3243
02:31:52,280 --> 02:31:53,113
Disney?

3244
02:31:54,050 --> 02:31:54,883
Yeah.

3245
02:31:54,980 --> 02:31:57,650
What Fox mccloud from smash.
I don't think I've seen that.

3246
02:31:58,350 --> 02:32:00,960
That's like one of those old,
like from the 60s animated.

3247
02:32:00,961 --> 02:32:03,150
I'm classics of Disney.
The Fox and the hound.

3248
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:03,691
No,
I'm,

3249
02:32:03,691 --> 02:32:04,370
well I'm more of

3250
02:32:04,370 --> 02:32:06,920
the uh,

3251
02:32:07,010 --> 02:32:09,630
tramp and lady and the lady.
Yeah.

3252
02:32:09,631 --> 02:32:10,464
More of a,
I don't think there are any foxes in 

3253
02:32:11,491 --> 02:32:12,324
that movie.

3254
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:16,110
I would come on the trip.
We know the,

3255
02:32:16,150 --> 02:32:18,600
the tramp would,
is that not a dry,

3256
02:32:18,601 --> 02:32:22,170
I'd have to get him back to like a skank

3257
02:32:22,240 --> 02:32:24,610
it.
So it used to mean something different.

3258
02:32:24,611 --> 02:32:25,151
So,
so,

3259
02:32:25,151 --> 02:32:25,984
so,
um,

3260
02:32:26,110 --> 02:32:26,943
uh,
Charlie Chaplin played the lovable 

3261
02:32:30,190 --> 02:32:31,023
tramp.
Like his character was a tramp and it 

3262
02:32:32,891 --> 02:32:36,250
was just kind of like a,
it meant something different back in the

3263
02:32:36,250 --> 02:32:37,330
day.
When I sit back in the day,

3264
02:32:37,331 --> 02:32:40,000
I mean like in the fucking 20s,
30s,

3265
02:32:40,001 --> 02:32:42,190
I apologize if that's not quite the 
right timeline,

3266
02:32:42,191 --> 02:32:42,700
but,
um,

3267
02:32:42,700 --> 02:32:43,750
it,
it used to mean something.

3268
02:32:43,751 --> 02:32:47,080
So lady and the tramp did not mean like,
cause it was lady,

3269
02:32:47,410 --> 02:32:49,990
the lady dog.
And then tramp was like this homeless,

3270
02:32:49,991 --> 02:32:52,360
kind of like a vagabond and little guy.
Yeah,

3271
02:32:52,370 --> 02:32:53,390
yeah,
yeah,

3272
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:55,240
yeah.
And so it meant something different.

3273
02:32:55,241 --> 02:32:57,080
So today in today's standard,
you know,

3274
02:32:57,100 --> 02:32:57,933
tramp stamp,
that's obviously a derogatory term for 

3275
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:00,930
that.

3276
02:33:00,930 --> 02:33:01,763
Oh,
is he making a movie called like lady 

3277
02:33:03,031 --> 02:33:07,070
and the Skank skanking a bottle.
Yeah.

3278
02:33:07,650 --> 02:33:08,483
Going to be there next CGI,
a live action remake after Aladdin and 

3279
02:33:10,921 --> 02:33:11,754
after Milan

3280
02:33:11,970 --> 02:33:14,340
after I got to know what's,
what the fuck?

3281
02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:18,480
Oh ilos I'll look it very,
I mean,

3282
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:19,433
you can look it up easily.
The furry fandom is a subculture 

3283
02:33:22,081 --> 02:33:27,081
interested in and throw poor morphic 
animal characters.

3284
02:33:27,241 --> 02:33:29,700
We'd human personalities and 
characteristics.

3285
02:33:30,530 --> 02:33:31,650
But why Laos?
Fox Is,

3286
02:33:31,651 --> 02:33:36,590
you're right Dan.
They're all Fox and there's two,

3287
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:39,020
but mostly Fox.
The Fox thing seems to,

3288
02:33:39,110 --> 02:33:41,700
that's the number one rate boxes is 
sexy.

3289
02:33:44,650 --> 02:33:46,630
Blame for frame here.
All right,

3290
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:51,030
let's see what we've got.
We've got all of the good stuff.

3291
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:52,710
We never,
we never did watch the,

3292
02:33:52,711 --> 02:33:53,490
uh,
the married,

3293
02:33:53,490 --> 02:33:55,500
that married twins.
Fuck the skanks.

3294
02:33:55,501 --> 02:33:57,220
I want to pitch something.
You cramps.

3295
02:33:57,530 --> 02:33:59,910
She's tramps.
They can go kick rocks.

3296
02:34:00,900 --> 02:34:05,400
I mean either vetoing this.
Do you think that's a dangerous watch?

3297
02:34:05,460 --> 02:34:07,350
No,
I'm just saying it doesn't go anywhere.

3298
02:34:07,351 --> 02:34:09,870
There's no,
it's just that I'm talking about you.

3299
02:34:10,110 --> 02:34:13,050
You think they do and there's a lot of 
crow.

3300
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:15,030
Do you know that lot?
There's a lot of,

3301
02:34:15,110 --> 02:34:15,943
uh,
religious girls who don't have sex 

3302
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:18,400
because it's forbidden

3303
02:34:18,490 --> 02:34:19,690
until they get married.
But they,

3304
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:20,820
they take it up.
The Bot.

3305
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:24,640
If you guys heard about the animals 
really soaking,

3306
02:34:24,820 --> 02:34:27,940
what does that mean?
That is a mormon thing.

3307
02:34:27,941 --> 02:34:31,660
Where before you're allowed to actually 
have sex,

3308
02:34:31,990 --> 02:34:34,720
you can insert,
but just leave it there.

3309
02:34:35,890 --> 02:34:38,920
You can't go in and out and away.
It's soaking wet.

3310
02:34:38,921 --> 02:34:40,990
You mean the penis?
Google.

3311
02:34:40,991 --> 02:34:44,020
Mormon Solo.
Are you talking about a penis or a toy?

3312
02:34:44,050 --> 02:34:48,640
Penis or allow his penis in the vagina.
But as long as you don't move,

3313
02:34:48,641 --> 02:34:51,280
it's all dogs.
You don't move fast.

3314
02:34:51,281 --> 02:34:53,840
One on God.
Yeah,

3315
02:34:53,870 --> 02:34:55,060
I'm into that.
No,

3316
02:34:55,140 --> 02:34:56,230
no.
That's a shortcut.

3317
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:59,410
Stoke Google that Google is soaking you 
get,

3318
02:35:00,010 --> 02:35:03,040
first of all,
there's no way that you can soak and not

3319
02:35:03,250 --> 02:35:05,320
end up fucking,
so there's,

3320
02:35:05,710 --> 02:35:07,770
there is games called fear of God.
No,

3321
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:09,610
no.
You guys know just a tip.

3322
02:35:10,090 --> 02:35:10,900
Yes.
Yeah.

3323
02:35:10,900 --> 02:35:11,733
Just a tip.

3324
02:35:11,740 --> 02:35:12,573
Never ever ends with the guy not coming.
Like just the tip is always like the 

3325
02:35:15,791 --> 02:35:16,690
guy.
He's like,

3326
02:35:16,691 --> 02:35:17,440
hey,
hey baby.

3327
02:35:17,440 --> 02:35:18,310
You want it?
Like just a tip.

3328
02:35:18,700 --> 02:35:19,600
And then they like,
you know,

3329
02:35:19,601 --> 02:35:20,700
he's like,
but he's like us.

3330
02:35:20,701 --> 02:35:25,170
The tip I usually just 20% doing.
Anyway,

3331
02:35:25,220 --> 02:35:30,090
my Dick,
let's give a good pit now.

3332
02:35:30,930 --> 02:35:34,810
Right now,
I wish we were watching that video.

3333
02:35:35,050 --> 02:35:35,883
I wish I was downhill.
That was the most entertaining video of 

3334
02:35:39,161 --> 02:35:41,270
tonight.
I will say,

3335
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:44,240
God,
I hope he's a new smash plc.

3336
02:35:44,490 --> 02:35:46,930
We're getting five new characters in 
2019 pd.

3337
02:35:46,950 --> 02:35:48,760
Parotid plant is,
the number of characters are,

3338
02:35:48,761 --> 02:35:50,920
they're like on Munch unlaunched.
There's like,

3339
02:35:51,010 --> 02:35:53,200
Oh,
you only get 70 70 I think,

3340
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:54,760
or something like that.
You have to unlock.

3341
02:35:55,540 --> 02:35:58,340
You only get home.
You get when you like.

3342
02:35:58,960 --> 02:36:01,230
Oh gotcha.
Oh,

3343
02:36:01,370 --> 02:36:02,203
okay.
Okay.

3344
02:36:02,590 --> 02:36:03,870
And you have to unlock the rest of it.

3345
02:36:04,180 --> 02:36:05,013
In total at launch there are over 70 
there's like 74 that's going to be like 

3346
02:36:07,750 --> 02:36:10,740
a hundred and fucking 50 by the end of 
2019 well,

3347
02:36:10,750 --> 02:36:13,810
let's pray that fill that bag up.
Makes the cut.

3348
02:36:14,440 --> 02:36:18,130
That would be a lawnmower.
W what's the subreddit for the for that,

3349
02:36:18,131 --> 02:36:18,964
because I'm going to have to filter it 
out because I don't want to see a god 

3350
02:36:21,381 --> 02:36:23,860
damn announcement for a new character 
every two weeks.

3351
02:36:24,290 --> 02:36:25,123
Well,
you,

3352
02:36:25,230 --> 02:36:26,620
well,
you're not seeing it.

3353
02:36:26,621 --> 02:36:27,960
You ain't got a problem.
All right.

3354
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:30,880
Right.
It's just a hat.

3355
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:31,773
You got up.
You wouldn't be excited for hat new 

3356
02:36:33,641 --> 02:36:35,050
challenger.
Right,

3357
02:36:35,051 --> 02:36:35,710
right,
right.

3358
02:36:35,710 --> 02:36:40,710
Newt Gingrich.
That'd be fucking Newt Gingrich.

3359
02:36:40,961 --> 02:36:42,670
Fat Fingers,
Melodies Berg.

3360
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:45,280
He's really trying to get in with the 
kids.

3361
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:46,840
Yeah,
because that's what gets me,

3362
02:36:46,841 --> 02:36:48,730
right.
I guess.

3363
02:36:48,731 --> 02:36:50,250
Let's wrap it up.
It's been,

3364
02:36:50,620 --> 02:36:51,453
sorry,
it's been $1 million idea for spent 

3365
02:36:52,410 --> 02:36:54,800
almost three hours,
but I'll pick this pick.

3366
02:36:54,820 --> 02:36:55,840
Let's,
let's make it the three.

3367
02:36:56,370 --> 02:36:57,203
I'm very excited about this.
So you guys were talking about the 

3368
02:36:59,561 --> 02:37:02,740
youtube rewind.
I don't give a shit about that.

3369
02:37:03,130 --> 02:37:04,330
Right,
the rewind itself,

3370
02:37:04,750 --> 02:37:09,000
but next year I really want to see an h 
three wind,

3371
02:37:09,230 --> 02:37:10,063
h three one where you hit up.
All your friends were to me saying they 

3372
02:37:12,851 --> 02:37:14,770
make the video that everybody wanted to 
see.

3373
02:37:14,910 --> 02:37:16,010
Why Youtube got to make

3374
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:18,800
the video.
I don't think I'm the guy for that.

3375
02:37:18,890 --> 02:37:23,860
I eat or on the pulse.
You got,

3376
02:37:23,930 --> 02:37:27,350
you got people to help you out.
You got people coordinated.

3377
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:31,100
Rewind h three wine.
The name is kind of too good to pass on.

3378
02:37:31,230 --> 02:37:32,063
That is a good idea.
It should be like everyone who slipped 

3379
02:37:33,861 --> 02:37:34,694
up and said the n word.
I'll happily say the outward getting 

3380
02:37:39,501 --> 02:37:43,290
that video on make it ends in a,
I'll do a quick roll.

3381
02:37:43,310 --> 02:37:48,310
Instagram and pie by Edward compilation 
h three one and work on page three wine.

3382
02:37:50,270 --> 02:37:51,103
I just,
I'm just saying I want to put it out 

3383
02:37:53,031 --> 02:37:55,010
there.
Think about it.

3384
02:37:55,070 --> 02:37:55,903
Jack.
Looks like he wants to make that n word 

3385
02:37:56,721 --> 02:37:59,450
cut right now.
I'll talk.

3386
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:02,300
I'll talk.
Let's wrap.

3387
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:04,890
I'm sober Dan.
No,

3388
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:07,993
I think that's a great idea.
Each three wine 2019 youtube can make 

3389
02:38:11,541 --> 02:38:12,374
whatever they want.
They're going to make something weird 

3390
02:38:15,320 --> 02:38:16,153
that's a really good hitters to a 
certain demographic that they're happy 

3391
02:38:18,711 --> 02:38:20,950
about.
Just everyone the same date.

3392
02:38:21,770 --> 02:38:22,610
I think so,
yeah.

3393
02:38:24,650 --> 02:38:26,240
When it comes out,
yeah,

3394
02:38:26,241 --> 02:38:27,440
I didn't,
but I think there,

3395
02:38:27,441 --> 02:38:29,750
there's gotta be some method to the 
madness.

3396
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:30,673
Here's my reason for wanting this is 
that like so many people seem to give a 

3397
02:38:33,861 --> 02:38:34,694
shit,
right?

3398
02:38:35,020 --> 02:38:36,290
Yeah.
Why do you,

3399
02:38:36,350 --> 02:38:40,520
why do you honestly fucking care what 
this website makes?

3400
02:38:40,550 --> 02:38:42,560
I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you exactly why.

3401
02:38:44,930 --> 02:38:47,280
Because it affects us all.
I Eric.

3402
02:38:47,290 --> 02:38:48,123
Okay.
It affects,

3403
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:51,070
and if it looks bad,
one,

3404
02:38:51,410 --> 02:38:55,510
it looks bad to all of us.
It's a lot of like,

3405
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:57,390
was it like 10 million dislikes or 
whatever.

3406
02:38:57,391 --> 02:38:58,224
It turned into a meme.
Really let them make whatever the hell 

3407
02:39:02,841 --> 02:39:05,420
they want.
But I think the,

3408
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:07,010
it's hard not to care.
I don't know why.

3409
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:07,913
It's just the burden of making a good 
one should not be on them because 

3410
02:39:11,960 --> 02:39:14,060
clearly they're not in the only thing.
They dropped the ball.

3411
02:39:14,200 --> 02:39:17,330
The burden of making it go and she'd be 
on it requires a lot of resources,

3412
02:39:17,331 --> 02:39:19,220
a lot of coordinating that you can do.

3413
02:39:19,220 --> 02:39:22,280
I can't get like I can't get,
you can do it year round,

3414
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:25,760
year round.
Anytime you get a guest on the podcast,

3415
02:39:25,970 --> 02:39:26,950
get there,
you know?

3416
02:39:27,700 --> 02:39:30,900
No,
I'm going to veto that.

3417
02:39:31,400 --> 02:39:34,280
It's gotta be at the end of the year.
I'm sorry.

3418
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:35,233
Like I see what you're going,
but it's gotta be like a lot of annual 

3419
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:40,580
thing I think to me,
I just,

3420
02:39:40,670 --> 02:39:41,540
you know,
I don't,

3421
02:39:41,690 --> 02:39:43,070
it's a lot of responsibility,
Eric,

3422
02:39:43,490 --> 02:39:46,160
and I'm really stressed out already just
thinking about it.

3423
02:39:46,161 --> 02:39:49,610
I guarantee,
I mean,

3424
02:39:49,611 --> 02:39:50,444
I'm not,
I'm not to say all be all or anything 

3425
02:39:53,211 --> 02:39:57,020
like that,
but a go,

3426
02:39:57,050 --> 02:39:59,660
let's make a poll.
Oh,

3427
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:01,370
I was going to say,
yeah,

3428
02:40:01,610 --> 02:40:04,940
well yeah.
[inaudible] you make the rewind.

3429
02:40:04,941 --> 02:40:06,090
Let's take a poll.
All right.

3430
02:40:06,530 --> 02:40:11,530
But I don't have a catchy name for it.
It's the,

3431
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:13,830
the,
it's the youtube,

3432
02:40:14,490 --> 02:40:18,150
the h three wind right off the tongue.
It really does.

3433
02:40:18,210 --> 02:40:20,090
It really does.
Ace three threes,

3434
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:22,750
even like a backwards z.
We're going to think of one.

3435
02:40:22,751 --> 02:40:27,480
If it's the he whined the he wine baby,
do the h three one.

3436
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:30,430
I wish I could if I wish I could be 
wine.

3437
02:40:32,170 --> 02:40:32,941
Yeah.
What would yours be,

3438
02:40:32,941 --> 02:40:34,590
Eric?
Uh,

3439
02:40:34,650 --> 02:40:35,483
it would start with will smith Gallia 
I'd be like a really poorly done g 

3440
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:46,200
version of him.
And then it melts into a puddle and then

3441
02:40:46,201 --> 02:40:47,034
in the puddle you see the planet Nibiru 
coming around the sun and then it soaks 

3442
02:40:51,301 --> 02:40:54,390
up all the oceans of earth of this.
This is you.

3443
02:40:54,400 --> 02:40:56,430
This is totally off the cuff.
And then,

3444
02:40:56,460 --> 02:40:58,650
and then what happens is,
is uh,

3445
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:04,230
Steve Bannon is riding one of those 
waves up towards the sun and he turns to

3446
02:41:04,231 --> 02:41:08,130
the camera and he says something 
incredibly hateful but poignant.

3447
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:09,893
Everyone agrees with,
he just drops the animal with a hardy 

3448
02:41:11,770 --> 02:41:13,800
are low and,
and,

3449
02:41:13,801 --> 02:41:14,634
and purposeful.
And then like a check get shot at him 

3450
02:41:16,891 --> 02:41:17,724
and he catches it right before it kills 
him and he slowly and search it and his 

3451
02:41:23,791 --> 02:41:25,530
ass.
And you see it close up.

3452
02:41:25,590 --> 02:41:28,370
You see it?
Yeah.

3453
02:41:29,610 --> 02:41:34,610
I'm just saying that 20,
19 you guys three hours.

3454
02:41:35,190 --> 02:41:38,580
And then Susan comes out and says,
now that's a rewind.

3455
02:41:40,410 --> 02:41:43,120
You hire those two women from earlier.
Yeah,

3456
02:41:43,790 --> 02:41:46,560
that's a really wide,
oh fuck,

3457
02:41:46,570 --> 02:41:49,300
oh no.
God Damn Greater.

3458
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:51,190
Then just cut it off.
Yeah.

3459
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:53,460
Yeah.
Dan at Dan's been texting me,

3460
02:41:53,461 --> 02:41:54,294
by the way.
He's been hitting me up on our little 

3461
02:41:56,370 --> 02:41:59,130
office cat that will wrap it up.
He goes,

3462
02:41:59,131 --> 02:42:01,870
let's wrap it up.
He keeps blood up.

3463
02:42:01,950 --> 02:42:03,560
Well,
where's all ship?

3464
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:07,530
Our Life?
We're getting Henny,

3465
02:42:07,531 --> 02:42:09,390
right.
Hashtag h street wind,

3466
02:42:09,420 --> 02:42:14,420
everybody spamming shadow.
There'll be forced to.

3467
02:42:16,710 --> 02:42:19,050
There's really no choice here.
Do you think will smith?

3468
02:42:19,051 --> 02:42:19,884
We'll do a rewind for me.
I think it might as well just give me 

3469
02:42:21,721 --> 02:42:22,820
one of these.
Ah,

3470
02:42:27,150 --> 02:42:32,150
do you notice that he does not notice 
that?

3471
02:42:39,060 --> 02:42:39,893
I don't know if that was

3472
02:42:43,170 --> 02:42:44,003
you're describing it as that.
I don't know if that's entirely 

3473
02:42:45,921 --> 02:42:46,880
insensitive.
Thanks.

3474
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:47,953
No thanks.
So I think I don't even know where 

3475
02:42:49,971 --> 02:42:51,590
you're talking about.
Well he does.

3476
02:42:51,620 --> 02:42:53,070
He goes like,
ah,

3477
02:42:53,770 --> 02:42:54,603
no.
I think it was like,

3478
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:57,080
I think it was like a um,
uh,

3479
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:58,920
R and b hip hop,
like old school rba.

3480
02:42:58,950 --> 02:43:01,850
Nobody's trying so hard not to act 
because I,

3481
02:43:01,851 --> 02:43:03,980
like I said,
this is the,

3482
02:43:04,310 --> 02:43:09,170
this is the performance of his career 
because nobody has had to try to pretend

3483
02:43:09,171 --> 02:43:12,270
to like fortnight and youtube much as 
will smith has.

3484
02:43:12,820 --> 02:43:17,570
His opening line is I want fortnight and
Mark Keys Brown.

3485
02:43:18,610 --> 02:43:19,443
So you do know,
you do know where you want to fucking 

3486
02:43:20,811 --> 02:43:21,340
lie.
Yeah.

3487
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:25,400
Watch the first 45 years and then I 
just,

3488
02:43:26,960 --> 02:43:30,670
the by the way they promote it.
It's like everywhere.

3489
02:43:30,730 --> 02:43:32,500
Oh,
they lie.

3490
02:43:33,480 --> 02:43:34,313
They cheat.
They're,

3491
02:43:35,170 --> 02:43:36,510
you know,
they shut that shit with mark.

3492
02:43:36,511 --> 02:43:37,344
He's Brown in the bus before the got 
will smith because he just looks into 

3493
02:43:40,541 --> 02:43:42,520
the camera and he's like,
is this what you wanted?

3494
02:43:42,680 --> 02:43:43,840
Yeah.
It's all you can think about is like,

3495
02:43:43,841 --> 02:43:45,070
all right,
whoever we get,

3496
02:43:45,430 --> 02:43:49,430
you're going to say I want fortnight and
Tana,

3497
02:43:50,270 --> 02:43:51,340
Mohan Gill,
right?

3498
02:44:00,140 --> 02:44:04,620
Ah,
I don't know.

3499
02:44:04,621 --> 02:44:06,970
Well,
I just don't know about this one.

3500
02:44:08,770 --> 02:44:09,520
Ah,

3501
02:44:09,520 --> 02:44:14,520
he directed or you on is where you are 
on time.

3502
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,890
It's almost like a goat who sounds like 
a man.

3503
02:44:17,900 --> 02:44:19,310
So how do I know that?
Yeah,

3504
02:44:19,311 --> 02:44:20,030
yeah.
Yeah.

3505
02:44:20,030 --> 02:44:23,240
You think he's mad that they didn't give
him like proper direction?

3506
02:44:23,450 --> 02:44:24,283
Like No.
Like do you think he had final approval 

3507
02:44:26,211 --> 02:44:28,160
over this or did he stop in the release 
right away?

3508
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:29,610
Well Smith probably fucking

3509
02:44:30,250 --> 02:44:31,083
did.
He probably,

3510
02:44:31,510 --> 02:44:32,980
cause if I was bill Smith I would be 
like,

3511
02:44:33,010 --> 02:44:34,390
we got it.
We should be part of it.

3512
02:44:34,420 --> 02:44:36,790
I think he's legit happy to be a part of
rewind because like he,

3513
02:44:36,791 --> 02:44:37,624
I checked this channel out and he is 
like legit trying to delve into the 

3514
02:44:41,561 --> 02:44:45,400
youtube world.
And I think like just any involvement,

3515
02:44:45,460 --> 02:44:49,360
I mean that any involvement in rewind,
he is very happy to get,

3516
02:44:49,480 --> 02:44:51,700
I agree.
Like he's in his,

3517
02:44:51,701 --> 02:44:53,530
in his um,
channel trailer.

3518
02:44:53,531 --> 02:44:55,660
He says like you two has reinvigorated 
me.

3519
02:44:55,661 --> 02:44:58,990
It's getting to light and to be fair I 
think that's fucking cool.

3520
02:44:59,020 --> 02:45:00,310
Like I mean,
yeah,

3521
02:45:00,311 --> 02:45:01,600
one hand it's like,
ah,

3522
02:45:01,601 --> 02:45:03,170
it's an alias,
a triple a list,

3523
02:45:03,790 --> 02:45:05,890
Hollywood star getting into youtube.
But on the other hand,

3524
02:45:05,891 --> 02:45:09,310
like if it gets him excited,
like I can't fault them for that because

3525
02:45:09,370 --> 02:45:13,010
they don't put an ad for sal allergy.
I'm cool.

3526
02:45:13,080 --> 02:45:14,800
Exactly.
Exactly.

3527
02:45:16,790 --> 02:45:20,820
Oh dianetics Yah.
I'm raising my kids in a cryo chamber.

3528
02:45:20,940 --> 02:45:21,773
God Damn,
I don't have a problem with them being 

3529
02:45:24,360 --> 02:45:25,880
on Youtube.
Yeah.

3530
02:45:26,220 --> 02:45:27,810
At all.
I mean for us,

3531
02:45:27,900 --> 02:45:28,501
of course.
Yeah.

3532
02:45:28,501 --> 02:45:30,660
But like,
like man shit,

3533
02:45:30,710 --> 02:45:32,520
what was it last year?
Was it the rock?

3534
02:45:32,570 --> 02:45:34,650
It was the wrong one or two years ago 
was the rock.

3535
02:45:34,651 --> 02:45:36,180
I forget which one.
Like he opens a fan.

3536
02:45:36,760 --> 02:45:37,593
How active is the rock on Youtube now?
Like that was a good batting fucking 

3537
02:45:42,720 --> 02:45:44,670
passwords.
A youth to fully supports.

3538
02:45:45,270 --> 02:45:46,120
He never knew.
Right,

3539
02:45:46,270 --> 02:45:47,310
right.
He never knew it.

3540
02:45:47,311 --> 02:45:48,144
Yeah,
of course that,

3541
02:45:48,420 --> 02:45:53,060
but like we'll rewind,
I would want fortnight.

3542
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:56,220
I also the premise of this video,
so exactly.

3543
02:45:56,221 --> 02:45:58,290
That's a DAB bubble moment.
Absolutely.

3544
02:45:58,470 --> 02:46:02,310
But the premise is like that will smith 
is in charge of rewind.

3545
02:46:02,610 --> 02:46:05,070
It's like it's all you baby.
You're the one,

3546
02:46:05,100 --> 02:46:05,821
you're neil.
Yeah.

3547
02:46:05,821 --> 02:46:07,840
That wasn't the best year to make it.
Yeah.

3548
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:11,330
It's like whoever watches,
well I'm charged for rewind.

3549
02:46:11,580 --> 02:46:13,370
Yeah.
And it's like a fucking fever dream.

3550
02:46:13,371 --> 02:46:14,204
Like he dropped acid and then 
hallucinates it should be little 

3551
02:46:16,430 --> 02:46:19,720
coordinate bus from the bag man thing.
Baghdad.

3552
02:46:20,390 --> 02:46:25,390
Oh,
it'd be bad if I was a controller.

3553
02:46:28,101 --> 02:46:29,900
Rewind.
I would be back that shit.

3554
02:46:31,160 --> 02:46:33,350
And the Christian girls do anal.
Yeah.

3555
02:46:34,580 --> 02:46:35,413
I don't know what you guys have against 
who's the rewind would be fucking 

3556
02:46:38,340 --> 02:46:40,350
amazing.
Let's h three wine,

3557
02:46:40,351 --> 02:46:43,490
this podcast please.
Hell yeah,

3558
02:46:43,520 --> 02:46:44,460
but we're only after this.

3559
02:46:46,750 --> 02:46:50,990
This is what you wanted as the,
and then he's talking to,

3560
02:46:50,991 --> 02:46:52,420
well it's like,
yeah,

3561
02:46:52,450 --> 02:46:54,410
well what do we all just singing and 
dancing?

3562
02:46:54,411 --> 02:46:57,020
Tried to impress will Smith,
is this what you wanted?

3563
02:46:57,021 --> 02:46:57,380
Well

3564
02:46:57,380 --> 02:47:00,440
apparently according to Marcus Brownley 
he,

3565
02:47:00,441 --> 02:47:01,274
he,
they shot like hours of footage for 

3566
02:47:03,021 --> 02:47:03,854
this.
But of course you only see like mere 

3567
02:47:05,061 --> 02:47:05,894
seconds.
So like I think they had a lot of 

3568
02:47:06,561 --> 02:47:07,394
different options,
which are the charters were you in last 

3569
02:47:09,860 --> 02:47:11,420
years I was in line or in the dance 
scene,

3570
02:47:11,421 --> 02:47:12,254
right?
Yeah.

3571
02:47:13,070 --> 02:47:15,110
There was like a second.
Have you,

3572
02:47:15,290 --> 02:47:16,123
did you know going in two years?
Two years ago there was like a frame of 

3573
02:47:19,401 --> 02:47:22,430
me last year there was a slight smidge 
more,

3574
02:47:22,431 --> 02:47:23,264
I think I remember seeing two years ago,
I did not know I would be like that cut 

3575
02:47:26,391 --> 02:47:28,780
out of it two years ago.
I had no fucking clue I had no,

3576
02:47:29,090 --> 02:47:29,923
it's just one of those like you're there
all day and make the most of it and you 

3577
02:47:31,911 --> 02:47:35,120
hope and you pray that some smidge of 
you makes it into the final cut.

3578
02:47:35,330 --> 02:47:36,163
That's all it is.
And they never guarantee it until like 

3579
02:47:37,971 --> 02:47:39,380
the day of fucking comes out.
Right.

3580
02:47:39,381 --> 02:47:41,110
Because they,
they have editors and they have notes.

3581
02:47:41,111 --> 02:47:41,944
They have producers.

3582
02:47:42,170 --> 02:47:43,003
So many different things.
The way they're very brand focused with 

3583
02:47:47,261 --> 02:47:47,750
this whole thing.

3584
02:47:47,750 --> 02:47:51,110
The entire thing is an advertisement.
It is to advertisers.

3585
02:47:51,140 --> 02:47:54,260
It's the show how,
how safe we are healing.

3586
02:47:54,261 --> 02:47:54,740
We are,

3587
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:56,000
you're going to make it.
They're like,

3588
02:47:56,030 --> 02:47:57,380
oh my God will smith.

3589
02:47:58,300 --> 02:47:59,440
Exactly.
And so like,

3590
02:47:59,441 --> 02:48:00,190
yeah,
everyone,

3591
02:48:00,190 --> 02:48:02,620
myself included,
made fun of Youtube rewind for like,

3592
02:48:02,650 --> 02:48:03,483
Oh will smith,
he's my favorite youtube pause for 

3593
02:48:06,101 --> 02:48:08,830
laughter.
But at the same time it's very appealing

3594
02:48:08,831 --> 02:48:13,831
to see this triple a list or Hollywood 
star in this thing because that's all it

3595
02:48:14,051 --> 02:48:14,771
is.
It's an,

3596
02:48:14,771 --> 02:48:17,650
it's an advertisement and I can't fault 
Youtube rewind reporter lay for that.

3597
02:48:18,920 --> 02:48:21,510
I mean they got to do what they gotta do
and that's all I'm saying.

3598
02:48:21,540 --> 02:48:25,130
And as long as people don't expect 
anything better.

3599
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:27,193
Right.
Because I feel like they have a seat of 

3600
02:48:29,931 --> 02:48:32,960
power,
crazy person because this thing came out

3601
02:48:33,140 --> 02:48:35,630
and everybody hated it and I was like,
wait,

3602
02:48:35,900 --> 02:48:39,620
you shocked you fucking surprise this.

3603
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:40,993
Well,
that's because these two pointed out in 

3604
02:48:43,001 --> 02:48:43,834
your excellent recap video that youtube 
rewind wasn't always this totally 

3605
02:48:47,951 --> 02:48:49,450
hateable thing.
In fact,

3606
02:48:49,451 --> 02:48:50,284
it used to be quite likable.
It's funny that I'm diving into being a 

3607
02:48:54,191 --> 02:48:56,200
complete asshole here because I've 
always said,

3608
02:48:56,280 --> 02:48:56,620
no,
no,

3609
02:48:56,620 --> 02:49:00,130
it's not you being an asshole.
It's just you'd be in fucking ignorant.

3610
02:49:00,131 --> 02:49:00,964
That's what it is.
They're a fucking EPK EPK electronic 

3611
02:49:05,741 --> 02:49:07,890
press kit.
It's just the fucking way to show

3612
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:09,550
you,
right?

3613
02:49:11,110 --> 02:49:13,410
You've been on set,
you've been on set before.

3614
02:49:13,780 --> 02:49:17,010
It's nonsense.
It's a fucking nonsense thing.

3615
02:49:17,011 --> 02:49:19,050
If you watch it and you're not an 
investor,

3616
02:49:19,370 --> 02:49:24,210
you're wasting as well.
Like they're,

3617
02:49:24,211 --> 02:49:25,350
yeah,
they got everybody,

3618
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:26,880
but,
but they didn't though.

3619
02:49:26,881 --> 02:49:30,120
They didn't get a lot of people that's 
not like funny or entertaining.

3620
02:49:30,300 --> 02:49:34,260
They didn't get a lot of key players 
that like Shane Dawson for example,

3621
02:49:34,261 --> 02:49:39,261
like he is like like him or not.
He was a huge part of youtube this year.

3622
02:49:39,780 --> 02:49:41,160
A lot of people.
Yeah and a lot of people.

3623
02:49:41,161 --> 02:49:41,994
Right.
It's not to shame.

3624
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:42,833
I thought people,
I think next year it's going to be 

3625
02:49:43,771 --> 02:49:45,810
awesome because they've got nothing to 
lose.

3626
02:49:45,870 --> 02:49:46,703
I think next year is going to rock more.
It's going to be Susan on her back of 

3627
02:49:49,420 --> 02:49:52,720
taking a giant check mark in the ass and
being like is this what you wanted?

3628
02:49:52,730 --> 02:49:54,030
Yeah,
super closeup.

3629
02:49:54,110 --> 02:49:56,180
Hairy asshole.
Cause she's a MILF,

3630
02:49:56,181 --> 02:49:58,000
right?
She's in the middle of the it.

3631
02:49:58,420 --> 02:49:59,850
He's in the milk category.

3632
02:50:00,280 --> 02:50:04,150
This term is that the baby's babies.
So you see a lot more than you borrowed.

3633
02:50:04,160 --> 02:50:07,740
We're starting the and then it's just 
her.

3634
02:50:07,741 --> 02:50:10,150
I'd like to apologize for everything you
can hurt.

3635
02:50:10,210 --> 02:50:11,910
They know.
So is this what you wanted?

3636
02:50:12,460 --> 02:50:17,460
Half a bottle of Bourbon and Scotch with
will smith tried to drown him.

3637
02:50:17,531 --> 02:50:20,430
Starts Will Smith and he goes to,
if I can show it we wide,

3638
02:50:20,980 --> 02:50:23,290
it wouldn't be Susan.
What jetski honor back,

3639
02:50:23,410 --> 02:50:25,750
making it up the ass with a verified 
check mark.

3640
02:50:26,730 --> 02:50:29,320
I knew she would be like,
and she'd be like,

3641
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:30,460
is this what you wanted?
Well,

3642
02:50:32,410 --> 02:50:37,150
floppy mom tips.
Put a camera on here next Tuesday.

3643
02:50:37,151 --> 02:50:42,151
We got a charity stream and her floppy 
mom laying on her stomach.

3644
02:50:45,280 --> 02:50:46,960
Awesome.
Awesome.

3645
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:49,470
On the chair.
It is termed don't miss it.

3646
02:50:52,540 --> 02:50:54,370
You guys are going to get towards your 
Joey Salads.

3647
02:50:54,420 --> 02:50:57,070
Yeah.
It's going to be next week on Tuesday.

3648
02:50:57,430 --> 02:50:58,880
No,
seriously.

3649
02:50:58,930 --> 02:51:01,990
Money and cruise day.
It's going to be huge.

3650
02:51:01,991 --> 02:51:05,560
It's gonna be one of our,
our biggest last year we raised 240,000

3651
02:51:05,561 --> 02:51:06,394
this year we're going to top it because 
we've got tons of amazing stuff to give 

3652
02:51:08,951 --> 02:51:11,170
away.
We've got Joey Salads back in the studio

3653
02:51:11,171 --> 02:51:14,170
to torture for our amusement.
We've got so much amazing stuff.

3654
02:51:14,320 --> 02:51:17,980
Rick and morty exclusive march,
age three historical March,

3655
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:18,993
and if you play your cards right,
you might see Susan Wichinski with a 

3656
02:51:21,901 --> 02:51:26,901
floppy man to watch joey cells die.

3657
02:51:32,500 --> 02:51:37,500
He's Mister Rick and morty.
He is brick and I'm just kidding.

3658
02:51:38,290 --> 02:51:39,123
Nobody wants love Susan.
She tries her best and she's good at 

3659
02:51:43,001 --> 02:51:43,900
her.
She's really crazy.

3660
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:48,620
Justin Reuland isn't music playing?
Yeah.

3661
02:51:48,700 --> 02:51:50,760
Okay,

3667
02:52:04,090 --> 02:52:05,410
you're going to work your way to the 
rot.

3668
02:52:05,470 --> 02:52:07,060
It's inevitable.
You know what I'm saying?

3669
02:52:07,090 --> 02:52:07,923

3674
02:52:19,330 --> 02:52:22,400
Float more once a month is good.
Once a week.

3675
02:52:23,510 --> 02:52:26,650
Oh right.
We all know that.
