00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,490
Okay,
you in five,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,320

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,593
two.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,330
Hello everybody and welcome to the 
podcast experience,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,410
also known as the correct opinions zone.
You disagree with the opinions here.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,483
Take a.
You might want to think twice because 

7
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,584
these are infallible,
highly uninformed and 100 percent 

8
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:26,220
correct all the time.
Couldn't possibly be wrong yet.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,283
This was not an option.
It's not in this cell with me as the 

10
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:32,010
beautiful,
talented and very ballou.

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,140
Isla Klein.
Round of applause.

12
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:37,430
And what else?
CEO and annecy.

13
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:38,310
Oh,

00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:58,500
We've got a lot to get to.
I've got a new mic.

21
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:03,501
How do I sound on the Saturday today 
we've got the Shane a jake documentary.

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,913
I want to talk a little bit about that.
Bill cosby has started a new sitcom and 

23
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:15,190
which he goes to prison,
which is a really,

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,000
really looking forward to that.
It's on NBC,

25
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:18,834
premieres this a fall at a pm.
Looking forward to bill cosby goes to 

26
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:25,710
prison.
We've also got drake and millie.

27
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,711
Bobby Brown had been raising eyebrows 
with their salacious.

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,210
I feel like that's over the top 
interesting relationship and much,

29
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,430
much more.
Oh,

30
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,960
welcome everybody.
To the age three.

31
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:44,070
Buck gas myriad's.
Alright,

32
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,480
thanks for coming everyone.
We really,

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,823
we got the best.
We got the best stuff here to talk 

34
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,590
about.
So from the top,

35
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:53,310
Shane and jake.
Shane Dawson is the king of Youtube.

36
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,703
Yeah.
These past couple of these were kind of 

37
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:03,480
the king of Youtube for like a past year
or something,

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,800
but these whole documentary series have 
just been over the,

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,420
over the top like um,
can you pull up his channel?

40
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,400
I want to show you the views that he's 
got there,

41
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,413
but right now he has just come out with 
a Jake Paul documentary called inside 

42
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:22,914
the mind of Jake Paul when he tries to 
understand really what's going on with 

43
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:27,780
that guy.
And I'm intrigued.

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,980
Let's see.
Let's see here.

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,390
I'm looking at look at all of his recent
views.

46
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,450
What does that look?
So low quality,

47
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,570
is that just part of the thing?
16 million.

48
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:41,300
Fourteen million.
18,

49
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,290
$24 million.
I mean this is just.

50
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,990
This is average stuff.
Yeah.

51
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,210
This is insane.
This is like new level shit.

52
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,493
So anyway,
his new documentary about Jake pauls 

53
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:52,694
out.
Look at this.

54
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,050
I loved this.
Um,

55
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,220
Jake's response to part one was number 
two,

56
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,053
trending with two point 2 million views 
in two days and Shane's video with 10 

57
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,530
million views in one day wasn't on 
trending.

58
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,230
I don't remember a damn.
What the hell?

59
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,563
What's the logic?
How do you trend Jake Paul's response 

60
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,510
video?
I don't know.

61
00:03:18,511 --> 00:03:21,490
I can,
they just fix the trending page and it's

62
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:26,440
like it's just not a trending page.
And if it is curated,

63
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:28,060
why did they keep trending?
Jake Paul,

64
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,320
if there's really no good explanation 
for why this would be there and not that

65
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:36,580
one,
it literally is counter intuitive.

66
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,750
That response isn't what's trending,
it's the topic itself,

67
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,200
it's just,
it's maddening.

68
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,330
But regardless.
So that's mine.

69
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,683
The crunch of it is that he's trying to 
see if Jake Paul's a sociopath and I 

70
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:59,530
personally don't think that Jake Paul's 
a sociopath.

71
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,364
I mean that's a tall claim,
but then it takes this twist where he's 

72
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,960
like,
well maybe he's a brother.

73
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,370
Logan is the sociopath and it's about 
him living in the shadow of his brother,

74
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,280
which is a really interesting twist and 
I definitely can see that.

75
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,630
I could see that.
Yeah,

76
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:14,464
I can see that for sure.
So I am looking forward to seeing how 

77
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,930
this series unveils.
But there was,

78
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,003
by the way,
I think Logan was blindsided by the 

79
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:24,340
whole thing because jake and his video 
was like,

80
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:27,820
I knew it was about sociopathy and he's 
like,

81
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:30,280
I'm not a sociopath so come make this 
documentary about me.

82
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:31,690
He's like,
he's going to be good pr for me.

83
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:32,524
Shit.
So Logan I think was blindsided that he 

84
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:36,784
was all the sudden coming under the 
magnifying lens and he just tweeted out 

85
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,970
this morning,
this I really didn't want to,

86
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:45,500
but I feel compelled to give my thoughts
on Shane series this far.

87
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,610
And then Shane actually responded a 
surprise extended finale.

88
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,760
Which is a shame.
Really.

89
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,550
Don't give a fuck he's ready.
But anyway,

90
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:00,220
the really intriguing thing for me and I
am,

91
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,800
I am,
I'm intrigued.

92
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:03,580
You know,
I'm,

93
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,580
I'm glued to the set here affect Shane 
has given a lot of youtubers hope,

94
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:12,400
kind of always channel and just turn the
second round.

95
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,950
Well for a long time he was a guy that 
just taste tested fast food.

96
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,430
Yeah.
For so long.

97
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,500
I don't know what he was doing before 
that.

98
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,460
Those probably.
He did like sketches and she said,

99
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,131
I don't know.
He's not.

100
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:28,880
He has two channels.
He's been kind of like,

101
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,690
been around forever and doing all kinds 
of different content,

102
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,390
but he was just eating food for a long 
time,

103
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,643
but he likes this lugged through it,
found his voice and he really has got 

104
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:43,090
this second wind that's unbelievable.
It's really cool.

105
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,000
I really liked the style of the document
date.

106
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,480
If it's fresh,
it's really well edited.

107
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,630
I Dunno who's editing that.
I'm sure Shane is probably sitting there

108
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:54,340
a lot with the editor,
but the editing.

109
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,910
Absolutely bananas.
Um,

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,150
he wears the same shirt in every video I
don't think.

111
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,990
Well,
I don't know if it's the same shirt,

112
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,390
but either that or he's like doug funny 
and he's got like,

113
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,430
you know,
you've ever done,

114
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,313
you know,
he dug high net worth doing the same 

115
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,653
outfit every day and,
but then there's an episode where he 

116
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,640
walks in the closet and he just has like
the same outfit.

117
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,040
He wears the same shirt.
God bless his soul.

118
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,680
Um,
yeah,

119
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,120
no,
but hey.

120
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,210
But there was one moment here that 
really broke my heart.

121
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,300
There was a moment in the new episode 
that really broke my heart as a fan,

122
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,480
as a call.
I want to say colleague,

123
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,840
but maybe an associate you could say as 
someone who's had him here,

124
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:45,710
a guest on our podcast,
it really broke my heart.

125
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,820
So here it is really going to talk about
this.

126
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,540
I do also remember like Jake Paul was on
it.

127
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,503
See if you notice anything here,
kind of missed the timestamp for 

128
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,320
Chrissake.
See if you notice anything here.

129
00:06:58,321 --> 00:06:59,660
Okay.
As he was talking about this,

130
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,010
okay,
listen closely,

131
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:04,200
my friends.
You're all going to really.

132
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,250
This is really upsetting,

133
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,500
but I do also remember like j Dot Paul 
was on a podcast and he was about to hit

134
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,850
10 million subscribers

135
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,090
cast on a podcast.
Damn,

136
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,380
now we're spending Shane,
my art.

137
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,973
Shane,
you break in my heart on what podcast 

138
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,663
cast

139
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,850
on a podcast.
Shane,

140
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,780
my family isn't.
My Godfather.

141
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,600
Pressure was on her podcast.
What family?

142
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,760
You come in my house.
You sit across the table from me,

143
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:48,310
but I get no respect to disrespect.
You come.

144
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,763
I'm a podcast on a podcast,
the podcast where you have a podcast in 

145
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,024
my mind.
It sounds like a perfect Italian 

146
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:06,110
godfather.
Impression spot on Shane.

147
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,060
Shane,
you break in.

148
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,090
My house is half Russian shade.
He'll break.

149
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,780
Break up.
My aunt gave.

150
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:27,614
Paul was honored

151
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,510
on a podcast.
Anyway,

152
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,950
God bless them.
I'm not upset.

153
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:33,784
I just thought it was funny.
I just thought it was a funny 

154
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,870
opportunity to do my well traveled,
well seasoned that Godfather but not one

155
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,490
in the pocket for a while here at the 
office.

156
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,100
Yeah,
I'm working on that.

157
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,680
My godfather accent for a long time.
So did you change your mind?

158
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:53,410
But Jake,
Paul or thing would know,

159
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,203
I never thought I,
I kind of always suspected that jake 

160
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,500
deep down isn't a bad guy.
I,

161
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,240
I had that impression when I sat here 
with him,

162
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,410
I thought,
you know,

163
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,720
because I had a conversation with him 
outside off camera and I was like,

164
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:15,570
do tell me straight.
We were walking to the bathroom together

165
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:16,404
and I was like,
and this was during their heyday when 

166
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:24,531
they were really competitive.
I was like telling you how are you guys?

167
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,790
Because it seems really toxic.
And he's.

168
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,370
And he said,
honestly,

169
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,070
it's really bad.
We honestly really hate each other.

170
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,670
He told me that in complete earnestness 
off camera and the hallway.

171
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,500
He's like,
it's really bad.

172
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:38,334
Honestly.
You can tell that the competitive it's 

173
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,310
mentalities real well.
Apparently Logan actually really fucked.

174
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:55,491
Did Jake's ex girlfriend like for real?
And then made like a distrac about it.

175
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,260
But Jack was like,
dude,

176
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,103
like,
like,

177
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,630
act like I know that's like good for 
views,

178
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:02,850
but that actually really hurts my 
feelings.

179
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,060
You know,
like these guys are fucking twisted.

180
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,660
But apparently jake actually gets into a
lot of this stuff.

181
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:11,520
So I'm looking forward to that,
but uh,

182
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,380
if you can help me with that music one 
more time.

183
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,030
Shane.
I,

184
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,720
I,
what I bring on,

185
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,550
we talk,
we sit across the tip.

186
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,243
Do I do to deserve this disrespect jazz.
This is getting better shit to 

187
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,470
disrespect.
I bring him here.

188
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,070
You sit across the table from me with 
that.

189
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,550
We have a good time.
What do I do with it?

190
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,860
Has Given me the crickets.

191
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,240
I should have.
Yeah,

192
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:48,360
you fucked up.
Moving on.

193
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,580
Bill cosby.
There's a new sitcom coming out on NBC,

194
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:56,660
which is a really ballsy play out their 
part.

195
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,720
Bill cosby goes to prison for sexual 
assault.

196
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:01,261
I was like,
wow,

197
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,570
that's really edgy idea.
Um,

198
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,800
wait.
Hold on.

199
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,800
It's not a sitcom in handcuffs.
After getting over three years in prison

200
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:15,090
for 2000 for rape.
Wait,

201
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,160
I thought.
Oh Man.

202
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:19,370
I thought it was just a sitcom.
What?

203
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,860
Welcome to Papa's house.
Welcome to Papa's house.

204
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:24,720
Aka Prison.
The clink.

205
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,280
Isn't that crazy?
It's the same with handcuffs.

206
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,280
Dude.
It is the weirdest timeline.

207
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,610
Can we just reflect on the fact that 81 
year old bill cosby worth $400,

208
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:46,350
million dollars,
America's most beloved entertainer,

209
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,770
Jello in coke,
sip and bill cosby is going,

210
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:52,330
not just America.
I was like,

211
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,783
interest

212
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,810
is going to prison at 81 years old for 
rape.

213
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,120
Fuck,
that's the weirdest timeline imaginable.

214
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,663
Oh my God.
He was convicted in April of drugging 

215
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:17,941
and sexually assaulting Andre Constand,
who testified that cosby violated her at

216
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:23,461
is Pennsylvania home in 2004 after she 
came to him for career advice shoe.

217
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,480
He was sentenced to three to 10 years 
for sexual assault.

218
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,803
He has to register as a sex offender.
He's classified as a sexually violent 

219
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,263
Predator online and they need to inform 
all their neighbors that have sexually 

220
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:45,690
violent Predator lives in the area 
that's a lifetime registration.

221
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,660
Although I don't think his life is going
to be much longer.

222
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,973
80 one in prison.
He's in general population to a lot of 

223
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:54,520
people were like,
oh,

224
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,900
he's going to get preferential 
treatment.

225
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,273
Listen to this.

226
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,463
Um,

227
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,960
he's in general population and he's so 
famous.

228
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:09,380
You know what they're doing because when
he talks to his wife and prison,

229
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,010
they have speaker phones and like 
everyone around can hear,

230
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,993
oh yeah,
it's all monitored because it's a 

231
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:17,240
fucking prison.
You know what I mean?

232
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,103
They always end.
The move is so everyone can hear you're 

233
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,870
near or if you're the police,
if you're working there,

234
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,520
you're listening to what they're talking
about.

235
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,590
And so people are paying.

236
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,780
They want to know everything he's 
talking about with his wife.

237
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,810
He saw all these tabloids are our 
publishing,

238
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,550
everything he's talking about with his 
wife.

239
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,510
They can do that.
Well,

240
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:38,290
that's how they found out.
But I mean pro,

241
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,020
no,
I'm sure it's probably illegal,

242
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:43,430
but people are getting paid.
Um,

243
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,083
here,
some of the anecdotes that came out of 

244
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:47,094
those phone conversations,
I'm in a phone call with his wife Cosby 

245
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:56,700
recounted that a hot dog bun was thrown 
at his face,

246
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,373
a cosby who was legally blind city fell 
down a flight of stairs because he 

247
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:05,370
wasn't being guided and was without his 
cane,

248
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,563
which was apparently taken away along 
with his shoe laces by correctional 

249
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:12,900
officers over fears that he might harm 
himself.

250
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,813
Cosby told his wife,
grabbed the check book and hire anyone 

251
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:22,000
and everyone who could get him out as 
soon as possible.

252
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,710
This mother fucker's worth $400,
million bucks.

253
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,960
And that money can not save him.
This article says he said it.

254
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,630
No,
the officials think he'll harm himself.

255
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,380
I mean,
cosby tells wife officials.

256
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,010
Oh,
he,

257
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,843
he told his wife though,
officials think all harm myself because 

258
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:46,830
they took away his cane and his 
shoelaces,

259
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,070
as I understand is normal,
but God damn.

260
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,550
Can you imagine you're just like in 
prison and you're like,

261
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,110
oh,
it's bill cosby know.

262
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,160
Hey Bill.
Oh,

263
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:06,161
and here's another great one.
His first meal and prison.

264
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,510
The NYLA pudding.
Yeah,

265
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,250
but the bunny at the.
You put the hot dog,

266
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,513
the face of the podium to the mouth.
Really showing off your impressions to 

267
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,890
that is the impression and experience 
the age and experience.

268
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,890
But Shit,
you know,

269
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,430
how could he do this?
You put the Putty,

270
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,843
you came here,
I gave you politic and you said a 

271
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,960
podcast.
How am I doing over impression?

272
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,450
I'll animate crossovers right there.
Um,

273
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,690
so I think it's so pathetic.
God.

274
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,903
Bill cosby in prison at 81.
So weird people will throw in a hot dog 

275
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:50,744
buns at his face like,
like that's maybe the biggest fall from 

276
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:58,880
grace of all time.
Like Shakespeare,

277
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,930
the Greek mythology have stories of from
king to peasant.

278
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,193
I mean,
this is a literal story of being bill 

279
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:08,120
Cosby,
beloved,

280
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,470
powerful,

281
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,893
rich,
beyond imagination to inmates throwing 

282
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,860
hot dog,
stale hot dog buns at your face.

283
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,450
Well,
the guy was a fucking prolific predator.

284
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,460
The stories of what that guy

285
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,840
did was really remarkable.
I mean,

286
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:38,050
really astounding stuff.
Actually have some clips.

287
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,130
Um,
this one is really incredible.

288
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:45,190
It's a clip of from his old show,
the cosby show,

289
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,490
beloved,
by all where he talks about he's doing a

290
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:54,070
barbecue and he's like.
And his wife was like,

291
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,860
isn't it so nice how everyone's getting 
along after they were fighting?

292
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,750
And he goes,
hey,

293
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,490
it's,
it's the secret is my barbecue sauce.

294
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,720
She's like,
oh,

295
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,740
you're kidding.
He's like,

296
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,420
oh,
I'm dead serious.

297
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,270
And he doesn't smile.
His face is like dead pan.

298
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,870
He's sinister sounding.
And he continues.

299
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:16,360
He goes,
oh no,

300
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:17,194
I'm dead serious.
You ever notice when you have my 

301
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,190
barbecue sauce that everyone gets 
happier and gets a little too fondly?

302
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,300
I'm dead serious and,
and he continues and she goes,

303
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:29,610
stop it and,
and,

304
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,620
and you almost feel like she's being 
creeped out,

305
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:34,300
but I believe this.
She's like,

306
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:35,081
stop it.
And he's like,

307
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:36,250
no,
I'm serious.

308
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,380
I've got the clip.
I'd like to show you.

309
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,340
Yeah,
let's watch it.

310
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,440
Um,
and then at the end of the clip,

311
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:42,274
the kids are eating the barbecue and he 
comes and takes it away from them real 

312
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:48,430
fast.
Implying that it is not a joke.

313
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,740
And so here,
let me,

314
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,380
let me.
I mean,

315
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,230
this shit is unbelievable.
It really is truly something baby.

316
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,380
A bill cosby,
special bbq sauce.

317
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,223
I wonder if he was.
This is definitely anecdotal from his 

318
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,530
real life outside the show.

319
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,230
Watch his face.
Work things out for themselves.

320
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,490
It's my barbecue sauce.
Barbecue sauce.

321
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,763
Barbecue sauce.
Haven't you ever noticed after my 

322
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,580
barbecue sauce?
After awhile when it kicks in,

323
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,590
they get all huggy bugging.
I'm dead serious.

324
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,450
Haven't one of my people want to get 
right home.

325
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Let me do something else.
I got a cup of it up on the night table.

326
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,153
Correct.

327
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,560
I got a cup of it,
said breathing.

328
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,880
Somebody talks to his victims.
Chicken to these people are going up and

329
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,983
absence is threatening her.
So here's the rest of the chicken 

330
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,853
chicken.

331
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,400
Wow.
How is that like family content?

332
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,613
You know,
I think it was just like wacky at the 

333
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,620
actual context.
Well,

334
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:44,400
even the context at the time is that 
he's put a drug and the bar,

335
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,293
I mean there's no other way to.
They haven't worked anything out for 

336
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:52,160
themselves.
That's all on my barbecue sauce.

337
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,440
You seen.
Oh,

338
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,860
stop it.
Stop anything.

339
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,443
In fact,
I got a big bucket of barbecue sauce in 

340
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:05,470
the room.
Are you coming up or do I have to force?

341
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:08,280
You know.
And so somebody,

342
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:12,410
of course I'm some genius.
Um,

343
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,960
his name is,
uh,

344
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,030
you God made an edit that I like to 
share with you guys.

345
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,060
That really captures the moment more 
accurately I would say.

346
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,383
Let's see.

347
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,910
Yeah,
it

348
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,070
certainly is nice to see them work 
things out for themselves.

349
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Take up the left track for themselves.
When it kicks in,

350
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,620
they get all her buggy hockey.
Pocky stops,

351
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,053
right?

352
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,810
It's a threat.
What can we look at his body language?

353
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,743
I got a cup of chicken before.
If this was a scene from like a horror 

354
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,200
chicken,
he's like a serial killer or something.

355
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,810
I wouldn't be surprised if they played 
this in court during this trial.

356
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,970
We got a sound bite.
The lawyer said like,

357
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:41,100
you know in every joke there's a little 
bit of truth.

358
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,510
Right?
Exactly.

359
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,240
Yeah.
I think that's a good legal argument.

360
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,990
We got a sound bite.
Some of these barbecue sauce clips.

361
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:53,991
I feel like these have a perpetual use.
I love this barbecue sauce.

362
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,150
I'm telling you.
That was.

363
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,410
That was courtesy of a eat.
God actually.

364
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,244
You know what?
I don't know how long the store's been 

365
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,570
been in the news,
but this is eight years old.

366
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,273
Sorry,
I'm literally dyslexic out dyslexia it 

367
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:21,320
out three years old.
I actually,

368
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:25,000
you know what I did?
I cut the eight and half in my mind.

369
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,150
[inaudible] it's three.
Half of eight.

370
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,550
Like literally if you cut it in half,
you see it three.

371
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,470
So you completed that.
I completed the three in my mind.

372
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:41,310
I know it's a really incredible stuff.
Is it not?

373
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,413
Not.
I'm going to say this to you whenever I 

374
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:50,690
want to get it on and now you're not.
Be like the barbecues outside.

375
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,890
Why don't we go on upstairs?
Somebody's either got the bomb.

376
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:59,790
Mccune saw sand,

377
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,790
two new meaning of lube it up.
When do I have here?

378
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,520
Either you want to go.
So all the songs you sing found a little

379
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:11,630
sleeping,
a little,

380
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:13,310
uh,
unconscious.

381
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,403
A little,
uh,

382
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,340
Amnesia and so on.
The sauce play some creepy music guys.

383
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,853
But it's all on the sauce.
You've seen either you feeling a little 

384
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,540
sleepy,
a little amnesia,

385
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,311
you know,
lay down,

386
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:30,740
close your eyes for get it all happen.
You're kidding,

387
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:33,600
right?
Oh No.

388
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,780
Tom,
the sauce.

389
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,100
I guess we have no creepy music.

390
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,653
Oh,

391
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,030
I feel like the moments gone enough.

392
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,360
I'm on the sauce.
Wow.

393
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,660
Welcome to Papa's house.
Oh,

394
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,740
that's a man that knows how to saw some 
pie on the sauce for him too.

395
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,440
Now let's all give praise,
by the way,

396
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,900
to Hannibal burress,
who,

397
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,860
who by the way,
let's all remember the Hannibal.

398
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:10,130
Did this explosive standups several 
years ago,

399
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,130
somebody just filmed it on their phone,
everything,

400
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,390
right?
It wasn't on comedy central or anything.

401
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:21,050
He was just at a nightclub and somebody 
filmed it on the phone and put it online

402
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:23,630
and it made headlines because bill 
[inaudible] Hannibal was like,

403
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:24,464
Fuck Bill.
Cause we always tell them black people 

404
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,623
what to do from like a,
from like a pet is still always being 

405
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:30,524
like black,
black people need to bootstrap 

406
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:32,930
themselves up like me.
He's like,

407
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:33,764
he's a fucking rapist.
That was the first time I never heard 

408
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:37,870
that.
I didn't know that.

409
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,140
He was like,
seriously go google bill cosby raped and

410
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:41,983
see what you find.
And that was the catalyst that started 

411
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:46,300
this whole thing here.
Let's watch that clip.

412
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,870
So start me to probably,
I think,

413
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,740
I mean that was really a prolific.
Not Prolific,

414
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:58,070
but it was a monumental.
It may have.

415
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,890
Yeah,
animal God damn

416
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,090
it was great but built stage crazy that 
he broke down and a great job too.

417
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:44,020
But it was shocking at the time.
Well that's a ballsy claim to make about

418
00:25:47,611 --> 00:25:47,720
it.

419
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,120
Anyone publicly to be like,
Oh yeah,

420
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:51,440
but you rape people.
It's like,

421
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,870
what?
I can't really say that.

422
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,970
Wow,
that's great.

423
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:02,050
Credible stamats,
puddling teflon image.

424
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,210
Middle States.
When people,

425
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,440
they rape allegations,
call me captain,

426
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,860
kick him out.
That shit is upset.

427
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,180
If you didn't know about it,
trust me.

428
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,120
You leave in Google,
Bill Cosby,

429
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:38,954
right?
Right.

430
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,090
Okay.
Stand

431
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,100
up.
And um,

432
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,620
yeah,
that's really incredible stuff.

433
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,080
So shout out to the animal.
Got Goddamn.

434
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,210
Well,
let's throw it to a break.

435
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,360
We will be right back after these 
messages from me out of my mouth,

436
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,770
from the sponsors on a paper through my 
mouth to you.

437

we keep them and we keep them exciting.

because it's really fun and exciting.

439
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,803
Really entertaining copyrights.
We'll be back after that to talk about 

440
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,040
drake creeping up.

Yeah.

589
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,053
Well,
and for good reason I think because I 

590
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,330
find it now,
first of all,

591
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,530
now spot speaking as a 33 year old band.
I'm close to drake and age.

I'm not really sure.

596
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,763
I can't say,
but then when she goes on to describe 

597
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:58,060
their relationship,
I not only raised one eyebrow,

598
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,710
raised both my eyebrows.

599
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,960
At first I heard about it because I 
think he invited her to a show and there

600
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,270
was like a picture of them together and 
it was all cool.

601
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:11,110
It was clear that he is a funnel for 
which who is not cool.

602
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,650
Like she seems like such a bad as on the
show.

603
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,400
Yes.
And she was a fan of him so all good.

604
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,290
But then now it's like,

605
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,443
well she did these interviews or she's 
getting into details of like we taxed 

606
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:25,334
and we talk and he says that I missed 
you so much and I tell him I miss him 

607
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,610
and I imagined him,
him,

608
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,920
him at home being like,
no,

609
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,720
shut up.
Know.

610
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:35,823
Um,
and there's another one where she's 

611
00:36:37,371 --> 00:36:41,030
like,
so I met him at a hotel and then we went

612
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:41,864
out for dinner and then we're hanging 
out every night for three days and now 

613
00:36:44,361 --> 00:36:47,510
we text each other all the time and we 
love each other and I'm just like whoa.

614
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,730
And is giving her advice on like boys 
and dating?

615
00:36:52,731 --> 00:36:53,564
Yeah.

616
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,730
And he's just got to be at home being 
like,

617
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,360
God.
All I'm saying is drake,

618
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:04,361
be careful because Papa's house is not.
We don't need another.

619
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,800
We didn't want them to Papa's house.
Barber's house.

620
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:13,190
Don't need another inmate that here.
Let's watch some of these videos.

621
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,150
This is the first video that came out of
her talking about him.

622
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,713
Let me throw this up.
This is a little excerpt of the video 

623
00:37:23,181 --> 00:37:24,014
for you.

624
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,200
Gosh,
he's not my crush.

625
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,280
Okay,
let me get this straight.

626
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:30,410
He's like a brother.
His brother.

627
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,813
I met drake in an Australian hotel.
I was touring and he was touring to and 

628
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:39,350
he honestly,
his managers,

629
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:43,490
this came up to my dad and said try it 
gloves the show come to a show tonight.

630
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,730
And I was like,
oh my goodness.

631
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,623
My dad honestly it was on t mobile,
the French team mobile trying to get as 

632
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:50,900
Wifi from Australia.
He was like,

633
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,120
I don't know who drake is,
was like,

634
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,140
are you joking me?
Drink Shit.

635
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,550
He wants to see me.
I was like,

636
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,900
okay,
we're going.

637
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:04,820
So I like got my outfit prepared at,
went there and he was such a fan boy and

638
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:08,930
it was such a fan girl that we honestly,
we text all the time now.

639
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:11,750
He helps me with everything,
like just life lessons.

640
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,670
Um,
he's amazing.

641
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:14,504
He's a great human being.
And we went to dinner afterwards and we 

642
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,044
had dinner the next day and then we met 
in Sydney hotline bling is one of my 

643
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,773
favorites.

644
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,463
The part where she goes,
we met for dinner and then we kept 

645
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:29,590
meeting for dinner next thing all the 
time.

646
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,510
Texting all the time.
I mean,

647
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,003
again,

648
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,950
it's just,
I feel like from perspective,

649
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:36,100
I

650
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,920
see why she doesn't think it's a 14 year
old girl.

651
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,420
Yeah.
And she thinks she's an adult,

652
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,490
like you know,
at that age you're like,

653
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,240
I'm an adult at 14.
Yeah.

654
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,030
And she definitely has that air.
She's a sweet girl.

655
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:52,410
She's amazing.
But you can tell she thinks she's

656
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,910
very mature.
Fourteen year old too.

657
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,240
But being 30 years old,
being 31.

658
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,800
And from our perspective it looks really
weird.

659
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,230
Os being closer in age.

660
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,830
Do you love me?
Are you writing?

661
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,740
Do you have a cell next to cars?
Be You love me?

662
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,990
Yeah.
And so anyway,

663
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,080
that's part one.
Okay,

664
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,170
that's fine.
Um,

665
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,020
Kiki,
are you 14?

666
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,123
Do you love me?
Do you have a prison cell next to cars 

667
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:34,720
be?
Um,

668
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:38,050
so that's part one.
Welcome to Papa's house.

669
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,370
Here's part two.
This one just,

670
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:44,560
I guess came out about your relationship
with drake.

671
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,300
Tell me about that.

672
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:52,310
People have such as these a red carpet 
fucking interviews.

673
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,453
Yeah.
They like don't bat an eye and they're 

674
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:56,410
like,
oh yeah.

675
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,540
Tell me about your relationship with 
drake.

676
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,593
What about your religion?

677
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,233
Drank.
I think you want to tell me about your 

678
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:08,730
friendship.
How did this all come about?

679
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:12,360
I love him.
I met him in Australia and he's honestly

680
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:14,820
so fantastic and a great friend and a 
great,

681
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,140
a great role model.
You know,

682
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:16,974
we text,
we just text each other the other day 

683
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:19,140
and he was like,
I miss you so much.

684
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:20,170
It was like,
I miss you more.

685
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,210
He's coming.

686
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,043
He's like,
Oh,

687
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:27,150
don't fucking say that guy's shows how 
innocent and immature she is firsthand.

688
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,170
You,
you cannot.

689
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,670
As a 31 year old man text a 14 year old 
girl that's not related to you.

690
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,210
I miss you so much.
[inaudible] cannot.

691
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,473
And the fact that she doesn't understand
that so little that even to her saying 

692
00:40:42,991 --> 00:40:44,850
that doesn't look weird.

693
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,860
Um,

694
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,880
no she hasn't.
She,

695
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:52,881
I think she even made like a statement 
about it really just like a,

696
00:40:53,341 --> 00:40:56,730
you guys can't tell me who can be my 
friend.

697
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,310
Just stopped making it awkward.
Okay.

698
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,473
But that's why I'm saying I don't think 
she can understand at her age how weird 

699
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:05,490
it is.
No,

700
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,790
no.
Yeah,

701
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,623
I agree.
Yeah.

702
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,780
I feel,
you know.

703
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,260
Yeah.
What can I say?

704
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:17,310
A lot of people say he's grooming her.
That's just such a weird state.

705
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,700
I don't know the term.
What is grown.

706
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,603
Basically what it means is that like 
he's preparing her or when she turns 18 

707
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,690
so that he can legally hit it.

708
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,553
Yeah.

709
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:33,050
Apparently he four years of dedication.
Yeah.

710
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,070
Allegedly

711
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,050
he's done that with a,
some kind of 16 year old girl.

712
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,420
Ian Was Ian's the keeper of culture and 
knowledge,

713
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:43,700
but I don't want to get the facts mixed 
up.

714
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,730
But allegedly,
and this is from a second hand report,

715
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:47,564
but there was some sticks.
16 girl he met when she was 16 and when 

716
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:53,600
she turned 18 they started dating.
Really?

717
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:57,080
Yeah.
Allegedly and I may maybe false.

718
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:57,914
So again,
take everything I say here as pure fact 

719
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,020
and not speculate them.
Kiki,

720
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,870
are you riding?
Are you 14?

721
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:10,783
Welcome to Papa's house.
The other wrinkle in of this is like 

722
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,650
people are saying,
um,

723
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,780
he's just helping her out because he was
a child star to.

724
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:22,770
Right.
Okay.

725
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,020
You know what I mean?
That's sweet.

726
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,660
That's a sweet angle here.
You want to see what she.

727
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,070
Yeah.
What'd she say?

728
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,630
Why do I say,
Oh,

729
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,000
you gotta close your window.
Let me finish this.

730
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,253
Let me see what.

731
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,320
I'm definitely gonna.
Go and see him.

732
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,460
I'm so excited.
Yeah.

733
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,380
And Drake.
That's awesome.

734
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,720
That's awesome.
What advice does he give you?

735
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:44,990
Like what does he say about boys?
He helps me

736
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,940
and then it's like,
why does it always gotta go there?

737
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,020
Like,
damn,

738
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,660
we talk about other shit.
What are you going to go there?

739
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,880
We always talk about boy.

740
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,160
Yeah,
he's great.

741
00:42:55,161 --> 00:42:57,230
He's wonderful.
I love the advice with boys,

742
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,840
you know,
that stays in the text messages.

743
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,440
Alright.
So what else we got here?

744
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,110
So she said,
why you got to make a lovely friendship.

745
00:43:07,111 --> 00:43:08,580
Your headline,
you guys are weird.

746
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,473
For Real.
I'm lucky to have people in business 

747
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,390
expand.
Yeah.

748
00:43:12,391 --> 00:43:13,620
She,
I mean again,

749
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,870
like you said,
she just,

750
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,543
she,
yeah,

751
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:18,863
like you said you.

752
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,343
Yeah.

753
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:30,130
But the child star angle is a,
is a valid defense,

754
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:30,964
you know,
and I'm not accusing the guy have 

755
00:43:32,491 --> 00:43:33,420
anything.
It's just a lot.

756
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,190
But you know,
but it's hard to explain that.

757
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,320
Him texting her,
I miss you very much.

758
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,570
Yeah.
She's like,

759
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,850
and he initiated it.
She was like,

760
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:45,610
he texted me out of the blue.
I miss you very much.

761
00:43:45,611 --> 00:43:46,990
And I was like,
I miss you too.

762
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,000
[inaudible].
I was just reciprocating.

763
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,940
Kiki,
are you 14?

764
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,330
Are you riding?
Get some quaaludes in that Jello when.

765
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:03,490
Let's get barbecue sauce.
Head on upstairs.

766
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,290
All right,
well,

767
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,440
there you have it.
Drake and millie.

768
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:15,610
Bobby Brown.
Next up,

769
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,250
we've got stories for days,
folks.

770
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:21,790
This is the h three podcast experience.
We've got stories for days.

771
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:24,670
We've got the best stories people.
This is my trump impression.

772
00:44:24,671 --> 00:44:27,640
Now we've got the best stories.
People the best.

773
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:28,474
Okay.
You come here once you do a trump 

774
00:44:29,591 --> 00:44:31,560
impression.
This show is gone.

775
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:31,980
I'm

776
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,920
not criticizing,
I'm just doing an impression.

777
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,720
Listen,
we've got the best stores.

778
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:39,090
People.
I got the hand motion,

779
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:40,440
right?
We've got the.

780
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,420
Believe me,
we've got the best stores.

781
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:45,840
Believe me,
doing a trump impression is like so many

782
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:48,060
bad ones,
unlike mine,

783
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,093
the handmade.
It's a really fun impression because of 

784
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:57,280
all this.
Just show as really gone downhill.

785
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,940
Yeah.
Well along with everything else,

786
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,100
so I'm fucking right there.
Believe,

787
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,020
believe me,
they actually podcast.

788
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,660
Believe me,
the HCD podcast.

789
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:10,740
It's the best.
Okay.

790
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,990
Got The best stories.
The best people take her from me.

791
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,870
I would know.
Trust me.

792
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,060
It's the best.
Was that good?

793
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,040
I mean,
obviously the voice Jimmy Fallon's,

794
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,113
cold bear has by far the worst.
I cannot stand coal bears trump 

795
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:35,151
impression mostly because he thinks it's
so good and he talks so slow.

796
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,610
It's like,
oh my God.

797
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,503
It's like dude,
like talks like this is his intros are 

798
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:46,050
good,
but then the impressions that were so.

799
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,900
It just slows the show down.
He could.

800
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,390
I was like this,
ah,

801
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,380
at,
believe me,

802
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:55,230
this show is that bass?
I don't know.

803
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,750
That's actually the best impression 
you've done so far.

804
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,800
Have Cole bear doing trump really solid.
Thank you Dan.

805
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,331
Hey,
there you go.

806
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:04,164
I got something up my sleeve.
I just need like three layers of 

807
00:46:05,821 --> 00:46:09,150
separation from the source oppression 
and then it's good.

808
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,860
Anyway.
Well let's get the fuck on with it.

809
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,933
Papa John.
Is it the house and an effort to 

810
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:18,810
distance themselves?
Do it.

811
00:46:18,811 --> 00:46:19,644
By the way,
Papa John's the company is unlike a 

812
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,440
mutiny.
I've been watching the show,

813
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:28,120
the profit.
So the pro here,

814
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:29,303
this is gonna make sense in the follow 
up with me because the profit is this 

815
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:32,754
guy a marcus lemonis and he's like this 
business guru and what he does is he 

816
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:41,430
goes and invests in company and helps 
them become profitable.

817
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,820
He sees the potential in them,
but the business owners are really.

818
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,890
They're just fucking dumb.
Like Nathan for you in real reality.

819
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,220
Right?
And the problem is usually the companies

820
00:46:53,221 --> 00:46:54,054
have an interesting product or an 
interesting market share or something 

821
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:59,580
like that that he can work with,
but the owner is always just like,

822
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:01,943
just so fucking stupid.
Like it's really a lot of common sense 

823
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:04,711
stuff.
He's like,

824
00:47:04,711 --> 00:47:07,620
all right,
so you guys,

825
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,330
I see you profitted half a million 
dollars last year,

826
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,890
but somehow you still lost $300,000
in debt and the owner's like,

827
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:18,720
yeah,
well I bought a $300,000

828
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,880
truck to help promote them or something 
like that.

829
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,250
And that's a real one.
Yeah.

830
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,173
Are there like a.
he's got this big trucks thing outside 

831
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:27,960
of their office.
He's like,

832
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:30,640
well it's a half a million truck.
I've got a big discount on that.

833
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,490
Marcus is like,
you gotta sell the truck though.

834
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:38,730
Well I did sign up for that breakdown 
for that or it's always like a,

835
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,000
Oh man.
It's always like,

836
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,893
this is a really common one.
He goes and talks to all the employees 

837
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:49,300
and they're all amazing and super hard 
working and they're like,

838
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:50,200
yeah,
he's never here.

839
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,150
He just ever comes here.
The owner,

840
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,310
he just never comes here.
He's not involved at all.

841
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,511
Oh.
He's like,

842
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:57,760
okay,
so I need you to come to work five times

843
00:47:57,761 --> 00:47:58,571
a week.
Oh,

844
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:01,390
I did.
Well I did sign up for that.

845
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,880
Okay.
It's always the same dumb shit.

846
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,270
So a funny show.
Well anyway,

847
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:15,300
my favorite episodes is when it becomes 
a full on mutiny and it's so juicy,

848
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:22,300
so he comes in at the request of the 
owner and the owner is such a buffoon.

849
00:48:22,301 --> 00:48:23,134
He's so incompetent that he makes a pact
with the employees and they all turned 

850
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:31,030
against the owner who called him and 
asked him and then he gets all defensive

851
00:48:31,031 --> 00:48:35,200
because often he'll give equity to the 
employees and then it's like.

852
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,700
And then they're always like,
fuck you,

853
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:38,590
you're not my boss anymore.
Suck my Dick.

854
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:39,424
I hate you.
They actually have conversations and 

855
00:48:42,191 --> 00:48:43,030
it's so good.

856
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:46,870
Or the owner will come in and he's like,
I don't like how you're doing this,

857
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,870
whatever.
And then the employee who now has equity

858
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:50,571
will say,
well,

859
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:51,404
you're not my boss.

860
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,220
Fuck you.
Marcus comes in and he's like,

861
00:48:54,221 --> 00:48:55,060
well yeah,
he's right.

862
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:56,980
Fuck you.
You suck.

863
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,020
And then they always go like,
oh,

864
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,863
well I,
I,

865
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,110
it's my company and I'm going to run it 
the way I am.

866
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:03,280
And the market is like,
well,

867
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,233
you wrote it the way you are.
Then this business is going to be out 

868
00:49:06,281 --> 00:49:07,114
of.
You're going to be closing the doors in 

869
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:10,600
two days because you don't know how to 
run a business and it's so great.

870
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,990
So that's what's happening in Papa 
John's.

871
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,570
There's a full on a mutiny at Papa 
Johns.

872
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,380
He hasn't been outed.
His faces off all of the branding.

873
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:25,410
Remember Papa John Built this company.
He is fucking name right now.

874
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:33,010
It's Steve Papa Steve's house.
Welcome to Steve's house.

875
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:37,420
So there were moving his face even at 
the headquarters.

876
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:38,463
They're doing a huge makeover at the 
headquarters where they're removing his 

877
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:42,100
face off the welfare check.

878
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,040
It's not worth the money they're 
spending on all.

879
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,520
Well,
they're betting well,

880
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:46,354
they must be hurting again.
They're in like full panic mode and so 

881
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,813
they've even gone as far as to remove 
the apostrophe from Papa John's Papa 

882
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:02,041
John's international filed paperwork 
about the new spelling and brand imagery

883
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:06,460
with the US patent and trademark office 
in late August.

884
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,533
Removing the possessive apostrophe and 
Papa Johns would in theory provide a 

885
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:12,754
more distance between the company and 
its founder so it doesn't look like he 

886
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:19,120
owns the business.
That is the dumbest shit.

887
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,153
The funny name.
So it's bumper John's without 

888
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:26,650
unimpressed by it.
It doesn't make sense.

889
00:50:26,651 --> 00:50:28,310
It's a,
it's a possessive s.

890
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,390
his name is Papa John.
So what is the [inaudible] indicates the

891
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,480
basic grammar that I do know.
Not grammatically correct.

892
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:37,610
Yeah.
Isla is,

893
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:43,750
she's fluent in English and um,
so anyway,

894
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:48,791
the apostrophe is out.
That faith is out and they have released

895
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:54,521
this heart wrenching.
I'm really powerful movement.

896
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,060
Did you,
do you like the,

897
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,360
you know,
look so lame.

898
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,260
It's not down.
Not the Papa John.

899
00:51:00,261 --> 00:51:02,390
I know.
And love by the way.

900
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:04,790
They are also removing the better 
ingredients.

901
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:09,791
Better Pizza I read.
That's a classic level by the way guys.

902
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:14,300
It's not that fucking serious you're 
selling pies.

903
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:20,110
But anyway,
save that because they made this ad that

904
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:24,200
they posted on their twitter and it's 
like a whole campaign about like a,

905
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,370
we're so sorry.
We are so disappointed.

906
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,610
We have to do better.
And it's like the saddest,

907
00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:32,444
most emotional shit ever.
And I would like to play that for you 

908
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,380
now with your permission.
Actually,

909
00:51:37,381 --> 00:51:39,390
I don't need your permission.
You have no control over the show.

910
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:42,763
I hope you'll enjoy it.
So they compiled a bunch of tweets that 

911
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:47,390
they got.

912
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:47,990
Yeah.

913
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,823
Huh.

914
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,063
You know what?
I wonder if it's really hurting their 

915
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:52,054
business or they or they're freaking out
because they're getting like social 

916
00:51:55,661 --> 00:51:58,390
media backlash.
Well,

917
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:03,360
the easiest way to look at this stock 
thought value,

918
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:09,050
Papa John's.
I mean people who looks like they're.

919
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:15,050
I mean it looks pretty well actually in 
the five days.

920
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,631
Okay.
Hang on,

921
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:16,350
let me,
let me,

922
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,183
let me open this up here.
This is the one year graph you guys can 

923
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:20,664
see.
It looks like they took a big hit 

924
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,720
recently from the Papa.
Okay,

925
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,460
let's go to five years.
Let's just get.

926
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,020
Oh yeah,
they took a big hit.

927
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,430
Let's go max years.
Let's see.

928
00:52:29,431 --> 00:52:31,650
The historical data here.
Okay.

929
00:52:31,651 --> 00:52:33,390
That's not that helpful.
Let's go five years.

930
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,120
So you can see,
do one year,

931
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:41,610
one year they took a big hit from Papa,
Papa,

932
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:42,543
John,
but they're climbing back and I think 

933
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,730
yeah,
I guess see,

934
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,573
it's hard to know if it's from their 
efforts or people are just over it and 

935
00:52:49,561 --> 00:52:51,540
they want people to again,
they just want pizza,

936
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,190
you know?
But they're like,

937
00:52:53,191 --> 00:52:55,760
no,
it's an apostrophe like that.

938
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:56,520
A pause,
freak,

939
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,650
genius.
We made a billion dollars.

940
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:00,523
I just looked it up and I see an article
that says it was from the beginning of 

941
00:53:03,061 --> 00:53:05,070
August that their sales overall,
nationally,

942
00:53:05,071 --> 00:53:07,790
it was down to seven percent.
I mean that.

943
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:11,190
That is significant.
I mean it's not as much as I expected it

944
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,660
on.
It's not a huge difference,

945
00:53:12,661 --> 00:53:15,780
but it's.
The old logo is superior.

946
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,490
I agree.
Just like their pizza.

947
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,350
Anyway,
I'm.

948
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:21,683
Here we go.

949
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,680
We heard you papa John's.

950
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,320
I am so disappointed in this company.
I'll never order it.

951
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,570
Neil again.
So it's like all this to eight.

952
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:34,100
I'd rather have frozen pizza then racist

953
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,130
pizza.
They're really owning it.

954
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,263
Like they're actually like railing the 
original pop up because they're being 

955
00:53:40,841 --> 00:53:42,340
like,
we are race.

956
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:45,850
We weren't racist pizza.
But that was,

957
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:46,953
that was,
that was that fucking guy who made this 

958
00:53:49,721 --> 00:53:53,380
company that we're all riding.
Racism is disgusting and I won't support

959
00:53:53,381 --> 00:53:54,214
it.

960
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:56,723
The Leaf poppage nice name.
Remember when we were actually making 

961
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:03,810
progress in civil rights issues,
you expected better from Papa John's.

962
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,043
Why is this?
Why is the music of like a suicide 

963
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:11,520
prevention?
It's like Papa John's.

964
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:16,521
The company is on suicide watch purpose.
David Papa Steve's on suicide watch.

965
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,350
You expected better from Papa John's.
So did wait.

966
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,360
What does he make of all this was 
sitting at home watching this shit.

967
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,430
He wants to be furious.
Yeah.

968
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:30,933
Papa's into what is both.
Think about this a little too late on 

969
00:54:37,451 --> 00:54:38,284
this.
Blaming players for poor sales with dog 

970
00:54:40,061 --> 00:54:41,880
whistle racism with a half move.

971
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,333
Yeah.
It's just a bunch of these kinds of 

972
00:54:43,761 --> 00:54:47,790
tweaks.
I will not give you any more money.

973
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,060
I don't know what anything will do to 
earn my business ever again.

974
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,700
Won't put another diamond to Papa 
John's.

975
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,910
Not the poor company.
Until you change your policies,

976
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:59,710
pitiful.
Look in the mirror.

977
00:54:59,711 --> 00:55:03,980
Stop the flip and blame and do better.
Thank you for your anger.

978
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,810
It's almost like pathetic.
How like a.

979
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,140
it's like stand up for yourself,
Papa.

980
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,670
John,
thank you for your anger.

981
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,660
Thank you for your criticism and thank 
you for your honesty.

982
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:20,260
I'm going to call the police.
I think Papa John's on suicide watch.

983
00:55:20,261 --> 00:55:22,200
I don't want to get an officer over 
there to the headquarters.

984
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,330
Not going to hurt themselves.
The whole company,

985
00:55:25,331 --> 00:55:26,164
the whole company.
Thank you for your honesty is making us 

986
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:31,810
better.
Just like our pizza.

987
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,920
Better ingredients,
better pizza.

988
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:37,803
We already have the best pizza,
but your honesty is making us as people 

989
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:41,794
better.

990
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:48,350
What did I go to Papa John's sitting at 
home like Steve,

991
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,180
what did I do to deserve this 
disrespect?

992
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,730
Just by company.
I built this company with my own hands.

993
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,000
I tossed the dough.
I made the ingredients.

994
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,420
What did I do to deserve this disrespect
from you?

995
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:09,100
Let's look at my son Bowl.
What is my son bought to do?

996
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,280
He was meant to inherit this pizza and 
bio.

997
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,420
Pair me with that music.
You guys for Christ sake.

998
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:21,180
My son,
Beau was to inherit this pizza empire.

999
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:22,501
Oh,
seriously?

1000
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:25,390
Both lost like everything.
My son,

1001
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:29,410
he's a good boy.
He was meant to inherit this pizza.

1002
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,900
Why?
If you had to deal with his dad,

1003
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:33,790
but it was like,
at least I'm going to get this.

1004
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,970
Yes.
At least that.

1005
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:39,020
But now,
now ball is not in the house.

1006
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:43,600
Neither is the walk.
Test respect.

1007
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:48,880
Stevie,
you're my trusted colleagues now.

1008
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:53,881
I can trust you more than anyone.
You're going to remove the apostrophe.

1009
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:57,250
It's my company.
It's.

1010
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:02,720
It's in the name of my trust him brother
rather stately bop.

1011
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,730
I sit at home.
When I think about my mistakes,

1012
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:13,270
I maybe I said the n word on a 
conference.

1013
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:20,470
We've got the best pizza.
I built it with my hands and the sauce,

1014
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,370
the sauce,
Alfredo sauce,

1015
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,750
my son.
I'll Fred Fred stuff,

1016
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:36,940
and now I'm disgraced in the eyes of the
world,

1017
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:41,941
the Papa John's.
The NFL doesn't bother me.

1018
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,370
Butter,
garlic sauce.

1019
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:46,983
Phasey.
I love the butter garlic sauce and no 

1020
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:58,130
running ads on twitter.
You never portray the family.

1021
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,150
I feel for you as the Godfather,
Papa,

1022
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:13,210
John,
and now what do you.

1023
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:14,103
What's next?
You're going to rub off the fact that 

1024
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:23,710
the guy that's buying shots and know 
that you've got to get rid of the better

1025
00:58:27,581 --> 00:58:31,920
pizza,
better ingredients to serve.

1026
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:37,050
This is inheritances.
Hit me with the puppy in the house.

1027
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:43,263
Welcome.

1028
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:45,203
Well,
you book.

1029
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,220
Oh my God,
I can't do that for hours,

1030
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,590
is what they got funneled the best movie
ever.

1031
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,470
It is.
It really is.

1032
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,670
Because you've made it.
I mean,

1033
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,273
yeah,
that's really a controversial statement 

1034
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,610
too about that was really brave of you 
to come out and say that.

1035
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,490
So brave.
Nobody else agrees with that,

1036
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,730
but I'm.
You're athletic.

1037
00:59:07,731 --> 00:59:09,270
You're saying.
I'm like,

1038
00:59:09,271 --> 00:59:11,670
really the best.
Not just,

1039
00:59:11,671 --> 00:59:12,510
Oh,
it's the best.

1040
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,960
You know why it's like,
is it really the best?

1041
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,290
But I think it is.
Well,

1042
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:18,120
I'll tell you why it's the best and it's
simple.

1043
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,340
It's all,
and this is why I love Casa so much.

1044
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:27,370
It's just good acting a good story and 
that's it.

1045
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:33,220
It's pure cinematic beauty.
It's beautifully directed,

1046
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,290
acted and written.
There's no special effects.

1047
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:39,830
There's no gimmicks.
It's just beautiful cinema,

1048
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,570
you know,
and you're suck.

1049
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:46,190
Then every from scene to scene,
you are firmly and golf.

1050
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,083
I love the first,
like 20 minutes or whatever the wedding 

1051
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,960
you come to me,
Stevie us to be.

1052
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:53,930
Is that his name?
Stevie.

1053
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:55,640
Steve.
Steve,

1054
00:59:55,641 --> 00:59:58,670
you come to me on the day of my 
daughter's wedding and you ask,

1055
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,880
can you be CEO?
And I say to you,

1056
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:02,770
Steve,
Steve,

1057
01:00:02,771 --> 01:00:03,830
ricky,
Steve,

1058
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:04,693
Richie has do.
What did I do to deserve this 

1059
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:08,420
disrespect?

1060
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,960
My son,
Beau,

1061
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,360
he was teased all throughout high 
school.

1062
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:16,940
He was meant to have this path.
Right,

1063
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,820
and you'll take it from him,
but we never did anything like that.

1064
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:23,720
My son Boldo,
he was gonna.

1065
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,520
It was a pizza.
Brent's now it's pizza.

1066
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,633
You think Bowie is going to be like 
Michael and just ruthlessly to control 

1067
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:34,130
the Papa John's empire?
That'd be amazing.

1068
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:41,080
I want a three part trilogy about Papa.
Can you play that music?

1069
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,170
We just love it.
The Godfather music.

1070
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,033
Now I'm over to it.
I just want to watch the godfather 

1071
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:57,860
though.
Did we watch enough of this now?

1072
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:01,250
If you close this?
Definitely.

1073
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,860
I have some.
Shake my head.

1074
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,640
Pray for you guys to do better.
Yeah.

1075
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,270
Moving forward.
Well,

1076
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:07,330
what?
We didn't finish it.

1077
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:08,543
Oh,
I guess that's it.

1078
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:12,280
I love other posturing of like war on 
suicide watch.

1079
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:16,960
We don't have any plans or we're not 
telling you anything.

1080
01:01:16,961 --> 01:01:19,840
Just that were on suicide watch.
Yeah.

1081
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:23,320
There wasn't really a promise at the end
to do better or anything was there.

1082
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:26,020
It was just like there is something like
what?

1083
01:01:26,021 --> 01:01:28,620
The values.
You want me to open this io?

1084
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,980
Yeah,
you got it open right?

1085
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,140
Here you go.
Our core values,

1086
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:33,933
they link to this.
This is a film you want me to read this 

1087
01:01:37,931 --> 01:01:39,490
here?
Hit Me with the godfather music.

1088
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:44,990
I was appointed the CEO of Papa John's 
earlier this year.

1089
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:46,603
As the new CEO,
I want to share the values that will 

1090
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:49,574
drive the transformation of Papa John's.
I stated my career in pizza business 25 

1091
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:57,830
years ago because pizza brings people 
together.

1092
01:01:58,670 --> 01:01:59,503
Unlike that piece of shit.
Papa Johns who was brought the 

1093
01:02:02,421 --> 01:02:04,460
foundation of everything we are to the 
ground.

1094
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,660
I found a home at Papa John's where 
people from all backgrounds work side by

1095
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:12,380
side.
Every Papa Johns is 120,000

1096
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,270
corporate and franchise team members 
around the world.

1097
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,600
We stand for equity,
fairness,

1098
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,010
respect,
and

1099
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:23,490
are most important.
Ingredient is people.

1100
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:24,383
Will they have people in their pizzas?
That's kind of a revelation when I 

1101
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:33,594
became CEO.
I want to do this in the godfather 

1102
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,090
voice,
but it doesn't make sense.

1103
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:37,793
That's going to be too slow.
It's going to be when I became CEO in 

1104
01:02:39,601 --> 01:02:40,434
January in diversity,
equity and inclusion became one of my 

1105
01:02:44,671 --> 01:02:45,504
top priorities.
What began began as a committee of 

1106
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:48,834
passionate team members has grown into a
company wide effort to realize our 

1107
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:54,480
values.
He says,

1108
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:56,940
uh,
he says here,

1109
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,490
let go up.
When I became CEO,

1110
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,130
diversity equity inclusion became my top
priority.

1111
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:04,200
What about selling pies?
You fucking idiot.

1112
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,860
We run in a.
are we running the acl?

1113
01:03:08,861 --> 01:03:13,861
You or a pizza franchise?
Christ and independent cultural audit.

1114
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:17,720
I,
along with Papa John's,

1115
01:03:17,721 --> 01:03:20,670
a leader's visited Atlanta,
Los Angeles.

1116
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,270
Dallas.
He had to get.

1117
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:21,541
Yeah,
yeah,

1118
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:23,220
yeah.
Recently published leadership team,

1119
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:25,290
completed unconscious bias training.

1120
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:26,580
Wow.
That sounds vulgar.

1121
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:27,720
Uh,
recently.

1122
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:28,554
Uh,
personally committed to adding more 

1123
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:30,750
diversity.
Guys.

1124
01:03:30,751 --> 01:03:33,630
It's fucking pizza.
Just sell supplies for Christ's sake.

1125
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,464
Does anyone care?
We're assembling a special advisory 

1126
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:38,430
group comprises of nationally respected 
diversity,

1127
01:03:38,431 --> 01:03:40,830
equity,
and inclusion experts to help guide us.

1128
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:44,640
It's fucking by.
We're kicking off the development of two

1129
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,890
key longterm initiatives.
Papa John,

1130
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,090
my minority owned franchise expansion 
and development program.

1131
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,280
The fuck does that mean?
What does that mean?

1132
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,593
They're just given damp.
Papa really did a lot of damage just 

1133
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,830
given away franchises.
What did I tell?

1134
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,960
I said the n word on a conference.
Call it good that signed.

1135
01:04:13,051 --> 01:04:18,051
Sincerely.
See this trail?

1136
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,700
I will never forget.
Everyone's like,

1137
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:25,690
get on with it.
Whatever.

1138
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,660
I'm there you have it.
A heart wrenching.

1139
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:32,760
This,
the trilogy.

1140
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:33,594
Where are we in the trilogy?
Is this part two or part three was the 

1141
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:40,440
part two that was probably two or three 
poles apart.

1142
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,650
Part three is gonna suck and it's going 
to be weird.

1143
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:45,530
The new brand who's going to wear it and
everyone's just gonna.

1144
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,380
Forget about Papa.

1145
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,033
Yeah,

1146
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:49,943
you know that in the godfather when he's
like sitting outside and dies and 

1147
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:55,270
there's like the laundry's on the line 
and he's like,

1148
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:58,750
just chilling in his backyard.
Retired playing with the kids.

1149
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:00,880
That's what Papa John Shatner's doing 
right now.

1150
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,430
Not to have a heart attack and fall over
and fucking die.

1151
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:11,870
Well,
he'll always have the pizza mansion.

1152
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,263
Yeah,

1153
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:18,580
Kong.
Oh Man,

1154
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:19,620
dude,
you guys are gonna.

1155
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:22,900
Love this story.
This is honestly one of the best,

1156
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:28,140
most cold blooded fuck it and cut throat
things I've ever seen in my life.

1157
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,920
Um,
this Republican candidate for Congress,

1158
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:39,520
I'm trying to think of.
I have it backwards.

1159
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:40,691
Well,
anyway,

1160
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:41,830
this guy who's,
I don't,

1161
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:44,290
I forget whose party or what.
That doesn't really matter,

1162
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,333
but a congressman is running and his 
opponent goes to his family recruits 

1163
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:56,110
five of his siblings,
brothers and sisters,

1164
01:05:56,470 --> 01:06:01,470
and they star and this hit job 
commercial against their brother.

1165
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:07,990
Their called the uh,
go go sards.

1166
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:11,080
And um,
I'm coining a new phrase right now.

1167
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:14,500
You just got go hard because I have 
never seen.

1168
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:19,540
It's so cold blooded day.
You've got to see this.

1169
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,790
It's crazy.
Fuck me.

1170
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:27,400
So these are all his siblings just 
talking shit on him.

1171
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:29,410
And then at the end they do a little 
doop doop twist on you,

1172
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,423
closer to the congressman.
Isn't doing anything to help rural 

1173
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:34,864
America.
Paul's absolutely not working for his 

1174
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,890
district.
If they care about healthcare,

1175
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,960
they care about their children's 
healthcare.

1176
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:45,060
They would hold the family's fucked up.
They care about jobs.

1177
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:49,780
They would hold him to account if he 
actually cared about me.

1178
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:56,060
So far it doesn't say I ruined the 
surprise because yeah,

1179
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,553
I ruined the surprise for everybody by.
They'll get out of that field like you 

1180
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,520
like you've actually in that field all 
the time.

1181
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,413
Oh,
you caught me out in the field and 

1182
01:07:03,991 --> 01:07:06,270
nature.
Oh,

1183
01:07:06,271 --> 01:07:08,400
hi.
There was just in nature.

1184
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,280
Jennifer Arizona.

1185
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:13,743
I bet he'd be fighting for source of 
security for better access to 

1186
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:18,000
healthcare.
I better he.

1187
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:18,863
I bet he would be researching what is 
the most insightful water policy so 

1188
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:23,404
angry to feel the environment of Arizona
sustain itself and be successful and 

1189
01:07:28,601 --> 01:07:32,050
he's not listening to you and he's 
doesn't have your interests at heart.

1190
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,060
My name is tim goes sour.
David.

1191
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:37,030
Joan goes,
are to go.

1192
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,410
Sorry Jennifer,
go star.

1193
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:39,760
Paul goes,
here's my brother.

1194
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:42,040
My brother and I endorsed Dr.
Brill,

1195
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:43,660
Dr.
Brill wholeheartedly.

1196
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:46,390
Endorse Dr David.
Root for Congress

1197
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,320
is that fucking quote,
this guy,

1198
01:07:49,321 --> 01:07:52,620
Dr Burrell don't ever pit me against 
him.

1199
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:59,090
That guy is cold blooded and Dr David 
Brill do have have siblings.

1200
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:02,940
Did I don't know what that guy's 
technique is,

1201
01:08:02,941 --> 01:08:05,220
but he's up to some like Dr.
Brill was like,

1202
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:09,690
I'll make him an offer.
He can't refuse what?

1203
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:15,810
That's dude.
He got the first ever go sergeant.

1204
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:17,743
Go starting when your whole family,
when all of your loved ones close to 

1205
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,540
betray you.
Interesting stuff.

1206
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,950
Huh?
I love the top comment on the youtube is

1207
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:31,580
I'm the ghost or thanksgiving.
This year is going to be awkward.

1208
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,200
Yeah,
that's an understatement.

1209
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:36,350
God,
seriously.

1210
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:38,350
Someone said this is the new game of 
thrones season eight,

1211
01:08:38,351 --> 01:08:42,200
trailer Rudel.
All this shit isn't unbelievable.

1212
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:46,640
Like fuck.
Like even if you hate your brother,

1213
01:08:46,641 --> 01:08:48,650
right?
Even if you hate your brother,

1214
01:08:48,651 --> 01:08:49,484
your brother's sucks and you disagree 
with them politically and he's running 

1215
01:08:51,351 --> 01:08:53,090
for office.
I mean really?

1216
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:57,290
Are you going to go with a feature like 
five of them?

1217
01:08:57,291 --> 01:09:00,320
Not One.
That's such a bad ass,

1218
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,070
like little promotion video.
How did they even put.

1219
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:09,100
How did Dr Fucking evil put that Dr 
Brill.

1220
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:12,560
How did they even arranged that?
You know what I mean?

1221
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:13,783
Who came up with it?
They woke up with a horse head in their 

1222
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:17,510
bed.
Dr.

1223
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,630
Brill sent the mcallen card,
I'll make them an offer.

1224
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,640
They can't refuse.
This family hit me with the music.

1225
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:32,050
This goes,
you're going to start this ad.

1226
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:35,260
I thought your brother,
you may not like it.

1227
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,600
You'll understand and there'll be a time
when I will do a favor for you.

1228
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,350
It's getting tough to do that.
Your throat is saying,

1229
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:48,184
yeah.

1230
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:49,123
Where your throat is over you.
My throat is over that bit as is 

1231
01:09:52,761 --> 01:09:57,761
everyone listening the comments on this 
video,

1232
01:09:58,221 --> 01:09:59,060
right?
So funny.

1233
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:03,320
Fucking ghosts are man.
Hey.

1234
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,480
Hi Guys.
Hey Gang.

1235
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:06,410
It's me.
Dr.

1236
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,333
Brill.
So I'm running against your brother for 

1237
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:13,220
Congress and I was just hoping if you 
would all be um,

1238
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,140
available to fucking destroy your 
brother publicly and my commercial.

1239
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,290
Absolutely.
Doctor,

1240
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,280
are you a savage?
Are you,

1241
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,270
are you going to savages?
I'm a total savage.

1242
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,350
You know what?
I got to tell you,

1243
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:36,120
I don't know anything about the guy 
they're shitting on,

1244
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:37,373
but this Dr.
burdall scares the shit out and I'm not 

1245
01:10:41,011 --> 01:10:41,844
sure I want him in office because that's
the coldest shit I've ever seen in my 

1246
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:45,954
life.
Like even if you can get all the 

1247
01:10:47,641 --> 01:10:50,040
siblings to make a video about that 
twist,

1248
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:53,760
I know and it was made like artfully,
right?

1249
01:10:53,761 --> 01:10:58,560
Like Shakespearean,
like even if you could make this,

1250
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:59,423
do you really want to be that guy that 
like tore the family apart for a good 

1251
01:11:02,461 --> 01:11:04,770
political ad?
You know what I'm saying?

1252
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:06,383
It's cold.
I feel like I need the backstory of 

1253
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:13,151
what's going on in that either way.
Or is this a fucking uh,

1254
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,543
Arizona,

1255
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:17,010
those motherfuckers are crazy in 
Arizona.

1256
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:22,500
Shit,
I am Dr.

1257
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:24,300
Brill.
And if you don't vote for me,

1258
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,193
I will kill you.
I'm Dr Brill and I will kill your whole 

1259
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:32,310
family feud.
Not cast your vote for me.

1260
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:32,970
This,
uh,

1261
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:33,840
coming September.

1262
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,350
Hi,
I'm Dr Brill,

1263
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:43,760
the coldest motherfucker you've ever 
seen in your life.

1264
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:45,110
I will,
I will.

1265
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:47,900
I will not hesitate to hit those drone 
murder buttons.

1266
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:51,060
You know how there's like drones in 
Afghanistan bombing people and I endorse

1267
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:53,120
this message.
I endorse our click.

1268
01:11:53,121 --> 01:11:53,954
Those drone murder buttons so fast.
That was a huge controversy when Obama 

1269
01:11:58,701 --> 01:12:02,540
was president because he had all these 
drones in Afghanistan,

1270
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:06,590
just like dropping bombs all day,
so he's loved.

1271
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,970
Brill is loving that.
I will add.

1272
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:09,973
My name is Dr.
Brill and I pledged to drone strike 

1273
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:16,990
American citizens in the United States.
I'm cold blooded as it gets real and you

1274
01:12:22,851 --> 01:12:24,650
don't want to mess with me.
Pretty much.

1275
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,170
I am Dr.
Brill and if you run against me,

1276
01:12:27,171 --> 01:12:28,004
I will ruin your whole life and tear 
your family apart and then drone strike 

1277
01:12:30,861 --> 01:12:33,260
your house.
If I'm elected.

1278
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,680
This guy scares the shit out of me.

1279
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:41,750
Damn fucking crazy.

1280
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,770
Craziest thing I ever seen.
I mean,

1281
01:12:43,771 --> 01:12:45,150
it's like.
It's unbelievable.

1282
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:47,100
Anyway,
what else do we got?

1283
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:53,130
Next door is gone.
This is a quick one.

1284
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:56,250
I love this.
This could only have been Russia,

1285
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:01,740
woman buried and Russian graveyard is 
given a five foot high tombstone and the

1286
01:13:01,741 --> 01:13:03,600
shape of her favorite iphone.
Well,

1287
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:08,660
there you have it folks.
Apparently that's real.

1288
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:13,890
I don't believe it.
I almost don't believe it,

1289
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:18,650
but there you have it only in Russia,
right?

1290
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,830
Only in Russia.
Nowhere else in the whole world.

1291
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:26,730
Could anything like that happen?
I mean,

1292
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,190
there you have it,
rest in peace.

1293
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:35,670
They're just covered in snow and I ended
up back on the back.

1294
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:39,510
It even had its like really realistic.
It's got buttons and everything.

1295
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:42,480
Does it have a case?
It might have a case on it.

1296
01:13:42,481 --> 01:13:44,670
Yes.
There she is.

1297
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:48,210
Crushing it,
crushing it and crushing it.

1298
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:51,690
Afterlife as well.
So crazy.

1299
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,900
They didn't even have you.
What do you call it?

1300
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:55,260
The Barcode?
Yeah.

1301
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:56,790
Barcode.
Give it a scan.

1302
01:13:56,791 --> 01:13:59,120
I don't know.
Crushing it.

1303
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,450
Yeah.
This girl's amazing.

1304
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,570
So that's a really nice.
More than that.

1305
01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:04,404
I just thought it was interesting.
Apparently her father built the 

1306
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:12,531
tombstone after her death dedicated her.
That's kind of a loving act honestly.

1307
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,920
Yeah.
Um,

1308
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:19,180
can I play you something?
I get this voicemail from these fucking.

1309
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:20,303
I hate these people.
They call me sometimes twice a day and 

1310
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:27,280
they do this thing where it doesn't even
ring.

1311
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:29,830
It just goes straight to voicemail.
Right.

1312
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,020
Hold on,
let me find this fucking thing.

1313
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:37,460
And I'm telling me if you guys have 
heard this shit before or if it's just.

1314
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:41,970
I'm actually just calling to let you 
know that the business line of credit,

1315
01:14:41,971 --> 01:14:44,520
I have preapproved few lives to be 
expiring soon.

1316
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:45,683
I'm actually at the end of the year,
so as we're hearing the same exact 

1317
01:14:48,451 --> 01:14:49,284
message,
really just wanted to reach out to see 

1318
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:51,563
plants for the holidays and see if 
there's any way we can put this capital 

1319
01:14:53,671 --> 01:14:54,504
to use for you.
Give me a call if we can go over rates 

1320
01:14:56,431 --> 01:14:59,820
and terms that I have available.
I can be reached at 800,

1321
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:00,693
six zero,
nine,

1322
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:02,310
four,
seven,

1323
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:05,400
or you can simply call me back on that 
number that popped up on your phone.

1324
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,020
We'll talk soon.
Have a great day.

1325
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:08,293
God.

1326
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:09,630
Okay.

1327
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,463
Hey,
it's Rachel.

1328
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:14,340
Actually just calling to let you know 
that the business line of credit,

1329
01:15:14,341 --> 01:15:16,850
I have pre approved few lives to be 
expiring soon.

1330
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,100
What are they even say?
Usually go.

1331
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,070
No,
they usually go a good news,

1332
01:15:22,071 --> 01:15:22,904
Mr Klein,
you've been preapproved for a million 

1333
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:28,510
dollars of credit,
but it's expiring.

1334
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:30,470
It's expiring soon though.
I swear to God.

1335
01:15:30,471 --> 01:15:34,160
They've called me 100 times with a year 
and I got bad news.

1336
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,473
You 1 million leaves.
Do not call and impersonate me and open 

1337
01:15:43,031 --> 01:15:44,110
a line of credit in my name.

1338
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:50,460
I don't think they know anything about 
me except my name and number.

1339
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:56,090
Fucking assholes.
Don't call them guys now.

1340
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,590
I've wished that I hadn't played that.
What else we got?

1341
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:01,890
Oh,
your mom's house.

1342
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:07,790
This skin code.
The new board.

1343
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,490
This is how you can go through the data.
Oh,

1344
01:16:11,491 --> 01:16:13,860
that's funny.
That's a funny observation.

1345
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:17,180
You can like open a chat.
Chat Room Afterlife.

1346
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:18,780
Yeah.
Looking good.

1347
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:20,880
Go up some good.
Love your tombstone.

1348
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,560
Thank you.
Um,

1349
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:28,470
we were recently featured on Tom and 
Chris.

1350
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,353
Tom Segora and Christina p,
the courageous married news couple in 

1351
01:16:33,661 --> 01:16:36,220

Better than I married.

1352
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:38,390
And what news?
The 10 minute mark.

1353
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:42,240
Maybe.
These guys are so freaking awesome.

1354
01:16:42,241 --> 01:16:44,790
I love them so much.
They have a podcast of your mom's house.

1355
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:49,350
My Mom's house that we were on recently 
and I had so much fun.

And only h three podcasts experience.

1369

Uh,
what do we got from Mom Zang?

1370
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,270
Me and my buddy made.
Oh,

1371
01:17:34,271 --> 01:17:35,860
this is a new one.
Yeah,

1372
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:38,410
this one's a little tricky.
Let me see.

1373
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:39,700
Oh,
these are all new ones.

1374
01:17:39,701 --> 01:17:40,690
Okay.
So wait,

1375
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:43,930
how does this work?
Then you added this one at the top.

1376
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:47,410
I just added to a last night.
If you just scroll down a little bit,

1377
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,270
there'll be all the ones that you.
Uh,

1378
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:51,070
okay.
I haven't seen these ones yet,

1379
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:55,960
so I don't want to put them up yet.
A company.

1380
01:17:55,990 --> 01:18:00,990
Did you know what the Fuck God damn 
company,

1381
01:18:02,121 --> 01:18:03,070
if.
How's it going,

1382
01:18:03,071 --> 01:18:05,170
boss?
There's a group of people that don't,

1383
01:18:05,171 --> 01:18:06,004
not for 100 days.
Plus the reasons are interesting with 

1384
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:13,260
like your perspective from Ghia.
Uh,

1385
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:14,103
the no fat is a community online I have 
heard of and I'm intrigued by their 

1386
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:18,364
activities.
Now these are people that believe that 

1387
01:18:20,351 --> 01:18:23,380
by not masturbating or looking at 
pornography,

1388
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,740
they gain superhuman powers essentially.

1389
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:30,820
In fact,
I pulled up,

1390
01:18:30,821 --> 01:18:33,130
I was doing some research because I'm 
aware of the group,

1391
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:36,510
but this was one of the top post of all 
time on the no Phipps subreddit.

1392
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:37,443
And so this is what they outlined 
happens to you when you do not 

1393
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,950
masturbate.
Over the course of 10 years,

1394
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:42,784
my God,
10 years not fucking drinking your own 

1395
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:46,680
filth.
Ds Meet Anyway,

1396
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:49,540
five minutes.
Wow.

1397
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,310
I'm,
I'm five minutes.

1398
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:54,700
Your heart rate will return back to 
normal.

1399
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,740
Okay?
Two to three days.

1400
01:18:56,741 --> 01:18:58,990
Guilt and shame.
Seems like it is decreasing.

1401
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:01,630
Seven days.
Brain fog will lift.

1402
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:04,330
School will get easier for you.
Fourteen days.

1403
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,730
Prolastin also known as,
okay,

1404
01:19:06,731 --> 01:19:08,680
they're getting scientific starts to 
drop.

1405
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:12,280
Fourteen to 21 days.
Dopamine sensitivity increases.

1406
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,533
Thirty days.
Craving and flashbacks will noticeably 

1407
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,620
reduce 30 days,
60 days.

1408
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:22,300
It becomes rock solid and confidence 
keeps rising.

1409
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,100
Uh,
60 days.

1410
01:19:24,101 --> 01:19:24,934
You might stop giving a fuck what other 
people think about what it's like when 

1411
01:19:27,101 --> 01:19:32,101
your bio facial lotion or something or 
all the benefit of like write everything

1412
01:19:34,241 --> 01:19:35,980
you wish will have diamond water.

1413
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:42,370
I'm at 90 days considered a full reboot 
for most people.

1414
01:19:42,371 --> 01:19:43,750
Confident,
still rising.

1415
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,053
One hundred 50 days.
Symptoms of severe pied disappear on 

1416
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:48,130
prep.
I know what it is,

1417
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:48,964
but I liked the sound of that 200 days.
I feel like every girl wants to fuck me 

1418
01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:57,150
and I started reading a Bible of this as
far as I can tell isn't a job.

1419
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:03,550
This guy found God after 200 days a one 
year.

1420
01:20:03,551 --> 01:20:05,890
I don't even know why I was watching 
porn a year ago,

1421
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:08,760
two years now.
I have a amazing job and I've never been

1422
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:09,690
happier.
Really.

1423
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,980
They'll from not masturbating 10 years.
My life has just been amazing.

1424
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:18,981
Ever since I stopped masturbating.
I'm 10 years.

1425
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:20,773
This guy's dead serious,
which is kind of funny and a little 

1426
01:20:23,431 --> 01:20:27,990
pathetic,
but if I'm a speaking frankly,

1427
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,453
there is an interesting theory and not 
masturbating because I do think that 

1428
01:20:34,171 --> 01:20:35,004
like porn addiction is real and I do 
think that like when you look like 

1429
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:41,490
looking at porn is really unhealthy 
because you do.

1430
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:45,720
It's like when you look at porn and you 
just know any finished real fast,

1431
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:50,640
it is kind of like a high.
Like you get this like you know,

1432
01:20:50,641 --> 01:20:52,170
if you're like in a bad mood or 
whatever.

1433
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,080
A lot of guys I think rely on like a 
Kurt,

1434
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,093
a quick jerk.
I'll quick porn watch as a treatment to 

1435
01:20:59,881 --> 01:21:00,714
a bad mood.
A lot of guys or a lot of guys that 

1436
01:21:02,931 --> 01:21:03,764
know,
I think it's very common and so they'll 

1437
01:21:06,001 --> 01:21:08,340
watch some porn,
they'll jerk one out real quick and then

1438
01:21:08,341 --> 01:21:09,001
you're like,
uh,

1439
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:13,200
and then you get on with your day.
But there is really I think something to

1440
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,034
this idea that like your dopamine,
your reward levels and shit got all 

1441
01:21:18,031 --> 01:21:20,340
whacked out and it really is like an 
addiction.

1442
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:21,773
And so I do think that there is probably
some good benefits to at least not 

1443
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:27,630
looking at porn,

1444
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:30,323
but I've also read that masturbating 
daily for guys is healthy because it 

1445
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:36,060
helps prevent prostate cancer because 
you're constantly,

1446
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:37,463
you know,
pushing everything out of your tubes or 

1447
01:21:39,271 --> 01:21:40,104
if you let it sit there,
like that's how colon cancer happens to 

1448
01:21:43,171 --> 01:21:45,070
it because you don't,
the more you ship,

1449
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:48,000
the less likely you are to get colon 
cancer because you don't want that stuff

1450
01:21:48,001 --> 01:21:48,834
sitting there for so long.
It's the same theory with the a nut 

1451
01:21:53,071 --> 01:21:57,870
juice.
So I am intrigued,

1452
01:21:57,871 --> 01:22:01,500
but at the same time I'm sure that it's 
probably not that serious.

1453
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:05,760
Are you gonna know fap?
I'm in,

1454
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:07,380
I'll go.
I'll know fat for like a day.

1455
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,400
I'm already at five minutes.
My heartbeat feels pretty normal.

1456
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,870
Guilt and shame.
Definitely.

1457
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,930
That's two to three days.
So I haven't reached that level yet,

1458
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:24,020
but we all get milestones.
My,

1459
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:29,060
my best record so far is three hours.
So I don't know,

1460
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,920
I'm intrigued by it.
I'd like to hear from a no fabric.

1461
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:34,950
I'd like to take a call from somebody 
who,

1462
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:38,220
um,
who,

1463
01:22:38,221 --> 01:22:41,340
who has gone a long time without 
masturbating to Kinda hear there,

1464
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:43,800
you know,
I heard something interesting about Mike

1465
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,940
Tyson when he used to go box when he was
young,

1466
01:22:47,941 --> 01:22:49,740
like God,
like boxer,

1467
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:50,843
he wouldn't masturbate or have sex for 
like months leading up to his fight 

1468
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:56,220
because it would get them all crazy.

1469
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,580
Kind of interesting.
That's interesting.

1470
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,650
Yeah.
Um,

1471
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,180
I'm interested,
you know,

1472
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:07,070
they're called fap too,
by the way.

1473
01:23:07,071 --> 01:23:11,560
I swear to God and that's what it says 
in their fucking description.

1474
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:12,910
Yeah.
I don't know.

1475
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:16,780
Do any of you guys are back there?
Are you in any of this?

1476
01:23:16,781 --> 01:23:17,400
Into this?
No.

1477
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,490
Flapping,
definitely not.

1478
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:20,670
Absolutely not.
What about Zach and m?

1479
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:22,900
You guys?
I mean,

1480
01:23:22,901 --> 01:23:26,240
it's relaxing.
It's looks like it's all know back.

1481
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:32,510
Lots of a sheepish knows frequent 
masturbatory.

1482
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:34,690
Yes.
We all are frequent exacerbaters.

1483
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,460
I wonder how frequently do you guys 
masturbate?

1484
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:44,690
Probably like once a day and Zach and,
uh,

1485
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:48,250
in a interest that he's done it twice 
since the show started.

1486
01:23:48,251 --> 01:23:49,150
So no,
don't be.

1487
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:49,750
I want to,
I'm,

1488
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,890
I'm genuinely curious.
I'm taking a sample here,

1489
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:55,100
I'd say about,
I don't know,

1490
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:58,990
once every two days,
once every two days.

1491
01:23:58,991 --> 01:24:00,430
Every two days.
It's pretty conservative.

1492
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,050
That's conservative.
You're a young man.

1493
01:24:02,051 --> 01:24:04,990
Should be jerking off.
Like fight with Zach.

1494
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:08,650
Just turned 21 and I want to know how 
much Ian masturbates.

1495
01:24:08,651 --> 01:24:12,160
I feel like he's asleep.
He jerks like eight times a day.

1496
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:15,430
That's a little offensive.
Well,

1497
01:24:15,431 --> 01:24:16,960
how am,
to be honest,

1498
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,940
I don't know.
Forty eight hour window.

1499
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:20,920
Forty eight hour.
That's pretty responsible.

1500
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,193
I'm like once a day.
I guess when I was younger there'll be 

1501
01:24:25,511 --> 01:24:29,830
days when I was younger there'd be like 
eight times in a day.

1502
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:32,343
That wasn't like common,
but some days it's like your Dick 

1503
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:37,030
actually gets hurt.
It's like,

1504
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:38,530
Whoa Dude,
you need to get a life,

1505
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:41,350
but you have.
But we've all been there,

1506
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:42,820
right?
Nothing better to do.

1507
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:46,173
I,
I get why the people I get why these 

1508
01:24:49,161 --> 01:24:50,690
people.
I'm like,

1509
01:24:50,691 --> 01:24:51,524
you said,
you know,

1510
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:56,060
intellectually I see that there can be 
some benefit to it,

1511
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:57,920
especially with what you were saying 
about,

1512
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:01,660
you know,
relaxing your reward center and uh,

1513
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:02,583
well,
and when you jerk off in the middle of 

1514
01:25:03,921 --> 01:25:05,480
the day,
it can fuck your whole day up.

1515
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,670
You know what I mean?
Why?

1516
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:11,510
Because you just get so sleepy and lazy 
and then all of a sudden you're like,

1517
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:15,290
you just have no motivation because you 
jerked off in the middle of the day.

1518
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:16,124
It's like,
and you're,

1519
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,120
you know what I mean?
It's like,

1520
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:18,380
what do you,
where do you go from there?

1521
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:20,670
Take a nap.
I don't know.

1522
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:23,590
No fat.
I'm intrigued.

1523
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:25,780
Good question.
Thank you.

1524
01:25:25,781 --> 01:25:26,650
Gift for that.
Uh,

1525
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,930
enlightening.
Vigorous debate.

1526
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,720
Thank you.
And God bless Ya.

1527
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:36,490
Next up from pee Layton,
I work in the vape industry and I always

1528
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:39,070
listen to your podcasts while I'm here 
as a fellow member of the nation.

1529
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:43,510
I would love to hear any commentary you 
guys have on the new FDA regulations for

1530
01:25:43,511 --> 01:25:44,344
vaping products in regards to packaging 
and advertisings and the law to ban 

1531
01:25:48,461 --> 01:25:52,870
flavors and the epidemic of teen vaping.
Sincerely,

1532
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:58,080
xxx vape wizard for 20 x x x Hashtag 
[inaudible] a great question.

1533
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:04,040
So the FDA,
this is

1534
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,100
actually quite interesting and then you 
would know about this because it affects

1535
01:26:07,101 --> 01:26:12,101
you directly,
is that the FDA is banning flavored vape

1536
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,590
juices because they say it appeals to 
kids.

1537
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:19,933
That is pretty much par for the course 
of my pain because they did the same 

1538
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:23,143
thing to alcohol and tobacco where they 
really restricted how they could market 

1539
01:26:28,401 --> 01:26:31,310
it because they didn't want it to appeal
to kids.

1540
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:36,550
And frankly I do feel like vaping has 
become a really severe gateway drug.

1541
01:26:38,931 --> 01:26:41,060
I don't know if you want to say gay or 
whatever,

1542
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,163
but I haven't seen it firsthand,
but I've heard that a lot of kids in 

1543
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:46,034
like middle school and high school,
I walk around with these tiny little 

1544
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:50,600
vape pen and actually smoking,
um,

1545
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:51,643
which I find pretty wild because it's 
almost like everybody stopped smoking 

1546
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:56,600
cigarettes.
They're all like,

1547
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:00,200
we all understand it's not cool.
It's really bad for you.

1548
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:02,263
But now it's almost like there's a new 
problem where super accessible and 

1549
01:27:05,691 --> 01:27:06,441
everyone's like,
oh,

1550
01:27:06,441 --> 01:27:08,090
it's not as bad.
So it's okay.

1551
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:11,750
I think we don't really know how bad it 
is yet.

1552
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:14,450
Maybe it's not that bad.
Maybe it's not.

1553
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,440
Maybe it is.
I don't know,

1554
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:19,400
but I think it's probably a good idea 
that,

1555
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:20,234
uh,

1556
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:23,100
what the fuck do I know,

1557
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:25,383
Dan?
What do you think?

1558
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:27,453
I mean,
I'm really of two minds of it because 

1559
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,570
I'm on the one hand,
you know,

1560
01:27:31,571 --> 01:27:32,404
I,
I think,

1561
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,700
you know,
obviously it's bad.

1562
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:36,550
I don't know how prevalent it really is 
with kids.

1563
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,393
Like,
is it more than when we were in high 

1564
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:41,140
school kids smoking cigarettes?

1565
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:44,280
Apparently it's,
it is extremely.

1566
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,020
Uh,
it's,

1567
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:49,980
it's very,
it's like overwhelming from,

1568
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:50,960
from what I understand.
Again,

1569
01:27:50,961 --> 01:27:51,794
I'm,
I'm not

1570
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,340
so,
I mean present that that is,

1571
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:58,030
that is probably not good admittedly.
But is it,

1572
01:27:58,530 --> 01:28:00,370
I mean,
banning the flavors,

1573
01:28:00,371 --> 01:28:02,290
is that really gonna do anything to 
prevent that?

1574
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:05,970
You think like it's really specific 
flavors,

1575
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:10,980
like a Unicorn.
What I remember when I was a kid,

1576
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:14,320
I would go,
whenever we come to la,

1577
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:15,303
my mom would take me to this candy store
that I loved and the one candy I would 

1578
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:18,933
always get,
I loved it so much was bubble gum 

1579
01:28:21,111 --> 01:28:21,944
cigarettes,
you believe this and it was gum wrapped 

1580
01:28:24,881 --> 01:28:25,714
in like they had a bunch of powdered 
sugar so you could go and it would puff 

1581
01:28:31,511 --> 01:28:32,860
out sugar.
I think.

1582
01:28:32,861 --> 01:28:33,694
I know that it was so cool smoking a 
cigarette and I think I forgot that 

1583
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:40,570
existed and I used to love it too.
Yeah,

1584
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,090
I logged it as a kid and looking back on
that,

1585
01:28:43,091 --> 01:28:43,751
it's like,
Whoa,

1586
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:47,200
that's pretty fucked up.
That was my favorite.

1587
01:28:47,201 --> 01:28:49,360
I will go get it.
And I thought was so cool.

1588
01:28:49,361 --> 01:28:52,210
Every time.
Those are not sure.

1589
01:28:52,211 --> 01:28:53,700
Those are band.
Yeah.

1590
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,020
I love so.
I Dunno.

1591
01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:57,790
I don't know.
What the hell do I know?

1592
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:02,430
Thanks for the question.
A half priced teddy,

1593
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:07,650
teddy friends because you ain't getting 
no half off.

1594
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:11,250
Right?
It was full price.

1595
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,411
Yeah,
half price.

1596
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:16,050
Did A.
Hey,

1597
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:17,760
my name's Josh.
Had been a huge fan.

1598
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:21,990
You guys are the best youtube channel.
Best Channel on Youtube.

1599
01:29:21,991 --> 01:29:24,210
Thank you.
And you know,

1600
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:27,840
I mean,
thank you so much.

1601
01:29:27,841 --> 01:29:29,200
Tell me more.
Uh,

1602
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:30,420
well,
not the biggest trend.

1603
01:29:30,421 --> 01:29:32,580
I was wondering,
have you ever heard of a movement called

1604
01:29:32,581 --> 01:29:33,414
stop a douchebag?
It's a movement in Russia in which a 

1605
01:29:34,831 --> 01:29:38,670
group of people stop others from parking
and illegal places such as sidewalks,

1606
01:29:38,671 --> 01:29:39,504
railroads by approaching them carefully.
Sometimes they will blow up with huge 

1607
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:45,570
amounts of ignorance and other will move
straight to physical violence.

1608
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,690
If they don't comply then they get a 
huge sticker on their windshield.

1609
01:29:48,691 --> 01:29:51,030
They have a nice amount of subs.
And was wondering what you guys think.

1610
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,253
Does this solution even work?
This is productive or should there be 

1611
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:56,640
other actions taken?
Just curious.

1612
01:29:57,570 --> 01:29:59,190
Thank you for the kind words,
Josh.

1613
01:29:59,191 --> 01:30:01,500
I believe he had said,
and if I can quote him,

1614
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:06,620
you are by far the best channel on 
Youtube from Josh half-priced.

1615
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:07,703
Ted,
you are by far the best channel on 

1616
01:30:08,851 --> 01:30:10,290
Youtube.
He said about us.

1617
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:12,000
Um,
thank you for that.

1618
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:13,740
So let's go.
Actually,

1619
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:15,120
yeah,
I do know about these guys.

1620
01:30:15,121 --> 01:30:18,240
Stop a douchebag and actually pulled up 
the video and we can watch it together.

1621
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,890
Oh,
okay.

1622
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,690
Once I have a quick look here.
Yeah.

1623
01:30:24,691 --> 01:30:29,691
So I mean apparently in Russia it's a 
little more like a medieval.

1624
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:36,330
Like motherfuckers just,
you see the shit,

1625
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,770
they're crazy.
There's traffic and there's limited.

1626
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,250
So just hopping up on the sidewalk,
it's a little more,

1627
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,670
it's a little more lawless probably in 
some places in Russia.

1628
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:49,080
So these guys are vigilantes and they're
like,

1629
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,200
this is fucked up.
[inaudible] cities.

1630
01:30:52,201 --> 01:30:53,830
Our sidewalk don't,
you know,

1631
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,280
don't drive on the sidewalk is 
dangerous.

1632
01:30:56,281 --> 01:30:57,114
Right.
So they call it stop a douchebag and 

1633
01:30:58,981 --> 01:31:01,500
they were taking vigilante justice into 
their own hands,

1634
01:31:01,501 --> 01:31:03,000
just like Batman essentially.

1635
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:08,180
Can I ask you why you parked your bus on
the sidewalk?

1636
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:09,103
Okay.

1637
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:12,860
Uh,
he says it's a service bus.

1638
01:31:13,030 --> 01:31:16,280
What the service bus.
I can't hear you.

1639
01:31:16,281 --> 01:31:17,114
Unfortunately.
We are waiting for some people to get 

1640
01:31:20,121 --> 01:31:21,140
on.
Okay.

1641
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:22,123
Well,
could you move your bus at least you 

1642
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:29,140
parked right on the sidewalk.
People push their shopping carts here.

1643
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:37,910
He doesn't seem to give a fuck.
You won't be able to get around.

1644
01:31:37,911 --> 01:31:42,200
Or can you move your truck please?
Thank you.

1645
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:44,510
And they're asking the guy and he does 
so there you have it,

1646
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:48,480
vigilante justice,
but sometimes the

1647
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:51,250
blurred defined and I guess that's when 
it gets a little while.

1648
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:53,703
Um,
there's a Mercedes that's on the 

1649
01:31:56,271 --> 01:31:57,260
sidewalk.
They stop him.

1650
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:59,800
He said,
oh,

1651
01:31:59,801 --> 01:32:00,160
the guy

1652
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,630
says this won't happen again.
I'm late.

1653
01:32:01,631 --> 01:32:02,710
I'm sorry.
Okay.

1654
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:03,843
Back your car please.
They say it's almost like catch a 

1655
01:32:08,501 --> 01:32:10,420
Predator vibe.
It's like,

1656
01:32:10,421 --> 01:32:12,790
I wonder if they know these guys in 
Russia because he's like,

1657
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:13,624
oh,
you caught me at will never happen 

1658
01:32:14,231 --> 01:32:16,450
again.
I'm going to pull out.

1659
01:32:16,451 --> 01:32:16,721
No,
no,

1660
01:32:16,721 --> 01:32:18,220
no.
Back up there saying you can't.

1661
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:19,083
They're not letting them

1662
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:24,070
pull out there making them back up.
I know all people are equal.

1663
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:26,170
All must drive back.
So they send this guy back.

1664
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:29,090
The guy knew what was good for a man.
Well,

1665
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:32,740
let's see if this guy does.
This guy is not having that.

1666
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:33,670
I could tell you right now,

1667
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:35,473
sky was kind of sheepish.
He was like kind of on the road on the 

1668
01:32:37,911 --> 01:32:38,744
sidewalk.
This guy is fully occupying the 

1669
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:43,100
sidewalk.
There's a huge line of traffic.

1670
01:32:43,101 --> 01:32:43,960
And this guy's driving on this

1671
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:46,800
sidewalk.
I'm running late,

1672
01:32:46,801 --> 01:32:48,390
she says,
for a friend's wedding.

1673
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:50,203
Understand,
but can you please back to the roadway 

1674
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,160
guys?
I need to be at the river.

1675
01:32:53,161 --> 01:32:56,060
Go station 20 minutes,
Yada Yada.

1676
01:32:56,061 --> 01:32:59,930
At sidewalk on lake.
Do you relative.

1677
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:01,560
You're on a footpath for the blind right
now.

1678
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:04,890
I do understand,
but sometimes things come up.

1679
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,570
She said,
oh,

1680
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:09,510
everyone's been really polite.
No.

1681
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:10,561
Oh,
she went around.

1682
01:33:10,561 --> 01:33:12,740
I was just running around them.
Oh,

1683
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,350
are they going to catch up to her?
So she drew.

1684
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:19,670
Oh really?
So they're chasing after she went around

1685
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:23,100
them and book that out.
And so what they do,

1686
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:28,050
they have these giant stickers that 
probably fucks their whole week up.

1687
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:29,423
And I guess what it says in Russian is,
I'm a Douche bag and it's this huge 

1688
01:33:33,921 --> 01:33:36,360
sticker.
The covers the windshield,

1689
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:38,520
the windshield.
So they pretty much can't drive.

1690
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:41,010
I gotta say they gave them a fair 
chance.

1691
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,530
It's very vigilante justice.
Let's see how she reacts.

1692
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:48,630
You take that thing off.
Oh my God just keeps driving.

1693
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:49,523
They put it on the passenger side.
They usually put it over the driver's 

1694
01:33:51,181 --> 01:33:51,990
side.
I think,

1695
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:52,823
let's see,

1696
01:33:56,740 --> 01:34:01,740
we've got another one.
Oh,

1697
01:34:03,961 --> 01:34:05,560
there's two.
There's several cars.

1698
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:08,660
That whole line.
The day stop a douchebag.

1699
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:10,260
Boom in here.
Just as himself.

1700
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:14,940
Could you back out of your car please?
And there's actually a car behind him.

1701
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:16,753
Stop.
Or I'll put a sticker on your 

1702
01:34:17,161 --> 01:34:18,270
windshield.
Oh,

1703
01:34:18,271 --> 01:34:19,280
he's,
he's pulling.

1704
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,660
He's driving into them.
Trying to run them over.

1705
01:34:21,661 --> 01:34:22,494
It.
Stopped there saying I'm going to put a 

1706
01:34:23,371 --> 01:34:26,670
sticker on your windshield.
I'm going to give you fucker stickier.

1707
01:34:26,671 --> 01:34:29,130
Now they put it.
So

1708
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,333
got it,
got it.

1709
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,440
Okay.
Now this is great.

1710
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:35,200
By the way,
is this 23 million views?

1711
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,420
So they put the sticker over the 
passenger side window.

1712
01:34:38,421 --> 01:34:39,254
So there's really no way for him to 
drive until he gets off on the driver's 

1713
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,460
side.
The driver's side.

1714
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:47,740
So yeah,
this guy's totally fucked.

1715
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:48,910
So he's getting out of his car though.

1716
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:53,050
He's not happy.
And he's got.

1717
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:55,180
He's got cargo,
military pants on,

1718
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:57,483
he's throwing a sandals out.
He's getting ready to kick some ass in 

1719
01:34:59,461 --> 01:35:03,810
those sandals.
This guy scared what's going on?

1720
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:07,060
This guy's fucking scaring me.
Let me grab the knife.

1721
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:08,200
Oh,
he's got a weapon.

1722
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:11,920
He's got like a nunchuck what the funder
was nunchucks what?

1723
01:35:11,921 --> 01:35:13,660
They'll get the fuck out of here.
Ugly motherfucker.

1724
01:35:13,661 --> 01:35:15,070
Where do I go?
Oh,

1725
01:35:15,071 --> 01:35:15,904
he took his nun,
chuck and threw it in the woods because 

1726
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:17,644
it's like 20 years.

1727
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:19,213
Oh man,

1728
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:25,720
he's trying to get the sticker off,
but it's not really coming off now.

1729
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:26,990
This guy days.
Fuck,

1730
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:29,423
I don't care where I'm driving and you 
see my fucking tag skylight mafia or 

1731
01:35:34,891 --> 01:35:38,810
something.
And these guys are hardcore.

1732
01:35:38,811 --> 01:35:39,644
I've got to say.

1733
01:35:39,730 --> 01:35:43,270
I know that there's like a lot of mafia 
ties in Russia.

1734
01:35:43,271 --> 01:35:44,890
So I,
I,

1735
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,380
these guys are pretty brave.
I would say to do this.

1736
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:48,820
I mean,
I don't know much about Russia.

1737
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:51,310
Even regardless,
wouldn't the Mafia.

1738
01:35:51,311 --> 01:35:53,860
There's just,
you never know this guy could have a gun

1739
01:35:53,861 --> 01:35:57,340
in just or nunchuck in this case they 
stood their ground man.

1740
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:58,810
And these are,
these are brave kids.

1741
01:35:58,811 --> 01:36:01,930
I think there's a brave kids doing a 
valuable public service.

1742
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:02,793
That's my take from this right now.
And that's what the sticker is a pretty 

1743
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,390
innocent but strong way of being like,
fuck you.

1744
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:12,720
And they also give every they to take it
off.

1745
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:17,620
Don't goof off the only way.
But what I like about them,

1746
01:36:17,621 --> 01:36:19,660
if they don't immediately throw the 
sticker on,

1747
01:36:19,661 --> 01:36:20,494
they say,
hey,

1748
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:23,920
we're here to keep peace on the 
sidewalk.

1749
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:26,140
Can you please back up?
And if they do,

1750
01:36:26,141 --> 01:36:30,340
they don't fuck with their car.
So I think these guys have struck a good

1751
01:36:30,341 --> 01:36:32,080
balance of vigilante justice here.

1752
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:39,210
Saying,
man,

1753
01:36:39,211 --> 01:36:40,044
that guy is so fun to drive.
His whole view was obstructed and he 

1754
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:47,850
continues to try to drive forward 
getting more stickers.

1755
01:36:47,851 --> 01:36:48,684
So he continues to try to drive more and
they're putting more stickers on his 

1756
01:36:52,441 --> 01:36:56,310
windshield and they're actually laying 
on the front of the car.

1757
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:58,620
They have.
This guy's having a fucked up day.

1758
01:36:58,621 --> 01:36:59,550
Oh,
there's someone else in the car.

1759
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:02,750
Oh girl was wipes in the car.
Imagine being natural.

1760
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:05,120
Yeah.
Wow.

1761
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,860
This guy.
This is some shit.

1762
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,420
He's getting out.
He's getting angry now.

1763
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:12,570
Oh,
he punches now.

1764
01:37:12,571 --> 01:37:14,700
They're throwing punches.
Here we go.

1765
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:17,310
Oh Man.
These vigilante.

1766
01:37:17,311 --> 01:37:20,040
Poke him out.
Let me help you up.

1767
01:37:20,490 --> 01:37:22,260
Well,
that's a humiliation.

1768
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:24,960
Wow.
That was.

1769
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,320
That was amazing.
The guy came out through applying,

1770
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,200
now they've got this one huge ass like 
you know in rocky,

1771
01:37:31,201 --> 01:37:33,420
they have like the super like USSR,
boxer.

1772
01:37:33,421 --> 01:37:36,600
They got one of these guys.
He's like the guy that confronts.

1773
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:39,930
So this guy came out,
threw a punch and Ivan Drago,

1774
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:44,070
Ivan Drago basically body dropped him 
and then he's like,

1775
01:37:44,071 --> 01:37:44,904
here,
let me help you up to complete the 

1776
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:48,120
humiliation.
Wow.

1777
01:37:48,150 --> 01:37:49,080
This guy's days.
Fuck.

1778
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,290
There's three stickers on it.

1779
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:53,793
I wonder who's.
I wonder what the police say when they 

1780
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:55,624
come.

1781
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:58,020
Oh,
here's what the sticker says.

1782
01:37:58,050 --> 01:37:59,970
It says,
I spit on everyone.

1783
01:37:59,971 --> 01:38:02,730
I drive where I want.
Stop a Douche bag.

1784
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,190
That's what it says in Russian.
Hmm.

1785
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,390
Wow.
That's amazing stuff,

1786
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:11,820
man.
These kids are brave and they're doing a

1787
01:38:11,821 --> 01:38:13,650
valued publix.
That's a really cool.

1788
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:18,210
Cool.
Thank you to Josh,

1789
01:38:18,211 --> 01:38:22,920
who by the way said you are by far my 
favorite channel on Youtube.

1790
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:28,180
So shout out to Josh.
I'm Matt Duncan's one that we.

1791
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:31,480
Yeah,
I wasn't sure what.

1792
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:32,611
That's all right.
I'm gonna.

1793
01:38:32,611 --> 01:38:35,190
Move on.
Matt says,

1794
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:37,083
there was another bathroom habit I did 
that I realized was normal seven years 

1795
01:38:39,271 --> 01:38:40,104
ago.
I was talking to members of my tennis 

1796
01:38:42,601 --> 01:38:47,460
team in my freshman year of college.
Whenever I used a Urinal or went pee,

1797
01:38:47,461 --> 01:38:51,990
I would always whip out my balls along 
with my penis to peep.

1798
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,333
I would pull the waistband under my 
balls and that always felt more 

1799
01:38:56,761 --> 01:38:59,790
comfortable and natural and when I 
brought it up to my teammates,

1800
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:02,880
I realized I was the only one that did 
that among the team.

1801
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:03,923
I was so embarrassed and I have since 
changed my habits and I do not whip out 

1802
01:39:07,351 --> 01:39:09,360
my balls anymore to pee,
but I miss it.

1803
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:10,763
Is this normal?
Do you whip out your balls to p or just 

1804
01:39:12,751 --> 01:39:14,340
your.
Your Rod as well?

1805
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:15,420
I would love your thoughts.
Well,

1806
01:39:15,421 --> 01:39:20,190
Matt,
I'm so happy that you brought this to me

1807
01:39:20,191 --> 01:39:25,191
because I feel like here at the podcast 
we're smashing taboos.

1808
01:39:26,290 --> 01:39:27,123
We are bringing things out to light that
people don't talk about and we are 

1809
01:39:29,911 --> 01:39:34,911
normalizing behaviors that are normal 
and good and just now before I get it,

1810
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,170
now before I get into that,
all I want to say that we've converted a

1811
01:39:40,171 --> 01:39:41,004
lot of people.
A lot of people have been shamed to 

1812
01:39:42,721 --> 01:39:44,880
wiping their ass from the back,
which is clownish.

1813
01:39:44,881 --> 01:39:46,350
It's ridiculous.
It's not convenient.

1814
01:39:46,351 --> 01:39:47,184
It's not as good.
A lot of people have taken the time at 

1815
01:39:49,711 --> 01:39:50,544
home to sit and cut their balls and 
pianists in their hand and to scoop 

1816
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:55,553
under while sitting comfortably with the
other hand and they found that that's a 

1817
01:39:59,450 --> 01:40:00,750
superior method.

1818
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:03,720
Now,
I'm not going to tell you right now that

1819
01:40:03,721 --> 01:40:04,554
the front way is superior even though 
you have to be a fucking cave man to 

1820
01:40:06,961 --> 01:40:07,794
stand up and squat and reach behind your
ass and wipe side decided to clean your 

1821
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:11,970
asshole.
I'm not going to tell you that.

1822
01:40:11,971 --> 01:40:14,010
I think once we pick out,
I'm just.

1823
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:14,873
What I am saying is that I don't think 
that US front wipers need to be 

1824
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:19,583
ostracized.
I don't think we need to be outcast and 

1825
01:40:21,871 --> 01:40:24,720
demean because we approach problems 
differently.

1826
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:27,960
Now I come to this issue of whipping the
balls out.

1827
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,550
Now,
this sweet young man,

1828
01:40:29,551 --> 01:40:32,100
Matt was,
he was,

1829
01:40:32,101 --> 01:40:34,200
um,
you know,

1830
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,380
he was,
he was ridiculed by his teammates.

1831
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:38,940
Well,
let me tell you,

1832
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:39,774
Matt,
I always take my balls out fucking 

1833
01:40:42,481 --> 01:40:44,970
proudly and you know why you take your 
balls out and Matt,

1834
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:48,210
because you're smart and you know what,
what makes sense?

1835
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:49,763
Now if you just take your dick out,
you've got nothing to rest your pants 

1836
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:54,490
on.
Now you're probably like me.

1837
01:40:54,491 --> 01:40:57,790
You use a waste.
It works with the elastic waist.

1838
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:01,660
If you're wearing an elastic waist pants
like I often do,

1839
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:06,460
you put the waste under your balls 
because if you just take your dick out,

1840
01:41:06,610 --> 01:41:10,210
you have to hold.
It looks ridiculous.

1841
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:13,300
It's like a little tick tack peeking 
over a fucking Mole Hill.

1842
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:17,380
You need to take the balls out.
You got to let it all breathe and that's

1843
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:19,750
an important thing and I personally find
it superior.

1844
01:41:19,930 --> 01:41:20,321
Now,
Matt,

1845
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:24,450
don't let people tell you that you're 
not that.

1846
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:25,293
That's not the right way to do it 
because that's just the absolute 

1847
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:27,963
outright disgusting criminal conspiracy.
Live to deep state line when I won't 

1848
01:41:32,201 --> 01:41:35,920
stand for you.
Take your balls out along with your Dick

1849
01:41:35,921 --> 01:41:36,950
and now everyone is homes.

1850
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:37,840
I'm like,
oh no,

1851
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:39,400
I'm going to try that.
And then you're going to find out,

1852
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:40,840
oh,
I like taking my balls out.

1853
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:44,680
They'll do wrong with it.
It was all good guys backstage.

1854
01:41:44,681 --> 01:41:49,681
Do you take your balls out?
You know what it kind of depends on,

1855
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:52,810
on.
It depends on what you're wearing.

1856
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:56,310
It's situational highly situations and 
the others,

1857
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:00,293
if you're wearing jeans into the mic,
you really have no option if you wear 

1858
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:05,420
jeans shirt.
But if you're wearing like a,

1859
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:07,320
like a basketball shorts than.
Yeah,

1860
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:08,590
absolutely.
There you go.

1861
01:42:08,591 --> 01:42:09,880
You see that?
There you go.

1862
01:42:09,881 --> 01:42:14,881
And Ian finally never.
Well in.

1863
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:19,310
You don't have to strike that tone.
I'm trying to encourage young masculine.

1864
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:20,823
Tone it down,
right?

1865
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:26,280
Not that serious in his balls aren't 
coming out.

1866
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:28,990
Yeah,
they're not coming.

1867
01:42:28,991 --> 01:42:29,824
They're staying in there.
Thank you matt for the question and I 

1868
01:42:31,811 --> 01:42:36,130
wish you all the best in life and all of
your bowl whipping out journeys.

1869
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:41,110
And finally from cow.
First of all,

1870
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:43,720
I want to say how much I love you guys 
and everything that you do.

1871
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:44,680
Well,
thank you very much.

1872
01:42:44,681 --> 01:42:45,514
Cow A cow.
I love you guys and everything that you 

1873
01:42:49,061 --> 01:42:50,260
do.
Thank you [inaudible].

1874
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:53,073
Love to hear that and that through you.
I found a ton of other creators and 

1875
01:42:57,131 --> 01:42:58,960
content that I would never have all my 
own.

1876
01:42:58,990 --> 01:42:59,823
That being said,
I want to see Ethan kind of a personal 

1877
01:43:00,971 --> 01:43:01,804
question.
How are you capable of confirming and 

1878
01:43:03,611 --> 01:43:04,990
admitting you were depressed?
Oh,

1879
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:09,760
I want to answer this,
but I feel like it's an awful way to end

1880
01:43:09,761 --> 01:43:12,910
the show.
We were just having a good time with the

1881
01:43:12,911 --> 01:43:15,370
balls out.
We can do it next time.

1882
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:16,660
Yeah,
I will say that for next time.

1883
01:43:16,661 --> 01:43:18,910
I do want to answer this.
He says I'll just finish.

1884
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:20,313
Currently,
I'm sort of a social stigma at my 

1885
01:43:21,311 --> 01:43:22,144
university that depression is a choice 
and a sign of weakness and I know that 

1886
01:43:25,091 --> 01:43:25,924
I'm definitely not happy.
How do you detect this and how are you 

1887
01:43:27,761 --> 01:43:30,820
dealing with it currently if you don't 
feel comfortable answering?

1888
01:43:30,821 --> 01:43:32,710
Well I do.
I'll answer it.

1889
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:35,770
I think I can answer it without being 
like super depressing.

1890
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:39,130
I agree.
When I was in college there was a really

1891
01:43:39,131 --> 01:43:39,964
big stigma about being depressed and I'm
sure I was depressed at the time and I 

1892
01:43:44,411 --> 01:43:47,320
think it's really well.
I think it's changed,

1893
01:43:47,321 --> 01:43:48,154
but it's really fucked up because I 
remember at my college dorm there was a 

1894
01:43:51,771 --> 01:43:52,130
sign

1895
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:57,130
on the wall with like Prozac and it was 
some kind of insinuation that like,

1896
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:00,620
um,
if you take it your week or something or

1897
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:01,633
not,
that was the subtext because it was 

1898
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:07,541
really like a how fucked up is society 
that everybody's taking Prozac.

1899
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:10,160
Right.
And then sinuation is like,

1900
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:11,240
oh,
you don't need that shit.

1901
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:15,810
I wasn't on anything like that.
But um,

1902
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,300
I agreed.
I saw that and I was like,

1903
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:19,580
Oh yeah,
everyone's on drugs,

1904
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:21,670
you know?
Um,

1905
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:26,120
the idea of treating depression was 
something like a.

1906
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:28,940
yeah,
it was very stigma.

1907
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:31,390
It was like,
like I said in the uptivity,

1908
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:35,000
it's not sexy to be depressed.
It's like it's pathetic.

1909
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:37,350
Just sounds pathetic.
Like there's two kinds of price.

1910
01:44:37,410 --> 01:44:40,790
They're like everyone is depressed and 
then there's like the real,

1911
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:45,940
the real depressed in his treatment.
And maybe people just like combine it.

1912
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,010
The people who.

1913
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:52,310
Yeah,
well the people who,

1914
01:44:52,730 --> 01:44:53,563
everyone gets depressed sometimes,
but people who get depressed sometimes 

1915
01:44:57,231 --> 01:45:00,770
don't understand what it's like to be 
depressed for two years.

1916
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:03,920
So that's why I think there was a 
disconnect there.

1917
01:45:03,921 --> 01:45:04,700
It's just,
it's a,

1918
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:07,410
it's a,
it's just a disconnect.

1919
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:11,690
It's a misunderstanding.
But be that as it may,

1920
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:14,450
you know,
I think I've been depressed for a really

1921
01:45:14,451 --> 01:45:15,284
long time and I remember I always,
I always knew that I had really severe 

1922
01:45:19,431 --> 01:45:20,264
anxiety.
I mean I was diagnosed with generalized 

1923
01:45:21,711 --> 01:45:24,740
anxiety disorder when I went off to 
college and it was like really crippling

1924
01:45:24,741 --> 01:45:28,670
all throughout college.
And I had accepted that I had a problem.

1925
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:32,480
But I remember the first time when we 
were living in Israel,

1926
01:45:32,481 --> 01:45:33,890
I saw a psychiatrist.

1927
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:36,150
Okay.

1928
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:40,750
Um,
because of my anxiety was really bad,

1929
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:42,453
or maybe I was,
I was having some kind of weird thing 

1930
01:45:44,021 --> 01:45:47,980
and I just wanted to talk to a therapist
and he had said,

1931
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:48,821
I told him,
yeah,

1932
01:45:48,821 --> 01:45:51,790
it was a therapist and I was talking 
about my symptoms and I was like,

1933
01:45:52,450 --> 01:45:54,270
you know,
I'm anxious and I,

1934
01:45:54,271 --> 01:45:56,920
there's this one thing that I get all 
the time that I still get,

1935
01:45:57,430 --> 01:46:01,540
which is that I get like foggy brain and
I feel like not myself.

1936
01:46:01,541 --> 01:46:05,050
I feel like I'm having a bad high.
And um,

1937
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,810
I really hate that feeling.
So awful.

1938
01:46:08,350 --> 01:46:10,300
And then the therapist was like,
oh,

1939
01:46:10,301 --> 01:46:11,350
so,
um,

1940
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:15,430
it sounds like you have depression.
And that shocked me.

1941
01:46:15,431 --> 01:46:17,530
I was almost offended.
I was like,

1942
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:18,400
I don't.
I'm like,

1943
01:46:18,430 --> 01:46:19,920
I have anxiety,
not depression.

1944
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:23,560
I was actually genuinely defensive and I
was like,

1945
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:24,520
what?
Like fuck,

1946
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:25,600
like fuck you,
I don't have,

1947
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:27,010
I'm,
I have anxiety.

1948
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,990
And my reaction was very much like,
like,

1949
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:35,970
fuck you dude.
And uh,

1950
01:46:35,971 --> 01:46:36,804
that was like,
that must've been like seven years ago 

1951
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:42,513
probably.
It was when we were living in Ramat Gan 

1952
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:48,720
gun and I've never treated it or 
anything like,

1953
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:53,400
um,
but

1954
01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:57,800
I've been like desperate enough where I 
was like,

1955
01:46:57,830 --> 01:46:59,000
oh,
I need some fucking help.

1956
01:46:59,001 --> 01:47:01,810
And so that's why I want to talk to that
guy and I'm,

1957
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:04,643
yeah,
I just remember being really defensive 

1958
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:09,520
and uh,
that's.

1959
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:10,413
And that,
that was so long ago and now it's come 

1960
01:47:12,491 --> 01:47:13,324
to the point where I've slowly kind of 
realized that like my anxiety has given 

1961
01:47:17,101 --> 01:47:19,900
away at that.
It's morphed into something else.

1962
01:47:19,901 --> 01:47:24,750
Like in college,
my anxiety was just this crippling a,

1963
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:29,670
I don't know.
Well,

1964
01:47:29,671 --> 01:47:30,504
it's free.
It's frequent that anxiety and 

1965
01:47:31,771 --> 01:47:34,180
depression go hand in hand,
you know?

1966
01:47:35,190 --> 01:47:39,720
And so yeah,
the more I thought about it and the more

1967
01:47:39,721 --> 01:47:40,554
time I had to accept that,
I realized that it was probably at this 

1968
01:47:43,801 --> 01:47:45,660
point more depression than there is 
anxiety.

1969
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:48,513
It's kind of like I addressed the 
anxiety because I accepted that that's 

1970
01:47:52,111 --> 01:47:52,950
what I had.
And so,

1971
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,260
but the depression,
I was so,

1972
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:59,820
I didn't want to have it so bad that I 
ignored it and never addressed it.

1973
01:47:59,821 --> 01:48:00,654
And so now I feel like I'm,
now I'm really accepting it after 

1974
01:48:07,291 --> 01:48:09,840
looking back and thinking how I feel.
I mean,

1975
01:48:09,841 --> 01:48:10,920
look at the,
um,

1976
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:13,050
just read the symptoms,
man.

1977
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:14,130
For me it's like,
yes,

1978
01:48:14,131 --> 01:48:14,521
yes,
yes,

1979
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:14,851
yes,
yes,

1980
01:48:14,851 --> 01:48:15,211
yes,
yes,

1981
01:48:15,211 --> 01:48:16,044
yes.
Like,

1982
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,800
let me read this off.
Like if I go there now,

1983
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:24,610
but it's like,
you know,

1984
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:27,700
I'm here.
Let me see.

1985
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:31,840
This shit was like fucking 100 percent.
Yes.

1986
01:48:32,650 --> 01:48:37,650
I'm just trying to find this list of uh,
symptoms come up for fuck sake.

1987
01:48:44,110 --> 01:48:47,500
Um,
let's see.

1988
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:50,830
Some signs you might have depression,
sad,

1989
01:48:50,831 --> 01:48:52,000
empty,
anxious,

1990
01:48:52,990 --> 01:48:55,540
helpless,
worthless or guilty or hopeless,

1991
01:48:55,570 --> 01:48:56,403
irritable,

1992
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:01,600
less interested in activities,
less energetic.

1993
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:04,570
Trouble concentrating,
changes in the way you sleep.

1994
01:49:04,571 --> 01:49:05,830
I sleep great.
That's it.

1995
01:49:06,370 --> 01:49:08,170
Everything else though,
changes in appetite.

1996
01:49:08,171 --> 01:49:10,360
I'm always hungry.
Aches and pains.

1997
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:12,880
Not really actually,
but everything else.

1998
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:17,050
Like I'm sad,
empty,

1999
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:19,240
anxious.
Always helpless,

2000
01:49:19,241 --> 01:49:20,260
worthless,
guilty.

2001
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,153
Always.
Like I got to the point now where I was 

2002
01:49:23,231 --> 01:49:24,064
like,
I'm really now decided to like actually 

2003
01:49:26,531 --> 01:49:27,364
treat this because it's become 
unbearable for me recently is that I 

2004
01:49:30,341 --> 01:49:31,174
was,
I'm like always at war with myself and 

2005
01:49:33,251 --> 01:49:37,300
my head,
like torturing myself.

2006
01:49:37,330 --> 01:49:40,420
Like every little thing,
like social things pass things,

2007
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:41,283
things that happen.
A long time ago things had happened now 

2008
01:49:42,731 --> 01:49:43,564
on day to day basis,
small things like you'll say something 

2009
01:49:45,461 --> 01:49:48,940
and then you're like torture or I'll do 
something.

2010
01:49:48,941 --> 01:49:49,774
Anything,
but it's like I'm always feeling guilty 

2011
01:49:52,691 --> 01:49:55,330
or is it just like the dumbest things 
like and you know,

2012
01:49:55,331 --> 01:49:57,070
that,
but just always at war with myself in my

2013
01:49:57,071 --> 01:49:58,750
head.
Hopeless,

2014
01:49:58,990 --> 01:50:00,460
pessimistic,
you know?

2015
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,073
Yeah.

2016
01:50:03,890 --> 01:50:05,090
Irritable,
big time.

2017
01:50:05,091 --> 01:50:09,260
Fucking so irritable and I hate being 
irritable because you know,

2018
01:50:09,261 --> 01:50:11,680
like,
you know that you have,

2019
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:15,260
you shouldn't be but you are as the 
worst and you just can't help it.

2020
01:50:15,261 --> 01:50:17,630
You just like fuck that.
Everything annoys me but.

2021
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:20,750
And I don't and I so don't want to be an
asshole.

2022
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:23,450
I so don't want to be an asshole right 
now,

2023
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:24,433
but I'm just so irritated.
I hate that and I would feel that all 

2024
01:50:28,851 --> 01:50:29,684
the time,

2025
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:31,823
like

2026
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:32,793
all the time everyday.
So in bowl and it's exhausting for you 

2027
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,700
because I'm fucking not that pleasant to
be around most of the time.

2028
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:50,050
Loss of interest in activities.
I don't have hobbies.

2029
01:50:50,051 --> 01:50:50,884
I don't enjoy doing anything.
I used to love playing video games and 

2030
01:50:52,661 --> 01:50:55,120
for the past years like I don't,
I didn't even listen to music.

2031
01:50:55,430 --> 01:50:59,350
I don't even enjoy listening to music.
Less energetic.

2032
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,940
Yeah.
Tired all the time.

2033
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:05,470
Trouble concentrating.
So hard for me to do shit.

2034
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:08,863
Trouble remembering details.
Isla to have trouble remembering 

2035
01:51:12,681 --> 01:51:14,950
details.
Zip Code.

2036
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:17,210
Oh yes.
Oh my God.

2037
01:51:18,650 --> 01:51:20,840
Oh,
that will drive me crazy.

2038
01:51:20,841 --> 01:51:23,180
Ethan doesn't know the address of his 
home.

2039
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:24,170
Well,
I do.

2040
01:51:24,171 --> 01:51:25,520
Just not.
There's no you don't.

2041
01:51:25,730 --> 01:51:26,810
I do.
Just not the zip.

2042
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:30,590
Well that's like half of the address.
What else do I need to know?

2043
01:51:30,591 --> 01:51:33,080
I don't understand why people ask for 
zip codes anymore.

2044
01:51:33,081 --> 01:51:35,300
Here's the fucking address.
Here's the city.

2045
01:51:35,301 --> 01:51:37,460
You don't need this navy.
I'm irritable too,

2046
01:51:37,461 --> 01:51:39,890
but oh my God.
Every time you think.

2047
01:51:39,891 --> 01:51:41,130
Well,
last zip code.

2048
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:45,080
It's like it's your home insurance.
I don't know.

2049
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:46,543
Remember zip codes.
I'm overwhelmed to make decisions 

2050
01:51:52,191 --> 01:51:54,080
whether big or small.
Unmanned man.

2051
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:58,580
It was like just.
I mean I was at the point recently where

2052
01:51:58,581 --> 01:51:59,414
it was like,
I cannot continue to live my life like 

2053
01:52:03,921 --> 01:52:06,230
this.
I will do anything.

2054
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:08,263
And you guys might recall me saying that
I had like this bottle of 

2055
01:52:11,691 --> 01:52:12,524
antidepressants by my bed for the 
longest time because I felt like I 

2056
01:52:14,241 --> 01:52:15,074
hadn't tried everything first and I feel
like I took three months and I actually 

2057
01:52:17,931 --> 01:52:20,030
did make a lot of positive changes in my
life,

2058
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:23,330
but I still felt awful,

2059
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:26,740
I guess not.
I,

2060
01:52:26,741 --> 01:52:29,320
I made a pretty good at.
For me the biggest,

2061
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:34,960
the biggest thing for me was like 
getting away from social media,

2062
01:52:37,690 --> 01:52:38,523
from Youtube and it.
But it's hard to know sometimes it's 

2063
01:52:41,171 --> 01:52:46,171
like leaving youtube sometimes makes you
more anxious

2064
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:50,120
and then everyone else gets upset and 
that makes you more anxious.

2065
01:52:50,121 --> 01:52:50,954
And so it's hard.
It's hard to know what is the right 

2066
01:52:53,271 --> 01:52:55,850
thing for you or whatever.
But anyway,

2067
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:58,580
I don't know,
I've never gone to therapy there.

2068
01:52:58,581 --> 01:53:00,650
I have my first therapy appointment on 
Monday.

2069
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:05,040
Pretty excited.
I'm going,

2070
01:53:05,041 --> 01:53:06,030
if he's going to fix me,
right?

2071
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:10,950
Uh,
I'll be like,

2072
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:12,010
alright,
you know,

2073
01:53:12,011 --> 01:53:12,844
I,
I went to a therapist once through a 

2074
01:53:15,450 --> 01:53:17,190
kaiser,
which is our healthcare.

2075
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:20,090
And it was such an awful experience.
I never wanted to go again.

2076
01:53:20,130 --> 01:53:20,963
I show up.
It's like Mcdonald's therapy I show up 

2077
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:26,460
and right out the bat,
you know,

2078
01:53:26,461 --> 01:53:27,720
you expect that.
It's always like,

2079
01:53:27,721 --> 01:53:29,490
tell me about your family.
Where did you grow up?

2080
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:30,540
Like,
get to know the guy,

2081
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:33,000
get comfortable.
So I sit down and I swear to God,

2082
01:53:33,001 --> 01:53:33,960
this is what he does.
He goes,

2083
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:36,150
all right,
so what's wrong?

2084
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:38,360
But what do you want to talk about?
Like,

2085
01:53:38,530 --> 01:53:39,900
what's bothering you?
What's wrong?

2086
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:41,213
I was like,
Whoa,

2087
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:46,320
like fucking go to treat a girl to 
dinner before you fucker.

2088
01:53:47,290 --> 01:53:51,450
You know,
I was just blown away by that.

2089
01:53:51,910 --> 01:53:52,920
He's like,
what's bothering you?

2090
01:53:53,070 --> 01:53:54,150
We have 30 minutes.
Come on.

2091
01:53:54,151 --> 01:53:55,980
We've got plenty of.
I got a lot of patients here.

2092
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:58,073
It was fucking crazy.
I felt so uncomfortable do the whole 

2093
01:54:00,151 --> 01:54:03,540
thing because I don't know this guy.
So I was like,

2094
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,433
oh well we've got a bunch of ads on my 
youtube channel that I don't want to do 

2095
01:54:10,590 --> 01:54:14,670
and I don't feel like making content,
but I have these obligations.

2096
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:17,700
Then he's like,
so tell me,

2097
01:54:17,701 --> 01:54:18,511
uh,
how did.

2098
01:54:18,511 --> 01:54:19,800
So how do you make money on youtube 
again?

2099
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:28,460
Was fucking awful.
I love that.

2100
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:32,500
That's like a great name.
So tell me what's bothering you,

2101
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:34,900
what's on your mind?
Well,

2102
01:54:34,901 --> 01:54:35,870
uh,
my father,

2103
01:54:35,871 --> 01:54:37,770
uh,
raped me when I was a kid and uh,

2104
01:54:38,010 --> 01:54:39,190
all right,
well here's what you do.

2105
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:40,833
Just forget all about that crazy.
So I'm going to a private therapists 

2106
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:48,760
that came highly recommended from a 
friend.

2107
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:53,200
I'm really excited to Beverly Hills,
but you know,

2108
01:54:53,201 --> 01:54:55,610
he's fucking legit.
Uh,

2109
01:54:55,930 --> 01:55:00,930
yeah.
Uh,

2110
01:55:01,570 --> 01:55:04,900
but to answer your original question,
took a bit of a tangent here.

2111
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:06,933
Your original question was,
how did you confirm and admit you were 

2112
01:55:10,181 --> 01:55:10,871
depressed?
Well,

2113
01:55:10,871 --> 01:55:15,871
for me it took me a long time,
um,

2114
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:17,493
because I was embarrassed and ashamed 
and I felt like people around it's kind 

2115
01:55:24,461 --> 01:55:28,340
of embarrassing thing to,
Oh,

2116
01:55:28,341 --> 01:55:31,070
I'm depressed.
Oh,

2117
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:33,110
oh,
get over it.

2118
01:55:34,670 --> 01:55:36,830
I got an email.
People just don't understand.

2119
01:55:36,831 --> 01:55:38,630
I got an email from someone that like A.

2120
01:55:44,330 --> 01:55:45,980
Anyway,
whatever people don't understand.

2121
01:55:47,060 --> 01:55:47,780
But,
uh,

2122
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:49,580
to you,
I would just ask yourself,

2123
01:55:49,581 --> 01:55:50,414
I mean,
you clearly are aware that something's 

2124
01:55:53,961 --> 01:55:54,794
off and you're not happy.
There's clearly some aspects of your 

2125
01:55:58,821 --> 01:55:59,654
life that are you're not happy with and 
you're not comfortable with that you 

2126
01:56:02,201 --> 01:56:03,034
would like to change.
They're causing you to feel possibly 

2127
01:56:05,841 --> 01:56:07,250
depressed.
I would,

2128
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:12,340
I would consider looking at these 
symptoms because for me it's really just

2129
01:56:14,331 --> 01:56:15,164
been crippling and a large part of the 
reason why we've just been gone for so 

2130
01:56:20,421 --> 01:56:25,421
long.
But also I'm not a professional.

2131
01:56:25,491 --> 01:56:26,840
I can't diagnose you,
so you should.

2132
01:56:26,870 --> 01:56:28,910
You should see a therapist.
I feel like everyone.

2133
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:30,373
I know it seems like a luxury,
but actually a friend of ours was 

2134
01:56:33,111 --> 01:56:34,260
telling us like,
there's,

2135
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:36,320
there's cheap.
What was the name of this place?

2136
01:56:36,321 --> 01:56:38,870
She said,
well,

2137
01:56:38,930 --> 01:56:39,763
they have therapy on a sliding scale,
so if you're broke you can go see a 

2138
01:56:43,161 --> 01:56:44,420
therapist for 20 bucks.

2139
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:45,703
[inaudible]

2140
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:47,190
and also there's,
there's,

2141
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:48,293
there's,
you know,

2142
01:56:48,330 --> 01:56:49,163
there's ways to figure it out.
But ultimately I think it's important 

2143
01:56:53,281 --> 01:56:56,010
for people to know that you just,
you don't have to suffer,

2144
01:56:56,040 --> 01:57:01,040
you don't have to carry it.
You got to make the decision that you're

2145
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,780
just going to fight it.
Right?

2146
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:09,950
You don't want to be a victim to sell.
Fuck you.

2147
01:57:09,951 --> 01:57:10,784
No,
fuck that.

2148
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:14,353
It's like you're just wasting your time 
on this earth to feeling miserable and 

2149
01:57:16,861 --> 01:57:19,380
what's the point of that?
So do what you can,

2150
01:57:20,030 --> 01:57:20,863
you know,
because there's a lot of people before 

2151
01:57:24,931 --> 01:57:25,764
you that have dealt with it and gotten 
out of the woods and they're really 

2152
01:57:30,661 --> 01:57:35,661
smart and they are there to help 
everybody else because it sucks there to

2153
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:39,780
help you with therapy because they're 
geniuses.

2154
01:57:39,781 --> 01:57:42,480
These therapists,
they have studied,

2155
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:46,200
they have phds.
They have studied this shit for decades.

2156
01:57:46,201 --> 01:57:48,450
They know how the brain works,
right?

2157
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:50,820
That's,
that's something.

2158
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:53,730
I'm just a guy.
I don't know how the brain works.

2159
01:57:53,731 --> 01:57:54,564
Right,
but they can get in your head and 

2160
01:57:55,921 --> 01:57:59,850
untangle shit and understand you and 
ways that you can't.

2161
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:06,620
They've got drugs that help ease the 
burden while you figure it out.

2162
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:10,763
Yeah.
No,

2163
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:15,230
you don't have to be miserable all.
Well,

2164
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:17,580
if you already are miserable,
what do you have to lose anyway?

2165
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:21,450
Because a fuck.
It's like at one at,

2166
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:25,650
at a certain point,
nothing else matters,

2167
01:58:25,651 --> 01:58:29,430
but getting better because what does it.
What does anything matter?

2168
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:33,420
If you're that miserable,
it's just like what else?

2169
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:34,493
At that point matters at all except 
prioritizing number one yourself and 

2170
01:58:39,721 --> 01:58:41,560
getting better.
You can't help anyone around.

2171
01:58:41,561 --> 01:58:42,130
You can't do

2172
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:44,980
anything for yourself or anyone else 
until you feel better.

2173
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:51,800
So that's my,
that's my opinion.

2174
01:58:53,130 --> 01:58:55,260
Yeah.
Um,

2175
01:58:58,970 --> 01:59:00,890
and depressions on the rise,
you know,

2176
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:01,993
more people are feeling it more than 
ever because my theory personally on 

2177
01:59:06,591 --> 01:59:11,030
that is that the world is increasingly 
complex,

2178
01:59:11,420 --> 01:59:12,253
complicated,
difficult to find your place in the 

2179
01:59:15,501 --> 01:59:19,580
world,
the find a spouse in the world to find a

2180
01:59:19,581 --> 01:59:21,140
career,
to find a purpose,

2181
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:22,243
to make money.
Everything is so hard to figure out 

2182
01:59:26,990 --> 01:59:27,823
that.
Um,

2183
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:31,040
and we carry a lot of stress and 
alongside a lot of bills,

2184
01:59:31,041 --> 01:59:32,540
a lot of responsibility

2185
01:59:32,610 --> 01:59:34,670
generation especially like who can 
afford it.

2186
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:36,660
No fucking body.

2187
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:39,753
Like I think about our situation.
We are fortunate enough to have been 

2188
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:43,360
able to buy a house.

2189
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:44,883
But,
but I know the feeling from you just a 

2190
01:59:46,690 --> 01:59:47,523
few years ago did we?
No,

2191
01:59:47,670 --> 01:59:47,980
no,
we,

2192
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:50,710
we've worked all our life and we weren't
even close.

2193
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:52,890
We have,
we were on.

2194
01:59:53,190 --> 01:59:54,023
We were statistically anomalous with our
success and the amount of money that we 

2195
02:00:01,061 --> 02:00:04,140
were able to make in the short time from
being successful.

2196
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:06,720
But we've been,
like you said,

2197
02:00:06,721 --> 02:00:10,020
just a couple short years earlier,
making like 30,

2198
02:00:10,021 --> 02:00:12,000
$40,000
with you and the two of us.

2199
02:00:12,810 --> 02:00:13,643
And um,

2200
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:17,230
that's important.
Yeah.

2201
02:00:17,290 --> 02:00:18,430
You're like,
buy a house.

2202
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:21,663
Never happened.
So I wonder when we're in this 

2203
02:00:25,061 --> 02:00:29,380
anomalous,
like an unbelievably lucky situation.

2204
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:31,690
How the fuck does anyone else have a 
chance?

2205
02:00:32,230 --> 02:00:33,290
But it doesn't.
But again,

2206
02:00:33,291 --> 02:00:34,124
that you can be at any station of life 
and still life is complicated in this 

2207
02:00:39,610 --> 02:00:41,590
day and age with the Internet,
with the cars,

2208
02:00:41,591 --> 02:00:42,424
with bill's responsibility and know I'm 
more depressed now because I feel more 

2209
02:00:47,801 --> 02:00:52,180
lost in my purpose.
And like,

2210
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:56,920
I actually heard a really good.
I don't remember who said it,

2211
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:57,910
but it's like,
um,

2212
02:00:58,270 --> 02:01:02,470
when you have money and like financial 
safety,

2213
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:05,050
all that's left is in your head.

2214
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:09,533
That was talking to about not when I.
Cause I was saying before that you're 

2215
02:01:14,921 --> 02:01:15,940
always like,
well,

2216
02:01:15,941 --> 02:01:19,990
if only I could afford that trip,
I wouldn't be happy.

2217
02:01:19,991 --> 02:01:22,250
But until then I can afford it,
or if I just or,

2218
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:25,060
or it's like if only I could afford this
house,

2219
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:26,390
that would be perfect.

2220
02:01:26,410 --> 02:01:27,670
My thing was like,
Oh,

2221
02:01:27,730 --> 02:01:29,530
if only I couldn't,
didn't pay rent,

2222
02:01:30,270 --> 02:01:31,870
rent.
I'd be set for life.

2223
02:01:32,010 --> 02:01:35,220
So you always have this like you're 
chasing a goal.

2224
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:36,113
If I then I'll be happy.
Right now I'm not happy because I can't 

2225
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:41,600
afford it.
But you work towards it and it gives you

2226
02:01:41,601 --> 02:01:43,710
a purpose.
Yeah.

2227
02:01:44,090 --> 02:01:47,390
But when you can afford it and you're 
still not happy,

2228
02:01:47,930 --> 02:01:48,763
then it's like,
what is that thing that will make me 

2229
02:01:50,091 --> 02:01:50,924
happy?
Yeah.

2230
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:52,910
But I.
But anyway,

2231
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:54,620
I'm in,
I'm in a rare situation.

2232
02:01:54,621 --> 02:01:56,450
It's hard to relate to what I'm going 
through there.

2233
02:01:56,810 --> 02:02:00,650
But just generally speaking,
life is so complicated.

2234
02:02:00,651 --> 02:02:01,484
Like think back 50 years,
people didn't have phones that have 

2235
02:02:03,111 --> 02:02:05,690
fucking Internet,
they just worked on farms.

2236
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:13,130
I genuinely think that like if you just 
woke up at 8:00

2237
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:13,963
AM and worked on the farm for eight 
hours and went home and ate dinner and 

2238
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:19,700
chill,
it's like that simple man.

2239
02:02:19,701 --> 02:02:22,850
There's nothing to crave.
Like that's,

2240
02:02:22,851 --> 02:02:23,684
you know,
that's.

2241
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:27,350
And I think that like modern day life 
really goes against our,

2242
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:33,460
are a fundamental instincts as animals,
like billions of years of,

2243
02:02:36,970 --> 02:02:37,770
of,
uh,

2244
02:02:37,770 --> 02:02:42,770
end stinks and expectation of what life 
is and how to survive.

2245
02:02:44,030 --> 02:02:44,960
That's what it is,
right?

2246
02:02:44,961 --> 02:02:45,794
Billions of years of survival instincts 
have all of the sudden in the past 100 

2247
02:02:49,521 --> 02:02:50,354
years completely betrayed us because all
of a sudden these survival instincts 

2248
02:02:54,531 --> 02:02:58,760
that we've inherited over evolution,
billions of years are no longer relevant

2249
02:02:58,790 --> 02:03:01,040
at all.
Right?

2250
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:06,250
And that's fucked up.
So I think a lot of people have,

2251
02:03:07,060 --> 02:03:08,360
have trouble adjusting.

2252
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:12,170
It's weird because also you all of a 
sudden,

2253
02:03:12,171 --> 02:03:15,740
I didn't have a lot of opportunities.
The demon before.

2254
02:03:16,090 --> 02:03:17,450
You have a lot of,
you know,

2255
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:19,340
there's a lot of good that came with it.
Sure.

2256
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:22,830
But it's also great playing.
Yeah.

2257
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:26,400
So,
you know,

2258
02:03:26,430 --> 02:03:28,880
I think,
I think that,

2259
02:03:28,910 --> 02:03:29,743
um,
I think it's important to bear that in 

2260
02:03:35,261 --> 02:03:36,094
mind that life is really fucking can be 
very challenging and confusing and 

2261
02:03:43,701 --> 02:03:44,534
overwhelming.
It's like my God who can balance all 

2262
02:03:45,801 --> 02:03:50,120
those things when instinctually I just 
want to go plant some carrots,

2263
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:52,693
right?
Or go gather some berries or some shit 

2264
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:56,590
or go kill a deer and then chill and the
TP,

2265
02:03:57,770 --> 02:04:02,770
you know.
So anyway,

2266
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:09,270
I'm looking forward to the essays of 
disproving my theory.

2267
02:04:13,150 --> 02:04:13,983
Well,
that's just my thoughts and if you 

2268
02:04:14,471 --> 02:04:15,670
disagree,
you're wrong.

2269
02:04:17,290 --> 02:04:18,970
Anyway.
I hope I wish you all the best.

2270
02:04:18,971 --> 02:04:23,971
And um,
and uh,

2271
02:04:24,201 --> 02:04:25,460
yeah,
you should dump.

2272
02:04:25,461 --> 02:04:29,390
Don't be afraid to seek help and don't 
feel weak because you are not alone.

2273
02:04:29,391 --> 02:04:34,391
And increasingly less alone.
You know,

2274
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:39,520
100 years ago was like,
or maybe 200,000

2275
02:04:42,461 --> 02:04:44,500
years ago,
you know,

2276
02:04:44,501 --> 02:04:46,510
if I've heard this and I don't know if 
it's true,

2277
02:04:46,930 --> 02:04:47,763
but I've heard this,
that like an amish communities that 

2278
02:04:50,501 --> 02:04:54,040
depression and anxiety is like 
completely nonexistent.

2279
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:56,383
Hmm.

2280
02:04:57,430 --> 02:04:58,630
No,
you know about the amish.

2281
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:00,150
The Amish.
Yeah.

2282
02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:02,150
Yeah.
And that,

2283
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:03,430
that makes sense to me,
right?

2284
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:08,460
Because they're fully fulfilled.
They have very basic,

2285
02:05:09,930 --> 02:05:11,530
uh,
or not basic,

2286
02:05:11,531 --> 02:05:12,364
but they have very,
they know what to expect every day and 

2287
02:05:15,491 --> 02:05:18,910
they're fulfilled every day and their 
life is,

2288
02:05:18,970 --> 02:05:19,803
they understand what it is day to day.
It's not like you went about how many 

2289
02:05:23,201 --> 02:05:25,420
days do you wake up and you're like,
like,

2290
02:05:25,421 --> 02:05:26,000
fuck,
what,

2291
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,360
what?
Like what am I going to do today?

2292
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:29,980
Like,
you know,

2293
02:05:31,150 --> 02:05:34,000
anyway,
that's it.

2294
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:41,540
Meanwhile,
Papa's in the backyard.

2295
02:05:42,970 --> 02:05:43,810
And uh,

2296
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:49,850
clothes on the hanging pent on the rack,
flapping in the wind.

2297
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:52,190
Papa clutches his heart play the music.

2298
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:55,530
Papa clutches his heart

2299
02:05:57,050 --> 02:05:59,960
is running around the backyard,
playing with a paper airplane.

2300
02:06:01,050 --> 02:06:02,630
And Papa clutches his heart.

2301
02:06:07,730 --> 02:06:12,730
I feel mad with no,
no pizza sauce.

2302
02:06:17,860 --> 02:06:22,360
Remember me bury me in my favorite 
mayor,

2303
02:06:22,370 --> 02:06:26,650
narrow,
very narrow,

2304
02:06:27,730 --> 02:06:29,980
and my favorite pizza,
the meat lovers,

2305
02:06:29,981 --> 02:06:34,981
pizza with sausage and Pepperoni.
And remember,

2306
02:06:36,940 --> 02:06:41,940
made fun and make my tombstone a giant 
box of Papa John's with my pitcher.

2307
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:50,230
Proudly the box before they removed it

2308
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:55,510
with an apostrophe.
John's my company and I bumped John.

2309
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:58,293
Shanda.
Thank you everyone for watching and

2311
02:07:13,430 --> 02:07:18,430
better butter sauce.
Never disrespect to Alfredo sauce and to

2312
02:07:23,391 --> 02:07:24,800
you,
I see this.

2313
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:36,800
Oh No,

2314
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:38,560
Falls over and has a heart attack and 
dies.

2318
