00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,610
We are truly blessed to be enjoying a 
Friday together.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,330
God,
you know,

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,173
I saw one time I was at a store and 
someone in the checkout lady and she 

13
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:44,940
says to me,
have a blessed day and I was like,

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,913
I don't believe in God,
but I just love that I have a blessed 

15
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:49,254
day.
Like damn,

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,050
like good day.
No bless it.

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,123
That's pretty nice.
I was taught like the idea that God and 

18
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:03,021
all of his infinite power and wisdom was
like this day is a blessed for you,

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,530
for you and only you.

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,150
I love that.
Not only you,

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,160
we're all blessed to have a blessed day.
I just love it.

22
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,810
So I have a bloodstained Friday.
Everyone.

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,020
We've got a lot to talk about.
We're talking about better help.

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,543
A lot of controversy there.
We are talking about there's been a 

25
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:21,510
story that Lacroix Popular Sodie pop 
drink,

26
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,403
which of which I'm a big fan,
is being sued for putting cockroach 

27
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:31,790
poison in their drinks.
Sounds a little far fetched.

28
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,120
Horrible,
but is it.

29
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,220
Let's find out.
We're going to take a deep dive.

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,113
We've also got up a Kanye West,
the great Kanye West a had a meeting 

31
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:46,641
with Donald Trump that has got a lot of 
people talking and so much more today on

32
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:49,200
the.
Join me under the Gazebo.

33
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,034
Would you please experience.
So let's start from the over in the 

34
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,310
Gazebo.
Let's start from the top.

35
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:56,170
You're better help.
Okay.

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,950
Now better help.

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,050
I think that there's a lot of 
misconceptions going around.

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,990
I'm not,
we're going to take a deep dive.

39
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,430
We've also.
Oh no,

40
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,690
that wasn't going the whole time.
Was it?

41
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,040
Okay,
good.

42
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm not using my laptop is also right.
Right.

43
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,430
Okay.
Alright.

44
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,813
Where was that a Eli?
Can you throw me under the customer 

45
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,770
better help?
Um,

46
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,570
there's been a lot of misconception 
about I'm,

47
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:29,404
I'm,
I'm talking about my involvement with 

48
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:31,674
better help.
Okay.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,200
Um,
let,

50
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,690
let me start from the top.
Better help is a,

51
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:40,560
an online therapy service.
Okay.

52
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,990
Um,
um,

53
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:48,030
which they've sponsored one of our 
podcast episodes a couple of months ago.

54
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,180
Okay.
Now a lot of youtubers have been getting

55
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,014
criticized lately for having put better 
help reads on their videos about mental 

56
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:05,080
health,
about them being depressed and such.

57
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,973
And a lot of people have been accusing 
them of being predatory because they're 

58
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:10,991
like,
oh,

59
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,430
I'm so depressed and here's better help.

60
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,263
They're accusing them of a exaggerating 
their depression to sell better help or 

61
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,740
to go to better help sponsor,
I don't know.

62
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,383
And then people started going through 
their terms of service and found some 

63
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,430
concerning things there as well of the 
service itself.

64
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,280
In the terms of service.
There was something I,

65
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,040
I,
I don't remember exactly.

66
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:33,874
There was something like a,
they can't guarantee that your 

67
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,360
conversations,
private stuff like that.

68
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:40,880
Like,
like,

69
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,220
you know,
weird stuff.

70
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,830
And so first of all,
I want to make clear,

71
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,730
okay.
First of all,

72
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,613
we had one sponsor with better help that
was two months ago and the topic of 

73
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:53,554
mental health was not brought up in 
association with our read at all and to 

74
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:58,684
the best of my recollection,
I don't think that we even talked about 

75
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:01,024
it in that episode and it predated our 
update video when I talked about being 

76
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:07,420
depressed by month a month at least.

77
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,283
Okay.
But here's where I think people got 

78
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:10,984
thrown off because Pewdie pie made a new
video about it and he goes through the 

79
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:17,380
terms of service and he points out a lot
of questionable things,

80
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:18,214
which is fine and he doesn't like the 
service and he raises good points about 

81
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:22,774
it,
but the way that he presented my 

82
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:25,954
involvement in it I thought was a little
misleading and a little out of context 

83
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,360
and it made it look like I was way more 
involved with this company that I was.

84
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,743
Or even that it made it look like I used
my being depressed to somehow sell 

85
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,243
better help.
So I want to show you guys if I could 

86
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,440
please exhibit a.
It was.

87
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,260
This is beauty pies video.
Let me go back a little bit.

88
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,060
So here,
let's watch this.

89
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,860
So he goes on here and he's talking 
about here.

90
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,550
I was just joking.
By the way guys,

91
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,800
everyone needs to sociopath enter the 
code.

92
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,160
Shane,
for your cheaper online therapy to date,

93
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,100
I would never have guessed it was 
actually this was the case.

94
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,050
So this leads to a lot of the sponsored 
videos of these 100,

95
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,950
100 of Youtube ers being about mental 
health,

96
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,000
which could actually be a good thing,
but they are made so that people sign up

97
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,770
for the website.
I'm Scott.

98
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,460
It's Scott from depression to 
expression.

99
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,333
So he's saying there's all these you 
tubers that are promoting better health 

100
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,080
on videos about depression.
He has a problem with that.

101
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,960
He doesn't think that that's ethical.
So here's,

102
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,980
here's what he shows here.

103
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,220
If you're looking for anything to miss 
out on,

104
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,180
don't miss out on this.
Welcome to expression.

105
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,053
Whoa.
I actually messed up there and 

106
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:45,674
completely serious before we start.
I have so much respect for each and 

107
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:50,804
every one of you for watching and being.
Why do you ask for my payment 

108
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:54,350
information now?
Okay.

109
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,040
As we know have been in therapy,
I've been

110
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
just dealing with a lot of stuff that I 
needed to deal with and I feel good 

111
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,660
anyways.
I feel good.

112
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,310
That's what is that probably about so 
you can access professional,

113
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:11,510
affordable and convenient counseling.
I just hit a wall where it was.

114
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,383
It has gotten so bad that it was 
basically either stop making videos or 

115
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,170
disappear.
Also,

116
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,760
this video is sponsored by better 
health,

117
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,623
more information about that,
so the way it's cut makes it look like 

118
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,693
my video.
My update video was sponsored by better 

119
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,340
health and that's what I felt when I saw
it too.

120
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,080
Yeah,
and I thought it was.

121
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,861
I was like,
Whoa,

122
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:34,694
like why would that be there?
That gives totally the wrong impression 

123
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,640
because I've never talked about better 
health and depression.

124
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,880
Ever fact,
when I did the sponsoree two months ago,

125
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,900
I didn't even endorse the product 
because I have never used the service.

126
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:49,963
We checked it to make sure we checked it
to make sure that within 24 hours a 

127
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:56,204
therapist contacted us and they did.
So we did some due diligence in that 

128
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:01,820
regard to test out the service,
but I never endorsed it.

129
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,520
I never said that I used it to treat my 
depression either,

130
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,410
but it seemed.
But at any rate,

131
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:06,981
let me,
let me say,

132
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:08,690
focus on this.
Um,

133
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,393
that seems like the only reasonable 
conclusion to make is that he's calling 

134
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,610
me out,
which is,

135
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,540
I thought I was like,
Dude,

136
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,750
what the hell?
And I was,

137
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,790
I was pretty upset with him and I 
contacted him directly and I was like,

138
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,860
hey man,
what,

139
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,060
why,
what's the deal?

140
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,923
And he says he didn't,
he didn't mean to make it look that way 

141
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,063
and he made a comment trying to clarify.
But the people that read the comments 

142
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,830
compared to the people that watched the 
video is very small.

143
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,770
Okay.
So what happened here is that,

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,300
um,
Bobby Burns,

145
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,433
this youtuber here made a video about 
depression that's sponsored by better 

146
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:55,721
help and he uses my clip in it talking 
about depression.

147
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,990
So here,
let me show you this anymore videos.

148
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,123
I just hit a wall where it was gotten so
bad that it was basically either stop 

149
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:09,590
making videos or disappear forever.

150
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,170
So today's video is going to be about 
youtube happiness.

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,840
We're get started.
Make sure you hit that notification.

152
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:19,970
Bell lets you know whenever I upload new
videos also,

153
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:20,804
this video is sponsored by Dell.
You'll notice that it's from bobby's 

154
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:24,884
video,
but he cut out the context so to 

155
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,490
understand either way because the part 
in pdfs video,

156
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,353
it's just kinda like a super cut of 
examples of like it doesn't really 

157
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:41,000
inform the Butler affordable and 
convenient counseling.

158
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,013
I just hit a wall but I think he did it.
He didn't do it on purpose but I just 

159
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:47,880
want to clarify,
you know,

160
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,763
because it makes sense to us.
It didn't make a difference to make a 

161
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:57,060
connection between being depressed and 
then from a company we didn't want to do

162
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:57,894
that.
That's my personal choice that we made 

163
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,893
so that it was kind of so.
And I think that [inaudible] who's the 

164
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:05,940
biggest youtuber in the world talking 
about this,

165
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:10,690
people take it seriously and it looks 
like it.

166
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,650
I mean,
that's how I interpret it.

167
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:13,484
I could be wrong.
I talked to a lot of other people that 

168
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:17,570
saw it that way too and it just seems 
like.

169
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,180
But you can see that basically either so
they don't seem to know more information

170
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:31,260
about that at the end of this video.
So again,

171
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:36,010
then he goes on to to criticize,
criticize a lot of youtubers.

172
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,990
He also doesn't really criticize them 
harshly,

173
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:45,991
is more criticizing this service of 
better help names.

174
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,890
He names a lot of people and he shows a 
lot of faces of people and you know,

175
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,050
when you're Pewdie Pie,
the effect of that is that.

176
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,130
Yeah,
he was,

177
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,450
he was very,
he was very tempered in his criticism.

178
00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:01,150
He wasn't like coming out.
He was being very.

179
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,340
He was being very rational and fair 
about it.

180
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:04,230
I mean,
I'm not saying,

181
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,283
but again,
I just want to clear that up that that 

182
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:08,830
video was not in any way sponsored by 
better.

183
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:11,080
Hell yeah.
We've only worked with them once so.

184
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:13,150
Okay.
But regardless of that,

185
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,673
I think it's pretty weird that bobby 
used that clip anyway because I keep 

186
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:22,261
seeing that clip going around of bobby 
using my clip talking about depression,

187
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,930
but there's not a clear separation.
So people think that.

188
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:31,650
But that's not the case.
So let me just see here.

189
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:34,404
I've got so

190
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,880
in response to the criticism.
So first of all,

191
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:40,050
I just want to make that clear.
Okay.

192
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,303
Now in response to their,
I think that there was some implication 

193
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:49,200
that anyone that works with better help 
is negligent,

194
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,490
a shill or irresponsible or somehow 
selling out their fans.

195
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,920
And even though I never mentioned 
depression,

196
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,130
am I read,
I do disagree with that assertion.

197
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,960
I do personally disagree with that 
assertion.

198
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,020
Now let me talk about this.
I'm not sure what.

199
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,900
First of all,
I'm not sure what I could do to vet them

200
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,530
more than I did.
I mean in a perfect world,

201
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:14,364
I liked the service.
It seems interesting and it seems like 

202
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:19,050
it would be useful for a lot of people.
Like on face value.

203
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,003
It seems like a cool service.
They're owned by a publicly traded 

204
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:23,664
company and they're one of the most 
widely advertised services on the 

205
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:27,660
internet across television,
radio,

206
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:28,830
podcasting,
and Youtube,

207
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,923
so with all the information available,
it's a perfectly rational decision to 

208
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:38,400
think that it's a good useful service 
and something that's good,

209
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,860
good to promote and I mean,
again,

210
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:41,694
these guys are going through the terms 
of service and picking it apart and 

211
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,800
there's weird questionable stuff in 
there,

212
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,640
but I don't think like this.

213
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,653
It's a.
it's a weird standard to make that you 

214
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:53,694
want the slit,
the expectation that anyone you ever 

215
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:57,004
work with your reading,
the entire 20 page legal document of a 

216
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:01,870
terms of service like I don't think 
anyone.

217
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,913
Very few people in the history of 
youtube have ever read the terms of 

218
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:08,950
service and I'm willing to bet that if 
they did read the terms of service,

219
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:09,784
they wouldn't want to work with them 
because terms of service is written to 

220
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,880
remove liability.
So it always sounds bad.

221
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:18,460
Terminal Service is meant to sound bad 
and scary.

222
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,160
They're literally.
The purpose is to remove liability,

223
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,290
so to expect youtube.
I don't think that's a slippery slope.

224
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,100
If you are expecting everyone to read 
the terms of service,

225
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,910
every partner that I've ever worked 
with,

226
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:32,620
I mean on,
on,

227
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,990
on face value,
it's as reputable as a,

228
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,130
as a partner as you can.

229
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,700
Yeah.
We've had some offers for responses that

230
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:43,350
we declined that happens.
But someone like better help,

231
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,910
like past all the questions that you 
would normally ask,

232
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:50,880
you know,
is they do have good reviews online when

233
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:51,714
we looked up.

234
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,201
Yeah,
of course.

235
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:56,440
No.
And people can promote people decide how

236
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:57,274
they want to promote different products.
I personally wasn't comfortable 

237
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:00,394
promoting it in terms of me being 
depressed and I wasn't personally 

238
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:06,130
comfortable saying I've used the service
when I haven't,

239
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,370
but it seemed good and it seems like 
it'd be useful and helpful.

240
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,220
So I promoted it as such.
Now,

241
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,143
um,
I think people are just a little too 

242
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:22,531
quick to throw others under the bus and 
be way overly cynical about this.

243
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,770
Okay.
Um,

244
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,253
I understand that it can seem in poor 
taste to promote better help in a video 

245
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:31,954
about being depressed,
which I didn't do for the record and I 

246
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:37,930
have never done.
But from the flip side,

247
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,950
think about it from their perspective.
Someone like,

248
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,350
like buggy felt the Franco,
Bobby Burns,

249
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:45,184
I don't know,
Shane,

250
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,910
everyone think of it from their side 
instead of being so cynical and thinking

251
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,100
that there is this elaborate scam to 
them,

252
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,180
it's a win win.

253
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,500
It's like,
oh,

254
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:57,100
this app is going to help people.
It seems like a good service.

255
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,560
And my videos promoted.
It's like,

256
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,210
you know,
be optimistic about it and it feels like

257
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:03,851
a one one.
I mean,

258
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:07,930
that's how sponsors as young Youtube 
I've always worked like content,

259
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,420
like sponsors.
If you have video game content,

260
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,960
you have a video game sponsorship on it.
If you make car content,

261
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,280
our tech content,
you have technology or car,

262
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,680
like,
like content,

263
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:19,540
like sponsors.
That's how it works.

264
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,970
So it's easy to see where people have 
come from,

265
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:27,610
thinking that it's okay to pair those 
up.

266
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,540
It seems like a win win.
Um,

267
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,280
and so I completely understand where 
they're coming from.

268
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,330
Um,
and I think once again,

269
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,853
people are thinking about it backwards.
I think what has been happening is that 

270
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:45,304
better help because there's been this 
implication that people have 

271
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:48,364
exaggerated,
being depressed to sell better help as 

272
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,280
that is a very powerful.

273
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,223
It really shitty that would be very 
shitty and the people that I've seen 

274
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,733
being called out are people that I know 
have had a history with mental health 

275
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,853
issues and so I think it's kind of 
ironic to like real and dog pile on 

276
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,960
these people who already kind of fucked 
up.

277
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,823
You know,
I think what I think you guys have it 

278
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:16,460
backwards.
The people who are being overly cynical,

279
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,923
people who have spoken about mental 
health issues are the people that are 

280
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:24,250
being approached by better health.
Right?

281
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,573
So it's not,
doesn't start from wanting to sell 

282
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:30,224
better help.
It starts from having these issues and 

283
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:35,480
then better help comes in because they 
see an opportunity.

284
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,940
I think that's how these partnerships 
have a happened.

285
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,043
And then finally I've heard this 
argument that it's unethical for you 

286
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:50,681
tubers to even make money from promoting
a service about mental health.

287
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,880
That I heard that it's unethical to take
money for it,

288
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,490
that it should be done for free even.
And I.

289
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,730
Well,
who benefits from doing it for free?

290
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,623
Better help,
what you're going to do free copyrights 

291
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:09,590
for better help their business.
You know,

292
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,570
as a capitalist society,
that's the way the world turns.

293
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,873
I mean saying it's illogical for a 
utuber are immoral for youtube or to 

294
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:23,110
collect money to promote better health.
Is,

295
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,210
is,
is similar to saying it,

296
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,403
is it a moral for a doctor or therapist 
or nurse to get paid for their work 

297
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,650
because it benefits people.
I mean this is a capitalist society.

298
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:37,610
We,
we.

299
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,830
This is how,
at what point,

300
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,773
where does the red line,
at what point does it become a moral 

301
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,783
right?
There's therapists the charge $50 an 

302
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:47,570
hour,
$200 an hour,

303
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:52,160
$500 an hour.
At what point does it become immoral for

304
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:54,170
therapists to charge $50 an hour?

305
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,110
$500 an hour.
So there's service not valuable.

306
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:59,750
Is that not a capital is not a 
commodity.

307
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:01,370
I mean,
you know what I'm saying?

308
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:04,010
If they're better at it too,
they not deserve to get paid more.

309
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,013
So this blanket statement that it's 
somehow immoral to sponsor online 

310
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:14,480
therapy strikes me as an odd one and not
one that makes much sense.

311
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,140
Especially considering,
uh,

312
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,820
here in the United States,
our costs spittles are doctors.

313
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,780
Everything Cancer Treatment for Christ 
sake is heavily monetized.

314
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,320
And I personally find that to be 
disgraceful.

315
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,810
But are we saying that they shouldn't 
get paid at all?

316
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,090
They should.
They volunteer.

317
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:33,440
I mean,
I,

318
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,303
it's a,
it's an argument that doesn't make much 

319
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:41,780
sense to you and it falls apart in my 
mind when you try to break it down.

320
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,280
I mean,
it's a nice,

321
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,293
it's a nice thought,
but it doesn't really make that much 

322
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:46,850
sense.
Now,

323
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:49,500
once again,
I want to acknowledge this is somebody I

324
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:53,400
worked with one time months ago and I 
never promoted them and context of being

325
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:57,810
depressed and I never said that I used 
their service to treat my depression.

326
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,370
I'm not a doctor.
I'm not journalist.

327
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,810
I'm not a lawyer.
This is my opinion.

328
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,003
Feel free to disagree,
but I've been watching this kind of 

329
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,084
devolve and I think that people are 
being way overly cynical about this and 

330
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,830
it's just another example of like,
I don't know,

331
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,863
it just feels like one of these things 
that just making youtube even more 

332
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,620
toxic,
like even more distrustful of people and

333
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:30,621
even more cynical of each other and to 
people and I just don't know why and and

334
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:32,130
I,
I dunno,

335
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,350
it just didn't feel.
It just doesn't feel right.

336
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,370
This whole thing and sure some people 
are being opportunistic.

337
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,233
Probably some,
but not always going to happen to 

338
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,900
someone.
Now there's,

339
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,753
there's been a lot of controversy about 
filter Franco because he was apparently 

340
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,243
sponsor with them and do it.
I don't know anything about what filter 

341
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,800
Franco's up to not commenting at all 
about that.

342
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,350
And I know like he had a bank connected 
somehow with Shane's better help.

343
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,390
Sponsorship.
He's not connected to us at all.

344
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,290
Ours came through an agency,
and let me say this,

345
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,570
by the way,
when you work with sponsors,

346
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,820
we work with a lot of sponsors here on 
the podcast.

347
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,730
They come through agencies that vet 
them,

348
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,763
the check for their credibility,
the collect payments and make sure 

349
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:15,780
they're legit.
Okay.

350
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,740
Because obviously,
yeah,

351
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,343
so obviously we as business owners and 
as entertainers are not going to read 

352
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:24,330
the terms of service.
All of our partners.

353
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,740
That's insane.
Nobody has time for that.

354
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,813
So we trust our agency to,
to verify the legitimacy of these 

355
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,710
companies and I don't think they failed 
in this case.

356
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,390
I mean we think about it too.
I don't just pass the buck completely to

357
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:39,960
them.
I make a conscious decision to work with

358
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,360
someone or not,
but in this case I don't regret it.

359
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,300
I mean like,
yeah,

360
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:47,040
there's some questionable things in 
terms of service,

361
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:47,874
but let me say this with the information
I had at the time I made the right 

362
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:51,774
decision.

363
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,953
[inaudible]

364
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,340
and,
and,

365
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,480
and that's it.
You know,

366
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,120
I think if you want to criticize the 
company,

367
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,920
that's one thing and that's totally 
fine,

368
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:03,520
but to come at Youtube,
Er's who have worked with them

369
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,920
seems overly cynical and toxic and it's 
just not.

370
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,360
I don't know.
It's just not necessary.

371
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:12,830
I don't know.
And you guys,

372
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,440
another crutch of this argument is the 
implication that people don't.

373
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,130
There's so many sponsors available on 
youtube now.

374
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,860
You don't have to act depressed to get a
sponsor on youtube.

375
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,490
You really don't.
I mean,

376
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,300
I don't know.
It just makes it.

377
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,143
I don't know.
That whole thing just made me feel 

378
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:35,300
really sad.
I felt really bad.

379
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,134
Honestly,
when I saw Felix is video and kind of 

380
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:39,740
the way it was portrayed.
I'm not gonna lie,

381
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:43,340
I felt it felt really awful and I didn't
mean to do it,

382
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,203
but like I didn't want people to think.
I know a lot of people were getting the 

383
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:47,594
wrong.
A lot of people went in and I felt bad 

384
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:51,454
for all the other people he named two 
because it's like these are people that 

385
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:58,140
are already sensitive and dealing with 
stuff and it's like.

386
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,560
It's like,
man,

387
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,420
I dunno.
Just overly cynical.

388
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,500
And again,
I chose not to talk about my depression.

389
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,330
People make decisions.
I didn't want to do that,

390
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:12,164
but that's just my opinion.
You can feel free to disagree with me 

391
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,560
and that's fine.
Okay.

392
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,040
We can have dissenting opinions.
You don't have to come fucking murder my

393
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:19,874
family and shit down my throat because I
happen to have my own opinion about 

394
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:23,174
this.
I think youtube has gotten way too 

395
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:29,510
fucking toxic way to overly cynical and 
when you start throwing good,

396
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,430
honest youtubers under the bus

397
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,440
that I think there,
I think we need to reel it back a little

398
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:38,640
bit.
You know,

399
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:39,474
there's some that's like,
I'm not saying that people shouldn't be 

400
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:44,070
criticized,
but it's like,

401
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,160
I dunno,
just whatever just felt bad.

402
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:53,250
The whole thing felt bad.
So that's,

403
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,960
that's,
that's my take.

404
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,450
And I hope that you won't come to my 
house at 3:00

405
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,450
AM and attempt to murder me over on his 
dissenting opinion because it's not that

406
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:10,250
serious after all.
And if you.

407
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:14,000
And if you are thinking that you may 
consider hopping over to [inaudible] dot

408
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,730
com slash eight,
three talking to the therapist.

409
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,303
Um,

410
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,973
God.

411
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,900
Okay.
I think I handled that.

412
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:27,790
Okay.
I didn't get too upset,

413
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:28,670
right?
No,

414
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,180
I don't.
I'm not trying to throw shade at anyone.

415
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:35,050
I'm not trying to be controversial.
I'm not trying to stir the pot.

416
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,140
I'm tired of feeling like everyone is 
out to get.

417
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,770
Everyone's looking at might feel ironic 
coming from now.

418
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,783
Okay.
Let me acknowledge that somebody who 

419
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:49,370
said who's notorious for,
you know,

420
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,570
making fun of people online.
Yeah.

421
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,200
But Hey,
that's just my opinion.

422
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,133
Okay.

423
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,010
On this topic specifically,

424
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,870
all right

425
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,290
also,
well,

426
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:10,150
whatever.
I think I put that to rest.

427
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,020
We've got lacroix.
You guys have all heard.

428
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,120
We're almost to a break,
but let me set this up and then we'll go

429
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:16,890
to a break.
Lacroix,

430
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,160
the Saudi pop of choice.
Crack open a fresh one.

431
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,650
Cheers.
Now,

432
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,613
a lot of you probably heard this 
headline that Lacroix is being sued for 

433
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,130
putting unnatural chemicals and it's 
drink.

434
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,210
Yes.
Sip it appealing.

435
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:39,270
I'm a limonene.
How do you say that?

436
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:41,850
Lemo nine Lemo Nini.
Lemoni.

437
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,870
It's a chemical that is also inside 
cockroach insecticide.

438
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,170
Now this is a heavily that has been 
widely seen around social media crash.

439
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,930
People have been texting me.
Chris delea texted me.

440
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:57,381
He's like,
dude,

441
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:59,390
what the fuck?
Because we're both a little croix.

442
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,650
I didn't even drink water anymore.
I'm a lacroix.

443
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,740
Seriously?
Not a joke.

444
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,750
Don't drink water dude.
Fuck that peasant juice waters called as

445
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:12,550
inches.
Now this is cochrane is well,

446
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,513
is it?
You know when the Lacroix came out it 

447
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:16,970
was a high.
It was a top shelf beverage.

448
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,140
I remember it was really expensive,
but now they saw what happened.

449
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,003
It's all on sale all the time.
It's like three bucks for 12 pack or 

450
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:25,870
something.
Yeah,

451
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,620
Dude.
Fucking brutal man.

452
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,390
They're competing with water and you 
believe that.

453
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,780
So anyway,
listen to me.

454
00:24:35,781 --> 00:24:40,781
It sounded far fetched.
So I wanted to take a deep dive.

455
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,343
What's at stake?
Who are the players who benefits the 

456
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:49,901
most from this?
And is it true that the Lich the Lacroix

457
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,520
controversy or Lacroix Gate?
Stay tuned after this break.

458
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,740
We will dive right into that here on the
podcast.

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,210

What's makes it Robin Hood.

464
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,980

That's right.

465
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,873
Zero.
Many of these trading after going to 

466
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:22,901
charge you dollars portrayed Robin Hood.
Coby is robbin the hood for the hood.

467
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,823
You feel me?
They strive to make financial services 

468
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:29,120
work for everyone and not just the 
wealthy.

00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,220
Dan uses this APP.
He loves it.

470
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:32,800
He swears by it.
I don't trade,

471
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,360
I don't know anything about trading,
but from what he says,

472
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,560
it's simple to use.

473
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,150
It has built in explanations and it's a 
great place to learn how to trade.

474
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,510
That stuff's complicated.
I'm intimidated,

475
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,480
but Robin Hood seems to make it easy,
intuitive,

476
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:49,580

501
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:07,944
news about online security breaches,
it's hard not to worry about where my 

502
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:12,870
data goes.
Everybody's leaking my data,

503
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,340
my passwords,
my credit card,

504
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,650

It's everywhere,

505
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,290
and guess what?
I don't need it leaking anymore.

private information at risk.
Try accessing a non secured network.

508
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:28,590
Maybe you're at the airport.

509
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,423
Boom.
Guess who's got your credit card 

510
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:32,640

You want that guy having it?
No.

512
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,990
Okay,

533
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,680
I imagined this where they are.
My opinions are not endorsed by Vpn.

534
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,390
Imagine your old coupon clipping,
grandpa.

computer and use as a plugin on your

Here's what hunting does.
You install it.

540
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,320
It's a plugin.
When you shop online,

541
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,210
pretty much everywhere.
I'm talking Amazon,

542
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:13,860
I'm talking Ebay.
I'm talking Walmart,

543
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:14,890
macy's,
dominoes,

544
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,090
dominoes.
You can get pizza coupons.

545
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,900
They are scanning the web for the most 
active uptodate,

546
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,530
best coupons available so that when 
you're at checkout honeys like,

548
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,460
your grandpa wouldn't say that.
What would your grandpa say?

549
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,640
Like a few study.
I got a coupon for that study.

550
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,140
That's what Hud.
He says,

551
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,100
I got a coupon for that sunny.
That's what honey says,

552
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,963

555
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,150
Look at this.
We once bought Jackson blankets.

556
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:52,660
I saved literally $360 from macy's.
Oh,

557
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,490
what?
That's what honey does.

558
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,160
Boom.
I got your sunny.

559
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,530
That's where your grandpa says as these 
coupon clipping coupons all night by the

560
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,360

It's free.
It's risk free.

563
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,380
It's just a chrome extension.
It takes just two clicks to install.

564
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,660
Give it a shot for a week and see if you
don't love it.

565
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,703
Apparently.

My little gazebos.

573
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,740
Um,

574
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,760

I want to say new age three video out,

575
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,130
which was a lot of fun.
Honestly.

576
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,710
I got to say I really want this one.
I took my time,

577
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,440
I enjoyed the process.
I took all the time I needed on.

578
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,323
We worked on it for like two weeks and I
would just sit down and edit and enjoy 

579
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:11,590
the experience and the sketch and 
everything.

580
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:15,580
So I think that I really enjoyed and the
reception was amazing.

581
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,770
I mean everyone was really happy about 
it.

582
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,813
I got to say I didn't think.
I don't think I saw one complaints 

583
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,820
actually have a collection of them for 
you.

584
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:26,230
If you want me to read those off real 
quick,

585
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,080
you know,
I'm just going to do it.

586
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,943
There's no complaints guys.
Why don't we sit over in the Gazebo and 

587
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:40,440
it felt good.
I think me and Isla realized,

588
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,450
I think recently we felt Ngozi boys 
because the boys.

589
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,360
I like that.
That feels special.

590
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,110
Are you a busy boy?
Z Boys?

591
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,740
Maybe we should name our child 
[inaudible],

592
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,593
but that's a good like gender neutral 
name because just given birth under a 

593
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:03,010
gazebo.
You know,

594
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:07,810
how people have all these weird like 
given water waterpool a gazebo.

595
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:12,811
Birth a blessing because it's a 
beautiful thing.

596
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,540
I feel like,
um,

597
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,710
I've seen some people echoing the 
sentiment that I,

598
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,713
I have spoken a lot of times that I 
don't want to be making videos like 

599
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:22,804
that,
but I feel like recently I have always 

600
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:26,044
wanted to go back to making videos like 
that and just until recently we weren't 

601
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,770
meant.
Yeah,

602
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,140
yeah,
that's what I mean,

603
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:37,300
that's what it was really.
It was just that I,

604
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:38,620
I,
I literally couldn't.

605
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,003
I don't know what it was,
but recently we really felt like we 

606
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:46,670
wanted to try and go back to making like
high quality.

607
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,440
I feel like they can embrace for like we
didn't make a video.

608
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,283
It's like three months and kind of 
started to crave the feeling of like 

609
00:32:53,141 --> 00:32:54,820
being creative and doing something.

610
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,803
Yeah,
that's what it was born from that we 

611
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,510
really wanted to say,
okay,

612
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,010
let's make the best video.
We can not cut any corners.

613
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,570
There's no deadline.
And so that's what we did.

614
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,310
And it was fun.
It was great.

615
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,300
I loved everything.
So hopefully more to come.

616
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,000
Um,
so anyway,

617
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:16,834
I'm glad you guys enjoyed and thanks for
all the wonderful comments and support 

618
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:24,030
tomorrow and Los Angeles for all of our 
La based [inaudible] boys.

619
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,750
Um,
where,

620
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,660
what,
what time is it at now?

621
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:33,310
You're surprising me with you can just 
google rip into right store.

622
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,590
But what time is it at?
11.

623
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,480
Hold on.
All right,

624
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,220
well either.
Does that check out?

625
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:42,010
This new teddy fresh?
What do you call this track suit?

626
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,320
Warmer.
It's a tracksuit tracksuit that's coming

627
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:47,440
out this winter.
They get this fresh shit.

628
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,780
The fit is insane.
The comfort level.

629
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,730
This shit is spicy hot.
It's breathe,

630
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,140
dude.
This thing is insane.

631
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,180
This is so comfortable.
I mean it was my goal for a long time to

632
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,520
Mecca tracks.
Ketty fresh watch out.

633
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:06,970
Watch out haters.
Because Teddy fresh is calming hard.

634
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,090
So it's at 11:00
AM tomorrow,

635
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,170
Tomorrow at 11:00
AM at [inaudible] store.

636
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:16,004
It's next to the supreme store.
And is it Hollywood and La Fairfax 

637
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,223
Avenue effect.
So we'll be there for about an hour or 

638
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:26,710
two and got the new rip indep 
collection.

639
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:28,970
Co Lab coming out.
Very excited about.

640
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,510
So.
So he goes there and um,

641
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,360
let's do it.
Is Lacroix poison?

642
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,080
That is the question we are looking to 
resolve today.

643
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,230
Who are the players at work?
Who benefits from this?

644
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,330
Before we get into this lacroix boy,
uh,

645
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,173
under the Gazebo.
A story I'd like to say cheers to 

646
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:50,960
everybody in the boys and back to enjoy 
everyone.

647
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:51,794
Crack Open Your Lacroix and have a nice 
refreshing sip of all natural essence 

648
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:56,024
sodie pop.

649
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,203
That's good.
So a new lawsuit alleges that a lacroix 

650
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,940
is not all natural and the chemical 
limonene in Lacroix is also an cockroach

651
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,030
insecticide.
Now,

652
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,043
one thing that I thought,
first of all when I heard that is just 

653
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:22,370
because it's toxic to cockroaches,
doesn't necessarily mean anything.

654
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,510
You hear shit like that all the time.
Like our neighbors,

655
00:35:24,511 --> 00:35:25,640
the vet,
he says,

656
00:35:25,641 --> 00:35:27,890
chewing gum,
artificial sweetening,

657
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:28,724
chewing gum is deadly poisonous to dogs.
Just because it's toxic to cockroach 

658
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:35,360
doesn't like.
That.

659
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:40,170
Seems like an effort to scare.
Like if it's dangerous to humans,

660
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,004
say that it's dangerous to cockroaches.
Cockroaches are gross and I have a 

661
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:48,930
mental image of dead cockroaches,
but it doesn't necessarily mean anything

662
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:49,764
besides that.
So that seems kind of manipulative 

663
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:52,650
headline.
So at first something,

664
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,950
what's going on here?
You know,

665
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,090
is this really about the ingredients or 
something else at play?

666
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,973
So let's actually break down these 
claims from the lawsuit who were making 

667
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:04,914
these claims.
All right,

668
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,550
let's start with the chemical Lemo Nini.
Am I saying that right?

669
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:10,430
Or am I just sound like an idiot?
A feeling?

670
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,120
You're not saying,
how could I?

671
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,043
It cannot be called limonene.
And then somebody for Christ sake help 

672
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:19,770
me.
I'll check gleam on any line.

673
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,200
One nine.
Oh Lima nine.

674
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,083
That's gotta be it.
That sounds way more intelligent in 

675
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,290
America.
And I'm so bad at pronounciating things.

676
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:29,950
It's like ridiculous.
Alignment nine,

677
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,380
I think it's Lima nine.
Damn.

678
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,273
You killed it.
You just read it like someone from 

679
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:35,140
outside of the US,
would it?

680
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,083
Well,
I'm sorry.

681
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,270
My brain is fucked up.
So pub cam,

682
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,343
the National Institutes of health open 
database for chemical compounds 

683
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:44,903
explicitly calls Lima Nine,
a naturally occurring chemical and a 

684
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:53,910
major component of oil extraction from 
citrus peels.

685
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,390
So sounds pretty natural,
right?

686
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,823
As the name suggests,
limonene is commonly used to give food 

687
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:06,360
or other products a lemony flavor and 
fragrance.

688
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,640
So it is a naturally occurring compound 
that comes off of lemons.

689
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,440
So Lima,
Lima Damn crushed it.

690
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,283
You're fucking spelling bee champ.
So how about the claims that it causes 

691
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:22,464
kidney toxicity and cancer while the 
same company pub cam also states there 

692
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:31,701
is inadequate evidence in humans for the
carcinogenic properties have limonene.

693
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,103
There is some evidence of male rats 
experiencing problems including tumors 

694
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,153
as a consequence of limonene exposure.
But none of those findings have been 

695
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:45,960
properly reproduced in humans.
Meanwhile,

696
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:51,030
more recent study suggests that limonene
is actually anti cancer.

697
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,140
It's lemon.
I mean it's a naturally occurring lemon.

698
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,153
Now,
how did this company come to claim that 

699
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,240
it's even unnatural?
Because I was reading that the FDA,

700
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,050
because everything that FDA does is so 
nebulous and undefined,

701
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:12,350
defines for whatever reason,
lemo nene as artificial flavor.

702
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,183
But according to this magazine,
and I don't know what the reason is for 

703
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:20,154
that.
Is it a naturally occurring chemical 

704
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,960
that comes from lemon?
Okay.

705
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:31,490
Now the other chemical that's being 
accused of being toxic is Lena Lou.

706
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,521
I.
Why?

707
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:33,870
Why can I not really?
You know,

708
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:34,704
Lou,
it's spelled L I n a l o l that's a 

709
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:38,254
goofy ass word.
Lena Lou as another additive used as a 

710
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:46,750
flavoring agent.
It's naturally occurring.

711
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,430
Found within many types of flowers.
Spice plants,

712
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,290
including the nights.
Yeah.

713
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,770
It includes meant centered herbs,
laurels,

714
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:57,604
and cinnamon.
It is most definitely used an 

715
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:02,290
insecticide as well.
That part is true,

716
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,450
but that doesn't mean it's poisonous to 
humans.

717
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,130
After all,
as I pointed out,

718
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,310
dogs can eat chocolate,
get I eat 20 bars a day.

719
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,160
Explain that you can't.

720
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,170
The only real toxic effects of Lena Lou 
has been documented to inflict on humans

721
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,490
is mild skin and eye irritation,
namely from air assault,

722
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,700
from air forms of the chemical being 
supported in your eyes.

723
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:28,880
For example,
take 11.

724
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,160
Squirt it in your eyes.
Oh,

725
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,530
I'm going to sue the lemon people.
No,

726
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:33,820
that's not how it works.
Folks.

727
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,890
Also,
coincidentally,

728
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:36,843
research suggests that it may be an 
anticancer ingredient that leaves only 

729
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:42,963
lionel prop property such as Lionel 
property and a proper proper property 

730
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,090
and a like back in fifth grade trying to
read again,

731
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,470
read to the class even.
Can you read a paragraph in front of the

732
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:03,304
class?
And it's like,

733
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,500
oh my God,
I can't remember half these words.

734
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,420
That leaves Lionel prep innate derived 
from plants like ginger and lavender and

735
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:14,560
another common flavoring and fragrance 
additive.

736
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,880
It has been shown to help inhibit the 
proliferation of prostate cancer.

737
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:19,714
I'm going to show those.
Wrap up my ass at least in the form of 

738
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:26,510
Nagani Kumquats.
Um,

739
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,100
uh,
so there you go.

740
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:36,210
So unless Lacroix is secretly including 
50 percent of the beverage as Lionel,

741
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,353
then drinkers don't have anything to 
fear because it's not even anywhere 

742
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:43,414
close to being harmful.
These are all naturally occurring 

743
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,370
flavors.
And by the way,

744
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,780
these are all flavors that many 
companies use and many of their products

745
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:53,614
to flavor their beverages.
I mean it makes it act like Lacroix is 

746
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:00,500
out there.
Just a pouring coke,

747
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,353
gross insecticide for no reason.
Like I'm going to save fifty cents and 

748
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:07,570
pour some pointed at as.
No.

749
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,720
This is a widely used flavoring agent 
that seems by all accounts to be natural

750
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:20,770
after all.
So what's going on here?

751
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,320
What is going on?
What is going on?

752
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,480
Let me say this.
Even water is toxic.

753
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:31,360
When you consume too much,
you can actually get water poisoning.

754
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,420
Okay?
No,

755
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:38,030
that's an incredible sued a water.
I'm assuming big water.

756
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,423
Now,
as somebody who's been on the receiving 

757
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,690
end of bogus lawsuits,
this place,

758
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,660
this lawsuit stinks to high.
Heck,

759
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,850
okay.
Now Mike Theory,

760
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,870
big soda is behind it and I.
That might sound like a joke,

761
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:57,710
but think about it.
The company Lacroix dominates,

762
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,550
dominates the market.
If you go to any grocery store,

763
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,460
any convenience store gets what's on the
shelf and guess what?

764
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:09,360
People want Lacroix every time.
Isla,

765
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,000
please.
Let's not get into that.

766
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:13,130
Now.
That's a whole nother heated debate.

767
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,860
Look,
they got a great marketing.

768
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,200
I don't know what.
I don't know how,

769
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:19,034
but they dominant like I've.
I've slammed Lacroix previously on the 

770
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:24,560
podcast was like these motherfuckers act
like they invented soda water,

771
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,373
but here I am drinking it every episode.
So what's going on now at the same time 

772
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:38,840
as Lacroix is killing it and I'm talking
about $827,000,000

773
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:39,674
in sales last year.
Guess what's simultaneously declining 

774
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,073
hugely and sales soda,
sugary drinks as people realize that 

775
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,420
consuming 50 grams of sugar is poison 
and not lie on the oil or whatever.

776
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,773
How about 50 grams of sugar?
Can we sue Coca Cola for giving me 

777
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:02,540
diabetes?
I'd like to.

778
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,773
Maybe I will.
So here we have lacroix dominating the 

779
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:11,450
market.
Big Soda falling down.

780
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,583
What's happening now?
The these big boys are losing market 

781
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:20,300
share to Lacroix and their soda water 
brands are are getting smashed,

782
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,570
they're dominating the market.
And these big soda companies,

783
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,200
they they need to get in because their 
business is suffering.

784
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,103
So to me from the outside,
it seems like a total hit job of 

785
00:43:36,361 --> 00:43:39,420
misinformation and the lawsuit is going 
to get thrown out.

786
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,853
You can trust me on that,
but the damage has already been done 

787
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,710
because I hear it on the news,
I see it on social media,

788
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,040
I see it everywhere at once.
And it stuck in your head.

789
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,043
I know.
And a know fucked up is that nobody 

790
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:54,330
goes,
nobody goes,

791
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,160
oh,
that's weird.

792
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,280
That doesn't make that much sense.
They say they go,

793
00:43:59,281 --> 00:44:01,470
what?
There's poison in Lacroix.

794
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,230
We're all fucking going to die.
We drink lacroix.

795
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,410
And they have successfully

796
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,733
tarnish the reputation of this pristine,
beautifully branded and naturally 

797
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:18,230
flavored sodie pop.
And that's it.

798
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:20,630
That's the beauty of this lawsuit.
It's totally bogus.

799
00:44:20,631 --> 00:44:21,464
It's going to get thrown out and they 
have tarnished the reputation and 

800
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:25,064
everybody's been taken the bait.
And meanwhile Mr Coca Cola has got his 

801
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:32,610
feet up and he's drinking lacroix.
He knows it's the security of beverage.

802
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,260
But meanwhile he's pedaling his fucking 
nasty coca cola bullshit.

803
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,120
So I say to all of our listeners,
all the [inaudible] boys out there,

804
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,313
crack open a lacroix,
have a sip and enjoy yourself and know 

805
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:50,400
that you are enjoying an all natural 
sugar free beverage.

806
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,350
And you are,
you are a lacroix boy.

807
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,680
Your Gazebo.
Boy,

808
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,520
you are my boy.
So have a sip and enjoy.

809
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,020
Cheers everybody.

810
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:04,763
Cheers.
Isla,

811
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,140
you really?
That's allowed 70 though.

812
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,150
I tried on purpose.
So that's it.

813
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:14,803
Nice to have bunked two big topics.
Sixty minutes is this 60 minutes 

814
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:21,903
colgate.
I was working on my Alex Jones 

815
00:45:23,661 --> 00:45:24,900
impression.
I thought it was pretty good.

816
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,010
I did it during one of the,
the uh,

817
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,350
copywriters,
but we cut it,

818
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,920
but I kind of want to do it now.
Kanye.

819
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:32,843
Kanye gave trump,
make America great hat during his White 

820
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,140
House visit.
And it really hurts my throat though.

821
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,253
It's pretty good.
I need to figure how to do it where it 

822
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:42,860
doesn't irritate my throat.
Yeah.

823
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,680
Kanye gave trump will make America great
hat during the White House visit.

824
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,610
Purple Hat.
You guys heard about all this?

825
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:53,710
Kanye west madness.
Um,

826
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,000
okay.
So let's talk about Kanye West.

827
00:45:56,001 --> 00:45:56,834
No good.
That Kanye met trump and we're going to 

828
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:04,190
talk about that,
but before we do in our intern,

829
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:06,350
who's a super fan of Kanye West says you
will know,

830
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:11,240
um,
had some suggestions for Kanye West last

831
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,073
week and our previous episode,
he had suggested that he make the hat 

832
00:46:18,321 --> 00:46:21,740
purple,
which would symbolize the joining of the

833
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:24,200
Democrats and the Republicans.
They're red and the blue.

834
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:27,470
Exactly.
Red And blue makes purple cares.

835
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,330
Here's Kanye and a purple hat.

836
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,670
Not Evidence of much.
Honestly,

837
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,880
we had thought that it said make America
great.

838
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,070
You can't really read it,
can you?

839
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,150
It doesn't say that though,

840
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,640
but interesting.
What does it say?

841
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,953
Showing up.
Inappropriate hat says exposed world 

842
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:52,930
says Ian because he knows those world,
but what he did,

843
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:53,853
and then his other suggestion in 
suggestion was don't wear a hat that 

844
00:46:56,811 --> 00:47:01,811
says make America great again.
Hat that says make America great.

845
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:07,310
Yeah.
And what happens later on that day,

846
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,030
my friends.
Well,

847
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,050
I can't open it some behind that 
picture.

848
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,900
It is,
yeah.

849
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:18,320
Good job.
He'll make America great.

850
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:20,330
This is,
I'm telling it now.

851
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,433
People have suspected that Kanye lurks 
the reddit of Kanye on Reddit and the 

852
00:47:26,601 --> 00:47:27,434
clip,
the highlight of and talking about it 

853
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,630
was that subreddit.
So there is a chance,

854
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:32,464
I swear to you now that Kanye West saw 
Ian suggestion and if he comes out with 

855
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:38,950
a purple,
make America great hat,

856
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:42,640
which is a great idea and I hope he does
the world.

857
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,410
Oh my God.
That is going to be amazing.

858
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,011
How well.
Well,

859
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:45,844
how,
how do you,

860
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,770
how did you feel in seeing this?
I saw you.

861
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:49,830
You seem pretty excited.
Yeah,

862
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,823
I mean I was pretty proud of myself.
Do you think that he saw your 

863
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:57,280
presentation?
I'm going to tell myself that.

864
00:47:57,281 --> 00:47:59,620
Yeah,
I hope you did.

865
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,320
Do you think there's a chance though,
or do you think.

866
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:05,710
I mean like not going to fully commit 
because it's not purple.

867
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:07,100
If it was purple,
I'd go he,

868
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,640
yeah,
but well,

869
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:10,503
based on a percentage out of 100,
what are the chances do you think you 

870
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:15,940
saw that your presentation,
the clip got a lot of views.

871
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:18,550
That was six days ago before he did 
that.

872
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,300
It's interesting timing and this looks 
like a shitty one.

873
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,340
Not like the design one.
He pooped it out real fast.

874
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:28,243
Yeah.
You could just buy a red hat and the 

875
00:48:29,801 --> 00:48:31,840
embroidery.
Can you give me a percentage?

876
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:36,250
Say 50.
Wow.

877
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,860
That's gotTa.
Make you feel amazing.

878
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,640
Oh yeah.
He better send me a hat.

879
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,570
That's the least he could do.
Look us up.

880
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,430
Wow.
I hope he takes.

881
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:56,260
Would you wear it in if it was purple 
and said make America Great.

882
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,790
What if it was a one?
If it's red,

883
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:59,610
he's like,
no,

884
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:03,640
I don't kind eat on the street.
I wouldn't wear it if it was red.

885
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:05,200
No,
if it was purple,

886
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:08,380
I feel like I kind of have to know what 
the fuck you can't.

887
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,360
Yeah.
I love that.

888
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:11,680
You wouldn't wear.
You wouldn't wear it.

889
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:13,991
Well.
Anyway,

890
00:49:13,991 --> 00:49:16,570
so there's that and so we all 
congratulate in.

891
00:49:16,571 --> 00:49:18,580
He's really grown up.
We're all very proud of him.

892
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,280
What the fuck going on?
We're all very proud of an intern.

893
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:24,740
He's really flourished.
He's turned into condos.

894
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,330
Personal advisor really just come into 
his own,

895
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:30,970
so I want to say thank you to end the 
intern.

896
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,730
He's great,
and when we first saw that purple hat,

897
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:35,600
there was that moment where we thought 
that was it.

898
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,720
That was a freak out.
That was like,

899
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:40,150
are you kidding me?
But 50 percent though,

900
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:41,610
Dan.
I mean that's nothing to be scoffed.

901
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,140
Yeah.
No,

902
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:45,400
I mean I think he's probably right.
I mean from what I understand,

903
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:45,761
yeah,
he,

904
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:48,040
he legitimately is like,
he's a worker.

905
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:48,973
He's on the Kanye Fan.
For how many points did it have on the 

906
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,590
rabbit in?
Well,

907
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,640
it wasn't on the,
reddit was on the fence.

908
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:58,480
Oh Man.
Forum.

909
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,733
And how was it received?
A people were onboard connecting 

910
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:08,350
everyone to shit on me and yeah,
that would be interesting.

911
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,060
Well maybe not him personally,
but you know,

912
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:16,860
I bet some of his handlers probably do 
check out,

913
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:20,000
you know,
let's just go,

914
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,120
go,
let's go with that.

915
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,170
Wow.
That's,

916
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,020
that's really exciting.
Well,

917
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:29,200
did you out your user name then if you 
posted our wellness?

918
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,490
Someone else posted it?
Yeah.

919
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:32,243
Yeah,
he's still clear your alerts on the 

920
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,650
them,
you didn't post it.

921
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:40,220
Did you end up denying it?
Fuck,

922
00:50:40,221 --> 00:50:42,240
it was definitely y'all know his 
account.

923
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,710
Um,
but anyway,

924
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,210
so Kanye met with trump and there's a 
lot of blow back as you can expect,

925
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:56,110
but I'm here to focus on the funny,
the whimsical,

926
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,223
the comedic.

927
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:58,983
Um,

928
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,400
so here's,
here's

929
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,293
one great moment.

930
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,973
Um,

931
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,910
you can see Kanye password on his phone 
came in.

932
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:12,411
I was like,
Ian,

933
00:51:12,411 --> 00:51:13,244
what's funniest password?
And he's like just zeros as I come in 

934
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:19,850
and he's like five,
like you're fucking crazy to six 67.

935
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:20,521
Six.
Okay.

936
00:51:20,521 --> 00:51:21,880
Yeah,
you said 5:10,

937
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:26,890
but I guess he's revised his.
He said he went back into and this whole

938
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:30,704
thing,

939
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:39,220
ellen on one of his legendary I airplane
the airplane.

940
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:44,200
We have a picture that but trump card.
Interesting cognition.

941
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,043
Just going off for like 20 minutes and 
dominating the conversation and I find 

942
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:50,430
it just so interesting that,
oh,

943
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,870
how do I get that Angle Bac this angle 
here?

944
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:59,020
He doesn't really look at trump when 
he's talking and trumps faith.

945
00:51:59,030 --> 00:51:59,863
Is he just sitting there kind of 
embracing this angle is all is in the 

946
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:07,430
one I wanted for Christ sake.
What else?

947
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:12,431
We got up?
Kanye is a smart as tesla and Freud.

948
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,400
See if ben can decode this.

949
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,560
I was conducted with a neuropsychologist
that works,

950
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,113
Matt,

951
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:27,080
but the athletes in the NBA,
the NFL,

952
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,120
and he looked at my brain,
go ahead,

953
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,790
drop some bombs for you.
Ninety eight percent top out you test.

954
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,550
I had a 75 percentile of all human 
beings,

955
00:52:37,551 --> 00:52:40,390
but it was counting eight numbers 
backwards afterwards.

956
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,810
Repeat something going to work on that 
one.

957
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:45,340
The other one's 98 percent tesla.
Freud,

958
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,180
you know,
so

959
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,090
I guess he's trying to say he's very 
intelligent.

960
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:55,973
Am I correct in that?
And he's definitely coming across that 

961
00:52:57,991 --> 00:53:02,991
way.
And you're not commenting really.

962
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,440
I think he's pursuing his words,
but uh,

963
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,650
he's got the whole forum listening on 
everyday.

964
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:14,220
Things got so complicated for men.
You know what I'm saying?

965
00:53:14,221 --> 00:53:19,080
Like you can't just take tuck his 
opinion anymore.

966
00:53:19,081 --> 00:53:19,914
He's a leader.
He's a thought leader on it by his PR 

967
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:24,420
and influencer.
I know what you need to pr now.

968
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:30,150
Can't have the.
He's got a reputation now.

969
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,360
He doesn't have some bullshit username 
he's faced.

970
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:35,220
They know who he is.
He has a reputation.

971
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:39,380
If he says the wrong thing,
this called Bob's coming from.

972
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,920
Yeah.
This goes beyond username.

973
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:43,100
This is real shit.
Well,

974
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,940
Ian,
can you at least confirm he's,

975
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,890
he's trying to say that he is 
intelligent.

976
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,390
Yeah,
that's the general idea.

977
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,050
Yeah.
I mean it's once again,

978
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:54,390
like the powerpoint where I showed all 
the people you can compare themselves,

979
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,680
surprises,
Freud and a tesla.

980
00:53:57,681 --> 00:53:58,730
Wasn't the in there.

981
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,540
And who was the,
uh,

982
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,950
the Disney character.
Oh,

983
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:06,230
that's vanilla pea von sweets,
sweets.

984
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,780
He should have said,
I'm like sweet.

985
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:14,760
Then as counting eight numbers.
Gosh,

986
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,613
we're gonna work on it.
And we were working on not doing the 

987
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:24,300
math anyway,
the other one's 98 percent tests.

988
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,770
Look Freud,
you know,

989
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:30,650
so he knows,
say confidence,

990
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,300
you know what I'm saying?
But anyway,

991
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:35,670
so that was the number one rock star on 
the planet.

992
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:40,790
So that was interesting.
And then there was the one,

993
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,013
I guess the one that really pissed 
people off was that he hugged trump at 

994
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:51,801
the end and we saw this doctor or this 
and this isn't God.

995
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,860
He showed him a picture of what does 
this even in hell.

996
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,550
Yeah.
And decode.

997
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,423
It's not his design.
He took it from someone who did it as 

998
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:08,390
they're a university thesis a few years 
ago,

999
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,790
and the guy,
they asked him,

1000
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:12,020
they were like,
what do you think about this?

1001
00:55:12,021 --> 00:55:12,854
He's like,
I think it's got a cool that Connie saw 

1002
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:17,120
it.
He didn't care that I have no idea how.

1003
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,433
So what are the chances we're going to 
get this air force one made in zero 

1004
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:22,154
percent.
Okay.

1005
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,233
Alright.
Hater form's gonna eat you alive for 

1006
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:31,721
that one.
So bring back that picture.

1007
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:37,200
You love them all wearing hats.
Yeah.

1008
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,071
Connie,
I gave.

1009
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:41,020
Um,
I wanna see I wanna.

1010
00:55:41,021 --> 00:55:43,100
See Jared Kushner.
He looks like such a Dweeb.

1011
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:46,763
Um,
you can see the whole family here and 

1012
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,700
one says,
make earth the greatest again.

1013
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:58,020
Make earth great again.
Earth is like,

1014
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,120
don't talk for me.
It says,

1015
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,313
yeah,
I know jared cracks make earth grade 

1016
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:05,100
again.
And travel space again.

1017
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,980
Make Earth grade again.
What does that mean?

1018
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:08,843
One was earth.

1019
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,830
Earth used to be fucking dope when the 
dinosaurs were around,

1020
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,340
maybe played out,
played out,

1021
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,680
and it would carry.
It looked so uncomfortable in that hat,

1022
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:21,940
man.
But they're,

1023
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,770
they're making them work,
they're rocking it,

1024
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:25,470
they're making it work.
What's the Blue Ones Day?

1025
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:28,070
That's the earth.
That's the black line.

1026
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,420
Says travel space again.
So you can,

1027
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:34,470
you can get that out,
get that out of there.

1028
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,290
So then we've got the hug,
the notorious hug,

1029
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:41,620
which apparently now I was like in what?
Because they're,

1030
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:45,910
the backlash has been so severe and I've
read some things like Tei,

1031
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,250
the famous rapper,
what he wrote.

1032
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,630
I was like,
damn,

1033
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:50,464
that is fucking harsh.
And their friends on my read it for you 

1034
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:55,840
guys.
But I was like,

1035
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:56,703
Ian,
what?

1036
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:00,010
What exactly did he say that that upset 
people so much.

1037
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,530
And what in?
Well,

1038
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,630
in you want to say what you told me?
Or is that too controversial?

1039
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,980
I don't remember that.
He didn't say anything new.

1040
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:09,823
It was kind of the same antics.
It's the same content from the last six 

1041
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:17,680
months.
But I guess what happened is he showed a

1042
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:21,550
lot of love and he hugged trump and 
that's what set people off.

1043
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:24,650
So extend them together and made it all 
medium.

1044
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:26,223
So here it is.

1045
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:30,430
Well that I like and I guess they liked 
me and we're going to have lunch.

1046
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:35,431
We're gonna talk.
You don't want to take.

1047
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:39,310
I don't want to put you in that spot,
but standing in that spot.

1048
00:57:39,311 --> 00:57:40,550
I love this guy right here.

1049
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,610
I did the secret service.
Not tackled his ass right now.

1050
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,650
I love this.

1051
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:55,093
Got You.
It was all a long call and there was 

1052
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:03,670
like a plot to a movie like that where 
he tries to get close to the king.

1053
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,790
Some Kung Fu movie hero.
Yeah.

1054
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:08,710
That movie's sick.
What did it make sense of?

1055
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:11,890
Konya was like the star of his own hero 
and he just stabbed trump.

1056
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,220
That'd be a wild twit.
Everyone's like,

1057
00:58:15,221 --> 00:58:16,054
whoa,

1058
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:20,743
no,
but he didn't.

1059
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:21,823
He didn't stab him

1060
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:22,703
and it gave him some love and in fact 
that probably ruined the moment for you 

1061
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,200
guys.
So let me go back.

1062
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,253
I have a bad habit of pausing and 
talking a lot and isla was trying to 

1063
00:58:31,631 --> 00:58:33,520
correct me,
but it was too late.

1064
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:34,354
I already paused it.
So here we go again for everyone to 

1065
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:37,120
enjoy.

1066
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,953
Well,
people that I like and I guess they 

1067
00:58:39,601 --> 00:58:42,240
liked me and we're going to have lunch.
We're going to talk.

1068
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:48,090
I don't want to take.
I don't want to put you in that spot,

1069
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:50,431
dude.
I'm sorry.

1070
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:51,264
I got to get all these people.
There's so many people from so many 

1071
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,200
press.
It's actually really annoying.

1072
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:01,470
You can't even hear what they're saying.
Cameras that can take pictures.

1073
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,304
Do you need.
What the fuck does she know about 

1074
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:06,180
cameras?
Taylor?

1075
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,540
I'm.
Yeah.

1076
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,890
Okay.
I'm not going to pause it anymore.

1077
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:13,680
That's fine.
I love this guy right here.

1078
00:59:13,681 --> 00:59:18,570
Let me get this.
I love this guy right here.

1079
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:21,703
Really

1080
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:23,563
hard.
I didn't want to put you in that 

1081
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:24,800
present.
There you go.

1082
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:26,523
Okay,
now let me read the response to the 

1083
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:31,160
flavor.
The reaction.

1084
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,833
This,
uh,

1085
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:35,310
this was cold blooded man.
This,

1086
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:36,530
this,
you know what happened?

1087
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,364
He got

1088
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:40,170
go.
Sarah did.

1089
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:44,550
I was trying to.
He got ghost started by a t I.

1090
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,910
and do you agree this was a ghost 
starting?

1091
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:49,270
Yeah,
it was a good start.

1092
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,050
Definitely goes right.
So let me read this shit now.

1093
00:59:52,051 --> 00:59:52,884
I've been extremely patient and made it 
a point to not jump to any premature 

1094
00:59:55,561 --> 00:59:56,394
conclusions about you and his antics,
partially due to the lessons learned 

1095
00:59:59,131 --> 01:00:01,830
from the outcome of other similar 
situation dealing with my brother Wayne,

1096
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,260
which I mailed him mishandled a bit in 
hindsight,

1097
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:09,500
but now this shit is next level 
futuristic sambo hopping Bob Steven off.

1098
01:00:11,491 --> 01:00:13,590
Django ass shit.
What does that mean in

1099
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,360
those are all references to.
It's sort of like the,

1100
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,040
the uncle Tom thing.
What a sambo.

1101
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,391
Uh,
that was,

1102
01:00:21,391 --> 01:00:22,224
uh,
it was a book that had like very racist 

1103
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:26,460
imagery,
I believe.

1104
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,470
I'm not exactly sure,
but then he refers to Django,

1105
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:30,120
which obviously that was the term Tina 
movie.

1106
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,613
Sure.
Okay.

1107
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,680
Literary references very,
uh,

1108
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,020
eyebrow.
You know,

1109
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:38,910
from what I can gather,
this is the most repulsive,

1110
01:00:38,911 --> 01:00:39,744
disgraceful,
embarrassing act of desperation and 

1111
01:00:41,611 --> 01:00:45,030
auction off of one solid again,
power I've ever seen.

1112
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:46,763
Now I recall you asking me to come with 
you to have this meeting and I declined 

1113
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,310
naturally,
but bro,

1114
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,033
if ain't time,
I would've been in there with you and 

1115
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,490
you behave that spinelessly in my 
presence.

1116
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:59,200
I feel I'd be compelled to slap the fuck
out of you,

1117
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:01,290
Bro,
for the people you asked,

1118
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,390
kissing and boot licking on a whole new 
level,

1119
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:08,460
and I refused to associate myself with 
something so vile week and inconsiderate

1120
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,420
to the effect this has on the greater 
good of all of our people.

1121
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,360
I'm a true believer in it ain't what you
do,

1122
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:20,160
it's how you do it and this shit is 
regurgitating at one time.

1123
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:20,994
It was a pleasure to work alongside you.
Now I'm ashamed to have been associated 

1124
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,480
with you.
To all the people who follow.

1125
01:01:27,481 --> 01:01:29,730
You.
Use the Yay.

1126
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,620
Oh fuck.
Yay.

1127
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,780
Right?
Yes.

1128
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:37,670
Kanye was not part of a former.
Anything of people.

1129
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,770
Don't judge,
so other people will follow.

1130
01:01:40,771 --> 01:01:41,700
Yay.
Musically,

1131
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:44,280
socially,
or even personally who are confused,

1132
01:01:44,281 --> 01:01:45,950
heartbroken and fear.
Eat.

1133
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,990
Let me make this clear.
This shit ain't cool.

1134
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,900
This is all in caps.
This is a movie made.

1135
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:53,780
Yay.
Yes.

1136
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:55,680
Yay.
Made for Yay.

1137
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,880
This is a play to put him in position.
He'd liked to see himself in.

1138
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:03,660
We are not on his mind as he makes these
comments in decisions.

1139
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:08,490
Don't follow this puppet where we're off
caps now because as long as I've lived,

1140
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,324
I've learned that it benefits a man.
Nothing at all to gain the world if to 

1141
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:14,220
do so,
he must lose his soul.

1142
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,850
We just saw Mr.
West soul on auction.

1143
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:18,923
If you listen closely,
can hear the tears of our ancestors hit 

1144
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:26,130
the floor.
All I can say is I've reached my limit.

1145
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,040
This is my stop.
I'm officially done.

1146
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:32,130
Middle Finger trump and his little cooky
boy.

1147
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:37,830
Wow.
That's cold blooded shit.

1148
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:38,693
How did,
how did you,

1149
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:41,970
how did that make you feel in.
I mean,

1150
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:42,804
I,
I can't fully weigh in on what that 

1151
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:48,360
imagery feels like or to see that if 
you're,

1152
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,970
you know,
uh,

1153
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:52,590
African American in this country.
I don't know.

1154
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:55,430
So yeah,
I,

1155
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:59,640
I completely understand it.
I see why he would have that.

1156
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:01,410
And you know,
I respect his opinion.

1157
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:02,244
They're very political.
One t I did from what I understand was 

1158
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,990
like his most ardent defender up to this
point,

1159
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:14,210
is that true in opinion is working on 
campaigning now.

1160
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:16,543
It's a tough situation for them.
I can only imagine that's got it as if 

1161
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:21,880
I'm calling you for.
Yeah,

1162
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,980
that's good.
When I read it and it's hard to disagree

1163
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:29,820
when this stuff that saying so I don't 
know.

1164
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:32,970
Like we said last time,
like you can see what kind of was trying

1165
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:37,890
to do,
but in it's not a pure art movement.

1166
01:03:37,891 --> 01:03:41,040
It's bullet,
political and then it should be.

1167
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,170
I guess it's,
it's just so polarizing.

1168
01:03:43,171 --> 01:03:44,004
It's like on one hand I see where he's 
coming from and on the other hand I see 

1169
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:49,374
the black community as seeing Donald 
Trump as a symbol of oppression of 

1170
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,280
establishment or whatever.

1171
01:03:59,130 --> 01:03:59,963
Yeah.
No,

1172
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,520
but I also see like,
I dunno,

1173
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:03,413
I see it from both sides.
I can't really think he's going to try 

1174
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:08,900
and run for president to.
I don't think so.

1175
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,930
Fucking cringey Bro.
Please.

1176
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,330
No,
not support.

1177
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:17,170
And do you vote for Kanye would never 
vote for it because I liked it.

1178
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:21,030
Doesn't that kind of run everything?
What is.

1179
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:25,240
So if he's read love is president or is 
it just as he.

1180
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,990
Is he just trying to get political?
What is this?

1181
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:31,520
Is he trying to be genuine and spread 
love and like bridge the divide or.

1182
01:04:31,521 --> 01:04:32,354
So you just want to run for president 
positioning himself because that's what 

1183
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:37,080
Tai was saying and I was like,
yeah.

1184
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,470
And the conversation was very like about
Kanye,

1185
01:04:40,471 --> 01:04:43,680
like it was talking about yeezy and 
Adidas and how now.

1186
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,270
So strange lands are a billion.
Oh yeah,

1187
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,290
no.
Yeah.

1188
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:51,420
And it's Kinda like,
what is the conversation with Kanye?

1189
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:52,403
Watching his rent strikes me very much 
as somebody who is having a manic 

1190
01:04:58,681 --> 01:04:59,514
episode,
he's been diagnosed as bipolar and when 

1191
01:05:02,311 --> 01:05:03,144
I see him talking there,
he strikes me as someone that's not 

1192
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,820
fully grounded,
you know what I'm saying?

1193
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:12,390
And so I take that into consideration 
too.

1194
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,120
Yeah.
And Mike,

1195
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:15,023
he's feeling strong more than usual 
emotions because he's in this manic 

1196
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:20,830
state.
And so he's like,

1197
01:05:20,831 --> 01:05:24,520
I love trump.
I love what he represents as someone who

1198
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:28,660
did something that was impossible,
I love what the idea of what he's trying

1199
01:05:28,661 --> 01:05:31,510
to do of like bringing jobs back to 
America and America first.

1200
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:35,200
Right?
Kanye sees that as he just sees the best

1201
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:36,034
in it.
He sees the positive message and he 

1202
01:05:37,151 --> 01:05:39,610
doesn't and there's a lot of people that
criticize that movement,

1203
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:40,593
but he just,
he's full with strong emotions in love 

1204
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:46,030
and this manic state and so that's,
he's not,

1205
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:51,550
he's not being smart.
He's being emotional and so it's like A.

1206
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,500
Y'all really says that it was it in the 
snl speech.

1207
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,740
He straight up says like,
we need to start thinking with our minds

1208
01:05:57,741 --> 01:05:59,060
and start thinking with our hearts.

1209
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,770
So I think he's just,
he's not an A.

1210
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,053
I don't think he's grounded right home 
and apparently or well we are noticing 

1211
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:12,503
earlier he talks about how he was 
misdiagnosed as bipolar and he was just 

1212
01:06:15,451 --> 01:06:16,284
sleep deprived and so he's off his 
medicine and I'm watching this and be 

1213
01:06:18,691 --> 01:06:19,021
like,
dude,

1214
01:06:19,021 --> 01:06:22,380
you must be really sleep deprived right 
now if that's the case.

1215
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,550
So I don't know.
The whole thing is just wild and weird.

1216
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:30,980
Is he going to run as a republican 
because that's kind of what he's angling

1217
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,320
for.
Independent.

1218
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:37,230
He might just try and do his own thing.
What a circus.

1219
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:41,740
That would be a real circus.
Maybe he wants vp trump.

1220
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:44,230
Kanye.
Won't that be a wild world?

1221
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:45,823
God.
So that is Kanye decoded here on 60 

1222
01:06:48,911 --> 01:06:49,744
minutes.

1223
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:55,860
Rockstar heavy shit.

1224
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,320

1227
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:11,380
I say Fuck No.
Get that shit on sale.

1228
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,190
Little Cooky boy,
Aka Kanye West.

1229
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:18,760
That doesn't sound good.
Oh,

1230
01:07:18,761 --> 01:07:20,040
I can't say that.
Is that racist?

1231
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:23,050
No.
Wait little cookie by racist.

1232
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:29,340
He did throw that in while listing off 
like Samba and all those other things.

1233
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:30,760
I,
I've never heard of that one either.

1234
01:07:30,761 --> 01:07:34,430
I didn't know that was a racist thing is
that he just ran into him.

1235
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:39,930
He said he was a smart cookie.
I was exonerated.

1236
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:42,723
So hit me with that.
Sixty minutes is Kanye west trump's 

1237
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:47,344
little cooky boy.
Find out today under the Gazebo and 

1238
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:52,840
better help.
Is it a scam?

1239
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:55,390
Some say yes.
Some say no.

1240
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:57,290
Cockroaches.
I like that.

1241
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:58,780
A Nazi or whatever.
Yeah.

1242
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:02,020
I love the noncommittal.
Always hear it down here.

1243
01:08:02,021 --> 01:08:02,854
The craziest clickbait on the news.
They go see there's an outbreak of the 

1244
01:08:06,671 --> 01:08:08,900
flu.
Should you be concerned?

1245
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:14,100
Find out like universally when they say 
that it just,

1246
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,750
it means it means no.
No,

1247
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,770
you shouldn't.
Imagine if the answer's yes.

1248
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:19,753
Yes.
You should not leave your house a bolas 

1249
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,010
back.
The black plague is rampant.

1250
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,090
Yes,
we.

1251
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,170
What else we got,
man.

1252
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:36,910
Everyone having fun on this Friday.

1253
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:43,210
Find out more tonight.
Is Kanye trump's little cooky boy?

1254
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,233
Yes.
The answer is we should watch this pro 

1255
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:52,570
life lady.
Oh,

1256
01:08:52,571 --> 01:08:53,404
you want to watch that?
Yeah,

1257
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:56,090
we've got a lot of stuff.
But ilos got suggestion,

1258
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:58,330
so let's watch it.
You guys may have seen this great little

1259
01:08:58,331 --> 01:09:00,880
one pro life lady,
man,

1260
01:09:00,881 --> 01:09:04,720
roundhouse kicks pro life woman.
This shit's crazy,

1261
01:09:04,721 --> 01:09:05,850
man.
I love this.

1262
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:08,170
This is why we're here.
My dudes.

1263
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,101
5 million.
Wow.

1264
01:09:09,101 --> 01:09:10,840
This went viral.
Look at his outfit.

1265
01:09:10,841 --> 01:09:11,674
First of all,
he's got boots for kicking and that's 

1266
01:09:15,641 --> 01:09:18,310
just what he'll do.
No spoilers.

1267
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,173
Imagine kicking somebody.
Just imagine kicking somebody like how 

1268
01:09:23,081 --> 01:09:25,780
fucking unstable that you have to be to 
throw a kick.

1269
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:30,200
I have I ever kicked anyone who can.
Like,

1270
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:35,290
if you're not enough UFC fighting rings.
There's no like throwing a kick.

1271
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:35,931
Like,
who are you?

1272
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:36,764
Bruce?
Lee,

1273
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:50,360
what?
Hey,

1274
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:53,983
destruction of private property,
you get raped by somebody and they're 

1275
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:00,400
like,
hi,

1276
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,480
I'm a 16 year old and I can have this

1277
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:07,150
really compelling.
I am pro choice by the way,

1278
01:10:07,151 --> 01:10:09,760
for I'm.
I'm strongly in favor of pro choice.

1279
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,370
I'm just going to say that for the 
record.

1280
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,460
Okay,
and if you think that makes me a cook or

1281
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:16,294
whatever,
that's fine because we can have a 

1282
01:10:17,231 --> 01:10:19,780
difference in opinion.
I respect that you are pro life.

1283
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:22,450
How about that?
You fucking haters.

1284
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,260
You can have an opinion and I can have a
different opinion.

1285
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:27,940
Do you want to come to my dressing?
Kill me because I'm pro choice.

1286
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:35,070
Suck my tiny Jewish Dick.
But this guy's a fucking idiot.

1287
01:10:35,591 --> 01:10:36,730
So it's fun to watch.

1288
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:40,973
It's a baby.
Get someone who was raped and she gave 

1289
01:10:42,841 --> 01:10:44,820
birth and she decided to kill her

1290
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:45,813
by the way.
Oh,

1291
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:48,750
Holy Shit.
No,

1292
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:53,530
I did the perfect.
I just wanted to say like people who are

1293
01:10:53,531 --> 01:10:54,364
pro life,
I understand their point because it 

1294
01:10:56,490 --> 01:11:00,460
comes from a religious place and they 
think you're murdering a baby.

1295
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:03,730
I personally disagree.
I don't think you're murdering a baby,

1296
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:04,743
but if you did think that,
then I can understand how you get and 

1297
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:13,090
why would you be so passionate about it.
So it's like it's just slick.

1298
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:15,080
Unsolvable.
Yeah,

1299
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,850
it's killing babies.
Killing babies.

1300
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:21,810
It's like,
I can't think of two more opposites.

1301
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,870
Killing a baby.
Worse thing ever.

1302
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:27,680
Not killing a baby,
you know?

1303
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:31,620
I don't think it's killing baby.
This guy certainly doesn't.

1304
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:35,870
You got to go back a little because I 
think this guy should have been aborted.

1305
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:36,803
Oof,
oof

1306
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,900
child.

1307
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,190
I met the kick your phone.
Okay,

1308
01:11:50,191 --> 01:11:53,850
well who does that imagine kicking 
someone's phone?

1309
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:58,940
It's still assault defendant.
He doesn't really apologize either.

1310
01:11:59,311 --> 01:12:01,500
He's just like,
I fucked up.

1311
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:05,700
I kicked you in the face or phone.
Look at that tongue out.

1312
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:11,370
It's like an animated movie.
I can probably run with his arms back.

1313
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,320
I didn't kill her three year old child.

1314
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,930
He rounds up,
baby.

1315
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:22,340
Take your swaying hip into it.
Here we go.

1316
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:24,950
That's basically a warning shot.
You know,

1317
01:12:24,951 --> 01:12:29,951
you heard in world war two and World War
Two and Israel does it over like Gaza.

1318
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,030
They'll drop leaflets and say,
Hey,

1319
01:12:32,031 --> 01:12:33,710
we're about to bomb this place.
Get better.

1320
01:12:33,711 --> 01:12:35,750
Get Out.
That's what he's doing.

1321
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:38,640
Dropping leaflets on,
hey,

1322
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,473
it's about to go down.
Can you say that you clear the area 

1323
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,240
because a bomb is about to drop.

1324
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:49,863
Oh,
wow.

1325
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:56,080
That's a crazy kick.
I doubt that guy will,

1326
01:12:56,371 --> 01:13:00,490
as much power to be frank.
Can we slow motion?

1327
01:13:00,491 --> 01:13:01,324
Not here.

1328
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:03,610
Let's,
let's go to point two five on this.

1329
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:07,250
Break it down.
Um,

1330
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:09,520
speed point two,
five.

1331
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:11,210
Let's enjoy.
Okay,

1332
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,233
go ahead.

1333
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:18,320
Oh,
that sounds cool.

1334
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:20,163
Let's make it about it.
I love how the conversation is over and 

1335
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,810
very powerful.
I'm like,

1336
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,300
he probably doesn't have a lot of muscle
mass,

1337
01:13:33,301 --> 01:13:35,580
but he runs a well formed kick right 
there.

1338
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,420
Sounds a towel.

1339
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:43,740
There you go.
Everyone enjoyed that one.

1340
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:47,770
That was a favorite of the week.
Uh,

1341
01:13:47,771 --> 01:13:50,230
Shane continues his documentary about 
Jake Paul.

1342
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:53,680
I don't have that much to say about any 
of his new series except for this.

1343
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,180
This was my favorite detail that came 
out of the new episode.

1344
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:00,400
It's a small little detail,
but I thought it was great.

1345
01:14:00,401 --> 01:14:05,090
I'll share it for you guys.
Now what?

1346
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:11,380
What's the school bus?
So my dad's

1347
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,520
a good old Greg Paul.
It's actually like an rv though.

1348
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,740
I'm going to give you a quick tour and 
the bus give you an update.

1349
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:20,290
It's like you can like renovate.
Yeah,

1350
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:21,124
there's like a.
there's like a bed in there and he 

1351
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:27,250
drives around and like he sleeps in 
there.

1352
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:28,563
My Dad,

1353
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,220
his dad has lived at the 10th one house 
per months,

1354
01:14:32,221 --> 01:14:35,560
sleeping and a school van outside the 
house.

1355
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:36,483
Now a guy who's been accused of having 
sex with underage girls and kissing 

1356
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:44,020
underage girls on camera should not be 
sleeping in a school bus outside a house

1357
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:45,670
with a bunch of young kids.
All right,

1358
01:14:45,671 --> 01:14:47,920
Greg Ball.
Get your fucking shit together.

1359
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:48,933
Get your life together and get the 
fucking move out of the school bus for 

1360
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:52,510
Christ's sake.
Greg.

1361
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:54,400
What the Hell is wrong with you

1362
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,920
as a Weirdo?
I love that.

1363
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:00,023
Yeah.

1364
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,480
Weirdest.
God Damn Shit.

1365
01:15:03,481 --> 01:15:05,800
I read Paul,
man.

1366
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:08,610
Walk me your life together,
man.

1367
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:14,940
God,
that's it.

1368
01:15:14,941 --> 01:15:16,410
That's my uh,
that's my takeaway.

1369
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,233
Banksy.
Shreds is art and whatever some 

1370
01:15:20,611 --> 01:15:22,050
bullshit.
Should I talk about this?

1371
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:25,330
See Shreds his art.

1372
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:31,920
It's kind of cool except it was kind of 
also lane if I'm being honest because.

1373
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:36,820
Well here let's watch video.
So banksy sold a piece of art or.

1374
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:37,870
No,
he didn't sell.

1375
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:41,650
I don't know how came to be in the front
of his art.

1376
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:43,720
So he sold it originally and then it was
recently.

1377
01:15:43,721 --> 01:15:44,554
I don't know.
Sorry.

1378
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,340
Yeah,
I believe in being auctioned.

1379
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:52,060
I think the story goes that he built the
shredder into it.

1380
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:55,800
I'm like 10 years ago with the intention
that it,

1381
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:58,180
if it ever went on auction he would do 
this.

1382
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,193
So this is like a long con,
but what I'm wondering is if he is so 

1383
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:06,010
anti capitalist,
he originally sold the art to somebody.

1384
01:16:06,011 --> 01:16:07,540
Right?
Like how did the auction house get it?

1385
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:11,710
That's a very good question.
I mean the guy is rich.

1386
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:13,810
Very rich.
Okay.

1387
01:16:13,811 --> 01:16:15,070
So I don't really understand.

1388
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,960
Okay.
So it's not really a.

1389
01:16:16,961 --> 01:16:18,670
is it a statement?
I'm not sure.

1390
01:16:18,671 --> 01:16:21,700
What was the statement?
Just to gag.

1391
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:23,710
Gotcha.
Okay.

1392
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,050
It's like,
just like an actual quilt prank.

1393
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:31,170
I thought he was like an anticapitalist 
didn't sell his work kind of thing.

1394
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,410
Someone explicitly,
he doesn't sell his work,

1395
01:16:35,411 --> 01:16:36,244
like I remember hearing a story about 
how someone had a bunch of his work on 

1396
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:39,574
display and they were charging him to 
get in and he was super unhappy about 

1397
01:16:41,921 --> 01:16:42,754
that because you can buy prints over the
art and I'm sure Monday won't go so 

1398
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:48,873
well.
I don't know much about him so nobody 

1399
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:51,993
knows.

1400
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:53,583
Right.

1401
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:57,040
That's some.
That's what I think.

1402
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:02,620
Just I just had to blast you with those.
All right,

1403
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:05,223
so here we go.

1404
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:15,170
In a thread into the brain

1405
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:24,020
and there you have it.
Years later sold for one point $4,

1406
01:17:24,521 --> 01:17:29,521
million dollar they're adopting and,
and the minute it closes somebody with a

1407
01:17:36,571 --> 01:17:37,404
real mode activated it.
Who was there not that a big ass smile 

1408
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:45,930
on it.
It's a shame.

1409
01:17:45,931 --> 01:17:50,931
It didn't complete it because they were 
able to preserve it.

1410
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,960
So that's why I think like it's done

1411
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:56,853
so beautifully to the,
like the paper didn't get crumbled or 

1412
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:00,310
anything.
It's just like.

1413
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:03,520
So is it?
So again that's my question is about his

1414
01:18:03,521 --> 01:18:07,810
intention because I don't think his 
intention was to destroy it

1415
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:11,770
because it only shreds half.
And then it stopped.

1416
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,860
I think it's a statement because she 
just,

1417
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:19,790
someone just paid one point 4 million 
for this up since he did it.

1418
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,433
So now,
not only is it a valuable piece of 

1419
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:25,580
history,
I know it's part of his theory of art.

1420
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:28,670
I mean it's pretty cool that he pulled 
that off.

1421
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,043
I'm just confused about the message 
because it increased the value and it 

1422
01:18:32,931 --> 01:18:35,300
seemed like he intentionally didn't 
destroy the whole painting.

1423
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,140
I don't care that much and I don't think
it matters that much.

1424
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:43,520
I think it was still a cool moment.
People were freaking out,

1425
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:46,070
like all of a sudden this paper 
shredding itself.

1426
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:47,490
Right?
Well,

1427
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:50,540
it's possible.
It was an intentional that it fucked up.

1428
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:52,850
Like if he really built this thing 10 
years ago,

1429
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:53,763
like malfunction,
I'm sharing you that this would raise 

1430
01:18:56,271 --> 01:18:59,450
the volume just because that's how art 
goes that moment.

1431
01:18:59,451 --> 01:19:01,460
That never happened before.
So yeah.

1432
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:05,130
I mean it's brilliant.
It's brilliant that long.

1433
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:09,860
You waited patiently for 10 years for 
this beautiful model where some idiot,

1434
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:11,570
I don't want to call them an idiot.

1435
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,320
I'll put it this way.
Kurt Vonnegut,

1436
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:18,170
I love this saying,
and I'm not talking,

1437
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:19,700
you can spend 10,
20,

1438
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:22,080
$30,000
on a piece of art and culture,

1439
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,230
but when you start spending like 
millions,

1440
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,290
you're paying for prestige,
right?

1441
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:32,120
Yeah.
Kurt vonnegut has this great quote.

1442
01:19:32,121 --> 01:19:37,121
He says,
art is a conspiracy between the rich and

1443
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,540
and like the,
uh,

1444
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:41,330
end the art world to make.
I said,

1445
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:43,770
that's so bad to make people feel 
stupid.

1446
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,653
Or is it a conspiracy between rich 
people and artist to make poor people 

1447
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:47,534
feel stupid because you see a painting 
sold for 20 million bucks and you're 

1448
01:19:51,051 --> 01:19:52,760
making $30,000
a year and you're like,

1449
01:19:52,761 --> 01:19:53,594
what the fuck?
Now the funny stories that some other 

1450
01:19:56,741 --> 01:20:01,741
guy who owns a print shredded it carries
more weight,

1451
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:06,840
is do we have a picture of that?
Oh,

1452
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:09,350
that's funny.
We have A.

1453
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,673
I want to see that is hilarious.
Was that a valuable print before of 

1454
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:17,640
$40,000?
So why the fuck?

1455
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:19,710
Like what did he take a scissor to it?

1456
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:22,000
I'm not sure.

1457
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:23,781
Oh,
here it is.

1458
01:20:23,781 --> 01:20:24,614
So I,
I personally think that that was 

1459
01:20:25,971 --> 01:20:27,590
intentional.
How it stopped right there.

1460
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:30,050
It's kind of still beautiful.
It is very beautiful.

1461
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,840
So what it was is,
I mean,

1462
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,510
he wasn't destroying someone's 
purchased.

1463
01:20:34,511 --> 01:20:38,420
He was a,
it was a little bit of a gift.

1464
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:41,450
Everyone freaked out.

1465
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:44,690
Definitely ended up as a gift.
I mean,

1466
01:20:44,691 --> 01:20:48,410
the guy who bought it had the option to 
back out and he was like,

1467
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:49,101
fuck,
no,

1468
01:20:49,101 --> 01:20:50,840
I want that.
Yeah.

1469
01:20:50,990 --> 01:20:53,540
It's kind of like by you.
You remember Mark Mcgrath?

1470
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:54,403
What was that guy's name?
The baseball player that like broke the 

1471
01:20:56,941 --> 01:20:59,840
home run record and mark mcgwire Mark 
Mcguire,

1472
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,390
market country sugar sugar.
Oh yeah,

1473
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:04,021
you're right.
Sugar,

1474
01:21:04,021 --> 01:21:06,470
a sugar ray.
He,

1475
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:11,500
he broke the home run record and uh,
the foul ball hit into the stadium.

1476
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:13,253
The guy who caught it,
Isla sold it for 3 million bucks and 

1477
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:18,600
then extends.
Everyone was on steroids.

1478
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:20,490
They kept breaking the record like every
year.

1479
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:24,210
So it lost all of its value.
But this is that foul ball.

1480
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:28,950
So a closed down one.
Oh,

1481
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:31,020
and that.
Okay.

1482
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:33,300
So here,
here,

1483
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,253
read that

1484
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,040
today.
My art broker.com

1485
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:36,874
received this seller and Korea via 
website from someone who has taken it 

1486
01:21:39,101 --> 01:21:39,934
upon themselves to shred their own grill
with blueprint in order to increase its 

1487
01:21:43,361 --> 01:21:45,330
value.
They have taken a piece of art,

1488
01:21:45,331 --> 01:21:49,120
earthly rough worth the 40,000
pounds and in our opinion,

1489
01:21:49,121 --> 01:21:51,260
made its value one.
Come on.

1490
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:54,820
That's so stupid.
Why would you?

1491
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,810
Uh,
I don't think there's pictures of it.

1492
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:58,683
They,
I don't think they even want to give 

1493
01:21:59,311 --> 01:22:00,510
that guy any attention.

1494
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,960
That's crazy to actually take a genuine 
piece of art,

1495
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,700
valuable art and just be like,
oh,

1496
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:09,540
I'm going to fucking cut it up now.
Like that's not how it works.

1497
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:13,190
The seller wanted them to list it as a 
80,

1498
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:15,530
80,000
pound and they,

1499
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:18,950
this disagreed.
Denied.

1500
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:20,330
Oh my God,

1501
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:25,080
idiot.
I bet you someone buys that though.

1502
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,400
I'll bet I'll bet a dollar on it.
It says worth a dollar.

1503
01:22:29,401 --> 01:22:31,500
I got a dollar.
Let's start the bidding.

1504
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:35,600
I mean,
that piece has history to.

1505
01:22:35,601 --> 01:22:38,150
It was the idiot who cut up.
You know what I'm saying?

1506
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:43,110
I love it.
We've,

1507
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,480
we've spent a lot of money on art.

1508
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:46,063
Yeah.

1509
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:49,080
But um,
maybe like a couple thousand dollars,

1510
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:51,063
which you're basically paying for 
someone's time and appreciation versus 

1511
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:56,760
you know,
$20,000,000

1512
01:22:56,761 --> 01:22:58,540
for a print.
I mean,

1513
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,450
as a big difference.
I,

1514
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:03,550
I appreciate art that I,
that I like and I'll,

1515
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:06,490
I'll spend a thousand bucks,
a couple thousand bucks,

1516
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:11,780
hundred thousand fucking suck.
A lot.

1517
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,900
Depends.
Like this Guy Robert,

1518
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:21,970
a Xavier has this huge Batman.
I love it.

1519
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,020
It's amazing.
I mean that things,

1520
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:26,023
I guess worth 100,000,
but it's like the size of this whole 

1521
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:29,980
back.
Yeah.

1522
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,690
You kind of need.
He spent like 10,000

1523
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:33,670
hours and like a whole house just for 
that.

1524
01:23:33,671 --> 01:23:36,280
But anyway,
like there's some stuff like the gold,

1525
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,320
the diamond skull.
What was that sold for?

1526
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:42,280
Like 100 million,
$400,000,000.

1527
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:47,330
How rich and board can you be?
A hundred million.

1528
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:51,190
You could feed the whole continent of 
Africa.

1529
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:57,610
The non with the skull.
They're like,

1530
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,580
they're like fix homelessness in our 
city forever.

1531
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:05,410
Now I'll take the school,
I'll take the school please.

1532
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:10,210
They're like cure here.
Uh,

1533
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:14,560
HIV and AIDS and all of Africa or one 
diamond skull.

1534
01:24:14,561 --> 01:24:19,561
I'll take the school,
Howard stern had this great bit where he

1535
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:23,080
went on the street that the Boston 
bomber,

1536
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,190
he was this handsome young,
like a Arab kid,

1537
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,083
the Boston bomber,
and there was a lot of girls who are 

1538
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:30,874
like a talking about how cute he was and
so they went on the street with a 

1539
01:24:35,741 --> 01:24:38,740
picture of Howard and a picture of the 
Boston bomber and the like.

1540
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:39,574
Which one would you rather date?
And everyone was picking the Boston 

1541
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:44,710
bomber over at Howard.
I love that.

1542
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:47,650
So funny.
Rather data terrorists than our.

1543
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:51,010
I don't think he was by the way,
just for the record.

1544
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:51,970
Oh God.
What was he?

1545
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:56,620
I think he was a Chechnyan.
I mean he was a Muslim.

1546
01:24:56,621 --> 01:24:57,970
He wasn't an Arab.
Correct.

1547
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:58,900
Okay.
My bad.

1548
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:02,380
I stand corrected.
I want to stand at my pulpit.

1549
01:25:02,381 --> 01:25:03,214
I want to say I am.
I apologize to all of my Arab brothers 

1550
01:25:05,861 --> 01:25:10,030
out there who have been offended in this
unfortunate mischaracterization.

1551
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:12,880
Not all,
not all Arabs are terrorists,

1552
01:25:12,881 --> 01:25:13,714
and that was not what I meant to imply 
by any means of any stretch of 

1553
01:25:16,331 --> 01:25:17,164
imagination.
He was a Muslim young man of Chechnyan 

1554
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:20,890
descent,
which I believe is.

1555
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,233
Where's that Dan?
It's a region in southern Russia and 

1556
01:25:25,301 --> 01:25:27,850
it's sort of an ongoing as it's been.
Great.

1557
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:29,320
Thank you.
Thank you very much,

1558
01:25:29,321 --> 01:25:30,520
Dan,
for the clarification.

1559
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:34,210
And uh,
please forgive me please.

1560
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:39,160
And if you think that you need to write 
an essay about my mistake here today and

1561
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:41,860
expose me,
please you have my permission.

1562
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:46,840
I made a grave error of judgment and I 
give full permission to make a 30 minute

1563
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:51,870
essay about it as is entirely warranted.
So apologies to everyone for that.

1564
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:57,130
And a shout out to,
to the SAS right now,

1565
01:25:58,710 --> 01:26:02,710
a grease bands,
obese tourists from writing on donkeys.

1566
01:26:02,711 --> 01:26:05,840
I love.
It's fucking hilarious.

1567
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,633
Here's our fat lady on a donkey.
Greece has banned fat tourists from 

1568
01:26:11,391 --> 01:26:12,224
riding on donkeys after campaigners.
So the animals were being left with 

1569
01:26:14,421 --> 01:26:17,000
spinal injuries.
Listen,

1570
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,120
this isn't a century named grace.
We've been there.

1571
01:26:21,121 --> 01:26:21,954
It's a tiny little.
I never once had the urge to write a 

1572
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:25,964
dog.
It's not really even like a donkey 

1573
01:26:27,201 --> 01:26:28,480
friendly.
No,

1574
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:32,800
I don't really get that.
Um,

1575
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:33,850
Australia,
if you look,

1576
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:36,010
if you're fat,
you got to give up some,

1577
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:41,110
you've kind of give some things up.
If you're a big fucking fatty and you're

1578
01:26:41,111 --> 01:26:45,570
going to break a donkey's back than 
mean,

1579
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:46,660
you know what I'm saying?

1580
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:47,493
Like there was a Nathan for you about 
the people on horses and he had to put 

1581
01:26:51,601 --> 01:26:55,080
like weather balloons on him and shit.
Look,

1582
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:57,360
don't have.
What's the weight limit?

1583
01:26:57,361 --> 01:26:59,340
How do they,
how do they define fat?

1584
01:26:59,370 --> 01:27:03,000
Because it just says fat.
Let's see how they define it.

1585
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:04,440
The,
this,

1586
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,710
these state,
a donkey giving tours.

1587
01:27:07,711 --> 01:27:11,130
Rides and salary should not carry any 
load is heavier than 100 kilograms.

1588
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:16,800
What does that convert to see sound like
a lot.

1589
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:18,713
Two hundred and 20 pounds.
So unless you're extremely tall and 

1590
01:27:23,581 --> 01:27:27,280
built,
if you're over 2100.

1591
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:28,753
Wait,
what?

1592
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:31,250
Yeah,
that's not a bad.

1593
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:33,980
I too fat.

1594
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:39,440
I'm like at one 95.
That's pretty close.

1595
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,210
Yo.
I'm too fat for a donkey.

1596
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:45,980
What the fuck?
Why do you need to ride a donkey?

1597
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:50,990
A beast of burden is that now I just did
a complete one.

1598
01:27:51,681 --> 01:27:54,980
80 was writing these donkeys.
A little children.

1599
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:58,040
Yeah.
I had a couple of hamburgers in my life,

1600
01:27:58,041 --> 01:28:00,950
but am I too fat to ride a donkey?
I don't think so.

1601
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,940
They're just a little donkeys though.
They're not horses.

1602
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:11,550
They're just trying to save them going 
down the stairs so he can do the stairs.

1603
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:14,170
Do some exercise.
No,

1604
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,123
I need a donkey.
Ride the fucking kill this donkey 

1605
01:28:18,221 --> 01:28:20,200
because I'm so fat.
I'm going to break its back.

1606
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:24,730
Look down more.
You can see the stairs down more.

1607
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:26,920
More.
Oh God.

1608
01:28:26,921 --> 01:28:31,921
You poor people taking the incognito fat
people on donkeys.

1609
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:36,960
They blurted,
but a tiny bit.

1610
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:39,810
You can still see that guy knows who he 
is.

1611
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:45,060
God.
He's not even enjoying himself.

1612
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:46,493
That donkey will never have another 
passenger and you're not even enjoying 

1613
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:49,223
yourself.
That dog is going to be put to sleep 

1614
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,500
after this and you're not even enjoying 
yourself.

1615
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:53,813
Wait,
this says,

1616
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,313
yeah.
One hundred kilograms will gotta cut 

1617
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:57,810
him.
There's more.

1618
01:28:58,830 --> 01:29:02,100
You can go that down yourself.
Oh my God.

1619
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,930
Wait.
We did do a donkey ride.

1620
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:10,290
No,
we didn't in center in it.

1621
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:14,820
Then we'd go up with donkeys on those 
stairs are my fucking tripping balls.

1622
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:20,880
No donkey rides.
Maybe I'm thinking of something else.

1623
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:24,060
How did we get up to the hotel by car?
Like a same.

1624
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:25,500
Yeah,
we had a car.

1625
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:31,040
It's a normal place to take a donkey.
Those poor donkeys,

1626
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,073
man.
God Damn poor motherfuckers fucked up 

1627
01:29:45,771 --> 01:29:47,690
life.
Just falling fat.

1628
01:29:47,691 --> 01:29:52,691
Americans up and down a hill.
I love this store though.

1629
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:53,943
So point.

1630
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:56,143
Hmm.

1631
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:58,670
Incredible stuff,
man.

1632
01:29:58,671 --> 01:30:00,860
Sixty minutes really stepped up.
Their game.

1633
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:02,510
Dog is a mayor.
Oh,

1634
01:30:02,511 --> 01:30:03,344
we've got these fans submissions,
but it's already been two hours or hour 

1635
01:30:05,751 --> 01:30:06,920
and a half short.
Wrap it up.

1636
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:11,270
We could save it for next time.
This one's too funny.

1637
01:30:11,271 --> 01:30:13,030
I'm going to do this one on my hand at 
guys.

1638
01:30:13,031 --> 01:30:14,720
Send your questions.
Comments,

1639
01:30:14,721 --> 01:30:16,520
uh,
essays,

1640
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:20,930
video suggestions to podcasts at 
[inaudible] productions.com.

1641
01:30:20,931 --> 01:30:23,750
I love it.
Um,

1642
01:30:24,110 --> 01:30:28,130
this one was so funny from Joey Lewis.
He says,

1643
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:29,350
Hey Ethan.
Isla,

1644
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,193
I listened to you're at number 87 
podcasts where you mentioned how semen 

1645
01:30:32,241 --> 01:30:33,074
can clog up the drain.
This was relevant to me because the 

1646
01:30:35,511 --> 01:30:38,030
freshmen housing at my school,
thank God I don't live there.

1647
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:40,520
Ken,
Ken's Shaw State,

1648
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:43,490
they had to remove and replace the 
plumbing for one of the buildings,

1649
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,710
the whole entire building due to the 
buildup of semen tangling with air.

1650
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,013
There is a photo of the notice that the 
university housing put up to reminds 

1651
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:53,570
just not to jerk off in the shower.

1652
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,950
When you said there is a photo.
I almost.

1653
01:30:58,190 --> 01:30:58,690
Yeah,
yeah,

1654
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:00,270
yeah.
I know.

1655
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:04,040
I have the same fear.
If you're not jerking off in the shower,

1656
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:07,100
where are you jerking off,
but it's a communal shower.

1657
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:10,910
You've got to jerk off responsibly.
Patrice O'neil had the Chris joke.

1658
01:31:10,911 --> 01:31:11,744
Every says,
I jerked off in the shower so many 

1659
01:31:12,891 --> 01:31:13,724
times.
I'm surprised a little baby hasn't 

1660
01:31:14,691 --> 01:31:19,691
crawled out your residence.
We have recently found several blockages

1661
01:31:21,321 --> 01:31:24,860
in plumbing system in university village
sweets mostly caused by human hair.

1662
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:28,580
Let me set my water.
However,

1663
01:31:28,581 --> 01:31:30,950
over the last month,
we have found many of these blockages to

1664
01:31:30,951 --> 01:31:34,820
be caused by large quantities of what we
have now determined to be semen.

1665
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:40,280
This is intolerable because semen is not
soluble in water.

1666
01:31:40,281 --> 01:31:44,120
It gets caught and filters and our sis 
system and particularly susceptible.

1667
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:48,080
This issue has cost the university 
thousands of dollars to repair this far.

1668
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:49,413
Thank God,
good thing you collect a lot of tuition 

1669
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:52,970
since stopped complaining.
It's warm out my semen,

1670
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:58,430
though we know that though we know that 
you must take care of your business.

1671
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:02,350
We have never faced a situation of this 
enormity before.

1672
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,230
It is because of this.
Unfortunately,

1673
01:32:05,231 --> 01:32:07,870
that we must ask you to refrain from 
masturbating in the shower.

1674
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:09,693
May we those who wished to masturbate,
do so in the comfort of their own 

1675
01:32:12,431 --> 01:32:15,280
bedroom and dispose of their discharge 
appropriately.

1676
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:18,820
I bet you 90 percent of the dudes 
continue to jack off in the shop.

1677
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,393
I knew,
and yet unlike [inaudible] no signature 

1678
01:32:25,301 --> 01:32:26,560
though,
this guy should frame it.

1679
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:27,813
No signature,

1680
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:30,483
Joey.

1681
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:34,140
That's the tough thing how you can't 
guarantee that.

1682
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:35,813
It's like you gotta stop me.
I'm jerking off in the shower that God 

1683
01:32:38,881 --> 01:32:42,510
intended.
That's why school is so expensive,

1684
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:45,720
so the fucking demon.
That's fine.

1685
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:51,990
I had a communal shower and college boy.
It was cold sexual boys and girls shared

1686
01:32:53,011 --> 01:32:53,821
the same bathroom.
Yeah,

1687
01:32:53,821 --> 01:32:58,821
I know it was progressive Santa Cruz,
but there was all the.

1688
01:32:59,161 --> 01:33:02,720
So you would come out with a towel?
Yeah,

1689
01:33:02,721 --> 01:33:03,210
yeah,
yeah.

1690
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:05,900
There wasn't naked people.
Yeah.

1691
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:08,930
Yeah.
But like there's like four showers,

1692
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:13,710
stalls next to each other with like a 
curtain and private stall.

1693
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,600
But yeah,
it was a cold wet,

1694
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:17,910
but there was,
you could.

1695
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:20,880
There was semen on the floor sometimes 
guys.

1696
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:24,510
Yeah.
There was a bathtub in there by the way.

1697
01:33:24,511 --> 01:33:25,344
Then nobody,
you.

1698
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:30,210
But God forbid you were in the military.
Wasn't a coed there.

1699
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:31,350
Are you fucking kidding?

1700
01:33:31,490 --> 01:33:32,323
Co?
Everything I know about the military is 

1701
01:33:34,981 --> 01:33:38,490
from starship troopers,
so I don't know it.

1702
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:39,783
It's the females.
We had our own like little area and the 

1703
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:47,124
mail having their own area.
Even the Western Wall is separated and 

1704
01:33:49,471 --> 01:33:53,760
they're fucking fully clothed that the 
US military is and coed.

1705
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:58,550
Like I said,
starship troopers are eight.

1706
01:33:58,610 --> 01:33:59,443
Dan,
I'll never forget that scene and I saw 

1707
01:34:01,681 --> 01:34:06,681
some titties that I didn't expect that I
still have a shower and I was like,

1708
01:34:06,721 --> 01:34:09,120
what the fuck?
Because I ended up,

1709
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:11,760
I was like 13,
so if somebody like looked at me,

1710
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:13,343
pop a boner and it's like,
how do they shower with her and they 

1711
01:34:16,811 --> 01:34:17,644
don't all have fat boners right now.
Remember when you're 13 and like you 

1712
01:34:27,561 --> 01:34:29,240
tend,
you hit a speed bump on the bus a little

1713
01:34:29,241 --> 01:34:30,350
too fast.
You pop a boner,

1714
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:35,770
tuck it under the belt,
you get really good at the uh,

1715
01:34:35,771 --> 01:34:36,800
the Bass,
uh,

1716
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,450
the backpack masking method.
Yeah.

1717
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:40,533
Was checking something in your backpack?
I tucked it under the belt most of the 

1718
01:34:45,071 --> 01:34:45,904
time,
but sometimes because you have to kind 

1719
01:34:48,871 --> 01:34:50,620
of maneuver for that.
And Yeah,

1720
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:51,673
a lot of tucking and grabbing.
So the backpack is definitely a god 

1721
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:55,803
send.

1722
01:35:00,910 --> 01:35:03,490
It's one of the two options.
I don't think there's anything else.

1723
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:04,473
Is there anything else in or Zach,
is there another way that you guys 

1724
01:35:06,131 --> 01:35:11,131
concealed boners rarely ever get them at
school,

1725
01:35:12,001 --> 01:35:16,590
but as soon as I got home and was like 
sitting on the toilet when I was 13,

1726
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:19,310
that was it.
What,

1727
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,473
what?
You pop a bony on the toilet because 

1728
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:26,310
it's like your space,
like do your business jerk off.

1729
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:27,330
Yeah.
This is what I'm saying.

1730
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:30,723
You didn't read the question.
Where else have you mentioned to me 

1731
01:35:35,191 --> 01:35:40,191
that.
So you would shit and jerk off?

1732
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,260
Uh,
yes sir.

1733
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:43,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

1734
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:46,563
Interesting.

1735
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,810
Would you check off after you shit?
Uh,

1736
01:35:50,811 --> 01:35:53,150
yeah.
Well it really depends how big the shape

1737
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,520
is.
Shit,

1738
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,180
while jerking off.
Always separate.

1739
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:00,040
I don't know if that's possible,
but you know,

1740
01:36:00,041 --> 01:36:05,041
like it was either one before the other.
So you sit there still do flush the bulb

1741
01:36:06,151 --> 01:36:07,780
before he check off.
Like you said over the shit.

1742
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:17,710
I can't jerk off on this shit and the 
flush and then you've still stinks.

1743
01:36:18,071 --> 01:36:23,071
Probably though have like a smell.
I smell my own farts.

1744
01:36:27,581 --> 01:36:29,320
I'm a minute.
I love it.

1745
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:32,280
I love it.
Love it.

1746
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:34,100
Love it.
Yeah.

1747
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:36,460
You wouldn't admit it.
You don't like to smell your own parts?

1748
01:36:36,970 --> 01:36:38,410
Not even a little bit.
You're not intrigued.

1749
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:40,120
No.
You're not intrigued.

1750
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:43,030
Not intrigued.
At least interested.

1751
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:44,980
Interested in what?
The smell.

1752
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:47,800
No,
fucking liar.

1753
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:52,620
That's like a biological fact that 
people liked the smell,

1754
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,450
their own fars like,
like they enjoy.

1755
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:58,070
I think so you'd think Dan,
do you like the smell it?

1756
01:36:58,340 --> 01:36:59,173
I'm sorry.
I can't.

1757
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:04,453
Sorry,
you started by saying it's a fact and 

1758
01:37:05,661 --> 01:37:07,300
then you finished with.
I think so.

1759
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:10,510
I was.
I think this is another debate.

1760
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:15,100
I think people like the smell,
but I will.

1761
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:18,910
I will give you that.
Kind of tolerate it for sure.

1762
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:21,810
For sure.
I her,

1763
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:28,200
I swear to God.
You smell it and enjoy it.

1764
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:30,191
You,
Dave,

1765
01:37:30,191 --> 01:37:33,140
you breathe deeply on it.
You're just doing a movie.

1766
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:35,240
I am not.
I liked the small amount of parks.

1767
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,200
There's a lot of people out there that 
said,

1768
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,073
I agree.
So this is another one of these things 

1769
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:42,400
mean to explore.
I'm being genuine by the way.

1770
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,330
I'm serious.
Why would I admit to that?

1771
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:51,880
But like why would I lie about liking 
the spelman being controversial?

1772
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:55,230
I'm not eva wants desperately,
not the believer.

1773
01:37:55,231 --> 01:37:56,190
This is what I'm hearing.

1774
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:00,330
Um,
there was another one somebody asked,

1775
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:01,893
um,
and the spirit of all these 

1776
01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:09,711
conversations id zed,
zed zed slur asked,

1777
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,190
I was always convinced everyone picks 
their nose picking her nose,

1778
01:38:14,191 --> 01:38:15,024
ventilates it effectively and enables 
you to breathe much easier for the more 

1779
01:38:17,971 --> 01:38:18,804
scraping,
a nice dry chunk of snot out of your 

1780
01:38:20,011 --> 01:38:20,844
nose is the best feeling ever.
To me it seems like a basic human 

1781
01:38:23,371 --> 01:38:26,160
necessity.
But maybe those are just my own habits.

1782
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:29,850
Ever since you started these types of 
conversation on your podcast,

1783
01:38:29,851 --> 01:38:33,960
I started doubting my judgment on what's
normal and what is not more and more.

1784
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:35,100
So.
Do you pick your nose?

1785
01:38:35,101 --> 01:38:37,800
If so,
which finger do use also?

1786
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,960
I'm pretty sure there are people who 
even eat their burger.

1787
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:45,060
I'm not sure whether it is only kids or 
adults to personally.

1788
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:47,910
I always found it gross so I never did.
Do you?

1789
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:50,760
So,
um,

1790
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:52,343
we're discussing taboo.
We're breaking apart tonight on 60 

1791
01:38:55,861 --> 01:38:56,694
minutes.

1792
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,090
I think everyone picks their nose,
but there's certain levels to it.

1793
01:39:03,091 --> 01:39:05,760
Like if I'm in the shower,
like I find it gross.

1794
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:08,820
So if I'm in the shower,
that's a good place to pick my nose,

1795
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:12,150
but generally I'll try to use a tissue 
or something just because I don't.

1796
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:15,540
I just think it's kind of gross 
personally.

1797
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:16,374
But I think everyone picks their nose.
I tell you what's grocer that I've seen 

1798
01:39:21,031 --> 01:39:21,864
people do.
I guess you're just walking with 

1799
01:39:23,011 --> 01:39:26,260
somebody on the street and just out a 
nowhere without saying anything.

1800
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:31,910
Oh my fucking.
The worst is the worst.

1801
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,130
You're just having a conversation and 
make conversation.

1802
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:37,400
Should Sean Balog does that?

1803
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:41,900
I'm like,
what the fuck are you calling?

1804
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:43,880
Whatever.
He doesn't care.

1805
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:47,473
And then they won't come out.
So they'll go on the street with 

1806
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:54,084
shredder the other day and someone just 
walking across the street from me and 

1807
01:39:57,201 --> 01:39:58,034
they go,
why would you do that in sight of 

1808
01:40:02,031 --> 01:40:05,810
another human being a lunatic.
Some people think that's normal.

1809
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:12,040
That's fucking wild.
Shit.

1810
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,600
Shit's crazy.
So picking the nose,

1811
01:40:20,601 --> 01:40:21,710
I think.
I agree.

1812
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:26,270
Eating boogers is fucked up.
If you're under the age of eight,

1813
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,630
you need to plug in.
Can Weirdo over.

1814
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:29,740
But yeah,
actually,

1815
01:40:29,741 --> 01:40:30,850
you know what?
I shouldn't say I don't want to.

1816
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,170
I never did it as my personal 
preference.

1817
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:39,070
I seen some friends where I look over 
and they're like trying to like low key.

1818
01:40:39,071 --> 01:40:43,960
They're bugs when I was.
Now I know people do that.

1819
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:46,350
I don't want to shame booger eaters 
because we're.

1820
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:49,600
We're getting out there,
we're putting it all out there.

1821
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:50,493
So I think I do think there's a large 
percentage of adults eat their burgers 

1822
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,280
and secret.
The idea to me is frankly repulsive.

1823
01:40:58,780 --> 01:40:59,613
Why?
I don't think Zachary fee and then 

1824
01:41:04,121 --> 01:41:06,010
anything is possible.
People like it.

1825
01:41:06,011 --> 01:41:07,780
I don't know.
It's like smelling your own far to me.

1826
01:41:07,781 --> 01:41:08,614
That makes sense.
But eating a burger makes me want to 

1827
01:41:09,641 --> 01:41:11,100
fucking die.
He enter.

1828
01:41:11,101 --> 01:41:12,610
Zach,
I have to ask for posterity.

1829
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:14,530
Do any of you guys pick your nose or eat
your books?

1830
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:18,670
I would rather lick dog poop.
Then wonder what about your own Burger?

1831
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:22,210
Absolutely not disgusting.
No,

1832
01:41:22,211 --> 01:41:23,044
never year and it's his own books only 
gets the skepticism came into dry too 

1833
01:41:30,881 --> 01:41:33,490
fast.
So anyway,

1834
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:38,520
that was interesting conversation.
I'm just.

1835
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:43,750
That's about it.
I know about dog becomes mares.

1836
01:41:43,751 --> 01:41:46,630
That's something interesting or no dog 
became a mayor.

1837
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:48,011
That's it.
There you go.

1838
01:41:48,011 --> 01:41:50,050
That's just what,
you know,

1839
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:50,913
there's this whole story about a dog is 
getting reelected as mayor and what it 

1840
01:41:54,221 --> 01:41:56,770
made me think about is what does this 
say about the job,

1841
01:41:56,771 --> 01:41:59,380
mayor?
I stopped the bullying the video.

1842
01:41:59,381 --> 01:42:01,970
Say like you did good.
Like what does that mean?

1843
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:04,600
He's a good boy.
Being the mayors of serious job.

1844
01:42:04,601 --> 01:42:06,580
Like you get paid like you have 
responsibilities.

1845
01:42:06,581 --> 01:42:08,900
Like what does this say about all 
government job?

1846
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:14,820
I think it was the mayor of La is a 
serious job.

1847
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:16,031
Yeah.
Yeah.

1848
01:42:16,031 --> 01:42:17,290
But uh,
I think in,

1849
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:20,200
in smaller towns,
the mayor is like a ceremonial thing,

1850
01:42:20,230 --> 01:42:23,470
like the city council really run shit.
And then the mayor,

1851
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:25,210
I know this completely from parks and 
rec.

1852
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:30,270
So take this all with everything I know 
is based off your shows and the movies,

1853
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:34,180
all the knowledge question.
Um,

1854
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:36,963
and they're,
you know what they're said it cost a 

1855
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,520
dollar to vote for the mayor.

1856
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:40,541
I was like,
well,

1857
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:41,620
let's wait.
Really?

1858
01:42:41,621 --> 01:42:44,440
No.
Or to run human know about dollar volt.

1859
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:46,660
Probably not that serious of an 
election.

1860
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:51,070
Then it costs to vote.
That's what I recall from the video.

1861
01:42:51,071 --> 01:42:53,890
We're not going to watch.
All right.

1862
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:58,450
That's enough of this.
Thank you everyone who watched.

1863
01:42:58,690 --> 01:43:01,570
Thank you everyone who listened.
Thank you everyone who enjoyed.

1864
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:03,090
I hope you're having a blessed at 
Friday.

1865
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:06,430
Hope you have a blessed weekend.
Thank you to everyone who's taking notes

1866
01:43:06,431 --> 01:43:07,264
diligently right now to cast their essay
on a Swedish reproductions and how I've 

1867
01:43:12,491 --> 01:43:15,250
changed,
which is true.

1868
01:43:15,251 --> 01:43:16,084
I have changed.
And so there's definitely something 

1869
01:43:17,621 --> 01:43:18,454
there.
How I've compromised my morals for 

1870
01:43:21,101 --> 01:43:22,330
money.
That's a popular one.

1871
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:26,150
There's evidence there you can pull from
and um,

1872
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,180
yeah,
there's a lot there.

1873
01:43:28,181 --> 01:43:32,140
So I wish you all the best with your 
essay and we all look forward to walk.

1874
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,260
So guys,
thank you all.

1875
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:40,060
And of course using this clip and be 
using this club and be like,

1876
01:43:40,061 --> 01:43:40,894
look how he doesn't take criticism.
Look how he makes fun of the fact that 

1877
01:43:44,681 --> 01:43:48,250
he's just a shill.
I look forward to that as well and I,

1878
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:50,860
and I think if we're taking everything 
into consideration,

1879
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:56,180
my dear friends have a blessing.
Bless and weekend.

1880
01:43:56,181 --> 01:43:59,660
Thank you all so much and thank you all 
for enjoying our new video.

1881
01:43:59,661 --> 01:44:01,640
That meant a lot.
It was very nice to see.

1882
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:02,930
Yeah,
felt good.

1883
01:44:02,931 --> 01:44:06,930
It was a very wholesome experience day.
Very happy thoughts and,

1884
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:12,050
and I'll see you hopefully a lot of you 
tomorrow at Ripon dip at our little meet

1885
01:44:12,051 --> 01:44:12,884
and greet.
I'm looking forward to all of that and 

1886
01:44:18,411 --> 01:44:20,720
so much more.
He was pregnant.

1887
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:24,890
We had a whole thing about.
We had a whole thing about food.

1888
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:28,610
You can eat deli meats.

1889
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:31,220
You've got nine months to talk about it.
You can't eat deli meats.

1890
01:44:31,221 --> 01:44:32,054
I was like,
if isla can eat deli meats when she was 

1891
01:44:33,021 --> 01:44:35,570
pregnant,
we all should not be eating delegates.

1892
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:38,150
That's freaky.
You know what I'm saying?

1893
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:43,460
But that's not how it works.
It's not just.

1894
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:46,430
It's sensitive to the.
To the little.

1895
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:49,820
The little people have a baby that it is
right now.

1896
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:52,050
Boucher songs almost over.
Oh,

1897
01:44:52,530 --> 01:44:54,230
we better go.
All right guys,

1898
01:44:54,231 --> 01:44:56,240
thank you all for watching.
Have a blessed weekend.

1899
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:57,143
Love you,
appreciate you and we'll see you next 

1900
01:44:58,101 --> 01:44:59,360
time.
Thank you so much.
