1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,840
Welcome everybody.
We are back the h three podcast,

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,980
episode 100.
I got to tell you,

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,820
I wasn't sure we'd make it to 100.
We had a bumpy road.

4
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:20,380
We had some ups,
we had some downs.

5
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:21,850
We have some goose,
we have some laughs,

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,743
we had some booths,
but here we are for better or worse 

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,640
episode for better 100.
Here we are.

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,530
We soldiered on.
First of all,

9
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:37,480
thank you to our sponsors,
stamps.com.

10
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:38,314
Me undies 23.
Me Twenty three and me and dollar shave 

11
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:41,854
club now.
Today is also very coincidentally the 

12
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:48,670
last episode of the year which happens 
so perfectly.

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,683
I was going to lie and say it was 
episode 100 today just so we could hit 

14
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:54,880
that milestone,
but I didn't need the lie.

15
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,330
It was episode 100.
He actually was that.

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,353
I was in the car.
It's just going to skip 99 so we're 

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,040
going to skip that and just be like,
I don't know.

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,640
You guys are talking about but magically
it's episode 100.

19
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,670
We have so much a look back on.
So today what we're going to do,

20
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:15,970
and I think is going to be a lot of fun,
is I'm going to bring in and Dan out,

21
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:16,804
we're going to all sit here and share 
our favorite and our worst moments of 

22
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:27,970
the first 100 episodes because think 
back to our first episode was Pewdie Pie

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,880
sitting in his rental house in La and 
you,

24
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,773
you look,
well we weren't live streaming for like 

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,570
the first 10 or 15 episodes.
It was like eight.

26
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,793
And we had like a really weird desk here
that one and the guests would sit on 

27
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:47,050
this purple couch.
It was very strange,

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,573
but the big breakthrough I think came 
for us when we started live streaming 

29
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,990
it.
And when we got this table Ed,

30
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,500
we started to feel the format more.

31
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,230
And obviously I'm still developing a 
lot.

32
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,110
Um,
God,

33
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,200
please,
please God let there be room to grow.

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,583
We haven't.
You always said that the rule is the 

35
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:08,524
first hundred or you don't know what 
you're doing until the first hundred 

36
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:10,990
episodes.
That's what,

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,460
that's what I say.
And,

38
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,500
and kind of a master now,
please God,

39
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,750
let that be true.
No,

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,550
there's,
there's been so much to learn.

41
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,990
Someone said that you don't know until 
the 2:50

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,770
episodes.
Yeah,

43
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,210
we gotta we gotta push that back because
now that we're at $100,

44
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:29,044
the pressure's on.
I heard Joe Rogan say you don't know 

45
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:32,494
until a thousand,
so I think we still have a lot of room 

46
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:38,010
to go.
Um,

47
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,383
so we're going to bring everyone out.
We've got a ton of great things to look 

48
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:43,301
back on it.
I mean,

49
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:44,134
we've been doing this for two years.
It took us two years to get to 100 

50
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:46,990
episodes.

51
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,830
There's a lot of great moments that I 
forgot even happened that we're going to

52
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:52,540
look over.
Um,

53
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,003
so I can't wait.
I'm super excited and just everyone 

54
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:59,140
who's tuned in and stuck around for this
wild.

55
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,500
I thank you so much.
It's been an incredible journey here and

56
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,070
I'm looking forward to getting to that.
But before we do,

57
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,550
we had our huge charity stream on 
Tuesday,

58
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,930
which we streamed for eight and a half 
hours the longest day of my life.

59
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,230
Still recovering from that.
That was absolutely brutal.

60
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:25,060
And against all odds we hit $100,000
live.

61
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:26,200
Hell yeah.
Couldn't believe it.

62
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,930
I had to live because I was sick.
I'm still kind of sick.

63
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,333
But um,
I got home and I think you just raised 

64
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,070
to 75 and I him,
that's it.

65
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:38,860
You guys were going to leave.
But Justin was like,

66
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:40,840
no way.
I'm not 100.

67
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,050
And then it happened pretty fast.
Like I couldn't believe it.

68
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,650
Um,
why is it not letting me sign into my,

69
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,460
you need permission from Ethan?
I'm,

70
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,413
I am Ethan sign into while letting me 
log into this stats at any word with 

71
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,500
this email and I'll get you.
So at any rate we uh,

72
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,810
well yeah,
because I could tell first of all,

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,810
Zach,
our sound guy had a finals the next day.

74
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,640
Everyone was,
they got here before us.

75
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,030
I was like,
they were,

76
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,390
they were here for like 15 hours that 
day.

77
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,900
And so everyone was getting tired and I 
was like,

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,860
all right,
we can't,

79
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,850
you know.
But,

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,960
but justin pushed us on and it was so 
good that he did.

81
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,513
Yeah,
we hit it.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,661
Okay,
here we go.

83
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,494
I got access,
so let's say I want to go over some 

84
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:28,861
stats.
I'm,

85
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:29,694
I'm very,
I'm always fascinated by what reward 

86
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:37,411
item raised the most money because it's 
always unexpected and by the way,

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,940
this is still up for another 10 days so 
you can still bid,

88
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,193
you can still donate and help out a 
great cause like in the description in 

89
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,383
the description.

90
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,433
So top donors,
I got say we inched out Alex for 100 

91
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,500
bucks because they,
you ula donating from home,

92
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,334
you donated 400 from home and we got 
there now there are so many super 

93
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:08,350
generous people here.
I'm going to out Justin.

94
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,450
That was justin.
That was very generous of him.

95
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,100
Alex was very generous.
James Wayne Hoff donated a 2000.

96
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:18,460
100 will cheer up.
Donated 2000.

97
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:21,850
I mean so many more.
Sookay the channel.

98
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,763
Yeah,
we had him.

99
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,720
He was chilling on the background.
Yeah.

100
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,150
And then we're going to take a call 
who's calling in later today?

101
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,460
A fifths.
Just a few more down on that list.

102
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,720
God bless him.
So button at a time on Tuesday,

103
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:36,610
but we'll,
we'll speak to him later in the episode.

104
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:37,444
Here's the real interesting stuff.
So of all the rewards here is what 

105
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,330
raised the most money and again you can 
bid on all this stuff.

106
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,040
Okay.
Get the heck out of here.

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,460
This pivot table.
So most of all was nothing.

108
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,090
These generous and efforts,
everything like I was $26,000

109
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,320
from the kindness of my heart.
Yeah.

110
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,303
Pretty amazing.
And then Alex crushed what that limited 

111
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:03,440
edition a.
The Journal,

112
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:06,320
the Journal raise $12,000.
So this,

113
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,410
I love the Nintendo switch coming in a 
$300 investment.

114
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,540
We bought one of every gaming system,
a switch,

115
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,980
a ps four,
an xbox and together combined.

116
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:21,160
And that was a last minute idea over 
years,

117
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:22,650
right?
Uh,

118
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,910
yeah that was good one.
So that 1200 bucks raised $20,000.

119
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,980
That was the best fricking return.
Authentic whenever.

120
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,890
But the switch raise 9,000.
That's so cool.

121
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,500
Post Guitar,
I'm happy to see raised $8,300,

122
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,190
right?
Something on Ethan's food book.

123
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,200
God bless rick and morty script lots of 
original art hugging it out.

124
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,160
Oh,
I think I put a thousand on that one.

125
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,030
God,
I hope I get it.

126
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,830
People are gonna.
Think it's a rigged.

127
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,620
If I get it though,
what do we do about that?

128
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,850
It's random,
but then there's so many,

129
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,773
but the really guys,
I want to encourage everybody to keep 

130
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:01,070
donating because if you go down to the 
bottom,

131
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,390
a lot of the original art that we drew 
towards the end,

132
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,463
they didn't get that many donations.

you have a 50 percent chance.

[inaudible] that.

159
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,590
Oh,

160
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,150

50 value.

161
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,143

162
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:32,120
your money.
So there you have it.

163
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,720
There's a lot of amazing prizes and I 
think everyone that was a.

164
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,240
That was an amazing ride.
One it.

165
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,380
What are we at now,
Dan?

166
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:40,070
Like 130,000
or something?

167
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,760
Yeah,
I think we've just broke that uh,

168
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,390
right before going live.
Cool.

169
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,880
Continues to climb.
Good.

170
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,893
And also it's such a tough time for 
people with the Christmas holiday 

171
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:56,231
gifting and so people are really 
generous and that sounds very generous

172
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,293
and I want to say because I'm afraid I 
didn't emphasize it enough during 

173
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,450
because it was focused on getting the 
call,

174
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,620
I was like,
please let me go home.

175
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,020
No,
every dollar matters.

176
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:07,854
And to everyone,
everyone who even dropped $1 to help is 

177
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,420
just,
it makes a big difference.

178
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,270
It's super generous and it's very much 
appreciate it.

179
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:17,910
It's a beautiful thing and it's tax 
deductible.

180
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,520
I don't know how much a $1 tax deduction
will get you,

181
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:22,290
but you know,
hey,

182
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,760
mark it off.
Like you said,

183
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:25,140
every bit counts.
You know,

184
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,713
Benjamin Button said a penny.
A dollar deducted is a dollar earned a 

185
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,263
button.
Yeah,

186
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,133
Benjamin Franklin,
I believe it was the one that did a 

187
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:40,750
little remix.
Alright,

188
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,603
well enough of that shit.
Let's get on to our favorite moments of 

189
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,760
2018.
So I would like to welcome,

190
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,213
I'm the other half of the show with whom
it would not be possible and who I want 

191
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:54,534
to say Dan and Ian come in here.
I'd like to say have truly been a 

192
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,374
blessing to the show.
I want to say that their presence has 

193
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:10,200
made such a difference and add is so 
much presence.

194
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,740
Ian Bring so much character to the show 
with his powerpoint.

195
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,030
Do we have a powerpoint today?

196
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,450
Fire?
No.

197
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,150
Ian and Dan,
please join us.

198
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:26,984
We couldn't do.
We couldn't do a year end recap without 

199
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:31,480
these two guys.
Um,

200
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,740
so what's going on?
But yeah,

201
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,603
what happened when that Kanya decoding?
We were so slammed this week and with 

202
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,733
the teddy fresh stuff too,
it was like I didn't have enough time 

203
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,100
and has been doing all of our customer 
support emails.

204
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,630
By the way,
if you ever complained,

205
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,350
you're talking to not talking to a 
robot.

206
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,240
Nope.
That's it.

207
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,223
That's literally a slab.
That celebrity is answering your 

208
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:57,150
question.
Yep.

209
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,590
So if you hit me with a,
you know,

210
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,150
fuck you.
That's right here.

211
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,570
It feels waco.
You got the first fuck you on supply.

212
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:05,180
You did.
I'll tell me about that.

213
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:06,060
Go on.
I didn't hear about.

214
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,043
Oh yeah,
you were out here and tell me 

215
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,180
everything.
Well,

216
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,930
yeah,
I mean people go,

217
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,270
you know,
it's holidays,

218
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,570
heated,
very time sensitive.

219
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,404
How did you take it?
Did you take a person who could 

220
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:18,241
instruct?
Well,

221
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:20,910
I exploded on him.
Flipped out.

222
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,290
No.
Listen Buddy,

223
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,260
you know,
it happened.

224
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,420
Well,
there's been a lot of delays and uh,

225
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,590
unfortunately there's a lot of packages 
getting delayed.

226
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,130
Well just remember it's Ian's fault so 
you this female,

227
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,410
but the truth is we're trying to get you
out of the trenches there because you're

228
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,800
a creative,
you're brilliant guy and I need that.

229
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,683
A big beautiful brain Ahmedi brain of 
yours working in my benefit by decoding 

230
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:50,400
stuff.
I need to,

231
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:53,880
I need to squeeze that valuable Jews 
that it is worth.

232
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,460
And Dan has been with us longer than 
anyone.

233
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,690
Yeah,
I guess so.

234
00:11:58,691 --> 00:11:59,960
Yeah.
Um,

235
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,250
it's crazy how times past,
but here we are.

236
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,680
Um,
and we'll,

237
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:08,350
let's talk about our favorite moments 
now.

238
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,630
How should we do this?
I've got a bunch of mine.

239
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,300
Maybe I'll go.
Do you think they should present first?

240
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:16,580
Because I have a shit ton.
You guys have less than me now.

241
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,670
Well you have like the general stuff 
stuff that came from fans.

242
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,830
Yeah,
I've got,

243
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,390
I've got it all.
Let's do those first.

244
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,070
So this is everything from the first 100
episodes now.

245
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,190
Joey Salads from the last charity 
stream.

246
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:34,930
This will always go down as one of my 
favorite moments and as history.

247
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,170
Now the backstory of this is that,
um,

248
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,050
because at the time we weren't really 
equipped to live stream,

249
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,560
so joey salads live streamed it from his
phone on his personal twitch gentle that

250
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,050
went across the street from the office 
and we,

251
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:53,723
yeah,
we watched it with a delay but we had 

252
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,253
them on the phone so we were hearing the
audio through the phone and then 

253
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:04,201
watching his stream which made it better
because we heard the screaming about 15,

254
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,160
20 seconds before the impact.

255
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,790
And I love how just so casually and 
calmly,

256
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:13,660
Justin has accepted the bird pepper 
spraying jelly south.

257
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,660
He loves it.
He had no hesitation,

258
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,680
just seemed there.
This was the legendary moment.

259
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,603
And um,
and funnily Joey Salads was banned from 

260
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,090
twitter for doing a dangerous act.
But,

261
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,030
but art fine.
Oh,

262
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:33,820
poor guy.
I think he was three a reinstated.

263
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,173
Sorry,
joy.

264
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,630
Without further ado,

265
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,290
who was recording?
What was it like being there?

266
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:01,770
Seeing that this was like,
I've only been here a couple of weeks at

267
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:02,604
the time and I remember I called my mom 
after I was like a guy just got pepper 

268
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,030
spray work.
You afraid that it will reach,

269
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:13,320
you know,
you didn't feel it.

270
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,154
I kept the distance.
And so to this day Joe says that was 

271
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,040
infinitely worse than a spicy pepper 
trying to help you guys.

272
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:38,040
Kept it real professional.
Ian's following the action camera work.

273
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,950
It's Kinda like when you're filming like
a wildlife shot and like a,

274
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,710
like a gator is attacking a deer and you
can intervene and save the day.

275
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,810
No,
just watch the pain nature play on

276
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,330
Star Trek.
The rules of a non intervention.

277
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,860
It's the first protocol,
the first prime directive.

278
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,760
There you go.
Ian had a prime directive and you wonder

279
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:05,594
how could we top it next year,
but we're going to have to throw them 

280
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:11,000
off a building.
We kinda,

281
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,780
yeah,
that's sort of an issue because um,

282
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:14,763
we,
we went for broke on that first one and 

283
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:20,990
then because joey got a got banned as a 
result,

284
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,600
were a little reluctant to go that far 
again?

285
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,190
Well,
I didn't know what happened,

286
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,020
but I wanted to shoot him with a 
nonlethal been back,

287
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,710
but I was like,
that's not,

288
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,210
that's not gonna fly.
So we have to.

289
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,590
The thing about the spicy peppers that 
even though it's very painful,

290
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,483
it's not necessarily dangerous.
So Youtube doesn't see it as like a 

291
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,210
bantible fence.
So if we can get a professional stuntman

292
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,044
and like a safety crew,
we may be able to throw them off a 

293
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:47,504
building.
Maybe next time we can get some 

294
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:52,094
submissions because I get some ideas.
We have a year lot of people listening 

295
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,013
and next up buggy.
Now buggy is such an incredible guests 

296
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:04,721
because he always,
he doesn't hold back and he has a,

297
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,360
he had a story on his last visit about 
dating a feeder.

298
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,540
Just such a pleasure.
Such a pleasure.

299
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,240
And so here we go.
She,

300
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:14,910
oh she like,

301
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,743
come in and I'm so sorry to say this,
this is great cookies and she's laid 

302
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:25,740
them across your chest,
down her stomach to make an arrow to her

303
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:26,574
vagina.
And then she had filled her Vagina 

304
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,970
Maraschino cherries for dessert.
Swear to God.

305
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,910
And my first thought is,
you are going to get a yeast infection.

306
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,020
What the fuck are you doing?
Like don't put food in your vagina.

307
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,020
How many of you stuffed in there?
Six or seven.

308
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,863
I was like,
you know what I was experiencing in my 

309
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,110
life.
I was like,

310
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,960
this is awesome.
And then do what you gotta do it.

311
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,430
Yeah,
no,

312
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,660
this was news to me out.
Yes,

313
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,543
quite,
quite,

314
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,840
quite literally.
And,

315
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:58,674
and,
uh,

316
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,930
and then we've been together for awhile 
and then I got sick.

317
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,900
I got like an infection in my leg,
which is like real frequent.

318
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,360
I get in with the Olympic team all the 
time and I'm like,

319
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,470
I gotta go to the hospital.
She was like,

320
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,690
they're going to make you lose weight.
And I'm like,

321
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:12,961
no,
no,

322
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:13,830
no,
that's going to be fine.

323
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:17,660
I go into the store to go to the 
hospital and I'm like,

324
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,860
mom,
what are really.

325
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,260
Fuck you.
Okay.

326
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:23,020
We're done.
Like,

327
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,490
I'm not going to die.
She's faking the infection.

328
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,670
How do you fake an infection?
What do you pitch was twisted?

329
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,581
I mean,
well,

330
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:37,371
what's,
you know,

331
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:40,060
what ultimately is the goal of feeding 
someone the,

332
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,760
that that leads to death.
That's the one path.

333
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,283
But uh,
what was it mentioned in this highlight 

334
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:49,130
is that he did eat the cherries out of,

335
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,040
of her agenda.
What a guy.

336
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:53,991
What a legend.
Yeah,

337
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,590
I love that.
I like the,

338
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,453
on the highlight.
There was a comment from some guy 

339
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:58,921
saying,
lady,

340
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:01,050
if you're watching this video,
I'm 300 pounds.

341
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,923
I put on weight.
I don't know if green Japan's qualifies 

342
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:08,670
yet because Mcgee said he was at like 
500.

343
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,803
That's right.
But I guess he's got lots of ways to go 

344
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,340
have a for feeder.
There's a lot.

345
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,450
It's a long road to go together.
Um,

346
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,600
oh this.
Now this one I completely forgot.

347
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:22,600
This was submitted by a fan and this is 
when we had ty Lopez on the cloud guys.

348
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,873
And we got him good because we had this 
video where we went to his house and he 

349
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:29,604
had a lawyer's,
a troop of lawyers following me the 

350
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:32,724
whole time.
We decided to get him back when he came 

351
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:40,590
on our own podcast and we hired an extra
that you found on craigslist,

352
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,390
right then?

353
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:41,940
Uh,
yeah.

354
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,160
Well I didn't actually.
Craigslist,

355
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,420
we all forgot that we did that one.
We saw the submission saying,

356
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,570
how'd you,
how'd you find them?

357
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:52,890
How to do,
what'd you mark put up?

358
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:56,070
Just need an actor for one day for like 
an hour.

359
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,460
I got a lot of weird people so that was 
a little but kind of comb through it.

360
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:02,694
And then he was very game.
We like put them in the closet because 

361
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,920
you never know what you're going to get 
with craigslist.

362
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:15,480
Especially actors are already all weird 
and craigslist senators bottom.

363
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,793
But you,
you hit the Jackpot with that guy 

364
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:19,620
because he was,
the guy was,

365
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,570
he played it completely straight.
It was amazing.

366
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,583
He sat in our tiny little closet room 
for like an hour at least just because 

367
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:28,640
we're like,
just being there,

368
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,953
need to use the bathroom,
go do it quick because you can't come 

369
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,953
back.

370
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,690
He was so game to totally cool,
but what did we pay them?

371
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:38,040
Do you remember?
I don't.

372
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,933
I don't remember.
Probably probably more than girls get 

373
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:41,814
for kissing.
Prank almost started a couple of 

374
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,250
hundred.
I mean it was an easy day for him.

375
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,400
A couple hours after he had a couple of 
hours.

376
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,610
I remember afterwards then he was like,
I know that guy.

377
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,520
He recognized,
ah,

378
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,150
I've seen his ass all over youtube.
Yeah,

379
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,320
exactly.
So here it is.

380
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,090
This is.
I watched this this morning.

381
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:04,110
I was like,
oh my God,

382
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:06,240
this is brilliant.
And he plays.

383
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:08,910
It is so straight to like you say,
wow,

384
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,650
that's noticeably flushed and walked 
down there.

385
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,740
I love that shot.
How do we set the camera up?

386
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,070
Look at Thai.
I took,

387
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:26,490
I took a picture out the window one hour
or two hours before.

388
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,760
Right event that festival.
Completely ignoring what was happening.

389
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:33,354
Yeah.
Crazy world wants to look at the world 

390
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,870
and he keeps imposing on him.
You,

391
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:41,704
uh,
you recently I was speaking at a 

392
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:47,850
conference well to

393
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,860
entrepreneurs',
wanting to scale their business for me.

394
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,960
Just can you just bring a little bit 
closer?

395
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,070
I just want you to miss anything.

396
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,330
Did you bring your lawyer?
Don't worry about he's not.

397
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:06,300
He's like an intern that's going to read
me my miranda rights.

398
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:14,530
Don't just try not to think about it.
No,

399
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,320
I'm just kidding.
He's got that.

400
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:26,430
He's got that lawyer getting the eyes.
Oh my God.

401
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,960
He's scaring me.
You're starting to scare me now.

402
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:34,860
So thanks for your service to us.
Very well done.

403
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:35,694
By the way.
Lots of intimidation there is going to 

404
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:37,704
serve me.

405
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,690
And now another favorite V set.
Our first bank ever.

406
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,900
Like kind of a frank.
Really early episode.

407
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:59,200
I want to say ty was like 16.
17 was pretty early.

408
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:00,670
Yeah.
Really it was.

409
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:02,520
It doesn't feel that long ago.
Now that I see it,

410
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:07,521
but Tai Lopez was a year ago.
Let's see this one or a number.

411
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,990
Thirty three little higher.
Um,

412
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,920
October fourth.
So it was over a year,

413
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,600
over a year.
What is this cold open?

414
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,640
The new episode of the Eighth Street.
What does this look at?

415
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:18,474
This shit.
Whenever we ever started the podcast 

416
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:21,354
starring your boy.
I remember when he had attorneys to 

417
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,860
explained that.
Yeah,

418
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,300
that's cute.
Wasn't this live?

419
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,830
Might've prerecorded.
It was prerecorded.

420
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,940
Yeah.
The SOS.

421
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,570
Michael here.
One of my all time favorite guests.

422
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,420
Another guy is an open book.
He's hilarious.

423
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:48,650
We talked to him about taking Iowasca,
which is a psychedelic drug.

424
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,793
Yes it is.
And I thought it was a wonderful 

425
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:55,520
conversation by the way.
I just realized that Dan is here.

426
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,700
It tells us about break time.
Oh,

427
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,380
it was telling us about.
Oh,

428
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,310
is it break?
I've been keeping an eye on the clock to

429
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,740
3:45
will be 30 minutes late.

430
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,900
Vsauce is coming back our first episode 
back 25th of January.

431
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:14,820
We'll,
we'll be joined by vsauce again.

432
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,380
So I'm very much looking forward to 
that.

433
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,980
But here he talks about taking a 
psychedelic drug,

434
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,870
um,
which is just the combination of him,

435
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,070
psychedelics and youtube red is just.
I love that.

436
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,480
Those three things together is not 
something you would expect that he had a

437
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:34,590
lot of interesting things to say.

438
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,480
Here's the thing.
My heart was going.

439
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,310
It was literally beating very fast.
I actually,

440
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:39,990
there's a moment where I touch my chest.
I'm like,

441
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:40,920
Yep,
that's really happening.

442
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,710
But then I thought,
how do I let the doctor know?

443
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,610
Because

444
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,480
I can't think,
no,

445
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,810
this is not how I normally feel.
Is it weird if I just say,

446
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,820
Hey,
I'm help,

447
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,260
how are they going to interpret that?
And so I just,

448
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,500
I thought maybe I'll just ask for water,
you know,

449
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,513
maybe that like will tether me back down
to reality because someone will have to 

450
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,120
bring me water.
And that's a really.

451
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,813
I've been there.
I feel like I've been in that headspace 

452
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,730
of training.

453
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,620
They're like,
I don't want to see me talk.

454
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,310
But um,
that was great.

455
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,293
Love vsauce talking about that too,
because he was so analytical about his 

456
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:19,824
experience,
which you know it most people who do 

457
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:22,554
that are looking for some sort of 
spiritual connection and he was more 

458
00:24:25,351 --> 00:24:30,270
just trying to like appreciate what was 
happening to him the entire time.

459
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,220
It was really cool to hear him talk 
about it.

460
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,130
Yeah,
I would,

461
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:33,963
I would,
I would like to just put Michael in a 

462
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,730
room and just give them all kinds of 
drugs and just,

463
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,000
Oh yeah,
record him.

464
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,380
Let's get that set up for the 25th.
I mean the new micro.

465
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,050
Here's a Mtma will leave,
you know,

466
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,870
tell us how you feel the new season is 
out.

467
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:50,430
I'm very much looking forward to.
Oh,

468
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:51,264
nice.
Now we're going to talk all about that 

469
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:53,304
on the 25th now.
Now garth brooks is somewhat of a 

470
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,400
phenomenon here and on other podcasts as
well because he's just such a legend and

471
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:05,550
there's one video specifically of 
Garth's that I love where he goes.

472
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,930
He's sitting in his hotel room.
Why don't I,

473
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,580
why don't we just watch it was,
I honestly can't.

474
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,070
I can't watch this too many times.
Garth Brooks face,

475
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,960
right?
Um,

476
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,160
I can't watch this video too many times.
It's truly a masterpiece.

477
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,870
Well,
I guess it's official.

478
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,303
We're now on facebook.
I really wasn't sure about this to 

479
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:27,780
start,
but then a friend of mine said something

480
00:25:27,781 --> 00:25:28,614
they just made also.
She said think of it more as a 

481
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:35,961
conversation,
but I'm already finding out on my own.

482
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,880
So it's wiping the walls out between you
and me.

483
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,550
And I really liked that.
It allows us into each other's world.

484
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:43,781
Good.
The,

485
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:45,480
uh,
title Garth Brooks,

486
00:25:45,481 --> 00:25:47,820
first facebook post and video.
Amazing.

487
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,340
Authentic and transparent.
One hundred percent.

488
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,780
That's funny because when I watched 
this,

489
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:53,550
I see like the opposite

490
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,030
my case.
Oh,

491
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,050
tell me about.
This.

492
00:26:01,051 --> 00:26:01,880
Reminds me of title

493
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,713
in,
in my garage video in that it tries to 

494
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:07,250
look authentic and natural,
but you know,

495
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,570
he's done it a thousand dollars.
Take 40,

496
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:10,404
you'd lose for sure.
Looks like the type of video you'd make 

497
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:15,650
from the bunker after the bombs have 
fallen.

498
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,160
I really like that.
You know,

499
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:19,994
it'd be fun is to just maybe do like a 
go fund me and then run this as a 

500
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,280
youtube provable.
Go find me for people to donate and then

501
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,483
you use all that money as a,
as a community and you use this as a 

502
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:37,580
youtube pre roll so people just get this
video.

503
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,030
Oh a go fund me to pay to have this as 
an APP.

504
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,040
So it's just constantly popping up.
That's kind of.

505
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,430
That's good.
I mean it's,

506
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,743
he's not selling anything but I wonder 
if you get pissed or if you'd loved 

507
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:52,910
that.
I really liked that.

508
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,053
Be like,
what the fuck?

509
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,163
I mean,
that'd be great.

510
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,000
Let's try it to go fund me.

511
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,490
Think about things I want to post to 
post cool stuff,

512
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,390
slick stuff,
neat stuff,

513
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,380
but most of the stuff I'm going to post 
it gonna be raw stuff like this.

514
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,760
That's just who I am.
Truly a conversation tonight.

515
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,440
Nice.
They let the conversation begin

516
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,443
and iconically after saying,
let the conversation begin and was the 

517
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,753
last video he ever poked?
Say let the compensation and incredible 

518
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,573
stuff.
I'd never seen that until you showed it 

519
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:33,780
to me and know I find myself doing that 
like that.

520
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:38,200
I liked helping people think you're 
being strange because they don't.

521
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,770
Oh,
I've done the without a doubt.

522
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,300
That happens to me a lot.
We used to watch it so many times,

523
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:45,220
but we didn't know what to do with it.
Like,

524
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,140
yeah,
I know but.

525
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,390
But it's wallet.
It was somewhat underground,

526
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,970
but I think a lot of people are picking 
up on it now.

527
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,013
But the great moment,
one of my favorite moments was we had 

528
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:55,084
Chris Delea on and I saw that he was a 
garth brooks fan and the similar sense 

529
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:04,600
that I was right and I says to him,
I pitched him this idea,

530
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,443
you,
I go,

531
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,303
you know what I want to do,
I want to recreate this video word for 

532
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,630
word and just post it.
And he's like,

533
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,810
I think I've done that.
Right?

534
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,663
So here.
And we discovered that he did it and he 

535
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:17,134
didn't even remember or recreate it.
I want to upload this to my youtube 

536
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:21,250
channel on edited.
I think.

537
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,940
I think I did this.
You did.

538
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,870
You recreated it.
I know,

539
00:28:28,871 --> 00:28:33,871
I know.
I sent the video to grow your role.

540
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,050
I know I sent it to Joe,
Bryan County.

541
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,520
I don't know if I ever uploaded it.

542
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,560
700 views.
It was some random person,

543
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:54,470
but somehow it's just five months.
Not even that long ago.

544
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:59,471
Oh yeah.
So somebody found him first.

545
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,960
I really wasn't sure about this start.
Oh,

546
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,590
so a friend of mine and I will say this,

547
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,660
I,
I didn't write it down.

548
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,583
I watched it.

549
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,940
Hi,
this is from A.

550
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,750
I remember I remember it.
Substrate feeling and authenticity.

551
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,030
Yeah.
I really liked that.

552
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,903
Has 50,000
different spray while saying that this 

553
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:30,500
exists brought up.
You thought you bring it up.

554
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,521
I'm like,
Bro.

555
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:36,380
I'm like,
well,

556
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,240
you're in a hotel room.
Right?

557
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,571
Right,
right.

558
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:41,404
Yeah.
Come on,

559
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,990
I'm immersed.
I guess it's official.

560
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:48,030
Ron facebook really wasn't sure about 
this,

561
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,573
but did.
A friend of mine said something that 

562
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,780
made all kinds of sense.
She said,

563
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:58,010
just think of it as a conversation.
I like that one.

564
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,933
I'm already noticing myself is that it's
wiping away the walls of communication 

565
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:04,120
between you and me.
Well,

566
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:09,121
I really liked that line.
Is an invitation to fuck.

567
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,460
Fuck,
fuck.

568
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:19,750
I think facebook wise.
Yeah,

569
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,810
yeah,
yeah,

570
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,643
yeah.
Everybody can see this each other's 

571
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,950
worlds,
or in my case,

572
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,100
my hotel room,
one of the cool stuff,

573
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,400
slick stuff,
neat stuff,

574
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:42,110
but I'm probably gonna end up posting 
stuff like this because it's who I am.

575
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,270
Well,
I guess if this is a conversation,

576
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,760
then I say lit.
The conversation began.

577
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,213
I

578
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,600
stumbled upon that,
like accidentally go and as he said,

579
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,443
it's now from 700 to 50,000.
Don't anyone ever say that we here at 

580
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:04,414
the podcast didn't make a difference 
bringing joy to the world on some guys 

581
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:13,481
channel it is break time now.
Oh,

582
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:14,384
it is break time.
So we have a lot more next week about 

583
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:17,684
posts.
Milan,

584
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,600
Patrice Wilson,
live spook.

585
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,900
That was not a job.
We've got so much,

586
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:27,920
so much more and then my worst moments 
coming up and then your guys as best and

587
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:31,070
worst moments coming up and putting it.
You do not go away guys.

588
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,050
This is episode 100.
Yes.

589
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,903
Getting started and I say let the 
conversation again and we'll be right 

590
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:41,084
back.
These days you can get practically 

591
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:47,810
everything on demand,
but why can't you get stamps?

592
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:50,390
Did you know that?
You can get postage on demand.

593
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,140
All you need is stamps.com
with stamps.com.

594
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,770
You can access all the services of the 
post office right from your desk.

595
00:31:57,771 --> 00:31:58,604
You can buy and print real us postage of
any letter or any package all available 

596
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:04,760
24 hours a day,

597
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:06,650
You just click print,
mail and boom,

598
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:08,210

It smells great.
Isla.

710
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,643
She's all over me,
but I think it's because of my clean 

711
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,920
butthole.
I could be wrong though.

712

episode of the podcast and look fondly 
back hard.

729
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,550
Um,
where was I posted?

730
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,460
Malone?
Never heard of.

731
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:30,210
Always a favorite.
Always a treasure to have them on.

732
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,670
But during,
was it his last appearance?

733
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,830
I think so.
Um,

734
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,130
there was the live show after that.
So yes,

735
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,410
um,
during one of his appearances here,

736
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:43,983
Patrice Wilson started live streaming 
some really creepy stuff that seemed to 

737
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:49,684
be directed towards me and we were 
watching this unfold live and it was 

738
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:54,890
very spooky.
So he,

739
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,350
so he started broadcasting just a shower
curtain.

740
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,610
Three x three was in the title.
Exactly.

741
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,570
And so we'll look for yourself.

742
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,030
Yeah.
Oh God,

743
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:15,060
I'm scared.
What is that creepy fucking screens,

744
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,070
dude?
I have chosen.

745
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:20,180
I didn't know there was so creepy.
It's like a CD screen,

746
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,110
like a screen with a gun in it.
He was just moving behind it.

747
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:24,944
No,
this is not a screen that scared the 

748
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:39,270
shit out.
Turn this off.

749
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,590
So we were all getting,
we were all getting the.

750
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,580
Yeah.
Uh,

751
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Patrice Wilson is already a guy that's 
just a little strange.

752
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,890
That's fair.
I think in the fairway,

753
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,750
but I just thought it really scared the 
shit out of me when I saw this and it.

754
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,110
And it continues.
So,

755
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,490
so this happened early on in the episode
and we closed it.

756
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:06,941
We're like,
all right,

757
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:08,410
we can't have.
This is way too scary.

758
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:13,830
And later on the live chat was saying 
he's back and it's changed and this part

759
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:19,630
really scared the shit out of me.
Here you have it.

760
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:24,890
He's got a countdown timer,
a graveyard posts in a cemetery.

761
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Griffey I love you.
Goodbye.

762
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:38,010
Goodbye.
I'll spend the night with you.

763
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,290
Well,
I'm worried about December first.

764
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:41,760
That's what I'm saying.
On December first,

765
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,403
let's do a getaway.
I don't want to be in la because he's 

766
00:40:45,721 --> 00:40:47,280
here.
Fuck that.

767
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,800
Let's just hold up with some shot.
He's fucking.

768
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,680
I've room in your house.
There's not.

769
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,990
It's a very vulnerable and it makes me 
very vulnerable.

770
00:40:57,991 --> 00:40:58,824
And you can attack from anyone here who 
knows the way worse now I've got a 

771
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,380
defensible high ground

772
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,680
when the time clock and ended,
we left the house.

773
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:09,514
We didn't want to be in the house just 
in case I want you hiding in a grocery 

774
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:12,784
store park.
So when the time when we got down to 

775
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:18,190
zero,
it was getting more provocative and more

776
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:19,360
threatening.
I felt.

777
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,850
And I felt so unsafe in our last house 
as well that I was like.

778
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,260
And we just had got.
Do we have shutter at the time?

779
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,070
I was really scared for shredder and so 
we,

780
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,020
we packed up,
we got shredder,

781
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:32,854
we went in the car and we just drove 
into a public parking lot and just held 

782
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:38,750
up for a couple of hours because I was 
like,

783
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:39,584
look,
I don't fucking know you guys up to at 

784
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:41,714
all.
No,

785
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,660
I would have done at least that town for
the day.

786
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:50,540
But then patrice was like,
why did everyone think this was creepy?

787
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,140
Rolling through a cemetery.

788
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,260
There was even more heat directly 
addressed to you at some point.

789
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:01,094
Yeah.
He was like,

790
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,480
I'm coming for you.
And like,

791
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,321
yeah,
no,

792
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:04,430
I know.
I know.

793
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,700
Um,
that was a wild one,

794
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,790
but it was special.
We shared it with post live and it was a

795
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,470
beautiful moment.
It's just one of many,

796
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,590
uh,
Jordan Peterson hits the vape God.

797
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:22,160
Now there's an internal debate and this 
office,

798
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,590
because we have retired,
the vape God.

799
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,633
And I think for guests like Jordan 
Peterson is so fantastic to have them 

800
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:30,494
hit it,
but isla hosted opinion and she's not 

801
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:35,050
necessarily wrong that it's really 
disgusting and weird requests,

802
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,770
but you know,
and I,

803
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:39,860
I appreciate that.
She thinks it's dirty,

804
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,650
but we keep it clean,
don't we?

805
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,670
Oh sure.
What you cleaned.

806
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,490
Yeah.
I and there's not much.

807
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,150
Yeah,
I mean we,

808
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,990
we wipe off the tube and sterilize it 
before somebody new hits it or whatever.

809
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,823
But um,
to me it's more so that it's like right 

810
00:42:58,191 --> 00:42:59,024
off the bat,
some people might feel obligated to do 

811
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:02,654
it when they really don't want to.
And then that starts the interview on a 

812
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:05,720
weird foot.
Well,

813
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,660
but we're,
I mean as I guess we're about to see the

814
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:11,150
person I thought would be like,
hell no.

815
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:13,580
And uh,
he was super down.

816
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:14,810
That's the problem,
right?

817
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,673
Is that you on one hand,
say this was a little strange and 

818
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:19,964
they're going to be uncomfortable,
but I know on the other hand you have 

819
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,030
moments like this.
Okay.

820
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,720
So I'm happy to comply.
Rip It.

821
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,860
Okay.
Sorry,

822
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,693
I just breathe out,
but then I got the button that rips 

823
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:35,570
nice.
He's fucking legendary.

824
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Damn.
You know the cops are battery powered.

825
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,160
He's Canadian.
Let's listen.

826
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,290
Let's be honest.
I mean they know.

827
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,430
They know how to do this up there.
I'm impressive.

828
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,160
I remember he said a rituals are 
important.

829
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,180
That's fine.
Was He the first one?

830
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,790
We may do that.
No,

831
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,660
we had hardly and Bobby Lee and 
everybody did it.

832
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:11,840
We had a lot of people doing it.
I feel like he was the first time I was.

833
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,530
He was thinking that too because it.
Yeah,

834
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,523
it doesn't.
It tastes like battery acid or some 

835
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:20,300
days.
Gotcha.

836
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,100
Sleeping that it goes through a 
definitely.

837
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,830
It makes it taste a little funky,
but it's all good.

838
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,640
He was unfazed back then.
It were older,

839
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,220
there was still

840
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,440
a clean hit,
but as time has gone on,

841
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:39,530
it hits so harsh that you feel like 
battery is the thing.

842
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,870
It was,
it was made as a prop and so you know,

843
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,340
it's not necessarily over the longterm.
So.

844
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,520
So what you're saying,
Dan,

845
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:48,354
is that we need to build a more,
a more resilient little regarding not a 

846
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:54,210
prop center,
if you,

847
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,240
if you own a vape company out there,
hit us up podcasts@hvhcproductions.com.

848
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,080
Well that was a special moment 
regardless of if it was right or wrong.

849
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,830
Justin Pranks,
Joel Osteen,

850
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,180
another great moment from last year's 
charity event,

851
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,513
we called it Joel Osteen is this mega 
preacher who was in the media at the 

852
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:19,710
time because he closed,
they had this horrible hurricane,

853
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,210
hurricane and tons of people were 
homeless and without shelter.

854
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:25,283
And Joel,
a man of God had this mega church and 

855
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,224
the worst area on the high ground,
completely unaffected by the flooding 

856
00:45:31,471 --> 00:45:34,080
and the church was closed.
He wasn't letting anybody in there.

857
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,423
So he was getting slammed all throughout
the media and we took it upon ourselves 

858
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:39,623
to vigilante justice.
And Justin calls in Joel Osteen and the 

859
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:46,920
woman who answers is just,
I mean,

860
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,980
lack of a better term,
a little bit of a loony tune.

861
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,450
I think that's more than fair.
Yeah.

862
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,113
So here we go.

863
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,570
Keep saying ricky,
do you.

864
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,960
Do you know someone named,
started talking to Ricky?

865
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:00,951
Todd.
Todd,

866
00:46:00,951 --> 00:46:01,371
todd,
todd.

867
00:46:01,371 --> 00:46:04,480
Todd.
What is.

868
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,380
What does any of this mean?
I'm confused.

869
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,190
If I were to translate this,
would it be.

870
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,750
Would it be like,
Hey,

871
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:12,584
don't let people into the building 
during the flood because we don't want 

872
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:18,254
the steps.
I heard you the first time I heard it 

873
00:46:27,861 --> 00:46:29,730
the first time.
What did Jesus?

874
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,570
Twenty 15,
2015 was a good year.

875
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,550
Flight News.
Flight News battles.

876
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,850
Is that a magazine or what are you 
talking about?

877
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,610
I am so confused right now because it's 
supposed to be some kind of.

878
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,910
Yes.
Oh,

879
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,390
it's apparel line per line where you 
just ramble.

880
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,320
Crazy.
Nonsense.

881
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,460
What language is this?
I just,

882
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,560
I'm going to call my translator so I can
follow the conversation.

883
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,830
Keep pop,
pop,

884
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:12,741
pop,
pop,

885
00:47:12,741 --> 00:47:13,250
pop,
pop,

886
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:13,710
Tuck,
Tuck,

887
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:15,050
tuck.
Ricky,

888
00:47:15,051 --> 00:47:15,880
taxi.
Puppy.

889
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,280
Topic topic.
Ricky ticky.

890
00:47:19,281 --> 00:47:20,510
Tacky Paki.
Pocket talky.

891
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,353
Talky.
Laughing at it because you know it's 

892
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:28,190
funny because it's ridiculous.
That's why you're laughing right now.

893
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:29,843
I just

894
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,220
made the demon.
Satan.

895
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,370
This is a thing apparently.
Yeah,

896
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:39,620
yeah,
yeah.

897
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:44,040
It's part of the ritual to a purge the 
evil out of her phone calls.

898
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:46,240
Dude,
that was so crazy.

899
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,810
That was so much more insane than I ever
could have expected.

900
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,140
You have to.
Yes.

901
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,920
He seems kind of.
I may get some out of that.

902
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:54,754
Do we still have that number?
You want to call it a couple of Ricky 

903
00:47:58,211 --> 00:47:59,870
ticky tack?
Yeah.

904
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:05,690
We'll take shit too far.
This is what this is Christianity on.

905
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:11,100
This is what happens when you overdose 
on Christianity at the blood of Jesus.

906
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,593
Oh my God.
Everything in moderation with folks to 

907
00:48:15,891 --> 00:48:17,370
keep talking to you.
Fuck you.

908
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,953
Fuck you're dying of Shit.
She's going to put me up to the next 

909
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:29,830
level was prayer line.
She's like,

910
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,800
I'm putting.
I'm putting time speaking in tongues.

911
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,820
I cannot believe that was a special 
moment.

912
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:40,654
Yeah.
Wow.

913
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,350
I mean,
yeah,

914
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:44,780
find someone that's just start speaking 
in tongues and laughing.

915
00:48:44,781 --> 00:48:45,040
Okay.

916
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,980
Damon is a beautiful moment.
I remembered that made national news,

917
00:48:49,981 --> 00:48:54,060
but like there were like article about 
viral moment,

918
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:54,870
right?
Yeah.

919
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:55,703
Also,
the previous one made it into articles 

920
00:48:57,361 --> 00:48:58,194
with post malone because he was saying 
he was talking about when the dream was 

921
00:49:01,711 --> 00:49:06,570
going to end December first he joked,
he joked and then people thought.

922
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:09,740
We said that was the day beer bongs and 
belly and the drama and everything.

923
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:10,603
Refer.
Billboard was like thought that was the 

924
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,133
data release,
just goofing around and then act on 

925
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:17,514
December first.
I felt bad because he had to tweet out 

926
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:22,260
Saturday.
Everybody album's not coming out today.

927
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,830
It was so obviously joking.
What the hell people.

928
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,120
Oh yeah,
that was great.

929
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:30,540
I mean huge like rolling stone billboard
poster,

930
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:33,960
loan reveals and when I saw those 
articles I was like,

931
00:49:33,961 --> 00:49:35,250
wait,
where did he say that?

932
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:38,140
And then to find that it was our 
strategy.

933
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,053
Talking about poetry.
It's funny because they don't mention 

934
00:49:42,031 --> 00:49:42,240
this yet.

935
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,073
No,
they're just like post Malone said 

936
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,420
bastards.
They had mentioned the show.

937
00:49:48,421 --> 00:49:49,560
People would have been like,
oh,

938
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,520
it's not serious.
Right.

939
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:52,051
Jack.
Now,

940
00:49:52,051 --> 00:49:52,884
this was a moment that I personally 
loved is that the night before the Jack 

941
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,073
Black episode aired,
Justin reuland reached out to me and he 

942
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:03,720
said,
do you know that I used to,

943
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,550
I met Jack Black Lung,
the goal,

944
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:08,910
and he helped me pitch and sell my first
show ever.

945
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,240
And he's a huge inspiration to me and 
was a huge help to me.

946
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,340
And he sent me all this incredible 
media,

947
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,920
like pictures that said,
what did it say?

948
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,580
Keep,
um,

949
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,360
doors down,
knocked the doors down,

950
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,993
um,
and he had even done a cameo in his 

951
00:50:24,901 --> 00:50:27,980
first show that he sold.
And Jack talking about how

952
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,933
like,
um,

953
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,133
Bob Odenkirk,
Bob Odenkirk and David Cross had given 

954
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:37,160
them their big break by putting them on 
Mr Show.

955
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,560
And so that Kinda gave me the perfect 
end to be like,

956
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:42,130
well,
somebody at you,

957
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,490
you've apparently,
uh,

958
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:44,780
you know,
passed it on.

959
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:46,403
This was a beautiful moment.
I understand that from a mutual friend 

960
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:50,090
of ours.
You are also an advocate.

961
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,940
I have,
I have a surprise,

962
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,253
somewhat of a surprise in what God is.
Am I going to be surprised by someone 

963
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,720
from blast from my past going to enter 
the room?

964
00:50:58,770 --> 00:50:59,990
I think so,
no.

965
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:01,970
I'm really excited.
A friend of mine,

966
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,833
I launched out.
God because he heard you were going to 

967
00:51:04,071 --> 00:51:06,950
be a show and I don't know that you've 
seen this.

968
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:08,990
He said,
but I think that you want to say for the

969
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:09,824
record,
I think that's one of my favorite 

970
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:11,930
episodes we've ever done.
Yeah,

971
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:12,764
I know it's recent,
but honestly like to have the best 

972
00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:14,930
guests we've ever had.

973
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,400
Just so cool.
So funny.

974
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,790
They hung out before and after they sang
for us after that.

975
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,090
It was incredible.
We probably never.

976
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,230
Was that like,
can we have a wii?

977
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:25,880
So Zach,
who's our sound lad,

978
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,970
he's a musician.
He shreds on guitar.

979
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:31,310
Well thank you very much.
And He um,

980
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,253
kyle gas is like a crazy shredder.
And so Zach and Kyle and Jack started 

981
00:51:37,731 --> 00:51:39,420
jamming and sinking.
Yeah.

982
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,390
Zach knew a master exploder,
which was a tenacious d song and uh,

983
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,310
I think it was asking Kyle about his 
guitar.

984
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,031
It was like,
here,

985
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:49,460
take a look or whatever.
And he just started busting out into the

986
00:51:49,461 --> 00:51:52,670
song and like I had like a split second 
moment of like,

987
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,600
oh,
like,

988
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,290
you know,
don't try and show them up or whatever.

989
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,693
I was completely wrong.
They immediately just launched into the 

990
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:02,210
song and they like play the entire song 
with him,

991
00:52:02,211 --> 00:52:03,800
sing the whole thing.
It was so cool.

992
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,150
How was that for you,
Zach?

993
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:07,490
Who was one of the highlights of my 
life.

994
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:14,340
I do have a video of it on my phone,
but I said,

995
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,680
oh Sheila,
to get that up.

996
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,193
Maybe we can tweet it later.
Something to eat it later from the 

997
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:19,910
podcast flutter.
That'd be great.

998
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:20,763
It was insane.
It was just like he started singing and 

999
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:25,010
that was just like,
oh my God,

1000
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:26,480
I can't believe this is happening right 
now.

1001
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:31,230
I could tell on Zach's been living out a
fantasy for us.

1002
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,200
Yeah,
they really,

1003
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:35,720
I mean those guys.
And Jack Black is such a legend.

1004
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:36,554
Like man,
I used to be obsessed with his HBO 

1005
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:41,150
series is one of the funniest things 
ever.

1006
00:52:41,151 --> 00:52:44,870
And originally it really when we were 
researching for them coming in.

1007
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:46,820
Um,
as part of that,

1008
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:49,280
I went back and watched some of it had 
been years.

1009
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:53,180
I haven't seen it in forever.
Completely holds up so funny.

1010
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:56,620
So it doesn't hold up.
Hold up.

1011
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,193
I find this joke a fairly tasteless.
You remember the but babies in the 

1012
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,950
desert where Kyle gives handled birth.
Oh my God,

1013
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:07,040
I love that.
So good.

1014
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,700
But at any rate where we be joined by 
it.

1015
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:12,170
Wow.
You will be joined by.

1016
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:14,420
You will be joined by.
It's never been Lloyd.

1017
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,480
So hang on.
Here we go.

1018
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,720
Tell me if you recognize this.
Oh my God.

1019
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,000
It's just an reuland.
Yeah.

1020
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,280
Oh my God.
So speaking

1021
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,830
of Virginia,
so Justin Reuland,

1022
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:34,550
Jack Black helped Justin reuland pitch 
and sell his first show as eap.

1023
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,353
Wow.
Jack helped him get his foot in the 

1024
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:41,160
door.
No,

1025
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,930
by the way,
Jack is amazing.

1026
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,700
He helped me and he believed in me and I
just want to say hi and thank you.

1027
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,120
And that he loves.
What a mench.

1028
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,430
Well,
let me see because you did.

1029
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,283
It can be able to convey that sincerity 
to Jack Black come up as good as it 

1030
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:03,030
gets.
Definitely.

1031
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:07,440
And the fact that Justin had the picture
still as good as it gathers polaroids.

1032
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:08,220
I guess they are.
Let me,

1033
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,150
let me find that for thing.
But he doesn't throw away and I know.

1034
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,630
I know in Jack.
Actually,

1035
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:13,893
I never conveyed what Justin said 
because I showed them that clip and he 

1036
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,470
cracked up laughing when Jack was like,
oh,

1037
00:54:19,471 --> 00:54:22,350
Justin's a saver.
Because Justin is a hoarder.

1038
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:23,183
When you go in his house,
you're going to tell this guy doesn't 

1039
00:54:24,991 --> 00:54:27,420
throw anything out there it is.
There it is.

1040
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,010
Modest.
But he.

1041
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,510
This is what he told me.
Okay,

1042
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:33,510
look,
I couldn't believe he sent me this photo

1043
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:35,550
last night.
Blow doors down.

1044
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:42,050
He's a saver,
but I can't believe how young men.

1045
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,680
He's a different person.
He's a sweet kid.

1046
00:54:49,681 --> 00:54:50,514
Dude.
Look at him.

1047
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,650
I was wild.
I know.

1048
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:57,570
Look at that little genius.
Just a true genius.

1049
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,780
Oh God.
He's like,

1050
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:07,490
he's like one of these crazy geniuses 
that are fearless and like on hesitant,

1051
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,633
you know,
like he doesn't have a filter in the 

1052
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:12,030
best way possible.
And he's just,

1053
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,370
he embraces these,
like his game coming out.

1054
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:17,190
It's so imaginative and it's just,
it's like,

1055
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:18,840
so uniquely him,
you know,

1056
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:20,700
it's almost no one else could have made 
it,

1057
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:25,050
but him,
he really is such a creative force and a

1058
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:26,483
truly an honor to consider him a friend 
and this was just really one of my 

1059
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:33,510
favorite moments probably.
So there you have it.

1060
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,250
Next,
what do we got?

1061
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,530
Oh,
here's a great one.

1062
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:41,970
I'm almost done with my list.
By the way.

1063
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:46,650
Martin scarelli admits to doing crimes 
alive.

1064
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,700
I couldn't believe I forgot this.
This is legendary.

1065
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,693
This was another one of those unplanned,
beautiful genius moments where we're 

1066
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,504
having a live show with,
I think it was eric and Jesse wellons 

1067
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,673
and somebody,
and this was right after scarelli got 

1068
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:07,740
like a sentence that are convicted.
He was convicted.

1069
00:56:07,741 --> 00:56:08,574
It was before the sentencing,
which is is key to why this was so 

1070
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:13,884
amazing because it was very much 
underplaying how much punishment was 

1071
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:20,010
coming as well.
He didn't know and he,

1072
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:20,893
he seemed pretty confident when he was 
saying he seemed to have the feeling 

1073
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:27,700
that he was getting off with a slap on 
the wrist and he,

1074
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:28,990
he asks us,
well,

1075
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:30,040
how much?
He's like,

1076
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:30,874
I'm not admitting anything but how,
how much jail time would you do for 

1077
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:34,600
$100,000,000?

1078
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,760
And we're like,
what do you mean by that?

1079
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:37,623
How did it happen?
We were just talking about him and then 

1080
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:40,594
he and he was streaming and then I 
started watching our stream on history 

1081
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,533
back.
I just keeping an eye on the chat and 

1082
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:49,360
people were just started spamming in the
chat.

1083
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:50,410
Hey,
uh,

1084
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,320
Martin Shkreli is like streaming right 
now.

1085
00:56:53,321 --> 00:56:55,570
And he's watching you guys was like,
what the fuck?

1086
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:57,430
Sure enough.
So we're like,

1087
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,790
well we've got,
we've got to get squirelly on here if we

1088
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:02,650
can.
And after you know,

1089
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:03,484
trying to align it up,
we finally figured out and got them on 

1090
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,373
and and well here,
let me play the clip for you because 

1091
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:13,330
this truly.
He's in prison right now and I've always

1092
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:18,420
suspected that this clip of him on our 
show was played before the judge,

1093
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:23,440
once before sensitive thinking.
He goes,

1094
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:27,770
listen to this,
listen to this crazy question.

1095
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:33,460
If you could make $100,000,000,
but you had to go to jail,

1096
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:37,120
how much time would you do?
Is this related to your situation?

1097
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,420
Totally.
Totally unrelated because you just spent

1098
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,930
$30,000
and I flick your answer was sarcastic.

1099
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,070
It seems to be a little bit of.

1100
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:55,780
I mean for how much water mill?
Hundred million.

1101
00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:01,590
If I fucking Tony Sorento for $100,
million dollars,

1102
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:04,980
how much time would you do?
He asked just money.

1103
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:07,840
How much time would I do?
And My,

1104
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:09,520
my,
you're the orange.

1105
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:10,354
Is the new black.
Is it on the expense of people who 

1106
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:16,080
suffers straight up like,
hey,

1107
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,710
serve a year.
Here's a bunch of money.

1108
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,720
Nobody suffers.
What would you.

1109
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,760
What would you.
What would you do?

1110
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,570
Zero to zero to 30.
Oh,

1111
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:30,780
zero to 30 days.
Criminal especially sense.

1112
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:38,620
So even if you assume I'm guilty of not 
coming out of this with over 100 million

1113
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:43,621
dollars and he locked the judge took all
pretty much all of his money.

1114
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:48,811
Right?
Including honestly when,

1115
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:51,730
why even go on at that point.
But he's a cocky bitch.

1116
00:58:51,731 --> 00:58:53,920
He couldn't help but brag.
Right?

1117
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,600
And if he couldn't come help,
uh,

1118
00:58:55,601 --> 00:58:58,780
come on and be like,
if you could make $100,000,000,

1119
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,550
how much time would you do it?

1120
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,413
Kept it kept going on,
on this trans about how people just 

1121
00:59:03,431 --> 00:59:04,264
don't understand that he's not scamming 
anyone is just messing with the 

1122
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:09,940
insurance companies to help fund more 
research.

1123
00:59:09,941 --> 00:59:12,110
And this dream.
I've,

1124
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,010
I've learned a lot more about the topic 
and it was totally.

1125
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:16,783
That's the talking point of all these 
pharmaceutical companies who jacked the 

1126
00:59:19,961 --> 00:59:20,794
price up like a times.
They always say the same thing that he 

1127
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:26,300
was saying and I guess he convinced some
people that that's true,

1128
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:28,070
but what they say is,
oh,

1129
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:30,680
well,
by raising the price of 100 times,

1130
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:33,710
we make it more accessible,
which is like a total,

1131
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:35,600
like double speak,
counterintuitive,

1132
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,613
but they say it gives us more money for 
research and it helps us subsidize 

1133
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,034
people who can't afford it except that 
there's actually no evidence of any of 

1134
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:45,980
these guys giving it out for free.
Like they supposedly say they do.

1135
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,173
Well.
And also the people that pay for it as 

1136
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:48,974
health insurance and government and 
social security so ends up costing 

1137
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:53,180
taxpayers like a billion dollars.

1138
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,090
Yeah.
Or more,

1139
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,640
probably a lot more.
But uh,

1140
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,180
at any rate,
um,

1141
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,840
and he also wasn't in that clip,
but I remember in that interview,

1142
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,830
um,
he was like,

1143
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:02,743
I'll get six months.
That was his destiny and it's seven 

1144
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:07,900
years,
more than six months.

1145
01:00:07,901 --> 01:00:10,200
And then they took money and they took 
the Wu Tang album.

1146
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:11,670
I mean,
there.

1147
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:12,630
Yeah,
there you have it.

1148
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:17,950
His story is one that's just so 
fascinating that he became so notorious.

1149
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,513
Like he,
he said it in this interview and he's 

1150
01:00:20,991 --> 01:00:21,824
right,
there's way bigger offenders than he is 

1151
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:25,970
that are way more powerful and way more 
wealthy and way more.

1152
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,290
I would say,
well,

1153
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:28,183
I don't know about way more,
but they are predatory on a larger 

1154
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:32,720
scale.
They will avoid scrutiny.

1155
01:00:32,721 --> 01:00:35,810
But somehow he was made notorious by the
media,

1156
01:00:35,811 --> 01:00:38,180
I guess because he's put himself out 
there probably.

1157
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,073
Yes.
Sacrifice the anonymity that the other 

1158
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:45,110
guys like cherish in exchange for being 
like a meme,

1159
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,300
a meme,
Lord in the public eye.

1160
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:50,310
So you want it to be a cool,
edgy.

1161
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,200
He paid the ultimate price.
It is an interesting thing though,

1162
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:55,034
because I mean,
his big mistake in a way was just being 

1163
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,310
honest about what he was doing.
Like he just,

1164
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,380
he was kind of weird.
How is that?

1165
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:03,680
I mean,
uh,

1166
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,513
you know,
trying to make that argument that it 

1167
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:06,920
wasn't fraud.
I mean,

1168
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,510
obviously the court did not agree with 
that.

1169
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,810
Um,
but,

1170
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:13,880
but just raising the money and 
everything,

1171
01:01:13,881 --> 01:01:14,540
you know,
he,

1172
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,790
he,
what he said oftentimes was just,

1173
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,750
you know,
all these companies do this.

1174
01:01:18,751 --> 01:01:19,584
Um,
I agree.

1175
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,040
I agree.
No,

1176
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,570
that wasn't on their investigations.
Now,

1177
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,180
maybe not all,
but a lot of them are.

1178
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,673
Well,
he lost in the court of public opinion 

1179
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:29,564
and that's why everyone went after him,
but we have to be Hillary Clinton's DNA 

1180
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:33,440
to.

1181
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,420
Oh,
that's great.

1182
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:36,763
That's the reason he ended up going to 
prison is because he was on probation 

1183
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:45,610
and then he made a tweet sarcastically 
asking anyone to get a sample of Hillary

1184
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:50,160
Clinton's DNA so we could clone her.
Said I have the sequences,

1185
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,690
and so the judge determined that he was 
hilarious,

1186
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:00,120
but it wasn't worth it.
They joke like probation.

1187
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:01,143
He was out on bail and bond and they 
removed his bail is a judge that he was 

1188
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:07,730
a threat to public safety,
but actually he did.

1189
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:10,520
He ended up going to prison for.
It had nothing to do with the medicine.

1190
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:12,920
It was.
He defrauded investors,

1191
01:02:12,921 --> 01:02:13,790
have a,
have a,

1192
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:17,870
a hedge fund.
Amazing stuff.

1193
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,110
Well,
yeah.

1194
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:19,943
It's like

1195
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,323
you're involved in so many shady things.
You went to prison for the one that 

1196
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:27,560
always the good guy.
He's the good guy to him.

1197
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,050
Always remember Squirelly for rip her 
Rhombi.

1198
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,233
Yeah.
Let's pull that up because that is 

1199
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,093
generally up.
I'd watch a scary movie that's probably 

1200
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:40,280
coming late.
What does that mean?

1201
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:41,213
Wait,
you would watch?

1202
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,060
Oh yeah.
I would watch.

1203
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,353
Let's.
Let's do it.

1204
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,700
This is literally straight later.
He's a fascinating guy and I'll tell you

1205
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:48,534
what,
every time you he's streaming or 

1206
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:50,304
something,
he's always sitting alone home by 

1207
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:54,330
himself,
like he's like the loneliest dude ever.

1208
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:58,260
It's pretty sad,
but here he is trolling CBS.

1209
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:58,980
Now

1210
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:59,813
further away you talk about being upset.
Harambie who is the gorilla that was 

1211
01:03:03,181 --> 01:03:04,014
killed at the Cincinnati Zoo on twitter?
Talk about caring so much about them 

1212
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,373
that the life meant so much.
The Cincinnati Zoo was come out and 

1213
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,460
asked people to stop using means and 
you've.

1214
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,840
You've used it,
a lot of memes and social media.

1215
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:24,530
How is this going to stop in order to 
honor him?

1216
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,760
So it was sort of moonlighting.
Scientists,

1217
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:28,613
you know,
I,

1218
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,730
I work a lot with nonhuman primates.
We call them in the labs NHP.

1219
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:36,150
So any rhesus monkeys capuchins all the 
way up to the higher orders.

1220
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:41,700
While my brother and I especially have 
this deep fondness for,

1221
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:46,050
for animals that are so close to humans,
so remarkably close,

1222
01:03:46,051 --> 01:03:46,884
in fact,
there are Benobos that can even 

1223
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:48,803
communicate with you on a one to one 
level and tell jokes and be sarcastic 

1224
01:03:52,381 --> 01:03:53,760
and funny and even flirt with you.

1225
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:56,520
It's unbelievable how humanlike these 
creatures are.

1226
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:01,730
An idea that we just shot this whole one
day is the argument that is,

1227
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,900
to be honest,
it's painful to even talk about this,

1228
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:14,640
but back to the issue which is that in 
in this country,

1229
01:04:14,641 --> 01:04:18,540
I don't think we value nonhuman primate 
life the way we should.

1230
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,700
I think these animals actually should 
have rights.

1231
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,380
We it or not,
if they did Martin,

1232
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:24,960
they wouldn't be able to be used in the 
pharmaceutical industry,

1233
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:27,150
which don't think,
I don't think they should be.

1234
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,090
You know,
I do a lot of and I've,

1235
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:29,993
I've,
I've overseen the death of thousands of 

1236
01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:38,121
these animals.
Rats and many times the overseeing.

1237
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:40,383
Absolutely.
Every single pharmaceutical executive 

1238
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,584
house,
a Pfizer probably kills a million 

1239
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:46,130
animals here.
It's completely true.

1240
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:47,680
That's fair to them.
You know,

1241
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:48,890
if that doesn't,
I can't tell.

1242
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,490
I can't either,

1243
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:51,363
no,
because actually I do agree with what 

1244
01:04:53,911 --> 01:04:54,790
he's saying,
but that,

1245
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,850
but it's such a troll.
It's hard to get a read on

1246
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:02,170
when you talk about that.
It feels like it is very,

1247
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,440
it was a moral decision.
It's,

1248
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:06,490
it's how you feel morally and yet when 
you talk about drug prices,

1249
01:05:06,491 --> 01:05:07,900
when we were talking earlier,
and,

1250
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,180
and I know you're saying it should go to
the insurance company,

1251
01:05:10,181 --> 01:05:11,860
is it's,
it's up to the insurance companies.

1252
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,173
But why not have that same moral 
compassion for the way the system is 

1253
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,930
more moral,
compassionate?

1254
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:17,651
You know,
I mean,

1255
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:18,640
uh,
I think that,

1256
01:05:18,641 --> 01:05:20,000
uh,
there's a lot of them,

1257
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,250
for instance,
7,000

1258
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,084
rare diseases.
There's only five or six companies in 

1259
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:26,080
the world that care about those 
diseases.

1260
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,190
The pfizers,
the mercks,

1261
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:29,500
the ASTRAZENECAS.
I care about the big sellers,

1262
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,270
but there's dying kids,
friends of mine,

1263
01:05:31,271 --> 01:05:33,390
like the closer brother's three kids 
with Pekin.

1264
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,220
I invented the first drug ever for Pekin
and these three kids,

1265
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:37,630
they are staring at their death 
sentence.

1266
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,690
They're teenagers.
And uh,

1267
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:43,690
I'm fighting my butt off to,
to save them and need money to do that.

1268
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,180
Investors don't care for these little 
diseases and so forth,

1269
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:48,490
so I think that a lot more compassion 
than most people think.

1270
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,490
That's why I'm in the drug business,
but at the same time a nonhuman,

1271
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,790
I find it also happens to be the most 
lucrative,

1272
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:57,170
but at any rate,
rest in peace around.

1273
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,013
We went down the hall a little bit too 
far and finally my favorite top moment 

1274
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:05,250
is dis.
Doctor disrespect,

1275
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:08,500
jumping through the roof and here we 
have.

1276
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:11,550
All right.
Let's see.

1277
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,140
Yeah,
let's see here.

1278
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,620
You have knocked as well.
Wait a minute.

1279
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:21,680
Knocked his hair back.
Hold on a second.

1280
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,650
Look at me.
I forgot I got all dressed up like that.

1281
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,600
I need to do something in that 
character.

1282
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:29,170
Character is great.
Professor Prophecy.

1283
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:33,590
We may have another clip of prophecy.
Oh,

1284
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,600
we have one coming up.
This was a pretty special episodes.

1285
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,260
I'm God,
we got to do something.

1286
01:06:40,261 --> 01:06:43,650
I like that get a lot,
but you know,

1287
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,220
worth mentioning is that a lot of people
criticized us.

1288
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:48,960
By the way,
I don't have any problem showing.

1289
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:53,610
He's clearly shown himself out of 
costume now as many of you have seen,

1290
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:57,660
but a lot of people were angry because 
in fact they weren't even saying,

1291
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,950
well,
this is the highlight.

1292
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,390
Yeah.
Um,

1293
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:05,390
they were even saying that we purposely 
such wishes.

1294
01:07:05,551 --> 01:07:08,730
I always resented that because first of 
all,

1295
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:10,890
what chocolate,
what happened?

1296
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:11,813
Oh,
at the end of the episode we always go 

1297
01:07:13,351 --> 01:07:14,184
to like a slate and go to the wide.
And so as soon as immediately as the is 

1298
01:07:17,551 --> 01:07:19,560
done,
he takes off his wig and classes and you

1299
01:07:19,561 --> 01:07:20,394
see him at a character.
But we do that at the end of every 

1300
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:23,440
episode.
And I,

1301
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,273
I,
I had no way to know that he was going 

1302
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:28,940
to take everything off immediately.
Our attention.

1303
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:29,940
I just did that,
right?

1304
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,520
Yeah.
It's not actually in the episode because

1305
01:07:32,521 --> 01:07:34,680
we cut it out.
It was only in the twitch.

1306
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,990
On twitch.
Yeah.

1307
01:07:36,991 --> 01:07:41,400
Actually somebody submitted a stock sing
a hymn,

1308
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,730
doxing him as their worst moment in the 
email.

1309
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:47,550
So I actually do have that clip because 
somebody re uploaded it,

1310
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,103
which made sense.
Then he is showing himself a bunch of 

1311
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:52,920
times even before,
by the way,

1312
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:56,010
even before that I did,
but hey,

1313
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,640
what can you say?
There's a piece.

1314
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,710
There's always someone to complain,
but not intentional.

1315
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:02,840
No,
of course not.

1316
01:08:02,841 --> 01:08:06,780
People always assume the worst.
I've found they did it on purpose.

1317
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,640
Yeah,
it was a huge plant.

1318
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,420
That's the only reason I went.
Okay,

1319
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,160
we're over and I'll take off your wig.
Right?

1320
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,133
So there you have it.
Now I've got two worst moments to share 

1321
01:08:20,091 --> 01:08:23,090
with you guys just selected by you.
These are selected by me.

1322
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,080
Okay.
Now,

1323
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:26,330
first of all,
worst moment we go way,

1324
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:27,164
way back to our first live episode.
I'm sure you guys have all seen this 

1325
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:33,860
Joji Mehmed on me.
So bad way.

1326
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:38,861
This was framed up just that we were 
doing.

1327
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,610
We were.
We were like hours in.

1328
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,180
I was so drunk at this time.
We were just chit chatting.

1329
01:08:44,181 --> 01:08:48,620
I think we were talking about how like 
in the animal kingdom,

1330
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,800
let's look at shredder.
He's,

1331
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:53,250
he's a serial rapist.
Okay.

1332
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,170
Our dog and Fred or goes to the dog 
park.

1333
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:56,780
No,
seriously.

1334
01:08:56,781 --> 01:08:59,360
He goes out there and he'll fuck 
anything that moves.

1335
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:01,600
He doesn't ask for consent.
It will try.

1336
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,520
And my only point is that back in the 
day,

1337
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,400
human beings like neanderthals or 
whatever,

1338
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:09,350
earlier form,
even apes,

1339
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,160
they're out there.

1340
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,210
They're,
I don't know that they're,

1341
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:13,380
they fuck they,
you know what I'm saying?

1342
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:15,170
Just I'll say.
Okay.

1343
01:09:15,171 --> 01:09:17,900
Does that make sense?
It was just like,

1344
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,700
not,
not thinking research,

1345
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:22,530
just some stupid like conversation.
Right.

1346
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:24,530
Which is always what people get upset 
about,

1347
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,450
which is a couple of people shooting the
shit.

1348
01:09:29,451 --> 01:09:31,190
All right.
Just a fucking idiot.

1349
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,053
I didn't pretend to be anything more 
than just a fucking idiot and in this 

1350
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:36,680
case a drunk idiot.
But that being said,

1351
01:09:36,681 --> 01:09:38,570
I don't think anyone was actually 
offended by this,

1352
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:39,404
but it was just funny how it played out.
So here I am talking about that or apps 

1353
01:09:43,581 --> 01:09:44,270
or whatever.
Right.

1354
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:45,103
Our Art Watch,
neanderthal eulogies were probably just 

1355
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:48,163
breaking like crazy.
So there's definitely a neanderthal in 

1356
01:09:50,931 --> 01:09:53,240
us to like conquer men want to like grow
up.

1357
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:54,590
So it's,
you know,

1358
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:59,240
women are in a nature setting,
like to be conquered.

1359
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:05,230
It came out and it was super weird and 
Super Long Island.

1360
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:09,760
Actually the most brilliant part about 
it.

1361
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:10,783
Yeah.
The most brilliant part about this is 

1362
01:10:12,111 --> 01:10:14,400
that I'm sure he didn't know his face 
was in.

1363
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,090
It's just pure,
genuine,

1364
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,800
pure,
genuine reaction.

1365
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:27,160
It's pure silence,
man.

1366
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,510
You got me good.
Look at that shot.

1367
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:35,760
Oh stole.
I still see this posted all the time.

1368
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:39,850
I don't think I'll ever live that.
You got my good.

1369
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:42,380
And then there's.
I have an honorable mention.

1370
01:10:42,381 --> 01:10:46,910
This is a new.
This is a new moment and I can't tell if

1371
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:47,744
it's the best or worst.
So here we are entering a new moment 

1372
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:56,870
into the lexicon.
I saw this on the subreddit.

1373
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:58,183
Someone who follows my dad on twitter.
Now you know when somebody likes 

1374
01:11:00,951 --> 01:11:02,900
something on twitter,
blows up on their feed.

1375
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:04,453
So someone decided to follow my dad on 
twitter and he posted this on the 

1376
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,940
subreddit and dad,
I love you,

1377
01:11:10,941 --> 01:11:12,710
but you got to know something.

1378
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:16,290
Things just you can't do.
You're a public figure.

1379
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:20,040
Now Dad.
Gary liked a.

1380
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:24,780
you've got a few hours left on abby 
snaps to see how sexy yesterday was.

1381
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:29,370
It's a girl eating out another girl,
dad.

1382
01:11:29,371 --> 01:11:31,260
You don't have to like,
like,

1383
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:34,320
like you don't have to like porn elite 
if you're going to look at it,

1384
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:37,330
you don't have to slam a like on a 
cruise.

1385
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:37,801
Yeah,
he,

1386
01:11:37,801 --> 01:11:42,300
my dad got Ted Cruz told him that you 
discovered this or I showed it to him.

1387
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:43,890
I said,
I said,

1388
01:11:43,891 --> 01:11:45,120
dad,
just so you know,

1389
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:48,640
is he watching the stream right now?
Probably Dad.

1390
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:52,920
Just so you have to like it.
It shows up on other people's feet.

1391
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,300
Had to play it off.
Cool.

1392
01:11:54,301 --> 01:11:56,220
He was like,
he said something like,

1393
01:11:56,221 --> 01:11:58,410
freedom with a bunch of exclamation 
marks,

1394
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:05,160
a legend and a dad find.
Look at porn.

1395
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:09,000
You don't have to like it,
but I can just imagine this poor guy who

1396
01:12:09,001 --> 01:12:11,060
followed him,
who decided to follow my gut.

1397
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:15,580
Just scrolling this twitter feed.
Now Gary likes.

1398
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:21,060
It's such an old people facebook thing.
It's so brutal.

1399
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:24,830
I can't decide if that's the worst,
but there you have a gear.

1400
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:29,170
So I will now pass it off to you.
Uh,

1401
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:31,810
you want to switch seats with me or no

1402
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,833
man,
it's.

1403
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:34,440
So.
It's just two links.

1404
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:38,480
So set aside,
oh well,

1405
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:43,220
it's kind of a rough change from the 
last one.

1406
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:46,730
Um,
I guess one of my favorite moments,

1407
01:12:46,731 --> 01:12:49,430
I don't know if it's like favorite,
it's weird to describe it,

1408
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:53,300
but having a total biscuit on the show 
and um,

1409
01:12:53,301 --> 01:12:58,301
later that year he passed away.
So that was just a surreal,

1410
01:13:00,321 --> 01:13:01,154
I guess,
experienced have here and they talked 

1411
01:13:03,621 --> 01:13:04,454
about cancer and yet having him on here,
I'm so thankful that we had the 

1412
01:13:09,411 --> 01:13:13,790
opportunity to have him on the uh,
so on the show when we did.

1413
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:16,880
Seriously.
So here's the little excerpt that,

1414
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:17,750
uh,
from,

1415
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,750
from him talking about living with stage
four cancer,

1416
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:23,090
let's make sure at that time counts for 
something.

1417
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:26,870
A lot of it is also,
you assume at this age you've got,

1418
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,580
wow,
I've got 50,

1419
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:31,190
60 years with the family.
What if you didn't?

1420
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,860
While we know you don't know how long 
you've got,

1421
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:34,813
so you know,
make me want to try and be a better dad 

1422
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:40,760
was not out about that.
I wanted to connect more with my stepson

1423
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,710
and then I have and I've been doing 
that.

1424
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:46,010
I want to connect more with my wife,
make sure that we get a good to,

1425
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:47,810
you know,
we get go to run out of it.

1426
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:48,913
I intended to be around when I'm fucking
100 years old will be still bitching 

1427
01:13:51,981 --> 01:13:52,814
about video games if I can be,
but sometimes that might be something 

1428
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:58,350
outside of my control it,
you know,

1429
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:59,203
maybe fighting isn't enough.
Maybe that's just not enough to keep 

1430
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:03,854
going,
but if that's the case then you've got 

1431
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:08,630
to make sure that you spend the time 
you've got in the best way you can.

1432
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:12,040
And even then it's not like it changes 
you overnight.

1433
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,680
Like you still want to go read reddit 
comments.

1434
01:14:13,681 --> 01:14:15,830
You still want to go that shit.
People on twitter,

1435
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:17,560
like you can't change the habit of a 
lifetime,

1436
01:14:17,561 --> 01:14:18,394
but there's something in the back of 
your mind that they have something bad 

1437
01:14:21,281 --> 01:14:22,820
to do.
You know,

1438
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:25,330
maybe that,
that does change over time.

1439
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:26,164
I think.

1440
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,033
Well and some burly,
he did pass away I think like five or 

1441
01:14:33,891 --> 01:14:38,540
six months or maybe even less.
It really shocked me.

1442
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:40,580
I just,
I mean he seemed.

1443
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:41,443
I mean,
I know he was in pain and he was on 

1444
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:44,890
chemo and you see,
he was very,

1445
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:47,360
he was very optimistic guy.
He was a fighter.

1446
01:14:47,361 --> 01:14:49,310
Yeah.
That's the thing about this disease,

1447
01:14:49,311 --> 01:14:50,144
you,
it doesn't show like you don't use the 

1448
01:14:52,011 --> 01:14:53,470
person looks the same.
Right.

1449
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,770
So you just don't see the decline in 
their status.

1450
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,830
And it was the same with my dad up until
the last moment.

1451
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:02,960
He looked healthy,
like it looked fine.

1452
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:05,300
I didn't even lose his hair and nothing 
will look the same.

1453
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:08,540
Yeah.
So it's shocking when it happens,

1454
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:11,310
but I,
uh,

1455
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:13,910
thought it would be cool to remember him
did.

1456
01:15:13,911 --> 01:15:15,430
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1457
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,360
I had watched him all growing up.
I mean,

1458
01:15:18,361 --> 01:15:22,220
like he was the starcraft guy and I was,
I played a ton of starcraft growing up,

1459
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:25,880
uh,
and so that was surreal to even have him

1460
01:15:25,881 --> 01:15:26,714
in there at all.
And then to hear him talking about his 

1461
01:15:29,841 --> 01:15:32,840
disease like that and so openly and with
so much optimism.

1462
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:33,683
It was,
that was,

1463
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,160
that was a special one.
That was cool.

1464
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:37,461
Yeah.
I cherish that.

1465
01:15:37,461 --> 01:15:41,180
I look at the picture of us on the wall 
like somewhat regularly.

1466
01:15:41,181 --> 01:15:42,014
Yeah.

1467
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:44,493
And so last year,
what I remember from that interview was 

1468
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:49,360
he kept saying like,
you know,

1469
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,513
five of my days are bad and two of them 
are good and that's enough for me to 

1470
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,193
comment.

1471
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:58,423
[inaudible]

1472
01:15:58,910 --> 01:15:59,743
yeah.
He left a hole in the gaming community 

1473
01:16:02,511 --> 01:16:03,830
too.
That hasn't really been filled.

1474
01:16:03,831 --> 01:16:07,270
I feel like it's such a unique voice.
Yeah,

1475
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,700
that is definitely true.
Um,

1476
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:15,060
well God bless him.
[inaudible] Hammond,

1477
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:17,250
Carl Jackson,
which was data.

1478
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:20,450
Oh my God,
that's so fucking heartbreaking.

1479
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:23,503
All happened at the same year.
I don't think we've ever talked about 

1480
01:16:26,121 --> 01:16:28,380
Carl did.
We have,

1481
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:33,140
we may have mentioned it.
He was a fan who,

1482
01:16:33,141 --> 01:16:33,974
uh,
had a rare type of cancer that ate fat 

1483
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:39,830
cells in your body.
Super Rare.

1484
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,340
So there's very little research about 
how to cure it.

1485
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:46,640
Right.
And he actually was a,

1486
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,220
was a,
I would say,

1487
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:53,380
a little chunky,
like originally before he had cancer,

1488
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:57,950
kind of a larger guy.
And by the time I met him,

1489
01:16:57,951 --> 01:17:00,470
he,
I mean he looked like,

1490
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,273
um,

1491
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,600
like anorexic.
Wow.

1492
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:11,890
And so he had awful rare form of cancer 
that was just eating all this,

1493
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,530
a fat cells away until he just perished 
from,

1494
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:17,103
just wasted away.
But he wrote us an email and we reached 

1495
01:17:20,151 --> 01:17:20,984
out and we sent them gifts.
He was a huge fan of teddy fresh and 

1496
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:24,854
like he was a big fan of ours and I had 
played pub g with him a couple of times 

1497
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:34,160
and we kept in regular contact and he 
was such a sweet fucking dude.

1498
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:36,980
He was such a sweet dude.
Is such a great outlook,

1499
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:40,040
you know.
And I hadn't talked to him for.

1500
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:41,160
Oh yeah.
And he went to like,

1501
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:42,013
his only dream was to go to Disneyland 
and he had this big a make a wish 

1502
01:17:45,831 --> 01:17:46,664
foundation seminar to Disney.
And we sent them like 500 bucks or 

1503
01:17:49,521 --> 01:17:52,250
something for spending money because 
this fan,

1504
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:53,630
he would have like a single mom.

1505
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,760
There were,
it was like the saddest shit ever.

1506
01:17:55,761 --> 01:17:56,594
His Dad wasn't in the picture.
So just two weeks go by and I haven't 

1507
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:04,790
uh,
talked to him.

1508
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,193
And then someone,
another youtuber who was in touch with 

1509
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:12,980
him just sent me like a dam or something
like,

1510
01:18:12,981 --> 01:18:13,814
Hey,
I just want to let you know in case you 

1511
01:18:14,901 --> 01:18:18,590
didn't hear that Carl passed away.
I was like,

1512
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:20,240
damn,
it's so tragic.

1513
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:23,150
He was like 18 years old.
God,

1514
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:25,820
are you looking for a picture?
I'm trying to send it here.

1515
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:30,850
If you go through the email [inaudible] 
ethan is twitter.

1516
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:33,103
Oh,
there you go.

1517
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,880
Oh yeah,
this is,

1518
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,650
this is.
Yeah.

1519
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:37,484
He was active on twitter and he was 
really loving because people started 

1520
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:46,360
following them on twitter and he was 
getting some really positive support and

1521
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:49,010
attention.
I mean,

1522
01:18:49,011 --> 01:18:53,570
you can see how [inaudible] health then 
he had become.

1523
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:58,940
And um,
one day he just stops or a fat cells

1524
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,930
that I've never heard of that.
I mean,

1525
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,690
I guess you said it's super rare.
Super Rare.

1526
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:03,530
That's crazy.

1527
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:07,700
Uh Huh.
And one day he just,

1528
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:12,090
his twitter stopped.
And when was that?

1529
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,090
That was,
that I see is mom tweeted something.

1530
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:16,613
I didn't see that.
I think this was the last thing I've 

1531
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:19,883
ever seen was him being like,
I totally didn't preorder this because 

1532
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:26,580
they have been super hand play.
Yeah.

1533
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:29,280
He was a sweet kid,
man.

1534
01:19:29,281 --> 01:19:34,281
He was a fucking real sweet dude.
Not a part of the podcast,

1535
01:19:35,341 --> 01:19:39,450
but something that definitely we 
experienced.

1536
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,700
Sure.
But either you do have.

1537
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:44,310
Oh,
you just have the worst snow.

1538
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:46,373
So what's your worst?
How do you thought that very optimistic 

1539
01:19:51,531 --> 01:19:56,090
person today though?
Maybe I.

1540
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:56,923
Okay.
So the worst one was actually when I 

1541
01:19:58,401 --> 01:20:00,280
went to Israel.
All right.

1542
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:03,020
This actually works out because your 
worst is actually pretty fun.

1543
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:08,040
Um,
I went to Israel twice when my dad

1544
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,873
wasn't feeling well,
but the first time a stayed and Kinda 

1545
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,043
fucked it up on the podcast.
So getting drunk and talking shit guys 

1546
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:25,560
that it shouldn't have.
And um,

1547
01:20:25,561 --> 01:20:29,130
so then I rescheduled that.
I will call in from Israel.

1548
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:32,250
So that's the moment.

1549
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:34,493
Hello.

1550
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:42,650
Well it's up to you.
Didn't,

1551
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:44,070
you don't know anything about this,
right?

1552
01:20:44,071 --> 01:20:45,780
You didn't,
you're not updated on all this.

1553
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,600
Then I left for one day for one day.
Everything is ruined.

1554
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,830
Lives is not my fault.
It's your fault.

1555
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:00,563
You know what's going to happen.
You think that I can handle myself 

1556
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:03,870
without a carer.
You leave me in here.

1557
01:21:03,871 --> 01:21:05,340
I can't.
I can't deal with this.

1558
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:07,990
You leave me in a room with Eric and 
jacket.

1559
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:08,873
Two bottles of Hennessy idea.
Was that how many pizza slices did you 

1560
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:16,840
have?
A lot,

1561
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:21,850
dude.
That's all I was upset about it.

1562
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:30,230
You just lose that weight even though 
I'm sorry for smoking by the way.

1563
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:33,010
I'm not smoking anymore.
I'm done.

1564
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:33,993
That's the last cigarette.
You'll see me smoke on this podcast or 

1565
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:36,813
on the street.

1566
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:39,003
Not entirely true,
but I think I've had like three 

1567
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:43,310
cigarettes since then.
Okay.

1568
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:46,530
Yeah,
that's very good.

1569
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:47,663
So

1570
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,610
anyway,
did you.

1571
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:51,444
Were you listening

1572
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:52,230
there?
Yeah,

1573
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:53,063
it was great.
That was actually a great way to break 

1574
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:57,690
the.
Well,

1575
01:21:57,691 --> 01:22:00,270
there you have it.
Isla is best and worst.

1576
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,313
I'm very nice.
Now up next we've got Dan and Ian here 

1577
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:06,870
with the.
Let me see here.

1578
01:22:06,871 --> 01:22:10,880
We've got the.
Whereas this estrone worse.

1579
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,780
Dan,
why don't we change spots?

1580
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:15,050
That'll be.
That'll be better than has a few.

1581
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:20,880
Let me go down to your spot.
So we all have best sim worse now,

1582
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:22,020
Dan,
here you go.

1583
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,280
There might've been some overlap but I 
don't think so.

1584
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:28,670
I don't think there is.
Alright.

1585
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:32,280
So um,
alright.

1586
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:33,450
So yeah,
this is great.

1587
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:34,320
This,
uh,

1588
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,153
this first one,
this was really shortly after coming to 

1589
01:22:39,901 --> 01:22:40,734
work with you guys.
I want to say it was maybe the second 

1590
01:22:42,781 --> 01:22:46,140
episode that I ever did,
um,

1591
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:50,920
which was such a treat because it was 
the episode we did with the CFO,

1592
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:52,290
which,
you know,

1593
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:55,620
I'd like legend.
I had grown up watching jackass.

1594
01:22:55,621 --> 01:22:57,390
I love that shit.
And um,

1595
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,390
and you know,
a week into this Gig,

1596
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:01,410
you know,
getting into,

1597
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,720
hanging out with Steve all day.
It was like this is pretty cool.

1598
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,333
And so back then we did the ad reads 
live and I can't believe we ever did 

1599
01:23:11,621 --> 01:23:12,970
that crazy.
Uh,

1600
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:15,040
so they did the ads live and then,
you know,

1601
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:19,270
you guys wanted to take a break to use 
the restroom and he was like,

1602
01:23:19,271 --> 01:23:19,870
oh,
I'm good.

1603
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:20,680
And it's like,
well,

1604
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,620
you know,
you can hang out and I think we had like

1605
01:23:23,621 --> 01:23:25,930
an ipad or something with the twitch 
chat going.

1606
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:27,910
And so,
uh,

1607
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:30,250
he saw somebody in the twitch chat say,
Hey,

1608
01:23:30,251 --> 01:23:30,850
what's,
uh,

1609
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:35,500
what's your craziest drug story?
And immediately he launches into fucking

1610
01:23:35,501 --> 01:23:38,680
wild story about a time at like,
cause you know,

1611
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:40,330
he's clean now.
He doesn't do any of this,

1612
01:23:40,331 --> 01:23:41,360
but he was just,
you know,

1613
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:45,070
this was maybe 10 years prior.
I don't think I ever watched this back.

1614
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:47,500
Oh,
well this is my first time.

1615
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:50,410
I actually have it timestamped to the 
moment.

1616
01:23:50,411 --> 01:23:52,780
You guys walked back in.
Here we go here.

1617
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:53,643
The whole story.
Yeah.

1618
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:55,150
That's fucking watch.
I've never watched it.

1619
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:57,280
It's our own content for Christ sake.

1620
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,560
Yes.
Since you're my best drug story.

1621
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,110
Oh my God,
I can't.

1622
01:24:01,111 --> 01:24:02,230
I tell,
I'll tell you,

1623
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:05,260
my God fucked up.

1624
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:06,650
He's alone in the room.
You know,

1625
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,430
I thought about asking him that 
question,

1626
01:24:08,431 --> 01:24:10,800
but I was like,
should we get set all the time?

1627
01:24:10,801 --> 01:24:11,510
You know,
but

1628
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:14,330
I was reading that it just wasn't 
fucking funny.

1629
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:19,970
I'm going to shut this door now.
What a professional.

1630
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:21,003
Yeah,
I know was so helplessly addicted to 

1631
01:24:23,301 --> 01:24:24,800
cocaine.
It was insane.

1632
01:24:24,801 --> 01:24:28,790
Like if I ran out,
I would call this drug dealer.

1633
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,220
And uh,
I was waiting for a call from him.

1634
01:24:31,221 --> 01:24:32,054
I'd be like,
dude,

1635
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:37,360
using my cell phone as a pillow so that 
when it vibrated,

1636
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:38,950
Meghan would wake up,
be like,

1637
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,070
oh yeah,
and new drugs.

1638
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:41,533
Now if I went to a event,
I caught up the drug dealer and he 

1639
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,073
didn't answer,
I would just fucking show up at his 

1640
01:24:48,201 --> 01:24:49,790
place.
I would just go there.

1641
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,673
And you're like,
ah.

1642
01:24:50,690 --> 01:24:51,880
When I got to his place,
our,

1643
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:52,803
our Ed try the door.
Sometimes it was open and I would just 

1644
01:24:55,011 --> 01:24:58,820
walk in and sometimes it wasn't open and
that was upsetting.

1645
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:01,250
Um,
this guy,

1646
01:25:01,251 --> 01:25:02,084
okay.
This drug dealer wasn't just a drug 

1647
01:25:05,121 --> 01:25:05,360
dealer.

1648
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,940
He was also like a hardcore addict.
And when I can,

1649
01:25:07,941 --> 01:25:11,120
and I'm talking about cocaine,
this guy would inject cocaine.

1650
01:25:11,121 --> 01:25:14,990
He would shoot up and for some reason 
never injected anything.

1651
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:18,350
Yeah.
Some reason that I just don't understand

1652
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:23,650
about people who shoot up cocaine is 
that with their syringe,

1653
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,430
they scored their own blood all over the
planet.

1654
01:25:27,431 --> 01:25:28,264
I mean,
this guy's apartment and it was all 

1655
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,233
like,
I don't think that's normal sativa 

1656
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,750
sealing the furniture this motherfucker 
had to.

1657
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:40,700
His with syringes,
what squirt all over the place.

1658
01:25:40,701 --> 01:25:45,701
Blood I showed up and I would walk in.
I'd find the guy like sitting there with

1659
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:47,003
like literally needles fucking hang out.
I felt like it was hanging out of his 

1660
01:25:50,631 --> 01:25:52,730
neck one time.
You're sitting there and I walked in.

1661
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:53,564
He was like,
oh,

1662
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:55,570
hey,
what's up dude?

1663
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:01,670
What's up bro?
Like a fuck.

1664
01:26:01,671 --> 01:26:03,620
It was gnarly.
And um,

1665
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:04,500
you know,
I didn't.

1666
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,870
Whatever.
I wouldn't judge him.

1667
01:26:05,871 --> 01:26:06,401
I'd be like,
Oh yeah,

1668
01:26:06,401 --> 01:26:07,880
hey man,
I only got to give me some coke.

1669
01:26:07,881 --> 01:26:09,440
I would buy like a bunch,
you know,

1670
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:14,441
like I'm kind of so I can always buy 
like quite a lot and I'm fucking time.

1671
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,900
I showed up at his door was not,
it wasn't,

1672
01:26:20,901 --> 01:26:23,120
it wasn't locked and it was open.
I walked in,

1673
01:26:23,121 --> 01:26:25,310
it wasn't in the living room.
He was in his back bedroom.

1674
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:30,200
It was like a guest house kind of a deal
and it wasn't like an apartment,

1675
01:26:30,201 --> 01:26:31,670
but it was,
it was like a guest house.

1676
01:26:31,671 --> 01:26:35,220
He went through the back of someone's 
driveway and then he was,

1677
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:38,600
he was in the back and I walked in.
So he's in his bedroom,

1678
01:26:38,601 --> 01:26:40,600
in the back and like,
the dude's like,

1679
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:42,660
he wasn't dead obviously,
like,

1680
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:44,960
but he was not responsive,
you know,

1681
01:26:44,961 --> 01:26:45,794
he was so he had been awake for so many 
days that there's no fuck awakened this 

1682
01:26:49,281 --> 01:26:49,760
guy up.

1683
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,450
And he's like,
I'm like trying to wake him up yet and I

1684
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,570
need fucking drugs,
you know,

1685
01:26:53,571 --> 01:26:56,360
like he's using,
there's no getting this guy up.

1686
01:26:56,361 --> 01:26:58,490
So,
so thought man,

1687
01:26:58,491 --> 01:27:00,290
like I just finally was like,
okay,

1688
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:00,950
fuck,
you know,

1689
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:03,140
he's just sleeping so I'm just not going
to get them up.

1690
01:27:03,141 --> 01:27:03,974
So I went myself into his living room to
the table where he would weigh out all 

1691
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:12,050
of his drugs and there was from him 
weighing.

1692
01:27:12,051 --> 01:27:14,630
So this guys sold so much fucking drugs 
that,

1693
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:19,650
that on the table itself,
there was just like a fucking residue of

1694
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:20,683
coke has built up.
And I'm looking at it like I knew that 

1695
01:27:23,121 --> 01:27:26,950
if I took a car that uh,
that I could just,

1696
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:31,670
I could scrape up like the gnarliest 
pile of cocaine.

1697
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,620
And I'm just like,
I'm just going to go.

1698
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:35,000
I want drugs.
I'm just,

1699
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:35,893
fuck,
I'm going to go fucking hell my sub to 

1700
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:37,984
go scrape.

1701
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:41,900
So now I go and I sit down at the table 
where and I'm looking at it,

1702
01:27:41,901 --> 01:27:44,480
there's cookie cookie and all over it.
But like I said,

1703
01:27:44,481 --> 01:27:45,314
the motherfucker squirted his own blood 
everywhere so it's like cooking with 

1704
01:27:50,421 --> 01:27:53,150
blood,
like little bladders,

1705
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:54,620
like thin,
like you know,

1706
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:59,720
and I'm like fuck is a terrible idea.
There's just this is fucking bad.

1707
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:00,913
And I'm like.
And I just start scraping on fucking 

1708
01:28:03,501 --> 01:28:08,501
cooking and like I can like visibly,
like in the pilot I'm scraping like it.

1709
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:13,810
I can see specks of blood on this.
This is how fucking bad.

1710
01:28:14,751 --> 01:28:16,960
I was addicted.
Sad there.

1711
01:28:16,961 --> 01:28:17,794
Like a fucking snorted them 
motherfuckers blood to ask me for my 

1712
01:28:25,191 --> 01:28:26,630
craziest drug story.

1713
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:28,410
That was on my.
I wanted to ask you,

1714
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:30,403
the bad is dry.
I just dropped the CBO is an incredible 

1715
01:28:36,851 --> 01:28:39,520
storyteller.
Sober.

1716
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:42,160
No,
it looks really healthy.

1717
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:46,210
Really healthy and it looks like he was 
reacting to people in the room,

1718
01:28:46,211 --> 01:28:47,044
like making eye contact with me.
You had talked about how he used to see 

1719
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,300
cigarette.
Yeah,

1720
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:57,750
but while I was kept,
that was,

1721
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:01,830
that was like four minutes.

1722
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,750
I never knew I had my mind.
I was always like,

1723
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:09,520
snore,
blood Wimax,

1724
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:11,160
when that whole thing as like,
what's the setup,

1725
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:13,050
would there you have it?
Well,

1726
01:29:13,051 --> 01:29:15,150
I'm glad I didn't realize you guys 
hadn't seen it at all.

1727
01:29:15,151 --> 01:29:16,090
So I'm glad we,
uh,

1728
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,790
we got to review that.
Yeah.

1729
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:19,230
And like you guys,
like I said,

1730
01:29:19,231 --> 01:29:20,064
you had gone out to the bathroom,
so I'm just sitting in that other room 

1731
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:24,810
and my jaw was dropped.
This is telling the story.

1732
01:29:24,811 --> 01:29:26,370
I'm like,
is he fucking for real right now?

1733
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:27,683
So,
uh,

1734
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,120
so that was pretty wonderful.
Launched.

1735
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:34,080
I watched the documentary but steevo 
during those early years.

1736
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:35,580
And he was,
he was wild.

1737
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:37,200
He was not,
not well,

1738
01:29:37,201 --> 01:29:38,230
that was all serious.
Yeah.

1739
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:41,190
Oh yeah.
I don't doubt that at all.

1740
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:43,381
Yeah.
So,

1741
01:29:43,381 --> 01:29:45,800
um,
so that was definitely a,

1742
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:48,210
a great early memory of working with.
Yeah,

1743
01:29:48,211 --> 01:29:50,100
that was episode 12,
the podcast,

1744
01:29:50,101 --> 01:29:52,580
and I think I had come in on 11 so that,
you know,

1745
01:29:52,581 --> 01:29:53,414
that was my second episode.
Went from Joey Salads to having stable 

1746
01:29:56,270 --> 01:30:01,270
on the one end to the other right there.
So then actually my next uh,

1747
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,670
was,
was also the Martin Shkreli thing.

1748
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,140
Um,
so we've already,

1749
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:09,060
we've already gone down that rabbit hole
a little bit.

1750
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,430
Uh,
what else do we got here?

1751
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:13,570
Um,
all right.

1752
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:14,880
This is,
don't,

1753
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:19,910
don't judge me is a little corny,
but this is not one of my favorites.

1754
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:21,320
Yeah.
So the podcast,

1755
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:26,300
I've got a little announcement,
not really an announcement,

1756
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,790
just something I wanted to talk about 
and just to give some context.

1757
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:32,490
You guys didn't tell us either like 
something was up,

1758
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,350
but this,
I,

1759
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:35,930
I found out the same time as all of you.
So,

1760
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:37,790
uh,
so this was a pretty special moment,

1761
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:41,480
but it may be that.
And also the delivery is hilarious.

1762
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:46,850
There's a new thing of the thickening 
was going to be thickening up here soon.

1763
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:48,163
What does that mean?
What I'm trying to say is that Isla 

1764
01:30:50,751 --> 01:30:51,584
won't be drinking alcohol.
So if she's responsible what I'm trying 

1765
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:01,320
to say.
Podcast extra.

1766
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:07,310
Oh,
how long was that going?

1767
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:08,871
Oh,
it just started,

1768
01:31:08,871 --> 01:31:13,520
like you turned it off immediately.
Flashed red,

1769
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:16,160
they're like,
no,

1770
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:20,720
he lives.
There's two stripes.

1771
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:28,210
She's cooking something up.
It's a cinnamon roll with Ross Standard.

1772
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:32,733
Isla.
It's weird.

1773
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:34,383
She's 11.
I think we literally found out the day 

1774
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:49,840
we couldn't keep it.
Well it's,

1775
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:54,290
we,
we don't know yet if anything's gonna go

1776
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:56,540
wrong.
She's pregnant.

1777
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,600
So I just say,
you know,

1778
01:31:58,700 --> 01:31:59,533
because

1779
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:04,040
that's very sweet of you Dan.
That genuinely was.

1780
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,010
That was the specialists are warming.
Yeah.

1781
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:09,730
Well she is.
The thickening has happened.

1782
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,140
Can you show like over just do like a 
tight,

1783
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:16,460
like make your shirt tight.
Oh,

1784
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:17,403
look at the camera.
Let me see what we can see it on the 

1785
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:21,491
wall.
It's hard to tell,

1786
01:32:21,491 --> 01:32:22,324
but when there was a bomb,
it's funny because you're like halfway 

1787
01:32:25,721 --> 01:32:26,554
through and you.
I mean these next four months are going 

1788
01:32:28,121 --> 01:32:32,130
to go fast.
Exhilarates celebrate from here on out.

1789
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:32,771
Yeah.
No,

1790
01:32:32,771 --> 01:32:33,604
but I was sought isla the other day when
she was getting dressed or like just 

1791
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:39,070
yesterday and as she's putting a shirt 
on,

1792
01:32:39,071 --> 01:32:40,060
I'm like,
Holy Shit,

1793
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:42,640
there's a baby in there.
Yeah,

1794
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:44,860
no,
it's weird.

1795
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:46,123
Yeah,
that's great.

1796
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:46,940
And then,
uh,

1797
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,880
this I'll make,
I had a few more,

1798
01:32:48,881 --> 01:32:52,240
but I'll make this my last of my 
favorite.

1799
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,850
Um,
this is to this day,

1800
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,520
my favorite line that's ever been 
uttered on this podcast.

1801
01:32:58,630 --> 01:33:00,190
I don't think it'll ever be topped,
honestly.

1802
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:02,350
I'm curious.
What is it?

1803
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,490
So 39 with post Malone looks so 
exhausting.

1804
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,290
It is.
I looked like shit.

1805
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:13,240
Now you look in the.
You're killing it,

1806
01:33:13,241 --> 01:33:14,780
bro.
I love that.

1807
01:33:14,781 --> 01:33:17,440
You just.
The great thing is that you just embrace

1808
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:19,810
your authentic dude.
You're who you are.

1809
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,750
Like you just fucking.
You're killing it,

1810
01:33:22,751 --> 01:33:23,890
bro.
I'm just a guy.

1811
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:26,860
Exactly.
Just to kind of beautiful blue eyes.

1812
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:27,893
Right?
I guess that means you are more than 

1813
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:33,790
just a gun because I didn't have that.
I'm really just the guy.

1814
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:38,320
Your eyes look like hamburgers.
Yeah.

1815
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:41,380
That is amazing.
That's so fucking funny.

1816
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:45,770
But I think of that regular.
That's a very original line.

1817
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:52,200
And they do export village.
Your eyes are like blueberry and want to

1818
01:33:52,301 --> 01:33:53,134
eat them.

1819
01:33:55,110 --> 01:34:00,110
That Tom Petty Song write a brown eyed 
girl than Morrison.

1820
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:01,760
Van Morrison.
Marsha,

1821
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,660
that was quick.
I'm right on that.

1822
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:08,500
But famously a post malone as a new 
track coming out on his new album called

1823
01:34:08,501 --> 01:34:11,940
hamburger.
I'd about me.

1824
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:14,590
That's awesome.
Congrats.

1825
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,731
Um,
okay.

1826
01:34:15,731 --> 01:34:16,780
And then,
uh,

1827
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:21,310
and then I just have one worst moment 
that I need to put up there.

1828
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:24,900
I'm legitimately still have nightmares 
about this.

1829
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:26,560
Occasionally.
That's not a joke.

1830
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:32,590
I'll have like stress nightmares about 
work and we are streaming.

1831
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:34,883
God,
this was our first on youtube on 

1832
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:40,843
youtube.
Come over and see what it feels like 

1833
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:47,290
because we've never actually watched 
from the show.

1834
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:52,300
And so I thought it'd be a fun 
experience to see that one point.

1835
01:34:54,251 --> 01:34:57,890
2 million views on today's episode.
I can't believe people watch this.

1836
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:01,780
It keeps me going for like over a 
minute.

1837
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:02,803
Isla,
you are looking good and Dan is 

1838
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,590
screaming at the end.
I can't hear him on twitch.

1839
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:21,090
You can do appreciate working here.
And then I know I'm in this little minor

1840
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:30,770
escape that I never want to know.
What happened,

1841
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:32,540
which made this so great,

1842
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:35,960
is that it was our first live episode on
Youtube,

1843
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:38,810
which means that because we were live 
streaming on twitch,

1844
01:35:38,811 --> 01:35:41,660
so if we had a mistake like this,
we could just start over.

1845
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:43,130
Right.
And then cut it up.

1846
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:44,533
So this was the first time that it was 
like when you got to actually nail this 

1847
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:49,350
live and I think part of it too is that,
you know,

1848
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:53,000
I usually double check all the computers
and would check for this kind of stuff,

1849
01:35:53,001 --> 01:35:56,000
but because it was the first time on 
Youtube I had a million new,

1850
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:56,893
like it wasn't routine,
like it was the first day of the new 

1851
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:00,044
setup and so my mind was a million 
places and didn't see that you had 

1852
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:07,310
stream open.
Whoops.

1853
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:08,840
Hey look,
we got one point,

1854
01:36:08,841 --> 01:36:09,930
2 million views.
Yeah,

1855
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:10,773
I guess it's worked out.
Somehow people powered through that 

1856
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:13,453
makes me feel better.
At one point 2 million people have seen 

1857
01:36:16,071 --> 01:36:20,150
me feel better.
I give to hard on yourself then.

1858
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:21,620
Yeah.
Well you know,

1859
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:26,480
you.
Especially if you have an anxiety attack

1860
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,700
on camera.
Yeah,

1861
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,500
exactly.
It wasn't a disaster.

1862
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:35,450
It sounds like an anxiety attack.
Then after that episode we go and we see

1863
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:36,590
how bad is it?
Like,

1864
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:37,130
oh,
we're like,

1865
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:38,150
oh,
how bad could it be?

1866
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:43,640
And it keeps going and it keeps going.
You guys,

1867
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,310
when I told you I was,
you were like,

1868
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:48,740
you know,
after the episode it was like,

1869
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:49,610
hello,
how bad is it?

1870
01:36:49,611 --> 01:36:54,090
And it was like pretty bad.
Well,

1871
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:57,050
it's fun.
It's funny in retrospect as to I guess,

1872
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:58,640
but um,
but yeah,

1873
01:36:58,641 --> 01:36:59,474
I mean I'll,
I'll sometimes have like just this past 

1874
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,020
week.
Yeah,

1875
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:04,700
it was the night before the charity 
stream.

1876
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:06,440
Not,
I didn't dream about that,

1877
01:37:06,441 --> 01:37:07,274
but I had a dream that our audio board,
all the settings got erased like five 

1878
01:37:10,581 --> 01:37:11,414
minutes at a horse show,
which anybody that's done audio would 

1879
01:37:14,181 --> 01:37:16,250
know that that's like,
you know,

1880
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:20,270
two hours of reset that would need to 
happen.

1881
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:24,080
And so I'm glad to know you're having 
nightmares about what it means.

1882
01:37:24,081 --> 01:37:29,081
You really care.
I do the next day or whatever.

1883
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:34,070
Naked.
So cherished memories,

1884
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,350
cherished memories and not so cherished 
memories.

1885
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:37,860
So yeah,
so that was,

1886
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:39,160
that was my lineup and we got.

1887
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:44,350
We got him in here.
Why don't you guys switch seats?

1888
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:46,010
I left my soda and the other room.

1889
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:51,610
Oh sure.
This is not so many Saudis.

1890
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:58,410
Saudi paps could.
Oh,

1891
01:37:58,411 --> 01:37:59,221
I see where it is.
Yeah,

1892
01:37:59,221 --> 01:38:00,360
you should just be the list.
Right.

1893
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:02,123
Gotcha.

1894
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:13,310
Dead Air.
So this one was Dan.

1895
01:38:16,481 --> 01:38:19,150
Let's listen to it.
Early on when I started working here.

1896
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:24,250
And this moment I think took us all 
caught us all by surprise.

1897
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:27,880
Bradbury showed up.
Wait,

1898
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:30,310
hold on.
What is this clip?

1899
01:38:30,311 --> 01:38:33,370
But only it's 2000 views.
This is way early on the channel.

1900
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:36,660
The highlight channels.
One of the first no videos,

1901
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:39,070
that highlight channel is going to be 
the lowest by the way.

1902
01:38:39,071 --> 01:38:40,930
Highlight channel.
Just hit a million subscribers.

1903
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,553
That is so cool because we all created 
that highlight channel together less 

1904
01:38:50,111 --> 01:38:54,290
than a year ago because people were 
stealing our clips and posting it,

1905
01:38:54,291 --> 01:38:55,660
sort of like what the hell we should do 
it.

1906
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,530
Right.
And uh,

1907
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:58,593
the explosion there has been phenomenal 
and it's so cool that we've all built 

1908
01:39:02,351 --> 01:39:03,184
that together.
You guys were all here from the 

1909
01:39:05,261 --> 01:39:09,850
inception of that channel,
actually cut it,

1910
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:14,580
cut the highlights and low 75 percent.
Again,

1911
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:16,383
a lot of credit there.
He is the highlight king and I handled 

1912
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:24,600
some of the slick thumbnails now.
The thumbnails had been fired lately.

1913
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:27,280
Our thumbnail game has been improving.
Yeah,

1914
01:39:27,281 --> 01:39:30,940
you guys got acquired talent.
You're getting better and better at it,

1915
01:39:31,850 --> 01:39:36,650
but that's our fourth million 
subscribed.

1916
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:38,540
Right?
Pretty soon.

1917
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:40,970
Another button now the button can pawn 
off.

1918
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:44,783
What were you going to say?
And we did a toast that I feel like I 

1919
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:48,393
peaked a little bit ago with Papa John 
Shooting Papa John in the back of the 

1920
01:39:51,701 --> 01:39:54,460
head.
I don't know if that was ever done.

1921
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:55,720
Was really something.
Yeah,

1922
01:39:55,721 --> 01:39:56,920
exactly.
Oh,

1923
01:39:56,921 --> 01:39:58,360
we testing.
Are we doing this?

1924
01:39:58,361 --> 01:40:00,070
Should we test one?
Ian's done.

1925
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:00,910
We can.
Well,

1926
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:03,340
let's,
let's enjoy some orange soda while you,

1927
01:40:03,341 --> 01:40:06,940
uh,
I don't want because you mentioned that.

1928
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:10,780
So as Ian Discusses his,
um,

1929
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:16,480
is a best and worst we shall enjoy.
Is this crystal what year?

1930
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:19,800
Vintage?
A few thousand dollars.

1931
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:22,720
Because I don't know who drinks orange 
soda.

1932
01:40:22,721 --> 01:40:26,680
It's probably been sitting on the shelf 
for about that long rosé right?

1933
01:40:26,681 --> 01:40:28,070
Or is this your style?
Rosacea?

1934
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:33,050
This is a.
What is this?

1935
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:33,923
Squirt Fanta.
Nice Fruity Aroma and picking me up 

1936
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:41,650
here.
Go ahead and give you drink.

1937
01:40:42,490 --> 01:40:44,620
You can have a little of that since you 
are pregnant,

1938
01:40:44,621 --> 01:40:48,460
but not too much.
That's probably true about soda.

1939
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:49,363
They're like,
don't drink that shit if you're 

1940
01:40:49,721 --> 01:40:51,670
pregnant.
Got To let it open up.

1941
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:52,600
Yeah,
let it.

1942
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,980
Let it.
Let it air out a little bit.

1943
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:58,410
I want to dive right in to that.
Cheers guys to 1 million on the.

1944
01:40:58,960 --> 01:40:59,890
On the.
On the highlights,

1945
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:03,160
highlights and so a greater first 100 
episodes together.

1946
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:04,053
Yes indeed.
And thank you to all the viewers and 

1947
01:41:06,341 --> 01:41:07,174
listeners.
I think that turned really tastes 

1948
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,123
fucking online.

1949
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,440
Does Sarah and Zach has a cup in the 
back?

1950
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:21,340
Are you guys doing this?
We did a little backstage.

1951
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:27,790
Was Sara.
Cheers guys.

1952
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,150
Look great to year to a great 
celebration of,

1953
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:32,853
you know,
there's six people here that I really 

1954
01:41:33,911 --> 01:41:36,320
like.
I guess that includes five.

1955
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:40,080
I'll let you decide.
Count like,

1956
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:42,160
wait who?
But who's left down by?

1957
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,470
Not including myself.
Oh,

1958
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:46,120
okay.
Office.

1959
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,980
Wait.
Why are we confused about.

1960
01:41:47,981 --> 01:41:49,300
No,
we're not going to send it,

1961
01:41:49,301 --> 01:41:50,170
right?
Yeah.

1962
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:51,860
Six.
Okay.

1963
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:57,570
If you had said you had said the wrong 
number and then left us includes you.

1964
01:41:58,430 --> 01:42:00,310
Right?
It's weird to say,

1965
01:42:00,311 --> 01:42:02,050
I really like.
I didn't mean to say that.

1966
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:06,370
Do people really like themselves?
I don't love yourself.

1967
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:08,440
I know people say that.
Yeah.

1968
01:42:08,450 --> 01:42:10,850
I mean nobody.
It's weird to be like say,

1969
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,580
okay.
Regardless.

1970
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,520
He hit us,
hit us with them names.

1971
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:19,833
I remember we were all panicking on this
one because we had no idea what was 

1972
01:42:24,341 --> 01:42:25,390
going to walk through the door.

1973
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,233
If Ethan Bradbury,
we're going to just be like completely 

1974
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:30,063
quiet.
They're going to engage and then they 

1975
01:42:32,861 --> 01:42:33,694
turned out to be just absolute legends.
There's a little back story actually 

1976
01:42:38,681 --> 01:42:43,681
because we didn't know what to expect.
And um,

1977
01:42:44,110 --> 01:42:46,480
somebody rolled outside to greet them.
Was it un?

1978
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:47,770
Uh,
it wasn't me.

1979
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:50,710
I think we saw out the window actually,
isn't it?

1980
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:53,020
I don't think you could see where 
somebody went outside.

1981
01:42:53,021 --> 01:42:54,670
I think,
and maybe it was me,

1982
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:56,290
it was me.
It was definitely me.

1983
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,513
I went out to go meet them and I saw 
them in the parking lot putting on the 

1984
01:43:00,410 --> 01:43:03,340
spiderman that's and I was like,
oh my God.

1985
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:08,200
I came inside and I was like,
oh my God,

1986
01:43:08,201 --> 01:43:10,680
you guys are going to remember this?
Oh yeah.

1987
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:15,750
I remember like we bought donuts before 
and make it their own.

1988
01:43:15,870 --> 01:43:16,820
They were,
they were.

1989
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:20,080
They knew what was up.
They came to play,

1990
01:43:20,081 --> 01:43:24,220
so we rolled out the carpet form here.

1991
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:30,490
I think the only guest that ever got the
red carpet treatment,

1992
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:33,610
by the way,
why?

1993
01:43:33,611 --> 01:43:38,560
I love the exact shot into the office or
something,

1994
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:46,273
Kinda played the kids music.
We were all obsessed with ethan trap 

1995
01:43:55,361 --> 01:43:56,810
area as I still am.
Actually.

1996
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:03,390
Shout out to Cole songs,
does his own thing.

1997
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:09,280
I was afraid that I was afraid that 
she's going to lay on the couch and it's

1998
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:13,953
like,
oh shit.

1999
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:17,300
One of the guns come on my mind.
I was like Spidey,

2000
01:44:17,301 --> 01:44:22,301
such a clean up this damn city guys.
That was a good moment.

2001
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,760
Yeah,
that was pretty great.

2002
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:31,810
They were very,
very onboard.

2003
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:33,180
Surprise,
surprise you.

2004
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:34,093
That was the beginning of the turn,
the paradigm shift in the life of Ethan 

2005
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:41,870
Bradbury and Joe and mo Jo Malone 
Bradbury,

2006
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:43,003
because since then they've gotten full 
me mode to get complete extreme and now 

2007
01:44:47,901 --> 01:44:52,520
they comment on every instagram post 
that any of us ever made.

2008
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:55,580
Since that episode.
They will miss a single day.

2009
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:57,500
Don't miss the boats.
They do not miss a post,

2010
01:44:58,070 --> 01:45:00,830
and he always said he ethan wrights 
stuff that doesn't even make sense.

2011
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,440
He'll just go like slamming on 
everything.

2012
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:05,570
It's just,
it's great.

2013
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:06,930
God bless his soul.
You know,

2014
01:45:07,370 --> 01:45:08,780
sometimes.
I mean,

2015
01:45:08,781 --> 01:45:11,060
I remember when you made the 
announcement,

2016
01:45:11,090 --> 01:45:13,260
he actually was pretty sweet with his 
comment.

2017
01:45:13,261 --> 01:45:14,600
That's true.
Yeah.

2018
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:17,360
What did he say?
It was just congratulating.

2019
01:45:17,361 --> 01:45:19,520
You seem very real.
Congratulations.

2020
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:24,730
There wasn't a slamming.
Slamming me.

2021
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:27,580
We've got the profit.
Yeah.

2022
01:45:27,581 --> 01:45:32,581
This was when a doctor showed up,
looked so good.

2023
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:36,440
Professor prophecies.
Got To make a comeback.

2024
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:38,653
So this is when you introduced the Doc.
He's someone who I respect and 

2025
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:43,874
appreciate and I'm also going to take 
them out three times and I'm the prof 

2026
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:52,010
and I'm here to profit the end of the 
dark.

2027
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:52,963
Dan Bring this coward,
coward in county through is to look at 

2028
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:06,290
this coward.
How have a seat,

2029
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:10,200
because I'm the three times three time 
world champ.

2030
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:12,590
90 seven 98.

2031
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:18,600
He's so fucking tall.
Three time,

2032
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:19,640
dude.
Yeah,

2033
01:46:19,670 --> 01:46:21,400
minecraft casual gaming.
Okay.

2034
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:24,830
First of all,
I have a castle in minecraft.

2035
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:27,380
If my bullies didn't come into my server
and tearing down,

2036
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:28,393
you wouldn't be in an off.
I replicated the TNG enterprise in 

2037
01:46:31,521 --> 01:46:33,200
minecraft and you're going to shit on 
that.

2038
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:34,213
That's why they call me the three times 
I did bring you some collector item tee 

2039
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:38,860
shirts and I don't know if I even want 
to him to you.

2040
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:44,510
Now you've got a fat girl,
a girl.

2041
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,770
Take a look at.
Take a look at it.

2042
01:46:49,771 --> 01:46:50,720
Frankly.
I can't see you.

2043
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:52,080
I'm to.
I'm going to put these down.

2044
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:57,260
You can't see it in the Google prototype
scopes with originally got here.

2045
01:46:59,570 --> 01:47:02,520
That was good.
That was really fun.

2046
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:03,660
Yeah,
that was just a fun.

2047
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:07,020
That was one of my favorite episodes.
I think he was just so entertaining.

2048
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:07,923
I was so nervous about interviewing and 
because he's so deep in character that 

2049
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,340
it was just.

2050
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:15,493
I was afraid was gonna be a minefield of
trying to get him to say anything 

2051
01:47:18,331 --> 01:47:19,810
interesting,
but he actually,

2052
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:20,600
he,
he,

2053
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:23,850
he did great.
I mean he never broke character but,

2054
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:27,690
but he still managed to be kind of real.
The Lens of the character.

2055
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:28,524
It was,
it was good.

2056
01:47:28,570 --> 01:47:29,430
Yeah,
I enjoyed that.

2057
01:47:29,431 --> 01:47:30,264
Yeah.
So,

2058
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:31,753
uh,
so another one that I had was when we 

2059
01:47:33,601 --> 01:47:35,680
had sean,
Sean Evans,

2060
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:40,780
first gotTa chew you gotTa fucking beard
and everything.

2061
01:47:41,410 --> 01:47:43,020
Yeah.
When I saw this I was like,

2062
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,780
oh yeah.
You and Alex were getting creamed in the

2063
01:47:48,781 --> 01:47:50,460
background.
It was,

2064
01:47:50,461 --> 01:47:51,294
it was rough.
I was not anticipating while I was at 

2065
01:47:53,341 --> 01:47:55,740
the time because you now like spicy food
because of this.

2066
01:47:55,741 --> 01:47:56,250
Right.
Look,

2067
01:47:56,250 --> 01:47:58,860
this kinda like broke the seal.
I remember it was,

2068
01:47:58,890 --> 01:47:59,723
we knew this about Ian that he like 
never ate spicy food and then we forced 

2069
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:05,220
like a hot cheeto would knocked me on my
end.

2070
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:06,810
So you know,
this was a big jump,

2071
01:48:06,830 --> 01:48:11,830
but this was so fun because the taste is
kind of pleasant at first.

2072
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:23,610
It feels like I was teabag by Satan.
It looks like you were to back,

2073
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:28,620
let's say,
are you filling out crying?

2074
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:33,240
I was dying back there.
That was rough.

2075
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,353
I was so fun.
That was one of my favorite episodes 

2076
01:48:37,351 --> 01:48:40,410
because we have always been such fans of
hotlines.

2077
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:41,653
And then to get actually got to pick his
brain a little bit on how he interviews 

2078
01:48:45,331 --> 01:48:47,120
people.
Um,

2079
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:48,893
that was actually,
I think the first time I showed my face 

2080
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,750
on the deal,
we had the meme where we never saw your.

2081
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:00,900
Although we didn't really never shut 
like we've shown blown at once before.

2082
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:05,390
I think the.
Or it was made by Joey Salad,

2083
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:09,780
a joey in his blog.
He showed somebody on the subway.

2084
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:12,280
I was such an ancient.
Me.

2085
01:49:12,330 --> 01:49:13,163
I almost don't even remember.
Now you're eating the powerpoint is the 

2086
01:49:17,191 --> 01:49:18,024
pace of the show at this.
Basically we gave everyone had to deal 

2087
01:49:21,601 --> 01:49:25,110
with this,
but yeah,

2088
01:49:25,111 --> 01:49:26,400
I really.
That was great.

2089
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:28,170
Doing a little mini hartland.
Yeah,

2090
01:49:28,171 --> 01:49:33,171
that was cool.
Another I liked when Eric brought on his

2091
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:38,150
conspiracy closet segment broker clip.
Oh yes.

2092
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:39,090
I love,
love.

2093
01:49:39,091 --> 01:49:44,091
Love this real quick.
So keep an eye on now.

2094
01:49:44,861 --> 01:49:46,500
This guy's a clone,
he's about the glitch,

2095
01:49:46,501 --> 01:49:47,380
the fuck out.

2096
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:54,310
A certain amount of distance between the
two on the right might also be clones.

2097
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:57,173
There is a lot.
It's a big day or do the strangest 

2098
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:05,080
things on his.
On the history of what is happening.

2099
01:50:05,150 --> 01:50:10,150
If you could say there's a pretty big 
weight go

2100
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:21,800
because she's like,
and it's such a weird face that it's not

2101
01:50:21,801 --> 01:50:23,930
a natural relaxed look.
Yeah.

2102
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:26,840
It's so weird,
but it does seem like somebody said like

2103
01:50:26,841 --> 01:50:30,070
his trigger word and he went into debug 
mode from them.

2104
01:50:31,050 --> 01:50:33,080
I think the second off,
it's true.

2105
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,100
Oh yeah,
they intro.

2106
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:36,410
This segment is just so great.

2107
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:42,000
No.

2108
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:48,740
Whether we should get another episode 
going of ABC's until.

2109
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:51,480
That would be fun,
man.

2110
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:53,430
Eric is always a blast to avalon.
Yeah,

2111
01:50:53,431 --> 01:50:54,264
he's a great president.
It's time to reboot the conspiracy 

2112
01:50:56,521 --> 01:50:57,370
classes.
Yeah.

2113
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:59,020
I didn't know it meant that much to you,
but,

2114
01:50:59,070 --> 01:50:59,903
but know to this day people constantly,
but I'll see comments like please bring 

2115
01:51:07,591 --> 01:51:08,580
it back.
It was so good.

2116
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:09,480
Yeah,
we should.

2117
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:11,880
I really love how he prepared a segment.
It was,

2118
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:14,860
it really worked.
And uh,

2119
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:17,520
this was the,
another squirelly one,

2120
01:51:17,521 --> 01:51:20,490
but this was just to show the live 
episode we did,

2121
01:51:20,491 --> 01:51:24,750
which I thought was one of the funniest,
most enjoyable ones we've done,

2122
01:51:24,751 --> 01:51:26,400
but also extremely stressful,
you know?

2123
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:27,690
Oh yeah.
You guys,

2124
01:51:28,470 --> 01:51:30,480
you guys in the crew.
I mean that was,

2125
01:51:30,510 --> 01:51:33,540
it took so much work and you guys were 
grinding hard.

2126
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:34,513
It was all of that together.
We had extra because it wasn't just do 

2127
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:38,613
the live show is also streaming it,
recording it all the first time ever 

2128
01:51:42,601 --> 01:51:45,840
doing it out of our studio,
which I've done a lot to promote events.

2129
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,180
So that was my job before I came and 
worked for you guys.

2130
01:51:48,181 --> 01:51:53,010
But it had been awhile and I was used to
working with like a production truck and

2131
01:51:53,011 --> 01:51:53,850
like,
you know,

2132
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,380
and,
but uh,

2133
01:51:55,381 --> 01:51:56,214
but we pulled it off.
Maybe get closely with them on any 

2134
01:51:58,471 --> 01:51:59,310
hitches.
Really.

2135
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:04,370
I will say the projector was a pain in 
the audio was fucking out of it.

2136
01:52:06,370 --> 01:52:07,203
We're kind of Improv.
Why do you guys have a $50 fucking 

2137
01:52:10,801 --> 01:52:15,801
projector?
Just barely got time on the stage to get

2138
01:52:15,961 --> 01:52:19,200
used to it now where before,
but that's all right.

2139
01:52:19,290 --> 01:52:21,740
We got kicked out of the venue.
Yeah.

2140
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:22,853
Yeah.
There were some circumstances that made 

2141
01:52:24,961 --> 01:52:26,040
it.
For the most part,

2142
01:52:26,050 --> 01:52:26,883
it was as smooth as you could hope for.
But Zach was calling in as Jordan the 

2143
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:32,810
fanboy.
Yeah.

2144
01:52:32,810 --> 01:52:35,870
And he was coming the projector.
That's right.

2145
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:37,870
Yes,
very much.

2146
01:52:38,630 --> 01:52:39,960
Now I have nightmares about that one 
too.

2147
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:43,170
I wasn't in control because we tested it
beforehand.

2148
01:52:43,171 --> 01:52:43,890
I don't work.
Yeah,

2149
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:46,410
exactly.
There's only so much you can do a.

2150
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,860
It was a such a fun,
such a fun,

2151
01:52:48,861 --> 01:52:52,010
fun time and so stressful.
It was just too stressful.

2152
01:52:52,011 --> 01:52:53,840
That's what we haven't done it again 
because we were like,

2153
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:55,820
that was amazing and I never want to do 
it again.

2154
01:52:56,410 --> 01:52:58,820
Kind of.
We did one and do it again,

2155
01:52:58,910 --> 01:53:00,050
but we don't want to.
It's.

2156
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:01,253
It's weird.
We even had the idea of doing it once a 

2157
01:53:04,490 --> 01:53:05,040
month.
I don't know.

2158
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,200
Oh my God.
Oh yeah.

2159
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:08,593
Doing it as kind of a residency thing.
I mean if we were maybe something 

2160
01:53:11,391 --> 01:53:12,224
considering the future because if we do 
it regularly then it becomes less of a 

2161
01:53:16,431 --> 01:53:17,264
thing,
you know,

2162
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:18,163
you got a routine on how you do it and 
you get into a rhythm and it's not so 

2163
01:53:20,811 --> 01:53:21,110
bad.

2164
01:53:21,110 --> 01:53:24,080
So maybe someday in the future.
I mean it was so fun.

2165
01:53:24,081 --> 01:53:24,914
It really was fun.
We all went out afterwards this out and 

2166
01:53:27,561 --> 01:53:29,090
like that.
That was super fun.

2167
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:31,370
But the,
the,

2168
01:53:31,530 --> 01:53:33,860
the,
the thing is like in the room that there

2169
01:53:33,861 --> 01:53:37,310
was so much laughter and joy in the room
and everyone,

2170
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:38,173
there were some really great energy,
but when you watch the vod you don't 

2171
01:53:40,341 --> 01:53:41,174
really get to feel that because you 
don't hear the laughs and the crowd as 

2172
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:47,720
much as we did in the room.
Which that was another aspect is we,

2173
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:52,160
the venue did the audio and not that 
they did a terrible job,

2174
01:53:52,161 --> 01:53:55,730
but they didn't necessarily have a 
audience mics.

2175
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:57,160
And so,
you know,

2176
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:00,350
if we were to do it again,
lesson learned like the Mike,

2177
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:01,790
we should,
we should.

2178
01:54:02,030 --> 01:54:04,130
Yeah.
Maybe we'll do another one next year.

2179
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:05,330
It was.
Oh,

2180
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:09,690
and there was a proposal of marriage,
but you know what,

2181
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:11,480
we buy them again.
We went.

2182
01:54:11,570 --> 01:54:14,240
When we did kill Tony,
they were in the audience.

2183
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:14,930
Oh,
no way.

2184
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:16,160
And they came and said Hi.
We're like,

2185
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:19,490
you guys are married now.
That's awesome.

2186
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,790
Yeah.
Trying to find the moment,

2187
01:54:22,791 --> 01:54:25,070
but yeah,
look at this guy is big.

2188
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:27,120
He's bragged.
Judgment just came out with this.

2189
01:54:27,170 --> 01:54:32,170
Damn that audio quality is seven years.
This ties it all together here.

2190
01:54:37,730 --> 01:54:40,670
I suspect if he wasn't such a troll he 
probably would be fine.

2191
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:47,790
Setting it up,
playing a little meme that it's going to

2192
01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:50,690
be nervous.
Post was,

2193
01:54:51,530 --> 01:54:54,830
I know a giant crowds,
but this is a different vibe.

2194
01:54:58,020 --> 01:55:01,320
But you had everybody lift up their cell
phones.

2195
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:04,260
Yeah,
look at that.

2196
01:55:04,290 --> 01:55:07,800
Great.
California kind of these pretty precious

2197
01:55:07,801 --> 01:55:09,430
animals.
That's why we care so much about Bombay.

2198
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:12,260
So we had danny come into actually had 
cam.

2199
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:14,610
Awesome.
Really well shot.

2200
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:18,660
If you could make $100,000,000
to go to jail,

2201
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:22,830
how much time would you do?
Is this related to your situation?

2202
01:55:23,970 --> 01:55:28,470
Totally over a hundred million dollars 
right now.

2203
01:55:28,471 --> 01:55:33,471
I'm looking at a zero to six months,
six months and no fine.

2204
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:35,880
It's so cold.

2205
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:51,650
He lived the same way.
He was locked up,

2206
01:55:51,890 --> 01:55:56,890
meaning you can already lost last 
special round of applause.

2207
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:02,660
Good job.
It was amazing.

2208
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:07,760
You feel so funny because like you have 
such a sympathetic audience,

2209
01:56:11,031 --> 01:56:11,864
right?
And they're there for you and they love 

2210
01:56:13,071 --> 01:56:14,180
you.
So it's like,

2211
01:56:14,490 --> 01:56:15,323
it's the best fucking crowd.
I can only imagine trying to perform 

2212
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:19,670
like the phone.
Oh my God.

2213
01:56:20,210 --> 01:56:21,043
I wish.
I can only imagine trying to do jokes 

2214
01:56:23,121 --> 01:56:27,070
for people who don't know who you are.
Tough game out there.

2215
01:56:27,670 --> 01:56:28,503
Tough game.
I think Sarah and put this one in the 

2216
01:56:31,941 --> 01:56:36,320
best or favorite moments or one of her?
Least favorite.

2217
01:56:36,321 --> 01:56:37,250
Actually,
I'm not sure.

2218
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:39,140
I don't know.
What is the thank you.

2219
01:56:39,141 --> 01:56:41,330
Once again,
a dead mouse.

2220
01:56:41,331 --> 01:56:42,164
George Zimmerman.

2221
01:56:54,370 --> 01:56:56,570
I remember thinking this is why I 
haven't

2222
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,350
straight up name phobia.
That's the.

2223
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:02,930
I had it before that.
When I say people's name,

2224
01:57:02,931 --> 01:57:05,510
I get so stressed that I'm going to say 
the wrong thing.

2225
01:57:05,511 --> 01:57:10,340
I had like a mini panic attack every 
time and I called him George Zimmerman,

2226
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:12,730
George Zimmerman.
But right one,

2227
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:15,610
we were closed and the new album is 
coming out and fucking

2228
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:20,500
George Zimmerman because that's Florida.
Who killed a dude,

2229
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:35,590
man.
That's funny as shit guys.

2230
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:43,950
Got It.
Got It,

2231
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:45,960
got it.
Wow.

2232
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:53,710
Oh Man.
Great entry was one of them.

2233
01:57:57,380 --> 01:58:01,440
One of my worst moments I think.
Wait,

2234
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,020
those are condos.
Yeah.

2235
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:10,040
So you won't go to his listening party 
where his fucking can go anywhere.

2236
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:14,300
Right here.
I got him on stock X.

2237
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:17,880
I love shoes it and that way you can say
it,

2238
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:18,743
but I buy,
I buy the shoes that I really genuinely 

2239
01:58:20,241 --> 01:58:22,590
like.
And are those puffy you have?

2240
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:23,320
Very.
Yeah.

2241
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:24,890
Kanye west shoes or fucking,
you know,

2242
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:25,700
our,
our,

2243
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:27,900
our intern has fake easy song.
Really.

2244
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:34,720
Got It.
I got to tell you,

2245
01:58:34,790 --> 01:58:37,320
I was on the back happened.

2246
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:42,260
He was legitimately crushed.
I felt like I was out.

2247
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:46,940
It took me out of the closet.
I thought it was still new,

2248
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:47,823
like the was.
I thought it was like an interesting 

2249
01:58:51,910 --> 01:58:55,000
point of conversation to note like,
but then I was like,

2250
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:55,863
oh I shouldn't have.
Because I forget that you're so in the 

2251
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:02,110
Kanye community.
Yeah.

2252
01:59:02,660 --> 01:59:04,420
But did you feel betrayed?
I guess so.

2253
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:07,750
I'm always like a rat in the community.
Like I was banned from the floor.

2254
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:11,410
I couldn't get the real.
I'm like screwing around in the walls,

2255
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:15,370
but Kanye fans so you know.
But well okay,

2256
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:17,690
because there is a silver lining to 
that.

2257
01:59:18,410 --> 01:59:21,160
What you're wearing right now as a 
result,

2258
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:26,620
as the outing in Adidas reached out

2259
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:30,210
and hooked in up.
No one else.

2260
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:30,910
No.
No.

2261
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:32,130
So we're all gel.
Actually.

2262
01:59:32,131 --> 01:59:33,630
Let me riff,
let me rephrase.

2263
01:59:33,660 --> 01:59:34,493
They said we want to give you guys the 
eecs who's up first and I said it's got 

2264
01:59:41,801 --> 01:59:42,634
to be.

2265
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:45,330
And in fact they haven't sent this 
anymore,

2266
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:48,780
you know,
it was difficult.

2267
01:59:48,781 --> 01:59:52,170
But we did get a pair and I am very 
grateful for that.

2268
01:59:52,171 --> 01:59:54,360
So what,
so let me ask you this,

2269
01:59:54,630 --> 01:59:55,463
would you,
are you happy that I added you or would 

2270
01:59:57,031 --> 01:59:58,770
you prefer to go back and erase that 
moment?

2271
01:59:59,850 --> 02:00:03,930
Well either way I have yeezys like where
I'm not added.

2272
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:08,330
Those are real everybody.
So it's a win win,

2273
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:10,670
you know,
it's a zero sum game,

2274
02:00:11,010 --> 02:00:13,830
but I guess I have real ones now.
You had real ones,

2275
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:16,390
but they're not real.
Let me ask you this.

2276
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:18,430
Are the real ones more comfortable than 
the fake ones?

2277
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:22,520
It's a different.
He's different material,

2278
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:27,190
but how does it compare because you've 
got fake think are pretty comfy.

2279
02:00:27,230 --> 02:00:29,300
Um,
I think they're,

2280
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:30,153
yeah,
they're comfier than the fake ones for 

2281
02:00:31,931 --> 02:00:33,180
sure.
If the right thing to say.

2282
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,113
Yeah.

2283
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:36,490
And I,
and now I'm glad.

2284
02:00:36,491 --> 02:00:37,324
I'm not going to find.
I'm convinced now that his shoes are 

2285
02:00:41,711 --> 02:00:43,460
more available than,
you know,

2286
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:44,343
there's no need to buy the fake ones.
So if you see me in any other pair of 

2287
02:00:47,011 --> 02:00:51,220
the real,
I don't look at,

2288
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:53,920
don't get too close.
Very real easy.

2289
02:00:53,921 --> 02:00:57,910
Bus is going to be all open.
But those were my,

2290
02:00:58,040 --> 02:01:00,500
uh,
all of my moments best and worst.

2291
02:01:00,501 --> 02:01:01,040
So,
uh,

2292
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:02,250
yeah,
that's it.

2293
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:06,780
That was fun.
Let's see what else we got here.

2294
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:11,640
Wow.
Seen it all.

2295
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:15,810
We've done it at all.
It was nice to remember two hours.

2296
02:01:16,290 --> 02:01:18,990
Wow.
That's a lot of talk about,

2297
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:21,690
you know.
Well,

2298
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:22,980
we've got one other.
Do we,

2299
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:25,230
are we going to take that call in from 
debunker real.

2300
02:01:25,350 --> 02:01:27,760
Oh,
let me go get it.

2301
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:30,360
While you're preparing that,
I have a fan submission.

2302
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:35,500
Remember you can always submit to 
podcast at h three,

2303
02:01:35,501 --> 02:01:38,500
h three productions.com
if you have any question.

2304
02:01:38,501 --> 02:01:40,760
Submissions is we want to,
you want us to watch,

2305
02:01:40,770 --> 02:01:42,600
etc.
But this one can be

2306
02:01:43,930 --> 02:01:44,763
best and worst moments.
People suBmitted a lot and it was very 

2307
02:01:47,211 --> 02:01:47,700
hard.

2308
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:49,170
That was amazing.
Thank you guys.

2309
02:01:50,130 --> 02:01:55,130
But this one comes from jay dance in 
regards to our charity live stream and I

2310
02:01:55,531 --> 02:01:56,364
thought it was,
it was very sweet and addressed one of 

2311
02:01:58,471 --> 02:02:00,420
the points we were wondering about.
So here,

2312
02:02:00,421 --> 02:02:03,360
I'll read it a hello everyone at the age
three.

2313
02:02:03,361 --> 02:02:04,194
My name is j.dance
and I'm a huge fan of the podcast and 

2314
02:02:06,481 --> 02:02:09,390
got into podcasting because of you guys.
I'm writing you guys today,

2315
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:12,840
um,
because of the charity event podcast you

2316
02:02:12,841 --> 02:02:15,060
guys did yesterday with justin rolland 
and alex hirsch.

2317
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:18,540
I'm from paradise,
California and most of my family friends

2318
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:21,000
have lost everything due to the 
campfire.

2319
02:02:21,001 --> 02:02:23,620
I just want to say thank you for doing 
this charity podcast.

2320
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:26,160
It means so much to all of us.
The suPport and help.

2321
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:28,920
And then she goes on.
Oh,

2322
02:02:28,921 --> 02:02:31,680
and one more thing you guys should,
you guys talked about,

2323
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:33,043
um,
one more thing you guys talked about 

2324
02:02:36,721 --> 02:02:41,010
what you would take if you had a chance 
to evacuate and most of you said dog,

2325
02:02:41,011 --> 02:02:44,820
of course the media has given backlash 
towards people leaving their pets,

2326
02:02:44,821 --> 02:02:46,530
which on paper I would have to.

2327
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:49,260
The truth is when the fire head 
paradise,

2328
02:02:49,261 --> 02:02:50,700
it was around 8:00
AM,

2329
02:02:50,940 --> 02:02:51,840
8:30
AM,

2330
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:52,853
so by that time most people had already 
gone to work or school and drop their 

2331
02:02:56,221 --> 02:02:59,070
kids off at school.
Paradise being a small town,

2332
02:02:59,071 --> 02:02:59,904
most people don't work in paradise and 
mute out of town and the surrounding 

2333
02:03:03,151 --> 02:03:04,890
cities like chico,
red bluff reading,

2334
02:03:04,910 --> 02:03:05,743
etc.
So when the fire hit paradise and when 

2335
02:03:07,561 --> 02:03:08,394
it did hit it very quickly,
people did not even have the time to go 

2336
02:03:11,311 --> 02:03:15,270
back to paradise to get their pets or 
any personal belongings because it was,

2337
02:03:15,730 --> 02:03:19,970
you know,
I wanted to share this with you guys and

2338
02:03:20,030 --> 02:03:23,760
that does actually explain it.
Anyway,

2339
02:03:23,761 --> 02:03:27,090
thanks for being awesome people and I 
always looking forward to the show.

2340
02:03:27,091 --> 02:03:27,924
Thank you so much jay dance.
So that actually puts it even more in 

2341
02:03:30,301 --> 02:03:33,240
perspective because you go off to work 
or school,

2342
02:03:33,570 --> 02:03:38,250
you don't even have a chance to get not 
only your pet but any of your belongings

2343
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:40,403
be so devastated.
If I couldn'T go take care of shredder 

2344
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:45,810
and you know that something's up

2345
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:50,980
that makes art because I feel like a lot
of the videos I watched were people were

2346
02:03:50,981 --> 02:03:54,910
trying to drive back into it was because
of their pets and I did wonder that.

2347
02:03:54,911 --> 02:03:55,744
So yeah,

2348
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:58,930
I mean god,
that's so heart wrenching.

2349
02:03:58,931 --> 02:04:02,650
Like to not to feel helpless like 
shredders in the house.

2350
02:04:02,651 --> 02:04:04,660
Right.
And you don't know if it's on fire.

2351
02:04:04,661 --> 02:04:05,650
Like what?
Like I don't,

2352
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:09,200
I would run into the fire.
I guess that's what some people will try

2353
02:04:09,201 --> 02:04:10,034
it.
I mean it's just like such a betrayal 

2354
02:04:11,591 --> 02:04:13,690
and your poor pet is at home.
Scared,

2355
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:17,770
confused looking for you.
That's so devastating.

2356
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:24,900
I'm glad that this direct relief can 
help anyone.

2357
02:04:25,300 --> 02:04:26,620
Right?
And just to revisit,

2358
02:04:26,621 --> 02:04:29,570
because dan is setting up a call with,
with a,

2359
02:04:29,630 --> 02:04:30,463
a person that paid a thousand dollars.
I want to urge you guys all link in the 

2360
02:04:37,321 --> 02:04:39,090
description.
It's below the sponsors,

2361
02:04:39,091 --> 02:04:39,924

everybody who lost their homes in the 

2363
02:04:47,671 --> 02:04:52,230
fire.
And this goes directly to support them.

2364
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:57,720
There's so many incredible gifts still 
available,

2365
02:04:58,490 --> 02:05:00,090
um,
some with,

2366
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:05,180
with bid so low that you have an 
incredibly high chance of winning it,

2367
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:06,353
especially all the original art that I 
would heavily urge you guys to go bid 

2368
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:11,753
on.
Let me see how we're doing.

2369
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:13,680
Tilt the five

2370
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:17,870
if you just go to [inaudible] dot com.
Rondo.

2371
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:19,071
Oh,
nice.

2372
02:05:19,071 --> 02:05:20,960
Has been going up since we started live 
streaming.

2373
02:05:21,530 --> 02:05:24,560
Um,
here we are at 1:30

2374
02:05:24,561 --> 02:05:25,394
till the rewards.
I'm telling you there's this shit is 

2375
02:05:28,131 --> 02:05:32,330
just up for grabs.
All the original art is just like.

2376
02:05:32,331 --> 02:05:35,540
I think this one is the one that had 80,
80 bucks.

2377
02:05:36,340 --> 02:05:38,660
Is it an original alex hirsch?
Wait,

2378
02:05:38,661 --> 02:05:39,494
no,
not this one.

2379
02:05:39,530 --> 02:05:43,480
It was the original justin reuland 
artwork by alex.

2380
02:05:43,790 --> 02:05:45,800
Oh god.
He got sloppier and sloppier.

2381
02:05:45,801 --> 02:05:50,801
No wonder nobody's betting on that.
$8.

2382
02:05:51,681 --> 02:05:54,170
Is that what it was?
I don't know which one to hear.

2383
02:05:54,171 --> 02:05:56,950
Hold on the one that's at $8.
Justin.

2384
02:05:56,970 --> 02:05:58,670
So funny.
God,

2385
02:05:59,180 --> 02:06:01,960
it's still adjusting reuland originally.
He doesn't make sense.

2386
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:06,260
Why is it not letting me.
Oh,

2387
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:11,500
this is really.
I'll tell you which one was eight bucks.

2388
02:06:13,521 --> 02:06:14,780
Here.
Let me give you the rundown.

2389
02:06:16,100 --> 02:06:20,150
If I can find it.
Can I find it original?

2390
02:06:20,151 --> 02:06:21,010
Alex?
You know,

2391
02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:21,863
it's the,
the eight bucks one is alex hirsch's 

2392
02:06:24,110 --> 02:06:28,280
drawing of justin rayland,
which that deserves to come on people.

2393
02:06:28,310 --> 02:06:30,950
That was amazing.
Oh waiT,

2394
02:06:30,951 --> 02:06:31,421
where's the.
Oh,

2395
02:06:31,421 --> 02:06:34,310
I don't have the document.
I have it open right now.

2396
02:06:34,311 --> 02:06:36,590
So let me share it with ethan.
I wait.

2397
02:06:36,591 --> 02:06:38,660
I would like to it.
yeah.

2398
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:41,133
That's weird.

2399
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,400
So here we go.
Yes.

2400
02:06:45,610 --> 02:06:46,720
Oh,
it's not letting me

2401
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:50,580
look at this shit.
I can't click the tab on the bottom.

2402
02:06:51,030 --> 02:06:51,970
It's hidden.
What do,

2403
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:53,730
what do you want to know though?
I'm looking at it right now.

2404
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:57,060
Okay.
So here we go.

2405
02:06:57,090 --> 02:06:59,250
Did you get the fan on the phone than I 
do?

2406
02:06:59,251 --> 02:07:00,900
He's on hold.
So let's take the call.

2407
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:02,170
Take the call now.
yeah.

2408
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:03,083
Alright.
stand by.

2409
02:07:03,090 --> 02:07:05,490
I've got them in original.
Alex hirsch.

2410
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:07,750
You should show all the crazy graphs 
that sarah.

2411
02:07:08,300 --> 02:07:11,060
Oh yes.
Fucking ham on,

2412
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:14,070
on the graph.
Look at that.

2413
02:07:14,390 --> 02:07:16,700
The one that I really like is the,
um,

2414
02:07:17,310 --> 02:07:22,200
this is like hourly donation rate.
So you can see when justin.

2415
02:07:23,050 --> 02:07:24,480
Justin rally.
Exactly.

2416
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:27,150
We did.
We dipped so hard.

2417
02:07:27,170 --> 02:07:28,500
Wait,
that's at the end of the.

2418
02:07:28,530 --> 02:07:29,363
Okay.
That's the end.

2419
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:33,120
So here we were hitting this mid point 
and we're like,

2420
02:07:33,121 --> 02:07:33,954
man,
there's no way we're going to make it 

2421
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:37,093
where there's no way.
And then we were at like 75 here and 

2422
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:45,760
this was the rally demand in one hour.
That was actually our Biggest,

2423
02:07:47,711 --> 02:07:51,370
our of the whole stream finale killed 
it.

2424
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:54,840
he came in like brave heart.
Everyone.

2425
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:57,820
Oh,
this is page two.

2426
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:02,780
That's just how much each here's was 
donated by ya.

2427
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:05,960
Don't kill.
Sees this post.

2428
02:08:05,990 --> 02:08:07,010
Okay.
I better not.

2429
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:12,170
I don't know what's best for this.
Both sarah.

2430
02:08:12,171 --> 02:08:15,150
But I'm scared you go to the spirit 
realm if you clicked that.

2431
02:08:15,170 --> 02:08:15,920
Yeah,
that's right.

2432
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:17,830
So let's patch.
So who we got on the phone here?

2433
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:18,460
So,
uh,

2434
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:21,300
this is a gentlemen who goes by fifths 
and he's a fan.

2435
02:08:21,301 --> 02:08:24,720
He's a big fan of the podcast we watched
in a long time and he,

2436
02:08:24,721 --> 02:08:25,554
um,
during the donation stream donated a 

2437
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:30,310
thousand bucks when you did the shout 
out to have a color,

2438
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:31,353
a call land,
but he had an international number and 

2439
02:08:34,711 --> 02:08:35,544
our phone system,
the phone system wouldn't let us get to 

2440
02:08:38,821 --> 02:08:41,880
them and so we had kind of a technical 
issue getting through to him.

2441
02:08:41,881 --> 02:08:43,890
So to make it up to him,
we're talking to them today.

2442
02:08:43,891 --> 02:08:46,860
So here is phipps,
right?

2443
02:08:47,980 --> 02:08:52,980
A resume call right now.
Fifths.

2444
02:08:56,110 --> 02:08:57,560
Hey,
what's up?

2445
02:08:57,650 --> 02:09:02,650
Hey you.
First of all,

2446
02:09:02,870 --> 02:09:04,670
thank you so much.
You've donated,

2447
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:08,690
you helped us get to a 100,000.
Your legend.

2448
02:09:08,691 --> 02:09:11,600
I'm sorry we didn't get to answer your 
call during that live stream,

2449
02:09:11,601 --> 02:09:12,434
but I am

2450
02:09:15,070 --> 02:09:16,180
the whole,
the whole gang.

2451
02:09:16,181 --> 02:09:18,100
It was really crazy.
The old podcast.

2452
02:09:18,610 --> 02:09:19,443
It wasn't about the cost specifically.
You guys are doing this for a great 

2453
02:09:21,821 --> 02:09:23,530
cause and I really appreciate what you 
guys are doing.

2454
02:09:23,730 --> 02:09:25,260
God bless.
Thank you so much,

2455
02:09:25,261 --> 02:09:26,280
man.
You're doing it.

2456
02:09:26,430 --> 02:09:30,480
I want to ask you,
since we're in the spirit of sharing our

2457
02:09:30,481 --> 02:09:33,900
favorite moments,
do you have a favorite moment that,

2458
02:09:33,901 --> 02:09:35,260
uh,
as I,

2459
02:09:35,270 --> 02:09:36,060
as,
as a,

2460
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:38,310
as a audience member of the podcast,

2461
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:42,060
I mean,
you guys pretty much covered a lot.

2462
02:09:44,410 --> 02:09:46,650
I mean,
the ricky ticky tack,

2463
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:52,430
he was calling the church and he was 
going crazy with the boys.

2464
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:53,100
I was like,
whoa,

2465
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:53,570
whoa,
whoa,

2466
02:09:53,570 --> 02:09:54,750
whoa,
calm down.

2467
02:09:55,210 --> 02:09:57,290
Like I didn't think that he would take 
it that far.

2468
02:09:57,291 --> 02:09:58,710
I think it was like a little,
you know,

2469
02:09:58,740 --> 02:10:00,240
goof.
And then he Just stopped.

2470
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:02,190
He just kept on going and I really love 
it.

2471
02:10:02,750 --> 02:10:03,583
Yeah.
I was shocked watching that back today 

2472
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:08,480
actually.
How crazy that call was that later?

2473
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:10,060
No,
it was just really awesome.

2474
02:10:10,061 --> 02:10:12,040
Like I really like,
the thing is,

2475
02:10:12,041 --> 02:10:15,100
is that what I love about the podcast 
itself is that,

2476
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:18,520
you know,
you guys have this kind of formula going

2477
02:10:18,521 --> 02:10:21,340
on,
but you diversify in a way that you have

2478
02:10:21,341 --> 02:10:25,210
always these new elements coming in.
So you have ruined in a couple of times.

2479
02:10:25,211 --> 02:10:26,044
Right?
But every time he comes in there's 

2480
02:10:27,011 --> 02:10:29,440
something new added to the mix,
like new elements,

2481
02:10:29,530 --> 02:10:32,140
which is something as an audience member
like,

2482
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:32,990
oh,
we shit,

2483
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:34,160
you know.
Damn,

2484
02:10:34,350 --> 02:10:36,990
thank you.
That's awesome to hear you work hard.

2485
02:10:36,991 --> 02:10:38,360
It is.
Sometimes doesn't.

2486
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:41,910
Maybe it's not easy to spot,
but we've,

2487
02:10:42,170 --> 02:10:44,870
I mean we try,
we work hard on the,

2488
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:47,060
on the show and I,
and I'm glad to hear that,

2489
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:51,010
that you appreciate it.
And we're working hard.

2490
02:10:51,290 --> 02:10:52,910
I think.
I'm hoping that um,

2491
02:10:53,390 --> 02:10:56,690
when we come back for like one slash one
plus the new season,

2492
02:10:56,691 --> 02:10:57,524
I want to call it in a month,
I want to redo a lot of things and kind 

2493
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:04,250
of reimagine what we do here and freshen
it up a lot.

2494
02:11:04,251 --> 02:11:08,390
I've got some fun ideas and I'm like,
well one thing we talked.

2495
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:10,070
Oh go ahead.
What do you got for me?

2496
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:13,580
No,
it was just asking you about like,

2497
02:11:13,590 --> 02:11:15,110
you know,
cause you have two channels,

2498
02:11:15,111 --> 02:11:17,840
right?
So you got a little bit of the criticism

2499
02:11:17,841 --> 02:11:20,960
about kind of like how you're balancing 
up the channels and everything.

2500
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:22,610
I don't only need to get into it too 
much,

2501
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:26,090
but like you're putting a lot of effort 
into the podcast,

2502
02:11:26,091 --> 02:11:26,924
whIch is awesome,
but like how would you balance out that 

2503
02:11:28,971 --> 02:11:31,940
effort with the main channel vh date?
She productions.

2504
02:11:32,610 --> 02:11:33,443
So I think a misconception that people 
have is that my lack of uploads on h 

2505
02:11:39,821 --> 02:11:44,500
three,
h three was due to me focusing my energy

2506
02:11:44,501 --> 02:11:49,501
to the podcast when the truth of why I 
wasn't posting there had wasn't an issue

2507
02:11:50,921 --> 02:11:54,010
of time or commitment or anything like 
that.

2508
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:55,143
It was really a result of not knowing 
what to do there or not feeling like I 

2509
02:11:59,351 --> 02:12:00,184
was in the right head space or having a 
lack of motivation or just a lot of 

2510
02:12:03,851 --> 02:12:06,520
negative bad feelings around posting 
there.

2511
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:09,220
So for me it's a lot of people were 
like,

2512
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:10,113
oh,
he stopped posting there because the 

2513
02:12:11,831 --> 02:12:14,950
podcast is more lucrative and he doesn't
care about his fans or whatever.

2514
02:12:14,951 --> 02:12:15,784
Again,
just kind of people always want to see 

2515
02:12:17,021 --> 02:12:20,050
the worst in it and like just assume the
worst about people.

2516
02:12:20,350 --> 02:12:21,183
But the truth of the matter is,
and one that I'm addressing now as best 

2517
02:12:23,891 --> 02:12:26,770
as I can,
is that I,

2518
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:29,950
I am and was depressed.

2519
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:31,810
I mean I'm doing much better now I 
think,

2520
02:12:31,820 --> 02:12:32,653
and something that I'm working on,
but I had a lot of anxiety and a lot of 

2521
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:38,530
issues,
um,

2522
02:12:39,130 --> 02:12:44,130
that I needed to resolve and a lot of it
was manifesting itself through how I did

2523
02:12:44,861 --> 02:12:48,640
my work there in my primary source of 
entertainment.

2524
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:53,880
And so the podcast was honestly a way 
for me to not disappear.

2525
02:12:56,080 --> 02:13:01,080
It was a way for me to stay present and 
to still be working and to still share,

2526
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:03,333
share my life and be with our,
with the people that want that want to 

2527
02:13:07,031 --> 02:13:07,864
continue to watch us.
so for me the podcast was something to 

2528
02:13:11,591 --> 02:13:12,424
do while I sorted that shit out and it's
been an incredible resource for me to 

2529
02:13:19,931 --> 02:13:23,380
come here and be able to share my 
thoughts and to not just disappear,

2530
02:13:23,381 --> 02:13:24,214
right?
Because that's not something I ever 

2531
02:13:25,751 --> 02:13:27,850
wanted to do.
And so I,

2532
02:13:28,060 --> 02:13:28,893
again,
I just think it's a misconception 

2533
02:13:30,130 --> 02:13:30,963
because now we're back posting videos 
there and we're doing both and it's 

2534
02:13:33,421 --> 02:13:34,980
fine.
I mean we're busier,

2535
02:13:34,981 --> 02:13:35,814
but it's good.
I like being busy and I like feeling 

2536
02:13:37,111 --> 02:13:37,944
productive and

2537
02:13:37,970 --> 02:13:38,803
well I really appreciate that.
I think mental health is something 

2538
02:13:41,311 --> 02:13:45,300
that's really not addressed a lot in the
media and the way that it is addressed.

2539
02:13:45,301 --> 02:13:47,450
That feels a little bit underplayed.
A,

2540
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:51,360
it almost seems as if it's like a,
a capital brand capitalists brand.

2541
02:13:51,361 --> 02:13:53,700
It's almost like something with the 
better health situation.

2542
02:13:53,701 --> 02:13:55,560
Everything.
I'm not going to pick it up again,

2543
02:13:55,860 --> 02:13:56,693
but the thing iS,
is that the way that you're taking it 

2544
02:13:57,931 --> 02:14:01,530
very head on and seriously,
I think I can personally commend that.

2545
02:14:01,531 --> 02:14:04,560
I admire a few hurdles in my life as 
well.

2546
02:14:04,940 --> 02:14:05,773
Uh,
but I feel as though also when you were 

2547
02:14:08,071 --> 02:14:09,400
talking about,
you know,

2548
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:13,250
kind of facing an impasse indian year a 
uploaded,

2549
02:14:13,530 --> 02:14:17,070
because I remember like when ray William
Johnson stopped posting,

2550
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:18,053
you said something along the lines of he
no longer feels gratitude and doing the 

2551
02:14:21,031 --> 02:14:21,864
same thing over and over again.
So it got me thinking that if you keep 

2552
02:14:24,451 --> 02:14:28,770
doing the same type of style,
the same formulaic technique,

2553
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:29,820
a,
wouldn't you?

2554
02:14:29,820 --> 02:14:32,940
Would you feel like less intellectually 
challenged by doing these videos?

2555
02:14:33,870 --> 02:14:34,703
Well,
the truth is that I think so much of an 

2556
02:14:37,861 --> 02:14:38,694
even maybe what he's saying,
so much of the negative feelings that 

2557
02:14:41,671 --> 02:14:42,504
you might feel is a symptom of a 
depressive state and not actually an 

2558
02:14:46,021 --> 02:14:46,854
expressive,
an expression of like your creative art 

2559
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:50,513
and that there's always a way to 
challenge yourself and there's always a 

2560
02:14:53,701 --> 02:14:58,320
way to make it fresh and interesting.
The fact is that when you're depressed,

2561
02:14:58,590 --> 02:14:59,423
you see everything through that lens.
And so something I've learned about 

2562
02:15:02,431 --> 02:15:07,431
myself is that before I started actually
treating my depression with medicine and

2563
02:15:07,831 --> 02:15:09,510
therapy,
is that you try,

2564
02:15:09,570 --> 02:15:10,403
you scramble and scramble and try to 
address your depression because you 

2565
02:15:13,981 --> 02:15:14,814
don't.
You don't know or you haven't accepted 

2566
02:15:16,381 --> 02:15:17,460
that you're depressed,
right?

2567
02:15:17,670 --> 02:15:18,503
So you're trying and in your Mind and in
your life to address all of these 

2568
02:15:22,021 --> 02:15:23,040
different issues that,
oh,

2569
02:15:23,041 --> 02:15:25,350
that's why this and that's why that and 
that's why this,

2570
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:29,880
but the truth is you're never actually 
addressing the root problem.

2571
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:32,400
You're addressing symptoms but never the
root problem.

2572
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:35,280
So when you're depressed and you don't 
address that,

2573
02:15:35,610 --> 02:15:38,900
you're always looking for some answer 
and you always to change.

2574
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:39,893
And the sad thing about it is that 
you're never going to fix it until you 

2575
02:15:42,631 --> 02:15:44,790
address the root cause.
So for me,

2576
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:45,863
now that I'm feeling better,
making videos is a wholesome thing and 

2577
02:15:48,991 --> 02:15:49,824
I'm content doing it.
Where before I was always looking for 

2578
02:15:52,471 --> 02:15:53,610
something else,
I was like,

2579
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:56,520
I need to make a show.
I need to work on the podcast more.

2580
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:58,470
I need to get off you.
I need,

2581
02:15:58,471 --> 02:16:00,810
I need to do all these other things.
But those were never the answer.

2582
02:16:00,811 --> 02:16:05,811
Those were just me looking in vain for 
something to make me feel better because

2583
02:16:06,091 --> 02:16:09,030
I didn't actually understand.
But now that I'm in a better place,

2584
02:16:09,031 --> 02:16:12,270
I can see that this is a good place for 
me.

2585
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:13,313
And it is a whole someplace for me and 
If you want to express yourself 

2586
02:16:16,471 --> 02:16:19,950
creatively,
there's always a room within the formula

2587
02:16:19,951 --> 02:16:23,550
you've created to,
to find a good,

2588
02:16:23,551 --> 02:16:24,780
wholesome,
productive,

2589
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:25,793
happy place.
It's just a matter of coming at it 

2590
02:16:28,021 --> 02:16:29,410
through the light lens.
I mean,

2591
02:16:29,411 --> 02:16:30,244
it really is a half glass,
a glass half full half empty thing and 

2592
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:37,960
when you're depressed it's sad is sadly 
is always half empty and you really just

2593
02:16:37,961 --> 02:16:40,780
can never see the flip side of it.
And so

2594
02:16:41,010 --> 02:16:44,130
the perspective is very difficult to see
in a positive light.

2595
02:16:44,131 --> 02:16:45,760
Yeah,
I completely agree.

2596
02:16:47,130 --> 02:16:49,250
So I want to make this a little bit.
Uh,

2597
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:51,270
I didn't mean to drag the mood down,

2598
02:16:51,570 --> 02:16:53,020
never mind it.
All the good questions.

2599
02:16:53,021 --> 02:16:53,854
I'm happy to talk about it.
You didn't drag it on if people were 

2600
02:16:57,311 --> 02:16:59,780
wondering the same thing.
So it's good actually to talk

2601
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:02,890
good about it.
And since you know,

2602
02:17:02,891 --> 02:17:03,724
we're,
we're in the spirit of bringing up 

2603
02:17:04,871 --> 02:17:05,704
things at the end of the year.
I thought maybe it would be a little 

2604
02:17:08,470 --> 02:17:09,303
nice mentioned,
mentioned some of your best moments in 

2605
02:17:11,561 --> 02:17:14,050
terms of videos on hd productions.
Right?

2606
02:17:14,770 --> 02:17:19,770
I really love the a gold digger.
It was,

2607
02:17:19,970 --> 02:17:23,290
it was honestly a really nice highlight 
for me because,

2608
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:25,390
you know,
I mean,

2609
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:28,240
all you did was literally say,
you know,

2610
02:17:28,250 --> 02:17:29,083
the,
the guys just fucking following the 

2611
02:17:30,551 --> 02:17:33,400
woman.
The woman was being completely honest,

2612
02:17:33,401 --> 02:17:37,390
which is exactly true.
And the thing is that repetition was,

2613
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:38,273
was the highlight of the whole video 
with it's the same thing over and over 

2614
02:17:41,561 --> 02:17:43,900
and over again.
The cracks me up every single time,

2615
02:17:43,901 --> 02:17:44,390
honestly.

2616
02:17:44,390 --> 02:17:45,171
Well,
that's awesome.

2617
02:17:45,171 --> 02:17:48,100
Thank you so much.
That was a great one.

2618
02:17:48,110 --> 02:17:48,650
That's great.
Yeah,

2619
02:17:48,650 --> 02:17:52,160
I liked it because it was,
it was a little bit of a twist because I

2620
02:17:52,161 --> 02:17:55,790
kinda resent all the gold digger content
you see on youtube.

2621
02:17:55,791 --> 02:17:58,940
I always thought it was just so 
ridiculous.

2622
02:17:58,941 --> 02:17:59,774
And um,
when you finally get to see inside this 

2623
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:03,433
quote unquote gold digger relationship,
you realize that he's the flyer and 

2624
02:18:08,001 --> 02:18:08,834
she's completely honest about her 
expectations in the beginning and he's 

2625
02:18:12,081 --> 02:18:13,190
the one that mess.
Let her.

2626
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:14,033
Right.
That was kind of a funny twist on the 

2627
02:18:16,311 --> 02:18:18,470
whole narrative of the gold digger.

2628
02:18:20,050 --> 02:18:20,883
Yeah,
no.

2629
02:18:20,890 --> 02:18:22,270
And uh,
honestly,

2630
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:24,530
the thing is,
is that it's.

2631
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:27,830
People look at things like specifically,
you know,

2632
02:18:28,030 --> 02:18:29,770
she's a gold digger,
she wants money.

2633
02:18:29,980 --> 02:18:31,870
That's a negative thing.
He's the victim.

2634
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:32,891
Well,
I mean,

2635
02:18:32,891 --> 02:18:33,724
yeah.
Well she said she's just literally 

2636
02:18:35,711 --> 02:18:36,544
saying that doesn't make it negative.
It's negative when you're trying to 

2637
02:18:39,401 --> 02:18:40,234
deceive someone,
not just achieve an objective was being 

2638
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:45,130
hunches that,
hey,

2639
02:18:45,131 --> 02:18:47,290
this is what I want.
Can you give it to me?

2640
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:48,970
Period?
Just gave it to me right there.

2641
02:18:48,990 --> 02:18:49,823
Right.

2642
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:50,693
I don't even think she ever even 
pretended to love him and he's also an 

2643
02:18:53,551 --> 02:18:54,790
interest for her looks.
Yeah.

2644
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:59,800
He wants her finger that wants to date a
pretty girl,

2645
02:19:01,980 --> 02:19:02,740
you know?

2646
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:03,860
Yeah.
You know,

2647
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:04,960
it's,
it's.

2648
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:07,790
I mean it's her hustle,
hustle,

2649
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:09,360
her,
and then the first of all,

2650
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:12,290
the 90 day thing,
it was never meant to work out.

2651
02:19:13,330 --> 02:19:14,760
It's never about.
It's 99.

2652
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:20,020
He's watching this show and that show is
heating season.

2653
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:26,760
Starting in so deep into data happening 
is unimaginable.

2654
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:28,040
People are saying it's the

2655
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:31,190
darkest season ever and they're 
abandoning the show,

2656
02:19:31,191 --> 02:19:34,030
but I'm totally suck then.
No,

2657
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:35,500
I heard that.
That guy,

2658
02:19:36,110 --> 02:19:37,830
the guy from the show got arrested

2659
02:19:38,050 --> 02:19:43,050
or they charge and I plug in.
I called it too because in the show he's

2660
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:47,060
the guys walking around with backpacks 
of weed,

2661
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:49,670
you know,
and then,

2662
02:19:49,740 --> 02:19:52,380
and then a couple months later they're 
like,

2663
02:19:52,410 --> 02:19:53,850
oh,
we're in legal trouble.

2664
02:19:53,851 --> 02:19:56,820
And I was arrested for having tons of 
weed and sure enough,

2665
02:19:57,030 --> 02:19:59,100
he's in prison right now and it's pieces
probably.

2666
02:19:59,550 --> 02:20:01,410
Oh,
she's been like lifting weights.

2667
02:20:01,830 --> 02:20:05,520
You've seen her.
She's all armed georgie.

2668
02:20:05,521 --> 02:20:06,354
Boy,

2669
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:10,260
look,
if you're going to flex about business,

2670
02:20:10,470 --> 02:20:11,370
I mean,
come on,

2671
02:20:12,190 --> 02:20:13,910
what do you expect to happen?
You're going to

2672
02:20:14,330 --> 02:20:15,163
tv.
And the funny thing is that he's a drug 

2673
02:20:18,391 --> 02:20:20,810
dealer that's not even that rich like 
kid.

2674
02:20:20,830 --> 02:20:22,920
If you're going to do drugs,
at least be richer than that.

2675
02:20:25,930 --> 02:20:27,820
There's two levels of pathetic,
right?

2676
02:20:28,380 --> 02:20:29,213
There's,
there's,

2677
02:20:29,440 --> 02:20:30,250
there's,
you know,

2678
02:20:30,250 --> 02:20:31,600
the crummy drug dealing,
yada,

2679
02:20:31,601 --> 02:20:32,620
yada.
But then there's,

2680
02:20:32,770 --> 02:20:33,603
you know,
pretending to be a successful one at 

2681
02:20:35,171 --> 02:20:37,960
that to pretend to be a successful 
loser.

2682
02:20:37,990 --> 02:20:40,440
you know,
that's just,

2683
02:20:40,441 --> 02:20:41,830
it.
Just pick it for me like that.

2684
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:45,620
And honestly,
I just wanted to also tell you that,

2685
02:20:45,850 --> 02:20:47,380
you know,
your commentary style,

2686
02:20:47,381 --> 02:20:49,420
everything you've done for the past 
high.

2687
02:20:49,470 --> 02:20:51,460
No,
I don't have the exact number of years,

2688
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:53,410
but you've been doing.
It's really awesome.

2689
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:56,980
it kind of pushed me to start my own 
youtube and everything.

2690
02:20:57,370 --> 02:21:01,480
So I had a little,
a few questions before I do my shameless

2691
02:21:01,481 --> 02:21:03,460
plug in.
Before I get there,

2692
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:07,120
I have some genuine questions for you.
So what,

2693
02:21:07,180 --> 02:21:08,013
since we're at the end of the year,
this is also kind of a little did 

2694
02:21:10,580 --> 02:21:11,413
retrospective,
what first motivated you to make these 

2695
02:21:12,761 --> 02:21:13,594
videos?

2696
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:15,073
Um,
well I knew that I wanted to work in 

2697
02:21:17,571 --> 02:21:18,404
comedy for a long time Just because it 
was something I was always passionate 

2698
02:21:20,901 --> 02:21:22,760
about,
but I Really never,

2699
02:21:23,690 --> 02:21:24,523
I didn't have any connections.
I didn't know anyone and I didn't have 

2700
02:21:27,171 --> 02:21:30,950
any experience making comedy.
So um,

2701
02:21:31,730 --> 02:21:32,563
I think I've mentioned this before but,
but well either we made a couple of 

2702
02:21:36,291 --> 02:21:39,050
videos for els class and it was really 
fun and I,

2703
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:40,183
And I actually thought I had a knack for
it even though they weren't good or 

2704
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:46,310
they're very weird,
but I really enjoyed the process.

2705
02:21:46,311 --> 02:21:47,144
So for me it was kind of started as just
a creative outlet and kind of honing my 

2706
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:56,560
craft and figuring out my style and I'm 
just slowly turned into having a youtube

2707
02:22:00,141 --> 02:22:00,974
channel,
which is funny because when we started 

2708
02:22:02,121 --> 02:22:06,830
making youtube videos I didn't even know
you to being a youtuber was a thing.

2709
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:08,113
I am,
we just posted it there but we didn't 

2710
02:22:10,791 --> 02:22:11,900
know like,
yeah,

2711
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:12,411
it,
it,

2712
02:22:12,411 --> 02:22:13,244
it,
it was just basically a hobby that 

2713
02:22:15,741 --> 02:22:19,520
somehow slowly started turning into 
something serious.

2714
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:22,233
But I guess she had had some kind of 
continuous motivation at the beginning 

2715
02:22:25,711 --> 02:22:26,544
of youtube.
The idea of monetization was just this 

2716
02:22:28,531 --> 02:22:29,620
abstract,
you know,

2717
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:30,900
far away thought.
Right.

2718
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:34,590
So you were doing it based on personal 
ambition,

2719
02:22:34,591 --> 02:22:35,424
personal,
I guess ambition to succeed in this 

2720
02:22:37,981 --> 02:22:39,120
industry which is youtube.

2721
02:22:39,590 --> 02:22:40,423
Well,
my original idea was that I was like 

2722
02:22:42,651 --> 02:22:45,950
making a portfolio because at best I 
thought,

2723
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:46,873
hey,
I could be a writer or something for 

2724
02:22:48,650 --> 02:22:49,483
comedy.
So I was just thinking of youtube as a 

2725
02:22:51,861 --> 02:22:56,861
stepping stone of kind of just building 
a portfolio and honing my craft and just

2726
02:22:57,771 --> 02:23:00,290
as a hobby to do that,
I don't have anything better to do.

2727
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:05,150
So I,
I was thinking of it in the beginning as

2728
02:23:05,151 --> 02:23:07,490
a portfolio,
something like that and be like,

2729
02:23:07,491 --> 02:23:08,324
hey,
if I could make a couple of funny 

2730
02:23:08,841 --> 02:23:12,470
videos,
then maybe I can get a job somewhere.

2731
02:23:14,700 --> 02:23:16,410
I made a lot of people from college 
humor.

2732
02:23:16,411 --> 02:23:17,600
That's what they did,
you know,

2733
02:23:17,610 --> 02:23:18,320
the,
uh,

2734
02:23:18,320 --> 02:23:21,060
it became writers at the daily show,
stuff like that.

2735
02:23:21,061 --> 02:23:24,390
I completely get you.
I'm fair enough,

2736
02:23:24,391 --> 02:23:25,520
I guess,
uh,

2737
02:23:25,620 --> 02:23:27,300
you know,
first of all,

2738
02:23:27,301 --> 02:23:28,500
I,
I know this is,

2739
02:23:28,830 --> 02:23:31,350
this is a little bit of a funny story 
concerning your name.

2740
02:23:31,351 --> 02:23:35,070
I'm from Saudi Arabia and we have this 
weird thing with the language.

2741
02:23:35,071 --> 02:23:35,904
Basically the letters and the numbers.
Some numbers because we have different 

2742
02:23:39,331 --> 02:23:40,050
letters,
right?

2743
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:40,883
It's an arabic.
So some letters are expressed witH 

2744
02:23:43,321 --> 02:23:44,154
numbers and when I was trying to plug 
your channel to everyone I guess in 

2745
02:23:49,141 --> 02:23:52,020
school when I was a kid I would just say
h three,

2746
02:23:52,021 --> 02:23:52,854
h three and the thing is is that when 
they read that it says everyone sounded 

2747
02:23:58,831 --> 02:23:59,940
like,
you know,

2748
02:24:00,690 --> 02:24:05,130
like fat albert and it was so weird like
that alberta getting,

2749
02:24:05,170 --> 02:24:06,780
having a stroke or something or the 
other.

2750
02:24:07,170 --> 02:24:08,003
So basIcally I was plugging it 
everywhere and people thought I was 

2751
02:24:11,011 --> 02:24:11,844
spasming.

2752
02:24:13,370 --> 02:24:14,840
How do you say it in like a

2753
02:24:15,790 --> 02:24:18,160
and what an arabic.
How do you say it?

2754
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:21,240
What do you mean?
Like how were you saying it?

2755
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:23,470
I said h three,
h three,

2756
02:24:23,471 --> 02:24:24,304
but I would send them

2757
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:27,800
texts or read it.
So how would they read it?

2758
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:33,760
They would say like bill cosby.
Memorable.

2759
02:24:44,350 --> 02:24:46,580
But yeah,
honestly you've been a great inspiration

2760
02:24:46,581 --> 02:24:48,860
to me.
I don't have anything else to say.

2761
02:24:48,861 --> 02:24:51,350
I just have a few messages I wanted to 
say.

2762
02:24:51,351 --> 02:24:52,184
I hope you don't mind.
So you're calling right now from Saudi 

2763
02:24:54,830 --> 02:24:56,300
Arabia.
Oh yeah.

2764
02:24:56,301 --> 02:24:57,134
I'm calling you guys from Saudi Arabia.
Interesting that you guys have a huge 

2765
02:25:00,801 --> 02:25:05,801
fan base here.
Interesting how interesting.

2766
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:11,880
I can tell you every country then,
is there anything weird

2767
02:25:11,900 --> 02:25:14,840
is going on with like politically like 
um,

2768
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:19,400
you can't talk about that.
Yeah,

2769
02:25:20,380 --> 02:25:21,790
I can talk to you about like,
well,

2770
02:25:21,791 --> 02:25:24,130
I can tell you some good stuff.
Can't tell you the best

2771
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:27,910
stuff I can tell you about the uh,
you know,

2772
02:25:27,970 --> 02:25:28,803
uh,
they had the first concert with mixed 

2773
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:31,181
like,
you know,

2774
02:25:31,181 --> 02:25:34,450
the men and women used to be segregated 
and that just,

2775
02:25:34,510 --> 02:25:36,500
they just had the first concert with 
black ips.

2776
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:37,760
David gets,
uh,

2777
02:25:37,790 --> 02:25:40,060
they,
they removed the segregation between men

2778
02:25:40,061 --> 02:25:41,620
and women,
whiCh is a huge thing.

2779
02:25:41,830 --> 02:25:43,850
Interesting.
Have you been,

2780
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:46,190
have you been outside of Saudi Arabia?

2781
02:25:47,020 --> 02:25:47,671
Uh,
yeah,

2782
02:25:47,671 --> 02:25:48,840
totally.
I'm actually,

2783
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:49,793
I studied in the uk.
I'm just back for christmas break and 

2784
02:25:54,421 --> 02:25:55,141
uh,
you know,

2785
02:25:55,141 --> 02:25:56,640
I've been to,
I've been to New York,

2786
02:25:56,641 --> 02:25:57,870
I've been to boston,
I've been,

2787
02:25:57,900 --> 02:26:00,120
I've been,
I mean for visiting,

2788
02:26:00,121 --> 02:26:02,550
I've been a lot around,
but you know this,

2789
02:26:03,320 --> 02:26:04,153
the government is pretty tight there,
right about like internet usage and 

2790
02:26:06,591 --> 02:26:07,424
stuff.

2791
02:26:08,870 --> 02:26:10,830
I mean it's,
it's,

2792
02:26:10,920 --> 02:26:14,550
I guess porn does.
The only thing you can't use.

2793
02:26:17,290 --> 02:26:19,610
No wonder.
No wonder people.

2794
02:26:19,700 --> 02:26:20,920
I mean,
shit,

2795
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:24,390
that's why people watch your videos,
man.

2796
02:26:25,890 --> 02:26:28,920
It's the next best thing.
So when we see a combine,

2797
02:26:28,980 --> 02:26:30,790
I did this.
It's not a joke,

2798
02:26:32,850 --> 02:26:34,450
you know,
you get the urge,

2799
02:26:34,451 --> 02:26:36,790
you can open your eyes.
You'll.

2800
02:26:36,830 --> 02:26:37,663
So let me ask you this.
Are people in Saudi Arabia getting all 

2801
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:41,493
are,
do they jerk off to like this like you 

2802
02:26:42,941 --> 02:26:43,774
know,
or the video we made like the egg 

2803
02:26:44,381 --> 02:26:46,750
sandwich video.
Is that like good for.

2804
02:26:47,230 --> 02:26:50,920
That's the top search.
That's the good kid in Saudi Arabia.

2805
02:26:50,921 --> 02:26:51,754
Is that what people be at all?
But you probably used the h three but 

2806
02:26:58,761 --> 02:27:00,880
you use that.
You probably use a vpn,

2807
02:27:00,881 --> 02:27:02,500
right?
If you're trying to find some good shit.

2808
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:13,960
Let's be real.
I mean in terms of upn usage,

2809
02:27:13,970 --> 02:27:14,803
it's not even like hidden like people 
use vpn regularly because the thing is 

2810
02:27:19,281 --> 02:27:23,110
that it used to be the case that like,
stuff like whatsapp call is banned.

2811
02:27:23,230 --> 02:27:27,550
It's not that you can't call people,
it was only band because the,

2812
02:27:27,551 --> 02:27:29,170
the,
the main conglomerate,

2813
02:27:29,460 --> 02:27:31,300
uh,
didn't want competition.

2814
02:27:31,810 --> 02:27:35,470
They just want to people.
It wasn't even like a censorship type of

2815
02:27:35,471 --> 02:27:37,120
deal.
Just didn't want any company,

2816
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:40,780
but then they decided like let's just 
have a.

2817
02:27:40,781 --> 02:27:43,750
What's it called?
Like a competent competitive market.

2818
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:47,180
so you know,
just stay unblended and yeah.

2819
02:27:47,220 --> 02:27:48,053
What's up calls back?
That's a huge stride after a woman 

2820
02:27:50,441 --> 02:27:51,274
driving.

2821
02:27:53,610 --> 02:27:56,200
I use whatsapp all the time to call 
Israel.

2822
02:27:56,860 --> 02:28:01,860
I'm just imagining not porn.
I mean be.

2823
02:28:03,980 --> 02:28:04,813
I would definitely be on youtube.
There's some weird pornographic videos 

2824
02:28:07,751 --> 02:28:10,750
on youtube that we always make fun of.
I would be there naked yoga.

2825
02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:12,150
I just see.
I just need all the seat,

2826
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:12,993
a little bit of side boob and I'm coming
in my pants a little more sympathy for 

2827
02:28:15,911 --> 02:28:16,580
them.

2828
02:28:16,580 --> 02:28:17,330
Oh you got,
you got,

2829
02:28:17,330 --> 02:28:18,163
you got what's it?
There'll be frank and maximo doing 

2830
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:22,100
videos and you want us to look for

2831
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:23,450
the site?
That's enough.

2832
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:27,080
They don't overlap.
I need both.

2833
02:28:28,100 --> 02:28:30,710
Give be both.
What have we got?

2834
02:28:30,711 --> 02:28:31,830
A filthy frank w,
w,

2835
02:28:31,860 --> 02:28:32,930
w.
Would that be good?

2836
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,210
Come on into my pants at the thought of 
it.

2837
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:40,610
So what's your,
what do you want to plug your channel?

2838
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:42,680
Yeah,
you were just going to do it I think.

2839
02:28:43,690 --> 02:28:44,501
Uh,
okay.

2840
02:28:44,501 --> 02:28:45,334
So first of all,
my friends really insisted that I say 

2841
02:28:47,981 --> 02:28:48,814
this message,
so sophia gagliano supports and loves 

2842

2843
02:28:58,500 --> 02:28:59,333
sophia

2844
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:01,173
and then there's the uh,
based on my channel is called 

2845
02:29:04,370 --> 02:29:07,830
[inaudible] and it really,
if I.

2846
02:29:08,030 --> 02:29:09,620
Fs.
Yeah.

2847
02:29:10,570 --> 02:29:11,403
And the thing is.
and here's the thing before you guys 

2848
02:29:12,881 --> 02:29:14,320
close the call,
because I've been talking too much.

2849
02:29:14,321 --> 02:29:18,080
I know.
Basically the thing is I,

2850
02:29:18,081 --> 02:29:20,800
oh,
I posted one fortnight critical critical

2851
02:29:20,801 --> 02:29:23,470
analysis,
which sounds very juvenile,

2852
02:29:23,471 --> 02:29:24,304
but I mean I wanted to upload another 
video but I didn't get the chance quite 

2853
02:29:29,380 --> 02:29:32,040
a but it's coming up in a few days.
Whatever the hell it,

2854
02:29:32,070 --> 02:29:33,470
if that means anything.
Uh,

2855
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:35,770
but yeah,
you guys should follow it.

2856
02:29:35,890 --> 02:29:36,820
And uh,
yeah,

2857
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:39,780
that's my hustled.
I hope you guys have good stream.

2858
02:29:39,800 --> 02:29:40,250
I hope.

2859
02:29:40,250 --> 02:29:41,083
I wish we did have a great stream and I 
actually very appreciate you donating 

2860
02:29:46,691 --> 02:29:47,524
and calling it actually interesting to 
talk to somebody from Saudi Arabia to a 

2861
02:29:49,781 --> 02:29:50,980
fan from there.
That's very cool.

2862
02:29:52,320 --> 02:29:53,153
We still keep in touch.
We should keep in touch because I like 

2863
02:29:56,200 --> 02:29:57,033
that fresh perspective out there.
Although I don't know how much you can 

2864
02:29:59,471 --> 02:30:01,810
talk about,
but it's very fascinated to connect with

2865
02:30:01,811 --> 02:30:02,390
somebody

2866
02:30:02,390 --> 02:30:04,730

I'm just,
I'm just saying

2878
02:30:40,660 --> 02:30:41,493

There's a thing where I've gotten a lot 

2879
02:30:44,511 --> 02:30:46,130
of emails since we talked about it.
Yeah,

2880
02:30:46,131 --> 02:30:48,560
that was a popular discussion.
Encouraging it.

2881
02:30:48,561 --> 02:30:49,760
So.
And then,

2882
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:51,110
uh,
before I forget,

2883
02:30:51,170 --> 02:30:53,810
there was one other person,
not a call,

2884
02:30:53,811 --> 02:30:56,330
but just somebody that uh,
had donated a bunch of them.

2885
02:30:56,331 --> 02:30:57,164
We posit,
I think we actually did do the shout 

2886
02:30:59,181 --> 02:31:00,500
out,
but he emailed me and he,

2887
02:31:00,530 --> 02:31:04,040
he should missed it.
So shouT out to motivation app.

We've done it all.
We've seen it all.

2899
02:31:30,440 --> 02:31:33,740
We've been through the strikes,
the gutters altogether.

2900
02:31:33,770 --> 02:31:35,210

Beautiful thing.

2904
02:31:42,980 --> 02:31:45,500
it's all happened.
We've done it all.

2905
02:31:46,860 --> 02:31:51,010
If people watched it all,
I know they've stuck around,

2906
02:31:51,011 --> 02:31:52,180

02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:05,760
I'm committed to making a better to 
becoming a better interviewer,

2912
02:32:05,800 --> 02:32:07,900
a better host,
putting together better show.

2913
02:32:08,320 --> 02:32:11,680
It's been great.
It's been a real experience for us.

2914
02:32:11,681 --> 02:32:13,900
And next year,
2019,

2915
02:32:13,901 --> 02:32:15,880
we've got a lot of plans,
a lot of ambition.

2916
02:32:16,270 --> 02:32:21,190
Very excited tO get back into it.
I'm going to take a month to recharge.

2917
02:32:21,220 --> 02:32:23,500
We're going to be making a lot of h,
three h,

2918
02:32:23,501 --> 02:32:24,040
three videos.

2919
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:26,650
We're going to be focusing on that,
so tune in there.

2920
02:32:26,710 --> 02:32:29,200
I'm excited just to kind of focus on 
that for a little bit,

2921
02:32:29,201 --> 02:32:31,360
which is something we haven't done on a 
very long time.

2922
02:32:32,380 --> 02:32:34,240
We weren't excited about it for a long 
time.

2923
02:32:34,241 --> 02:32:35,860
Exactly.
And I am.

2924
02:32:35,861 --> 02:32:39,190
I'm feeling I'm feeling motivated to 
make videos there again for a while.

2925
02:32:39,850 --> 02:32:41,920
Um,
when we're back,

2926
02:32:41,921 --> 02:32:44,410
the first episode back is Michael 
Stevens.

2927
02:32:44,420 --> 02:32:46,870
Vsauce on the.
Correct me if I'm wrong,

2928
02:32:46,871 --> 02:32:51,010
dan,
the 21st or 25th of January 25.

2929
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:53,090
Um,
he's got a new car,

2930
02:32:53,140 --> 02:32:53,973
a season of minefield.
I'm sure we're going to have a ton of 

2931
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:58,630
stuff to talk about and the episode 
after that.

2932
02:32:58,631 --> 02:33:02,300
Want to get a furry in here in costume 
or too or too.

2933
02:33:02,350 --> 02:33:04,120
Yeah.
I've been seeing all your emails.

2934
02:33:04,290 --> 02:33:07,570
A furry community.
Dan's going to vet you guys.

2935
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:09,700
I'm,
I'm going to read through them all.

2936
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:11,620
We've been pretty buried with the 
charity stream,

2937
02:33:11,621 --> 02:33:12,820
but we're,
you know,

2938
02:33:12,870 --> 02:33:13,703
we,
we see you and we're going to work on 

2939
02:33:15,670 --> 02:33:16,503
engaging the furry community and I want 
to thank the community and everyone 

2940
02:33:20,951 --> 02:33:25,951
involved who rallied to raise so much 
money for people who so desperately need

2941
02:33:28,330 --> 02:33:28,720
it.

2942
02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:31,450
I'm so proud of you guys.
Proud of the community.

2943
02:33:31,740 --> 02:33:32,573
I just,
and I'm just so thankful and so much 

2944
02:33:34,421 --> 02:33:39,421
gratitude to as who stuck around through
thick and thin.

2945
02:33:42,070 --> 02:33:42,903
You know,
I've had a rough year of dead and I've 

2946
02:33:45,101 --> 02:33:45,934
done and said are a lot of stupid shit 
and some and I got a lot of shit for it 

2947
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:52,473
and you know,
it's tested me more than I've ever been 

2948
02:33:55,331 --> 02:34:00,331
tested in my life and I'm,
as kendrick lamar said,

2949
02:34:01,420 --> 02:34:03,580
you know,
when shit hits the fan,

2950
02:34:03,610 --> 02:34:05,640
are you feel bad,
you know,

2951
02:34:06,130 --> 02:34:07,600
and um,
some.

2952
02:34:07,690 --> 02:34:08,523
And you guys are still in a lot of 
people stuck around and fucked with us 

2953
02:34:12,281 --> 02:34:13,114
even in the worst of times.
So what more could you ask for than 

2954
02:34:16,571 --> 02:34:17,370
that?
Right.

2955
02:34:17,370 --> 02:34:20,920
[inaudible].
So I haven't been holidays.

2956
02:34:21,220 --> 02:34:23,080
Everyone.
Happy holidays.

2957
02:34:23,110 --> 02:34:24,670
Have a merry,
merry christmas.

2958
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,640
Whatever you're doing out there.
I am not,

2959
02:34:28,450 --> 02:34:29,520
I do not have a warrant.

2960
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:31,030
Christmas.
I'll say merry christmas.

2961
02:34:32,410 --> 02:34:34,690
Happy hanukkah and every goddamn,
every quanta.

2962
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:36,360
Does anyone celebrate kwanzaa?
I don't.

2963
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:38,230
They always say happy kwanzaa,
but I've never,

2964
02:34:38,260 --> 02:34:39,880
I've never known anyone to celebrate 
kwanzaa,

2965
02:34:39,881 --> 02:34:40,714
but I'm not discriminate.
I'm just saying I didn't know if they 

2966
02:34:42,851 --> 02:34:45,930
just throw that in there,
but happy kwanzaa,

2967
02:34:45,970 --> 02:34:47,560
you know,
everybody happy.

2968
02:34:47,561 --> 02:34:50,860
Whatever you ears.
God damn it.

2969
02:34:51,310 --> 02:34:52,900
Uh,
so we are going to be,

2970
02:34:54,700 --> 02:34:57,400
we're going to be going in there man.
H three time baby.

2971
02:34:58,150 --> 02:35:00,760
I'm excited and I,
I don't,

2972
02:35:00,761 --> 02:35:04,060
I don't know how to end this because I 
am so just so sincerely grateful.

2973
02:35:04,090 --> 02:35:08,230
And it's been a wild year.
It's been a wild year.

2974
02:35:08,260 --> 02:35:11,620
The longest year.
It's been the longest year ever.

2975
02:35:11,860 --> 02:35:16,240
Two thousand 18.
It's the longest year ever.

2976
02:35:17,950 --> 02:35:20,500
For me.
It was just pure for me.

2977
02:35:20,501 --> 02:35:21,334
Peer length of your.
I've heard a lot of people say that I 

2978
02:35:25,550 --> 02:35:27,280
feel both.
I feel like it's.

2979
02:35:27,310 --> 02:35:29,880
Well imagine it's long,
but it's also short,

2980
02:35:29,890 --> 02:35:31,480
like it's already december.
It's over.

2981
02:35:31,570 --> 02:35:32,880
Let me pay 19.
Yeah,

2982
02:35:32,890 --> 02:35:35,650
but let me put it in.
Let me put it in context for you.

2983
02:35:36,130 --> 02:35:36,963
Let me see.
what were we doing around the beginning 

2984
02:35:39,011 --> 02:35:40,900
of the year?
Let me tell you what episode we're doing

2985
02:35:40,901 --> 02:35:43,130
to kind of put it in context.
Um,

2986
02:35:43,480 --> 02:35:47,480
first one,
first one was a check and erica.

2987
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:50,710
Oh,
this year that was,

2988
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:52,570
we went to Israel to get.
Remember?

2989
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:56,470
That does seem like in 10 years ago.
Yeah.

2990
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:57,820
Oh,
in while you were in Israel,

2991
02:35:57,821 --> 02:36:02,160
the Logan Paul incident happened first 
aid for each video back.

2992
02:36:02,350 --> 02:36:04,390
Oh.
So it's weird.

2993
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:09,560
Some things feel short and things seem 
like it was a long time regardless,

2994
02:36:11,310 --> 02:36:13,960
you know,
it's been great.
