00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,743
Welcome

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,940
to the h three podcast experience.
How's that?

3
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,370
Pretty good periods.
We got super powers over.

4
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,910
This is a fucking experience.
I don't see Joe Rogan's podcast lighting

5
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:32,930
up with reverb and lightening bolts.
No,

6
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:34,890
no,
I'm good.

7
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,803
Thank you.
To Dollar Shave Club and Fort Night for 

8
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:43,380
sponsoring this episode of the podcast.
Guys.

9
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:48,381
We started late today because my day so 
far has been pretty messed up.

10
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,030
Oh my God,
Dude.

11
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,660
What happened?
So

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,690
having breakfast this morning,
you know,

13
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,830
getting ready for the day and um,
I see shredder on his little bed next to

14
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,534
the breakfast table,
a chewing on this weird little blue 

15
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:11,710
thing.
And I'm like,

16
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:13,540
what the hell is that?
What does,

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,310
what does,
what does shutter gotten himself into?

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,400
And he's like,
he's the pickiest eater in the world.

19
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:21,010
He doesn't eat anything but this little 
thing,

20
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:23,200
of course you eat this.
And I pick it up.

21
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:24,034
And what I ended up saying,
I thought it was like maybe a piece of 

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,793
detergent or something.
But what ended up being was a fricking 

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,333
adderall pill that was covered in 
plastic and he was like munch like 

24
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:41,960
halfway through it.
So I'm online looking up like,

25
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:42,890
what is this?
I'm like,

26
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:43,820
it's adderall.
Who,

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,960
who the hell left adderall on my floor.
So I call the vet,

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,300
the vet says call poison control,
poison control.

29
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,190
Well,
he's a little guy and the amount that he

30
00:01:55,191 --> 00:02:00,191
ate pretty much crosses right over the 
line of being toxic so to like,

31
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:03,924
you need to take him to the vet 
immediately and induce vomiting and 

32
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:11,130
shoved charcoal down his throat.
And I'm looking at this sweet little guy

33
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,090
by the way,
shredder.

34
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:16,320
Who's the light of my life besides you?

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,980
Yeah.
Whoops.

36
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,483
Um,

37
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,523
and,

38
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,281
and I'm like,
dude,

39
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,830
this guy is going to go through like the
craziest day.

40
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,710
They're going to go pump his stomach.
So I get in the car because he,

41
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:37,520
he seems fine.
He just basically ate a bunch of crack,

42
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,900
which,
what adderall is.

43
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,180
So I'm in the car driving on the way to 
the vet.

44
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:46,181
He seems fine at halfway there he starts
shaking and crying and he's confused.

45
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:51,470
He's like panicked and it's apparent 
that the drug had,

46
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,840
had started affecting him.
And um,

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,960
and I'm like crying because I'm so 
fricking scared.

48
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,890
My little guy and isla is out of the 
country,

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,710
out of the country with her family.
It's A.

50
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,720
Anyway,
we get to the vet.

51
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,010
He's fine.
They pumped his stomach.

52
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,330
He's fine.
He's a sweet little guy.

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,010
Point is.
Sorry I'm late.

54
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,850
My little guy almost went though.
I don't know if I can handle that.

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,260
Don't just break you man.
Well,

56
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,123
he.
I was talking to Eli about it and she's 

57
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,000
like,
if anything happened,

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,230
shredder,
I swear to God I.

59
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,440
I couldn't handle that.
She's like,

60
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,274
I couldn't handle it.
I know what I do because she's over 

61
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,640
there to take care of her.
Of her father who is sick right now.

62
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,830
Woo.
Anyway,

63
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:37,570
he's fine.
Yay.

64
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,820
But who walks around with an adderall 
and their pocket?

65
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,710
Just free flying.
Just free flying in the pocket.

66
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,640
Any small creature that comes across in 
the vet said when he puked,

67
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,680
they found the pill was blue and they 
found all these little blue specs like a

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,690
ton of the drug and his stomach.
She said it's a good thing.

69
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:02,440
You brought them right away because he 
puked it out and he.

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,270
He,
I think he would have died,

71
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,300
certainly if I didn't catch him eating 
it right away,

72
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:12,301
he would have died crazy.
So anyway,

73
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,400
so that's about that.
That's why we're late.

74
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,560
I don't know if that was an interesting 
story,

75
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,550
but um,
I was,

76
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,440
I was very upset,
but he's okay now and I'm also,

77
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:26,860
I'm the wizard of loneliness this week 
because Isla has gone.

78
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,100
She's back helping her family and I am 
truly the wizard of loneliness.

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,390
Shredder was gone with my parents the 
other day and I was just sitting there,

80
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,613
damn,

81
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,690
cast loneliness on myself.
Level 90 nine.

82
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,410
But anyway,
I'm here to entertain and that is what I

83
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:48,244
shall do next.
Friday is the great and wonderful Bo 

84
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,950
Burnham,
which were all super excited to meet and

85
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:57,850
chat with him and we're going to talk 
about his amazing film that's coming up.

86
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,080
Very excited about that,
but we've got a lot to get to today.

87
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:02,914
We've got the Tan of Khan Khan.
It took me a while to wrap my head 

88
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:11,011
around the icon thing.
This was like a rollercoaster of fraud.

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,313
The thing about Taneka,
and I've seen a lot of people talking 

90
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,564
about it,
the thing that Kinda surprised me most 

91
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:20,860
about it,
like I'm not a lawyer,

92
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:23,020
I have dealt with a lot of legal stuff 
though,

93
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,500
is that I'm like damn,
like they're off being like,

94
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,640
yeah,
I fucked up,

95
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,210
but a lot of people aren't acknowledging
that it seems to be criminal fraud,

96
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,463
like straight up,
like the FBI might want to say what up 

97
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,010
to her and a couple of weeks from now I 
want to get into that,

98
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:45,850
but first let's break the ice because 
I've got to clip.

99
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,710
That might be the best thing I've ever 
seen.

100
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,250
I'm just going to pop that up there.
Get the mood set,

101
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,340
get the feeling right,
man.

102
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,920
Being in the trenches solo was a fucking
brutal dude.

103
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,810
But here we go.

104
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,390
No sound.
There's no sound on this.

105
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,560
So this is.
There's no sound on this,

106
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:09,260
right,
Dan?

107
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,710
Yeah,
no,

108
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,543
no.
So basically what you're seeing is 

109
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,310
there's A.
I think they were shoplifting,

110
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,823
right?
They're shoplifting and they try to 

111
00:06:17,981 --> 00:06:21,490
escape as a police officer,
he brings her to the doubt.

112
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,380
He brings her down.
They're all kind of having a little orgy

113
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,640
there at the entrance,
kind of just tussling around,

114
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,480
so dude escapes from the police.
He's.

115
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,383
He's running into the storage,
the basically the back area where they 

116
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:37,540
store all the Saudi pops.
As you can see.

117
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,703
Now this video is so perfectly like shot
and set up and the twists and turns in 

118
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:45,340
it.
He's throwing halls at the officer.

119
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,620
The officer has a gun pointed at him.
What does he do?

120
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,080
He armed himself with a bag of halls.
Lawson.

121
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,100
Well,
I'm getting ahead of myself.

122
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,173
By the way,
these police officer pants are kind of 

123
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,950
Gucci's.
Fuck.

124
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,360
They got nice taping men.
The leg.

125
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,810
It's pretty stylish.
How did she escape?

126
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,063
This is in Canada by the way,
if you need to know if this was an 

127
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,374
America,
they'd be fucking bleeding dead on the 

128
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,140
floor.
It Ganada.

129
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,080
This girl's just wandering around.
You know what I mean?

130
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,140
There's two officers and she's still 
wandering around the store.

131
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,790
Anyway,
he's armed.

132
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,960
Oh,
little taser.

133
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:21,590
They're straight to the floor.
Did I miss the bat?

134
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,071
The.
Oh yeah.

135
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:25,250
Here this motherfucker arms himself 
with.

136
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,800
What does it say?
Spritz?

137
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,790
They look like a bag of peanuts.
Our son.

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,260
Here you go.
If you stay one step closer,

139
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,103
mad,
I'm going to hit you with this bag of 

140
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:41,384
peanuts.
His threats sadly did not avail as the 

141
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:50,710
officer was,
was better armed than him sadly.

142
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,860
So he's.
He's pretty much in submission,

143
00:07:53,861 --> 00:07:55,750
but nope,
he got a second wind folks.

144
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,160
He's got a second one and his,
his,

145
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,570
his wife is on the loose and he pushed 
through it says back the fuck off bitch

146
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,030
is what he said now I.
Yeah,

147
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,864
that,
that was a.

148
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,810
That was a real spill.
I've wondered if this video is fake,

149
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:18,660
but that's spill is real.
Folks.

150
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:21,100
Let me tell Ya.
That was.

151
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh,
he's got his.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,280
He's got his knee right on his fucking 
dick bone.

153
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,090
They're pretty.
So the girl has got a.

154
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,190
she's like,
Yo,

155
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,123
listen,
the cop just need my boyfriend in the 

156
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:35,770
deck.
He's probably impotent from now on.

157
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,830
So she's like,
I don't have any much use for this guy,

158
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:39,664
so I'm out of here.

159
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,713
Peace.

160
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,820
She tries to sneak out and that's true 
love folks.

161
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,730
She's like,
he's fucked.

162
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:48,564
I'm out of here.

163
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,813
Peace.

164
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,830
There's the bag of a spritz that was 
thrown at the officer.

165
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:56,910
Those already.
Those are evidence.

166
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,330
Now,
exhibit C,

167
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,760
did this guy,
man,

168
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,590
this officer,
this is like a real test for him.

169
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:09,360
Like how do you stop a meth head?

170
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,683
Okay.

171
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,410
In Canada it's a lot harder to,
to enforce the law when you don't have a

172
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:16,191
gun.
You know,

173
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:18,710
if this was America,
they would have just executed that guy.

174
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,843
He'd be done short video.
Kind of sad because instead of having 

175
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:24,614
like a wonderful,
almost three stooge asked video do 

176
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:28,824
enjoy,
it would just be like drugged homeless 

177
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:36,060
man was shot dead by Florida.
Me,

178
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,033
you know.
But instead we've got this wonderful 

179
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,010
little and it gets better.
Folks.

180
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:40,844
Stay tuned.

181
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,830
I love the effort by this officer 
though.

182
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:46,870
He's like,
you will not fucking escape me.

183
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:48,190
Meanwhile,
back at the ranch,

184
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,103
his,
uh,

185
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,010
his wife having decided to divorce him 
is looking for an escape room.

186
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,490
She goes to the ceiling,
desperation.

187
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,440
My God.
Now this is like,

188
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,333
Dude,
how the hell did they capture this so 

189
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:04,474
perfectly.
That's what makes me suspicious of it 

190
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:06,864
being faked.
Like even get the ass shot in there and 

191
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:11,350
the spandex and not saying that's 
something that interests me.

192
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,140
Just simply stating that it is quite an 
opportunistic shot.

193
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,850
Wow.
Where is she?

194
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,953
Where did she go?
Let's find out having a tussle and then 

195
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:28,120
suddenly look who's back.
That's right.

196
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,130
The girlfriend,
she's back.

197
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,280
She's back.
Ladies and gentlemen.

198
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,003
And aren't we so glad that the Canadian 
police force in this very moment aren't 

199
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:49,771
armed and we can enjoy this video she 
pops back up to.

200
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,220
It's just so beautiful.
She dude,

201
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,670
they must be dragged out of their mind 
because she just lives like,

202
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,560
shrugged it off like it's nothing.
Let's get it.

203
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,560
Let's get a.
let's get a slow.

204
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,113
Definitely.
Let's go to quarter speed on this one 

205
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,320
shelly.
So as you can see,

206
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:09,950
she's crawling around the attic space 
trying to look for an hour and um,

207
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,210
maybe maybe she had second doubts.
Maybe she said,

208
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:16,520
you know what?
I do Love A.

209
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,943
Oh,
you think she was trying to do like an 

210
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:19,920
aerial assault?
Yeah.

211
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,763
Here.
Yeah.

212
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,810
She's trying to help out but not quite,
not quite.

213
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,620
There's tennis balls rolling all over 
the place,

214
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,030
man.
She was just unharmed.

215
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,150
Whatever they're on,
I'll have one please Christ.

216
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,860
I could use a little invincibility and 
my life.

217
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:41,840
I could barely go up my stairs in the 
evening,

218
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,230
but be that as it may.
She's not wearing shoes either,

219
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:46,640
which I think is interesting to point 
out.

220
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:47,600
I know she is.
Well,

221
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:51,350
she's missing one shoe.
She is missing one shoe,

222
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:52,184
which is definitely worth pointing out.
I wonder if she's headed on over to the 

223
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:57,370
peanut bags to try to defend her 
boyfriend.

224
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,570
Stuck up on ammo stack up on ammo.
She's like,

225
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:03,910
listen,
I listen.

226
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:07,480
I don't know the guy.
I didn't do anything,

227
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:08,314
man.

228
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,583
Yeah.

229
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,460
Okay.
And then then,

230
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,330
then the real,
the real mf or show up and,

231
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,630
and put an end to this rodeo.
But wasn't that a thrill?

232
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,800
Wasn't that a thrill?
Ladies and gentlemen.

233
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,173
Truly a gift from Canada and I just 
really want to reflect one more time on 

234
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,820
an enjoy the fact that they are armed 
with tasers and not live.

235
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,841
Maybe they are,
I don't know,

236
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,610
but they didn't shoot him.
So cheers to that.

237
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,930
Yeah.
What a thrill.

238
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,490
It was a beautiful thing,
man.

239
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,470
It's like.
Do you see what I'm saying though?

240
00:12:46,471 --> 00:12:49,260
It's almost so perfectly arranged,
right?

241
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,700
That,
that I'm very.

242
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,980
I am so much suspicion,
but the way they eat shit,

243
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,180
you really can't fake that.
Right?

244
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:56,280
Like,
like how do you fake that?

245
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,630
That's a real spill for Shadi of fake 
that Shit.

246
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,830
She can't.
She,

247
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,693
she's,
she's takes back to school shopping 

248
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:10,011
sales very seriously.
That face when a,

249
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,370
that face when school papers 50 percent 
off me.

250
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:19,590
Once when school supplies or 50 percent 
off.

251
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,573
No.

252
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,383
Let's see.
That again.

253
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,180
Really can't get enough.
So one more for posterity.

254
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,570
This is totally me when I see that APM 
has a special on school supplies.

255
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,520
This is me watching that all weekend 
still cracks.

256
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,730
Well,
cheers to them.

257
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:47,200
You know what?
Nobody was hurt.

258
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,260
Nobody was murdered.
It was a beautiful.

259
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,333
Oh,
it's just every once in a while you get 

260
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,000
a video that's just so,
so perfect.

261
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,243
Hmm.

262
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,670
All right,
well now I got that out of the way.

263
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,340
We should move on to the Tan con.
Now.

264
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,550
I know a lot of you guys probably been 
following the Tanach on thing.

265
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,320
I think a lot of people have talked 
about it by now,

266
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:16,321
so I don't want to get too much into the
nitty gritty.

267
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:19,600
Honestly,
what I was trying to do,

268
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:20,434
because I was going through all this 
information last night and w and the 

269
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,383
preceding week,
we just understand like what the hell 

270
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:29,590
happened,
so I kind of have things bullet pointed.

271
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,550
We've got video clips,
I got pictures and I.

272
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,263
and I think there's,
there's a lot of interesting stuff in 

273
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:37,390
here,
but most,

274
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,540
most importantly.
Well let's,

275
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,600
let's start from the beginning.
Okay,

276
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:41,470
let's,
let's start here.

277
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,353
This is a riveting story by the way.
This whole thing is just absolutely 

278
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:50,500
fascinating and I haven't seen 
fascinating on a while and trust me when

279
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:53,230
I say that mean you see fascinating.
Fascinating too.

280
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,280
That up quick.
So she.

281
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,320
So tanner was pissed that vidcon 
heading,

282
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:00,020
given her featured creator badge in 
previous years,

283
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,543
so she wasn't having that.
So she decided to start her own 

284
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,010
convention that was inclusive for 
everyone.

285
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:13,990
That's what she kept pressing does that 
it was inclusive for everybody.

286
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:17,230
She sold these vip passes that said 
featured creators on them.

287
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,050
It's like what?
Every person there is a feature creator,

288
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,760
featured fucking creator actually would 
actually said,

289
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,643
fuck,
the actual official name is featured 

290
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:29,284
fucking Korean.

291
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,670
That is so fucking cool.
Um,

292
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,763
but it's like,
dude,

293
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,920
let's be real.
She sold 5,000

294
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,900
tickets and they are all featured 
creators.

295
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:42,734
Let's be real.
There's only one featured creator at 

296
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:46,470
Tana Con Stamina.

297
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,210
She wasn't there apparently.
Um,

298
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,153
so Tana decides to throw a con to rival 
vidcon with like 30 to 45 days to plan 

299
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:56,691
it.
All right,

300
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:57,524
so here,
here's the original invite from the 

301
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:00,774
production company called good times,
which a lot of good info about these 

302
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:05,924
boys.
But let's start with this welcome 

303
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:10,520
creators.
We are so thrilled for you to be part of

304
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:11,354
the first ever Taneka on good times as a
family that celebrates the online 

305
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,194
community.
We are so honored to be hosting this 

306
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,354
event.
We truly believe that each of you here 

307
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,963
is equipped,
are equipped with so many talents and 

308
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:25,520
passions to lead a revolution to one 
down,

309
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:26,640
Doug,
you're,

310
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,543
you're charging $65 for a VIP ticket.
There's not a revolution through the 

311
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,470
social media world that foster the 
vibrant,

312
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:36,210
inclusive and world changing 
environment.

313
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,510
I hate this whole sentiment of like 
everybody's a featured fucking creator.

314
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,953
You're all youtube superstars there.
It's actually really exploitive because 

315
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:46,874
you know,
every kid these days wants more than 

316
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:51,810
anything.
It'd be a utuber at my con.

317
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:56,400
Everybody's a featured fucking creator 
for $65.

318
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,503
This event is pioneering the change that
we are community wish to see in this 

319
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,160
industry.
Oh yeah,

320
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,090
we definitely need more,
more Tana cons.

321
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,890
We strive to make this a community where
everybody feels seen,

322
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:09,940
heard,
understood,

323
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:13,450
and most importantly included.
Don't they understand it?

324
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:16,790
In a world where everybody's included,
it's like you don't exist,

325
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,624
Tana,
when everybody's equal and everyone has 

326
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:23,800
the same talents and appeal,
it's like you don't exist.

327
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,390
It's so disingenuous.
Everyone is a featured fucking creator.

328
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,230
So with that being said,
fuck vidcon.

329
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,680
Fuck the current CEO,
is this voice working for you?

330
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:40,780
It was a cringy.
I mean,

331
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,360
it's no more grungier than her boys.
That's fact.

332
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,323
Everyone who created vidcon and if you 
want to know why Tannic comp became 

333
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,890
thing and that's why other love,
right?

334
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,750
This is a great genesis of like a great 
mission statement.

335
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,490
It's so phony,
dude.

336
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,450
It's the funniest shit ever.
You're all featured creators.

337
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,010
I gotta tell you,
I,

338
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,540
you've got probably noticed we don't 
really post videos on h three anymore.

339
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,860
I just,
I'm so like,

340
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,690
well,
there's a lot of reasons why were were,

341
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,520
but one of the big reasons,
just like,

342
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:18,240
man,
I just,

343
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,810
I really just can't watch everything on 
youtube.

344
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,740
It's just,
I don't know man.

345
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:24,580
It's all gotten.
So Tana,

346
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,820
it's like all Tana and people like her.
So,

347
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:31,500
um,
let me see what we got here.

348
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,660
Yes,
that's the window.

349
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,013
That's the floor.

350
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,463
What is this?

351
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,770
The dog?

352
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,160
I'm not sure what this significant of 
that one is.

353
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,830
What does this stand first of all from 
Shane's documentary documentaries?

354
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:52,730
A clip of her blog.
I think that video is just,

355
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,564
for some reason timestamp wrong.
Just go to the very beginning of that 

356
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,060
video and it,
it,

357
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,210
it's a nice little summary of her,
uh,

358
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,450
her mission statement,

359
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,483
all of the rebels people and all of the 
unwanted people should host a little 

360
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,124
meet and greet in Anaheim,
California on the same days as a bit 

361
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,480
gone.
I'd love to do it.

362
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,600
I would love

363
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:25,790
you all $65 to come to this rebellious 
little convention of ours,

364
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:27,923
which stick it to them.
We'll stick it to those capitalists at 

365
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:34,490
Vidcon.
It gets so good.

366
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,950
So anyway,
she's selling.

367
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,570
So what she actually pitches is that 
most of the tickets are going to be free

368
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,290
and there's only going to be a few VIP 
tickets.

369
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,124
What is essentially a free event?
People who buy VIP tickets get to skip 

370
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:50,714
the line.
They get three times worth the ticket 

371
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:58,301
price and a goody bag.
So the VIP tickets were $65.

372
00:19:58,941 --> 00:20:03,110
So essentially she's saying the goody 
bags can be worth about 200 bucks.

373
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,973
Okay.
So let's go ahead and look through the 

374
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:10,460
goody bag that the VIP people get.
And guys really stick around here.

375
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:13,970
So this,
this was the most prominent,

376
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
probably the most valuable item.
And there went the Fuck I paid $20 for a

377
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:19,970
condom.

378
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,510
The condom.
Oh yeah.

379
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:24,110
Seventy five guns.
Dyslexic.

380
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,173
So it looks like a,
it's kind of packaged like an after 

381
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,880
dinner mint.
You know,

382
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:34,070
what's the best part about them giving 
out condoms?

383
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,570
Is that everyone?
There's 12.

384
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,213
That's good.
But also imagine actually using this 

385
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,680
condom and then finding out that it 
doesn't,

386
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,140
it's not a real condom breaks.
You know what I mean?

387
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,230
Like is there a little disclaimer that's
like,

388
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,064
this is actually an after dinner mint 
packaging and not meant to conceal up 

389
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,130
something as important as a condom.
I wonder how many like uh,

390
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,993
unplanned births or,
or infectious diseases were passed 

391
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,230
thanks to her Tana condom by the way.
And it's so good that like con,

392
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,380
the Tan con,
it's just like,

393
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,180
so good.
Anyway,

394
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,253
that was the,
that was basically the highlight of the 

395
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:13,950
good of the $200.
Goodie bag.

396
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,090
Um,
here's a video of a girl on boxing.

397
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:18,924
Her Goodie bag

398
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,920
stickers.
Kida Kida.

399
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,540
Not from family guy.
Pete.

400
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,453
It's sounds sponsored by Jason Nash.
But he's nowhere to be found good 

401
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,600
princess,
but I can't afford that because I wasted

402
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:35,440
my money on a ticket.

403
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,860
Love it.
They included some broke ass.

404
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,210
Gucci Princess,
Ninety nine cent like wristband.

405
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,050
Like okay.
That's so Gucci Princess.

406
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:46,884
Do you think that any of these little 
girls spending $65 for a vip pass can 

407
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,480
afford Gucci?

408
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,883
Fuck,

409
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,540
I don't even know what this is.
Cozy free shopping guy.

410
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,263
Clearly it's just a bunch of garbage.
I mean it's essentially they basically 

411
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:08,340
put a bunch of shit in a bag and said,
well you throw this out for us.

412
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,370
So.
But it gets good folks here.

413
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:14,390
Let's,
let's keep going.

414
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,860
So the day of it's pure chaos outside.
Nobody gets into the convention,

415
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,380
which turns out to be,
by the way,

416
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,214
just a Marriott events room that has a 
maximum capacity of a thousand and the 

417
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:27,974
creators can't even get into the room 
because it's so unsafe because it's so 

418
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,680
chaotic and uncontrolled outside.
Carol,

419
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:36,280
let me give you a view of basically 
here.

420
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,150
Let's see.
This doesn't look.

421
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,840
So yeah,
you can see there's just like a winding.

422
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,720
It's like the whole parking lot.
I mean,

423
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:48,280
nobody can get inside.
No,

424
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,230
it's.
There's like 4,000

425
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:51,880
people outside or something like that.
Yeah,

426
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:57,390
so the funny part about basically this 
is that thousands of people are outside.

427
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:00,654
Okay.
And they're supposed to be a VIP ticket 

428
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:07,770
line for people who got the VIP ticket 
to skip in front of the free tickets.

429
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,933
But everybody out there who's waiting in
line for four to six hours in the 

430
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:15,030
blazing heat without any food or water 
being offered,

431
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,763
there's actually footage of ambulance 
and fire trucks coming and rescuing 

432
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:19,614
people from getting each stroke.
Everybody who's outside is starting to 

433
00:23:22,621 --> 00:23:23,454
realize

434
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:25,883
they all have a VIP ticket because it 
was pitched like mostly free and maybe 

435
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:32,774
like 300 vip for people who really care 
and want to make sure they meet 

436
00:23:35,511 --> 00:23:38,000
everyone.
So everybody out there,

437
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,070
they're starting realized has a VIP 
ticket.

438
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,493
Um,
they start claiming that there was 

439
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:51,170
20,000
people outside.

440
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,740
This is the genius that organized the 
event.

441
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,743
This fucking 20 year old.
I don't even know what to say about you 

442
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:05,690
did.
I can't really say anything honestly.

443
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:07,130
Can't say anything,
but what do you need to say?

444
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,043
What really do you need to say,
this is the guy that organized this 

445
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:11,654
event.
What really do you need to say about a 

446
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:13,544
guy like this?

447
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,653
Yup.

448
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,270
All as Dan affectionately put it,
the segway kid,

449
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:23,370
and this is just perfect.
This is.

450
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,850
This is the guy organizing the event.
This fucking guy with a scarf like,

451
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,770
oh yeah.
Once I put a scarf on,

452
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,380
everybody's going to know that this is 
under control.

453
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,130
Except you made a huge mistake.
You drove a fucking segway around,

454
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,993
dude.

455
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,013
God,

456
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,440
Gee Whiz,
man.

457
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,503
This is a guy in charge.
Something special about the scarf when 

458
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:51,910
it's like 95 degrees outside and people 
are passing out from heat stroke.

459
00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:52,780
Yeah,
totally.

460
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,633
Yeah,
exactly.

461
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,380
So they start gloating,
so it's,

462
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,300
it's chaos.
It's pandemonium outside.

463
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:00,730
Nobody can get in.
People are having heat stroke,

464
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,110
you know,
and they're start to.

465
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,610
Tana starts tweeting Shit like there's 
20,000

466
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:08,950
people outside.
We only 5,000

467
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:11,140
people were to show we're supposed to 
show up,

468
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,560
but there's 20,000,
15,000

469
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:15,394
unregistered guests showed up to the 
convention and that's why we have to 

470
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:23,530
shut it down here.
She says that Bella,

471
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,740
Bella and I are coming out to talk to 
everyone.

472
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,710
Everything is fine.
Just fire marshal stuff,

473
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:30,544
keeping it safe.
Maybe I won't do that voice adding a 

474
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:35,314
third day or if worse comes to worse,
I will be down to personally refund 

475
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,330
anyone who still upset,
no one expected.

476
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,830
20,000
people in my loves.

477
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,870
I love you.
So she's just like,

478
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,950
Eh,
no big deal.

479
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,750
20,000
people showed up.

480
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:47,584
Everyone understands.
But the thing is that the police report 

481
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:58,020
issued that same day says there was 
4,000,

482
00:25:58,151 --> 00:26:01,000
four to 5,000
people there at Max,

483
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,833
um,

484
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,590
four to 5,000
people at Max,

485
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:11,580
which turns out is the exact number of 
VIP tickets they sold.

486
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,743
So literally the same amount of people 
showed up as bought tickets and they're 

487
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:18,354
trying to paint it like 20,000
people showed up and that's why we're 

488
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:21,564
shutting it down.
But the truth is they oversold the 

489
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:27,630
convention with a 1000 seat capacity to 
5,000

490
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:30,060
people.
Here's the police report,

491
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:34,050
because Tana and his production company,
he kept trying to spin this narrative of

492
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,210
like so many people show up.
That's why we had to shut it down,

493
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,970
so here's the actual official police 
report.

494
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,223
Garden Grove Police Department officers 
were sent to Marriott suites to assist 

495
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:44,754
hotel staff and security with crowd 
control and dispersal of unruly hotel 

496
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:48,774
guests from the hotel property.
The tanach con convention was an event 

497
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:54,030
hosted by Tannic on company at the 
Marriott Suites Hotel.

498
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,480
The organizing group for Tenneco was a 
company called good times promotion.

499
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,373
Promotions event was scheduled to have 
meet and greet sessions between youtube 

500
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:01,854
celebrities in their fans.
There were concert concerts and dj 

501
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:09,180
scheduled reform for fans in the bar 
room starting at one or 10:00

502
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,790
AM.
10 ICAN had sold approximately 40,000

503
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:12,624
tickets at the time of the event.
The skip on down the hotel ballroom 

504
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,510
where the event was scheduled could hold
a maximum of 1000 people.

505
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,903
The organized planned the organizers 
plans to move the crowd in and out of 

506
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,580
the venue to allow all attendees the 
opportunity to participate in that.

507
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,713
As the crowd moved through the venue,
they were herded into the lobby after a 

508
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:35,760
short time to allow other fans into the 
ballroom.

509
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,820
People moved into the lobby.
We're upset and refuse to leave.

510
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,890
As the crowd grew in the lobby,
hotel staff and event security,

511
00:27:41,891 --> 00:27:44,340
you cannot gain compliance from the 
fans,

512
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,660
so they're like overflowing into the 
hotel lobby.

513
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,550
But essentially what's important is that
the police specifically state that there

514
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:57,500
was four to 5,000
people there,

515
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,920
approximately 20 officers and several 
supervisors responded to the scene.

516
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,473
Dude wasting the time of like 
essentially an entire police force to 

517
00:28:11,031 --> 00:28:11,864
disperse this absolute mess.
The police supervisors on scene to 

518
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:17,660
estimate the crowd was between four to 
5,000

519
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:19,910
social media sites.
Had the crowd was 20,000

520
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,880
and this was not accurate.
The police officers were made,

521
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,990
were able to disperse the crowd after 
approximately 60 to 90 minutes.

522
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,003
So there you go.
The exact amount of people showed up as 

523
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,710
tickets sold.
Uh,

524
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,080
who could have predicted?
Yeah.

525
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,960
Who,
who would have ever seen that coming?

526
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,030
This is the part.
Oh wait,

527
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,330
I want to show this one scene.
Yeah.

528
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,750
This,
this is really important seeing here,

529
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,870
but this is from Shane's documentary,
which he,

530
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,220
he did a lot of the leg work on this and
it's really good,

531
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,520
but this is footage they took while they
were planning David their con.

532
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,540
So here,
listen to this,

533
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,130
but obviously I haven't said it 50 to 
100 right now.

534
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,290
I love that.
For us,

535
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,780
I kind of just like set no capacity and 
they're just like,

536
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,633
okay,
we're going to sell out.

537
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,970
We sell now because I feel like there's 
a chance

538
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,890
everything about God,
I love that for us.

539
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,943
So he's like,
the hotel is set at a thousand but I 

540
00:29:26,351 --> 00:29:30,250
have it set at $5,200
and she bears witness to that and says I

541
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:31,084
love that for us,
which is basically conspiracy to commit 

542
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:35,974
fraud.
But there is straight up just 

543
00:29:38,171 --> 00:29:40,060
acknowledging that they're overselling 
the,

544
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,790
the event by 40,000
seats.

545
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,990
This is the part at the end of Shane's 
documentary where he's just like,

546
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:48,520
here's the,
here's the raw facts.

547
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,073
So here you go.

548
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,930
So I still had a lot of questions about 
pretty much everything.

549
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,510
So I called Michael and Michael's dad

550
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,473
the,
uh,

551
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,520
is the event organizers.
Yeah.

552
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,373
The segway kit,

553
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,480
that's the official number of VIP 
tickets sold was 5,108.

554
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,940
The number of free tickets was between 
two and 300

555
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,813
clusivity baby.
We just think that everybody's a 

556
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:21,570
featured fucking creator as long as you 
pay me $65.

557
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,690
I'm surprised 300 people get free 
tickets.

558
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,980
Claims that Tana knew that and that she 
was lying when she was at.

559
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,340
She still says she didn't.
The number of security guards,

560
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,473
was it never 91.
I got ahold of the contract and it said 

561
00:30:35,271 --> 00:30:36,104
that at most there was 25 security 
guards kind of put that in perspective 

562
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,820
for most conventions.
It's usually 50 guards per 5,000

563
00:30:43,821 --> 00:30:45,440
people.
So this was cut in half.

564
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,100
The amount of money spent on security 
was $60,000.

565
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,233
To put that in perspective,
the amount of money that they'd gone 

566
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:56,850
spend on security is $1,000,000,000.
This is the big one.

567
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,633
So I got ahold of the contract between 
the Marriott and good times and the 

568
00:31:01,581 --> 00:31:02,414
contract stated that there was only 
going to be 1000 people in Michael 

569
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,220
signed,
not Tana and Michael about this.

570
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:13,520
And they both said that yes,
the contract might've said it a thousand

571
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,353
dollars,
but everybody at Mary I've told them 

572
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:18,080
that that was just the safe number in 
that $5,000.

573
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,580
Okay.

574
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,100
Okay.
That's so stupid.

575
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,473
There's,
they literally had a room with a max 

576
00:31:23,861 --> 00:31:25,260
capacity.
You,

577
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,770
you've worked with like um,

578
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,350
with a lot of venues and stuff.
If they tell you,

579
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,100
oh yeah,
they're like,

580
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,100
it's a thousand maximum capacity,
but that's just no fucking way.

581
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:38,030
Are you kidding me?
No Way.

582
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,710
No way in hell.
That's real.

583
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,053
Just also.
But that's kind of a big fucking 

584
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:46,520
difference from 1000,
like maybe 1300 bucks,

585
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,420
100 over maybe.
But even then though,

586
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,600
they would never,
they would,

587
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,703
even,
if they would like turn a blind eye to 

588
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:53,624
it,
they would never say that because 

589
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:56,540
they're liable like that.
That's insane.

590
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,270
It's Marriott,
it's a huge corporation and not going to

591
00:31:59,271 --> 00:31:59,990
be like,
oh yeah,

592
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,950
5,000.
That's fine,

593
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,410
that's the part.
It's Mario,

594
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,263
it's not some amateurs,
small hotel and they don't give a fuck 

595
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:08,570
about Tana,
you know,

596
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,240
like they do.
They have events there every day.

597
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,070
It's,
this is just routine to them and there's

598
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:15,080
just no,
there's no way that's real.

599
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,303
I mean this,
this is the part that really gets like 

600
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,280
hearing saying the capacity is 1200.

601
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,270
Even if there was no issues,
no drama,

602
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,850
no whatever.
It wouldn't have worked.

603
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,660
There's no way that 5,000
people could fit there.

604
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,683
There is no way that 5,000
people would have had this wasn't gonna 

605
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,250
work,
but what is capacity

606
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:45,580
talk.
But obviously I haven't said it.

607
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:48,800
Fifty 200 right now.
I love that for us.

608
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,510
I also though capacity,

609
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,250
why she'd been looking there like a mom,
you know,

610
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:57,560
she's 20.
That blew me away.

611
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:03,250
She's 20.
She looks like she's going on her second

612
00:33:03,671 --> 00:33:04,504
marriage already.

613
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,451
Just like,
okay,

614
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:08,300
we're going to sell out.
We sell

615
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,560
coked out.
She was like rubbing or no,

616
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,510
I feel like there's a chance everything 
about this.

617
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,963
So anyway,
the thing that that really like just 

618
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,140
actually irks me about this is that 
Shane,

619
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,530
Shane did an amazing job on this 
documentary,

620
00:33:23,531 --> 00:33:26,150
like showing all this.
I mean he did not pull punches,

621
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,020
but in a way it is also a way for them 
to save face and be like,

622
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,630
we confronted it,
we talked about it,

623
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,960
but the truth is they straight up appear
to be committing a fraud.

624
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,650
They collected like $325,000
from these kids.

625
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,960
The convention,
by the way,

626
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:49,961
completely shut down like nobody got in.
And here's the great part.

627
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,850
Nobody's been refunded,

628
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,480
nobody's been refunded here.
Check out this press release.

629
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,560
Apparently this g,
the segway kid,

630
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:04,380
the genius in a contract he signed with 
this startup,

631
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:09,410
a ticketing company said that they will 
not issue refunds any,

632
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,743
any under any condition,
and the any refunds would be have to be 

633
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:19,290
handled by them directly.
It's a great policy.

634
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,630
It's fantastic.
And then here,

635
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,493
if you would,
we'll be issuing refunds to make a 

636
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:28,770
claim.
Please go to good times.live/claims

637
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:31,140
and fill out the form anytime before 
January fifth.

638
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,930
You should expect a refund within the 
next 30 days.

639
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,033
It's like Bro,
you gotta you gotta jump through hoops 

640
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,993
and pray that you get a refund,
but the worst part is like a lot of 

641
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:42,514
people flew there booked hotel rooms for
this and these guys are pretty much 

642
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:51,160
committed like a straight up criminal 
fraud.

643
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,623
I would not be surprised if the FBI 
police come knocking at their door and 

644
00:34:55,061 --> 00:35:00,061
like a couple of weeks.
So I don't know.

645
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,810
Yeah,
there's no way this is over for them.

646
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,880
I don't think so.
They're in deep shit.

647
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,743
Yeah.
There's some great little details here 

648
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:09,164
to like the same night that that all 
went down and the convention was closed 

649
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:16,280
and everyone was losing their minds.

650
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,210
Walking from venue to venue crying,
trying to find something else.

651
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,330
Is that the

652
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,770
11:00
PM?

653
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,720
We're still calling venues.
It's 2:00

654
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,400
AM.
We're still calling.

655
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,740
You know,
Martina asked 71 party.

656
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,470
Look at this.
This is her that evening.

657
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,470
Sure.
What do you want to do?

658
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,460
Do you want to.
Okay,

659
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,380
thanks for your $65

660
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,140
anyway.
So why bother?

661
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,930
You know,
what really shocked me the most,

662
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,793
because you know,
this girl Bella Thorne that she's 

663
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:59,140
friends with,
they're both 20 dude.

664
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,320
That's more mind blowing than even the 
fraud itself.

665
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,210
Those girls and I,
I don't know if this comes off road,

666
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,610
it might,
but.

667
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,583
And they're,
those girls have a lot of mileage on 

668
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:14,560
them.
They're like 20 going on 30,

669
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:15,394
like Holy Shit.
And I'm not saying that like Bella 

670
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,343
Thorne isn't attractive.
I'm just saying she needs her oil 

671
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:26,971
changed at this point.
I'm 20 years old.

672
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,930
I think she looks good.
She looks good.

673
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:34,390
It just looks like she's.
She just washed out of the sea.

674
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,980
Tana.
Oh my.

675
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,950
I don't know.
I just shocked that she's 20.

676
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,460
I'm not saying that they're ugly or 
anything.

677
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,533
Just God damn.
Well that explains a lot about all of 

678
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:46,271
this.
And I believe,

679
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:47,590
uh,
the Michael Kidd,

680
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:48,670
the segway kid.
He,

681
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,760
he's also 20 or maybe 21.
What happened is a bunch of children.

682
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,670
Yeah.
What happens when a bunch of 20 year old

683
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,520
pseudo celebrities try to organize a 
convention?

684
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,800
Here it is.
You get a little fraud,

685
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,770
a little unplanned pregnancy.
A couple of,

686
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:07,970
uh,
stds.

687
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,640
Have you ever had a condom break on you,
Dan?

688
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,950
I have actually.
Yeah.

689
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,500
That's scary.
That's a bad feeling.

690
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,830
A lot of people are going to be busting 
through those.

691
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:24,550
Did breaking through a con.
It's one of the worst things ever.

692
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:29,551
I remember the first time I had sex and 
the condom broke the first time.

693
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,510
The very first shit.
And you're like,

694
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,710
oh shit.
You're like,

695
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,210
this is a good condom.
You're like,

696
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:37,810
this is a really good condom.
Damn.

697
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:39,520
What's this brand again?
Damn baby.

698
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:40,690
What's this brand?
Oh,

699
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,680
it's a Tan AECON brand.
Like,

700
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,440
Oh shit.
Oh Shit.

701
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:49,150
Do you have to plan B it?
Beat it,

702
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,020
beat it.
The time the condom broke.

703
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,420
That was the one time.
Yeah.

704
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,113
Tana contract probably have included a 
low plan being her goodie bag just in 

705
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:01,960
case I needed a plan B for this 
convention.

706
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,090
Her parents needed a plan B if I'm being
honest.

707
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,050
Yikes.
So anyway,

708
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,083
it turns out the con and Tana con as has
a double meaning in this casing as both 

709
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:17,644
a convention and a literal con.
So I have a couple of bonus clips for 

710
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:23,800
you guys.
There's really nothing to say,

711
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,930
but I felt stupid even talking about it.
Honestly.

712
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,073
It's,
it's fascinating in that it was such a 

713
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:30,334
train wreck and presumably they put this
event together almost without even a 

714
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:39,820
thought to what would actually happen 
the day of,

715
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,050
you know what I mean,
like so irresponsible that sent 5,000

716
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:47,284
fucking people and almost a not even 
like they thought as long as I booked 

717
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:53,440
the room,
it's like,

718
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:54,820
you know,
if you build it,

719
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:59,821
they will come.
That was a movie you need.

720
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,650
You need another audience out there.
Yeah.

721
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:03,300
I don't know.
You need.

722
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,840
Anyway.
It was just like mind numbingly insane.

723
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,683
Um,
would not be surprised if a week we see 

724
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:13,670
some jail time for them.
If I'm being.

725
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,090
And I'm,
and I swear to God,

726
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:15,924
I'm being honest.

727
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,490
We're not.
Be surprised.

728
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,073
Well the big thing is this Michael Guy,
at least according to Shane's 

729
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,913
documentary,
he signed on the dotted line for 

730
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,640
everything.
Yeah.

731
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:28,390
But.
So He's,

732
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:32,620
he's definitely fucked.
The thing is,

733
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,593
I think she,
that one clip alone proves that she has 

734
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:39,700
like a conspiracy to commit fraud.
I love that.

735
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:42,100
For us,
that is going to play in a courtroom.

736
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,580
There's going to be a judge and a jury 
at watching 10 ago.

737
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,360
I love that for us,
and then the judge is going to be like,

738
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:53,320
you know what?
I love for you five to 10 years.

739
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,650
I'm trying to think of a good plan where
I'm trying to.

740
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,220
You know what I love for you Tana?
Sixty five months.

741
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,610
One month for every dollar for your VIP 
ticket.

742
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,190
By the way,
bonus.

743
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,560
In my research I found some.
She's either.

744
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,850
Why does she exist?
Why is she popular?

745
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,410
Hey guys,
it's Tana.

746
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,990
You know what's so stupid about like 
youtube,

747
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,550
like she like they complete.
I haven't ran about too,

748
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,090
but I don't fucking.
I don't give a shit.

749
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,143
Why is it that Youtube will not even bat
an eye at me or dubs or any of my 

750
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:33,670
friends that actually have.
I'm not going to say they have talent.

751
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:34,803
They deserve shows.
What the fuck is it always Tana and 

752
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:41,860
people like her who are actually not 
only the lowest character,

753
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,840
but frankly criminals

754
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,470
that,
that get youtube red series.

755
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:48,890
Like there was a,
um,

756
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:54,570
she was featured in this.
Joey got fucking dog at show is so dumb.

757
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,390
The haunted house show God.
Have you.

758
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:11,070
Have you ever seen anything dahmer?
I,

759
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:17,661
I dare you to watch this shit.
And A,

760
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:21,440
and in a way youtube is enabling them 
to,

761
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:23,060
it'd be like,
you are stars.

762
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,393
So they're running ads for Tanna.
I've got this add a bunch of times 

763
00:41:28,161 --> 00:41:28,994
because she's premiered in the new 
season of Joe are Cephas fucking shitty 

764
00:41:35,501 --> 00:41:37,300
house.
And it says,

765
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,223
do you love Tana?
Like Youtube is actually running ads 

766
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:46,320
promoting this,
this mom.

767
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,071
I say,
mom,

768
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:50,904
because like I said,
it looks like she's going on her second 

769
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:53,034
marriage.
She looks like a mom that doesn't spend 

770
00:41:54,421 --> 00:41:55,920
a lot of time with their kids.
You know what I mean?

771
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,040
She looks like a mom who's out at 3:00
AM,

772
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:02,190
partying and grandma takes care of the 
kids.

773
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,680
You know what I mean?
Does she not look like that?

774
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,443
They should not look like this.
The odometer is just about to hit 

775
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,710
100,000,

776
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,000
you know,
the check engine light is on.

777
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,933
So anyway,
and somehow I'm unendorsed bubble or 

778
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:27,900
like my friends who,
who,

779
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,530
who I respect to my great content.
Probably the best on youtube.

780
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,760
They're unendorsed but somehow.
But anyway,

781
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,470
so I'm,
I'm on her vlog channel,

782
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,090
right?
This is her trailer,

783
00:42:39,091 --> 00:42:41,190
Bro.
Watch this.

784
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:46,191
This is her trailer watch in a few 
hours.

785
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:50,730
Hunter and I just took some adderall.
No,

786
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:52,620
we did not.
Can you not say that?

787
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,463
No,
I didn't think that's her fucking first 

788
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,453
message to her fans.
This 20 year old with these little 

789
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:03,363
girlfriends.
Her first thing she wants you to know 

790
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:08,400
about her is that she just took drugs 
illegally.

791
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,820
I just took adderall.
Can I not say that?

792
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,570
She's probably the one that left it on 
the floor and two boys and shredder.

793
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,970
Oh,
interesting.

794
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,640
She got wind that we were doing this 
today.

795
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,100
Preemptive strike.
Let's give Tana a show on youtube.

796
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:31,101
Red called how called how to be damaged 
goods by the age of 22.

797
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,240
Let's,
let's give Tana a show a reality show on

798
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:41,074
youtube.
Red called how to poison the minds of 

799
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:50,500
the young generation under the guise of 
family friendly content.

800
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,720
Her a show.
Let's do it.

801
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:56,860
Oh,
oh.

802
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,230
But kids like her.
Let's give her a shill.

803
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,410
Kids watch her.
Okay.

804
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,313
She's in.
I just took adderall and I sprinkled it 

805
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:08,200
on.
Ethan's Florida poison his dog.

806
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,433
Um,

807
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,560
I lost track of time.
How long have you been with Stanford for

808
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:19,210
break?
I have one more.

809
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,900
I have one more clip.
All right.

810
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,650
Um,
his clips.

811
00:44:22,651 --> 00:44:24,730
Not that important.
Let's go to the break.

812
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,580
All right.
I got worked up.

813
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:29,440
I need to go.
Cool off guys.

814
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,300
We've got a commercial and after that 
we've got a lot to get to,

815
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:37,560
including we've got prank calls that 
somebody did with my voice.

816
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,160
Someone made a soundboard.
Blind voice.

817
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,383
We've got.
I want to talk about the KSI versus 

818
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,770
Logan.
Paul fight so much more.

819
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,990
Oh,
see you guys soon.

820
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,970
Electric toothbrush.
Legend has it.

821
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:07,220
This toothbrush fell from the sky on the
eve of Jesus's birth.

822
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:11,270
Christmas Day.
The shot from the sky like immediate.

823
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,830
Right?
But it was not destroyed.

824
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,900
Quip is the best toothbrush ever 
invented by a mortal man.

825
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,890
But the toothbrush itself is immortal.
Here's what it does.

826
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,050
It's electric.
It's slick,

827
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,250
it's handy,

828
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,790
it vibrates,
but it's just a little guy.

829
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:31,893
And guess what?
It only costs you about 25 bucks to get 

830
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:38,020
started with an electric toothbrush.
You put it in,

831
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:41,560
it vibrates a cleaned your teeth.
It's got a nice soft bristle,

832
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,040
unlike any other toothbrush.
I'm telling you folks,

833
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,920
do you listen to?
The angels are crying.

834
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,083
They're not singing,
they're crying because this is a 

835
00:45:51,701 --> 00:45:55,200
miracle.
That's why it's on Oprah's O,

836
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,480
o list.
Nobody just gets on Oprah's list.

837
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:05,230
Here's what it does.
It vibrates and it pulsates,

838
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:08,860
and it tells you when to switch to the 
bottom side.

839
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,620
At times you you're supposed to brush 
for three minutes.

840
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,260
I bet you don't get sick.
Nasty freak.

841
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,510
Your mouth stinks.
Not Anymore.

842
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,321
Brush,
brush,

843
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:18,520
brush,
vibrates.

844
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:19,540
Switch,
brush,

845
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:20,374
brush,
brush.

846
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,620
All the sudden you're done.
You brushed enough.

847
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,440
Your gums are healthy,
your mouth is glowing,

848
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,860
your breath is incredible.
And those angels that are crying for you

849

right now,
they're gonna.

850
00:46:32,051 --> 00:46:35,920
Be crying for the nice smell in your 
mouth because finally,

851
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:40,150
a girl's not going to have to smell your
stinky breath and that makes angels cry.

852
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:44,140
Enjoy.

00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:16,230
You hear that?
That's the sound of a swab.

860
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:21,231
Asked Dollar Shave Club using dude 
walking down the street looking clean.

861
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,830
He's radiant,
he's clean shave.

862
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:24,664
He smells good.
And everybody who walks by and says to 

863
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:30,190
themselves,
I want to suck that guy's Dick.

864
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,680
That's right.
Dollar Shave Club folks.

865
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:36,340
Dollar Shave Club delivers everything 
you need to look,

866
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:38,500
feel and smell your very best.
You name it.

867
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:40,420
Shampoo,
conditioner,

868
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,950
body wash,
toothpaste,

869
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:42,460
hair,
Gel.

870
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,780
Even a wipe that will leave your Tush 
theone,

871
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,110
Tingley and clean.
And let me tell you folks,

872
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,300
when they say Tingley,
they mean it,

873
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,280
and I mean that in the best way 
possible.

874
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:52,623
You want your anal hole tanglin.
I'm a big fan of their amber and 

875
00:47:56,501 --> 00:48:00,370
lavender calming body wash.
This body wash is incredible.

876
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,310
Have you ever rolled through a field of 
lavender?

877
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,233
Well,
it's thorny and it's awful and I 

878
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:06,880
wouldn't recommend it,
but with the soap,

879
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
you get that beautiful smell without 
having to run through a bunch of brush.

880
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,760
It smells amazing.
It's a beautiful thing.

881
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,300
Good luck.
Finding a product like that in the store

882
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,153
probably costs you five to $6,000.
All of dollar shave club products are

the.
They're amazing,

890
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:46,480
but wipes that we talked about at the 
tingling sensation on the anal hole.

891
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,483
I don't want say anal,
the anus anusol as much sexier than 

892
00:48:51,851 --> 00:48:56,560
Anna's folks and of course the world

What the hell are you doing with your 

911
00:50:03,471 --> 00:50:06,380
life?
This game is a phenomenon.

912
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:07,580
Taking the.
It's probably,

913
00:50:07,581 --> 00:50:08,810
I think,
I'm not sure,

914
00:50:08,811 --> 00:50:09,644
but it's probably.
I think it's the most popular game ever 

915
00:50:11,181 --> 00:50:16,181
made the most active players.
There's 125 million players.

916
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:17,743
That's insane.
That's like half the continental United 

917
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:22,400
States.
You guys get on there.

918
00:50:22,401 --> 00:50:23,234
You might match up against Ninja.
You know the world famous East Sports 

919
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,990
Gamer that's taken world by storm.
Here's some gameplay right here.

920
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:34,460
This could be you right now for night is
a pvp of 100 players,

921
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:36,680
distractible environment,
buildable structures,

922
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:39,320
and you can play with your friends and 
duos and squads.

923
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:43,850
They are consistently releasing new 
content and cool new features every day.

924
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,133
That's true.
This game is always evolving and being 

925
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,350
updated.
The developers care so much.

926
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:49,790
Such a great,
polished,

927
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:53,090
fun experience of a game.
There's a reason it's so popular,

928
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,120
folks.
It's because it's freaking awesome.

929
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,970
It's like the best genre,
the battle,

930
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,223
the battle royale meets the best 
developers who have completely polished 

931
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:04,064
it,
are putting so much love and care into 

932
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:06,884
it every day.
What's not to love and here's the 

933
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:10,400
craziest,
trippy as part.

934
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,540
It's free.
It's 100 percent free to play.

935
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:16,340
Yeah,
I know.

936
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,680
It's insane.
For nights constantly.

937
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:22,760
Did you guys know that season five is 
right around the corner?

938
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,040
Did you see the rocket that was launched
last week?

939
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:29,360
I wonder what that's all about.
There's a rocket.

940
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:33,920
You better sign up to play.
Make sure you guys jump in before season

941
00:51:33,921 --> 00:51:38,921
five starts on July twelfth and it's 
available on almost every platform.

942
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:41,090
I'm talking Ios,
PC,

943
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:42,410
Mac,
playstation four,

944
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:43,640
xbox one,
and switch.

945
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,533
And guys,
if I can't sing praises anymore about 

946
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,193
fortnight,
it's freaking cross play like what game 

947
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:52,550
has ever achieved?
Actual Cross play.

948
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,073
The meaning that if you're on your pc,
you could play with somebody on on the 

949
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:57,680
playstation four.

950
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:06,270
What a click the link in the description
guys,

951
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:09,970
to see what the hype is all about.
Play.

952
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:14,260
Fight fortnight for free.
So go to Lincoln description.

953
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,191
Give it a shot.
I mean,

954
00:52:15,191 --> 00:52:16,840
what do you got to lose?
Try play for an hour.

955
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:18,270
See if you like it.
If not deleted,

956
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,510
it's free.
What do you have to lose?

957
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,000
Thank you for it and I appreciate you.
Let's get back into it.

958
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:28,580
Welcome to the experience.
Can I get some lightning bolts?

959
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,970
Joe Rogan step off,
bitch.

960
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:36,953
That's right.
You think I could take Joe Rogan and an 

961
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,360
arm wrestling match?
Do you want a real answer?

962
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,080
Does he have lightening bolts stand yes 
or no?

963
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,010
As far as I know.
No.

964
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,780
So probably the same answer as if I 
didn't know.

965
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,970
I didn't know lightning was allowed in 
an unprecedented.

966
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,210
I mean if it is,
then you got it in the bag.

967
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,420
No problem.
Alright,

968
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,290
easy.
Um,

969
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,080
let's get it here.
Just like the,

970
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:04,914
uh,
just like the store we saw experience 

971
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:13,783
that feels good.
Just like the clip we saw earlier of 

972
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:18,920
these Canadian crackheads falling 
through the roof.

973
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,110
There's another great one that I want to
throw up here.

974
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,020
This Guy Lou Walsh.
Okay.

975
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,930
You creepy fucking loony tune.
This was a clip.

976
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:32,931
I guess it happened several years ago.
Lou Welsh from thex factor.

977
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,400
I mean we're all talking about like me 
too and all this shit.

978
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:37,020
Like if you,
if you blink,

979
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,920
if you blink wrong at a girl,
you're going to be deposed.

980
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,333
Ethan answered truthfully.
Did you look from the peripheral vision 

981
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,150
down?
Uh,

982
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:50,003
her skirt down her or low cut top.
The camera caught your pupils looking 

983
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,690
slightly to the left.
Okay.

984
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,650
And this world,
I don't know if that's a good example of

985
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:03,790
whatever.
Do you guys,

986
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,560
do you ever look at girls through your 
peripheral vision?

987
00:54:05,561 --> 00:54:06,580
Dan,
do you like this?

988
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,070
I don't think any guys pretty tricky.
Oh yeah.

989
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:12,120
I mean that's.
You do that.

990
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,103
I've never,
I don't know that I can't say I've ever 

991
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:16,830
done this.
Really?

992
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,760
You've never come on.
You see that ground in anyway.

993
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,590
I think you already went to sleep.
You can.

994
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,290
You can tell the truth.
I've never,

995
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,400
I don't.
But I'll tell you.

996
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:32,370
Who Does Lou Walsh look at this fucking 
Sicko

997
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,620
got today.
She makes now she knows she's.

998
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:38,223
Yeah.
It's not the same show that Ryan 

999
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:45,741
seacrest was a fuck is wrong.

1000
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,590
All right,
well she's clearly discuss it.

1001
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:59,940
She's not kidding around it.
How the hell did nothing come from this?

1002
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,310
Like this clip resurfaced recently of 
him.

1003
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:03,810
Basically,
and by the way,

1004
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:06,540
why do you have to do it live on 
television?

1005
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,900
Is that somehow like the end,
the lion's den theory,

1006
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:12,670
right?
Like safest and in plain sight.

1007
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,120
Yeah.
Maybe the other might be kind of like,

1008
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:18,120
who's going to say something?
To me that's like the secrets thing too,

1009
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:20,400
when he approaches Katy Perry,
it's like,

1010
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:21,234
why the fuck are you going to make these
creepy comments to her right before you 

1011
00:55:24,331 --> 00:55:26,790
come live?
Because it's almost like the safest time

1012
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:27,624
to do it,
right?

1013
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,100
Because they don't want to,
you know,

1014
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,710
they're going to cause a scene by 
getting upset by it.

1015
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:32,933
You know,

1016
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,350
it's not embarrassing.

1017
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,650
What is wrong with you?
Like,

1018
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,960
what is it?
It's clearly not sexual satisfication.

1019
00:55:46,961 --> 00:55:49,090
It really is almost like a power play.
Totally.

1020
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,520
Explain what's going on for the,
uh,

1021
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,680
for the audio listeners.
Oh,

1022
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,760
well,
yeah.

1023
00:55:54,761 --> 00:55:55,660
Oh yeah.
Them,

1024
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:56,803
they felt while he's sitting on a couch,
it during the live broadcast has of the 

1025
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:02,830
x factor.
He's got his hand on the cohost ass.

1026
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,650
He squeezing it and patting it live on 
TV.

1027
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:08,860
She's getting noticeably irritated.
And she finally says,

1028
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:09,820
basically,
what are you

1029
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,833
here?

1030
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:16,063
I still have a job.
Like that's a creepy shit I ever seen 

1031
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:17,791
him.
By the way,

1032
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,330
why is this guy looked like a fucking 
baby bites his face looked like a little

1033
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:22,164
child that never aged.
Just be like his skin degenerated like 

1034
00:56:25,061 --> 00:56:26,410
he aged,
but he never grew up.

1035
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:28,510
That's you,
Lou Walsh.

1036
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,050
Shitload of Botox,
right?

1037
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,430
Probably a lot of children's for skin.
You know,

1038
00:56:36,431 --> 00:56:39,160
they say children's for skin is the most
regenerative.

1039
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,820
A potent,
you know,

1040
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:42,040
cosmetic.
He probably.

1041
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,400
They say that.
Actually I'm not.

1042
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,020
I'm not kidding that shit.
No,

1043
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,140
I swear to God,
but I'll tell you.

1044
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,720
Lou Walsh,
this is a powerful man.

1045
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,460
He's got a lot of money.
He's got the.

1046
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:59,260
He's got the literal face of a child.
You probably has baby for skin factory.

1047
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,160
You know how they like a farm silk.
This guy farms for skinny.

1048
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:03,994
He's probably got babies on chains and 
he and they've got super regenerative 

1049
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:08,560
for skin.

1050
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:13,300
They're like a new breed.
And they got super regenerative for skin

1051
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:17,290
that he just snips and rubs.
He actually what?

1052
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:18,880
He rubs his shoe.
The shoe magma,

1053
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:19,953
not actually the force can buttons.
This magma is the residue and dirt that 

1054
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,300
collects when you don't clean inside the
force gun.

1055
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,130
The other problem I have because I'm 
Jewish,

1056
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,233
but he probably does rub that magma 
oliver his fucking face and that's why 

1057
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:32,914
it looks like that.
That's why it looks like a 50 year old 

1058
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,433
gerber baby.
I always hated that guy's face added 

1059
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,270
even more know what a piece of shit and 
he's like,

1060
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:47,110
he's doing the groping and then like the
moment where she finally reacts.

1061
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,210
He's just like jiggling it.
Like he's just like,

1062
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:55,150
it's a man's world baby.
Why is this guy still have a job?

1063
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,870
That's my question because I found this 
clip and it just resurface.

1064
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:59,860
I was like,
Holy Shit,

1065
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:03,430
this is like really bad and I'm looking 
at.

1066
00:58:03,431 --> 00:58:06,830
I'm looking and I'm trying to find any 
evidence of,

1067
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,300
of him being reprimanded for this and 
there's nothing there.

1068
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:11,470
Nothing happened.
Nothing.

1069
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,930
We need to.
We need to go to his home.

1070
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:19,360
When he to look in his basement,
you know that there's like giant bottles

1071
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:24,481
of milk and these super regenerative 
force can babies in his basement.

1072
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:30,370
He selling these two Chinese patrons,
they used them as Viagra.

1073
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,613
The Chinese will do anything to help 
stimulate their sex and you know I'm 

1074
00:58:35,651 --> 00:58:36,484
right.
All the fuckers straight up kill 

1075
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:38,434
endangered species,
Rhino Horn baby to to help get their 

1076
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:43,300
dick hard.
It doesn't work by the way,

1077
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:47,840
but they still kill them all and I'm 
sure you tried it until you try it.

1078
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,180
I Rhino Horn.
Well,

1079
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:50,014
as far as I can tell,
there is no medical value and ground up 

1080
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,980
toenails,
which is basically what it is.

1081
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,530
But I love that.
The Chinese to go on a little tangent,

1082
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:58,730
it's like you know that there's Viagara 
right?

1083
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,410
You don't have to go fucking kill 
endangered species anymore.

1084
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:03,363
And Lou Walsh,
it's time to just age with grace and 

1085
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:11,221
shut down the baby force can factory.
This guy pisses me off,

1086
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:13,720
man.
It's pretty gross.

1087
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,870
When was this?
This is like some,

1088
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,780
you know that scarf.
You seen his vest pocket.

1089
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:24,320
That's his fucking jerk off rag.
He's such a Weirdo.

1090
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:26,090
He probably goes to the bathroom during 
the break.

1091
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,220
Jerks and do is rack,
puts it back in his pocket.

1092
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:31,670
He probably does weird shit like makes 
her smell it without telling her.

1093
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,950
He goes eight falls out of his bag.
He's like,

1094
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,120
oh,
can you pick that up for me?

1095
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:37,760
Because he gets off and knowing that she
touched his comrades.

1096
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,140
Jesus Christ,
man.

1097
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,640
He's a Sicko.
It's not man.

1098
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,050
Fuck this guy.
Fuck this guy.

1099
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:48,853
Yeah,
I guess this was.

1100
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,680
This is pretty.
Pretty Harvey.

1101
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,383
Pretty hard to get away with this.
We're in a post harvey world and I just 

1102
00:59:55,961 --> 00:59:59,470
saw this video man and I gotTa tell you 
I did not like it.

1103
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,470
This is the same show that like.
See Chris Scott and we're in.

1104
01:00:02,471 --> 01:00:03,580
We're in trouble over though,
right?

1105
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,660
Without America.
No,

1106
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:07,150
that's all circling around.
Simon.

1107
01:00:07,151 --> 01:00:11,500
Cow Cow.
He is the epicenter.

1108
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:14,140
Simon cows up to some weird shit.
By the way,

1109
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:18,730
baby for screen is just the beginning 
with Simon cowl.

1110
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,060
That's just the tip of the Dick.

1111
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,450
Simon cow.
What does he do?

1112
01:00:25,451 --> 01:00:26,284
You know?
These rich billionaires have the most 

1113
01:00:27,311 --> 01:00:28,144
fucking twisted like fetishes because 
like nothing gets you off at that level 

1114
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:35,890
of wealth and power.
What does Simon callow get off on?

1115
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:38,860
[inaudible]?
I'd like to know.

1116
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:40,583
He just beats people to death for sport.
He just grinds up bodies and then puts 

1117
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:51,130
them into a sausage tubing and fucks 
himself with it.

1118
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,020
That's vulgar.
Jesus.

1119
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,510
Yeah.
Maybe that's all right.

1120
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:59,230
Let's move on.
We dissect it.

1121
01:00:59,231 --> 01:01:00,610
I think that's accurate though.
Just for the record.

1122
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:03,010
Look at his face.
I wouldn't be surprised if he shoving,

1123
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,570
you know,
body parts of his ass.

1124
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,390
What else would get along?
I get him off.

1125
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,250
Does he react at all during this clip?

1126
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,350
What is his reaction to.
I think he looks disgusted.

1127
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,740
Oh,
I don't know that he saw necessarily.

1128
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:21,490
Right?
Like I don't.

1129
01:01:21,491 --> 01:01:22,324
I don't.
I don't think he necessarily knows 

1130
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:28,223
everyone's joking around because they 
didn't see how free that's going to be 

1131
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:31,100
really frustrated for

1132
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:31,933
her.
It takes a lot of courage to on live TV 

1133
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:34,820
and be like,
hold on.

1134
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,040
Oh yeah,
fuck yeah.

1135
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:37,993
And nobody saw what happened.
So it's hard to be supportive of her 

1136
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:42,463
right in that moment that the on the 
couch don't necessarily see how severe 

1137
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:46,480
it is.
Just God bless her,

1138
01:01:46,481 --> 01:01:48,320
you know,
and God bless her.

1139
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,710
That's all I can say.
All right,

1140
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:51,380
fuck no,
that's moving on.

1141
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:52,533
She does spice girl in my heart.
She's got a lot of spice and she has a 

1142
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:58,880
spice girl.
It's confirmed,

1143
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,150
confirmed spice girl there.
So,

1144
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:02,984
um,
we announced a giveaway last week for 

1145
01:02:07,011 --> 01:02:09,340
the way a lot of people submitted songs 
about Ian.

1146
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:12,290
The end turn.
We got a lot of great submissions,

1147
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:16,540
but there was one that really rised 
above a.

1148
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,780
Oh shit.
I have to play it.

1149
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,950
God dammit.
Can you play it?

1150
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:21,150
Yeah,
actually I got it ready.

1151
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,013
Hold on.
So there was one song that really rised 

1152
01:02:25,021 --> 01:02:25,854
above made by Jan occasion.
It's a beautiful little diddy that 

1153
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:35,830
expresses my inner feelings on the 
Internet.

1154
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,480
Sometimes he's,
he,

1155
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,640
you know,
he's there and he tries his best,

1156
01:02:39,641 --> 01:02:44,641
but goddammit.
And so God,

1157
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,660
goddammit,
Cajun Cajun,

1158
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:49,080
and I'm giving you what are you giving 
them?

1159
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:54,810
Beautiful s nine plus.
Oh boy,

1160
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:57,130
this is the best phone on the market 
folks.

1161
01:02:57,131 --> 01:03:02,131
And let me tell you what,
I got a special twist open.

1162
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,710
I got a special little incentive.
Goddammit,

1163
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:07,340
didn't you weren't supposed to 
procreate.

1164
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:09,660
God dammit.
Oh,

1165
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,440
it opens this way.
Oh,

1166
01:03:11,441 --> 01:03:12,274
there you go.
That's so in my bed and you were 

1167
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,880
supposed to coach me on how to open this
box.

1168
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,340
And this is the one that I'm.
This is the,

1169
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:19,710
this is.
Okay.

1170
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:20,973
This is yours.

1171
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:25,940
Comes with my DNA.
Cajun Cajun grants.

1172
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,510
You can you comes with my kiss marks and
my DNA.

1173
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,553
So that's going out to the Cajun Cajun.
And there's another person I want to 

1174
01:03:31,901 --> 01:03:32,734
give an award on,
a phone to my favorite phone on the 

1175
01:03:34,571 --> 01:03:35,740
market.
By the way,

1176
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:39,940
Samsung has graciously supported us.
They've given us what they send us.

1177
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,650
10 of these 10,
something like that.

1178
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:44,350
Look at you.
Notice this fucking beautiful new TV.

1179
01:03:44,351 --> 01:03:46,600
Samsung's hooking it up and supporting 
us,

1180
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,720
which is great because they're pacing my
favorite tech company.

1181
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,290
Um,
we're going to keep giving these away.

1182
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:56,780
What is this like a thousand dollar 
phone given that.

1183
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,450
So what's,
what's the retail value?

1184
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:02,860
Let's look it up a lot.
Samsung Galaxy,

1185
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:06,720
so I am going to give away another phone
to this.

1186
01:04:06,721 --> 01:04:07,554
This one guy,
he submitted a prank call that he made 

1187
01:04:10,571 --> 01:04:11,404
with my voice.
He called a health food store and he 

1188
01:04:13,751 --> 01:04:14,584
made a soundboard of my voice when I was
talking about Keto Diet and the call is 

1189
01:04:19,301 --> 01:04:19,780
pretty good.

1190
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:20,613
It's not like genius,
but I love that he created this really 

1191
01:04:25,151 --> 01:04:29,360
specific soundboard of me talking about 
Keto and my hope is that by.

1192
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:31,210
I want to watch with you guys.
It's a lot of fun.

1193
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,490
I want more shit from you guys.
I want soundboards.

1194
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,690
I prank calls.
I want parody songs.

1195
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:38,703
I want everything cool.
Send it goddammit to 

1196
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:44,770
podcast@hthreehthreeproductions.com.
We're going to show it.

1197
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:47,170
We're going to credit you and our 
favorite ones,

1198
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:51,850
our favorite ones are getting hooked up 
with my DNA.

1199
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:57,250
That's also on an SDM plus.
You can choose to not have DNA,

1200
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,040
but I think most of you are going to 
want some of my baby for skin.

1201
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,060
I am one of the super regenerative 
babies.

1202
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,270
Magic being a baby with Super Regena to 
for skin DELAC escapes the factory,

1203
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:14,170
but you're forced can keeps fucking 
growing like it never stopped.

1204
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:15,004
So wow.

1205
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:18,820
You have to cut it like toenails.
You have to keep it on a monthly basis.

1206
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:22,270
It's a monthly breast.
Yeah.

1207
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:27,490
Did you know,
and this just occurred to me and I think

1208
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:30,400
it's worth sharing and this is real,
that in Israel,

1209
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:35,930
the very religious Jews have when they 
have brisses and please,

1210
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:37,953
I'm not kidding,
the rabbis know where this is going to 

1211
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:42,243
suck the baby's fucking Dick.
They cut the force going off and then 

1212
01:05:47,171 --> 01:05:52,171
the rabbis suck the blood out of his 
newly freshed fucking dig hygienic and a

1213
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:55,234
lot of the times these nasty old fucks 
have like herpes and they'll give the 

1214
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:04,000
fucking room what?
These guys are so insane.

1215
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:07,150
These ultra religious guys,
like they tried to outline that,

1216
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,940
that practice in Israel recently,
but it didn't pass because they're like,

1217
01:06:09,941 --> 01:06:11,680
listen,
if I want to suck a baby's Dick,

1218
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:13,743
who are you to tell me now?
I wonder if he's trying to suck the 

1219
01:06:16,001 --> 01:06:18,580
regenerative for you know,
stem cells.

1220
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,410
Maybe.
Maybe.

1221
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,890
Imagine,
imagine for a second damn,

1222
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,510
putting a baby's bleeding dick in your 
mouth.

1223
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:27,230
I'm not going to imagine that.

1224
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:36,690
Just imagine being that guy.
What the fuck man out here it goes.

1225
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:40,960
Here it goes.
Nothing.

1226
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,460
Imagine being.
That guy is insane.

1227
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,380
These religious guys,
I'm telling you,

1228
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,210
man,
they're from another planet entirely.

1229
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,220
These,
these same cookie fucks.

1230
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:55,443
There's some,
a Jewish holiday where they grab a 

1231
01:06:57,101 --> 01:07:01,660
chicken and fucking spin it around over 
their fucking heads until it like shit's

1232
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:04,330
everywhere and it's just sprang shit 
everywhere.

1233
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:07,670
And then when they're done,
they go suck a baby's bleeding thick.

1234
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:15,460
These are the French,
by the way.

1235
01:07:15,461 --> 01:07:18,790
This is not right.
This is like they're out there.

1236
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:19,923
Yeah.
It's basically like the Judaism version 

1237
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:22,804
of like the um,
what those limit ticks that like always 

1238
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,010
causing a scene at like,
uh,

1239
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:29,440
oh,
uh,

1240
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,330
the funerals in the Baptist church.
Just like,

1241
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:33,911
Bro.
Yeah.

1242
01:07:33,911 --> 01:07:35,140
Westborough.
I can see them.

1243
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:39,880
I like to see them square off the 
insane,

1244
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:41,080
insane battle.

1245
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:46,150
I think I got to be frank.
I think the Jews in this case,

1246
01:07:46,151 --> 01:07:46,984
when you think so well,
they got the vitality from the baby for 

1247
01:07:50,051 --> 01:07:50,884
skin,
so it's hard to top sucking a baby's 

1248
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:54,063
bleeding.
Dick can't really top that and I and I 

1249
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,570
feel bad even saying it.
Folks,

1250
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,610
can I call you folks anyway?
Let's play the song.

1251
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:06,880
So the prank song by are the prank call 
by.

1252
01:08:06,881 --> 01:08:08,530
Sound mastered.
Tony,

1253
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,440
go ahead and roll it down so I'm must 
have.

1254
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:11,380
Totally.
Here we go.

1255
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,410
Turn it up.
Excuse me.

1256
01:08:15,411 --> 01:08:17,330
Can you help me with something?
Sure.

1257
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:20,570
Can you be kind and take the time to 
help me out?

1258
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:24,140
What are you showing visually right now?
Your beautiful face.

1259
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,150
That's going to be awkward.
What you want?

1260
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,083
I guess I don't know,
but I can just sit here for two minutes 

1261
01:08:30,831 --> 01:08:32,160
and it's just showing them.
Feel like.

1262
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:34,790
Just go wide.
I like that.

1263
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:36,240
Yeah.
People love that shit.

1264
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,540
Internalized depression.
Face here.

1265
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,560
I'm going to play it on my computer.

1266
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:40,710
Well,
this is Gina.

1267
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:41,543
How can I help you?

1268
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,580
Excuse me.
Can you help me with something?

1269
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,593
Sure.
Can you be kind and take time out of 

1270
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:46,874
your day to help me?

1271
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:47,960
How can I help you?

1272
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,840
I'm going to be fully honest.
I don't understand the Keto Diet.

1273
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:52,790
Uh,
well,

1274
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,770
the Keto Diet is,
you know,

1275
01:08:54,771 --> 01:08:56,210
it's like,
have you heard of the,

1276
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,460
a axis diet?
Yes.

1277
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,700
Okay.
So it's going to be somewhat similar.

1278
01:09:01,701 --> 01:09:02,534
You have to be in the same pattern of 
what it is that they need you to do and 

1279
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:10,550
then they have their products that you 
can,

1280
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:12,680
that will help you lose weight.

1281
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:15,870
This whole thing of like don't eat fruit
just seems fishy to me.

1282
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,590
Oh,
maybe I'm around.

1283
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:18,980
Yeah.
No,

1284
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:21,423
you know,
it's Kinda like you just eat a lot of 

1285
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,440
bacon and,
and meet,

1286
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,910
you know,
nothing else.

1287
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:28,700
So,
okay.

1288
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:32,960
For breakfast,
eat eggs and cheese and bacon deep fried

1289
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:33,240
and covered

1290
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,073
canola oil.

1291
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:37,790
Dramatica.
She doesn't bat an eye.

1292
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,430
She's like,
Yep,

1293
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,860
that's the dying your hair

1294
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:45,940
that on that guy at a.
I would recommend talking with him.

1295
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,650
He'll be back in the store on.

1296
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:48,763
Do you feel like people hate fat people 
know at the grocery store their sugar 

1297
01:09:54,471 --> 01:09:55,820
and fucking everything?

1298
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,030
Well that,
that,

1299
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:58,840
that there is,

1300
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:03,840
it's so easy for skinny people like you.
I crave and desire hamburgers and pizza.

1301
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,600
Hm.
Well,

1302
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,210
is it an issue of self control?

1303
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,053
Yes,
it is.

1304
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:12,940
I've always known that about fat and 
skinny at the same time.

1305
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:14,590
Huh?

1306
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:16,660
I'm healthy at 400 pounds.

1307
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,080
Well,
but if you'd like to talk,

1308
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,290
you know,
talk more with John about that diet.

1309
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:23,090
You're more than welcome to call back on
Friday.

1310
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,270
I used to be fit.
Okay.

1311
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,940
Are you actively still on the decline?
Weight Wise?

1312
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,190
Uh,
are you asking me personally?

1313
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:32,360
Yes.
Wow.

1314
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:35,660
Yeah.
Is this going?

1315
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:39,590
I don't remember if it goes anywhere.
I mean there's,

1316
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:42,660
there's not a climax necessarily,
so you guys get the idea.

1317
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:46,070
It's not a genius prank call,
but I love that he,

1318
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:49,020
he sound boarded this Keto thing and 
call it,

1319
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,560
love it.
I want your guys stop.

1320
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:56,120
Help me be funnier.
I'm not funny.

1321
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:00,440
I don't have the time to make segments.
You make segments for us.

1322
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,750
That's what I love.
Genius.

1323
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:03,643
And frankly,
if you guys have a funny prank call or 

1324
01:11:06,531 --> 01:11:09,500
maybe if it's neither unrelated to me 
necessarily,

1325
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:12,970
we want to hear it and if it's funny 
we're going to use it and we're going to

1326
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,410
you a fricking phone.
Not a bad deal.

1327
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:19,670
So I looked it up.
It's about 950 bucks.

1328
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:20,960
Whoa.
Whoa.

1329
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:24,120
You can Ebay.
I won't judge you.

1330
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,730
You're not gonna want to though once you
open it up obviously.

1331
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,160
Alright,
we're alright.

1332
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:32,131
Come on.
Oh,

1333
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:35,520
here's a good one.
This is a good one.

1334
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:36,720
You guys.
Ty Lopez.

1335
01:11:36,721 --> 01:11:39,540
Friend of the show.
But I mean let's do this.

1336
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,430
Let's be honest.
Well I've,

1337
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,383
I've said many,
many harsh things about the lead 

1338
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:48,000
throughout the years,
but I just love this Tai Lopez.

1339
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:50,063
He's been doing these live streams and 
he's so cocky about it because he's 

1340
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:54,660
live.
He's like,

1341
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,430
yeah,
I can handle anything.

1342
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:58,590
Give me a call.
And so he's giving these,

1343
01:11:58,830 --> 01:11:59,663
these lessons on real estate and someone
calls in and basically calls them out 

1344
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:06,750
and shuts down.
Tie live on stream.

1345
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,573
Let's enjoy

1346
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,400
alive.
What's up youtube?

1347
01:12:12,401 --> 01:12:16,880
We're doing a live debate.
I'm curious.

1348
01:12:16,881 --> 01:12:18,830
I'm actually curious about your real 
estate jobs.

1349
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:21,920
All right,
so give me the formula for a cap rate.

1350
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,790
Can you define what a cap rate is?
So real.

1351
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,100
Let's talk about real estate for a 
second.

1352
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:25,970
Let's.
No,

1353
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:26,171
no,
no,

1354
01:12:26,171 --> 01:12:26,391
no,
no,

1355
01:12:26,391 --> 01:12:29,300
no.
The find the formula of the cap rate.

1356
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:31,130
Do you know what a cap rate is?
Absolutely.

1357
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:32,043
He's like immediately trying to deflect 
and for once this guy really hold them 

1358
01:12:36,011 --> 01:12:37,180
to it.
I don't know what the fuck it is,

1359
01:12:37,181 --> 01:12:38,014
but I assume it's probably some 
elementary thing that if you know 

1360
01:12:39,881 --> 01:12:42,250
anything about real estate,
you should know what this is.

1361
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:48,270
That's what I assume you crediting the 
channel.

1362
01:12:49,481 --> 01:12:52,000
Dan.
This was made by Evan.

1363
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:53,320
Judge put together by

1364
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:58,050
Capri.
It's like Roi and the stock market.

1365
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:02,810
They call it cap rate.
It's very similar formula or a Capri.

1366
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,780
All right,
John,

1367
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:04,613
can I say one thing about real estate?
You cannot teach a real estate course 

1368
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:08,260
and I love you bro.

1369
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,750
Look at his face.
You can see that humiliation.

1370
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:12,670
His eyes are squinted.
He's just like,

1371
01:13:12,671 --> 01:13:16,380
Damn.
All the slickness in the world die.

1372
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:17,703
You've got your.
You understand Thai that your laptop is 

1373
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:24,361
on two books about Mark Twain and 
economics on the bottom.

1374
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:27,663
You really think you want me to believe 
that you've read all three of those 

1375
01:13:29,951 --> 01:13:34,951
books,
tie volume one and two.

1376
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:39,690
The autobiography of Mark Twain tells me
one was Mark Twain born tie,

1377
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,660
and then he goes,
let me tell you about Mark Twain.

1378
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:46,750
Let's talk about huck Finn for a second.
Yeah,

1379
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,593
exactly.

1380
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:48,693
Jon,
Jon,

1381
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,833
but you cannot take a real estate course
if you can't tell me the formula of 

1382
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:55,300
account teacher who teaches my real 
estate course.

1383
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:57,430
John,
I don't know.

1384
01:13:57,610 --> 01:13:57,971
Oh,
sorry.

1385
01:13:57,971 --> 01:14:01,690
You don't know.
I don't teach my real estate course.

1386
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:02,583
I interviewed the top real estate 
investors that I know real estate after 

1387
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:12,223
you get started.

1388
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:21,360
Ty is honestly and as a,
as a guy,

1389
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:23,573
the honestly the master of bullshit.
What the fuck you want me to get that 

1390
01:14:27,981 --> 01:14:30,890
out of there real quick?
He is the master of bullshit.

1391
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:32,571
That was good,
man.

1392
01:14:32,571 --> 01:14:34,400
They held his feet to the fire and they 
got them good.

1393
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,710
Yup.
I want to get him on here.

1394
01:14:36,711 --> 01:14:41,711
I'm going to call tie and say.
Tell me about Mark Twain backed from the

1395
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:46,250
two volumes of Mark Twain's 
autobiography.

1396
01:14:46,251 --> 01:14:47,510
Tie.
Give me a freaking break.

1397
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,520
I love Mark Twain.
I wouldn't read that shit,

1398
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:53,540
but that's just me.
Alright.

1399
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:55,730
Let's get to the putting the pudding 
pie.

1400
01:14:55,731 --> 01:14:57,500
We've got a key lime pie.
It's fresh.

1401
01:14:57,501 --> 01:15:00,460
It's right.
I would say maybe an American Apple Pie.

1402
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,230
Warm out of the oven.
Good enough to put your Dick in.

1403
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:10,650
Apple Pie.
American pie.

1404
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:16,230
I'm KSI versus Logan Paul.
Now I will say this.

1405
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:17,603
I actually like Ksi.
I don't really have a problem with this 

1406
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,620
for you guys who don't know Logan.
Paul and everyone knows the Logan Paul's

1407
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:27,510
case size sides a really big.
He was Scott,

1408
01:15:27,511 --> 01:15:31,980
big plank FIFA,
but he's kind of like the English pewdie

1409
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:32,814
pie in a way.
He kind of just makes videos about 

1410
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:35,790
whatever.
He's very popular.

1411
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:37,613
And um,
he recently had a boxing match with 

1412
01:15:40,141 --> 01:15:40,974
another person who we won.
And now there's this whole big thing 

1413
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:46,740
about case I boxing logan.
Paul.

1414
01:15:46,741 --> 01:15:48,600
My favorite part about this.
It's such a circus.

1415
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,600
I'm telling you,
I can't be on youtube.

1416
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,680
It's,
this is what it's devolved into.

1417
01:15:55,681 --> 01:16:00,681
There's nothing genuine left with very 
few channels of a genuine left.

1418
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,770
Um,
it's very.

1419
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:11,870
Anyway,
Ksi little brother comedy,

1420
01:16:12,211 --> 01:16:13,290
shorts,
Gamer,

1421
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:18,030
and the undercard is boxing logan.
Paul's little brother Jake Paul.

1422
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:24,870
Also a friend of the show also show.
So I don't,

1423
01:16:24,941 --> 01:16:27,250
I don't have a problem.
I actually liked those guys,

1424
01:16:27,251 --> 01:16:29,560
but this whole thing,
it was just such a circus.

1425
01:16:29,561 --> 01:16:32,890
Like let me show you.
They haven't fought yet,

1426
01:16:32,891 --> 01:16:36,190
but here's the press conference from,
from the event.

1427
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,540
What are you going to do with.
I don't actually

1428
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:46,200
volume on the youtube a little bit.
Do you don't have one idea that is going

1429
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:51,500
to set up his camera.
I've got something familiar.

1430
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:04,501
Logan.
Paul,

1431
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:09,000
you're.
Who are you like one?

1432
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:13,980
You're Mr.
suicide prevention and now you're Mr.

1433
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:16,170
sit your ass bitch.
Sit your ass down.

1434
01:17:16,171 --> 01:17:19,230
Bitch.
The great white hope.

1435
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:23,770
Just a white boy from Ohio.
I don't know what that means.

1436
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:25,700
There was a movie called that.
I don't.

1437
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:28,180
I don't know if I just made some racial 
implications.

1438
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,420
So strike that from the record,

1439
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:33,653
but

1440
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,300
it's like,
who are you guys?

1441
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:38,010
Look at Logan and Jake Paul.
Like,

1442
01:17:38,011 --> 01:17:38,844
who the fuck are you?
There's nothing genuine about these 

1443
01:17:41,821 --> 01:17:43,920
people.
They're flying in the wind.

1444
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:45,023
They don't know who they are.
These are the people that youtube 

1445
01:17:48,151 --> 01:17:48,984
selects to promote and highlight and 
endorse and I don't know what it is by 

1446
01:17:52,531 --> 01:17:55,110
nature.
It's almost like survival of the fittest

1447
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:55,973
on Youtube.
It's like you have to be this 

1448
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:01,260
inauthentic,
a oil slick.

1449
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:06,480
The floats in the water to rise to the 
top is very rare.

1450
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:10,110
Very few exceptions have youtube 
channels that actually rise above,

1451
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:12,903
um,

1452
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:17,130
and,
and find success that are not this.

1453
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:22,700
What the fuck is he saying,
Hey,

1454
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,170
let me say this,
I'll just,

1455
01:18:28,171 --> 01:18:30,750
I'll keep this running because I really 
don't even care what they're saying.

1456
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:33,780
It's so obvious that they're pretending 
to play a role.

1457
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:34,723
Right?
I want to even be surprised from being 

1458
01:18:36,631 --> 01:18:37,464
honest.
If these guys talked regularly on the 

1459
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:43,860
phone,
100 percent just colluding,

1460
01:18:43,861 --> 01:18:44,694
you know,
to make this the biggest event ever 

1461
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:50,220
because their whole thing is like,
this is going to be make rager averse.

1462
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:53,430
Mayfield bigger.
That's how they're presenting it.

1463
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:54,683
This is crazier.
I bet you these guys talk on the phone 

1464
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:01,920
and they just jerk off about how much 
money they're gonna make and on one hand

1465
01:19:01,921 --> 01:19:06,921
I have to respect the brilliance of like
doing a boxing match.

1466
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:10,230
I think it is somewhat of a brilliant 
move,

1467
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,500
but it's like Logan,
you're not like,

1468
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:17,430
who the fuck are you dude?
Are you the lovable child entertainer?

1469
01:19:17,431 --> 01:19:18,900
Who cares about suicide prevention

1470
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:21,983
or

1471
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:26,590
are you a fucking.
I don't even know what he looks like.

1472
01:19:26,591 --> 01:19:27,424
He looks like

1473
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:33,010
he looks like a door to door salesman 
who's going bald at early age.

1474
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:37,800
You know,
and this is,

1475
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,870
this is the moment they live for where 
everybody's rushing on stage.

1476
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:42,680
You can't believe it.
Oh,

1477
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:43,523
the tensions are high.
These two guys are going to kill each 

1478
01:19:45,521 --> 01:19:46,810
other.
They really,

1479
01:19:46,811 --> 01:19:48,790
truly,
genuinely hate each other.

1480
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,050
They're all meanwhile like fast forward 
to this morning at 8:00

1481
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:55,330
AM.
They're both on this on like the toilet.

1482
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:58,240
Amen.
It's going to be great.

1483
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:01,900
Just got to really get the energy.
We got a rush each other.

1484
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:04,300
It's going to be cool.
Everyone's going to get freaked out.

1485
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:12,830
You want to play smash tonight.
They're like best friends.

1486
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:17,660
Um,
I don't know.

1487
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:21,710
This whole thing is so transparent.
Who would you,

1488
01:20:21,711 --> 01:20:25,760
uh,
could you box the hood I box like.

1489
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:26,663
Yeah,
because it's this whole thing with like 

1490
01:20:27,701 --> 01:20:30,800
youtube or xbox boxing each other.
Who's your matcha box?

1491
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,273
Um,

1492
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,510
I would box.
Um,

1493
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,333
what's this?
There's this toy channel with this 

1494
01:20:40,681 --> 01:20:45,681
little kid.
It's really a toy channel.

1495
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:51,940
Like little kid.
No,

1496
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
there's really popular one.
Hold on a toy channel.

1497
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,510
Youtube.
It's a kid.

1498
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:02,420
I imagine most of them aren't,
right?

1499
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,140
Maybe not actually.
I don't know.

1500
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,900
Uh,
it's like Jay's toys or some shit.

1501
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:13,860
Everybody knows what I'm talking about.
Anyway,

1502
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,390
there's this toy channel.
They get like 300 million views a month.

1503
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,333
It's just a little eight year old kid.
I would fucking beat the shit for all 

1504
01:21:24,361 --> 01:21:25,350
the toys,
baby.

1505
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:28,650
I can't beat up anybody and I fully 
acknowledge that.

1506
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,200
You know what I mean?
Sorry,

1507
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:33,900
I am.
I wonder,

1508
01:21:33,901 --> 01:21:35,970
I wonder how I would do in a fight like 
today,

1509
01:21:35,971 --> 01:21:37,170
like as a,
as an adult.

1510
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,640
I don't know.
I get my ass beat.

1511
01:21:38,641 --> 01:21:40,440
Probably ever know.
Fight grown up.

1512
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,270
Yeah.
But it's like you're a kid,

1513
01:21:42,271 --> 01:21:43,950
you're like major,
you know,

1514
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:46,550
resilient.
I don't know.

1515
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:49,010
Yeah.
Beat the a kid.

1516
01:21:49,011 --> 01:21:51,370
I mean,
most definitely.

1517
01:21:51,371 --> 01:21:53,750
I set it up.
I think I could take Jimmy Lee.

1518
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,510
Ooh,
I pay for that.

1519
01:21:57,050 --> 01:22:01,690
What do you mean Roy?
Somebody just said Roy in our chat.

1520
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:04,720
Roy.
I said,

1521
01:22:04,721 --> 01:22:06,850
Roy,
who's Roy?

1522
01:22:06,851 --> 01:22:07,900
Uh,
you.

1523
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:09,850
Who is watching?
I think this is the toy channel.

1524
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:14,380
Roy Roy.
It's not Roy.

1525
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:16,653
She's helped [inaudible] was trying to 
set up this match between me and the 

1526
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,080
angel.
He was doing work for me.

1527
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:22,810
It was a chamfer standing up.
It's going to be so late.

1528
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:27,280
Oh,
Ryan Ryan's toy review.

1529
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,740
Ryan's toy review.
Brian,

1530
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:31,930
I am coming for you and I'm fucking 
pissed

1531
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,840
it's going down.
Um,

1532
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:40,360
what's an adult I could take?
Danny Devito.

1533
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,710
Jimmy Lee,
for sure.

1534
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:48,700
I feel like I could take peewee Herman,
but he's a little crazy.

1535
01:22:48,701 --> 01:22:50,350
He's old though.
He's Wiley.

1536
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:52,270
Wiley.
Wiley.

1537
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:57,340
I don't think there's not,
there's not many even feels bad.

1538
01:22:57,341 --> 01:23:01,540
But you actually gave me the clue.
I type Roy toys and it said Ryan.

1539
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:05,520
So either you're on top of it tonight.
Oh God.

1540
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:10,060
Who could I anyway,
let's focus enough about me.

1541
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,753
Um,

1542
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:17,340
right.
I'm going to come out.

1543
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:20,010
I'm going to do this whole bit making 
fun of the Japanese,

1544
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:21,850
the suicide forest,
and,

1545
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,610
and rushed me.
Notice when he,

1546
01:23:23,611 --> 01:23:24,660
then,
when they rushed each other,

1547
01:23:24,661 --> 01:23:28,050
by the way that he never actually throws
a punch.

1548
01:23:28,051 --> 01:23:33,051
They just like collide and then everyone
charges in to do like this iconic,

1549
01:23:34,111 --> 01:23:35,210
like,
no,

1550
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:38,470
they went there.
No,

1551
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:40,590
break it up.
Break it up.

1552
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,113
Hold on.
There's this one where they rushed the 

1553
01:23:42,661 --> 01:23:43,710
stage.
I have to find this.

1554
01:23:43,711 --> 01:23:46,500
Maybe we missed it already.
It's here.

1555
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:48,780
It's,
what the fuck is he doing?

1556
01:23:48,781 --> 01:23:50,250
I look at,
this was the Nazi salute.

1557
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:51,960
You see how uh,
you see.

1558
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:52,813
Okay.
So I charged them but doesn't actually 

1559
01:23:53,641 --> 01:23:55,740
throw up.
It's like,

1560
01:23:55,750 --> 01:24:00,750
what are you intending to do your bit?

1561
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:05,720
You're going to be bald in two years.
Logan.

1562
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,150
Imagine Logan Paul Bald and like a 
Lamborghini,

1563
01:24:11,151 --> 01:24:12,410
like,
bawled,

1564
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:17,680
like bawled,
like not even like bristles a baby.

1565
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:21,890
I prefer the horseshoe.
Look.

1566
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:23,510
Honestly,
the,

1567
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,473
the old monastery left.
Imagine Logan Paul Balding sitting on a 

1568
01:24:28,941 --> 01:24:32,150
wagon cooking meat.
Like a monk.

1569
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:37,870
That's where it should be.
You still have that image in a robe with

1570
01:24:39,321 --> 01:24:40,680
a with,
with like,

1571
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,530
you know,
controlling the horse.

1572
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,270
That's Logan.
Paul.

1573
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:47,090
It's a fucking monk.
Anyway,

1574
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:48,980
it's just self address.
I'm sorry.

1575
01:24:48,981 --> 01:24:51,710
I think it's so funny.
I don't think there's anything genuine.

1576
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:53,080
I don't think they.
You know,

1577
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:55,100
and then here's the thing.
They're not.

1578
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,520
They want to bring 20,000
people into an auditorium.

1579
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:00,110
It's like,
Bro,

1580
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:04,490
this is going to be guaranteed the least
entertaining boxing match ever.

1581
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,700
These are two youtubers,
not trained professional fighters.

1582
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:08,803
Nobody's going to get knocked out.
It's going to go the full distance of 

1583
01:25:11,811 --> 01:25:12,644
the five because none of them have the 
capacity or the physical ability to 

1584
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:16,694
knock each other out.

1585
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,010
They're going to get tired after two 
rounds.

1586
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:20,023
There's gonna.
It's just gonna be a bunch of tired ass 

1587
01:25:21,471 --> 01:25:22,304
dudes throwing punches at each other.
It's going to end in a judge decision 

1588
01:25:26,031 --> 01:25:26,864
and honestly you could go either way 
because who fucking cares at that point 

1589
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:33,970
because you paid hundreds of dollars to 
watch essentially to untrained fighters,

1590
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:36,123
a throat wet noodles at each other,
which is basically all they're going to 

1591
01:25:38,901 --> 01:25:40,720
be throwing after two rounds.
You think?

1592
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:43,790
I mean this is like you pointed out,
this is obviously stage.

1593
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:44,624
Do you think the fight is going to be 
genuine in any way or is it like 

1594
01:25:46,161 --> 01:25:46,994
wrestling and it's pretty good?
I think it'll be real because they both 

1595
01:25:49,731 --> 01:25:51,260
want to win.
Sure.

1596
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,960
But I don't think either of them can 
knock each other out.

1597
01:25:53,961 --> 01:25:54,794
I don't.
I really genuinely don't know they're 

1598
01:25:56,391 --> 01:25:57,224
doing this twice.
There's like another fight date in 

1599
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:01,123
January.

1600
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:03,680
Yeah,
one of the first in the UK,

1601
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:05,690
but then they're doing a us one.
We should go.

1602
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,720
No,
I hear you.

1603
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:11,360
But I also think a lot of people are 
going to do that.

1604
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:14,120
I mean maybe it could be.
You know,

1605
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:14,954
it would be fun.
I've been wanting to plan a man on the 

1606
01:26:16,281 --> 01:26:17,114
street segment.
Maybe I've been wanting to do something 

1607
01:26:18,921 --> 01:26:23,000
with Joey Salads for some reason where I
sent him like man on the street,

1608
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,830
so or maybe not even joe sells,
but maybe someone we actually respect to

1609
01:26:27,831 --> 01:26:30,290
go create a segment,
you know,

1610
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:31,950
and play it on the podcast.
I mean,

1611
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,310
Shit Dude,
I think that's a great idea.

1612
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:37,220
And Ian,
you down,

1613
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,490
you're down to go to the UK to go watch 
a kids eye versus logan?

1614
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:41,423
No,
he's in La.

1615
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:42,440
I thought.
No,

1616
01:26:42,441 --> 01:26:44,210
I think.
Well the first one is in the UK.

1617
01:26:44,410 --> 01:26:45,590
Okay.
Oh that makes sense.

1618
01:26:45,591 --> 01:26:48,020
I was wondering whether they're going to
do it in the UK because l okay.

1619
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:49,010
That,
that's interesting.

1620
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:50,023
August 25th in the UK.
Second fight is scheduled for February 

1621
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:56,160
20,
19 in an undecided venue in the US.

1622
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,250
Probably La Logan.
Paul is basically,

1623
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:00,680
he's fallen from grace.
I don't think he's selling maverick.

1624
01:27:00,681 --> 01:27:02,630
Merge his vlogs on getting that many 
views.

1625
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,430
Did it about a $7,000,000
house.

1626
01:27:04,431 --> 01:27:06,110
You know,
the property tax on $7,000,000

1627
01:27:06,111 --> 01:27:06,944
house.
I mean you're looking at well to one 

1628
01:27:10,551 --> 01:27:11,870
percent,
so it's.

1629
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:16,600
Is that $70,000
a year every year forever.

1630
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,340
I'm sure that youtube money we'll keep 
rolling in,

1631
01:27:20,341 --> 01:27:21,750
right?
Yeah,

1632
01:27:21,751 --> 01:27:22,584
probably but like to an extent,
but I mean when he bought that house he 

1633
01:27:25,321 --> 01:27:27,650
was at his peak.
Yeah.

1634
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:28,583
And now we'll look what he's doing now.
I'm sure he's going to get paid 

1635
01:27:31,651 --> 01:27:33,000
handsomely,
but the thing is,

1636
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:35,400
I haven't watched other people's 
reaction to this,

1637
01:27:35,401 --> 01:27:40,401
but hopefully they also don't get taken 
in with like there's a lot of details of

1638
01:27:42,001 --> 01:27:42,840
like,
look,

1639
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:47,841
when a look when Ksi told comedy shorts 
Gamer to chill,

1640
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:52,140
look at all these details.
Oh look what that means.

1641
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:55,890
It's all a bunch of fucking bullshit.
Look in the crowd by the way.

1642
01:27:55,891 --> 01:27:56,724
All these kids.
All right.

1643
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:58,380
I've talked enough about this.
Honestly,

1644
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:04,640
I'm boring myself,
but there was one funny detail.

1645
01:28:04,681 --> 01:28:05,221
It's like,
wow,

1646
01:28:05,221 --> 01:28:08,610
they're,
they're selling out this arena.

1647
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:13,650
It's the biggest sporting arena and 
Europe apparently I read and I was like,

1648
01:28:13,651 --> 01:28:14,484
wow,
I wonder.

1649
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:15,383
I wonder how they're the ticket sales 
are because the fight is coming up 

1650
01:28:17,251 --> 01:28:20,640
pretty soon.
So I'm go to the seating plan

1651
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,470
and I'm like,
Holy Shit.

1652
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:28,700
There's a lot of fucking seats.
Do I scroll down here?

1653
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:34,090
So these were never opened.
These are closed and these are,

1654
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:40,400
there's a lot of seats available.
You know like these,

1655
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,530
these are quite possibly we're never 
opened.

1656
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:47,750
I just looked it up with 21,000.
Is the capacity of that arena.

1657
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:49,520
It doesn't even look like they're at 
half of that.

1658
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:50,630
Yeah,
I don't think so.

1659
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:51,733
I mean it's not,
it isn't that far off next month I 

1660
01:28:54,891 --> 01:28:55,920
guess.
Yeah.

1661
01:28:55,921 --> 01:28:56,990
I mean you don't,
you don't.

1662
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:59,180
The ticket sales don't go up.
Right,

1663
01:28:59,181 --> 01:29:00,014
right.
What I'm going to be looking at when I 

1664
01:29:01,351 --> 01:29:04,440
watched that is I want to see the seats.
I want to see.

1665
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:07,540
Well what usually what they do is 
they'll like,

1666
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,393
they'll try to fill the,
pack it all in where the camera's 

1667
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:11,323
consumed for sure.
Like all these like ring side seem 

1668
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:16,020
filled.
But what is that like 2000 at most?

1669
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,590
Probably not even that.
Maybe a thousand.

1670
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:23,370
That's crazy.
Ringside seats man.

1671
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:27,940
It was funny but apparently yeah.
Apparently it's like $600 for a ringside

1672
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:30,240
seat.
Not Worth it.

1673
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:32,490
Sorry.
And that's not my budget.

1674
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:36,630
Let me see,
ticket prices and who fucking cares.

1675
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:37,501
I mean,
seriously,

1676
01:29:37,501 --> 01:29:41,250
who gives a shit?
So I don't know.

1677
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:46,530
That's what I have to say about that.
There you go.

1678
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:49,920
There it is.
Just like forrest gump and that's what I

1679
01:29:49,921 --> 01:29:53,370
have to say about that.
But nobody's clapping for me.

1680
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,710
I got you.
Thank you.

1681
01:29:57,980 --> 01:29:58,813
Thank you.

1682
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:05,140
At least one person on youtube is 
genuine.

1683
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:13,390
Thank you.
I deserve that.

1684
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:19,220
Um,
last week we spoke about Metamucil,

1685
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,330
which is what,
Chris,

1686
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:24,100
this is what everyone has been waiting 
for.

1687
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,240
Really?
Oh yeah.

1688
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,440
It's 30,000
people watching right now.

1689
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:29,800
Everybody's saying for this.
It was waiting for this.

1690
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:33,490
So it was recommended to me.
Um,

1691
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:36,460
and I bought it.

1692
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:39,803
It's kind of expensive by the way.
It was like 25 bucks for like 300 

1693
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:43,740
capsules.
And when you get the bottle it says take

1694
01:30:43,741 --> 01:30:45,540
five a day.
It's like these huge pills.

1695
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:46,910
Oh,
Jesus.

1696
01:30:46,911 --> 01:30:47,850
Okay.
Five a day.

1697
01:30:47,851 --> 01:30:48,750
Yeah.
It was like damn.

1698
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:51,250
But then I was like,
I'm not taking five.

1699
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:56,270
They'll not like a horse.
It's like a huge pill of like wheat,

1700
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:57,571
like,
yeah,

1701
01:30:57,571 --> 01:30:58,404
of course it's going to clean my bowels.
Why don't I just eat a banana at that 

1702
01:31:00,451 --> 01:31:03,610
point?
Well,

1703
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,660
I'd rather you'd have banana.
Anyway.

1704
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:07,494
I take two pills and this is a night 
where I'm going out to a party and for 

1705
01:31:11,701 --> 01:31:16,701
dinner I have pizza and I have alcohol 
now for any mortal man,

1706
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:18,283
any one of us,
this would result an absolute 

1707
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:22,670
catastrophe.
Total.

1708
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,140
A wasteland.
Okay.

1709
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,750
Of the anus and asshole area.
Frankly.

1710
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,610
Sometimes I should.
So disgusting.

1711
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:31,970
When I have diarrhea,
it sprays on my thighs and I'm not going

1712
01:31:31,971 --> 01:31:36,600
to lie.
Sometimes it happens sometimes.

1713
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:41,770
I mean sometimes you blast and it really
hits the side of the road.

1714
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,370
The deflection,
ice.

1715
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:45,780
I just thought you were like a shotgun 
blast and it was just,

1716
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:48,920
you know,
it's a buck shot at sometimes you.

1717
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,990
Sometimes I'll be sad when I have a meal
like this.

1718
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:55,500
You're wiping as I do this way.
Don't fucking hate on me.

1719
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,080
There were met by the way.
Ian fessed up.

1720
01:31:58,081 --> 01:32:00,820
He's a front.
He's a at the front.

1721
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:02,113
When,
when you guys were arguing about it on 

1722
01:32:03,221 --> 01:32:04,054
air.
Ian and I were arguing about it back 

1723
01:32:05,321 --> 01:32:05,900
here.
You know,

1724
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:09,910
I got to say too,
I was curious that night I went home and

1725
01:32:09,911 --> 01:32:13,180
I tried it your way and I gotta say it's
inferior.

1726
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:16,060
It's not a fear.
You are not used to it.

1727
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:19,120
If I tried it your way wouldn't respond.
I have years,

1728
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:21,580
decades of experience wiping it's muscle
memory.

1729
01:32:21,581 --> 01:32:22,610
Dan.
Yet will you.

1730
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:25,390
What do you expect to go home and just 
live?

1731
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:30,690
Live one evening in my asshole.
And you think that's,

1732
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:32,460
that's Dan.
You,

1733
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:33,573
you don't know what you're talking about
is I should give it another shot and 

1734
01:32:36,401 --> 01:32:37,360
fret.
And frankly I'm,

1735
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:39,220
I'm in the middle of something,
right?

1736
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,380
I'm talking about my shotgun.
Diarrhea.

1737
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,620
So the verdict is still out.
So

1738
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:50,800
you ever have a shit so nasty like you 
wipe and then you're like,

1739
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:54,250
I better check my thighs and cheeks just
to be safe.

1740
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:57,690
Sometimes.
That's reality for me.

1741
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,950
And this was one of those meals.
So I take these pills.

1742
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:02,784
I took two of them,
not five before I go out because when 

1743
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,970
I'm have fucking human garbage disposal,
what am I taking five?

1744
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:11,683
It's a little ridiculous and I have to 
say it the next morning I had the shit 

1745
01:33:17,431 --> 01:33:22,431
just slid out of my asshole with 
elegance and grace and a supple,

1746
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:29,180
a supple glide almost as if to say,
hey,

1747
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:31,770
you know,
it's going to be okay.

1748
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:33,920
Wow.
And uh,

1749
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:37,020
and I went to wipe and I wasn't a 
oneweb.

1750
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,220
There was,
it was some,

1751
01:33:38,221 --> 01:33:40,180
but not a lot.
I would say it was a three way.

1752
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:44,160
I don't necessarily have the courage not
to end with a wetland.

1753
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,540
I ended wet cause I mean,
that's just part of who I am,

1754
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,070
but I was,
I was shocked.

1755
01:33:52,071 --> 01:33:55,790
I was absolutely shocked by that first 
day result I was blown away.

1756
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:56,803
But since then I've been taking it every
day with my meal and I have to say I'm 

1757
01:33:59,631 --> 01:34:02,120
not,
I'm still not totally sold because

1758
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:05,580
it's,
it's,

1759
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:08,670
it's a weird thing,
like it's like greases your shit.

1760
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,460
It like slides out of your asshole,
like somebody sprayed,

1761
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:17,510
you know,
spent like a pam on your anus is like,

1762
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:18,840
it's just,
it's,

1763
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:20,370
it's not,
it's like a,

1764
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,233
it's like your anus.
It's like your intestines is made of 

1765
01:34:23,581 --> 01:34:28,581
Teflon and it's kind of a strange 
phenomenon in front being honest.

1766
01:34:28,801 --> 01:34:30,660
It just slides right out.
Wow.

1767
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:34,100
I wasn't curious before,
but now that you've explained the CRESCO

1768
01:34:34,110 --> 01:34:34,741
ass.
No,

1769
01:34:34,741 --> 01:34:36,930
I swear to God if you.
If you try these,

1770
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:39,053
you will experience a difference in and 
bowel movements so it on the bottle it 

1771
01:34:43,831 --> 01:34:44,664
says it can take up to seven days for 
your body to adjust to actually getting 

1772
01:34:47,011 --> 01:34:52,011
fiber for the first time in its life.
So I mean I'm enjoying,

1773
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:53,893
I'm enjoying it so far and I'm going to.
I'm going to keep reporting back but 

1774
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,580
it's real interesting.

1775
01:34:59,330 --> 01:35:00,163
But it's a mixed bag.
You're saying like if it's not off a 

1776
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:04,560
little bit after that initial.
No,

1777
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,980
no,
it's been pretty good.

1778
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:07,814
It's good.
It hasn't gotten better because I was 

1779
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:12,254
like wow,
I had pizza and alcohol and my shit was 

1780
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:14,623
this clean,
but I've had good days and my shit 

1781
01:35:16,521 --> 01:35:18,590
wasn't better than that.
You know what I mean?

1782
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:20,720
Which was what I was expecting.
So I'll,

1783
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:21,623
I'll,
I'll keep.

1784
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,030
I'm going to keep taking it.
Like,

1785
01:35:23,031 --> 01:35:25,580
I mean I enjoy it.
I enjoy having my,

1786
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:27,890
my asshole basically,
you know,

1787
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:30,080
like a,
like a slip and slide essentially,

1788
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,480
you know,
the slip inside.

1789
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:34,653
But do you know the ones where you hit 
the end and then you splash up and 

1790
01:35:37,461 --> 01:35:40,550
splash out lamp?
It's got like an alligator's head.

1791
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:43,043
It's like that.

1792
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:51,810
So I like it.
Alright,

1793
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:52,783
I'm going to have to give it a shot.
I'm going to sell so much of these 

1794
01:35:54,621 --> 01:35:57,140
fucking metamucil is man.
Where's my sponsor?

1795
01:35:57,190 --> 01:36:02,190
This up bear or whoever it is.
Um,

1796
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:07,040
because I'm away.
I wrote a song for Ila.

1797
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,083
Me and my friends wrote a song for you 
since she's gone and I'm the wizard of 

1798
01:36:12,561 --> 01:36:17,561
loneliness as I've previously coined.
Um,

1799
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,270
we'll get to that at the end.
But let's see,

1800
01:36:20,271 --> 01:36:21,950
I've got the WOMP womp clip.
Let me,

1801
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,930
let me play this real fast because I 
love it so much.

1802
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:24,711
I mean,
look,

1803
01:36:24,711 --> 01:36:27,950
I read today I don't,
I don't like to talk about politics that

1804
01:36:27,951 --> 01:36:30,020
much these days,
but oh my God,

1805
01:36:30,021 --> 01:36:33,050
this is,
this is special folks.

1806
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:36,320
This is this a special.
Let me look.

1807
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:37,183
I read today about a 10 year old girl 
with Down's syndrome who was taken from 

1808
01:36:40,881 --> 01:36:45,881
her mother and put in a cage.
I wrote about a try.

1809
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:51,350
I read of a of a girl with down syndrome
being put in a cage.

1810
01:36:51,351 --> 01:36:55,490
WOMP womp.
She's so fucking priceless.

1811
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:56,773
Crazy.
It's just so bright girl with Down's 

1812
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:02,270
syndrome who was taken from her mother 
and put in a cage.

1813
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:06,770
I wrote about a.
Did you say down syndrome?

1814
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:13,850
That's what he said.
Politics is such a shit show.

1815
01:37:13,851 --> 01:37:15,020
I love it.
It's such a circus.

1816
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:18,230
This is basically comparable to Ksi 
verse Logan Paul Right now,

1817
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:21,980
except with like little little kids.
Did you just say,

1818
01:37:21,981 --> 01:37:25,160
womp womp,
bet your fucking ass.

1819
01:37:25,161 --> 01:37:28,010
I won't bump to.
And that little girl with down syndrome.

1820
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,310
So unabashed about just taken from her 
mother.

1821
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,730
Didn't put in a cage.
I wrote about a.

1822
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:38,210
God bless him.
Dan had a funny note about this.

1823
01:37:38,211 --> 01:37:41,150
He said,
this is Corey Lewandowski.

1824
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:43,880
Ruined Down Lewandowski are,
or as you might say,

1825
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:48,470
Luhan against down skews.
Might not hurt.

1826
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:50,750
That's true.
That's too good.

1827
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,330
Well done.
Well done.

1828
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:56,330
Corey Lewin against down skis.

1829
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:00,803
It was trump's 2016 campaign manager 
until he was replaced by Paul Manafort 

1830
01:38:07,051 --> 01:38:10,010
who is currently in jail.
So this is a,

1831
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:14,130
this is a winning winners.
And this is a office you want to hold.

1832
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:18,710
Lewin Lewin against.
Downscale.

1833
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:23,370
Refused to apologize for the remark when
asked about it on Fox News.

1834
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:25,450
WOMP womp.
I just,

1835
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,030
it cracked me up.
I was just like,

1836
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:30,930
whoa.
He womp womp to fucking down syndrome,

1837
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:33,780
baby.
Crazy.

1838
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:34,953
Really?
This,

1839
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,590
I've got this.
I've got this Jimmy Lee clip.

1840
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:40,260
Um,
I guess I might throw it on.

1841
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,020
And then I want to play this song for 
all you guys.

1842
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:46,470
I got a song please.
I want you to watch it.

1843
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:47,603
So don't go away.
This is very important to me and to my 

1844
01:38:50,641 --> 01:38:54,840
friends who wrote it with me and to Isla
and to shredder who almost died today.

1845
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:58,760
Maybe I should just play it.
Well,

1846
01:38:58,770 --> 01:38:59,820
this is going to take us out,
right?

1847
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,190
Do we need to say goodbye now?
I'm gonna.

1848
01:39:01,210 --> 01:39:03,780
Watch Jimmy Lee.
Oh Shit.

1849
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,390
Hang on.
There's really not much to say about our

1850
01:39:06,391 --> 01:39:09,930
old friend Jimmy Lee is up to some 
antics that I find pretty funny.

1851
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:13,500
Um,
what are the numbers that,

1852
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:15,570
how are we doing?
Doing good.

1853
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,010
20,
29,

1854
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:19,170
29 point five.
Nice.

1855
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:21,440
Welcome everybody.
Thanks for tuning in.

1856
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:23,340
God bless you.
Appreciate you so very much.

1857
01:39:24,570 --> 01:39:27,550
A Jimmy Lee,
the Jersey outlaw.

1858
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:31,110
He's still at it.
He's dangerously funny.

1859
01:39:31,111 --> 01:39:33,390
Do you remember Jimmy Lee?
Probably.

1860
01:39:33,870 --> 01:39:38,100
He's like this incredibly racist,
abrasive unfunny.

1861
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:42,300
Just really a character and the worst 
way possible.

1862
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:43,703
We had him as a guest.
It was one of the worst episodes we had 

1863
01:39:46,531 --> 01:39:48,600
as mad as a guest and after our first 
break,

1864
01:39:48,601 --> 01:39:50,580
me Dan and Isla were huddled in the 
corner.

1865
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:54,060
He was outside and we're like,
did we can't,

1866
01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:55,770
this can't go on.
We have to end this.

1867
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:57,970
So we actually gave them the,
the,

1868
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:02,250
the cartoon came off the stage.
It's frankly,

1869
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,113
it's our fault.
I think that we should have anticipated 

1870
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,430
that this would have.
It was a formative experience for us.

1871
01:40:08,431 --> 01:40:09,900
We didn't really know what we were doing
at the time,

1872
01:40:09,901 --> 01:40:10,734
but it's fine.
It was,

1873
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:12,210
it was early days,
but anyway,

1874
01:40:12,211 --> 01:40:14,580
he started view body.
He doesn't actually,

1875
01:40:14,581 --> 01:40:18,990
I'm having an engaged audience,
but this video has one point,

1876
01:40:18,991 --> 01:40:22,220
2 million views,
94 comments and 900 likes.

1877
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:26,100
So he started view bonding,
which I find pretty,

1878
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:29,340
pretty terrific.
Once sick of the comments,

1879
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,290
Jimmy,
you're my father.

1880
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:33,810
I don't think a youtube video has ever 
made me laugh so hard.

1881
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,073
Oh,
cheers to you about literally couldn't 

1882
01:40:39,721 --> 01:40:42,330
finish this one,
made it halfway and stopped too cringey.

1883
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:43,291
Well,
anyway,

1884
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:46,590
let's,
let's give you a taste of this viral hit

1885
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:49,050
God,
Jesus Christ.

1886
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:49,983
And you mixed your fucking audio right?
So the video starts while you watch for 

1887
01:40:55,871 --> 01:40:56,704
yourself.
The video starts with five seconds for 

1888
01:41:05,471 --> 01:41:08,750
the video.
Begins with them having crowds of people

1889
01:41:08,751 --> 01:41:13,751
pretending to know who he is,
which is a phenomenon I've noticed,

1890
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:17,720
you know,
spring in his videos.

1891
01:41:18,050 --> 01:41:21,440
It's a part of his plan to view,
but I guess is that he's,

1892
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:24,080
he's building this great story about 
himself.

1893
01:41:24,650 --> 01:41:25,640
He's got security guards,

1894
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:27,260
perfect.
Say Dangerous,

1895
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:30,810
really funny or comedy reality show on 
television.

1896
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:33,480
It hits three,
2018,

1897
01:41:33,630 --> 01:41:33,980
by the way,

1898
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:34,813
every year he's like,
my new hit series is hitting spring 

1899
01:41:37,461 --> 01:41:41,960
2017,
spring 2016.

1900
01:41:41,961 --> 01:41:42,531
It's like,
man,

1901
01:41:42,531 --> 01:41:46,120
we are all waiting for that hit big 
breath.

1902
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:47,083
Can't wait.

1903
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,530
Yeah,
that's a lot of enthusiasm and he got it

1904
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:53,870
from them.

1905
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:00,840
What are you,
the president?

1906
01:42:00,841 --> 01:42:05,841
You've got like secret service with air 
pieces and shit and I can't watch this.

1907
01:42:05,941 --> 01:42:07,320
I really.
It's so painful.

1908
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:09,870
I just thought it was funny.
I thought it was like Damn Jimmy.

1909
01:42:09,871 --> 01:42:11,040
Still trying to.
In a way,

1910
01:42:11,310 --> 01:42:13,080
you've got to give it up till till Jimmy
like,

1911
01:42:13,081 --> 01:42:14,070
you know what?
Let's watch a clip.

1912
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:16,290
Let me.
Don't cut them off.

1913
01:42:16,291 --> 01:42:17,041
Let's do it.
Let's see.

1914
01:42:17,041 --> 01:42:22,041
Some of his comedy or weekly.
How often were you brought up?

1915
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:25,420
How are you,

1916
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:28,280
but don't recognize you.

1917
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:34,280
Nikki's cowboy fall.
You frustrated.

1918
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,440
You're wanting to talk to Jimmy.

1919
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,550
Oh,
just what happens when your parents beat

1920
01:42:41,551 --> 01:42:42,384
you up as a kid.

1921
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:48,320
He's like,
am I right to the guy?

1922
01:42:51,690 --> 01:42:53,350
So let me ask you something.
Urban Cowboy.

1923
01:42:53,351 --> 01:42:54,310
Brett,
zoom in.

1924
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:55,733
Zoom in.

1925
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:56,860
No,
no,

1926
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:57,693
no,
no.

1927
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:03,590
Let's get this first date or second date
where your quickie or a long time ago.

1928
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:05,830
Wow.
Tell me how you did it.

1929
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:12,940
I'm going to ask when you were younger,
was working in equipment work better?

1930
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:15,460
Like what are you doing on a daily or 
weekly?

1931
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:17,870
How often were you?
Um,

1932
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,720
were you a quick,
quick or are good?

1933
01:43:19,721 --> 01:43:20,960
Good.
Take your time and draw it

1934
01:43:21,170 --> 01:43:22,003
stuff folks.
Obviously funny and really we were 

1935
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:28,960
putting our audience in danger.
Showing them.

1936
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:30,320
We've seen,
we've seen enough.

1937
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:34,040
If you guys want to go through,
I want to say cringe.

1938
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:37,120
Afterlife.
Jim Lee shot.

1939
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:39,140
He's a friend of the show.
He's a great guy.

1940
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:40,903
I hope to hear from him soon.
I'd love to get him involved in some 

1941
01:43:43,191 --> 01:43:44,390
kind of segment,
you know,

1942
01:43:46,370 --> 01:43:49,160
because some dude at Jimmy is a true,
like a,

1943
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:53,420
like a goof spoofer.
I'm trying to think of like a walk back.

1944
01:43:53,490 --> 01:43:57,800
Did we ever settle on a whack back man?
For us there was the gas pack.

1945
01:43:58,470 --> 01:44:00,710
I was personally the gift bag.
I liked gathpath.

1946
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:01,820
Yeah,
he's a,

1947
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:06,350
he's an original gath packer.
Alright.

1948
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,070
Well,
I got to say,

1949
01:44:10,071 --> 01:44:14,960
I hope the show was okay.
I felt like I was bombing in here,

1950
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:16,333
especially the first half.
You're doing fine because you start 

1951
01:44:19,311 --> 01:44:20,940
sweating.
There's nobody in here too.

1952
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,310
I'm like,
oh my God.

1953
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:26,450
Stuff without either.
It's tough without Isla.

1954
01:44:26,570 --> 01:44:29,510
And that's why me and my friends,
we started playing music.

1955
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:32,720
What called the jokes last time either 
was gone.

1956
01:44:32,721 --> 01:44:37,721
We started working on this song called 
Goldmine and now the eel is gone.

1957
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:43,240
We finalize this.
It's a beautiful tribute to isla client.

1958
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,630
Um,
my better half.

1959
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:51,500
I miss her and I love her.
So with that being said,

1960
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:56,090
this is the world debut of the jokes and
guys,

1961
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:59,480
I will see you next Friday at the 
regular time with Bob Berman.

1962
01:44:59,481 --> 01:45:02,690
I'm so excited for that and I hope you 
enjoyed the show.

1963
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:05,210
Would that being said,
play us off

1964
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:27,873
where I can go out and do what you use 
in a bowl and I'm so and a to stones 

1965
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:04,800
throw because I just bought,
you know,

1966
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:22,210
it's just me listening to ed goes with a
sunset.

1967
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:31,540
It's all fools gold man.
Yeah man,

1968
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:40,240
I'm so,
so cold though.

1969
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:56,390
About a stone's throw,
but I just want,

1970
01:46:59,950 --> 01:47:04,950
you know,
I tapped the vein.

1971
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:15,430
The vault is full.
I had the midas touch,

1972
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:20,520
but it's all fools gold with that and 
I'm to.
