18
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:08,050
Neil is back in town,
so thankful to have you back.

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,150
I have been in the trenches taking 
grenades.

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,530
How many episodes did they do without 
you?

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,910
Thank for God or more.
I was gone a month.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,030
Well,
good to have you back.

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,020
You didn't get into trouble.
Well,

24
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:26,050
Leah was just telling me in the last 
episode as many of you,

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,120
but that's okay.
No,

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,980
I got to confront my,
you know,

27
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:34,981
my shortcomings that I overplayed the 
Roseanne sound soundbite.

28
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,890
I didn't see any of that.
What that was.

29
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,960
And now I have one too and I'm going to 
be using.

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,940
He'll hit me with the cricket.
I've got great news guys.

31
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,010

only video game ducky sitting across 

34
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:08,430

Soda play call in to eight.

35
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:09,830

Oh,

38
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:18,960

Alright,

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,640
are you guys doing great?
Yeah,

40
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:26,930
we're just enjoying our vacation here.
This is the highlight of the vacation.

41
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,990
I was thinking about hitting you with 
Roseanne,

42
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:34,991
but I get a headache right now.
I'm not going to ride that button.

43
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,763
So what brings you guys out to la?
Well basically they haven't left her 

44
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:45,850
house.
Last time we came out.

45
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,650
Is it a.
it's just to get at,

46
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,210
kind of just get out,
take a trip.

47
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,870
Nice.
See something besides Wisconsin,

48
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,350
like the three blocks around.

49
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,510
Like

50
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,000
what do you,
what goes on in Wisconsin?

51
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,950
Well,
we play tennis.

52
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,800
You do tear up tennis,
tennis.

53
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,440
No real play.
Real tennis or you know,

54
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,653
usually when we don't keep score.
It's just more about getting out there 

55
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:27,210
and exercise.
How frequently do you guys play tennis?

56
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,970
Really?
You know,

57
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,800
if we're doing really good,
we'll go every week.

58
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,370
But you know,
take some breaks.

59
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,150
Sure.
Reeks charge.

60
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,260
But the worse you are at tennis,
the more exercise you want them getting.

61
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,680
We're really,
yeah,

62
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,083
we get a lot done when we do that.
If you guys were like being out here in 

63
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:49,860
La,
I will say by the way,

64
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,753
that Uber that you guys took that we 
call it for you take two hours of which 

65
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:58,510
I'm very grateful and sorry for.
Yeah,

66
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,430
it was,
you know,

67
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:02,510
a relaxing journey.
Stopping and starting

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,993
Wisconsin.
Right?

69
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,720
You do.
But I dunno,

70
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,560
I dunno.
It's not have like people on motorcycles

71
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:17,460
over here going through like the blinds,
Wisconsin.

72
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:18,294
Like you have like an old grandma,
like driving on the wrong side of the 

73
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,043
road.

74
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,190
La driving nuts though,

75
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,493
the cycle between the car has always 
struck me as very oddly reckless 

76
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,160
behavior.
It is,

77
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:39,070
but I think when you're on the 
motorcycle you feel like you know better

78
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,090
than everyone can do this.

79
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,060
I'm on a fucking motorcycles.
Yeah,

80
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,680
till someone like until that grandma 
going the wrong way.

81
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,540
Then all of a sudden

82
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,750
I didn't know.
They scare me man,

83
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,743
because like all the sudden they're 
recklessness becomes my problem because 

84
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,123
I'm in traffic.
I'm not paying that close attention to 

85
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:00,670
like what's in between me and the next 
car.

86
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,280
All of a sudden I'm switching lanes.

87
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,740
No,
we have a word for them in Wisconsin.

88
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,740
She calls them ancient alien.
What?

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,860
The motorcycle.
Old People,

90
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,630
old people.
It's anyone who's like,

91
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,733
you know,
and they're driving the wrong way down 

92
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:28,050
the road or they like just stopped in 
the middle of ancient aliens.

93
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,553
Old people that just can't see.
And college kids that are just dumb as 

94
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:37,680
hell and mishmash both.

95
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,770
Imagine that you know that guy from h 
and alien,

96
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,693
the crazy aliens.
That's who's driving all those cars and 

97
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,233
I'm talking about,
well clearly they're like not in this 

98
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,550
world right now.
They're like,

99
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,900
this is like,
what do you do?

100
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,120
Have you guys ever been in a car crash?
A,

101
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,430
I have not been in one,

102
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,700
but I wasn't very.
She machine ancient alien thing.

103
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,440
She's been in a lot of accidents stuff.
Maybe she is,

104
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,610
but after seriously never her fault,
but she's always done that.

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,360
What was it like?
What happened?

106
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,653
Uh,
one with some lady just went through a 

107
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:25,100
red light and just crushed into one.
That was probably the worst one was.

108
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,930
Yeah,
it was pretty scary.

109
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,550
Are you injured?
No,

110
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,870
we're fine.
What?

111
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:31,280
Did the car hit?
Your side?

112
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,900
Yeah.
Damn.

113
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,400
Our car didn't get killed though.
They're their card.

114
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,320
Did got maybe what car.
What car were you in?

115
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,490
What car were they in?
Do you remember?

116
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,580
I don't remember.
How old are you?

117
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,663
17 or 16 year survivor.
That's pretty scary to get at a red 

118
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,480
light.
That's not a.

119
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,270
that's like a serious.
It was,

120
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,410
you know the back.
Okay.

121
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,150
You spun out maybe.
Probably Shit.

122
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,153
I can't remember anymore.
You blocking it out of your memory suit 

123
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,010
from Adam.
What about you?

124
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,130
You've been in a car accident.
I'm just once.

125
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:10,964
I kinda like I was someone who was 
parked like in the middle of the street 

126
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,383
so I was going to go wrong with them and
then all of a sudden they started to do 

127
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:20,090
it.
You parked in the middle of the street,

128
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,460
like it was waiting for something 
waiting for you so it could hit you,

129
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,030
but it wasn't nothing serious.
It's all good,

130
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,050
but that's it.
My Dad ran.

131
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,970
Someone wants,
my dad is an ancient alien and the eight

132
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,643
he is a liability.
Have we told the story about how in 

133
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:43,830
Mexico,
like my dad is a psycho thought ever get

134
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:44,664
in a car with them?

135
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,013
Uber driver,
you have like one star driving around 

136
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:57,010
all day and nobody would ever get like,
I don't know what happened.

137
00:07:57,011 --> 00:08:00,490
We were getting off the off ramp and I 
was I think in the back seat and he just

138
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:03,910
rear ended a car.
Just rammed it.

139
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:08,200
Somebody like you do.
But there was a one time in Mexico,

140
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,993
he's got like an suv and they used to 
live in Mexico and he just driving on 

141
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:14,434
the freeway and Mexico like way over the
speed limit so fast that we're taking a 

142
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:23,270
sharp turn and you can feel the tires of
lifting God.

143
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,570
You could feel it being like my mom's in
the car,

144
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,420
I'm in the car dealers in the car.
That's the first time you guys met,

145
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,560
right?
Sort of.

146
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,220
So imagine.
Wow.

147
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,880
Well the story gets better.
Imagine that.

148
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,613
Imagine that.
This is how you're behaving around your 

149
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:43,734
son.
First Time you're meeting is serious 

150
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,853
partner.
Right?

151
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,980
And we're all yelling.
My mom's going crazy.

152
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:54,440
We're all yelling.
Gary and Isla,

153
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,890

yelling at him.

154
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,430
That's how fucking and meanwhile my dad 
is so crazy.

155
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,513
That's there silently doesn't even 
acknowledge it continues to rip the 

156
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,483
turns.

157
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,730
It's weird.
You like shuts down.

158
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,880
I knew it was fucked up.
I should probably.

159
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,140
Everyone was.
It was scary.

160
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,970
And my dad,
he's,

161
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,790
he's on the road.
He went to Ucla.

162
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,850
I don't know if you guys know about like
college rivalries.

163
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,440
He went to Ucla,
which is University of California.

164
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:46,550
Their rivals in La is USC.
They're like huge sports rivals,

165
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,850
so his license plate said hates sc and 
it's still,

166
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:54,190
I think,
made to have that license.

167
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,520
So when he sees someone on the road,
what they use,

168
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:58,354
license plate holder license,
we'll cut them off and I swear to you 

169
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,530
with children in the car and the whole 
family,

170
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,420
he will cut off another person on the 
road with his eighth sea,

171
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,430
like as if they were as if they were 
Nazi war sickness.

172
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,920
That's scary.
But I'm sweet guy though.

173
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,700
But anyway.
What are your parents like?

174
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,440
Your parents have any crazy uh,
corks.

175
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,420
Mom is fun.
Oh,

176
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:35,490
that's a good teacher.
It's crazy.

177
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,730
She's,
you know,

178
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,623
she's uh,
she has guess she has a excuse because 

179
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:43,680
she's a teacher.
That is,

180
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,710
if you're a teacher for like for like 
five years,

181
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:50,550
you're like your mental patient and if 
we just keep going,

182
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,780
it's just worse than worse.
What grade does she teach?

183
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,933
Uh,
I think she was teaching second or 

184
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,380
third.
Oh Wow.

185
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,363
Let's stop now.
She used to teach middle school or high 

186
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:04,530
school and middle school.
Middle School was way worse.

187
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,880
Scary to me.
In middle school.

188
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,360
High school was really bad.
Middle School's really bad.

189
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,490
Yeah,
and then the greatest second.

190
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,810
That's crazy.
Which one's the craziest?

191
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,540
Middle School or second grade?
I think high school and middle school.

192
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,030
That's like getting into fights.
Yeah.

193
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,930
I feel like middle school's got to be 
the worst.

194
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,190
Right?
Dangerous minds.

195
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,610
What's the actress's name and dangerous 
minds know that moment,

196
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,610
right?
She was like this,

197
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,444
like pretty young blonde teacher who's 
teaching in like the hood that was is 

198
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,840
called the poetry one.
There could have been poetry.

199
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,260
Michelle pfeiffer.
Oh,

200
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:52,760
I did not know that.
It's called.

201
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,410
Oh yeah,
baby.

202
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,870
I love that movie.
Throw that up.

203
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,890
Let me show you what your mom is up to.
Right.

204
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,410
Dangerous minds.
Got It.

205
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:06,640
I remember watching this as a kid and 
being like,

206
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,780
damn,
she's so cool.

207
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,480
She's so cool.
She connects with a trench coat.

208
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,620
I can't really wear trench coats to the 
school anymore,

209
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,280
so it's just like real knife in 
Wisconsin,

210
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:25,540
right?
The chalkboard.

211
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,770
We want to die.
Oh Shit.

212
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,710
It's crossed out,
we choose to die to get it straight.

213
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,900
Buster your mum do any lessons like 
that,

214
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,403
but I think.
I think middle school is the worst 

215
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,154
because they're like

216
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,473
in middle school you're such a piece of 
shit and high school you're starting to 

217
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,000
learn a little bit.
That's true that you're an idiot.

218
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,010
You're still an idiot.
No.

219
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,780
Yeah.
Full blown,

220
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:53,640
but it'll cool.
All right.

221
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,050
Jason's mom looks just like him that 
well.

222
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:57,884
He looks like it's.
Oh,

223
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,930
it's cute.
Yeah,

224
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,690
they have the same like mouth and nose.
Kinda pick summit sometime.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,440
So I've got.
I'm trying this new thing.

226
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:10,274
When we start our podcast,
we're doing this thing called goof for 

227
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:14,180
the day.
I've got some clips lined up.

228
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,920
I don't want to walk through with you 
guys.

229
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,660
Okay.
The first one is dj Khaled at performing

230
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,840
at an overwatch league is good.
It's great.

231
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,490
What I love about this is that he's like
dj cows,

232
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:32,540
not a performer,
right?

233
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,393
It's like the hype man.
So imagine like flavor flave without a 

234
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:39,080
band or anyone to back them up with 
actual musical palette.

235
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,570
It's just that stage.
It's crazy.

236
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,850
Here we go.
What does he have?

237
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,200
Oh God bless.

238
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,670
By the way,
you framed this up,

239
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,750
so like there's like 10 people actually 
waving their arms and their exit.

240
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,200
Well,
the rest of the room,

241
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:10,850
it's just like not interested at all.
Let's see.

242
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,110
Just a strange event.
Bam.

243
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,880
It's like Justin Bieber's not.
They're singing that DJ count,

244
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:19,410
which is the worst part of every music 
video.

245
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,880
Oh No.

246
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,580
Or five.
And it's like,

247
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,590
are you serious right now?
That's a good question.

248
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,900
And one more thing.

249
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,720
What it makes it look like,
what?

250
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,490
The phone light.

251
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,423
No,
but you people are holding their phones 

252
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:55,950
up.
They are.

253
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,170
They're making it look like they're 
holding their phones up.

254
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,870
No Way.
People have their phones out.

255
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,970
Wristbands probably.
Oh,

256
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,960
maybe like an event wristband.

257
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:16,710
Yeah.
Looks confused.

258
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,530
You can't do without the rest of the 
bank.

259
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,710
You know what I mean?
Like you take out another one is another

260
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:39,770
word you said plants.
By the way,

261
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,363
these guys were paid to dance.
Did you not even see happening at this 

262
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:17,450
point?
Gala?

263
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,960
No.
Get your own concert.

264
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:22,794
But like at a concert you,
you think that this could go on for two 

265
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:30,810
hours straight,
but you don't want to appreciate him for

266
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:35,811
even having the courage to do in this 
kind of like,

267
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:41,140
it really doesn't give a fuck.
But like a blizzard hired him.

268
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,283
Yeah.

269
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,690
It probably paid him like.
I mean,

270
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,710
I don't think he would go out there for 
less than $200,000.

271
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,203
Right.

272
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,380
We paid them pretty good

273
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,900
black.
Alright.

274
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,700
You sing it

275
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,333
Keller

276
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,273
good.

277
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,330
That was really good.
What do you think?

278
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,960
You found a decal?
I was out of all the performances,

279
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,813
a blizzard.
That was probably the number one the 

280
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,140
most.
But you,

281
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,003
I mean speaking of hip hop,
you are kind of a hip hop musical 

282
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:41,840
performer.
Now your new video came out.

283
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,730
Chicken or chicken wings,
right?

284
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,160
Yup.
I mean people are loving chicken wings.

285
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,393
I love it.
Let me play a sample for those higher 

286
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,990
pretty far.
Yeah.

287
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:54,480
I was loving that by the way.
I'm curious.

288
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,350
Let me just play it for reference.
Did you make this beat?

289
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,900
Yeah.
I made that

290
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,810
serious way.
Really for months on that road.

291
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,690
That beat is insane.
No.

292
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,300
What is it that's just.
You just never heard it.

293
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:21,190
I don't fucking know you.
I have Kinda kind of subtle.

294
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,230
Damn.
You can just rip is be like that and put

295
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:29,540
some chicken wings on it.
That's what it is.

296
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,540
Read the description of the video.
Pull it up.

297
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,870
Okay.
You'll see

298
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,330
it's legit.
Thank you.

299
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:38,770
Wrapping Gambini

300
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,860
for today that I can make this on.
Hashtag no lawsuit.

301
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Can you imagine getting sued for this?
Let me give you a sample of this same

302
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,510
insane.
Rapid.

303
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,380
This is a chicken dishes,
dishes,

304
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,860
the apple.
This is a seller.

305
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,560
I love the backup vocals.
You Officer Drake Salad.

306
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:14,980
This is electric.
This is your hip hop fan,

307
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,710
right?
Is your favorite genre of music?

308
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,440
What else do you like the star in the R 
and b?

309
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,580
Shit.
You are black.

310
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,230
This is my credit card next.
Overwatch

311
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,230
definitely.
I think he would totally correct you and

312
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,170
it.
I mean you elaborated by the way.

313
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,013
I love that

314
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,410
credit card.
Dope.

315
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,750
So good.
You like drake's new album and then.

316
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,160
Oh,
you don't fuck with drag.

317
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,140
I listened to probably like two albums 
in the whole year.

318
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,300
Really?
So you don't listen to that much music.

319
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,370
Last time he told me if I recall season 
to Israel and to really.

320
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,480
What are you really into right now?

321
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,313
Uh,

322
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,260
stevie wonder.
Hey,

323
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,120
crazy.
What else?

324
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,900
Uh,
just,

325
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,420
just stevie Michael Jackson.

326
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,950
He's gonna.
Try to go see some guy.

327
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,530
Oh yeah.
That one guy.

328
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,290
Kamasi Washington.
You hear him yell,

329
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,550
Saxophone Player.
Can you find a clip of that dinner in?

330
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,180
I want to hear it right now.
Cool.

331
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,630
Kamasi Washington.
I don't know if that's how you say it.

332
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,440
I've got another clip lined up.
I love Stevie,

333
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,303
but like have you.
How long have you been listening to 

334
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:50,380
Stevie?
Or did you just kind of get into it?

335
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,633
So you,
you've been riding the Stevie and 

336
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,750
Michael trend for a long time.
Do you share his musical tastes

337
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,191
well?
Yeah,

338
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,910
because he controls

339
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,620
horse musical taste.
If you had control of the cds,

340
00:21:03,621 --> 00:21:04,454
what would you play?

341
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,750
I have one CD.
Where's his six?

342
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,230
Yeah.
I don't know.

343
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,160
I tend to just listen to like whenever 
it comes on,

344
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:20,161
like the student radio or something like
kind of different like all the time.

345
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,230
So I mean if I had to say all time 
favorites.

346
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,640
Actually I really like Lana del Rey,
which is like I'm familiar.

347
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,820
I know I really liked her.
She one of the ones that,

348
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,880
was she one of the ones that died or 
something like people are like,

349
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,730
she's like a recent pop artist.
Yeah.

350
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,540
That's kind of the only like pop like 
thing.

351
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,020
Listen to you.
I listened to a lot of nineties music.

352
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:54,130
I guess it bird radio station.
I remember that.

353
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,010
Yes.
There's a radio station that plays bird.

354
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Nice.
What's it called?

355
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,030
Talking about like,
uh Oh,

356
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,850
cancer.
The leading killers of birds.

357
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Cats are the leading.
There's a lot of birdwatchers and what's

358
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,740
actually.
I've heard that,

359
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:21,574
that like that's funny.
Like cats are actually decimating the 

360
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,400
populations really.
I guess what do we do?

361
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,040
You know,
if bird radio gets affected,

362
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,780
here's this,
here's this music that the use interior.

363
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:41,530
Let's see what we got.
If you write anything really,

364
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,090
really,
and I'm ad block

365
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,490
got ad block on their Internet explorer,

366
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,760
you,
you,

367
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,390
you opened it with Internet explorer.
It looks like it's set to default.

368
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,890
Like Gimme a break.
I'm using discord and I click a link.

369
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,020
In what world would I want to open?
Anything in internet explorer?

370
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,770
You see it's a total disaster.
You know,

371
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,130
our sponsors pay us a lot of money to 
get their ads on our show and here.

372
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,780
Sneak right?
They didn't pay me shit.

373
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,560
Don't download that.
Download.

374
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,190
Not speak of it off the screen.
In fact,

375
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,590
I'm gonna.
Build them on the invoice.

376
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,250
Then you invoice them for me.
I'm going to say their name.

377
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,910
You're seeing this guy in concert.
This is your guy.

378
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,750
What's his name?
Kamasi Washington.

379
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,630
What's going on with him?
He looked very like Bohemian.

380
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,920
He's cool with that.
Actually.

381
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,090
I interviewed him a couple of years ago.
I shot an interview with him.

382
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,870
Yeah,
he was really cool.

383
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,690
Was the.
Was it an interesting interview?

384
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

385
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,450
It was just talking about his musical 
background and everything.

386
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,081
He's,
you know,

387
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:03,200
he comes from like the jazz world,
but you kind of crossed over with all of

388
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:05,090
the um,
brain feeder,

389
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,770
you know,
like Flying Lotus and those people.

390
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:08,560
No,
he's,

391
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,393
he's cool as fuck.
So you say he put his part of that role 

392
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,840
under cat and all those guys

393
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,150
sick.
Sounds good.

394
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,470
You're all about you like that soul,
that soul music.

395
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:21,630
Did you know?
Hey Janice.

396
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:28,000
I like it when they pick on it.
Stress.

397
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Do you hate this stress?
I'll take the same level for me.

398
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,833
I got another video lined up,
another good for the day because I 

399
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,114
couldn't decide between Dj Khaled and 
all of the Mexican workers going on 

400
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:50,470
strike and this guy filming it and 
losing his mind about it.

401
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,850
Okay.
Okay.

402
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,230
Good stuff.
Planned up guys.

403
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,050
Only the best.

404
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:59,050
Let me go get fucked up.
They sit on a come together yet.

405
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,570
So let,
don't know anything about who filmed

406
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,820
the story is that they're on some kind 
of smelting plant.

407
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,723
Two of the dudes,
I guess their boss supervises our 

408
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,893
comrades,
was all of a sudden rush of Soviet 

409
00:25:23,761 --> 00:25:24,594
Russia.
Their colleagues got fired or sent home 

410
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:30,360
for some reason,
so they all packed up and said,

411
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:31,650
fuck this,
you know,

412
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,120
salt,
solidarity.

413
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,433
So this guy who was working with,
I guess there's a bunch of Mexicans and 

414
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:37,784
a couple of black dudes.
So this is one of the black dudes who's 

415
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,160
an og of the Mexican camaraderie and 
spirit.

416
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,120
They up this book.
Fucking black people need to be your own

417
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:57,560
man.
I swear to God.

418
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:02,570
I think they sit up.
Isn't this motherfucking on my momma?

419
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,040
They are not bullshit.
They don't stop up in depth.

420
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,990
They thought they was going to play with
these amigos.

421
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,320
We rise together,
homey.

422
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,490
It may not take the same.
And look at this man.

423
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,050
They shut this big day on today.
We all went home,

424
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:35,500
man.
The Way God bless him.

425
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,310
I mean jokes aside for documenting that.
I'm with him,

426
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:40,121
dude.
That's cool.

427
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:41,890
It's probably going to get in trouble.
Oh yeah,

428
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,010
he's fired.
I'll never work again.

429
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,920
I love it that I'm with them.
I'm in solidarity,

430
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,670
but we need.
Why the hell do you think apple is worth

431
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:58,671
a trillion dollars?
No unions.

432
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,940
They don't have unions in China,
I don't think.

433
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:08,280
What do you guys think about apple being
worth a trillion fucking dollars?

434
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,130
Why are you an apple man?
No,

435
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,820
I am.
I found though.

436
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,780
I guess so you're sort of,
you're in your foot,

437
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,660
your foot's in the water.
You like apple?

438
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:26,060
We don't really have an opinion on it.
I guess it's very.

439
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,940
And we would have to look more into it.
I don't want to take any,

440
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:33,740
you know,
radical fucking hate bad.

441
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,263
I'm using it very sparingly.
Waiting for the right you can use that 

442
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,553
sucks.
And I don't understand like have all 

443
00:27:51,591 --> 00:27:52,424
come.
You can keep it of all companies in the 

444
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:54,444
world.
How is it that apple was the one that 

445
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:57,570
got a trillion?
I mean,

446
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,970
what are they doing?
So they just.

447
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,033
Yeah,
they're the most valued company of all 

448
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:05,304
time.
The first company ever to be worth a 

449
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,463
trillion dollars.
I mean they sell shit so they aren't 

450
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:14,070
getting or many fucking phones.
Are they selling?

451
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,233
I get it though because everyone's 
obsessed with that iphone all over the 

452
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:21,890
word and there were computers too,
so it's like,

453
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,420
yeah,
I get it.

454
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,270
It's expensive to like,
how the hell do people afford that shit?

455
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,830
But that means to me that like the 
margins are insane,

456
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,893
that they probably are exploiting hell 
of people for those margins to be so 

457
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:41,970
insane.
You know what I'm saying?

458
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,830
Like for someone to make a million 
dollars is hard enough,

459
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,263
you have to like step on a couple 
throats along the way to make forget 

460
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,820
about a billion,
a billion.

461
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,860
There's a couple of hookers in,
in your pool,

462
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,300
under your pool,
whatever.

463
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,340
At least several hundred immoral things 
happening.

464
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,210
Yeah.
Is Not being followed.

465
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,510
Apple is notorious,
but it's not just them inside in big,

466
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,050
big.
Like I was watching CNN,

467
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,610
they're doing this whole clip about 
like,

468
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,820
God,
I just outed myself for watching CNN.

469
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,683
So,
uh,

470
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,683
anyway,
they're doing this whole thing about 

471
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:26,454
like celebrating that apple made a 
trillion dollars and it's like 

472
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,530
celebrating.
Yeah,

473
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:32,364
they've done this whole thing about.
They were talking about it in a very 

474
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,053
glorious way.
It wasn't like they were doing party 

475
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:46,490
poppers and shit.
They had like a counter on the wall,

476
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:53,370
the live stream.
But like,

477
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,280
I don't know what's the exact figure.
But they have evaded so much money.

478
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,240
Tank taxes.
Yeah.

479
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,920
Like how many?
A trillion dollars.

480
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,720
How many Chinese?
Like,

481
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,460
I mean do it.
That's just Chinese.

482
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,700
Lots of Chinese people going down for 
those phones.

483
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,110
I don't know what to say,
man.

484
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,930
Lots of Chinese people are going down 
for those faults,

485
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,040
but it's okay because they're Chinese.

486
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:39,490
You got to get really quiet.
Really quiet.

487
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,280
You're going to hit me with the 
crickets.

488
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,120
I'm trying to carry on.
You were educating us.

489
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,110
We're newcomers

490
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:52,360
to the apple trillion dollar industry.
What?

491
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:57,650
Crickets.
I only needed one thing button there.

492
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,513
I'm curious.
You guys ever work like a normal ass 

493
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:05,220
job?
Yeah.

494
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,790
What'd you do before you were the 
sweetheart of Youtube?

495
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,120
Worked at a nursing home.
Seriously?

496
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,750
From my aunt.
What was your day to day?

497
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,113
Uh,
do stuff on the computer and like take 

498
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:22,460
old people to their employee

499
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,790
builder.
They're like,

500
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,630
push them around.
You ever do any dirty work?

501
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,233
Well you're not supposed to,
but like eventually you have to do 

502
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,853
because it's just like so much stuff to 
deal with and there's not enough people 

503
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:36,104
in.
Oh Wow.

504
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,750
So it was fairly stressful.
I can like,

505
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:41,300
I want to go on my chair and I was like,
don't touch old people.

506
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:43,660
You're going to break their back if 
you'd fucking touch a metal,

507
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,600
but the.
Then they start getting into by himself.

508
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,130
No,
you can't do that.

509
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,150
I'll support guy.
The craziest thing that happened to you,

510
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,480
how long did you work there?
Uh Huh.

511
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,230
Probably more than a little more than a 
year.

512
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,350
What was the craziest

513
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,760
thing that,
that you saw there?

514
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,650
One time I heard a lady,
she was like,

515
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,140
she would only.
She can only say like one thing,

516
00:32:09,141 --> 00:32:10,670
she was like,
Oh hey,

517
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,950
something.
I forget what she says.

518
00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:17,270
She says like the name Markish Hello 
Markus.

519
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,283
And I could like just here,
like one time I was walking and I could 

520
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:23,360
just hear like really?
I'm like,

521
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,333
what the fuck?
I opened the up the elevator and she's 

522
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,570
just sitting in there by herself.
Hello mark.

523
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,433
I'm like,
Oh shit.

524
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:30,883
She was like,
yeah,

525
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,610
elevator.
Oh my God.

526
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,820
Hello Markus.
Such such a hard job.

527
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,040
That's kind of sad machine.
They're

528
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:45,430
probably not that nine days to put her 
in elevators.

529
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,360
Just does whatever the fuck it wants.
You ever have somebody.

530
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,830
Did you ever take a diaper or anything?
That gnarly.

531
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,850
Okay.
Other people,

532
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,640
trained professionals.
Bart station,

533
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,560
nurse gun.
That's a tough thing to change it.

534
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:09,580
That a girl like a damn.
That's a thankless job.

535
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,783
Yeah.
Like that takes a lot of compassion to 

536
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,420
take up human shit out of a diaper.
Not a chat.

537
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,060
Not your own child.
A hard.

538
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,690
You didn't take any shit out of luck?

539
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,950
No,
I was,

540
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,500
I had probably the easiest job in that 
whole building and you know,

541
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:32,340
it was pretty stressful environment.
What about Yulia?

542
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,953
I had a few things like,
well since high school I had worked at 

543
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,730
like a convenience store.
Basically it was technically a op,

544
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,623
but like they just sell a lot of like 
food and snacks and stuff and I don't 

545
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:47,824
know,
I worked there on and off for like four 

546
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:54,951
years I guess,
but just I would like go like to college

547
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,240
and stuff for the semester and come back
and work.

548
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:59,910
So it wasn't like full time member but 
yeah.

549
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,803
And then uh,
the most recent job I had was at a 

550
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:10,131
bakery patisserie actually I was just 
like in the front,

551
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,640
sometimes I would help with like 
decorating stuff or whatever they needed

552
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:15,474
help but not really.
It was like a French one that I have a 

553
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:21,000
degree in French.
So it was like,

554
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:23,280
yeah.
Yeah.

555
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,520
So like I didn't have like a,
you know,

556
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:27,354
any kind of job to do with that.
So that was kinda like they were 

557
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:31,494
customers who would like speak French 
with me and like the pastry chef spoke 

558
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,510
French and stuff so I was just kinda 
like,

559
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,920
you know,
that's Kinda how I got into that.

560
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,460
Do you still work or are you guys.

561
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,343
No,
I'm well I've run in the online stores 

562
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,500
and depth and all that.
How,

563
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,473
how,
how recently were you doing that bakery 

564
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:55,130
job?
When was it?

565
00:34:55,131 --> 00:35:00,080
It was pretty recent that you had like a
date would have been?

566
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,120
It would have been the winter before 
last winter.

567
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,493
Yeah.
And the only reason I quit was because 

568
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:10,630
they shut it down.
They were like,

569
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,290
yeah,
it was so weird.

570
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:15,470
They didn't tell us anything leading up 
to like shutting it down.

571
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,663
They were just like,
we're going to have a staff meeting on 

572
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:21,650
Friday like everyone else to come,
and then he was like,

573
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:24,590
so actually it's shut down and

574
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,373
yeah.
Then you know to a break when we come 

575
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:37,080
back,
we've got no your man coming.

576
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,220
It's going to be insane.
Delco away.

577
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,800
That's right.
Good job on that.

578
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,873
See you guys soon.

579
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,380
Thank you to you.
To me for sponsoring this episode,

580
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,214
that h street podcast guys,
that Matrix is no longer a fantasy 

581
00:35:55,011 --> 00:35:56,000
because with you,
to me,

582
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,190
we are plugged right?
The FN.

583
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,353
Okay.
These guys are the largest learning 

584
00:36:01,101 --> 00:36:02,780
marketplace.
They've got courses,

585
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:08,260
really excellent courses on everything 
from comic book drawing to programming,

586
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,720
professional fields,
whatever you can dream of.

587
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,600
They've got courses for it.
You don't need to go to college and drop

588
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,430
$100,000
anymore.

589
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,460
You don't have to show up at 8:00
AM with a bunch of people.

590
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:22,400
You don't like to learn from somebody 
that doesn't want to teach.

591
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,190
You do it at your own time,
at your own pace,

592
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,203
the same level of learning even better 
because you can pause it and continue 

593
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,030
another time when you actually want to 
learn.

594
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:33,920
You don't have to sit in a class for 
three hours.

595
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:35,330
Yes,
I didn't like college.

596
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,613
It was up to me.
I'd go back in time and do you to me 

597
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,253
cost me a heck of a lot less than I 
probably would be a lot smarter to you 

598
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,160
about over 65,000
courses match that.

599
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,263
I went.
I wanted to learn a little bit about 

600
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:48,764
raising this music production software.
They've got this guy teaching me 

601
00:36:51,411 --> 00:36:52,910
courses.
They got a whole syllabus,

602
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:53,571
video,
video,

603
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:54,404
video,
video,

604
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,550
even those q and a's to help you 
navigate.

605
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,320
If you have a question,
you can drop a line to the professor.

606
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,423
What more do you need?
They've got this cool ass thing to the 

607
00:37:03,531 --> 00:37:04,364
transcription of the video.
If you want to find a specific place in 

608
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:07,544
a video,
you can search through the spoken video 

609
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:11,990
and find the right spot.
Oh,

610
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:15,950
I can't do that during a lecture.
I guess they'll just fail this test.

611
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,020
Guess what,
there's no tests because you're learning

612
00:37:18,021 --> 00:37:19,220
because you want to

613
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,380
ever heard of that called learning 
because you want to.

614
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,260
Yeah,

628
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:07,390
You got nothing to lose except 
knowledge,

629
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,540
which you need a lot of.
Go learn.

630
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,680
You hear the angels singing.
What is it that's on their breath?

631
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,170
That's right,
honey.

632
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,980
This has got to be one of the greatest 
plugin inventions of all time.

633
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,950
You plug it in,
right,

634
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,080
and with

635
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,913
a couple of clicks and it automatically 
searches the entire web for coupons as 

636
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:29,294
you shop.
It's saved me hundreds of dollars and 

637
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:34,420
youtube we'll.
I mean,

638
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,280
for example,
I just going and buying shoes.

639
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:38,620
I was ready to drop $300.
That was the price.

640
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:43,770
All of a sudden honey pops in like 
Batman and hand and they're like,

641
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,430
oh,
by the way,

642
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:46,264
we found a coupon code.
You just saved 50 bucks that you didn't 

643
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:50,680
think you were going to save until right
now.

644
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,620
What?
You're probably wondering how much money

645
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:54,850
can hunt?
He really saved me.

646
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,833
They actually crunched the numbers.
It turns out those of you who have 

647
00:38:57,611 --> 00:38:58,444
already downloaded honey for my link 
have already collectively saved over 

648
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:02,614
$102,000
in the past few months as an average of 

649
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:08,140
$25 per person.
What?

650
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,170
That's insane.
That is insane.

651
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,260
You may also be thinking of honey 
doesn't work on sites that I shop at.

652
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,510
The truth is,
honey works on over 30,000

653
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:18,130
sites including Amazon,
Ebay,

654
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:19,060
new egg,
razor,

655
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:20,170
Walmart,
and more.

656
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,000
So the more and 30,000
more Isla and one more today.

657
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:26,610
Then you'll find out one more.
Oh,

658
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,190
so the big question is,
how is money?

659
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,070
How was honey free?
Well,

660
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,200
there's no catchall.
Honey gets a small commission from sites

661
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:36,034
where honey saves you money so it's 
always free and that's really all there 

662
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:41,470
is to it.
They hook people up and people in short,

663
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,620
10 million people trust and use honey 
and save money all the fricking time.

664
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,730

That's God's minding the unbelievers who

00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:45,190
haven't yet used quip against all of my 
advice,

680
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,460
all of my pleading.
If you have not used quip,

681
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,460
if you have not treated yourself to this
great,

682
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:52,294
wonderful invention that I love,
this is going to be you being struck 

683
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:57,640
down by lightening,
by God's wrath.

684
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,850
Lightening coming out.
Quit is just essential,

685
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,713
my friends.
It's changed everything you know about 

686
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,953
oral hygiene and trust me,
you know very little and you don't need 

687
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:11,644
to know much because this is all unique.
This incredible vibrating toothbrush 

688
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:19,000
starts at just $25.
Wow.

689
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,953
Compared to other electric toothbrushes 
or the size of a car battery that 

690
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:24,970
started probably like at least 10,000,
maybe not that much,

691
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:25,804
but like a couple of hundred bucks.
You don't need all that because in this 

692
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,493
little cylinder is a vibrating little 
motor that's going to keep your teeth 

693
00:41:32,801 --> 00:41:35,870
clean and your breath smelling fresh.
Here's what it does.

694
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,390
First of all,
let's not get ahead of ourselves because

695
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:40,460
it's got these soft,
incredible bristles.

696
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,653
I hate when the bristle is too hard or 
too long and they irritate your gums 

697
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,040
because guess what guys?
You can get your teeth worked on,

698
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,230
but gums don't grow back

699
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,740
and that should horrify you.
Gums,

700
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:55,574
don't grow back true.
You need a good toothbrush or you have 

701
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:01,760
so much problems ahead for you.
So much,

702
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,640
dude,
this toothbrush,

703
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,980
this quip is everything.
Soft bristles.

704
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,770
You turn on the vibration,
it's three minutes of brushing.

705
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,080
Boom,
buck 50 on one side,

706
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,973
buck 50 on their side.
It vibrates impulses to let you know 

707
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,243
when to switch sides.
It basically encourages you times you 

708
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:23,600
out without you thinking to give 
yourself the perfect brush.

709
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,653
If you're not using this idol,
I can't help you anymore than I love 

710
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:31,910
this thing and I'm telling you it's

And so with that being said,

757
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:56,350
I think you are ready to play.
No.

758
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,170
Your main.
All right,

759
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,700
go the tents.
Music is beginning.

760
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:08,290
Stephen Music he put together.
What is donkeys?

761
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,620
Favorite video game?
Is it a mario?

762
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:18,961
60 four B book Worm Adventures Deluxe,
or see Aka Rena of time.

763
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,440
Steven.
Wow.

764
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:29,800
Take a moment.
I thought it would have been,

765
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,620
I thought it would have been next to for
Super Mario Brothers too,

766
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:38,490
but those are not receiving what?
What were the options again?

767
00:45:39,401 --> 00:45:39,850
One.
One more.

768
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:44,850
We've got a Mario Sixty four b book worm
adventures deluxe or see arena of time.

769
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:55,010
Well with or is we're going to go into 
promoters.

770
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,460
Was that Super Mario?
Sixty four.

771
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:05,910
Super Mario.
Sixty four and the answer is it was neck

772
00:46:06,671 --> 00:46:08,120
to.
You'll lose.

773
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:14,330
It wasn't.
It was actually Mario Sixty four.

774
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:15,574
So Eh Donkey.
I would have guessed all Corrina of 

775
00:46:21,221 --> 00:46:22,900
time,
but that would have been wrong,

776
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,793
but it's mario 64 through and through.
I guess your answer basically any Mario 

777
00:46:32,741 --> 00:46:37,741
game is the middle on this one question 
stuff one,

778
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,210
but you did?
Yeah.

779
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:49,290
Even.
Well Steven,

780
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,730
let's move it onto question two.
You're on the board.

781
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,070
You've got one point.
How you feeling?

782
00:46:54,071 --> 00:46:56,500
Good.
I'm feeling good.

783
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,760
I'm ready to go.
All right.

784
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:03,430
Bring it to the tense.
What is video game?

785
00:47:03,431 --> 00:47:06,100
Donkeys.
Favorite dish.

786
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:11,910
Is it a spaghetti and meatballs?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

787
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,590
Now,
Steven,

788
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,513
I haven't finished choices.
Do you want me to continue with the 

789
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,220
choices or you really want to lock that 
in?

790
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,763
Good music.
Good.

791
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,230
Again,
a little cocky here,

792
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:37,910
Stephen.
All right,

793
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:42,570
I'm going to lock you in.
You don't get the rest.

794
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,740
So you just wanted to say it.
People here,

795
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:55,770
like is it a spaghetti and meatballs?
Tacos or see pizza?

796
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:08,710
Getting me a little nervous.
Maybe it's deeper than the me.

797
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:10,890
Maybe it's maybe it's not spaghetti and 
meat balls.

798
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,791
Well,
Steven,

799
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:12,810
you wouldn't be.

800
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,940
Yeah,
there's other options than,

801
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,290
hey,
I'm going to stick with.

802
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,124
My answer was to Gideon pupils.
Even after you saw how they pushed back 

803
00:48:24,981 --> 00:48:29,981
on me as I drive by for the tension.
Is it spaghetti and meat balls?

804
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,660
Oh Shit.
A man of few words.

805
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,560
What is the real answer?
It was tacos the whole time.

806
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:51,870
He's a public knowledge.
We keep your Super Fan.

807
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:57,670
You may know that you made.
You look like a Taco guy.

808
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,580
What do you like on your Tacos?
What kind of Tacos you like,

809
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,340
Kelly about your dream talk.
Okay.

810
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,490
We're going to have some ground beef and
there some lettuce cheese.

811
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:10,403
Oh,
well then I'm going to put some salsa 

812
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,840
and Uhm,
what kind of salsa?

813
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,530
Some fresh salsa.

814
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,760
Sour cream guacamole on.
Okay.

815
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:27,943
What is your favorite fruit is tacos?
Why don't we just buy Mexican Food for 

816
00:49:33,421 --> 00:49:36,870
dinner?
Just like you're here in California.

817
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,090
You know what I'm saying?
There are Mexican place.

818
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,060
Do you usually just eat Mexican food 
when you're here?

819
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:48,560
Because you love Mexican food.
You,

820
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,630
you fucking Burrito since you've been 
here.

821
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:56,631
This is really.
He loves the old standby.

822
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:04,610
She likes chips in the beans and every 
breakfast.

823
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:10,020
Nachos and Keith.
This,

824
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,140
you know what I do though?
I have a twist.

825
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,543
I asked them to put the chips on the 
side because I don't like when they get 

826
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:17,214
so soggy.

827
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:22,960
Never ordered delivery.
Nachos up fool.

828
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:24,943
You know what I mean?
There's nothing sadder than a socking 

829
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,860
soggy Nachos.
Right?

830
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,180
Steven,
can I get an amen?

831
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,240
Thank you.
Does that for me or for me?

832
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:40,410
Isn't it just a general cricket?
Thank you.

833
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:43,783
Let's just get Mexican food.
Do you fuck with any other Mexican 

834
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:48,770
dishes back to the game?
Well,

835
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:56,710
hold on a sec.
We're excited about something before you

836
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:00,680
eat.
Would you fuck with Burritos,

837
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:01,670
ideas,
you?

838
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:06,170
You're talking strictly.
I'd do it on your Mexican food.

839
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:11,530
Number one cuisine.
Why don't you guys live in la?

840
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:18,970
You're Mexican food boy.
I've been to Mexico to go see them.

841
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,550
What's your favorite cuisine?
Oh man,

842
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,900
that's a tough one.
Honestly,

843
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,150
my answer is Tacos.

844
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:33,190
Just say no,
you're right.

845
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,240
Exactly.
You got to get through the layers here.

846
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:47,290
Do you find it to be do like me posed 
steven.

847
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,900
You're know.
I don't love it,

848
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,170
but not really.
No,

849
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,790
it's really.
It's an overhead dish.

850
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,300
It's really on the chef.
You know,

851
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:00,051
you gotta.
You gotta.

852
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:01,800
Bring that spice.
You gotta.

853
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,820
Bring that a little right there with Ya.
We're all.

854
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:20,021
We're all right there with.
All right,

855
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,870
so what are we at?
We have one point on the board.

856
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,040
Keeps going.
Yeah,

857
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:30,290
we've got to make that sound.
So Steven,

858
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,453
let's go back to the.

859
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:38,170
We got one point.
We got one strike.

860
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,593
Not The word lifeline.
Well he's got three tries to get two 

861
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:44,570
more.
Okay.

862
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:45,543
He doesn't have a lifeline,
but chances are he's going to win this 

863
00:52:49,001 --> 00:52:51,430
phone.
You know what I mean?

864
00:52:51,431 --> 00:52:53,350
We'd like to do favors,
but if you,

865
00:52:53,351 --> 00:52:55,780
if you miss all of them,
there's not much I can do it for you.

866
00:52:58,410 --> 00:52:59,243
I mean,
I assume that you want this brand new 

867
00:53:01,241 --> 00:53:04,390
galaxy s nine plus is a thousand dollar 
phone topical line.

868
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:08,110
You want this?
It is the best phone on the market and a

869
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,400
Samsung.
Wow.

870
00:53:09,401 --> 00:53:11,110
What a great company.
Loved them a lot.

871
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,810
Jason looks like he wants one.
Do you want this?

872
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,330
I get him.
If he gets it,

873
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,310
that's the deal.
That's the real deal.

874
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:24,560
Statements.
You not rising.

875
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:29,220
Question number three,
what race is donkey?

876
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,313
A Puerto Rican.
Be Black or to see what it all comes 

877
00:53:36,811 --> 00:53:38,790
down to this.
That's not true.

878
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,270
You have 10 seconds to go beyond the 
meeting.

879
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:46,390
Right?
And second,

880
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,090
the meme is black.

881
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:53,680
I'll let you know what.
Take your time.

882
00:53:53,681 --> 00:53:54,730
You're.
I see her in it.

883
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,270
I want to hear your thought process.
Puerto Rican,

884
00:53:58,271 --> 00:53:59,104
black or white.

885
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,350
Well,
my thought processes is a meme is black.

886
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:03,440
So,
so,

887
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,820
so the Nemea answered to answer black,
right?

888
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,650
Um,
and to be honest,

889
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,940
if it could just be honest,
I kind of,

890
00:54:09,941 --> 00:54:11,260
I did think that you were black,
white,

891
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:12,094
whatever.

892
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:13,883
I totally was disappointed.
A little disappointed if I'm being 

893
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,150
honest.
When I found out who was a white guy.

894
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,023
Yeah.

895
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,870
So I don't know if I should answer white
or black.

896
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,793
Well,
no,

897
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:26,170
I'm not looking for a real answer.
Yeah,

898
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:32,140
it's not a I,
I would have to go quite wrong.

899
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:39,050
Gimme a boom.

900
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:46,660
The real answer.
A black obviously do not have eyes.

901
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,770
He's a black man.
No,

902
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,950
actually the real answer is Puerto 
Rican.

903
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,350
No.

904
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:54,210
Oh boy.
No.

905
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,300
It's white.
You are right.

906
00:54:55,301 --> 00:54:56,134
You are correct.

907
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,310
You have two points that you were on the
board.

908
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:11,150
You are looking really good.
That was a tough one.

909
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:14,090
Yeah.
That had me stressing.

910
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,660
I wasn't sure what the answer was and 
I've answered in front of me like shit.

911
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:24,210
A lot of soul music.
Alright.

912
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,530
These last two are honestly so easy.
If you get the.

913
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:31,140
If you get no,
here we go.

914
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,200
Let me,
let me,

915
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,160
let me play the music now.

916
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:40,200
Here we go.
What game did donkey get?

917
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:45,201
Famous playing that later band him and 
has since rapidly declined in popularity

918
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:50,510
to almost complete obscurity a game no 
one cares about or plays today.

919
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,403
What is the name of that awful forgotten
gay and that is fallen off the face of 

920
00:55:56,491 --> 00:55:59,550
the planet and has basically zero 
players.

921
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,650
What is the name of that game?

922
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,360
Is there an ABC choice?

923
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:10,110
There is.
There is a CS.

924
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,953
Go a B League of legends.
It's almost as if I forgot the name of 

925
00:56:20,221 --> 00:56:25,221
it or see Dota two.
We've got to get to the bed though.

926
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,430
I'm ready for it.

927
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,690
What'd you say?
League of legends.

928
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:38,843
Yes.

929
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:45,100
I feel like I'm trying to League of 
legends.

930
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,750
It's almost as if I barely,

931
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,720
you know,
in a way it's like who like.

932
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:54,040
Do people still play that game though?
I mean seriously.

933
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:54,874
Yeah.
Yeah.

934
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,440
Only in like China,
right?

935
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,190
Well they didn't even have like Dj 
Khaled come in anymore.

936
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,840
Right.
Overwatch got DJ count money now.

937
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,470
But like you used to be known for 
playing league,

938
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:11,590
but now I feel like that's ancient 
history.

939
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:14,620
Like isn't that feel good that you got 
away from that kind of videos?

940
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:19,960
It was a big change.
Was that,

941
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,913
I mean,
were you thinking about getting away 

942
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:23,374
from making those kinds of videos for a 
long time or was it just like they were 

943
00:57:27,101 --> 00:57:29,950
dicks and you fucked off kind of like a 
rash decision,

944
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:34,280
but it was first basket area.
He was just like,

945
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,550
I was really scared that he was going to
like,

946
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,010
regret drastic change right away,
but he is just like,

947
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,120
well,
I was scared.

948
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:43,983
Is like,
well there was a bunch of people who 

949
00:57:46,591 --> 00:57:47,424
were making league videos,
but that's kind of like a dead thing 

950
00:57:49,111 --> 00:57:49,944
now,
isn't it?

951
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,720
It wasn't really like it's on the 
downhill,

952
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,880
but it's still stolen.
Rises,

953
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,450
continues to rise.
By the way,

954
00:58:00,451 --> 00:58:03,810
Stephen,
congratulations to you.

955
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,330
We don't even need to read the fifth 
question,

956
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,070
which frankly isn't really a good 
question.

957
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,520
Anyone three?
Yeah.

958
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,003
You're a winner one.
This brand new Samsung Galaxy s nine 

959
00:58:15,811 --> 00:58:17,840
plus.
What phone are you currently?

960
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,953
Uh,
I'm using an iphone and it doesn't work 

961
00:58:21,901 --> 00:58:25,930
very well up.
Oh yeah.

962
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:27,623
Mash.
That thing was to send us back the 

963
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:34,680
cement you sent back to match,
but I've heard.

964
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:36,503
No,
I'm kidding.

965
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,470
Thank you for calling in.
Stephen.

966
00:58:38,471 --> 00:58:41,500
Thank you for playing.
Thank you for being a great contestant,

967
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:47,310
a sewer of donkey mythology.
Thank you so much.

968
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,570
Make sure you stay on the line.

969
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:52,910
Right.
Love it.

970
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,080
I was talking with you guys before.
Know your man,

971
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,210
which by the way,
so much fun.

972
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,590
That was scary for a minute.
You know you're still on the line.

973
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:02,700
Jesus.
God,

974
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,930
You keep messing with this guy for 
Steven.

975
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,070
We had liked that.
Fun here.

976
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,093
Like that.
Okay.

977
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:15,510
Guys at the ice cream,
you know,

978
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:19,550
they keep giving you an ice cube.
And then the flip side,

979
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,220
at what point

980
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,320
do you just walk away from that 
situation?

981
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:27,110
Because it is pretty familiar.
I would have probably left daily.

982
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,400
Well,
not from this.

983
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:31,340
No,
but I'm talking about,

984
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:32,223
you know,
let me a street vendor like trick I 

985
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:39,290
guess,
but I think you know what you're getting

986
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:40,340
into.
What would you call that?

987
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:45,370
Ice Cream prankster scream like street,
like trash thing.

988
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:50,880
It's always like talking about really 
got to fight,

989
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:56,220
scream trick.
Like an ice cream truck guy.

990
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,760
His truck people.
Dude,

991
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:02,840
this shit's crazy.
Oh yeah.

992
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,750
Oh yeah.
Lots of ideas,

993
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,960
by the way,
I don't want that cone for my pants.

994
01:00:12,961 --> 01:00:14,220
You know what I'm saying?
Like Shit,

995
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,940
you know,
I don't know.

996
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:23,890
Oh Nice.

997
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,240
He's going to get it for real.
You're loading it up.

998
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,340
Loaded up.
Idiot.

999
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:45,720
The best act ever pulled it away that 
this poor guy,

1000
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,300
by the way,
by the time he gets to eat it,

1001
01:01:03,301 --> 01:01:05,130
it's been in his pocket.
It's been on stage.

1002
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:06,223
It's like I don't want that ice cream.
First one I've seen where they smeared 

1003
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:10,814
it on it.

1004
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:12,820
So in short,
that's what.

1005
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,740
That's how what we did initially.
Yeah,

1006
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:19,210
that is.
I'm trying to be annoying but funny.

1007
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:25,920
Got To love those ice cream gentlemen in
a parallel universe.

1008
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:28,000
But do you think you could pull that 
off?

1009
01:01:28,001 --> 01:01:33,001
I feel like you're a gentleman and I 
carola universe that we're talking about

1010
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:37,390
dinner.
I didn't know.

1011
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,780
You're so passionate about Mexican food.
I'm very passionate about Mexican food.

1012
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,470
Yeah,
your Taco,

1013
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:47,650
Taco master.
He knows how to make really good salsa.

1014
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,633
Yeah,
Dude.

1015
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,550
Nobody.
Nobody knows that that's like a.

1016
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:57,010
that's like a desired skill among shit.
Well,

1017
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,830
I.
So I have one specific salsa.

1018
01:01:59,831 --> 01:02:02,680
I'm very good at the red and all this 
mystery stuff.

1019
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:06,430
I'm not very good at,
but I make a great avocado green salsa.

1020
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,380
That is excellent.
But I'm.

1021
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,730
I'm thinking we should just hoarder.

1022
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,150
Yeah,
I'm saying get some Nachos.

1023
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,850
You can't order Nachos?
No,

1024
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:23,851
don't order not just to get them to the 
chip.

1025
01:02:24,071 --> 01:02:29,030
Separate Nachos with chips separate.
That'd be kind of making order,

1026
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,800
but I was just talking about how this 
morning I'm so tired.

1027
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:32,634
I woke up because I've been preparing 
for you guys just visit last time we 

1028
01:02:35,281 --> 01:02:36,640
were here,
we had we cooked dinner.

1029
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:37,543
It was so much fun.
Amazing chef cooked us up to the 

1030
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,270
current.
You guys were loving it.

1031
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,760
It sounds like that's less.
I made it so fun.

1032
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:55,800
Cooking for people who are appreciative.
I was like,

1033
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:56,634
damn,
I'm going to pull all the stops for 

1034
01:02:57,521 --> 01:03:00,150
these guys.
So I was thinking,

1035
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:01,500
well,
I woke up at 5:00

1036
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,620
AM this morning.
I bake chocolate chip cookies,

1037
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:05,003
only smoke up your ass.
These aren't saying he's so good and I 

1038
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,360
was going to bring some for the guy,
the guys,

1039
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,333
Dan,
but I was like not enough cookies for 

1040
01:03:16,681 --> 01:03:17,514
honestly,
and I bring that up just to make them 

1041
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,960
feel that I bring that up because I want
you to know that you guys are so cookie.

1042
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:32,600
Sorry.
I'm sorry,

1043
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:36,480
but the new thing I'm working on is 
baking.

1044
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,530
I'm working on learning how to make 
sourdough bread.

1045
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:46,170
Tell me about that and it's like it's so
intense and it's so time consuming,

1046
01:03:46,171 --> 01:03:51,120
but it's a good starter.
I made my own starter from scratch.

1047
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:56,910
I think it's in a good shape,
really good bread and last Friday it was

1048
01:03:56,911 --> 01:03:59,520
like professional.
While I had made two breads.

1049
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:01,740
One was great,
one was like perfect.

1050
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,460
The first one,
the second one was a literal brick,

1051
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:11,550
but still it was like you could break.
The flavor was good.

1052
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,940
As far as breaks go,
pretty important.

1053
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:18,300
Structure was off,
so I can't wait.

1054
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:22,470
I started getting that starter.
She's my favorite food.

1055
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:24,960
I did.
Anyway.

1056
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,390
I rolled the dough.
I proved it,

1057
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,300
proved it some more.
It's in the proven basket now.

1058
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:31,134
It's in the fridge.

1059
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:39,223
I've got it.
Actually this one I'm super proud of 

1060
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:48,500
because the um,
the starter was bubbly and ice crash.

1061
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:49,603
It was like really good smell and 
texture and this morning I was kneading 

1062
01:04:53,971 --> 01:04:55,980
the dough and it was just looking really
good.

1063
01:04:56,910 --> 01:05:01,170
And so I did a little twist because I 
didn't want to over prove it by the way.

1064
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,033
Proving people don't know is when you 
leave the dough out for several hours 

1065
01:05:06,421 --> 01:05:07,254
and the yeast eats the flower so it 
starts to rise and make it fluffy and 

1066
01:05:10,851 --> 01:05:12,630
turn.
It's our team does all the magic.

1067
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:16,170
So you prove it,
but I didn't want to over prove it.

1068
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,760
So I popped it in the fridge.
That's the twist.

1069
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,150
I don't know if it's going to work,
but it should.

1070
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:26,500
I'm not going to work if I buy into that
and it's terrible.

1071
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:27,793
I'm to,
I'm going to feel horrible knowing the 

1072
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:35,023
slider.

1073
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:38,373
I really liked those.
So wholesome because Isla is the 

1074
01:05:40,931 --> 01:05:41,764
pickiest eater ever.
She loves bread and the bread here in 

1075
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:46,570
America is so bad.
I have no problem with them.

1076
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:47,860
Bread here?
Yeah.

1077
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:48,810
Noticed

1078
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:52,760
and define Brenda.
She'll just eat a role,

1079
01:05:52,761 --> 01:05:53,680
but.
So yeah,

1080
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:58,580
I will just eat plain know the baker I 
worked out was also a sourdough bakery.

1081
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,210
Specifically salary.
No.

1082
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,220
Nice.
Yeah,

1083
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,570
so I got a lot of free bread there.

1084
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,980
Thing that,
that we particularly hate.

1085
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,780
Isla is that there's so much sugar.
Like if you go to the store,

1086
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,990
bakeries have got it going on generally 
like in a good way,

1087
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:15,123
but at the store it's like I've noticed 
you'll get a hot dog bun and it's got 

1088
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:22,230
six grams of sugar in it.
Yeah,

1089
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,640
that's true.
I don't know.

1090
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:26,950
We try to buy like local bakeries.
That's.

1091
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,830
Yeah.
We don't really have a baker in Paris.

1092
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:32,330
So you guys are on the.
You guys are killing it on breads.

1093
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:38,640
We try to go to the grocery store.
They don't even have like local bake,

1094
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,540
like bakery stuff at your grocery store.
So they always.

1095
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,880
They're always dry.
Yeah.

1096
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,700
Browse like Ralph's make their own bread
and it's like,

1097
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,530
you know,
the rouse lady,

1098
01:06:50,531 --> 01:06:53,030
she doesn't really care what's going on 
at that level.

1099
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,540
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1100
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,610
Like the bakery fresh,
not like artisan.

1101
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,790
They're fucking around back there.
They don't take.

1102
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,820
They don't take it on the ceiling.
Don't take it.

1103
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:06,253
You know what I'm doing?
I've got oil on my hands so it doesn't 

1104
01:07:08,201 --> 01:07:09,550
stick.
I'm neat.

1105
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,400
I've needed this dough.
I don't think they're doing that.

1106
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,270
Definitely not doing that.
So it's so much.

1107
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:20,000
Sun is coming up.
I'm in the kitchen on wedding oil,

1108
01:07:20,001 --> 01:07:23,360
on my hands.
I need sleeping.

1109
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:29,180
I'll wake up upstairs.
I'm downstairs sweating.

1110
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:32,960
Needed oil on my hands.
You know what I'm saying?

1111
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:34,503
How come this is a very unusual.
It unusual because I knew you guys were 

1112
01:07:40,281 --> 01:07:43,370
coming and I want it to.
I'm wanting to do the right thing,

1113
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,500
but the question is now

1114
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,500
and I've learned that you were such a 
Mexican food fanatic,

1115
01:07:48,501 --> 01:07:49,334
which I appreciate so much is because I 
was originally planning to cook some 

1116
01:07:52,971 --> 01:07:55,910
filet minions and all my.
I'm going to give you the option.

1117
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:57,240
I think

1118
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:02,240
probably just follow up with my follow 
up.

1119
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:13,610
You got a couple of Chubby.
This is good edge.

1120
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:15,890
Uh,
you guys can have a side conversation.

1121
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:20,930
Me and Jason could talk all day about 
this kind of Hokey.

1122
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,600
Like my bread,
because you see,

1123
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:26,270
it seems like you're in deep in the 
bread world,

1124
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:27,800
so this is going to be a real test for 
me.

1125
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:31,250
I'm going to eat it plain.
I'm going to eat it with butter.

1126
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:35,930
Wow.
Nutella we're prepared.

1127
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,070
You're not.
We bought,

1128
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:41,330
we bought,
we bought butter.

1129
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:42,350
Salted,
of course.

1130
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,420
French.
Very nice.

1131
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:49,840
And Jelly cream cheese obviously.
Yeah.

1132
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:54,200
I don't usually have cream cheese on it.
What's a killer one?

1133
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:59,500
Cream cheese and jelly sandwich.
That's right.

1134
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,313
It's really good.
So back to the meats because the bread 

1135
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:11,650
was Scott sorta started dinner and no,
we're one course down.

1136
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:15,770
Don't jump the gun.

1137
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:19,813
So I think that my specialty is 
definitely cooking steaks so I can do 

1138
01:09:25,311 --> 01:09:26,900
that.
But also,

1139
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:30,780
I mean Mexican food teco wrongs steak 
Tacos.

1140
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:32,860
You can vary.
Yeah,

1141
01:09:32,861 --> 01:09:33,800
you can vary.
Go wrong.

1142
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:34,663
There's a lot of bad places.
So if we order there's a chance it's 

1143
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:38,534
going to be bad.
It's probably going to be good to ask 

1144
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:44,770
because I'm Mexican food in Wisconsin.
I can't be that.

1145
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:50,560
Is there a good Mexican food and there's
some good people out there.

1146
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:53,650
Are they Mexican cooking?
Okay.

1147
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:57,290
They produce is not as good.
That said,

1148
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,940
no,
Dan,

1149
01:09:58,941 --> 01:10:03,941
are you speaking from Mexican food and 
Wisconsin and I might be speaking out of

1150
01:10:04,251 --> 01:10:06,290
turn because I've never been to 
Wisconsin,

1151
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:11,460
but probably not.
By the way,

1152
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:15,560
I like the urgency of you to send me a 
DM.

1153
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:21,160
No private life about Mexican food.
So why don't we do both?

1154
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:30,460
Sometime we should do both.

1155
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:38,260
That'd be a fun,
interesting video almost.

1156
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,030
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1157
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:44,760
If people are listening to this,
if anybody's left lists,

1158
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,033
they're going to love that one on the 
best videos was made a really great 

1159
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:53,900
video about like Burrito density.
Did you see?

1160
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:58,580
That was so good.
He made a video analyzing the content of

1161
01:10:58,581 --> 01:11:02,980
Burritos in San Diego and it was so 
fucking great.

1162
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:07,670
Opens up the brooders and analyzes.
So good.

1163
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:10,030
Yeah.
The dedication,

1164
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,183
the conclusion.
Well he was analyzing like three 

1165
01:11:13,201 --> 01:11:14,034
different major chains and like if 
they're making them right because 

1166
01:11:17,161 --> 01:11:18,540
sometimes,
believe it or not,

1167
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:19,900
they put French fries,
embryos,

1168
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:24,880
and just kind of a weird twist.
Oh No.

1169
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:26,070
You know,
you know,

1170
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:31,071
you get your burger reader in Korea.
We Got Burger Rico.

1171
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:32,183
What it sounds like,
some sounds like some Wisconsin and 

1172
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:42,600
that's so tough.
So do they put ketchup in it?

1173
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:43,434
Like my nightmare details.
If it's really dedicated to being a 

1174
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:49,944
hamburger.
I have a problem in a Burrito with some 

1175
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:58,230
French fries in there.
Probably that's not okay.

1176
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:04,890
There's a lot of them know it's a wrap.
It's a wrap.

1177
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:06,550
Yeah,
it's just her wrap.

1178
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,540
If you call it a wrap,
it's much easier for me to handle.

1179
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:13,170
I don't know if I liked it that much.

1180
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:18,150
I was like,
I will not eat that.

1181
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,550
You can do it to the mistake and I hated
it.

1182
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:30,060
I hated it,
but I don't think I'm the same way.

1183
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:33,250
I hate it and I'll eat it either.
On the other hand,

1184
01:12:33,251 --> 01:12:34,770
I don't like it.
I don't even touch it.

1185
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,710
I'll start.
I'm like,

1186
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:42,711
yeah,
that's why we look like I'm actually,

1187
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,100
I'm not kidding.
I eat two portions of every meal or like

1188
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,620
one and a half.
It's pretty bad.

1189
01:12:49,621 --> 01:12:51,750
I ended up starving.
If I.

1190
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:56,750
If it doesn't look perfect to me.
Not that it's not that I want to do it,

1191
01:12:57,811 --> 01:12:59,790
I just can't.
Like I can't eat it.

1192
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:01,830
I hear you.
It's just,

1193
01:13:01,831 --> 01:13:03,600
you know,
you're built from a different cloth.

1194
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:08,880
I have a problem.
I've my food falling apart and then it's

1195
01:13:08,881 --> 01:13:09,714
too messy for me to eat on time.
We're at the restaurant and the waiter 

1196
01:13:16,961 --> 01:13:19,350
is going by and I'm like,
here give me that.

1197
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,213
Like she was all done with their burger 
and it was like the whole burger was 

1198
01:13:22,171 --> 01:13:25,340
still there with all this stuff and I've
had my whole plate is clear.

1199
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:26,183
I'm like,
give me that.

1200
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:27,203
And right when the waiters going,
I'm just taking her whole plate and 

1201
01:13:30,001 --> 01:13:30,834
start eating it.
And I was just sitting there like I'm 

1202
01:13:37,001 --> 01:13:42,001
done at.
There's no shame in it could look funny.

1203
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,110
You just walked by and was like,
what's going?

1204
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,843
Oh my God.

1205
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:57,890
Oh mcn abuse abusive food.
Quarter your time is up.

1206
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:05,760
Giving me a burger.
I'm sure I'd do that for you.

1207
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,690
But like I,
I'll,

1208
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,040
I,
I can hate an eat so easily.

1209
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:16,300
Like I'll not even like it and it's bad 
for me and it's super high calorie.

1210
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,880
All fucking eat that shit before you 
look blinks.

1211
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:25,300
That's the worst on like this bed with 
it tastes bad and it's also bad for you.

1212
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:27,450
That is the worst.
You're just,

1213
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:32,610
you still eat it,
but that's what Disney is all about.

1214
01:14:33,411 --> 01:14:36,370
It's like the corn dog,
you know the strange.

1215
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:41,530
Like I think I kicked on a corn dog.
I felt pretty bad about that,

1216
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,920
but it's like 2000 cows.

1217
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:47,801
Oh,
let me look up.

1218
01:14:47,801 --> 01:14:52,801
How many calories in that weird was the 
leg?

1219
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:58,203
No,
I got.

1220
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,680
I did get the leg by the way.
Oh,

1221
01:14:59,681 --> 01:15:01,920
you got one?
Okay.

1222
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:02,883
This says 400 calories.
I'm here to say that's a fucking 

1223
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:06,650
outright.
A lot bullshit.

1224
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:08,913
That is an outright monstrous live.
This corn dog is this size is threader 

1225
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:17,710
serving size.
Oh,

1226
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:22,820
that's vendors like five servings.
Okay.

1227
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,350
Yeah,
I gotta find out.

1228
01:15:26,351 --> 01:15:27,184
I gotta get to the bottom of this.
Can you guys find out what the calories 

1229
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:33,860
are important?
That's a monstrous fucking filthy.

1230
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:35,283
Like this big.
Like for anyone who has not had it and 

1231
01:15:38,271 --> 01:15:40,580
it's deep fried corn.
So awesome.

1232
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,110
I feel like that's 1200 calories.
Lee,

1233
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:45,970
do you guys hear about.

1234
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:51,450
There was this megabucks jackpot was 
$543,

1235
01:15:51,451 --> 01:15:54,470
million bucks.
No Damn.

1236
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,233
So this was like a huge Jackpot in 
California and I'm 11 employees at one 

1237
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:06,530
store all went in together on tickets 
and they won.

1238
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:08,203
So basically all of the employees at 
this one place are now overnight worth 

1239
01:16:13,281 --> 01:16:15,620
like 60 million apiece.

1240
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:19,520
That's when I was just thinking like 
that place is going out of business,

1241
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:25,350
like everybody's fucking gone.
It's such a funny situation.

1242
01:16:26,151 --> 01:16:28,730
It's like this is what it's going to be 
like.

1243
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:36,070
That's what it's going to be like this.
But it's funny to think like that.

1244
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:40,000
They're all playing the lottery so they 
can never see it

1245
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:43,830
each other ever again.
You know,

1246
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,620
these fucking guys,
11 of them

1247
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:49,613
got that article said,
every single one of them said they have 

1248
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,940
no intention on quitting.
Get Real.

1249
01:16:53,941 --> 01:16:58,941
What do they come on?
Like a financial services.

1250
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:03,710
I really love my job as a receptionist.
I'm worth it

1251
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:09,080
a million dollars now and I have no 
intention of leaving job as a

1252
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,813
receptionist.

1253
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:13,700
People really like going out to work and
it's like,

1254
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:19,410
I know my mom is like that.
Like on Saturday she can't in Israel,

1255
01:17:19,631 --> 01:17:20,464
you go back to work on Sunday,
so on Sunday that she can't wait for 

1256
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:24,800
Sunday.
Like I've never heard anyone.

1257
01:17:24,801 --> 01:17:24,930
Okay.

1258
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:28,890
Say That your family have one day off.
She says,

1259
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:29,753
well,

1260
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:32,440
she always says I can't wait for Sunday.
I want to go

1261
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:33,563
serious.
Yeah.

1262
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:39,300
Different,
different alien race.

1263
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:41,200
What the hell sent you an alien right 
there.

1264
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:47,280
You think if your mom wants 29 million 
US dollars?

1265
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:51,690
She would work at Delta still.
I feel like she would say that,

1266
01:17:51,691 --> 01:17:53,760
but I wouldn't believe it.
No effing way.

1267
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:57,810
These guys,
I think they need to follow up with them

1268
01:17:57,811 --> 01:18:01,840
in like two weeks off there be will be 
gone after the interview.

1269
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,180
Are you kidding me?
What's that?

1270
01:18:03,181 --> 01:18:05,580
Check hits the bank.
Twenty $9 billion.

1271
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:11,920
Not what?
Just really financially conservative.

1272
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:15,080
Take it easy.
You got to conserve.

1273
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:16,470
Well,
they have a option.

1274
01:18:16,471 --> 01:18:21,471
All 11 of them have this option between 
they can receive 18 is this right?

1275
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:25,500
Then $18 million per year.
Oh,

1276
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:26,343
one point.
6 million per year forever or a measly 

1277
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,240
$29 million pop.

1278
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,700
That's crazy.
The one point six,

1279
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:43,920
take the lump.
Take alumni lump all day long.

1280
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,940
Because I don't trust.
Take the money and run inflation.

1281
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:56,070
Take the money and run.
I don't want anyone owing me money.

1282
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:02,750
I take the loan every time I win the 
lotto.

1283
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:08,130
You know it's funny.
By the way,

1284
01:19:08,131 --> 01:19:09,990
I bought a ticket.
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

1285
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:13,040
I bought four tickets.
I dropped $10 on that.

1286
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:14,663
Why did they tons of tickets probably.
They probably pulled in and bought a 

1287
01:19:18,481 --> 01:19:22,650
bunch,
but think just like for they bought,

1288
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,950
they only like a handful of doesn't 
achieve bucks.

1289
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:30,330
Spent $10,
bucks a piece.

1290
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:35,490
So 11 people,
so 22 bucks.

1291
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:37,170
They probably had 11.
That's a decent amount.

1292
01:19:37,171 --> 01:19:39,900
Oh God,
that's crazy.

1293
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:43,770
Have you guys ever played the lottery?
You ever buy ticket and just fantasize?

1294
01:19:43,771 --> 01:19:46,170
What if you were like a billionaire?
Overnight?

1295
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,110
I never ever bought him.
Really?

1296
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:52,260
My mom used to always do the same where 
she buy,

1297
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,153
when the lottery get big,
she'd buy ticket and then for like the 

1298
01:19:55,471 --> 01:20:00,471
whole week she would just talk about 
fantasizing about the ball for the whole

1299
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:13,010
week.
Like I would move to Florida and I would

1300
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:19,581
do with the kitchen this way and like 
really extended fantasy,

1301
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:24,420
started getting you excited and file 
maybe we are going to win.

1302
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:29,440
My Dad used to own and kiosk and really 
I didn't know your dad was a key ops man

1303
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,000
and I don't know if you know and that is
here,

1304
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:37,470
like if I got a gun.
So they,

1305
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:38,703
they did a lottery there and I just 
remember all the old people going in 

1306
01:20:42,821 --> 01:20:46,790
there and like placing their bats and 
they're so serious about it.

1307
01:20:46,791 --> 01:20:51,791
There's like combos and like I'll do the
acs and the ACS Combo and I dunno,

1308
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:55,730
I ain't gonna even know what it means 
even though it's completely random.

1309
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:00,560
I know the people that when like they're
doing their exam,

1310
01:21:00,561 --> 01:21:02,000
you know,
like they're all,

1311
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:07,590
it's been three days since the seven 
weeks.

1312
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:08,523
First number on that.
Can you imagine though that amount of 

1313
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:14,060
money to win?
It's so obscene.

1314
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:18,290
Half a billion dollars for literally 
doing nothing.

1315
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:20,263
It's hard to say no to that.
That's where the Jackpot is so high 

1316
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:27,640
because so many people in bond 
overnight,

1317
01:21:27,951 --> 01:21:28,784
one of the richest people in the world.
How does that differ from what are 

1318
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,570
weird?
That's how it works.

1319
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:35,960
They're just.
They make money by people buying tickets

1320
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,920
makes the jackpot larger.
It's actually the lawyer always one.

1321
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:44,020
Obviously the lottery,
a lottery every night.

1322
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:48,290
Actually the lotteries,
the interesting thing it was,

1323
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:49,850
I don't remember where I learned about 
this,

1324
01:21:49,851 --> 01:21:54,851
but it was made to be a public service,
so like it's like a voluntary tax.

1325
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:56,323
Literally that's how they thought about 
it and it originated in like Japan and 

1326
01:21:59,091 --> 01:22:01,040
so you will be like,
give us a book,

1327
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:05,690
have a chance to win a prize,
but the money goes to civic services,

1328
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:07,043
so like they use the lottery money to 
fund schools and local shit and that's 

1329
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:13,330
still what they do today if you'd like.
The California lottery is a.

1330
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:17,160
is a public fund used for the benefit?
The welfare of the gut?

1331
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:19,570
I don't know why I always thought it 
interesting.

1332
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:22,733
It's interesting.
It's so like it's a California state 

1333
01:22:29,331 --> 01:22:31,390
lottery,
so it's run by the APP.

1334
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:32,910
It.
I think it's the same.

1335
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:37,380
Well because I've seen like you'll see 
like an auditorium and it says the.

1336
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,350
It's a voluntary tax is literally a 
voluntary tax.

1337
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:44,960
Pretty cool.
Growing up,

1338
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:47,810
my dad always would tell me it's the 
idiot tax.

1339
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:52,850
That was another word,
but then whenever the Jackpot was huge,

1340
01:22:52,911 --> 01:22:53,744
like it was on this one,
he would still go buy a ticket like 

1341
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:57,030
that.
Well,

1342
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,730
my brother explained it to me,
Mr.

1343
01:22:58,820 --> 01:22:59,690
Science.
He goes,

1344
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:05,380
at a certain point when it gets so big,
you're actually statistically

1345
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:09,220
a favorable bet.
You know what I mean?

1346
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:14,940
Let's say you have like a one in 10 
million chance of winning and so usually

1347
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:19,180
let's say the price is 5 million bucks 
and you buy ticket,

1348
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,133
so that's not a statistically good.
Say if you put a dollar and you stand 

1349
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:27,020
the win half a billion,
then all the sudden,

1350
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,040
yeah,
yeah,

1351
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:34,530
maybe there's logic there.
You can't win if you don't play Nice.

1352
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:35,980
Yeah.
She didn't want one.

1353
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:41,050
Not No one wins.
Nobody went,

1354
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,750
oh,
I have a great video about the lottery.

1355
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:44,790
I want to watch with you guys.
Well,

1356
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:45,970
there's another story I want to talk 
about.

1357
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:47,890
Just cracked me up.

1358
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:50,730
Nela,
almond breeze,

1359
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,410
almond breeze.
You guys drink almond milk?

1360
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:53,640
Yeah.
Well you'll be.

1361
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:54,713
You'll be horrified to know that it's 
being recalled because there's actually 

1362
01:23:59,131 --> 01:24:01,530
a trace amount of real book in it.

1363
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:12,350
Even like some other day I was.
I had a big old bowl of honey smacks,

1364
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,820
like the cereal that I never eat.
I just picked it for some reason.

1365
01:24:16,821 --> 01:24:17,241
I'm like,
oh,

1366
01:24:17,241 --> 01:24:18,074
I'll have honey smacks.
And then like we're driving home from 

1367
01:24:19,551 --> 01:24:20,384
Milwaukee.
I'm like this fucking crazy radio 

1368
01:24:22,221 --> 01:24:25,100
stations.
Like on this goofy hip hop station,

1369
01:24:25,410 --> 01:24:26,740
Dj fresh,
fresh,

1370
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:28,343
just recalled honey smacks it.
Has Salmonella and it like what the 

1371
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:37,800
fuck?
Like a sub plot from Salmonella funds to

1372
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:48,830
throw and be like,
Oh,

1373
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:53,300
you thought I was going to Salmonella.
No,

1374
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:54,663
but isn't that fucking hilarious?
They're making all men milk a milk 

1375
01:24:59,211 --> 01:25:00,044
alternative and somehow real milk is 
slipping into how the hell does that 

1376
01:25:05,331 --> 01:25:10,331
happen?
One mission to not have milk,

1377
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:18,870
they're recalling 145,000
half gallons of almond milk because they

1378
01:25:18,871 --> 01:25:21,700
could contain actual milk.
Whoops.

1379
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:23,423
Why?
There's no information about why actual 

1380
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:30,540
milk got into the almond milk.
I tried to dig into it and just nobody.

1381
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,020
Nobody has any excuse.
It's like a great mystery.

1382
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:36,023
I just loved the idea of somebody going 
to buy almond milk because they're like 

1383
01:25:38,251 --> 01:25:41,370
a Vegan or something and there's just a 
trace amount of real milk.

1384
01:25:41,371 --> 01:25:46,200
It just like a little prankster,
like disgruntled worker.

1385
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,900
Just a little milk.
It's like,

1386
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:50,753
that's not like a little mistake.
That's like a fucking like a month of 

1387
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:57,270
shit.
How long does that go on?

1388
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:00,720
I Dunno know the recalling a lot of 
milk.

1389
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:03,120
And why does the almonds have to pay for
the,

1390
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:04,880
you know,
how many,

1391
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,360
how many defenses almonds are going 
down.

1392
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:11,293
Jason was freaking out about the cereal.
He thought they were like rubbing raw 

1393
01:26:14,361 --> 01:26:15,600
chicken on the serialized

1394
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:21,340
cereal.
Cereal wasn't a cook,

1395
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,720
but what touch like every piece of the 
cereal or like what?

1396
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:25,554
How dirty ass guy at the factory who 
probably takes a shit cooks chicken 

1397
01:26:30,871 --> 01:26:35,730
without washing his hands and he's 
handling the smacks just scooping him up

1398
01:26:35,731 --> 01:26:40,731
like raw chicken goop in your smacks.
Oh Man.

1399
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:43,350
I have a ton of videos to watch.
Jesus.

1400
01:26:43,351 --> 01:26:46,830
We're all over the place.
We talked about our dinner plans.

1401
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,080
Oh,
by the way,

1402
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:52,280
thank you for reminding me.
We're killing it.

1403
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:57,610
I think I'll get steaks and we'll order 
fucking Mexican food.

1404
01:26:58,190 --> 01:26:59,830
Going to be so good.
We've got cookies.

1405
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,460
I've got to make cocktails.
So you guys like Moscow Mules?

1406
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:05,913
Yes.

1407
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:11,100
We just got the 10 guts.
It's got breakfast,

1408
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,333
breeze

1409
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,550
kind.
They're all of a sudden.

1410
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:17,573
Oh,
I'm sorry that I like to put artists in 

1411
01:27:18,881 --> 01:27:21,830
bread and wake up at five.
Am You Isla?

1412
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:26,950
Sorry that I sound like a hipster while 
I'm literally sweating as the sun rises.

1413
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:30,380
Thank Leslie.
As sleep peacefully.

1414
01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:35,610
That is really hipster thing.
Speaking of the light was really nice to

1415
01:27:38,621 --> 01:27:43,621
wake up and have a fresh cookie.
Have a smell of chocolate chip cookies,

1416
01:27:45,171 --> 01:27:50,171
a wharf there up in the bar is going to 
expect that.

1417
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,470
It's a one day thing.
You guys are the sweetest couple ever.

1418
01:27:58,471 --> 01:27:59,830
Do you guys fight about anything ever?

1419
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,290
They don't last.
Like what?

1420
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:04,910
Do you guys fight about?
Disagreements?

1421
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:07,280
Like stupid,
stupid stuff.

1422
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,530
Yeah,
but then we just like laugh.

1423
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,760
Like if we look at it,
if we like make eye contact,

1424
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:17,370
get like woke up like really serious.
I go try to like look at each other,

1425
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,213
make

1426
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:23,520
that's really doesn't just let it go and
then it's over.

1427
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,050
Excuse me.
That shit.

1428
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:29,760
Yeah.
Maybe if we like separated and like went

1429
01:28:29,761 --> 01:28:30,594
in separate rooms or something.
We could have a bigger fight but we 

1430
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:38,890
never want to fight more.
We're working on.

1431
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:45,750
We went in.
I like the idea of you guys had a fight.

1432
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:48,430
Like maybe if we.
Jason,

1433
01:28:48,431 --> 01:28:50,170
maybe if you went in that room and I go 
into.

1434
01:28:50,490 --> 01:28:53,410
We could get angry at each other for a 
little longer.

1435
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:54,244
Yeah.
Probably not even send each other texts 

1436
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,150
like I'm hungry.

1437
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:04,590
That's usually when they like,
okay,

1438
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:08,140
I'm hungry.
All right,

1439
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:08,760
let's,
let's,

1440
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,580
let's squash this.

1441
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:12,290
Beef menial.
Always fight about food.

1442
01:29:12,291 --> 01:29:13,580
Pretty much.
Not Anymore.

1443
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:15,403
It used to be all we fought about like 
what you're telling her to eat or like 

1444
01:29:18,771 --> 01:29:19,740
where do you eat?
Because Ila,

1445
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,930
I don't know why we argue so much about 
it

1446
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:25,830
because like it's hard.
It's hard to tell.

1447
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:30,300
I come from like,
my mom usually cooks all the time,

1448
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:33,300
so growing up I only ate at home so I 
ate.

1449
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,640
I hate eating outside and

1450
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:36,863
I up the opposite.

1451
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,080
Okay.
That's all right.

1452
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:46,950
Ethan ate out like every time all day.
Right.

1453
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,000
That's as I understand it the same.
So that is why we would have a lot of

1454
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:56,450
like I wanted to eat out.
Yeah.

1455
01:29:56,451 --> 01:29:58,150
You don't like eating out,
you don't have anything else,

1456
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:02,030
but we don't really argue about it and 
as much anymore

1457
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:06,720
I've,
I've learned to do at home.

1458
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:09,450
We did our.
No,

1459
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:12,030
I'm kidding there.
Check this out.

1460
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,790
Speaking to the lottery story is about a
moment.

1461
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:17,460
It was after barb reddick and her 
nephew,

1462
01:30:17,461 --> 01:30:20,100
tyrone mcguinness,
picked up their big win.

1463
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:23,220
One point $2,000,000
chase the age Jack Pot,

1464
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:28,200
but it didn't take long for things to 
turn sour when both were handed separate

1465
01:30:28,201 --> 01:30:30,630
checks for $600,000.

1466
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:34,500
JCA sweeteners is going to court.
I've taken the car.

1467
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,393
That was my take was that I bought.
I bought it and now he's trying to say 

1468
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:45,700
we split.
I said split with the 50 slash 50 now.

1469
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:46,593
But no chase ca's I've taken them to 
court and I'm getting my lawyer 

1470
01:30:48,981 --> 01:30:49,814
tomorrow.

1471
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:53,010
Both names are on the winning tickets 
than a critic says.

1472
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:56,850
We agreed to split the consolation prize
and not the Jackpot.

1473
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,350
If the ace was drawn,

1474
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:01,610
I put his name on the thing.
I told them for a good lock.

1475
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:05,810
They always lie,
but I'm taking them to court.

1476
01:31:05,811 --> 01:31:07,670
I'm serious.
I'm getting a lawyer tomorrow.

1477
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:12,730
Who's name was tyrone you by the time I 
love it.

1478
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,620
What is name for good luck and I won.

1479
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:21,470
He works his name work.
Do you got the good life?

1480
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:23,113
Like damn.

1481
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:25,320
Get a little fucking money

1482
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:27,303
instantly to.
You always hear these stories of 

1483
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,960
families falling apart over this,
but like over the course of neither.

1484
01:31:31,961 --> 01:31:36,961
There's not like 30 seconds later 
something else is going on with,

1485
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:39,220
but if any,
if it gives them money,

1486
01:31:39,221 --> 01:31:40,660
how is he going to enjoy it?
No,

1487
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,170
he's out.
He's fucking piece now.

1488
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:45,140
That's 600,000.
What is she,

1489
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:46,310
by the way?
This whole.

1490
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,800
I don't know where they live.
Like I assume not anymore expensive.

1491
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:53,370
Like what is this lady going to do with 
600,000

1492
01:31:53,371 --> 01:31:58,340
bucks and he's gone.
She's gone on to make a plan.

1493
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:00,460
Take your.
Yeah.

1494
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,610
For the last 20 years.
Plans to.

1495
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:05,920
I guess you're right.
Redo the kitchen.

1496
01:32:05,921 --> 01:32:09,010
Could cost you anywhere.
I thought this was interesting.

1497
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:13,850
Just like a couple bucks.
That's a quick turnaround here.

1498
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:17,710
Why did you do that?
Because he's like a son to me.

1499
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:22,030
He was like,
Shit,

1500
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:24,833
you know,
it's almost like she wishes she didn't 

1501
01:32:27,911 --> 01:32:28,744
win because then she'd almost rather 
that they didn't win and then that they 

1502
01:32:33,521 --> 01:32:35,650
were still like friends.
Crazy.

1503
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:38,170
Like it's ruined her life.
What are they going to do?

1504
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,250
It's like you just won $600,000,
wouldn't you?

1505
01:32:40,251 --> 01:32:42,790
Going in and out spend half of it on 
attorneys.

1506
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:50,530
God,
he'll get over it on the winning ticket.

1507
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,393
They felt the phone number was mckinnis.
Britney's curly says when she called to 

1508
01:32:54,911 --> 01:32:57,400
notify the winters,
no one answered,

1509
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,670
so she called the shape or good.
It doesn't get better.

1510
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,380
You got all the good stuff.
I mean,

1511
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:07,220
I've got some other stuff here,
but we really blessed.

1512
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:10,600
We really spent a lot of time on the 
food.

1513
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:14,800
I don't have regrets.
Tell me if you want to watch any of this

1514
01:33:14,801 --> 01:33:16,600
stuff.
We can wrap it up.

1515
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:17,913
Squash some stuff.
But I've got Christian mom upset by 

1516
01:33:20,801 --> 01:33:22,870
north north.
Have you seen that by one,

1517
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:26,590
by one with 10.
That's an investment.

1518
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

1519
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:29,463
It's an audit because I.
It was kind of related to you writing 

1520
01:33:31,331 --> 01:33:35,140
your own hip hop song.
It shouldn't do it.

1521
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:37,770
I kind of want to say.
Okay,

1522
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:40,270
good.
Alright,

1523
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:45,420
so I'm going to put on the person.
Yeah.

1524
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:46,763
Oh the.

1525
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:49,610
It's a little long.
So bear with me.

1526
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:53,760
The song by Vince staples called North 
North on the radio.

1527
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,120
By the way,
that's a great song,

1528
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:59,490
but as far as hip hop songs go,
it's really not the worst one.

1529
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,560
Not even close,
man.

1530
01:34:01,650 --> 01:34:02,630
He's got a message,
right?

1531
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:03,473
So anyway,
she's having like a mental breakdown 

1532
01:34:06,091 --> 01:34:06,924
that it was playing on the radio and the
best she reads the whole lyrics to the 

1533
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:16,350
song with the best part is that because 
she literally reads every single lyric,

1534
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,333
they were able to mix it up.
So she's singing the song like he sat 

1535
01:34:20,941 --> 01:34:24,300
there for like 12 minutes reading and 
crying and having,

1536
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:27,600
yeah,
it's great

1537
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:33,650
bitch.
You don't die.

1538
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:38,370
I just want to dance with you baby.
Just don't move too fast,

1539
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:41,390
man.
Down shaded.

1540
01:34:42,170 --> 01:34:47,170
Take a Nigga mind on that and we 
function on my Yankee hat.

1541
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:55,980
Gangster gangster rap shit is 
everywhere.

1542
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,820
I didn't know the difference.
And Deanna Brown,

1543
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:00,730
like the dope daddy shooting in the 
kitchen,

1544
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:05,510
never went to Mali.
Hilson or Cabrillo of Trello.

1545
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:10,490
I don't even know if I pronounced that 
right below email.

1546
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,500
Then.
That was the first verse.

1547
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,110
This is the.
The main chorus says,

1548
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:20,780
I ain't never ran from nothing but the 
police.

1549
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:22,963
By the way,
I ain't never ran from nothing but the 

1550
01:35:24,951 --> 01:35:27,260
bullies.
Staples had the best response.

1551
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:30,740
I thought he was like,
he's like,

1552
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:33,920
he's like your reactions,
right?

1553
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:36,320
That's the point of the song.
It's a good day.

1554
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:38,780
You feel that way because it's so fucked
up.

1555
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:40,970
Like that's right.
You're getting the right reaction.

1556
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:42,080
That's okay.
Right?

1557
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:44,900
We wonder why this society is so messed 
up.

1558
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:46,010
Well,
listen to the music.

1559
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:48,950
Hit the corner.
I

1560
01:35:48,970 --> 01:35:51,480
don't need to watch all of this.
It's great.

1561
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,250
So no,
I can't believe I missed it.

1562
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:57,830
It's got a lot of Scada.
Love Lore surrounding it.

1563
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,290
Oh.
So her kids were in the background.

1564
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:07,670
Daughter was like put it on and it was 
like on the radio or something back.

1565
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:10,220
Actually the fact that the little babies
behind her,

1566
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:13,700
she's saying it word for word.
It's the same thing.

1567
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:18,190
It's actually a worse on the radio.
You don't really catch all the lyrics.

1568
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:20,480
She's like,
I can't believe my kids are hearing this

1569
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:23,660
on the radio and she's there dropping n 
bombs and all this bullshit.

1570
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:26,143
She's invasion new video.
Like people don't really get how it 

1571
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:31,380
works.
You know?

1572
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,400
All white people.
No don't really good like that.

1573
01:36:34,401 --> 01:36:35,234
It's like from a character still trying 
to figure out like everything is like 

1574
01:36:39,070 --> 01:36:39,903
literal,
like it says in the song I shot this 

1575
01:36:41,931 --> 01:36:43,730
guy,
they think he literally shot the dude,

1576
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:44,150
right?

1577
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:44,983
Yeah.
Like,

1578
01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:50,230
oh my God,
the police looking into this.

1579
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:54,540
Totally.
Um,

1580
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:56,540
so we've got to prank invasion,
new video,

1581
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:58,670
moaning addition.
Let's check it out.

1582
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:02,900
Pretty bad stuff.
There was a seizure edition as well.

1583
01:37:02,970 --> 01:37:07,190
She's pretty solid as you can imagine.
Theaters crazy.

1584
01:37:07,310 --> 01:37:07,880
Yeah.
He's,

1585
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:12,770
he's video since ours are his,
his invasion.

1586
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:14,241
Yeah,
he,

1587
01:37:14,241 --> 01:37:17,360
he's off the map pretty much.
I mean he's got kissing my fans,

1588
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:20,990
nurse addition couples edition,
whipped cream addition.

1589
01:37:20,991 --> 01:37:23,300
I think moaning addition.
You're gonna you're gonna.

1590
01:37:23,301 --> 01:37:24,134
Really enjoy this morning.
And how does it think about it by the 

1591
01:37:28,491 --> 01:37:29,040
way?
He's,

1592
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,830
he's,
he's kissing prank.

1593
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,600
He's been working out.
He's like,

1594
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:35,030
yeah,
a lot more veins.

1595
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:36,830
Yeah,
way more.

1596
01:37:36,831 --> 01:37:39,200
Raphael.
He's lived up.

1597
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:42,200
Huh?
But like he's more imposing now.

1598
01:37:42,201 --> 01:37:44,510
Like if you wanted to rape me or 
dominate me.

1599
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:46,363
You know what I'm saying?
Like if he like you're giving him that 

1600
01:37:48,561 --> 01:37:53,561
fucking kiss but the music never changes
somethings.

1601
01:37:57,650 --> 01:37:58,483
But you know what,
when I see these biceps kissing friends 

1602
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:05,220
gave me a really weird and creepy way 
and see what happens.

1603
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:06,143
As always,
let's do it as always like a really 

1604
01:38:09,061 --> 01:38:10,290
quick game of rock,
paper,

1605
01:38:10,291 --> 01:38:11,310
scissors.
If I win,

1606
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:13,050
I get to give you a really quick hands.
Okay.

1607
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:14,543
Alright,
here we go.

1608
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:20,520
Here you go guys.

1609
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,230
No,
at this point it's not just comedy.

1610
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:29,543
Why?
Just to see what happens then it just 

1611
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:39,023
stopped.
I don't think he's having like an 

1612
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,570
epileptic seizure.
Is that what it sounds?

1613
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:50,730
Alright Chris,
don't get my visit to monetize it.

1614
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:52,073
Fucking.
Is it the same noise each time or does 

1615
01:38:55,021 --> 01:38:56,540
he do differently?

1616
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:00,890
Quick Kiss.
Okay.

1617
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:01,883
Okay.
Here we go.

1618
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:03,443
Rock,
paper,

1619
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:05,070
scissors.
One more time.

1620
01:39:05,071 --> 01:39:05,904
Here we go.
Rock,

1621
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:06,803
paper,
scissors.

1622
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,490
I went,
come here.

1623
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:09,563
As always,

1624
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:31,030
I think he's.
He's really just trawling.

1625
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:34,350
Yeah,
he knows I'm not going to laugh.

1626
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:39,080
This is the part that we're me.
Is parodying himself.

1627
01:39:39,110 --> 01:39:40,940
Exactly.
We made that one

1628
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:41,831
video,
you know,

1629
01:39:41,831 --> 01:39:46,750
a,
a closer look at the line was getting so

1630
01:39:46,751 --> 01:39:47,584
blurred that I was actually starting to 
enjoy watching his videos because 

1631
01:39:49,691 --> 01:39:50,524
they're so like the morning one,
like it's your watch it and it's so 

1632
01:39:53,261 --> 01:39:55,680
stupid,
you know,

1633
01:39:57,390 --> 01:40:00,010
like there's a weird transformation 
going.

1634
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:04,690
I feel like if he keeps following the 
thread of so obscene,

1635
01:40:04,810 --> 01:40:08,950
so stupid that he could really be on to 
a new wave of entertainment

1636
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:09,993
that's always the hardest.
And somehow he went against all odds to 

1637
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:22,623
look back and make the girl in the same 
one probably that it's set up that you 

1638
01:40:31,001 --> 01:40:32,080
know,
just studied.

1639
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:36,200
It's just so repetitive.
Oh,

1640
01:40:36,201 --> 01:40:36,500
there's

1641
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,940
one here.
Let's watch this last one.

1642
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:38,970
It was fun.
I saw,

1643
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:40,490
I loved it.
Um,

1644
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:42,673
how to stop cyber bullying.
It's a big issue facing all of us today 

1645
01:40:44,901 --> 01:40:46,490
on the Internet.
As you guys know,

1646
01:40:46,491 --> 01:40:48,290
you work on their night live on the 
Internet.

1647
01:40:48,650 --> 01:40:51,680
Have you guys ever had promised 
cyberbullying all the time?

1648
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:52,730
Yeah.
Yeah,

1649
01:40:52,731 --> 01:40:54,880
me too.
They're bullying us all day.

1650
01:40:54,890 --> 01:40:55,890
Everyday.
Tough.

1651
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:59,140
It was on overwatch and some guy was 
yelling at me about something,

1652
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,190
right?
Oh,

1653
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:02,830
scared.
What do you do at that point?

1654
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:04,900
You've literally helpless.
I leave.

1655
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,960
I leave the house.
I have a hole in my backyard laying when

1656
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:12,840
it gets so well.
Anyway,

1657
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:16,290
we have a helpful tip for you on cyber 
bullying.

1658
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:26,960
I think the best advice I would keep 
through cyber bullying,

1659
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:30,623
but the way she phrases it almost sounds
like she's going to get tips to the 

1660
01:41:34,451 --> 01:41:35,284
cyber bullying.

1661
01:41:49,170 --> 01:41:51,190
Close your eyes.
I'm sorry.

1662
01:41:55,180 --> 01:42:00,180
I would get to sign her bullying.
Nailed it.

1663
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:14,160
That

1664
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:19,160
is great advice.
Yes.

1665
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,730
She's getting bullying now.
Ironically.

1666
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:25,083
I think we did it.
Let's go eat some dinner and go love 

1667
01:42:28,211 --> 01:42:31,690
your mom.
Everyone loves a good advice.

1668
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:34,990
So guys,
thank you for all tuning in and watching

1669
01:42:34,991 --> 01:42:38,500
and enjoy the show.
A Dow.

1670
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,140
Wow.
Hold it together for another minute.

1671
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:45,940
We're almost done.
Next month is looking pretty good.

1672
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:47,681
Yeah,
sure.

1673
01:42:47,681 --> 01:42:48,461
We.
Dan,

1674
01:42:48,461 --> 01:42:51,560
what do we got?
We've got jack sat down,

1675
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,590
Jack Septic Guy,
uh,

1676
01:42:53,591 --> 01:42:58,000
in a couple of weeks and then a dinner 
after that.

1677
01:42:58,420 --> 01:42:59,590
And then,
uh,

1678
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:01,023
this one's pretty big.
We've got Tim heidecker coming on the 

1679
01:43:03,641 --> 01:43:08,641
31st.
What am I hiding him?

1680
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:13,190
Really cool.
I had occur.

1681
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:14,183
Yep,
and then the week after that we got a 

1682
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:18,400
Adam Carolla,
so Adam Carolla also.

1683
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:20,170
Very cool.
Thank you.

1684
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:23,530
Um,
and possibly,

1685
01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:25,510
well I won't say it because it's not 
confirmed,

1686
01:43:25,511 --> 01:43:29,190
but hey,
we got a great lineup.

1687
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:30,460
Samples.
Yes.

1688
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:34,700
So next fight is probably just as 
alright,

1689
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:35,793
next.
Friday's just us having fun with the 

1690
01:43:38,141 --> 01:43:39,460
soundboards.
You guys are not gonna.

1691
01:43:39,461 --> 01:43:44,461
Want to miss it and would that be nice?
Thank you so much for watching.

1692
01:43:47,171 --> 01:43:52,171
I hope you have a great weekend.
Love your mother's guys.

1693
01:43:59,210 --> 01:44:01,730
Have a great weekend.
Take care of yourself.

1694
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:03,463
Happiness is number one.
You've got to do what's good for you in 

1695
01:44:05,061 --> 01:44:07,010
your life.
Be Mindful,

1696
01:44:07,011 --> 01:44:09,230
be aware of everything that you're 
appreciative,

1697
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:12,440
you know,
you know,

1698
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:14,870
constantly.
Don't take anything for granted.

1699
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:21,380
Like if I could all go away,
I mean seriously,

1700
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:27,530
you don't,
you don't want to lose sight of that.

1701
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:32,950
I think the audience will like if he 
goes,

1702
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:34,520
I ended.
Dan,

1703
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:38,330
save us from ourselves by everybody.
