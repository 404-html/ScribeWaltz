00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,520
Welcome everybody to the premiere 
experience and the podcasting world,

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,323
the age three podcast experience.
All other experiences are lesser to our 

3
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:22,690
own.
This is the premier experience.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,913
Today's episode is sponsored by stitch 
fix meant dimmable and empty empty 

5
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,010
movement.
I am Ethan Klein.

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,950
You're a grand wizard host of 
loneliness.

7
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:35,530
Last week I was the wizard of 
loneliness.

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,933
Isla was supposed to be back this week.
She had to delay her return by another 

9
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:41,883
10 days or so.
So I've taken on the title of grant 

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,260
wizard of Loneliness,
um,

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,460
not to do with the Klu Klux Klan,
by the way,

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,630
just my loneliness.
Uh,

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,880
I will talk more about Ella's extended 
trip.

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,893
It is quite a sad and unfortunate,
so I will save that for the end of the 

15
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,020
show.
Uh,

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,520
and I'm not going to lie to you guys.
I'm not wearing underwear today.

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,343
He has been gone for three weeks.
I've never been away from her for this 

18
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,370
long.
She's finally coming back on Wednesday.

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,810
Ila,
please come home.

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,980
I come almost completely.
I'm out of underwear.

21
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,210
I have no underwear,
dude.

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,373
I just came out of the bathroom.
There's pissed dribbling down my leg 

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,650
onto my pants.
You know what I'm talking about?

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,060
That's why you wear underwear,
right?

25
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:32,340
That's the whole point is that it 
catches your pis.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,650
I don't have that protection anymore.
Ila,

27
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,870
please,
I need you.

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,100
With that being said,
let's get right into it.

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,770
So,
uh,

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,910
I got a really exciting announcement.
Um,

31
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,540
announcing a new game we've got here.
Know your meme.

32
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,500
Um,
we're going to be taking calls today and

33
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:56,334
one very lucky color is going to chance 
to win a brand new slam and hot Samsung 

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,310
Galaxy s nine plus.
What's the value of that,

35
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:07,050
Dan?
It's like around a thousand dollars.

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,560
Now we personally,
my favorite phone on the market,

37
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:15,480
and if you can call in and guests three 
out of five answers about Joey Salads,

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,540
you're going to win a brand new phone.
Here's the number.

39
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,890
If you guys think you have what it takes
to know your meme with Joey Salads,

40
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:23,724
call (818) 214-8504.
We will be taking that one lucky color 

41
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,520
after the break.
Very,

42
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,950
very excited about that.
And true.

43
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,720
We want true salad heads.
By the way,

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,980
if you're not a true sal ahead,
we'll know and Ian will hang the f up on

45
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:42,990
you quick.
Okay,

46
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,400
so don't be wasting his time.
Okay.

47
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,800
Loving the sound board.
By the way,

48
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:54,801
this one is dedicated to you,
but before I,

49
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,520
I've got a lot I want to talk about 
today.

50
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,383
Okay.
Lucy to daddy o five and so many more 

51
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,224
goofs and gaffs along the way.
But I really like as we did last time I 

52
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,160
was in here,
the trenches by myself.

53
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,060
You start off with a great video video 
of the day.

54
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,610
Does that have a,
does that work?

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,150
I feel like it a better,
the better title.

56
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,120
I was thinking video of bliss.

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,970
It's a bit over the top,
isn't it?

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,770
Video of bliss.
I'm a think on it,

59
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,800
but I actually had two that I thought 
were so great.

60
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,860
I wanted to watch it at the top of you.
This one I got to tell you,

61
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,410
you're gonna,
you're gonna love this.

62
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,493
I can't,
I,

63
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,083
I'm such a skeptic.
I feel like part of me thinks this is 

64
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:43,484
fake,
but I have to believe in my soul and 

65
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,220
heart that it's real.
Um,

66
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,103
here we go.

67
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,680
Thank you.

68
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,910
This crawfish caught the fucking penny.
Oh,

69
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,800
show that again.
I was crazy.

70
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,030
I got to see that again.
Yeah.

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,400
Ethnic guys,
just like,

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,010
I mean,
how do you react when you throw a penny?

73
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:11,050
Had a crawfish and it catches it and its
claw.

74
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,490
How do you react?
That's pretty much the only way.

75
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,723
Okay.

76
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,190
But then the,
it begs the question,

77
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:22,370
why was he filming to begin with?
Right.

78
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

79
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,374
That's a good point.
Why are you filming a crawfish on a 

80
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:28,790
bathroom floor and then throwing a pen 
yet?

81
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,700
Like what,
in what world is this something that you

82
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:36,170
film that makes me suspicious yet again,
I've come full circle.

83
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,620
That being said,
I dunno.

84
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,440
I feel like it's real.
It fucking looks real.

85
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:51,170
But I,
but why are you,

86
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,080
why,
why we need,

87
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,580
we need a,
the captain.

88
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,110
We need the cabin back.
Yeah.

89
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:59,610
When the captain disillusion,
don't worry.

90
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,390
Okay.

91
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,800
But like,
why would someone filmed this?

92
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:03,340
I mean,
what,

93
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,300
Oh,
it's from instagram.

94
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:04,721
Yeah.
Everything.

95
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,120
There's fake.
Anyway,

96
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:07,954
I love it regardless.
And then there's one other one that I 

97
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:10,924
had to share with you guys.
This is one of my favorite videos to 

98
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:14,890
come from the Internet.
And these past weeks,

99
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,820
this guy went to city hall and gave an 
impassioned speech.

100
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:20,320
Not about,
you know,

101
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,190
traffic or politics or whatever city 
ordiance taxables shit you would here at

102
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,280
city council.
No,

103
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,510
this man came with something much more 
important and pressing.

104
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,810
He came asking that massage therapists 
be able to jerk you off.

105
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,500
Sometimes you got to go with you.
Sometimes you have to go to city hall to

106
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,334
get to fight for your rights.
Why can't a massage therapist touch my 

107
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:58,220
dick if I pay an extra 20 bucks?
20 bucks is that,

108
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,870
that's probably a good deal.
It's probably more than that.

109
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,133
Anyway,
here.

110
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,520
Yeah.
Anyway,

111
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,710
this guy obviously says it better than I
ever could.

112
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:08,990
So with that,
yeah,

113
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,300
here you go.
It seems quiet,

114
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,143
Dan.

115
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,270
Let's go here.
We let things go.

116
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,800
It's a little different than are you?
Why is it different,

117
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:39,970
Dan?
Uh,

118
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
you know what?
You're right.

119
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,040
Why is it different?
Hell we let ask doctors,

120
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,660
finger men basically finger men all day.
Not Basically,

121
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,240
literally,
literally finger means assholes all day.

122
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,350
This guy's a hero,
dude,

123
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,053
don't question him.

124
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,403
Rolling.

125
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,633
I love the his,
the crotch of his argument is what's 

126
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:23,730
worse.
I got to go back.

127
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:25,080
Is that really what he argued?
He's like,

128
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,500
it's more nasty for the practicality,
so let just let him jerk him off.

129
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,413
Right?

130
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,453
He's saying,
what's the difference you're already 

131
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:37,434
getting in the folds.
Why not just touch his dick along the 

132
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,650
way?
Compelling argument.

133
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,110
I'd like to see a counterpoint made to 
that.

134
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,170
Right,
right.

135
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,093
Amen,
brother.

136
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,690
What a Patriot and go get one,
right?

137
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,060
Wow.
Wow.

138
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,510
Okay.
Not a full circle right there.

139
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,190
Amen,
brother.

140
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,740
That guy's definitely a comedian,
right?

141
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,390
He's got the socks and sandals.

142
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,340
That would truly be a happy ending for 
everyone.

143
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,260
Fuck

144
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,610
Amen,
brother Dan,

145
00:08:35,611 --> 00:08:38,430
if you are,
have you ever had gotten a massage,

146
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:41,400
like a,
like a full body Swedish massage?

147
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:42,390
Dan?
I have not.

148
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,340
Seriously.
Yeah,

149
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,910
never done it.
I was going to ask if like I've gotten a

150
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:50,370
couple of times,
but I just fucking applause.

151
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,263
Sound effect.
I was going to ask if it's ever moved 

152
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:55,620
when you were getting a massage?
Uh,

153
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:57,240
I mean,
I can't say in a professional setting.

154
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,380
I mean,
you know,

155
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,570
obviously in private that's a different,
that's a different tale altogether.

156
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,150
But no,
it's,

157
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,140
it's too weird.
I don't know.

158
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,270
I have like,
I have a weird hang ups about it.

159
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,550
Sometimes it moves.
Sure.

160
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,810
I mean it's a natural,
what are you going to do?

161
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,420
Can you do anyway?
God bless to this guy,

162
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,430
Ian,
has it ever moved for you?

163
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:22,740
Have you ever had a massage and he's off
headset right now.

164
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:24,810
He's starting to screen calls.
All right,

165
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,630
let's just say that he has no,
okay.

166
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,043
Um,

167
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,553
yeah,

168
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,763
so anyway,
I salute this Patriot and I'm all about 

169
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,720
it.
All right.

170
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:37,710
But that being said,
let's get,

171
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:41,490
let's get into the main event here.
Boosie too.

172
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,363
I feel like it's like a repeat almost of
last week when we talked about Connie 

173
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,640
cannacon just trying to decode and 
explain what's happening.

174
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,560
So Fusi,
Fusi,

175
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,060
tube,
if you guys don't know who he is,

176
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,420
he's a,
he,

177
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,420
he can has a prankster and he faked a 
lot of pranks.

178
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:03,150
He almost,
he invented almost like the moral,

179
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,810
the righteous fake prank where it was 
like,

180
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,410
uh,
what,

181
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,890
what was the example you gave me Dan,
where he had one word.

182
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,753
Oh yeah.
He's like,

183
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,483
he sends in the street and he's yelling 
at people for not having like they're a 

184
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,100
seat belt on or something.
I don't know.

185
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:22,530
Just like he's always got to have like a
moral twist on it.

186
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:24,930
He kind of invented that whole thing.
So anyway,

187
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,880
he fell off.
I'm pretty sure he's,

188
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:27,714
he's been having a lot of mental issues 
and it seems like he's in a full blown 

189
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:32,100
manic state right now.
I mean,

190
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,350
he,
let's start here.

191
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:39,351
Let's start from the top here.
He says with 2 million viewers,

192
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,760
drake is going to grace the stage of my 
concert.

193
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,100
He's only got 2000 likes.
That seems like a far way off.

194
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,050
2 million views.
Um,

195
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,330
anyway,
he keeps saying that Drake's going to be

196
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:55,560
at a show.
Drake's going to be at a show.

197
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,090
He's never,
he never talked to drake.

198
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:58,470
He's ever known drake.
He's,

199
00:10:58,471 --> 00:10:59,304
he sells out the Greek a free show and 
he says Drake's going to be there and 

200
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:04,974
obviously drink never shows up.
But basically what ensues is a lot of 

201
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,234
insanity,
a lot of confusion and a very little 

202
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:13,320
crowd.
Um,

203
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,340
and him stalking drake,
which is probably the best,

204
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,453
I mean the best,
the most entertaining and concerning 

205
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:26,210
thing to come out of this whole thing.
Um,

206
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,770
this video pretty much sums it all up 
for me.

207
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,580
Let me throw this up here for you.
This,

208
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,750
this video really has it all.
It's got stocking.

209
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,370
It's got a Jeroma.

210
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,260
Let's hear it quiet.

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,990
Dan,
can you turn it up?

212
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,973
Yep.
Gotcha.

213
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,710
Do to the people.

214
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,530
And by the way,
he's taken this clip from someone else's

215
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,364
show and upload.
This is a video on his channel right 

216
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:19,430
now.
So to put it in frame here

217
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,283
building,

218
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,033
this is when it gets really good.
So I think he probably spent about a 

219
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,010
hundred thousand dollars reserving the 
Greek.

220
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,653
And I will say to his credit,
I mean I don't want to compare it to 

221
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:47,174
Taneka cause with Tana did was basically
sell supposedly free tickets and didn't 

222
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:56,240
even give on the event or refund people 
his was free.

223
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,463
So at least there's,
there's the a big separation to be made 

224
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:00,741
there.
I mean,

225
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:04,010
he's not scamming people,
he's just misleading people,

226
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,710
but it's a free show.
But what's really fascinating,

227
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:11,711
it's just his clear mental decline here.
Um,

228
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,413
watch this.

229
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,960
I want to go over a little bit on that 
as hard.

230
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,803
Right.

231
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,470
Is He,
is he,

232
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,980
I mean I can't tell if he's just like 
cracked out.

233
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,840
Yeah.
Our features on a manic rant.

234
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:39,730
Yeah,
it,

235
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,563
it,
it,

236
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,310
it seems very manic.
Yeah.

237
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,120
It seems very mannequin and isn't he?
He publicly has a history of that.

238
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:47,710
Does he not he,
he has.

239
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,700
Yeah.
He's bipolar,

240
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:49,580
he said.
Right.

241
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,630
So I just,
yeah,

242
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,000
I dunno.
I think people give food seat.

243
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,331
Well,
let,

244
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:55,510
let's,
let's keep watching.

245
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:57,490
Let's get the whole frame of reference 
here.

246
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,323
Oh

247
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,653
whoa.

248
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,650
I love that he included that.
I Dunno who it was.

249
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,513
I don't even know if it was a police 
officer could have just been normal guy 

250
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,150
who's just like,
fuck this idiot,

251
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,553
give back of your car.
He goes from being like a total bad ass 

252
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:41,620
to being like,
oh,

253
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,930
I'm sorry dude.
Sorry about that.

254
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,360
But he leaves it in,
which I find curious.

255
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,890
You clearly could have edited that out.
He finished his statement,

256
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,100
but he got an I,
and I hate to say this,

257
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:57,460
but he got cooked a little bit by 
whoever was on the street.

258
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,160
You know what I mean?
When he left that in,

259
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,590
find the interesting,
um,

260
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,170
now this is when it get texts are really
dark twist.

261
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,041
I mean,
first of all,

262
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,860
dude,
if there's a setting for any video,

263
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,310
okay,

264
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,320
talking to a celebrity,
this is him.

265
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,663
I mean,
look at,

266
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,170
look at this frame.
He's,

267
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,981
I mean,
dude,

268
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,780
this is straight out of like a horror 
movie.

269
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,960
Like are you in my basement right now?
Fusi?

270
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,470
I listen what he says.
He's got the dongles hanging out.

271
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,410
Okay.

272
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,420
Those downloads are not a good look for 
anybody,

273
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:33,140
by the way,
let alone a celebrity stalker.

274
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:38,141
But let's watch.
Cool.

275
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:41,954
You've acknowledged stopped there.
I literally look and I'm acting like a 

276
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,500
crazy person right now because I'm 
outside of the house.

277
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:50,450
You're at stop there dude.
You just,

278
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,430
you just summarized it.

279
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,850
Okay.

280
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,270
But he knows that it's not actually 
crazy even though it is.

281
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,560
All right.
Don't ask me how I found it.

282
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,390
I've got ways,
creepy,

283
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:09,570
creepy ways.
You're probably wondering how did I find

284
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:10,404
you?
You're probably wondering to yourself 

285
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,620
rent now,
how did I find you and do I need to call

286
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:20,780
the police and get a restraining order?
Do I need to have my body gourds,

287
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,230
body guards,
escort and mount?

288
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,270
You're probably wondering,
don't worry about that.

289
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,023
Don't worry.
I I,

290
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,210
it's interesting how we on one hand 
acknowledges all this,

291
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,760
how creepy he's been.
Right?

292
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,180
And on the other hand,
fully committed.

293
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:38,290
It's why it seems so manic is it doesn't
seem,

294
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,230
yeah.
Does it seem like he's intoxicated or on

295
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:43,240
drugs or anything?
He's very clear headed about it.

296
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:44,890
It's just nuts.
Well,

297
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,180
symptoms of of Manic episode,
I mean here,

298
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,990
let's read it off.
Abnormally upbeat,

299
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,810
jumpy or wired bill.
Increased activity,

300
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:57,310
energy or agitation.
Boom.

301
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,570
Exaggerated self sense of wellbeing and 
self confidence.

302
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,740
Yes.
Unusually talkative racing thoughts.

303
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,360
Distractability I mean,

304
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,670
yeah,
Yup,

305
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,993
Yup.

306
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,470
I started the line I never thought of.
That is one old person.

307
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,043
It's an extra little layer of creepy 
that he keeps playing that God's plan 

308
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:31,830
loop.
This is like such a creepy stalker video

309
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,900
of like a weird fan food.
If fusi ends up killing track,

310
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:42,450
I'll be like 10% surprised God's plan.
Baby.

311
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,970
You might be thinking to yourself,
he's like over him.

312
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,550
Drink sleeping in his,
he's like covering over him.

313
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,610
You might think this is a little strange
streak.

314
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,620
Okay,

315
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,140
but this is God's plan for me to murder 
you right now.

316
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,150
In fact,
if you look down,

317
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:02,070
you'll notice is already a knife in your
stomach.

318
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,090
I mean,
you know what he does.

319
00:18:05,091 --> 00:18:06,380
Meanwhile,
he's got on his phone,

320
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:11,381
God's plan looping God's plan.
God's plan.

321
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,920
Damn.
Damn he is [inaudible].

322
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:20,720
He's going to come down to earth and cut
and like,

323
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,000
I dunno,
I dunno how long manic episodes last,

324
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,080
but he's going to be like,
Oh,

325
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,591
I dunno.
Fusi.

326
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:28,280
He's interesting guy.
Like,

327
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,973
I don't know if I feel bad for him in a 
way because it's like he's such a 

328
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,570
strange situation with him because he 
has a fan base.

329
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,290
Like when you're,
when you're having a manic episode,

330
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:47,530
I'd having delusions of grandeur,
the fact that he actually has a fan base

331
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:50,360
and people encouraging him.
Right.

332
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,330
That makes it all so much more fucked 
up.

333
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:56,360
So much worse.
He's just enables his delusions.

334
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,980
Yeah,
it's crazy.

335
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,553
Okay.

336
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,950
Can you imagine how to see having a 32nd
conversation that's never happened.

337
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,050
I promise that this event is going to be
huge,

338
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,330
but I need you for it to be huge.
It's like,

339
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,164
yeah,
fucking obviously he doesn't need you 

340
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,010
though.
Unfortunately.

341
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,410
When it goes one way,
I'm like,

342
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,910
I'm like,
listen guys,

343
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,160
I'm putting on the hugest show of the 
year.

344
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,303
All I need is Tupac and Biggie to return
from the grave and cohosted with me and 

345
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,060
it's going to be the biggest concert 
ever put on

346
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,530
sick,
sick hype,

347
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:54,364
Bro.
How long did it take you to make that 

348
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:58,400
and premiere?
Oh,

349
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,980
oh hey.
Now my video can get copyrighted.

350
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,830
Dang.
You just fucked me up.

351
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,600
Thanks for the thanks to see your 
fucking,

352
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:11,200
all of our monetization it up now.
Now I got beef with you.

353
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,710
Um,
where's my mouse?

354
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,090
So he uploaded on this channel.
I mean it's still up of him.

355
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:20,220
Literally.
Here's a,

356
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,180
this always trips me out when I can see 
myself.

357
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,650
Um,
it's still up of him publicly stocking a

358
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,684
celebrity on his channel,
which just shows you how unaware he use 

359
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,570
of,
of how strange is his behaviors.

360
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,300
Um,
so that's,

361
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,310
that's where,
that's kind of where it began.

362
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,120
He's no withdrawn from,
from the Internet,

363
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:44,170
right?
I Dunno.

364
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,990
He's retreated back into,
into his cave.

365
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,123
Yeah.
I don't know.

366
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,750
He is,
he,

367
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,550
he posted a distract on rice gum,
which I find strange,

368
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:55,384
like out of,

369
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,400
okay.

370
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,680
Clearly acting's not working out for 
your dog.

371
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:06,681
That was a pretty corny read a clear,
clearly acting,

372
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,420
uh,
not working out for me.

373
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,123
I feel like I just acted that out better
than him when I was trying to act that 

374
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,360
can I?

375
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,653
Okay.

376
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,620
Damn.
That was really counted on the phone.

377
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:26,454
Wow.
Crazy.

378
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,530
Crazy.
So anyway,

379
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:31,530
it's just,
it's really just another youtube hip hop

380
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:32,364
did it.
You got to seen a thousand of these rap 

381
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:34,524
video.
But what I found fascinating about this 

382
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,740
was the vision board.
I'm here,

383
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,370
let me play for a second just so you can
kind of

384
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,280
put into perspective what he hoped for 
this song.

385
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,680
So rice,
gum distract.

386
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,150
So anyway,
you get that.

387
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:56,590
Yeah,
I mean you really get the idea.

388
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:57,424
That's all I need to see.
So his vision for this rice come 

389
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,963
distract is number one song on billboard
hot 100 can you imagine the country 

390
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:08,080
banking tour,
race gum,

391
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Distrac the region of 50 million views 
and under three months.

392
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,503
Well,
in what fucking planet to rice come 

393
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:19,134
distract bro.
Like if you want it to actually make an 

394
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,124
accessible song,
why would you just write it about 

395
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,410
anything else?
Club banger on radio in the entire world

396
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:37,110
at least once a day.
Manifest your dreams.

397
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:38,850
Just as I did,
man.

398
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,870
I swear to God,
I'm,

399
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,870
I feel like I'm entering the mind of men
reading this.

400
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,270
Help each other,
achieve each other's dream.

401
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:46,490
Kill your ego.
Oof.

402
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,850
You got a long way to go there,
buddy.

403
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,333
Okay,

404
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,220
so I don't know.
I thought that was pretty cute.

405
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:54,570
Pretty cute.
Pretty interesting.

406
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,990
Well guys,
I mean we can get it there.

407
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,280
We got to get this on top.
Billboard number one.

408
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:05,850
I'm sure it's really close.
It's climbing.

409
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,280
It's climbing first.
God,

410
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:12,150
I really need the yellow pack.
I need Isla back,

411
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:13,920
dude.
Next week.

412
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,600
Next week.
Thanks a week.

413
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:18,330
Maybe Wednesday.
No fucking underwear.

414
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,670
I always joke about people getting shit 
stains.

415
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,810
I was like,
who gets shit stands?

416
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,510
I'm in pants was shit and piss inside of
it.

417
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,470
I'll show you if you don't believe me.
There's little shit streaks.

418
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,890
I've got SMEGMA building up on my penis.
I didn't have for skin.

419
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,710
Eva changes my diaper and cleans my 
Dick.

420
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,290
Telling you Ila,
please come back.

421
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,640
Ah,
where was I event?

422
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,690
Yada,
Yada Yada.

423
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,560
He holds the event at the Greek.
A free show.

424
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,420
How many seats is a Greek cab?
Like 10,000

425
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,033
new.
Quite.

426
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,150
What does this video training,
whatever Greek holds?

427
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:01,700
Uh,
I believe around six or 7,000.

428
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,740
Okay.
Pretty big show.

429
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,800
So this,
this is my favorite thing to cut.

430
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:08,300
So this is the show.
It's happening.

431
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,850
Fusi hasn't even showed up,
but this,

432
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,560
this is the fucking crowd.
I mean,

433
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:17,330
what does that like 20 people there at 
the stage and this Dj man,

434
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,500
God bless his soul.

435
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,603
Crushing it.
Huh?

436
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,940
Look at the employees.
They're like,

437
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:26,774
what is this like these guys?
Are you still like ushering like huge 

438
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:33,290
solo out events?
What the fuck is this?

439
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,520
I swear to God,
you must,

440
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,870
I mean,
getting the Greek,

441
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,400
we were going to spend 25,000
just to rent out the ace,

442
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,800
which is a 2000 seat theater.
That was 25,000

443
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,963
this on all this shit.
I'd say at least a hundred thousand he 

444
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:52,180
spent on this.
Yeah.

445
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,590
And I mean the Greek is,
it's an iconic venue.

446
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,750
It's very,
very much in demand.

447
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,970
Yeah.
It's not cheap.

448
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,540
Wow.
On a weekend too.

449
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,730
Oh yeah.
On a weekend.

450
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,920
Damn.
Yeah,

451
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:09,420
that's,
that's a pretty penny right there.

452
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,440
It's trying to hype up the crowd.

453
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,041
Well,
I don't know,

454
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,660
man.
You're mixing doesn't sound that good.

455
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,720
I love that.
Even the Djs in on this illusion,

456
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,050
delusion.
What if drake just walked on stage right

457
00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:27,810
now to the hundred of you huddled around
the stage,

458
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:37,170
he'd be so mad.
No Dude,

459
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,900
it's because you and not drink.
Killing it.

460
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,820
Crushing it.
Damn.

461
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,890
That's a,
that is a coal to crowd my dudes.

462
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,993
Yeah.

463
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,970
Jesus Christ.
That's the vibe there.

464
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,190
There's basically nobody there.
Um,

465
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,860
and then someone calls it cause it's,
he's livestreaming it.

466
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,210
It's got like 60,000
views.

467
00:26:10,211 --> 00:26:12,670
He said he was going to get 2 million.
Jake was going to come out.

468
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,950
There's like a thousand people there,
60,000

469
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:17,350
people watching online.
That's kind of a lot to be honest.

470
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:18,184
But I think most people are watching 
just for the beautiful train wreck that 

471
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,600
they knew what was going to be and 
somebody called a bomb threat,

472
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,200
which is just like Jerry on top.
I mean it's like I'm not surprised.

473
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:37,740
I'm not surprised.
There are conspiracy theories and I have

474
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:41,790
to say they're compelling cause you 
always have to ask yourself who benefits

475
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:42,624
the most from this crime bomb threats 
called could totally be anyone on the 

476
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:48,570
Internet.
I mean that is a,

477
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,100
it's a juicy mean,

478
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,500
but if Fusi called the bomb threat,
he wasn't at the venue yet.

479
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,980
He was waiting to see how big it got.
If drake would just,

480
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,503
I don't know what he thinks happened.
If like drake would just like 

481
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:05,980
materialize.
He's like 2 million,

482
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,850
I'm here.
But if he called it in himself,

483
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:12,460
I wonder if he was able to get a refund 
to be like,

484
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,560
Oh man,
the show never happened or oh,

485
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:16,540
I don't have to be embarrassed because 
drake never showed up.

486
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,553
You know what I'm saying?
He kind of benefited the most from that 

487
00:27:20,531 --> 00:27:21,364
bomb threat,
which is why it's a compelling 

488
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,040
conspiracy theory.
And I'm not saying that.

489
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,963
How dare you say,
I would never say or implicate or say 

490
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,830
and make any statement like that as an 
opinion.

491
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,373
You know what I'm saying?
There is a thought experiment merely 

492
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:44,620
asking questions.
Been through enough lawsuits

493
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,250
won by the way.
And that's plenty.

494
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:52,150
That's plenty there.
There is some sense in it,

495
00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:53,800
you know?
I mean he benefit,

496
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:55,090
he really,
he did.

497
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,980
Frankly,
I can see him benefiting from that bond.

498
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,920
But like you said,
I mean,

499
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,930
you know,
people get swatted all the time.

500
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,500
Deal.
Really.

501
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,620
It could be somebody else just,
just as silly.

502
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,280
Yup.
Easily.

503
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,160
Whoever it was,
by the way,

504
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:11,020
fuck that person.
And I hope they get caught.

505
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:16,000
If it does end up being food soup,
wouldn't that be like the greatest twice

506
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:19,840
in this epic saga ever?
Am I explaining this?

507
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,570
If people understanding,
is this making sense?

508
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,670
Who gives a fuck?
It's also stupid.

509
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,833
There's just another thing of like 
youtube has just devolved into such 

510
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,900
like,
why is he famous?

511
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:36,490
You know what I mean?
Like Youtube is,

512
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,463
youtube has turned into this like engine
for creating fame for people who should 

513
00:28:42,161 --> 00:28:45,280
never had even a taste of fame.

514
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,190
Okay.

515
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,580
The most Fusi should have ever been 
famous for his stocking drake.

516
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,300
Yeah,

517
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,740
like there's so many people and when you
give fame and like cause fame,

518
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,633
it has,
it has a lot of power and frankly a lot 

519
00:29:00,471 --> 00:29:01,304
of responsibility that comes with it.
And when you give it to somebody like 

520
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:04,904
that and many others on youtube,
it's like you're given a bazooka to a 

521
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:13,541
monkey.
Fusi should not be famous man.

522
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:15,990
Okay,

523
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,180
so many other people.
The cons,

524
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:20,550
Tana should not be famous.
My God,

525
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,050
Tana should be working at Wendy's 
specifically.

526
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:25,884
Wendy,
she does the other fast foods for some 

527
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:32,130
reason don't ring true to me.
She should be serving up Wendy's.

528
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:33,790
Okay,

529
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:38,250
and yet here she is,
you know?

530
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,610
Well she might be serving on burgers in 
prison.

531
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:49,611
Pretty soon somebody's got to cook them.
You think they get burgers and prison?

532
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,530
Maybe?
I think they probably do.

533
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,250
That was pretty dope.
Prison doesn't sound that bad after all.

534
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,350
Sounds Nice.
I don't know.

535
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,970
This is why I'm like,
I feel like I don't,

536
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,240
I don't like,
I love the podcast because I really feel

537
00:30:03,241 --> 00:30:04,074
like we're doing our own thing,
but I just feel like you tuber is 

538
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:09,390
becoming and youtube itself is just 
like,

539
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,880
what is this?
It's like always the same shit.

540
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:16,881
Like this is fucking stupid.
I might have been talking about this.

541
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:23,750
I got to finish this story though.
It's reality show,

542
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,630
you know it's the same I guess.
Right?

543
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,050
But it's almost,
I mean maybe it's not worse.

544
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:31,340
I don't know.
I guess you're right.

545
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,390
It is the same impulse,
but people look at Kim Kardashian.

546
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,730
I mean I guess a lot of people look to 
them as a role model.

547
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,380
I guess it's the same kind of thing.
I don't know.

548
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,723
Not that I know.
So then basically the bomb threat shuts 

549
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:48,650
this whole bitch down and he shows up,
gets on his,

550
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,780
gets on a car or the uber driver who was
fired by the way after this.

551
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,260
So good.
He's like,

552
00:30:57,261 --> 00:30:58,550
I'll give you,
he said,

553
00:30:58,551 --> 00:30:59,384
this isn't the video,
but I'm not going to bother showing it 

554
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:02,300
too cause it's like,
come on,

555
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,100
give me a fucking break.
But he says,

556
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,083
I'll give you $50,000
if you let me stand on your car and 

557
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:11,870
deliver a monologue to everybody.
And he's like,

558
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,190
okay.
You know,

559
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,380
so it goes on the car,
he makes them hit a blunt,

560
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,690
he gets fired obviously.
And then food,

561
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:22,430
see sharing their text messages of the 
Uber drive being like,

562
00:31:22,431 --> 00:31:23,360
dude,
I got fired.

563
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:25,040
I really need this job.
I need the money.

564
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,630
And he's like,
talk to my accountant.

565
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,660
My accountant's going to hook you up.
Whatever.

566
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,790
I can't tell if that's flab or six back.

567
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,270
He's got a rolled up though.
Why does he have it rolled up?

568
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,493
What does,
and you're already wearing a wife 

569
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:40,594
beater.
It's the most breathable shirt you can 

570
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:43,510
possibly wear.
So it's like,

571
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,700
it makes it look like he's wearing a 
sports bra.

572
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,460
Does it got some nice teddy's but like 
some support,

573
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,290
right?
I can't tell what's flab or arts muscle,

574
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:58,291
but he's rolled up.
Just take it off.

575
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,530
I mean take off the fucking shirt.
At that point you're,

576
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,733
you've gone 70% of the way training bra.
You've got a training bra and for some 

577
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:09,800
luscious breasts you've been grilling.
Um,

578
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,240
it sounds weird to say a training bra 
and luscious breasts.

579
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,630
Yeah.

580
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,070
Next to each other.
You know what I mean?

581
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,920
Was like 10 years apart.

582
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,553
Okay,

583
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,913
let's move on.

584
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,753
I love that line.

585
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:38,830
It's really not a great insult.
Heating up my,

586
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,000
you're heating up your breakfast.
Well anyway,

587
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:41,910
let's watch this shit.
Um,

588
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,853
you know,
don't want to drag this out too much by 

589
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:53,580
the way.
His event is called like a hate dies.

590
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:56,080
Love wins or whatever.
Rise arrived.

591
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,940
He just gets on this car and he's 
fucking talking shit to everybody.

592
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,090
Fuck you.
Well,

593
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,953
to be fair,
there's a lot of love sprinkled in 

594
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,380
there,
seemingly at random to you.

595
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,740
Little Love,
a little hate.

596
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,870
No.
He should call his vent a little love.

597
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:13,704
A little,
hey,

598
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,323
that would have been accurate.
I would have accepted that is a more 

599
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:18,820
accurate,
I'm going to throw a convention called a

600
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:19,830
little love.
A little,

601
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,410
hey,
it's a balanced meal.

602
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,510
Anyway,

603
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,610
this,
this is an image of a man on the,

604
00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:33,750
on the verge of a complete,
you know,

605
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,840
this reminds me of,
you remember the coney guy?

606
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,210
Oh,
the county guy.

607
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:40,700
He came the biggest meme on the 
Internet,

608
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,563
right?
And then he was jerking off at the 

609
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:43,544
corner some corner in San Diego.
He was like the most important guy and 

610
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,300
then he was jerking off and public Fusi 
as a couple,

611
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,870
as a couple stressful days away from 
full blown masturbating in public.

612
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,893
I mean,
I wouldn't be at all surprised if he 

613
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,840
whipped out his dick right now on that 
car.

614
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,310
He's just sharing the love now.
That's what I call love arriving.

615
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,100
Give me three seconds by loves about to 
arrive,

616
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:15,170
baby.
Anyway,

617
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,960
you get the fucking idea.
It gives a shit.

618
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,220
Yeah.
Uh,

619
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,630
anyway,
I really,

620
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:26,990
for me,
ah,

621
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,630
he's,
he's having a mental break.

622
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,190
There's really no question about it.
Definitely he's,

623
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,910
he,
he is bipolar and he said that.

624
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:37,940
So the do needs help.
He needs intervention man.

625
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:42,941
He needs someone who loves him and cares
about him to step in and be like,

626
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:46,730
dude,
let's wrap this up before you'd get your

627
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:50,720
dick out in public because there's no 
going back once you go that far.

628
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,800
Absolutely.
Yeah.

629
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,643
The top of this week when we heard about
all of this and then I started 

630
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:58,400
investigating it,
I was laughing my ass off.

631
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:03,160
I thought it was hilarious and the more 
I watched the laughter was fading,

632
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:03,771
I was like,
oh,

633
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:05,660
this is,
this is actually kind of sad.

634
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,070
This,
this event is called the,

635
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,730
the laughter dies and the concern 
around,

636
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,550
yeah.
All right,

637
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:14,420
let's take a quick break.

638
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,253
We got,
we're going to come back with know your 

639
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:19,670
meme featuring Joey Salads.
I am so excited to play this game.

640
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:20,504
We've got to all prepared.
Joey himself has a recorded answers so 

641
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,980
you are not going to want to miss this 
guys.

642
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,060
See you soon.
It's hard enough to dress myself.

643
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,900
Let's be honest,
especially with egon,

644
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,850
it's impossible.
Talk about going to a store,

645
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,530
buying stuff,
making decisions.

646
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,060
It's,
it's unfathomable.

647
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,230
That's why stitch fix is changing the 
game.

648
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,400
So convenient.
Stitch fix is an online site.

649
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,770
You Go,
you tell them your style,

650
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,990
your preferences,
your budget,

651
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,183
and they have a stylist that we'll pick 
out clothing for you based on your 

652
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:02,960
preferences and send it to you,
tailored for you.

653
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,450
You don't have to go to the store.
You don't have to pick anything out.

654
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:10,710
You don't have to worry about it.
You got people with taste to do that for

655
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:10,840
you.

656
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,230
And let's be frank.
Most of us,

657
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,190
most of us guys,
we can't dress ourselves.

658
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,623
We are completely helpless.
I'm gonna be frank with you guys right 

659
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:20,934
now.
I am not wearing underwear because isla 

660
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:25,170
has been gone for three weeks and I 
haven't done laundry.

661
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,340
I'm just saying,
not all of us have egos and for the rest

662
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:32,640
of us that stitch fix,
they've reinvented how we buy clothes.

663
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:34,740
You just answer a few questions on size,
preference,

664
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:36,060
budget,
boom.

665
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:36,894
You're going silas springs into action

667
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:46,770
which is applied as a credit towards 
anything you keep.

668
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,860
And since it is based on your 
preference,

669
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,350
it,
you're still in control.

670
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,200
It's not your mom taking over here.
Okay,

671
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,720
why don't your items arrive?
You try them on.

672
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,180
And here's the best part.
You only pay for what you keep.

673
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,390
So really they're sending you clothes to
try on and if you like it,

674
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:05,040

Stitch fix.

686
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,550
Very excited about our new sponsor meant
mobile,

687
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,690
which is changing the game on cellular 
phone plans.

688
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,100
Now,
let me give you a little anecdote.

689
00:37:57,101 --> 00:38:00,940
When I was in Israel and me and either 
were really broke,

690
00:38:00,941 --> 00:38:01,774
barely getting by,
there was companies who was doing like 

691
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:04,234
these guys did and it's saved our ass.
What these guys offer is basically an 

692
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:11,530
exit from these normal giants like at t 
and t and verizon and everyone else,

693
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:12,364
because these guys will cut your 
wireless bill down to 15 bucks a month 

694
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,660
instead of and sort of what,
50 to a hundred bucks.

695
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:22,180
I mean mobile,
it's so fricking expensive.

696
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,930
It should be $15 a month and these guys 
are going to get you there.

697
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,003
Meant mobile is proving to millions of 
Americans that getting your wireless 

698
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:31,090
bill doesn't have to be the worst day of
the month.

699
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,223
They make it so easy to cut the wireless
bill down to just 15 use your own phone 

700
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,990
with any meant mobile plant.

701
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,823
You can keep your old number along with 
all of your existing contracts and you 

702
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:46,390
choose between two five or 10 gigabyte,
four g lte plants.

703
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,523
There's no,
you don't have to pay for an unlimited 

704
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,130
data plan that you're never going to 
use.

705
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,653
Every plant comes with unlimited talk 
and text so you can safely and cheaply 

706
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,763
annoy all your friends and loved ones.
I hope my mom doesn't get this plan and 

707

three and the empty movement watches are
the greatest watches on the market and 

721
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:57,910
the cheapest price.
How do they do that?

722
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,700
They cut out the middle man and do it 
themselves.

723
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:05,140
Don't take my word for it.
Take it from the almost 2 million people

724
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,153
that have bought watches and 160 
countries and they continue to 

725
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:13,840
revolutionize the market.
Check this out.

726
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:18,040
They come from being crowdfunded kids 
working out of a living room.

727
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,023
The past year.
They not only introduced a ton of new 

728
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:21,604
watch collections for both men and women
and also expanded into sunglasses and 

729
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:27,160
fashion forward bracelets for her.

730
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,340
Uh,
they keep making new new products.

731
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:31,720
They'll get.
This is their new one right here.

732
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,690
This is the revolver.
Uh,

733
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,870
I gotta tell you I like it.
I want,

734
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:38,704
I want one of these.
Look at this black one dude's slick as 

735
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,064
hell.
It's like,

736
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,620
what the fuck is up now?
Haters.

737
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,330
That's what I would,
that's what it says to me.

738
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,760
And this is what I frankly like this.
Okay?

739
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,750
It's a watch.
It tells the time and it looks good.

740
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:57,070
It's not blowing up my wrist.
Isla always sending me nudes.

741
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,830
Gimme a break.
You know what I mean?

742
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,530
It's a watch.
That's what it does.

743
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:07,270
It looks good.
So movement watches start at just $95 at

744
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:11,620
a department store.
You're looking at four to 500 to 5,000

745
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,400
a million dollars in department stores.
But these guys,

746
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,323
95 bucks,
a classic design quality construction 

747
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,400
styled minimalist.
Again,

748
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,390
don't take it from me.

749
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,373
Take it from the 2 million people that 
are wearing this right now and getting 

750
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,460
tons of people touching their dick.
Probably tons of that.

751
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,150
So get 15% because the watch looks so 
good.

752
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,530
They're just like,
Oh shit,

753
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,320
let me grab your deck.
Not in a sexual assault way,

754
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:46,670
just like,
oh my God.

755
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,070
It's like you want it and then they

Welcome back everyone to the experience.
What am I missing us so much?

761
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,623
God,
I wish it wasn't shit my fucking diaper 

762
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:25,490
right now.
You know what?

763
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:28,460
I feel like,
I feel like Bo and Neil is my papa.

764
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,833
I should tell you got,
we were goofing around on twitter a 

765
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:33,800
little bit that drake was going to be 
here where that's unreal.

766
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,390
He,
I've just,

767
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,900
I have to stalk him a little bit later.
I have somebody,

768
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:40,700
I have a bunch of goons stalking him 
right now,

769
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:45,080
so if we can get up to 100,000
live viewers on the stream right now.

770
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,660
I don't know what we're at,
but drake will,

771
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,333
as I understand it from Fusi,
he will basically materialize until the 

772
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:54,850
podcast studio.
So yeah,

773
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,270
tell everybody to tune in because I 
told,

774
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:02,030
I'm really excited for love to arrive.
I should tell you guys,

775
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:04,250
by the way,
that Fusi reached out to me yesterday.

776
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,700
I almost had him on the show today.
I almost had him on,

777
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,730
he reached out to me and said something 
like,

778
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,850
only you can cut through the bullshit.

779
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:16,920
Yeah.

780
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,060
If you ever want me on.

781
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,110
I was like,
I said he'd save himself for you.

782
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,290
He said that.
Oh,

783
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,150
it was like his virginity.
I mean,

784
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,610
you want to,
should we find out?

785
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,893
Let's see.
I wonder if he's into giving happy 

786
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:34,410
endings,
which is every Americans God given,

787
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,530
right?
You should take all of this manic energy

788
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,364
he has and go join that guy at the city 
council meeting and all that manic 

789
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:44,760
energy and put it into rubbing my dick.
Anyway,

790
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:45,480
he,
he,

791
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,260
he contacted me and I almost had him on,
but I was like,

792
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,220
I don't know.
I learned my miss my,

793
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,960
I feel like with Isla gone,
I got to play it straight.

794
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,760
I get into trouble when needless gone.
She's back home dealing with some really

795
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:02,370
heavy duty stuff.
I gotta go do it straight.

796
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,820
I wanted to talk about what's going on 
with Ila.

797
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,141
So I was like,
I don't,

798
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:07,974
I don't,
I don't want that cirque is coming to 

799
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:09,161
here and,
and,

800
00:44:09,161 --> 00:44:09,994
and like,
I don't really care that much if I'm 

801
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:11,814
being honest.

802
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,980
You know what I mean?
I couldn't tell.

803
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,760
I mean,
what's there to say?

804
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,500
What's there to say?
The guy's insane.

805
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,120
He's in the lunatic,
right?

806
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,190
There's not really anything more to 
break down in that,

807
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,040
you know.
All right,

808
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:28,970
let's go.
Let's get on with it.

809
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,010
No,
your main guys.

810
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,003
All right,
here we go.

811
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,040
Here we go.
I'm excited.

812
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:36,660
You guys are gonna love this.

813
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:37,494

814
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,520

Okay,

815
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:43,521
so here we go.
Welcome everybody to know your meme.

816
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:48,831
The first episode featuring Joey Salads.
Do you know your meme?

817
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:52,260
Let's find out what our first caller,
Dan.

818
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:55,290
The music seems to loud.
Uh,

819
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:55,981
okay.
I mean,

820
00:44:55,981 --> 00:44:58,410
it sounds good on the stream,
but I'll pull you down.

821
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:01,230
Let's take our first call.
Laura.

822
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,080
Laura,
you're on the air.

823
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:09,060
How are Ya Laura?
Keep it together.

824
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,830
We're playing a game here.
All right.

825
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:12,960
Are you ready to play and know your 
meme?

826
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,530
All right.
Here we go.

827
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,010
Question number one.
All right,

828
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:21,520
let me turn this music off.
It's a bit money.

829
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,890
Joey's most embarrassing or recorded 
act.

830
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,993
Is it a his dick pics leaked online,
be paying in his own mouth or c being 

831
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:37,110
caught race baiting.
Fake Pranks.

832
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,470
Go ahead.
What do you think a,

833
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:45,270
B or c take you?

834
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:47,683
But I don't know.
Are we going off like what you 

835
00:45:48,861 --> 00:45:49,960
personally think or whatever?

836
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,680
This is based on his own answer.

837
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,163
I think

838
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,350
peeing in his own mouth is that final 
answer.

839
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:00,663
Yeah.

840
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,870
All right.
Hit us with it.

841
00:46:01,871 --> 00:46:03,230
Dan.
What is his answer?

842
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Gonna to be mean now.
Ooh,

843
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:19,730
good.
Damn cold.

844
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,300
It really good.
Try.

845
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,460
Really,
really good try.

846
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,260
I would have guessed peeing in his 
mouth.

847
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:29,630
That's embarrassing for most people,
but sadly,

848
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:34,100
joey is a host to many embarrassing 
moments and you were very close.

849
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:36,350
So w based,
by the way,

850
00:46:36,351 --> 00:46:38,390
you need three points.
We've got five questions,

851
00:46:38,391 --> 00:46:40,220
so all hope is not lost.
Okay.

852
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:40,950
You're good.
You got,

853
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,710
we're moving on to number two.
Okay.

854
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:48,080
What does Joey Salads like most about 
Donald Trump?

855
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:54,100
Is it a his policies be his swagger or 
see his hate for Hillary Clinton?

856
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:04,450
Take your time.
Well,

857
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:12,270
it's tough getting the mine of Joey 
Salad.

858
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,970
Enter the mind of madness.
Swagger.

859
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,320
Is that your final answer?

860
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,093
Okay.

861
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,560
You're go ahead and roll it.

862
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,140
That's right.
Swagger,

863
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,413
correct.

864
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,551
All right.
Joe,

865
00:47:41,551 --> 00:47:42,960
you to you explaining too long?
Yeah,

866
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:43,980
we got it.
We got it.

867
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,420
Yes,
that is correct.

868
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,400
His attitude,
his swagger.

869
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,340
You have,
you have successfully gotten the mind of

870
00:47:50,341 --> 00:47:54,630
salad and you're doing great.
You've got one point.

871
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,240
You need two more.
We've got three more questions.

872
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,640
Okay.
How are you feeling?

873
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:04,700
Feeling confident.
You're holding it down.

874
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:07,650
You're doing great.
Here we go.

875
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:08,484
Question three.
What percentage of Joey Salads pranks 

876
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,600
are fake?
A 50 50 b.

877
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,080
They're all fake or C,
they're all real.

878
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:33,140
Enter the mind of salad.
Take your time.

879
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,300
A,
b.

880
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,780
They're all fake.
It's a debt.

881
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,590
That's a very definite answer.
It's all answering.

882
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,100
Take.
Keep.

883
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:04,100
Take a moment and think about it.
Can you sense hands,

884
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:07,220
man?
This is not,

885
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,870
you have 10 seconds on the clock.
A,

886
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:15,450
B or c 50 50 your final answer.
Is it 50 50 Dan?

887
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:23,973

889
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,563
Mine

890
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,230
Salad.
Congratulations.

891
00:49:34,231 --> 00:49:35,064
Laura,

892
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
you are just one correct answer away 
from this brand new galaxy s nine plus.

893
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:42,503
Do you need this phone?
Will you cherish and enjoy this phone 

894
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,230
call with you,
you guys?

895
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,660
Oh yeah.
That's okay.

896
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,700
Good answer.
It's a really good answer.

897
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,260
All right.
There's two more left.

898
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,160
You only need one and he's one,
right?

899
00:50:02,161 --> 00:50:02,550
Right,
right.

900
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:03,331
Yeah.
We got this.

901
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:05,160
We got this.
Okay.

902
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:11,300
What is Joey Salads?

Tineo Salad or salad?
Dino,

909

enter the mind of salad.

910
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,520
What does your heart say that the final 
answer to the mind?

911
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,353
Meditate.
You have one more chance so don't 

912
00:50:59,531 --> 00:51:02,260
stress,
but we are running low on the clock.

913
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,860
What is your answer?
Salad.

914
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:10,420
Dino.
Is it salad?

915
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:11,350
Dino.
Dan.

916
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,213
Ah,

917
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,380
Ooh.

918
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,000
Do we have any winning music?
Dan,

919
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,440
who's been winning music?

920
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,270
I guess it's a little too emotional 
salad,

921
00:51:24,271 --> 00:51:25,380
dino.
That is three.

922
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:27,150
Correct.
Congratulations.

923
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:32,670
You're a winner.
We've got one bonus question if,

924
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,230
and let's just say it.
Let's do this.

925
00:51:34,231 --> 00:51:35,280
Okay.
Because I,

926
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:35,790
I,
you know,

927
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,830
we've got these answers from joe or 
they're all terrific.

928
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,680
So let's do this.
If you get this wrong,

929
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,230
you lose the phone.
No,

930
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,280
I'm kidding.
I wouldn't do that to you.

931
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:45,650
I'm kidding.
But let's just play.

932
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:47,070
Let's just play it for fun,
right?

933
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,520
If you get this right,
we're going to include some swag,

934
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:57,750
some extra swag.
You're going to love crazy shit,

935
00:51:57,751 --> 00:51:58,584
dude.
Basically Drake's going to show up to 

936
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:02,110
your house.
Are you,

937
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:06,450
I don't know if he'll do anything you 
want literally talked about it.

938
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,480
So that's what I'm offering you is.
Yeah.

939
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,540
I don't know if you're any of that,
but that's what's on the table.

940
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,063
Uh,
what,

941
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,460
no,

942
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:19,491
no,

943
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:19,671
no,
no,

944
00:52:19,671 --> 00:52:20,504
no,
no.

945
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,400
He's coming with much more than singing.
Okay.

946
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,420
So this really nothing on this table,
but I love the tension.

947
00:52:30,421 --> 00:52:31,570
So let's,
let's mount it.

948
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,800
Joey's,
what is Joey Salads?

949
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:39,801
Favorite type of salad dressing.
Is it a ranch?

950
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:46,970
Be Italian or C does he hate salad 
itself and a stunning,

951
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:57,270

952
00:52:57,271 --> 00:52:59,230

959
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:24,320

more and that's my personal guarantee.

963
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,020
You Dan,

964
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:40,854

965
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:43,531

969
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:52,710
That was a lot of fun.
Thank you.

970
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:57,100
You very much and God bless you.
God bless.

971
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,060
All right.
All right.

972
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,210
I think that one pretty well.
Hey I,

973
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,550
that was a lot of fun.
We were worried that people wouldn't be,

974
00:54:07,551 --> 00:54:10,820
you know,
up to snuff on the Laura Joey Trivia.

975
00:54:10,821 --> 00:54:11,654
She entered the mine of salad four out 
of five was stressful when she missed 

976
00:54:16,161 --> 00:54:17,540
the first one,
which is kind of exciting.

977
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,410
Yeah,
yeah,

978
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:21,170
no that there was ups and downs,
you know.

979
00:54:21,171 --> 00:54:22,670
Oh my God,
we got to do more on gutters.

980
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:26,650
I want to do one with like a Ethan 
Bradbury and Mo [inaudible].

981
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,583
Yeah,
I've got to think who else would be 

982
00:54:28,191 --> 00:54:29,540
really good at this.
But that was,

983
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:33,230
that was a blast.
We do the Bradbury's we could do,

984
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:37,300
we could do Mister Antonio Brown berry 
farms forever.

985
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:38,301
Uh,
guys,

986
00:54:38,301 --> 00:54:43,301
I want to look back and memorial today 
Gaddy a five as you all know,

987
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:44,803
was the great and wonderful Youtuber who
filmed himself abusing both physically 

988
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:50,834
and verbally,
his children for the amusement of 

989
00:54:52,101 --> 00:54:52,934
everyone on youtube.

990
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,360
And if I can continue my thesis of 
youtubers being garbage,

991
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,170
they shouldn't be famous.
He was really the main exhibit there.

992
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,153
Here you have a man,
like if we can pull up just an image so 

993
00:55:04,761 --> 00:55:09,140
that you all know kind of what I'm 
talking about here.

994
00:55:09,141 --> 00:55:14,141
You have a man white trash as as,
as humanly possible.

995
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:19,790
Who has found fame and fortune on 
youtube?

996
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,980
Daddy of five.
I mean,

997
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:22,843
give it up.
I mean there's nowhere else in the 

998
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:26,510
planet where a man like this,
ladies and gentlemen,

999
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,590
a man like this could ever find fame.
Look at that.

1000
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:32,183
Um,
he,

1001
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,260
he,
he,

1002
00:55:33,261 --> 00:55:38,261
he and his wife who won't say much,
but man,

1003
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:43,490
she is something him and his wife were 
abusing their kids actually have quite a

1004
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:45,410
fan base.
Half a million subscribers,

1005
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,060
hundreds of thousands of views on every 
video.

1006
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,430
And there was one that really crossed 
the line.

1007
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:52,160
The police got involved.
They actually,

1008
00:55:52,161 --> 00:55:57,161
they're convicted for child neglect.
Um,

1009
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,690
he had some kids from a previous 
marriage,

1010
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:00,860
right?
They were removed.

1011
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:02,120
They were removed.
Yes.

1012
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:02,983
Right.
And he was convicted from for child 

1013
00:56:04,581 --> 00:56:06,860
neglect and it's first channel we'll 
shut down.

1014
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:09,740
But being the intuit,
the,

1015
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,693
I won't say the industrious,
the ingenuity [inaudible] the 

1016
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,760
[inaudible] daddy oh five rebranded 
himself.

1017
00:56:19,761 --> 00:56:24,761
He returned triumphantly to youtube 
under the flag of family of five.

1018
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,270
Beautiful.
He's back.

1019
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,230
He's been back at it for several months 
until recently.

1020
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:39,160
His name came up again.
And I'm sad to say after posting another

1021
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:43,420
video of abusing his poor son,
who I'm sure,

1022
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,453
and I hate to say this about,
his son is probably going to shoot up a 

1023
00:56:46,721 --> 00:56:49,660
school in five years and I don't enjoy 
saying that,

1024
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:50,920
but I would,
I mean,

1025
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:52,780
I keep an eye on that kid and I 
appreciate it.

1026
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:53,614
I mean,
I know that I've been through a lot and 

1027
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:55,900
I love that kid.
He's a sweet guy,

1028
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,530
but when you make your kid dressed like 
this,

1029
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:06,510
that's kid's name is cody.
This kids is the fucking,

1030
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:08,940
they just bullying on this poor kid.
And he's like,

1031
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,170
man,
that's crazy.

1032
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,600
They make him wear glasses with like a 
look at this shit.

1033
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,660
They make them wear these glasses and 
it's got like the tail.

1034
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,093
So he can't drop him,
but it's like really tight around his 

1035
00:57:22,051 --> 00:57:26,490
head.
And you cannot wear sunglasses,

1036
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:29,010
protectors and not get your ass beat all
the time.

1037
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,090
You guys know what I'm talking about.
Why the fuck bro?

1038
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:36,720
Why the fuck is the god of cringe 
blowing up Google images?

1039
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,390
Talk about someone's who's challenged 
should be erased.

1040
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,720
This guy's sitting naked in the fucking 
google images.

1041
00:57:42,721 --> 00:57:43,950
I'm trying to run a show here.

1042
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,790
He got me the god of crunch.
He got you.

1043
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:50,683
He fucking got booming.
How was he so high in the ranking for 

1044
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,930
daddy or five?
I don't get that.

1045
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,230
Anyway,
he's back.

1046
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,770
It came up again and Youtube finally has
said,

1047
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:09,010
daddy have five more like daddy of 
having a channel.

1048
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:17,290
Wow.
Fucking roasted crickets on that one.

1049
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:19,903
Um,
so I thought we would look back and 

1050
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:24,710
cherish the moments we had together.
So,

1051
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,090
um,
this is from him,

1052
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:32,270
one of his new channels actually.
And I thought you guys might enjoy this.

1053
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:35,570
Once again,
cody is the subject of his ridicule.

1054
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:41,270
The title of the video.
This is a re upload dad destroys son,

1055
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:44,750
Nintendo ds and well,
I don't know about you,

1056
00:58:44,751 --> 00:58:47,780
but that's pretty much the title of a 
loving family.

1057
00:58:47,781 --> 00:58:50,960
Five overheard long.
Absolutely wants to enjoy it.

1058
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:55,993
Okay.

1059
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,120
Only on Youtube.
Can you enjoy actual child abuse?

1060
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:01,880
Yeah,

1061
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,240
one of the many fine tastes available 
here among many others.

1062
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:07,653
MMM.

1063
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,410
So it's like an episode of police,
except nobody's arresting him

1064
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,023
by the way.

1065
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:21,980
His crime,

1066
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,420
his crime is that he just keeps taking 
his dad's d s and playing it.

1067
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,650
This kid,
nothing better to do in his life.

1068
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:34,010
What a wants to play his dad's d s when 
he's not using it.

1069
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,083
Fucking piece of shit that need nerd 
needs to go down and guess who's going 

1070
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:42,650
to be the one to do it?
His Dad.

1071
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,813
Okay.

1072
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,900
What's posted?
Like what is,

1073
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,033
this is just like screeching going on in
the background fucking war zone in 

1074
01:00:00,131 --> 01:00:02,490
hundreds of thousands of views.
This is good.

1075
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:06,880
Shit is good shit.
Dan.

1076
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,690
Bad Fat cat,
his wife.

1077
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:12,550
Something like the fucking wicked witch 
about it.

1078
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,730
Way I thought was like unlike,
I mean listen to this piece of work.

1079
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,093
Okay,

1080
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:38,310
what are you cooking kids?
She's got a crazy wise man.

1081
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:40,323
I gotta tell you,
if you could make the most white trash 

1082
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:43,413
hick ass hillbilly fucks in Sim,
they wouldn't compete with family of 

1083
01:00:49,391 --> 01:00:50,224
five.
Can You Imagine Your Dad's screaming at 

1084
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:03,300
you like that?
So fun.

1085
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,130
You know everyone in his school is 
watching this dude.

1086
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,730
Sometimes you got to teach a kid a 
lesson.

1087
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,990
The worst part is like,
oh,

1088
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:28,110
that's somehow they did that.
He's putting on a good show.

1089
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:30,923
Damn,
this guy must have the emotional 

1090
01:01:31,871 --> 01:01:33,550
maturity of like a real 12 year.
I mean,

1091
01:01:33,551 --> 01:01:35,920
he's bullying magic.
Bowling your own kids.

1092
01:01:35,921 --> 01:01:40,210
Like not like being rough with them or 
tough with them.

1093
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,560
Actually bullying your own child and 
then,

1094
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:47,650
and then sitting down at a computer with
that footage,

1095
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,910
editing,
editing it.

1096
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:49,660
Well,
Dan,

1097
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,493
I have to tell you,
you're going to appreciate where this 

1098
01:01:52,631 --> 01:01:56,710
goes because his editing comes into play
and a really terrific way.

1099
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:59,230
It's an accent,
you know?

1100
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:00,480
Great.
Um,

1101
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,980
the best editing is usually invisible.
You know,

1102
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,030
this video is,
is,

1103
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,400
is marinated finally.

1104
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:13,850
All right.
Okay.

1105
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:19,980
Someone

1106
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,980
save this poor child.
He looks like a murder.

1107
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,680
He looks they're fine.
Yeah.

1108
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,020
Yay.
Yeah,

1109
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:28,381
yeah,
yeah.

1110
01:02:28,381 --> 01:02:33,381
Yay.
I imagine that's your dad.

1111
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,890
I feel like he's putting it on for the 
video too,

1112
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:41,430
but he can't tell the difference.
The kids certainly can,

1113
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:42,870
you know.
No.

1114
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:44,930
Same to them.

1115
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,553
Yeah.

1116
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,730
He's thinking right now.
This is good drama.

1117
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,313
We're getting some good shit right now.
I've squeezed some good trauma out of 

1118
01:02:54,591 --> 01:02:55,500
these kids right now.

1119
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:03,710
Teach him a lesson.
Teach that little piece of shit.

1120
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:11,450
Nice.
You got,

1121
01:03:11,451 --> 01:03:16,430
I'm good man.
Really good.

1122
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,340
He gets good.
It gets really good.

1123
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:23,840
There's a scene that one will tie a 
great scene.

1124
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:28,600
He goes to a,

1125
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,233
there's a scene where it goes to the 
garage and starts hitting it with a 

1126
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:34,140
mouse.
Notice his brother flank,

1127
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:37,620
jump kicking him in the head with no 
intervention from his parents.

1128
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,190
He goes to the garage with a mallet and 
starts smashing it.

1129
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:44,550
Where's that?
Well regarded this.

1130
01:03:44,551 --> 01:03:45,990
This is when it gets really good.
Dan,

1131
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:49,800
this is what I was referring to.
I hope you enjoyed this editing feet.

1132
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:55,310
Wow.
Wow.

1133
01:03:57,611 --> 01:04:00,920
I really wonder why it's so poorly 
adjusted to the world.

1134
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,210
Yeah.
I don't,

1135
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:09,651
I don't know,
man.

1136
01:04:09,651 --> 01:04:10,484
I just thought if I had a kid and beat 
the shit out of him and yelled at him 

1137
01:04:12,351 --> 01:04:14,900
all the time and destroyed,
it's stuff he grow up to be a good kid.

1138
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:16,760
I mean,
I worked for him,

1139
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:17,571
right?
Yeah.

1140
01:04:17,571 --> 01:04:22,571
He to I turned out great.
Yeah.

1141
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,580
Okay.
He edited end,

1142
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:31,520
sad fucking music.
Cherish this.

1143
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,420
When I heard that,
I was like,

1144
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:37,370
no fucking way.
Put that in.

1145
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,730
He's got way.
It's not for him.

1146
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:42,770
It's not for cody,
it's for the dad.

1147
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,140
The Dad's heart is broken.
I see.

1148
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:46,520
But Watch,
you'll see.

1149
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:48,620
He lays it down.
Right.

1150
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,790
We've seen enough,
cody.

1151
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,590
It's about you.
Now Watch,

1152
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:58,780
he's suffering.
Being a dad of five is tough.

1153
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,353
Sometimes you have to discipline your 
kids for the greater good because 

1154
01:05:07,281 --> 01:05:11,270
they're liars and they're thieves.
By no fault of your own.

1155
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:13,383
Life's tough and you need sad music to 
help the audience understand how 

1156
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:18,400
stressful

1157
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,233
life is.

1158
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:20,860
Okay?

1159
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,590
And you got to act really sad and upset.
Wow.

1160
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:26,940
Very consciously putting a vlog camera 
at.

1161
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,140
Make sure the framings Nice.
Let's,

1162
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:29,983
let's forget that too.
Is selfie camera work there though to 

1163
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:34,421
bill?
He's good.

1164
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:36,730
He's a pro.
But I have to say,

1165
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,673
let's,
let's definitely forget that he's 

1166
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:40,534
holding up vlog camera on one hand,
pointed at his face while having a 

1167
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:49,591
breakdown and the other hand,
damn,

1168
01:05:50,271 --> 01:05:53,000
that music has really gut wrenching.

1169
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,793
Yeah.

1170
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:00,730
And I feel so bad for so sympathetic.
I feel so bad for this.

1171
01:06:00,731 --> 01:06:04,780
Daddy.
Oh five he's for Lauren.

1172
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,063
Oh,
he doesn't care about the camera 

1173
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:10,150
anymore.
Isn't care fade to black.

1174
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,553
He died.

1175
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:14,023
Okay.

1176
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,300
Listen,
is torture room now.

1177
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,160
If you thought he was a Shitty Guy,
listen,

1178
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,170
where is he?
Oh,

1179
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,013
I see.

1180
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:34,943
I had to do it.
It really hurts him and upsets him that 

1181
01:06:37,711 --> 01:06:39,460
he had to do that.
No,

1182
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,080
you got it anyway.
Fucking good.

1183
01:06:46,081 --> 01:06:49,440
Riddens you fucking fuck that.
Fuck that guy.

1184
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,620
God Damn,
this is okay.

1185
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:55,170
Again,
this guy's famous on youtube.

1186
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:59,160
This guy has made a healthy living on 
youtube.

1187
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,673
And I get,
I don't know what my point is because 

1188
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:06,180
there's plenty of legit people on 
Youtube too.

1189
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:09,000
But um,
well and,

1190
01:07:09,001 --> 01:07:11,130
and he's gone.
Now what?

1191
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:12,990
I don't understand.
Why was he allowed back?

1192
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:14,881
Yeah.
I don't know.

1193
01:07:14,881 --> 01:07:19,170
He is his family of five channel after 
being a convicted child.

1194
01:07:19,171 --> 01:07:21,720
Neglect or was allowed to continue.
I Dunno.

1195
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:24,600
I Dunno,
but they just shut it down finally.

1196
01:07:24,601 --> 01:07:25,890
So I,
who knows,

1197
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,581
who knows?
I mean,

1198
01:07:26,581 --> 01:07:28,770
I guess better late than never,
but shit.

1199
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,520
So give it up to Daddy.
A five rest in peace.

1200
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:36,120
I fear for that.
When he loses his livelihood.

1201
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:41,020
I fear for what will become of that 
family speaking frankly point.

1202
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,033
Well we're at the bottom of the show and
I had mentioned at the top of the show 

1203
01:07:48,421 --> 01:07:49,254
that I'm healers eludes dealing with 
some stuff back home and I didn't want 

1204
01:07:53,341 --> 01:07:54,420
to talk about it cause it's really 
heavy.

1205
01:07:54,421 --> 01:07:55,254
But I do want to talk about it right now
is that I'm Ella's dad passed away 

1206
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:01,733
about,
I guess it was probably like three or 

1207
01:08:02,641 --> 01:08:06,000
four days ago now.
So it's crazy.

1208
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:11,030
It's so crazy.
Like she went there for two weeks.

1209
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:14,850
She planned to go there for two weeks 
and when she went there he was,

1210
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,363
it wasn't fun.
He was terminally ill but I mean nobody 

1211
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:22,640
expected that he was going to die during
her stay there.

1212
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:27,320
Like he,
he picked her up from the airport.

1213
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:31,120
It's just,
I dunno,

1214
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:34,370
it's been,
it's been really a wild ride for her.

1215
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,043
I mean,
she knew her dad was like terminally 

1216
01:08:38,181 --> 01:08:39,014
ill,
but like the day she arrived they were 

1217
01:08:41,491 --> 01:08:42,324
giving them radiation treatment because 
his lung cancer spread to his brain and 

1218
01:08:45,661 --> 01:08:50,070
the doctors like we really need to kill 
this tumor with radiation.

1219
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:55,200
The chance of success is really high and
it takes eight weeks for it to work.

1220
01:08:55,201 --> 01:08:58,740
So an a week after that he fucking 
passed away.

1221
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,250
Okay.

1222
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:01,990
Which is so crazy man.
Like

1223
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:07,493
I dunno,

1224
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:10,323
she's been,
she's been going through a lot and I do 

1225
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:15,910
want to say about Ilos Dad.
I have talked about them on this podcast

1226
01:09:15,911 --> 01:09:18,130
a couple of times.
Um,

1227
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:22,930
some wonderful moments I will say fondly
now

1228
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:29,130
because they were always kind of like 
not taking very seriously.

1229
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:31,960
The first great one being that he told 
me,

1230
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:35,350
he said,
[inaudible] don't ever let ethan come in

1231
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:39,490
this house if he's coming over here with
socks and sandals.

1232
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:40,503
That was my move back then.
I was wearing not just like sliders but 

1233
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:46,420
flip flops.
The one with the string in the middle.

1234
01:09:46,421 --> 01:09:47,254
So I was wearing a white sock all the 
way up and the string like shoving the 

1235
01:09:51,161 --> 01:09:52,570
socket.
It was not a good luck.

1236
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,790
And frankly I understand it's 
embarrassing.

1237
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:59,710
This is my son in law.
I thought it was funny,

1238
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:04,180
but he was serious and frankly he's a,
he's an old school guy.

1239
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:05,014
He's all about respect and integrity.
But I didn't wear sandals to the house 

1240
01:10:08,561 --> 01:10:09,394
again and frankly I don't do that 
anymore because it is pretty insane way 

1241
01:10:11,561 --> 01:10:12,460
to walk around the world.

1242
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:14,100
Okay.

1243
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:17,370
So I can,
I can and retrospect appreciate it

1244
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:24,210
that that was a changing point for me.
Straighten you out.

1245
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:29,400
The next great moment yo can on moment 
was um,

1246
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:30,653
God,
we've told the story but it's like back 

1247
01:10:32,671 --> 01:10:34,560
in the day when we first started 
youtube,

1248
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:40,470
there was this one video called shake 
that Dick and it was so obscene.

1249
01:10:40,471 --> 01:10:41,400
One,
I can't watch,

1250
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:46,430
it's so vulgar and like our videos 
weren't particularly vulgar,

1251
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:47,334
but this is the one for some reason,
the one that he actually saw and it was 

1252
01:10:50,941 --> 01:10:53,130
a parody of shake that ass.
And it was,

1253
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:54,043
are lots of closeups of me wearing like 
basketball shorts without underwear 

1254
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,580
shaking.
My Dick was disgusting and obscene.

1255
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,720
It's legit.
One of the funniest videos ever.

1256
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:06,023
And he saw,
that's the one he had to see and he 

1257
01:11:08,191 --> 01:11:08,701
says,
Isla,

1258
01:11:08,701 --> 01:11:10,560
if you guys keep making videos like 
this,

1259
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:11,423
I will.
I'm going to disown Ethan from being my 

1260
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,510
son in law.
And once again,

1261
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,840
I see,
I get it.

1262
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:21,933
You know,
I didn't know why that had to be the 

1263
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,610
one,
but that's the one.

1264
01:11:24,611 --> 01:11:26,770
But that's these a guy that was all 
about,

1265
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,820
he's old school,
he's all about respect and integrity and

1266
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,040
upholding the family name.
But I have to say

1267
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,020
he was,
he was always good to me.

1268
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:41,290
I mean when I,
when we moved to Israel for America,

1269
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:46,600
he's like a really old school dude.
He let me move in with them.

1270
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,273
He had never met me before and he let me
come and stay with them and sleep in 

1271
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:53,074
their house and he always treated me 
well and he always welcomed me and he 

1272
01:11:58,871 --> 01:11:59,704
fed me and he gave me a chance to,
to be there and work there and make it 

1273
01:12:02,681 --> 01:12:03,514
work with Ila.
And he definitely could have been like 

1274
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,000
weird guy coming saying my house.
I mean that's,

1275
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:13,030
that was a huge stretch for him.
But it definitely,

1276
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:22,200
me definitely gave us a chance that that
made it all work.

1277
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:27,783
But it's,
there was something that Ella told me 

1278
01:12:31,941 --> 01:12:35,270
that was like really I guess 
heartbreaking in a way.

1279
01:12:35,271 --> 01:12:37,610
Not Really,
but nice is that,

1280
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:41,240
you know,
he from that moment where he was like,

1281
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:43,940
we're saw shake that Dick at the 
funeral.

1282
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:44,803
Every,
all of his friends and family were 

1283
01:12:45,411 --> 01:12:46,280
telling you that.

1284
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,553
Oh God

1285
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:58,213
he was,
he was telling all of the friends and 

1286
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:07,511
family how proud he was of her and us in
particular of of what we've accomplished

1287
01:13:08,961 --> 01:13:09,794
since then.
And they were saying like he was always 

1288
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:14,930
bragging about you guys sharing your 
videos on facebook,

1289
01:13:14,931 --> 01:13:19,220
talking about you and with everybody.
And we unfriended him after the,

1290
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:20,780
the chick,
that Dick thing.

1291
01:13:20,781 --> 01:13:21,411
Cause we were like,
all right,

1292
01:13:21,411 --> 01:13:23,960
we can't,
you can't be seeing these.

1293
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:28,520
Well we didn't even know that every time
we posted a podcast or a video or a post

1294
01:13:28,521 --> 01:13:32,780
or whatever he was re he was sharing it 
on his own facebook page too.

1295
01:13:32,781 --> 01:13:36,710
His family is all school,
traditional conservative family.

1296
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:01,780
This was like the last picture they took
to get together.

1297
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:05,983
Like right when you went in the hospital
was like a week left and he's got a big 

1298
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:12,154
ass

1299
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,200
fucking smile on his face

1300
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,780
and he's rocking that teddy fresh.

1301
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:19,470
Yeah.

1302
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:20,303
And he is basically one week from death.
I mean he's in pain all the time and 

1303
01:14:24,721 --> 01:14:25,350
like,
I dunno,

1304
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:28,080
just the fact that he mustered that big 
smile for Ila,

1305
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,830
rocking that teddy fresh.
I mean he was,

1306
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:36,870
he was a great one and it was a true 
supporter and he really enabled us to,

1307
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:42,680
to thrive and succeed in Israel.
I know I got thinking about like,

1308
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:50,190
I've been thinking a lot about just this
whole concept of like saying goodbye.

1309
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,320
It's like we're always,
it's like,

1310
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,210
it's so hard,
but like we're not ready.

1311
01:14:54,211 --> 01:14:55,044
We're not trained at all.
Like we don't ever think about death or 

1312
01:14:57,211 --> 01:15:00,630
like how to say goodbye to loved ones or
even for us to say goodbye.

1313
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:03,810
We don't confront death.
It's always like swept under the rug.

1314
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:07,893
Um,
and my band mate and my really good 

1315
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:12,124
friend,
Isaac's mom also passed away suddenly 

1316
01:15:13,751 --> 01:15:14,584
earlier this year.
So we made a little song that we 

1317
01:15:18,071 --> 01:15:23,071
dedicated to Ella's dad and Isaac's mom.
So that's the end of the show.

1318
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,670
I hope you guys enjoy this song.
Thanks for watching.

1319
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,063

Taught me how to say no.
Didn't teach me how to say,

1337
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,860
