1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,290
Come to your five or three.
Two.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,270
Hello everybody.
And thanks for coming to the AC pod.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,220
That's my announcer voice.
Hey everybody.

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,410
And someone's just your voice.
It's not that different all the time.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,740
Happy thanksgiving.
So thankful for you all.

6
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:29,580
Joining us here today.
We pulled into the parking lot and there

7
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:33,150
was nobody there and I was like,
Holy Shit.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,393
It was difficult.
I would tell you it was difficult to 

9
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:39,020
come in today.
I had a big ass meal.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,030
I could barely move,
but we did it.

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,060
We came in,
we did it.

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,090
So thank you.
So God bless.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,393
Today's episode is sponsored by 
postmates dollar shave club and Vince 

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,160
Sero.
How was all of your thanksgiving?

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,360
How was your thanksgiving?
You luckily you made,

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,980
I know her food.
Yeah,

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,290
so I enjoyed some food,
but I don't like the Thanksgiving food.

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,460
You know what?
Can I make a confession?

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,600
I don't like Turkey.
It's the most boring meet imaginable and

20
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,270
it's like the Gamey.

21
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,570
It's dry usually it's just,
it's not there.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,550
It's just now it's not a word of the 
bird.

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,760
And you read it with the cranberry,
cranberry.

24
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,594
What else?
I know there's people at home who were 

25
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,670
like,
yeah,

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,830
I know it's a very polarizing thing.
I don't like stuffing.

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,510
I don't like cranberry.
I don't like Turkey.

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,260
But I took Thanksgiving it to my own 
hands because I said,

29
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:38,094
you know what?
I'm going to make a pot roast and I 

30
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:44,820
would like to call these Ethan's 
heavenly potatoes.

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,433
True cause I wanted to make sure isla 
could eat and what Ethan's heavenly 

32
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:53,730
mashed potatoes and let me tell you,
okay,

33
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,773
I'll tell you what's in it.
But that doesn't do any good because 

34
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:59,040
it's all about the technique.
When people see what's in it,

35
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,220
they can't believe that it's going to 
taste good.

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,380
Well sure.
And you should be,

37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,510
you should be horrified by what I put in
it.

38
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,590
But that's the secret to every good 
restaurants cooking,

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,260
you know what I mean?
Is that's why food at restaurants tastes

40
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,094
so unbelievably good.
It's because if you actually went back 

41
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:17,064
there in the kitchen,
you would never have the balls to cook 

42
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:20,940
food the way they do.
Like,

43
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,863
you know,
putting a whole stick of butter and for 

44
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,510
like two eggs scrambled eggs,
you're like,

45
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,650
oh,
these scrambled eggs are amazing.

46
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,710
I never had my eggs.
Never tastes like this before.

47
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,663
There's a whole stick of butter.
So what I do is I put a whole stick of 

48
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:42,831
butter and a whole block of cream shoes 
for every four potatoes.

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,290
So yesterday was two.
Yeah,

50
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,870
there was eight potatoes to a whole 
sticks of butter and two whole blocks of

51
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,930
cream cheese.
And I hear dad freaking out in the back,

52
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,640
but I'm talking,
I mean that sounds bomb,

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,170
but it is bombed Dan.

54
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,730
It,
it just tastes like potatoes.

55
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,330
It doesn't even taste crazy airy.
It's a slight,

56
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,373
it tastes incredible.
You can eat ham mouthfuls of mouthfuls 

57
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:10,390
and little do you know that every bite 
has probably 200 calories.

58
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,370
I love mashed potatoes is the best dish 
you ever like potatoes by themselves are

59
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:18,360
already pretty unhealthy,
but then you like,

60
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,660
or like heavy,
heavy,

61
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,630
let's say.
There's just nothing really good in it I

62
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:23,860
guess.
But it's not unhealthy.

63
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,150
No,
I'm not a nutritionist.

64
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:25,984
I'm not even gonna claim that.
I don't make claims on this podcast 

65
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,590
anymore.
I don't know.

66
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,880
What's funny,
I didn't even know that.

67
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,310
My name is Ethan.
I cannot confirm or deny that.

68
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:35,440
My name is Ethan,
allegedly.

69
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,290
Allegedly.
My name is Ethan and it was Thanksgiving

70
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,240
yesterday.
Don't hold me to that though.

71
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,460
Um,
and come the expose videos about my name

72
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,670
not be,
um,

73
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,400
anyway,
these potatoes aren't credible or hit.

74
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,940
I got this pressure cooker instant pot.
Have you guys heard of this?

75
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:59,110
Whole crazy,
I had two massive pot roasts.

76
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:00,550
I put in there for two hours.

77
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,590
I got to tell you,
nobody cared about the Turkey.

78
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,190
I had a pity bite just so my sister 
didn't feel bad.

79
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,740
Your sister cooked all them bay,
not Turkey.

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,150
I know.
And that's what I'm saying.

81
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,790
When you came in two hours,
I pop it in,

82
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,624
I set it and forget it.
And all of a sudden it's a smash potato 

83
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,810
heaven.
I care so much about smashed potatoes,

84
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,680
mashed potatoes,
mashed potatoes,

85
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,900
and it's so important that they be 
right.

86
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,820
You know,
and on all day,

87
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,990
but and add any,
right.

88
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:33,670
I hope you Dan,
how was your thanksgiving?

89
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,760
It was great.
It was really nice,

90
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:38,760
actually saw a bunch of extended family 
I haven't seen in years.

91
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:40,350
So that was cool.
And uh,

92
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,220
yeah,
it was nice.

93
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,830
Good food.
You're vegetarian.

94
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:46,140
Were they able to accommodate you?
They did accommodate.

95
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,090
It was very nice to them.
Um,

96
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,223
the,
uh,

97
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,440
the wife of my uncle,
I guess my aunt in law,

98
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,660
if that's the thing.
She's a vegetarian too,

99
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,790
so she hooked it up.
So thank you to that.

100
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,873
What is,
what is the vegetarian eat on 

101
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:00,660
Thanksgiving?
Uh,

102
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,523
well,
I mean most of the sides are vegetarian 

103
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:04,020
and they,
they made sure the,

104
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,400
like the stuffing,
you know,

105
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,234
usually the stuffing isn't vegetarian,
but they made vegetarian stuffing and 

106
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:10,590
you know,
the cranberries and I know you,

107
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,873
I know how you feel about it.

108
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,610
Yes.
And in Anzac,

109
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,610
everyone had a good time.
Everyone's happy.

110
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:18,380
Everyone's satisfied,
I hope.

111
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,720
Definitely.
Yeah,

112
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,010
it was a,
I mean,

113
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm not a big fan of Turkey either,
but who is,

114
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:25,770
yeah,

115
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,690
no,
I mean some people like it.

116
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,583
We're also not fans of the pies.
So there was a bunch of Pumpkin pie and 

117
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,090
I don't,
you know,

118
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,100
I don't want to offend too many people 
here.

119
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,700
I know I'm going to start a whole new 
way of,

120
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:42,701
of uh,
but I don't like Pumpkin Pie,

121
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,200
but Ian about it and he made a chocolate
pie.

122
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,000
Thank God for that.
Well,

123
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:51,980
at any rate,
listen to,

124
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,780
um,
but that's not enough of that.

125
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,080
I'm glad everyone had a happy 
Thanksgiving and I'm glad you're here.

126
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:01,250
What black Friday as you all know,
let's get to the real business,

127
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:02,300
which is today,
right?

128
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,590
Yeah.
Today's black Friday.

129
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,240
Oh yeah.
Good.

130
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,520
I got,
I got to appreciate this top light.

131
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,273
Like it's so amazing how the sandwich 
and then like first of all you've got 

132
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:18,910
this beautiful thick ass and then even 
the hand and the top right.

133
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,200
Oh,
perfect.

134
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,543
It's just incredible.
I actually had an awkward moment with 

135
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:25,424
this because a,
I was looking at my phone at 

136
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:27,644
Thanksgiving and saw you tweet this and 
I started laughing my ass off and 

137
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,820
immediately my family like,
what are you laughing?

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,150
What are you looking at?
I would like,

139
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
I was like,
I don't really want to show you that.

140
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,390
Do you consider the picture of my boss?
Here you go.

141
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,850
You consider this open face sandwich,
not safe for work then I,

142
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,880
yeah,
that's why I was like,

143
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,930
to be honest it's a little lewd,
but that's fine.

144
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:47,151
It,
yeah,

145
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:49,070
that might have to be,
that might have to be switched.

146
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:49,904
Not Safe for work isn't very gross to 
you and naked except my balls drip down 

147
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:59,620
to the bottom of that toast for that.
Um,

148
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,050
J that James Bald double o seven.
You're,

149
00:07:02,051 --> 00:07:04,960
you're alleging real dude.
See y Ella likes me.

150
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,673
So today's black Friday and there's a 
tradition in America to stomp the face 

151
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:16,240
of every grandma and the way of your new
ps four.

152
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,120
But I have to say this year we had a 
mellow,

153
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,490
mellow year.
I didn't see any fights.

154
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,860
I didn't see any babies thrown across 
walmart.

155
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,190
I didn't see any,
uh,

156
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,480
ambulances picking up 90 year olds,
nothing like that.

157
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,314
I think the stores have finally gotten 
smart and it's more like the older 

158
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:34,630
videos are surfacing again.
Yeah.

159
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,150
Cause we have our craving those uh,
yeah,

160
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,450
I noticed that.
Yeah.

161
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,000
There's all these slick guys on Youtube.
Just they re upload all the old shit and

162
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:43,834
they say Thanksgiving Black Friday,
fight 2018 and disable the comments and 

163
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:50,950
then every year.
But there's no really juicy,

164
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,720
fresh a fight.
Memes.

165
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,900
I think enough people died and got 
trampled.

166
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,090
When I watch those old videos,
I'm like my God,

167
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:03,091
how did they not they you need to have 
order in your store.

168
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,733
But what we did find was some free.
So what I've got here is a little 

169
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:11,440
segment called black Friday around the 
world.

170
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,270
Yes.
Um,

171
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,490
here we go.
I've got USA,

172
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:19,510
Canada and Brazil.
How do you think this will go?

173
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:22,950
Let's start in the United States and see
what black Friday is like there.

174
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,980
This one,
I couldn't tell if it was from this year

175
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:31,280
because there's,
so again,

176
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,830
people are starting pretty calm leading.
Exactly.

177
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Excuse me.
He thought,

178
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,810
doesn't it look like at night?
It just blows my mind.

179
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:54,811
Imagine him waking up at three M.
I mean we tried once,

180
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,940
but we didn't make it.
I mean,

181
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,580
this is your day off.
This is Thanksgiving Day.

182
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,453
You spend your day at 3:00
AM trying to find most of the sales on 

183
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:06,380
line.
No.

184
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,213
Yeah.
You don't need,

185
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,120
I don't know.
Some places do these crazy in deals,

186
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,920
but it's like they're trying to start a 
riot,

187
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,600
you know?
Yeah.

188
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,270
You got it.
We need to order Walmart.

189
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,010
Oh,
we're supposed to play the thing,

190
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:20,844
right?

191
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,560
Yeah.
You got to hit me with that.

192
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:27,460
Zach,
did Zach Know Walmart theme song?

193
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:27,811
Oh,
he does?

194
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:28,644
Yeah.

195
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,210
You guys met with that.
We thought this was good.

196
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,573
Everybody.
Yeah.

197
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,570
Well one my hey,
throw it up now.

198
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,103
Yeah,

199
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,430
that's right.
Absolutely.

200
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,713
For audio listeners,
there's just hoards of people grabbing 

201
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,650
Kellan nearly in a riot.
You're of people jumping over escalators

202
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,910
from grabbing television lenders.
I mean,

203
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,670
there you have it.
There you have it.

204
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,060
So that is black fret.
You want to watch that Ila?

205
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,370
Yeah.
Not like we have anything better to do.

206
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,690
My favorite right now we are.
We are Walmart.

207
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,660
Yes sir.
Those everyone would lyrics.

208
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,460
Oh,
you serious?

209
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,960
And when you typed it and I love that.

210
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,360
Okay.

211
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,440
I guess a manager at Walmart wanted to 
do a little hype video for their people.

212
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,510
They get excited for black Friday.
I think it was the day.

213
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,023
Yeah.

214
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,430
Has the best.
This has employee in the century.

215
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,260
Nobody gets paid enough to do this.
Now I kill myself.

216
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,350
That's right.
Uh,

217
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,560
we uh,
Walmart.

218
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,643
Yeah.

219
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,290
They just gave this guy a 25 cent raise.
He's all stuff.

220
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,270
Did he say he got blood on your face?
What?

221
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,080
I was thinking you have

222
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,350
blood on your face.
Is that what black Friday is for them?

223
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,240
Oh,
you're going to be be a cashier

224
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,340
some day.
Really dream.

225
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,620
Dream big.
What do you got on?

226
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,760
You're going to be a cashier someday.
You got blood on your face.

227
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,470
It would be,
oh,

228
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,300
you love this.

229
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,070
Okay.
Yeah.

230
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,710
You got blood on your face.
You love this place.

231
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,030
Really?
Because those images seem contrary.

232
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,890
Hmm.
You'll be a thing.

233
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:17,320
We did the one with the lyrics.
You're right.

234
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,100
We need this to cut it.
What's that one?

235
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,980
What's that one?
Youtube channel.

236
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:21,940
That d codes.
Lyrics.

237
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:26,941
Genius.
Genius though website.

238
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,420
We need a genius.
A on Walmart fights on analysis.

239
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,250
You,
you may be a cashier someday.

240
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,670
If you play your cards right at Walmart.

241
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I want to hire two more times.
Give them a great,

242
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,450
I think this guy's doing this bullet 
for,

243
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,460
I'm pretty sure this constitutes cruel 
and usual

244
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,030
punishment and constitutional under the 
United States law.

245
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,550
I love that quote.
That's great.

246
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,440
So here you have it.
Black Friday in America.

247
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,500
God bless these wonderful country here 
we have black Friday and Canada.

248
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,440
It's,
it's crazy.

249
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:24,940
I love this orderly.
They're getting a round of applause.

250
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,163
That's fine.
Looks like congratulations on wasting 

251
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:31,690
your holiday.
Well,

252
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,340
they're Canadians.
Look how wonderful this is.

253
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:34,174
It probably served coffee.
They're just walking in super orderly 

254
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:41,370
and calm.
The employees are lined up and giving up

255
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,500
ground look like giving high fives and 
then have a five.

256
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,540
Wow.
What a,

257
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,380
what a joy.

258
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,610
What a thrill.
What a thrill.

259
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,410
Um,
you know what I was thinking,

260
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,020
I was watching that it just takes one 
lunatic to start running and it sets off

261
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:59,070
that chain reaction.
No,

262
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,900
no,
no.

263
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,531
Probably.
Well,

264
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:01,364
you,
I think if one person from the bottom 

265
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:04,730
started cutting and running a front,
that's it.

266
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,380
Full riot mode and America,
you got five of those from the beginning

267
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,214
and nobody ever had a chance,
but there you have it black Friday and 

268
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:14,630
Canada.
And now finally,

269
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:19,631
as you all know,
Brazil is as a crime ridden country.

270
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,110
There's huge disparities of very rich 
and very poor.

271
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,570
Lots of corruption.
It's a rough place.

272
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:29,420
So black Friday in Brazil,
as you can imagine,

273
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,950
there's going to be one of the craziest 
things you ever see.

274
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,443
And so I warn people with young children
and who are sensitive to trigger 

275
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:43,790
warnings to a divert their eyes from 
this very graphic scene.

276
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,700
Black Friday and breasts here.
But I see it.

277
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,750
I got the mascot.
Some girl was,

278
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,010
I don't know.
Yeah.

279
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,300
Um,
yeah.

280
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,003
So they're,
all the employees are lined up at the 

281
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:02,804
gate and they're about to start pounding
it to get everyone outside super 

282
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,790
heightened.
When here we go,

283
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,230
they got a Dj by the sound of this.
They're pounding on the wall.

284
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:18,410
Get ready everybody.
Here we go.

285
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,540
Well,
it's going to come through shit

286
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,450
completely empty.
There's not a thing of person outside,

287
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,200
not even one single person out that 
nobody's there.

288
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,203
Incredible.
I wonder how they missed this violated 

289
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,590
or got in trouble for it.
Yeah,

290
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,650
we're going to get the monetize for 
sure.

291
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,090
I find it fascinating that nobody peeked
outside.

292
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,153
You know what I mean?
I love how they're pounding on the gay 

293
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,880
and there's got a Dj in the mascot,
not even one person got the memo,

294
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,190
not even one person.
So there you have it.

295
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,780
And Lou have anything interesting to 
talk about this black Friday,

296
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,830
black Friday around the world.
And on the topic of Thanksgiving,

297
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,470
we are a very topical show.
If nothing else.

298
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,980
Barney at the Thanksgiving Day parade,
macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.

299
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:29,670
Excuse me.
Thank you though.

300
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,653
In 1997 was murdered.
So the lane gunned down by the New York 

301
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:41,630
state police and we talk a lot here on 
the show about police brutality.

302
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,800
Well this is police brutality.
Uh,

303
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,190
the worst I've seen

304
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,500
and a long,
long time.

305
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,190
So this is more of a,
a memorial

306
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,820
for Barney.
Oh,

307
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,990
this is amazing.
Actually.

308
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:57,160
So it was really windy winter day.
Um,

309
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,710
and the bar new flow,
just it

310
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,013
so out of hand.

311
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,210
This video reminds me of Gulliver's 
travels then people,

312
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,300
oh yeah,
the rope over.

313
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,560
I'm in there trying to take him out.

314
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,640
Hi.

315
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,410
This is probably the most,
well,

316
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,040
the people on the ground.
I also barneys floating everywhere.

317
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,530
He's completely out of control and 
people on the ground or wrestling.

318
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,810
It's almost like a dragon.
I feel like I'm watching a movie.

319
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,200
The logical battle I'm trying to like,
well,

320
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:45,201
a mythical beast.
Um,

321
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,350
let me skip to where it goes.
It's

322
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,183
real spicy.

323
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,140
The crowd is a balloon as they should 
be.

324
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:54,930
This is,
you can see that people.

325
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,210
Oh Wow.
Why is that rope filling?

326
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,000
Everyone's dressed up at,
it's a bunch of young.

327
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,280
Oh,
I thought they were all ladies,

328
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:07,380
but they're just up is like gnomes or 
something.

329
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,150
What's he going to hang it off?
Even literally got people just as gnomes

330
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,280
clinging onto ropes for dear life.
I mean,

331
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:15,270
it's incredible.
Hi,

332
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,120
this is the site of Santa's workshop 
that we have not seen before.

333
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,410
The dressed is Barney.
Yeah.

334
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,240
Oh,
Barney's Barney.

335
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,310
Barney's holding I,
but they were known Stan.

336
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,383
Why can't they?

337
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,090
It could be no.
Ooh.

338
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,780
So I wonder if you would get mad and 
then it splits.

339
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:42,740
Hawaii don't fit under the Gust of wind.
They fighting to quell

340
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,823
beast.

341
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,030
You're like a five year old.
You Love Barney music.

342
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,223
The audience is losing their mind 
because this is the most exciting thing 

343
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:53,860
they've ever seen in Thanksgiving Day 
parade.

344
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,073
MMM.

345
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,430
You think you could get taken out if 
that thing just tumbled into the crowd?

346
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,560
It's massive.
Probably.

347
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,020
Yes sir.
They fill those up with helium.

348
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:13,060
Is that what they do to make them flow?
My bad.

349
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,360
So yeah,
because it isn't a hillary,

350
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,370
I'm like a precious resource,
like a lot of helium.

351
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,103
I'm sure that pressures,
I've heard that it's a finite resource 

352
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:27,040
that cannot be replenished.
So that was a good thing.

353
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,850
We're using it for important things.
Yes sir.

354
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,870
Barney Barney,
uh,

355
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,770
this is when it gets really violent.
And again,

356
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:39,520
I have to give a trigger warning here 
for people.

357
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,680
We're sensitive.
The violent,

358
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,683
uh,
content because as you're about to see 

359
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:46,114
the boys and black,
the police are about to make a violence 

360
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:53,260
slang of this innocent bystander.
I mean,

361
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:56,350
what did Barney ever do except try to 
entertain the kids in here?

362
00:19:56,351 --> 00:20:00,010
He has been gun down,
taken down in cold blood.

363
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:00,844
I mean,
he's just a brother trying to live his 

364
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:03,850
life.
You know what I mean?

365
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,210
Just trying to enjoy the parade.
Got It.

366
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:13,320
Bring the dinosaur down.
Humans always keeping the dinosaur down.

367
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:13,861
I mean,
God,

368
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:15,300
there's no justice in this world.

369
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,953
You know,

370
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,550
I need some human rights activists to 
take a look at this foot.

371
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,660
Yes.
His body is splitting apart.

372
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,780
Yeah.
If you're a Barney lover,

373
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:33,330
this is got to be some traumatic 
footage.

374
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,203
Yeah.

375
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,353
Okay.

376
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,540
Here come the police guys.
So again,

377
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,600
sensitive morning here,
here they come up with a foot.

378
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,900
They starting to stab him at the feet.
Please.

379
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,390
Oh,
oh,

380
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,470
this is,
I got,

381
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,543
I gotta commend these brave officers.
Honestly climb on top of that with a 

382
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,370
knife.
That's pretty daunting.

383
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,043
Does it remind you of Goldberg traveled 
like it seriously feels like they're 

384
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:15,570
bringing down a dragon or some shit.
It's kind of mythical.

385
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:16,404
You're right.
Yeah.

386
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:23,430
And on the day of November 22nd,
1997,

387
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,950
the dragon was plain.
They decapitating him look out there,

388
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,690
cut again.
And their gap with dating goes,

389
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,100
where's Jesse Ventura?
Brutal.

390
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,040
Brutal.
Yeah.

391
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,020
Exciting.
I had never seen that before.

392
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:42,854
Kind of a thrill.
Kind of a joy on this beautiful 

393
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:47,990
thanksgiving day either.
What do you know about thanksgiving?

394
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:50,320
Because you are an immigrant to this 
country.

395
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,050
Uh,
you know nothing about no.

396
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,750
The Turkey.
Oh,

397
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,160
and you say thanks.
I think that's probably what most people

398
00:21:58,161 --> 00:21:58,821
know about it.
You know,

399
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:00,950
we never said thanks at dinner.
That's true.

400
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,240
Should we do it now?
No.

401
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,850
It could be exciting.
What am I thankful for?

402
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,540
What am I truly thankful for?
Well,

403
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,530
clearly you.

404
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,883
MMM,

405
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,313
clearly I'm thankful for you and 
everything good in my life was a result 

406
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:24,670
of,
um,

407
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,940
I'm thankful for this is so long.
Yeah,

408
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,220
we want to do it,
but it's great,

409
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,383
isn't it?
No,

410
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,223
not good content.
I have a black Friday deal state you 

411
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,980
might be thankful for.
Oh yeah,

412
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:39,580
let's try to segue out of this.
Um,

413
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,010
okay,
let's do that.

414
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,890
So go ahead.
He looked put together a segment for us.

415
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:47,090
I mean,
how exciting is this?

416
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,270
Although we own and you to open them.
Oh Shit.

417
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,050
Um,
it's three 30 food.

418
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:55,910
Take a break or do you want to do a 
segment first?

419
00:22:55,911 --> 00:22:56,690
Yeah,
we should.

420
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,523
Okay.
So when we come back from our break Ila 

421
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,770
as put together black Friday deals that 
nobody wants,

422
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,110
and there's some hilarious stuff on 
here,

423
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,280
like the dollar tree,
everything's $1 today only.

424
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,770
And so much more today on the HV podcast
takes giving extravaganza,

425
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,233
uh,

426
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,223
as usual,
your stomach and the rest of your life 

427
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,220
are at war.
You need to eat,

428
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,230
but you can't stop what you're doing to 
deal with it.

429
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,860
And the only fast things that deliver 
are not what you want.

430
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:33,963
I've had this problem all the time.
Your favorite restaurant doesn't 

431
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:38,830
deliver?
Well now they do with postmates.

432
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,320
Yes.
The APP that adds a delivery option two,

433
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:44,110
your favorite restaurants.
But that's not all.

434
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,830
You forgot eggs,
milk.

435
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,020
No problem.
They'll go to the grocery store.

436
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,630
You want that tasty burger from your 
favorite place,

437
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,523
no problem.
They'll go there even though they don't 

438
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,240
deliver you looking even for a bottle of
wine or summer beer,

439
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,370
throwing a pack of smokes.
If that's your thing,

440
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,820
no problem.
They will do anything for you.

441
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,880
And it's so freaking convenient.
I cannot endorse postmates enough and as

442
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:09,074
they say,
it is your new longterm munchies booty 

443
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:12,434
call.

444
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,600
Although a parent item went in.
Yeah,

445
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,720
don't try anything on your driver.
I don't think that's what that means.

446
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,230
Um,
I love postmates so much.

447
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,093
Just give it a shot and you're going to 
see how fricking incredible and 

448
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:27,710
convenient and mind blowing.

What I love the most is that I never 
have to go to the store.

460
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,653
That's because dollar shave club

463
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,240

No matter what you're getting ready for.

467
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:25,094
they've got it.
And they have this new program where 

468
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:30,080
they automatically keep you stocked up 
on the products you use.

469
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:32,570
You determine what you want and when you
want it,

470
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,553
and it shows up right at your door from

475
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,620

was so lush and beautiful and smelled

Fortunately it did not look good,

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:20,060
I'll gramar winter warm for wall 
steering wheel cover with handbrake.

610
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,120
Oh,
the handbrake cover comps.

611
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:24,440
So you can match.
Yes.

612
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,980
If you're wondering,
the carpet does match the drapes.

613
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,143
That's right.
Yeah.

614
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,570
Okay.
This would be dangerous all.

615
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,300
Yes sir.
You live as oh,

616
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:38,590
grammar's always in constant threat of 
invasion.

617
00:33:38,591 --> 00:33:39,424
So is your safety in this car?
The nice stuff is probably the best 

618
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,254
offer at the dollar tree.

that's right.

620
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,723
Wait,
are you saying that stuff at the dollar 

621
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,170
tree isn't always a dollar?
That's right.

622
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,170
Again,
what?

623
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,453
It's a loophole and gray area that 
somehow they managed to find that's 

624
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:08,890
right.
Also advertising man.

625
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,730
Well,
I feel like inflation's got to the point

626
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:14,060
where now they just think if it's on a 
dollar so clean,

627
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,261
like if it's one,
two,

628
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:19,580
three then they're like,
it's multiple of a dollars,

629
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,603
but today,
only today the dollar tree is actually 

630
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:30,650

648

I know.

656
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,693
Incredible.
I think we may have sold a couple of 

657
00:36:24,831 --> 00:36:29,180
garth's broken anthology books I'm 
buying right now.

658

And it's like stop live switching.
It's just on the long shot because he's

buying all these anthologies.

660
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,410
I like that.
And I do like that.

661
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,680
So the,
here's a story that I absolutely love.

662
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,813
Dude wants to legally change his h.
Why does he want to legally change his 

663
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:53,770
days from 69 to 49 because it will help 
him get more dates on tinder.

664
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,100
Oh my God.
Understandable.

665
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:02,000
At 69 69 that's right.
Here we have it here.

666
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,940
There's about a little video about it 
because a legend man,

667
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,160
you just try to fuck.
He's like,

668
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:09,110
dude,
nobody wants to fuck a 69 year old.

669
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,350
Well my Dick,
I got a 49 year old.

670
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:17,351
Dick is still 69 we can 69 but I'm 49

671
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,003
and I,
I feel I suffer on the my age because 

672
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:33,420
I'm much more younger.
Demos 68 so when I ask for a mortgage,

673
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:34,320
for example,
they say,

674
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,560
is it possible if I go on tinder?
You know,

675
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:38,903
I never thought about it that you can't 
get a mortgage at all age cause you'll 

676
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:43,170
die before he can pay it off.
Oh,

677
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,580
isn't that gnarly?
Wow.

678
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,470
I never thought about that.
Yeah,

679
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,680
this guy,
he's 49 you're could live,

680
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,350
but I guess they don't take the risks.
They're like,

681
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:54,690
did you want a mortgage?
You're 69 ish.

682
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,153
I'll give you five years tops the 
mortgage bankers like you want a 

683
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:01,350
mortgage?
I'll give you a 30 year

684
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:09,420
from 68 or 69 when the woman are there 
and when I'm mocked in the,

685
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:11,630
you know the,
then they say,

686
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,640
okay,
then lie for your eight.

687
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:16,850
You say you are 49 I don't want to lie,
I want to be myself.

688
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,380
So don't force me to lie.
But when I am really 49 again,

689
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,440
I will have a baby again.
I will buy a new car again,

690
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,430
I will pay my house again.
I go outside and I invest my money again

691
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,320
because now I'm old man.
You know,

692
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,440
I have to save my money to give to my 
kids so they can live.

693
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,060
But if I have that h

694
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,873
I have hope again,
I'm new again and there is the whole 

695
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:41,320
future is there for me again.
All right.

696
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,560
Iron clad logic right there.
So I wanted to say,

697
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,423
well I,
I know there's been a lot of debate 

698
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:48,394
about changing genders and this kind of 
whole thing and that gender is a 

699
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,253
construct,
a social construct and people changing 

700
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:56,494
sex.
And all this,

701
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,300
you know,
we can debate about,

702
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,343
uh,
we can debate about gender roles and 

703
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,430
that old things time however I think is 
indisputable,

704
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:09,970
at least right now as far as we all 
know,

705
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:14,971
time is a linear fact.
I don't think we're time traveling yet.

706
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,323
He's like,
he described himself as a young God is 

707
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:29,861
he did you,
he said a 69 year old,

708
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:31,754
he's a positivity guru.
He says he does not feel his age and it 

709
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:36,044
started a battle to make himself 
illegally 20 years younger on the 

710
00:39:38,181 --> 00:39:40,790
grounds that he's being discriminated on
dating apps.

711
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:47,260
Doctors told him his body was that of a 
45 year old man and he described himself

712
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:52,370
as a young God.
Yes,

713
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,413
that judge expressed skepticism,
but also noted that changing the sex on 

714
00:39:56,301 --> 00:39:59,780
a birth certificate as a transgender 
people have the right to do that,

715
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:00,614
which was once impossible is now allowed
tension or people around the world have 

716
00:40:03,591 --> 00:40:07,340
fought long battles of the right to 
change their birth certificates to match

717
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,250
their gender identity.
Where this is permitted,

718
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:12,350
the legal requirements vary in the 
Netherlands.

719
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:13,184
Transgender people need a statement from
an expert affirming that they have a 

720
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,790
purr,
purr,

721
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,103
permanent conviction that their gender 
does not match what is on their birth 

722
00:40:21,231 --> 00:40:23,720
certificate and that they understand the
repercussions of their decision.

723
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,913
But again,
here,

724
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,280
you know,
that's uh,

725
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,143
gender is a kind of an abstract idea in 
a sense that it's not a physical the 

726
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:36,680
idea.
But here we're talking about age.

727
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:37,943
I mean

728
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,910
we can debate age,
right.

729
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:46,160
But apparently the judge is actually,
it's unlikely to happen,

730
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:48,760
but the judge is like open minded about 
it too.

731
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,541
I mean,
what,

732
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:50,051
what,
what,

733
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:52,790
what does our world be when people 
decide their own age?

734
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,510
Like a 13 year old or like an 18 old 
being like I'm 20,

735
00:40:56,511 --> 00:41:01,511
I am actually 21 it's an emotional age 
and they call it an emotional age.

736
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,070
Dude,
what's wrong?

737
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,090
Uh,
imagine.

738
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,580
Uh,
I you do it.

739
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,563
You know,

740
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,171
I like he,
oh,

741
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:21,004
he almost talks that if he was able to 
change his age to like 45 that he'd be 

742
00:41:24,371 --> 00:41:26,230
like,
he's like my Dick will work again.

743
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,303
Yeah.
And like it will like magically like 

744
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,800
actually reverses age.
I can get a mortgage,

745
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:37,610
my Dick will work there.
You have it.

746
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,030
What do you think?
You know that's a weird one.

747
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,420
He looks pretty good for 69.
I'll give him that.

748
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,520
Maybe he is a young God,

749
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,100
but you should embrace.
Hmm.

750
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,180
I think his problem is that would look 
old for 49.

751
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

752
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,153
Dude,
that's 20 years and once you're that 

753
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,070
old,
every decade is like hit you harder than

754
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:06,650
the last.
I think he's just like,

755
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:11,060
I don't want to fuck,
I don't want to fuck 69 year olds.

756
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,270
He's looking on tinder.
It's all these old ladies.

757
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:15,104
He's like,
I want to fuck these hot ass 49 year 

758
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:19,610
old,
these four.

759
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:22,940
Have you seen these 49 year olds?
They're banging their hot as hell.

760
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,540
My Dick will work if I could only change
my age.

761
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:37,450
Uh hmm.
Do you think he really believes it or is

762
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:38,800
he,
is he full of Shit?

763
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,873
Well,
you had mentioned damn that it was some 

764
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:41,760
what,
what?

765
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,980
Uh,
I,

766
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,430
it's hard to say.
All the articles I've read,

767
00:42:45,431 --> 00:42:46,264
it seemed to take it very seriously.
But you've said that you had read 

768
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:48,940
something that it's some kind of 
protein.

769
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,033
Yeah,
I thought I had seen somewhere that 

770
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:52,920
he's,
he's trying to,

771
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,180
um,
yeah,

772
00:42:54,181 --> 00:42:55,014
I mean like you,
you brought up the whole gender issue 

773
00:42:56,671 --> 00:42:57,504
thing.
I think he maybe is trying to make a 

774
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,370
point about that.
But yeah,

775
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,204
I mean like you said,
I mean obviously it's pretty fucking 

776
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,980
difference session.
Awful.

777
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,230
Yeah.

778
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,700
You know,
I see people always trying to make this

779
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,603
my,
are you really gonna compare that to a 

780
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:13,220
gender issue?

781
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:18,090
One is like measurably wrong.
Like,

782
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,470
okay,
you're by people who will say,

783
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,460
Oh,
you're bowling with the Dick.

784
00:43:20,461 --> 00:43:21,294
That makes you a man.
But still you can identify more as a 

785
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:25,224
female and so there's a debate to be had
and some empathy and understanding and 

786
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:33,510
you can physically change your sex.
You can remove your penis and surgically

787
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:37,730
implanted vagina and you can assume the 
identity of a female and you can be

788
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:42,750
born with a certain genitalia,
but it's kind of like in the middle.

789
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,073
What do you,
what do you mean,

790
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:48,030
like a peanut?
You can be both like an inverted u.

791
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:49,650
There are some people that are born with
both.

792
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,320
Oh yeah.
Or like stuff like that.

793
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:51,940
You know,

794
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,990
correct me if I'm wrong,
Dan,

795
00:43:52,991 --> 00:43:56,440
but wasn't Jamie Lee Curtis born with 
both a vagina and a penis?

796
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,210
I swear.
I swear,

797
00:43:58,211 --> 00:43:59,590
look it up.
I'll look it up.

798
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,750
Jamie Lee Curtis,
super famous.

799
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:03,490
Uh,
uh,

800
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,190
she was like a babe.
She was like one of the hottest babes in

801
00:44:06,191 --> 00:44:07,024
the 90s.
Let me make sure I'm saying her name 

802
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:10,810
right.
Yeah,

803
00:44:10,811 --> 00:44:12,550
that's her.
I think she was born,

804
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,540
uh,
with a,

805
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,910
with a both a penis and a vagina.

806
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,480
Uh,
that appears to just be an urban legend.

807
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,780
Are you kidding me?
Idiot.

808
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,243
Look again.
Double check that I just went to snopes 

809
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:29,320
and they're,
they're falsing it just flat out so that

810
00:44:29,321 --> 00:44:30,154
we fact check that I evidently,
there's a reason you thought that 

811
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:35,820
though.
Cause this is like a thing.

812
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,180
Uh,
but this is not true.

813
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,940
I had never,
why would people think that about her?

814
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:47,040
That's so rare.
Yeah.

815
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,070
Homer.
But is that a real thing then?

816
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:51,720
Because now I'm questioning if that's 
even,

817
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:52,591
yeah.
What,

818
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:55,080
what Ula was just describing.
Absolutely is a thing.

819
00:44:55,081 --> 00:44:56,550
Sometimes it,
you know,

820
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:01,220
when a baby is born it's,
it's sort of ambiguous and it's sort of,

821
00:45:01,221 --> 00:45:03,350
the doctor just kind of makes a call.
Um,

822
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,160
so that,
that is very low.

823
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,490
What does it mean?
A doctor just makes a call

824
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:12,180
literally that it can happen.

825
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:12,681
Wait,
no,

826
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:12,851
no,
no,

827
00:45:12,851 --> 00:45:13,684
no,
no,

828
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,021
no,
no.

829
00:45:14,021 --> 00:45:14,351
Wait,
wait,

830
00:45:14,351 --> 00:45:14,681
wait,
wait,

831
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:16,000
wait.
I got to understand this.

832
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,583
The doctor makes a call.
So is he doing something to the baby or 

833
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:23,634
is he just breading?
Male or female and the birth 

834
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:25,740
certificate.
The ladder.

835
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,910
And so what if the baby has a penis and 
he's written down as female?

836
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,793
I,

837
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,450
I mean,
I don't know the specifics of it,

838
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:35,500
but I do know that this is,
I mean,

839
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,320
obviously this is not super common.

840
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,573
Wait,
I'm just really actually curious about 

841
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:42,050
the metal.
Can you guys look into that period?

842
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:43,741
No,
I'm curious.

843
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,910
Let's look into that.
Um,

844
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,330
we're so sidetracked,
but I'm just fascinated by that.

845
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,463
So baby can be born with like either and
they cannot and the doctor can't tell 

846
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:54,210
the genitalia.

847
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,600
Intersexuality occurs whenever human 
being has both male and female physical,

848
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:04,230
correct characteristics.
Contrary to the main thing,

849
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:05,623
they do not have two sets of genitals.
They often have ambiguous genitals 

850
00:46:09,371 --> 00:46:10,204
structures.
Not readily identifiable was collectors 

851
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,510
or penis or,
so it's somewhere in the middle.

852
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,443
Why?
But that means that they have like a Ho 

853
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,220
like a vaginal,
like they have a vagina,

854
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:25,530
like an entrance and like a little penis
to,

855
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,230
does that mean they could actually fuck 
themselves?

856
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:29,790
No,
no,

857
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,301
no,
no,

858
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:31,001
no.
I don't know.

859
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:32,830
I don't know.
I know,

860
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,420
I know you're just curious,
but yeah.

861
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,240
Um,

862
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,890
I'm asking what people are thinking 
here.

863
00:46:36,891 --> 00:46:38,540
We're in pursuit of knowledge.

864
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,960
I just,
I don't know.

865
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:42,210
I'm still reading.
I don't want to,

866
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,730
I don't want to misrepresent this at 
all.

867
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,620
But anyway.

868
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,390
Well,
regardless of,

869
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:50,340
uh,
regardless,

870
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:50,971
Jamie Lee,
curtis,

871
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:51,804
he's not,
we have definitely cleared that one up 

872
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,000
so

873
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,760
damn by,
it can be like,

874
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,450
eh.
Well,

875
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:06,250
at any rate it says that you can go in 
and like people can go on a long periods

876
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:09,520
of their lives without knowing that they
were intersex

877
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,080
quiet and then they like grow out of it.

878
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,620
No,
just I think just when you're a kid,

879
00:47:14,621 --> 00:47:15,454
I mean,
you're not necessarily seeing other 

880
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,650
people.
You don't know that you're different.

881
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:19,240
I'm curious

882
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,030
to see what that looks like.
Obviously I can't show that.

883
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,050
Yeah,
no,

884
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,050
but I am curious.
But anyway,

885
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:28,640
that is,
why are you seeing pictures?

886
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,190
No,
I'm just trying to read about it.

887
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,610
But that's why the gender issue is like,
whoa.

888
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:34,960
Even though regardless of

889
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:35,770
that,
I,

890
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,420
that's such a stupid,
well,

891
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,040
people have been making these arguments 
for so long.

892
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:41,740
People have been saying it about 
homosexuality first they say,

893
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:42,843
Oh,
if two dudes can fuck each other or 

894
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:45,970
marry each other,
then what?

895
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:49,120
Then what can we start marrying animals?
Yeah,

896
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,060
that's,
well,

897
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,390
it's,
it's just so weak.

898
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:53,890
It's so lame.
Like Adam,

899
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,990
first of all,
animals cannot consent.

900
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,513
You know,
people,

901
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,980
people always ask me,
can vegans,

902
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,960
um,
take a,

903
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:04,760
can they,
can you come?

904
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:08,000
And the vegans mouth people are always 
asking you that.

905
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:10,370
People always ask me that.
No,

906
00:48:10,371 --> 00:48:12,390
I did get an email about that.
Um,

907
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:13,760
but I,
I would say,

908
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,100
yes,
you can come and a Vegan smells and I'll

909
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:16,934
tell you why.
Because a human can consent to give you 

910
00:48:19,551 --> 00:48:24,551
their semen and I assure you that it 
will be given with much pleasure if I,

911
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:25,883
my experience is any indication of that.
But animals cannot consent to give you 

912
00:48:30,261 --> 00:48:32,630
there.
Am I right Dan?

913
00:48:32,631 --> 00:48:33,740
Am I representing this rate?
You're,

914
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:34,700
you're a vegetarian.

915
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,500
Well yeah.
Animals cannot consent to,

916
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,633
um,
allowing you to kill them or I guess 

917
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,800
you're talking more about like dairy or 
eggs or something like that.

918
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:44,400
Uh,
yes.

919
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:44,900
Correct.

920
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,700
Right.
So,

921
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:50,700
so semen is Vegan if you have the 
consent of persons who you're sucking.

922
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,640
Yeah.
Right.

923
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,473
So,
um,

924
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,730
did you send me a link?
You want me to read this?

925
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:59,460
So back to that previous thing.
Um,

926
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:00,743
I just want to correct that.
It could look like a male or female 

927
00:49:04,471 --> 00:49:08,460
genitalia isn't look weird necessarily,
but you are homeless.

928
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,313
Could be,

929
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,163
Eh,

930
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:15,050
oh.
Like you could have the other hormones.

931
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:17,480
So sometimes that's the only during 
puberty.

932
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:18,373
Interesting.
You'll feel different than the gender 

933
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,670
that was given.

934
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:22,503
I'll show my screen,
I'm looking up in her s intersects 

935
00:49:24,321 --> 00:49:25,190
genitals.
Damn.

936
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:27,220
Okay man.

937
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,400
But they said that it happened actually 
a lot more than people realize.

938
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:36,600
One in 100 people in the u s want.
That's what I had heard too.

939
00:49:36,601 --> 00:49:39,060
I didn't want to say it just off the top
of my head and be wrong.

940
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:40,080
But yeah,
it's um,

941
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,190
it's much more common than

942
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,103
here's a picture of a,
I've typed intersects genitals and 

943
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:48,530
here's a picture of Jamie Lee Curtis.
I swear to God,

944
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:51,803
they're definitely appear.
I guess that was an urban legend that 

945
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:57,740
existed because many articles came up 
about it when I googled it.

946
00:49:57,741 --> 00:50:00,320
So I don't know how I'd never heard that
before.

947
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,110
It's just,

948
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:02,490
I heard that like,
as,

949
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,700
as like a fact.
False.

950
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,220
False.
Uh,

951
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,083
let's see here.

952
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,900
Yes.
Is She,

953
00:50:12,901 --> 00:50:14,430
she's a sheet.
But regardless,

954
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:19,431
I find that that argument very listen,
homosexuals,

955
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,680
transsexual,
there are people,

956
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:23,723
I just don't understand the whole,
this whole campaign of like trying to 

957
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:31,801
why our,
why,

958
00:50:31,801 --> 00:50:33,590
why are you even trying to contradict 
them?

959
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:37,130
Just let them live their live like,
you know what I mean?

960
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:41,750
Yeah.
I mean obviously some of them are pretty

961
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,480
aggressive and annoying.
Well,

962
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:46,190
there's extremes in that.
Exactly.

963
00:50:46,191 --> 00:50:48,320
You know,
but if someone's just like,

964
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:49,760
Hey,
I'm transgender,

965
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:53,120
I don't see that being an argument,
you know?

966
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,180
But again,
if this guy is doing it as a protest,

967
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,100
I think it's very,
very,

968
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:02,180
very weak because time is measured.
My Dude,

969
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:07,181
you have been on this earth for 69 years
and unless I missed a memo,

970
00:51:07,761 --> 00:51:10,870
we do not have time travel yet.
And so time as I know,

971
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:15,200
no it is not yet in dispute.
Sexuality however,

972
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,063
is somewhat of an abstract concept.
I know that there are male and female 

973
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:20,894
genitals,
so there is that concreteness of 

974
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:26,203
biological sex.
But I guess what the Trans people talk 

975
00:51:28,641 --> 00:51:30,560
about is gender,
which is,

976
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:32,930
which is different and,
and,

977
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,240
and like we just said,
I mean even the,

978
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:36,403
even the biological aspect isn't it?
I mean it definitely is a completely 

979
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:42,554
different beast.
So if he is trying to do this to make a 

980
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:45,651
point,
it's a,

981
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:48,050
it's a pretty weak argument.
So weak argument.

982
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,040
And also,

983
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,470
I mean,
dude,

984
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:54,303
just,
just fuck those old ladies to be like 

985
00:51:55,961 --> 00:51:56,970
Kyle,
Kyle,

986
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,980
Kyle,
the Cougar Champs got no problem,

987
00:51:59,981 --> 00:52:02,230
man.
He gets and he takes it for all of us.

988
00:52:02,231 --> 00:52:03,064
He's a young man and you are trying to 
lie on tinder about your age so you can 

989
00:52:06,071 --> 00:52:08,650
fuck some 49 year old,
cute little cuties,

990
00:52:08,651 --> 00:52:11,990
young cuties.
Hmm.

991
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:13,443
It's fucked up,
man.

992
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:17,080
It's fucked up.
It's just not right there.

993
00:52:17,081 --> 00:52:17,914
You have it.
They should be podcast spreading 

994
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:23,500
knowledge.
This is a wild story.

995
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:28,830
So this American missionary who's trying
to spread the word of God goes to a,

996
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,260
uh,
there's an island in a,

997
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:37,540
in India that is blocked off from all 
hue of humanity.

998
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:41,740
And this tribe has lived there in 
isolation for 55,000

999
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:42,574
years.
Some people estimate and the Indian 

1000
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:47,650
government protects this island because,
well,

1001
00:52:47,651 --> 00:52:48,484
first of all,
I think there's something beautiful 

1002
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:50,980
about,
um,

1003
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,820
they don't want any,
they don't wash.

1004
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:55,960
Yeah.
And,

1005
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:56,823
and I think there's something beautiful 
about conserving that and just letting 

1006
00:53:00,851 --> 00:53:02,440
them live in peace.
There's been,

1007
00:53:02,441 --> 00:53:06,190
people have attempted to go there and 
they've always reacted violently as,

1008
00:53:06,191 --> 00:53:08,140
I guess I was reading an article that,
um,

1009
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,293
the British,
a British went to the island early 

1010
00:53:13,721 --> 00:53:17,950
during their colonial days and like 
decimated the population of the island.

1011
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,784
And since then,
their original numbers have been 

1012
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:21,723
decimated and now they're still just a 
small fraction of what the population 

1013
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:27,330
was.
And they're very guarded,

1014
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,253
justifiably from outsiders.
And so this American missionary goes to 

1015
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,120
India.
Let me pull up this article.

1016
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,280
He writes that he's going there for 
tourism,

1017
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:43,281
but its real purpose is that he wants to
spread the message of Jesus and he knows

1018
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,220
is going against the law.
Preventing.

1019
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,210
Yes,
Indiana.

1020
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,740
Go there.
India prohibits,

1021
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:52,620
uh,
prohibits visitors,

1022
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,120
um,
and well,

1023
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:56,490
he was killed by the natives.
Yeah.

1024
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,060
Let me read.
Whoops.

1025
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:05,040
Um,
let's see here.

1026
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:13,070
John is said to have died and a hail of 
arrows as he set foot on North Sentinel,

1027
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:19,080
sentinel island,
part of the Indian controlled islands in

1028
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:19,914
the Bay of Bengal.
People live there or one of the few 

1029
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:22,314
tribes completely cut off from the rest 
of the world and have previously fired 

1030
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:25,794
at outsiders.
The media here is really incredible and 

1031
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:31,920
these people are fascinating.
Like here's someone off the coast,

1032
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,680
here's the,
um,

1033
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:37,610
the tribe.
Yeah.

1034
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,570
Like when they see people off the coast,
they stand guard on the beach.

1035
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,960
They're fucking cool.
It's amazing what a trip.

1036
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,700
It's like really?
Um,

1037
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:52,190
here's the island right here.
So really beautiful little cuddle land.

1038
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:56,060
Um,
this is incredible.

1039
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,420
55,000
years they've been there.

1040
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:04,970
Um,
Indian police confirm the death and said

1041
00:55:04,971 --> 00:55:07,010
local electronic engineers.
Simply,

1042
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,420
his name was Alexander.
Uh,

1043
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:15,430
he had locals and five fishermen took 
him out to the island illegally.

1044
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:24,360
Um,
he hired fishing a guys to get close and

1045
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:29,090
he kayaked to the island from the boat.
Here's some more footage of them.

1046
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,270
And this was like a known thing that 
they were hostile,

1047
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,320
prohibited by the Indian government.
They're known hot.

1048
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,630
Well,
the fishermen knew that too.

1049
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:42,300
And actually they're under arrest now.
Oh Wow.

1050
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,021
Oh,
right.

1051
00:55:43,021 --> 00:55:44,130
Cause I mean,
they broke the law,

1052
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:46,590
taking him there.
He was attacked by arrows.

1053
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,160
But continued walking,
but I'm not,

1054
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,800
the fisherman saw the tribals trying to 
rope.

1055
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,813
Oh my God.
The fisherman saw the tribals tying a 

1056
00:55:55,171 --> 00:55:57,540
rope around his neck and dragging his 
body.

1057
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,920
They were scared and fled,
but return next morning to find his body

1058
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:06,921
on the seashore fucking crazy.
Um,

1059
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:16,910
the people are banned from getting 
within three miles of the island.

1060
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:21,240
The island with an estimated population 
of between 40 and 200.

1061
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:23,590
Wow.
That's not a lot family.

1062
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:27,640
They used to be thousands of them and 
said to be at risk of death if they have

1063
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:28,474
contact with outsiders because they have
no immunity to common diseases like 

1064
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:31,834
fluent measles.
So this guy out there trying to give 

1065
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:34,650
them God.
Yeah.

1066
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,710
Trying to get my little tastes at Ge is 
us could actually end up,

1067
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,610
um,
decimating them out the final,

1068
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,600
I mean,
not a happy that guy died,

1069
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:44,580
but it's like,
yeah,

1070
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,330
you're God.
You got what?

1071
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,350
Well,
you know,

1072
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:50,350
I mean the guy went looking for Jesus 
and he found him.

1073
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,383
Okay.

1074
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,010
Yup.
May have taken all,

1075
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:57,990
he may have taken the whole veggies.
What he's like,

1076
00:56:57,991 --> 00:57:00,660
Hey,
he sees him in the afterlife is like,

1077
00:57:00,661 --> 00:57:01,620
Hey,
I saved you all.

1078
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:07,130
We made it.
We made it you guys.

1079
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,363
On the evening of 14 November,
the group of six pretending to be 

1080
00:57:12,741 --> 00:57:13,574
fishing evaded,
the patrolling police coast guard and 

1081
00:57:16,451 --> 00:57:17,284
navy ships reaching the island at 
midnight before Mr Chu Kayak to the 

1082
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:22,124
island in the morning,
please said the fishermen agreed a time 

1083
00:57:24,351 --> 00:57:26,120
and place to meet each other near the 
island.

1084
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,193
On the morning of 17th November,
they saw a dead person being buried at 

1085
00:57:30,891 --> 00:57:33,380
the shore,
which from the silhouette of the body,

1086
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:38,540
clothing and circumstance appeared to be
the body of John Allen Choo.

1087
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,280
This is an iconic photograph taken from 
a helicopter after the 2004 tsunami,

1088
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:46,583
which apparently a day somehow survive 
like this huge tsunami that this guy is 

1089
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:53,084
shooting a bow and Arrow at a helicopter
because they're just so unacquainted 

1090
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,550
with the outside world.
I can't imagine what they would think.

1091
00:58:01,551 --> 00:58:02,720
What would you even think?
Yeah,

1092
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,510
yeah.
Be Terrifying.

1093
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,530
Some gnarly bird,
rightly.

1094
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:09,783
MMM.

1095
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,070
In a situation like this too.
I mean,

1096
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,900
what,
what was the plan?

1097
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,040
I mean,
how are you going to,

1098
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,410
you can't just give them bibles,
they don't speak English,

1099
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,440
obviously wanting to explore and Tati he
could be the one guy that could reach to

1100
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:25,840
them.
So the thing about these missionaries,

1101
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:28,900
they believe that it comes from a good 
place,

1102
00:58:28,901 --> 00:58:29,734
even though it's insane as they think 
that the best thing you can do for 

1103
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:37,381
another person is give them Christianity
because they'll die.

1104
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,550
And internal torment trying to save.
He's just trying to save their soul.

1105
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,450
Right?
So to him,

1106
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:45,130
he's like,
this is like,

1107
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,730
I'm going to save these guys from an 
from eternal torment.

1108
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:50,410
They never even got the word of Jesus 
Christ.

1109
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:55,411
So how are they supposed to get saved?
And so he goes out there with the purest

1110
00:58:55,571 --> 00:58:57,670
of intentions.
But I mean,

1111
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,960
I will say for him at least he didn't 
fuck a kid.

1112
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:10,950
That's so bad joke.
So there is some thing nice to say about

1113
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:11,944
him after all.

1114
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,453
Mm.

1115
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:20,180
Um,
it's pretty wild story though going too.

1116
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,000
I mean he,
he clearly,

1117
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:25,530
he knew what he was getting stuff into 
cause he hired a black,

1118
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:27,570
a black market,
uh,

1119
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,820
illegal fishermen to write his ass there
and Kayak.

1120
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,710
And of course,
according to what I read,

1121
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,653
He,
there was hails of arrows coming at him 

1122
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,900
and he continued to walk with Bible in 
hand.

1123
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,470
It say that.
Yeah,

1124
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,800
it's it.
Do you want me to go back?

1125
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:46,470
I'll read that shit.
I think it's,

1126
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:47,990
and we're in those,
it's Santa.

1127
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,580
I'll read the hell out of that shit 
again.

1128
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,043
Okay.

1129
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,413
Mel Gibson could make a movie about this
guy and in the movie the natives are 

1130
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:05,180
Jews.
Of course I'm here.

1131
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:10,210
It says,
uh,

1132
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:18,410
he was attacked by Arrows but continued 
walking.

1133
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,510
The fishermen said it's pressing 
forward.

1134
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:24,340
Yeah,
a little brave heart moment.

1135
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:30,960
Um,
so there you have it pretty wild man.

1136
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:36,990
Z American.
He's American.

1137
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,840
Yes.
There you go.

1138
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:41,700
What do you think about that?
I mean,

1139
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,170
it says John loved people and he loved 
Jesus.

1140
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,890
It was willing to give his life to share
Jesus with the people in North Center.

1141
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:51,724
No island ever since high school.
And John wanted to go to that island to 

1142
01:00:58,081 --> 01:01:01,140
share Jesus with indigenous people

1143
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,160
or since high school.
So it was like a longterm project for,

1144
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:06,310
yeah,
I mean it's,

1145
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,740
again,
I know that was kind of terrible state,

1146
01:01:08,741 --> 01:01:10,640
but it's really hard to sympathize with 
this guy.

1147
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:11,523
It's like you knew,
you knew exactly what you were getting 

1148
01:01:15,221 --> 01:01:16,840
yourself into.
You know?

1149
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:18,873
That's an interesting story.
At what point it's like you can go to 

1150
01:01:22,571 --> 01:01:24,790
church and all that,
but at what point,

1151
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:27,940
at what point does a religion become 
insane?

1152
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,880
Like you can believe in the person is 
insane,

1153
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:39,420
but his defining characteristic is that 
he loved the God and that his whole life

1154
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:41,850
was to go,
it's a,

1155
01:01:41,851 --> 01:01:44,560
it seems like a suicide then a little 
bit.

1156
01:01:44,561 --> 01:01:47,950
Yeah.
It was a martyr,

1157
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:51,730
right?
It was a mood or you know,

1158
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,990
God loves martyrs,
so

1159
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,460
there you have it.
Like you said though,

1160
01:01:59,461 --> 01:02:01,740
I mean the point where it,
it drips into,

1161
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,880
yeah,
it's just fucked up,

1162
01:02:02,881 --> 01:02:03,714
is that there is the high likelihood 
that you're going to affect all these 

1163
01:02:06,721 --> 01:02:09,630
people with measles or smallpox or 
something and wipe them out.

1164
01:02:09,631 --> 01:02:10,650
It's like,
that's a nice,

1165
01:02:10,651 --> 01:02:11,760
you're kind of,
you're kind of,

1166
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,890
yeah,
you're kind of fucked up at that point.

1167
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,040
Well,
he's like my only,

1168
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,370
I just wanted to get them a bible now if
they all die,

1169
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,780
it's okay right there saying,
boy,

1170
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,780
I don't think so dude.
They're all safe.

1171
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:25,614
No,
I dug a little bit of arrogance little 

1172
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,120
bit,
but I feel bad for the guy.

1173
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:33,100
I wish them all the best in the 
afterlife.

1174
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:33,943
IOP is received well by God and that he 
says you did my work and you save those 

1175
01:02:38,261 --> 01:02:40,690
savages,
you know?

1176
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,010
I mean,
my God,

1177
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:47,700
they've got bows and arrows.
They need bibles and we need to get them

1178
01:02:47,801 --> 01:02:51,170
jobs so that they can pay their 15% tiff
teeth.

1179
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:53,710
How do you say that when the tight 
tight,

1180
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:57,880
but we need to get those savages pink 
tight right now because you know that,

1181
01:02:59,050 --> 01:02:59,883
okay

1182
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,370
God,
don't run on faith.

1183
01:03:02,371 --> 01:03:04,710
You run a money.
All right,

1184
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,633
what's next?

1185
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,540
Wow.
We got a lot of,

1186
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:10,880
a lot of windows open,
you know,

1187
01:03:10,881 --> 01:03:13,580
speaking of stories that I don't know 
how to feel about it too.

1188
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:18,581
There was another one 95 year old Nazi 
deported to Germany and I found this so,

1189
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:23,720
such a fascinating story because I one 
hand,

1190
01:03:23,721 --> 01:03:26,510
here's a shit head Nazi,
which we all,

1191
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:28,310
hey,
um,

1192
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:32,450
but he's like this 95 year old guy who's
being deported to Germany.

1193
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,440
He's lived here for 70 years.
He's 95 here is in the u s yeah,

1194
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,900
in the United States.
1949.

1195
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,620
Um,
and Germany doesn't want them either.

1196
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,590
They're like,
he's not a city.

1197
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:51,620
We don't fucking want this Nazi,
but he's so old and frail.

1198
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,770
Uh,
well let me watch the video.

1199
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:59,510
Do you ever night up in New York man,
officials are calling the last surviving

1200
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:03,290
Nazi great jacket.
Like he's 94 year old.

1201
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:05,540
Can't handle like her.
What the hell you could take out a,

1202
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,460
he could gas.
Did you at any minute and so weird.

1203
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:14,210
1949 hiding his past as an armed guard 
and don't think it was right.

1204
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,090
He was stripped of his citizenship years
ago,

1205
01:04:17,091 --> 01:04:19,580
but he remained here in the u s that is 
until now.

1206
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:21,920
[inaudible] Mary is here with a story.
Tara,

1207
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:23,240
good morning.
Good morning,

1208
01:04:23,241 --> 01:04:23,990
Paula.
Yeah,

1209
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:24,823
Paul.
He has been living in the shadows for 

1210
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:27,074
decades.
Amat Authority say is the last known 

1211
01:04:29,271 --> 01:04:32,780
surviving Nazi collaborator on US soil 
until now,

1212
01:04:32,781 --> 01:04:34,100
living in Queens,
New York.

1213
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,173
His presence,
they're bringing on year the outrage 

1214
01:04:36,531 --> 01:04:37,364
from the surrounding community,
but this morning he's been deported to 

1215
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:41,870
Germany at the direct order of president
trump.

1216
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:47,740
ABC News was there exclusively as ice 
agents wield no.

1217
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:49,940
At 95

1218
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:51,103
die like that's it.
Get the Germany and what you can't gave 

1219
01:04:54,761 --> 01:04:58,100
him and get on a plane at 95 I mean that
guy is going to not last long.

1220
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,720
Well,
Jeremy doesn't know what to do with them

1221
01:04:59,721 --> 01:05:00,554
either,
but I guess the premise is that he's a 

1222
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:03,194
Nazi and he doesn't even,
the guy deserves no dignity or comfort 

1223
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:07,820
or anything.
Right.

1224
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:08,653
That's,
I guess the premise they sent ice out 

1225
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:15,251
there for Christ's sake to wrap them up 
and throw him in a airplane.

1226
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:16,200
Well here.

1227
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,680
Oh,
so you a Nazi.

1228
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,690
You're watching him is on the case.
Five year old navy.

1229
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,800
Listen to Justin Bieber.
Is there,

1230
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:24,634
do you have any comment?
Do you have any comment on Ariana 

1231
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:30,130
Grande's breakup with a Pete,
Pete Davidson?

1232
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,090
Sir,
are you a Nazi?

1233
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,270
Yes sir.
Have you heard?

1234
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:37,961
Thank you.
Next,

1235
01:05:37,961 --> 01:05:42,961
do you have any comment sir?
Jerry Seinfeld is,

1236
01:05:46,711 --> 01:05:49,070
I'm one of the most rich Jews.
Have you seen his standup?

1237
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,750
Are you fan of Jerry Seinfeld?
Sir,

1238
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,730
can I get a,
can I get a remark?

1239
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,070
You don't believe it looks like he's 
dead,

1240
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:58,040
sir.
Sir.

1241
01:05:58,041 --> 01:06:00,080
Are you fan of Seinfeld and Larry?
David,

1242
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:01,970
have you seen Seinfeld the show,
sir?

1243
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:07,293
Love it.

1244
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:10,620
I mean,
it's obviously a theater.

1245
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:15,090
It's like a show cause nothing's really 
at stake here.

1246
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:18,690
It's just like a statement.
It's a statement.

1247
01:06:18,691 --> 01:06:20,250
It's a theatrical.
It's fair.

1248
01:06:20,251 --> 01:06:21,630
It's very much just for Shell.

1249
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,543
Okay.

1250
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,690
But what do you learn later in the 
stories that he was just a guard.

1251
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:31,720
I don't know what his involvement was 
necessarily an n and the execution of,

1252
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,900
of people during the Holocaust.
He was a guard at one of the death camps

1253
01:06:35,901 --> 01:06:36,734
though,
right?

1254
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:38,210
Yes,
he was.

1255
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:39,260
And He,
Oh yeah.

1256
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:41,210
Well here,
this story continues to explain,

1257
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,570
but the real question is,
um,

1258
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:48,030
what does he think about,
uh,

1259
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,040
the full house remains

1260
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:51,763
okay.

1261
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:57,340
It's finally being deported for his 
alleged role as an armed guard is a Nazi

1262
01:06:57,341 --> 01:07:00,700
death camp at the whole in decades after
his alleged involvement.

1263
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:01,983
I never regret,
sir.

1264
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:06,100
Do you have any regrets?
Justice Department investigators?

1265
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,740
Sure.
Have you seen the movie

1266
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,340
any regrets

1267
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:21,390
that's complicit in the deaths of 
thousands of Jews during World War Two?

1268
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:22,461
Authority?
Say Paul,

1269
01:07:22,461 --> 01:07:23,294
he lied to immigration officials when he
first entered the u s in 1949 and it 

1270
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:28,044
wasn't until 2003 that he was exposed as
an alleged war criminal and stripped of 

1271
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,380
his US citizenship.
Anything you'd like to say,

1272
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:36,630
sir?
Anything delete investigators.

1273
01:07:36,631 --> 01:07:37,350
Think right

1274
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:38,710
sir?
Have you seen frazier?

1275
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:42,360
Do you know that Fraser is run by Jews?
Do you have any remark?

1276
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:51,070
This footage is so weird.
Caring and willing.

1277
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:53,260
That one.
Then this,

1278
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,860
I'm confused about the straight jacket 
situation.

1279
01:07:55,861 --> 01:07:56,694
Yeah.
This tray Jack.

1280
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:59,820
I see a clear and eminent threat,
sir.

1281
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:08,663
And in 2004,

1282
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:10,780
what do you think about crusty being a 
juicer?

1283
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:15,790
Have you seen the Simpsons [inaudible] 
who was a Jew in the that yeah.

1284
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:18,380
His Dad was a rabbi.
I'm a deep,

1285
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,830
I got Simpson's Laura for days.
Okay.

1286
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:26,970
During a single nightmarish day in 
November,

1287
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:27,803
1943 all of the more than 6,000
prisoners of the Nazi camp that Yucky 

1288
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:34,830
Pauli had garden.
We're systematically butchered.

1289
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:40,130
A judge ordered him to port it in 2005 
but no country would take him for years.

1290
01:08:40,651 --> 01:08:43,110
Protestors gathered outside his home in 
Queens,

1291
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:44,183
demanding action.
Members of Congress imploring president 

1292
01:08:47,131 --> 01:08:47,964
trump to finish what was started to send
a message to the entire world that the 

1293
01:08:51,271 --> 01:08:54,270
United States stands firmly against 
antisemitism,

1294
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,830
bigotry,
and hatred.

1295
01:08:56,250 --> 01:09:00,030
The deportation drawing rare praise for 
trump from top democrats.

1296
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:01,343
War Criminal.
He didn't deserve to live in the United 

1297
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,133
States.
He doesn't deserve to die in the United 

1298
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,113
States place of freedom.
Mini quality where we respect each 

1299
01:09:09,001 --> 01:09:09,834
other's different

1300
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,150
sources.
Tell a B,

1301
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:15,270
c news.
The president became fixated on the case

1302
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,133
ordering his new ambassador to Germany,
Richard Grinnell to make polys and 

1303
01:09:18,931 --> 01:09:21,720
deportation a top priority.
After being sworn in.

1304
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,033
It's unclear what's next for him.
He's being detained by the German 

1305
01:09:25,051 --> 01:09:25,884
government,
but they're still evaluating as legal 

1306
01:09:26,971 --> 01:09:29,760
status since they don't consider him to 
be a German citizen.

1307
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:33,390
So deported overnight future to be 
determined in Germany.

1308
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,730
Exactly.
Hi everyone.

1309
01:09:35,731 --> 01:09:36,564
George.
Stephan,

1310
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:38,500
how about that?
Oh,

1311
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:41,180
it's a weird one.
It's a weird one.

1312
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,160
I mean he's a Nazi shit bag,
uh,

1313
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:47,000
clearly,
but he's also 95 years old.

1314
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:51,110
You know?
What would you do?

1315
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:51,531
Well,
I mean,

1316
01:09:51,531 --> 01:09:53,620
I don't know how to feel about it.
I'm [inaudible],

1317
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:54,703
I'm ambivalent.
I just don't see at this point what's 

1318
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:02,840
the point of doing this?
Yeah,

1319
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,470
they should just throw him in a hole.
I'm in prison.

1320
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,090
Hmm.
Sounds like you know,

1321
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:08,924
just the whole,
it sounds like since it took this long 

1322
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:14,060
for them to report him and Germany 
doesn't want him either.

1323
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:18,290
He basically is probably just going to 
spend the rest of his life in,

1324
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,540
in a camp.
Kind of ironic.

1325
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,340
Yeah.
That is kind of a beautiful thing.

1326
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:23,890
Let's put them in a camp.
I'm okay with it.

1327
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,850
You go make them watch a b movie for all
of eternity.

1328
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:33,760
Oh,
fate was Jerry Seinfeld presents to the,

1329
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:34,603
yeah,
but up everytime that speeds up every 

1330
01:10:35,901 --> 01:10:37,250
time it says be.
Yeah.

1331
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,350
Let's hop on over to fat submissions.
Guys,

1332
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:45,020
if you have submissions for us,
questions,

1333
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:46,280
videos,
suggestions,

1334
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:47,143
anything at all,
please drop us a 

1335
01:10:48,261 --> 01:10:49,094
line@podcastaththreehthreeproductions.com.
Today we have an email from Ma Meechi 

1336
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,840
guys,
big fan of the show.

1337
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,733
Oh,
this is,

1338
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:01,880
sorry,
I'm getting ahead of myself.

1339
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:05,580
You want to watch the CEO of Papa John.
Now let's go to this fancy finishes.

1340
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,333
Yeah.
Boy.

1341
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,473
Michi says,
I think Honestly Ping in the sink is a 

1342
01:11:11,061 --> 01:11:14,760
superior method than using a urinal.
Pros,

1343
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,640
you can save up to five liters of water 
because you don't have to flush.

1344
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,440
You can wash your hands while you're 
doing it.

1345
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,850
I don't understand.
Don't,

1346
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:23,070
don't you finish pain before you wash 
your hands.

1347
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:24,060
Otherwise,
what's the point?

1348
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:25,043
None of this makes sense.
Why are you washing your hands while 

1349
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:30,090
you're paying?
That's you're not done with the act.

1350
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,390
The sink doesn't.
Have you ever thought about,

1351
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,253
you haven't thought about this,
but I washed my hands before Ip cause I 

1352
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:38,610
don't want to get my dick dirty.

1353
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:41,960
Right.
Makes Sense.

1354
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,530
Because the Dick has kind of a holy,
it's my temple.

1355
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:51,690
It's a uh,
it's a quarantine down there.

1356
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:53,963
Uh,
the sink doesn't really get dirty 

1357
01:11:56,941 --> 01:11:57,774
because you are cleaning it up while 
you're paying literally impossible to 

1358
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:02,484
miss.
So you don't have to worry about 

1359
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:05,340
cleaning up or even putting toilet seat 
up.

1360
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,500
Splash it.
Just something that I'm concerned about.

1361
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,230
It says not cleaning it up,
but if you're paying in a sink,

1362
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:12,000
there's a little drops of urine all over
the place.

1363
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:14,520
Standing Upright.
Cons,

1364
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,070
you have to properly clean the sink once
a week.

1365
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:19,380
That's disgusting Bro.
Once a week,

1366
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,040
if somebody walks in on you,
you are going to get kicked out of their

1367
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:25,250
house.
Um,

1368
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,530
well I,
I disagree with the premise of peeing in

1369
01:12:28,531 --> 01:12:29,364
the sink,
but I found a subreddit called sync 

1370
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:35,100
pisters on know,
which is singularly,

1371
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:36,600
there's a whole subculture.

1372
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,673
Yeah.
It's a whole community dedicated to the 

1373
01:12:39,721 --> 01:12:43,710
glory of paying in a sink and from the 
sidebar that says,

1374
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,353
don't ask yourself what the world needs.
Ask yourself what makes you come alive 

1375
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:50,124
and go do that.
Because what the world needs is people 

1376
01:12:52,441 --> 01:12:53,274
who have come alive.
He was talking about pissing in the 

1377
01:12:56,131 --> 01:12:59,310
sink.
One P is sterile.

1378
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,413
Two sinks are unsterile.
Three people spit in the sink every day 

1379
01:13:04,141 --> 01:13:08,600
and occasionally vomit there.
I don't pee and my friend seek,

1380
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:12,890
I don't pee in the kitchen sink.
I run the water while Ip.

1381
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,650
Uh,
I never shit in the sink.

1382
01:13:16,651 --> 01:13:17,484
Well,
that's a good,

1383
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,670
I don't pee in the sink when they're a 
year olds nearby.

1384
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:24,510
I don't pee in the tub unless I'm 
showering in it.

1385
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,120
If I noticed that NEP has missed the 
drain,

1386
01:13:27,121 --> 01:13:29,540
I wipe it down.
Well,

1387
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:33,270
I right off the bat,
but the P is sterile thing.

1388
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,230
I'm believe that's bullshit.
I know that gets repeated on you.

1389
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:38,064
Look that up because I recently saw an 
article saying that p is not actually 

1390
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:44,640
sterile.
It's way PA's gross.

1391
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:45,421
Okay.
These gross,

1392
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,690
we can all agree with that.
Although I've seen some porns.

1393
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:49,524
Where do people don't think it's gross?
I'm sure you can find everything is not 

1394
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:58,740
stale.
Stale or stare.

1395
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,700
It could be stale I suppose,
but it's not sterile.

1396
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,210
I keep the water running after I finish 
peeing,

1397
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,810
peeing in the sink.
Although more readily accomplished,

1398
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:11,070
my mail is not in any way limited to the
mail.

1399
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:11,913
Sex.
Now here's one of the posts that I 

1400
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:16,000
looked at that really horrified me.
Okay.

1401
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:21,480
Which goes against the tenants of peaks.
If this goes against the tenants of sync

1402
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:22,683
peers,
and this is the fourth highest rated 

1403
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:26,343
post on the subreddit.
So God a different kind of mile high 

1404
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:31,084
club.
That dude is peeing in the sink and an 

1405
01:14:32,081 --> 01:14:36,550
airplane toilet right there.
This has gotta be ironic.

1406
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,770
Well,
this is people for real.

1407
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,870
I think it is for real.
Should,

1408
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:43,690
um,
although it's hard to say it because the

1409
01:14:43,691 --> 01:14:47,650
post under it says heavy breathing and 
it's a picture of a sink.

1410
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:49,263
Slash.
Gear.

1411
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:53,140
We were gang owned and see that one.
Yeah.

1412
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,490
Imagine pissing in the sink.
Piss her master race.

1413
01:14:57,491 --> 01:14:58,324
What is this?

1414
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,210
Imagine paying,
but you have to flush it.

1415
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:07,540
This meme was made by Cinque p gang.
All right,

1416
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,630
well there you have it.
So I,

1417
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,810
I think you should use a toilet,
dude.

1418
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,010
If you're asking me,
I think he should use the toilet.

1419
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,520
You know,
you may enjoy it and I'm,

1420
01:15:17,521 --> 01:15:19,750
I've peed in a sink before.
I'm not going to lie.

1421
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,600
Okay.
I've done it,

1422
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:24,940
but I don't,
I've not made that one.

1423
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:29,680
I think it was possibly that the which 
sink.

1424
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,680
I think it must have been first when I 
was a kid,

1425
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:37,390
just out of curiosity.
And then another time probably,

1426
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:40,510
I don't remember if it was with you,
Elo or different girlfriend,

1427
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,403
but we were both in the bathroom at a 
time and she was on the toilet and I 

1428
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:44,434
peed in the sink.

1429
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:48,720
It may have been with you.
You remember something like that?

1430
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:51,360
Yeah,
I think it was you.

1431
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:55,950
It was a long fucking time ago.
That must've been like so long ago now.

1432
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:58,080
Boy.
Like super drunk.

1433
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:59,280
Yeah.
I think we were drunk.

1434
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:02,400
I think it was like an art gallery and 
we were drinking wine or some shit.

1435
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,490
But regardless.
No,

1436
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:06,610
it wasn't at home.
No,

1437
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:10,470
we were drunk right off.
But the point is that yes,

1438
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,380
we weren't thinking right.
It's not like something we would do.

1439
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,050
No.
And I was,

1440
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:20,400
I cleaned up.
I didn't splash,

1441
01:16:20,401 --> 01:16:23,970
but I also,
I'm just saying a splash could happen.

1442
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,493
Splash does happen.
And all I'm saying is that why of it 

1443
01:16:29,141 --> 01:16:30,540
too.
At brush next to the sink.

1444
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:33,480
There was no toothbrushes next to the 
sink and Bob,

1445
01:16:33,481 --> 01:16:34,470
this guy.
Oh yeah,

1446
01:16:34,471 --> 01:16:36,270
no.
Well,

1447
01:16:36,271 --> 01:16:37,104
you know,
they say that there's poop particles 

1448
01:16:38,281 --> 01:16:40,800
found on most toothbrushing or you said,
I'm telling you,

1449
01:16:40,801 --> 01:16:41,580
look it up.
Damn.

1450
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:44,850
We're fact checking who particles found 
on most toothbrushes.

1451
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:50,250
But I think that life is complicated 
enough.

1452
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,880
You don't need to be paying and sinks 
looking over your shoulder.

1453
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,070
Try explaining that to a,
you know,

1454
01:16:56,071 --> 01:17:00,660
a new date or a family member or God 
forbid anyone.

1455
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:03,870
I mean the,
uh,

1456
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:06,300
the poop thing is verified and can looks
like.

1457
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,130
Thank you.
Who doesn't know their shit?

1458
01:17:08,131 --> 01:17:09,890
Now you,
me an excerpt,

1459
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,240
Dan.
Well,

1460
01:17:11,241 --> 01:17:15,350
it says I'm your toothbrush is home to 
plaque,

1461
01:17:15,351 --> 01:17:17,510
blood and even fecal matter.
Yes.

1462
01:17:17,511 --> 01:17:20,510
You're probably scrubbing poop particles
all over your pearly whites.

1463
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:25,690
There was a study in 2012 this,
this sink piss.

1464
01:17:25,691 --> 01:17:26,524
There's listening are like,
so that's the problem with is again the 

1465
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:30,043
sinker,
right?

1466
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:32,060
I say don't pee in the sink for Christ's
sake,

1467
01:17:32,061 --> 01:17:32,990
man.
Get your shit together.

1468
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:38,690
Chris Donahue,
what up h three fairly popular men style

1469
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:40,000
video,
uh,

1470
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:45,160
made a video about youtubers with Wac 
hairstyles and to no surprise.

1471
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:46,963
Thank you.
Ethan was one of the people he talked 

1472
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:53,570
about.
Here we go buckle up.

1473
01:17:53,571 --> 01:17:54,910
I'm ready to get pissed off.

1474
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:00,260
And last but certainly not least,
the fourth tip or the tear,

1475
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,060
I mean that with love,
but he looks like an Elf.

1476
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:05,580
Ears are a little pointed.
It's true.

1477
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,710
It's like the hair,
everything he's got going on.

1478
01:18:07,711 --> 01:18:09,000
He's very happy.
He's very elf.

1479
01:18:09,001 --> 01:18:13,770
Handsome health chic style.
It's the AIRINC still.

1480
01:18:13,771 --> 01:18:16,150
He's a little bit of a swashbuckler.
Okay.

1481
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,073
You know,
pirates wore gold earrings to pay for 

1482
01:18:21,061 --> 01:18:22,380
their funeral.
Is that real?

1483
01:18:22,381 --> 01:18:24,810
Dan?
Can we fact check that I'm on it.

1484
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:30,660
Linkedin has an all the fire.
It's a war gold earrings so that if they

1485
01:18:30,901 --> 01:18:32,640
died in combat,
they,

1486
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,560
Erin could be used to pay for their 
funeral.

1487
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,140
Is that fascinate you?
I did not hear that.

1488
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,253
Well,
I'm a wealth of knowledge and Dan is 

1489
01:18:42,521 --> 01:18:45,280
fact checking me as we speak meanwhile,

1490
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:50,010
but could be so much better is Mr.
Ethan Klein.

1491
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:54,270
Ethan has incredibly thick,
coarse curly hair.

1492
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:56,550
He's gone short.
He's gone long.

1493
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,820
He's gone.
Throw another one of those you'd Zippers

1494
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:04,850
that I absolutely love and it definitely
you're hitting needed more tlc then he's

1495
01:19:05,881 --> 01:19:07,420
coming.
Or Hot Dude like lists.

1496
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,880
Who wouldn't fuck the shell?
Legless the blonde.

1497
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:12,600
Yeah.
Isla you fucked the show.

1498
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:14,490
Like list.
Yeah,

1499
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,513
you would.
You know who legless is dating Katy 

1500
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:18,950
Perry.
Really?

1501
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,370
Wow.
It's getting some fucking premium.

1502
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,800
That's what I meant by Elf now that I 
found out you liked my content

1503
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:31,770
giving it.
Now the incredible thing about Ethan and

1504
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:35,080
his hair is so crazy because it's crazy 
curly.

1505
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:37,590
One of the problems with thick coarse 
currently

1506
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:38,683
bomb hairstylist.
I would totally hire him to be my 

1507
01:19:41,241 --> 01:19:42,074
hairstylist

1508
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,133
hair is that if you don't understand it,
if you don't nurture it and love it and 

1509
01:19:46,451 --> 01:19:50,170
get a hairstyle is that understands how 
to cut it and it can be a disaster,

1510
01:19:50,171 --> 01:19:53,500
but it could be better like this with 
the right product.

1511
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:54,943
Yeah.

1512
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,640
What's happening here?
What happened here,

1513
01:19:57,641 --> 01:19:58,474
Dan

1514
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,470
am I asked him,
Oh fuck,

1515
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,410
but certainly not least the fourth 
popular.

1516
01:20:03,411 --> 01:20:06,500
You could be better like this with the 
right problem.

1517
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,800
When you that Dan,

1518
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,620
what does it,
what the fuck is that shot?

1519
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,040
It's just the screen got super small.
Can you help me out here?

1520
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:17,760
I think so,
but how could he missed that?

1521
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,940
What the hell?
Youtube helped me out.

1522
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,570
That could be better like this with the 
right there.

1523
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,960
What is this?
Are you seeing Miss Dan?

1524
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,100
Yup.
I'm seeing it.

1525
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:32,880
Is it not just baked into his video and 
he just fucked up.

1526
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:34,930
I mean it's just so strange but okay.
Product,

1527
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,370
the right kind of,
that guy's got some hair.

1528
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,660
You think I can pull that look off 
field?

1529
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:44,770
I think you could buy your winner and 
take some work.

1530
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:47,440
That guy's got like wax in his hair.
You know what I mean?

1531
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,120
I do.
I draw the line at wax,

1532
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,760
but that's hot hair.
I mean,

1533
01:20:51,761 --> 01:20:53,950
that hair's fucking,
maybe it's just they rocket.

1534
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:58,030
I think it's just that he's very 
attractive and it looks like,

1535
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:03,160
it looks like someone just here will 
look good on that guy.

1536
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:10,080
That guy could have like pubic hair and 
looked pretty good.

1537
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,790
I want to fuck this guy's what I'm 
saying?

1538
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:15,460
This hair.
Come on dog.

1539
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:18,040
There's no way in hell I'm selling my 
hair like that.

1540
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:18,903
I mean,
I'm not knowing that he's got a fade in 

1541
01:21:21,881 --> 01:21:23,350
like a little pompadour curl.
I mean,

1542
01:21:23,351 --> 01:21:28,351
dude,
imagine a Chubby guy like me who dresses

1543
01:21:28,901 --> 01:21:33,040
in like elastic waist shorts,
walking out their haircut like that

1544
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,150
curly,
luscious locks of amazingness.

1545
01:21:36,151 --> 01:21:36,640
Come on,

1546
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,200
dude.
I am.

1547
01:21:38,201 --> 01:21:40,990
There's no way I'm styling my hair like 
that.

1548
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,760
What do you think?
You know,

1549
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:49,180
you like my hair the way it is.
Yeah.

1550
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,880
I like it longer.
Peewee Herman.

1551
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:53,823
Yeah,
girl,

1552
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,810
let's go jerk off in a movie theater

1553
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,433
like this.
You think I should go see a stylist who 

1554
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:01,223
understands curly hair?
He might need some type of relaxer or 

1555
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:04,883
Keratin treatment.
Just to take a little bit of the curl 

1556
01:22:07,201 --> 01:22:08,034
out of the hair.
It's going to relax the curl a little 

1557
01:22:09,661 --> 01:22:12,750
bit more in terms of product.
He could probably get away with the Pete

1558
01:22:12,751 --> 01:22:13,584
and Pedro Cream,
which is a leave in conditioner or the 

1559
01:22:15,301 --> 01:22:18,000
beat and Pedro paste that he's looking 
for a little bit more.

1560
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:18,800
Pedro.
Sure.

1561
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,810
This guy's,
this guy's

1562
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:24,250
pedro money.
Oh Wow.

1563
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,610
He calls it the question.
Everything he says he's brand new.

1564
01:22:27,611 --> 01:22:30,630
He's in their pocket.
You think it's his

1565
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:32,820
right and a little bit of shine.
Gentlemen,

1566
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:34,210
if you are not sure what

1567
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,220
well there you have it.
Um,

1568
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:41,030
I think you should go for it man.
Well,

1569
01:22:41,031 --> 01:22:43,070
I'm going to have to wait like a year 
before all your hair.

1570
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:43,610
Yeah,
that's true.

1571
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:45,380
As long again,
but when that happens,

1572
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:47,990
I'm going to ask.
Yeah,

1573
01:22:47,991 --> 01:22:50,300
boy.
For some Pete and Pedro,

1574
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:56,110
whenever it was he selling.
This one comes from James.

1575
01:22:58,190 --> 01:22:59,780
Hi,
my name is James.

1576
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:03,800
I'm from the UK and a level 10 vapor.
Dan will know what I mean.

1577
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,570
Am I little bit sick?
That's a high,

1578
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:07,660
that's a high level.
Is that good?

1579
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:09,600
Oh yeah.
And my local shop,

1580
01:23:09,601 --> 01:23:12,600
I found what I swear is a budget hunk 
version of Ethan.

1581
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:14,670
Maybe it's just me.
Let's see.

1582
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:19,383
Yeah,

1583
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:20,890
it's a vape juice.

1584
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,270
There it is.
Yeah.

1585
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,780
Oh definitely.
I was like,

1586
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:28,680
wait,
what happened over here?

1587
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:31,810
He continues.
Just thought you should know.

1588
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:32,644
It kind of tastes like shit.
There was a lemon and lime flavor 

1589
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:36,720
available.
Tilt.

1590
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,210
Keep doing what you're doing and 
congrats on the baby.

1591
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:44,550
It definitely looks like a budget.
It looks like animate and so me.

1592
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:47,003
Well you know what,
if you're going to use my likeness for 

1593
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:50,340
vape flavor,
at least make a nice one,

1594
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:52,800
you know?
Yeah.

1595
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:55,320
That's bogus that it's a terrible 
flavor.

1596
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,450
I wonder what it sells for on Black 
Friday.

1597
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:03,000
If I can get this one discount.
Probably always on discount.

1598
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,270
I'm going to try and track some down.
I want smoke.

1599
01:24:06,271 --> 01:24:07,170
You vape.
Yeah.

1600
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:11,370
So there you have it.
That is all we've got today.

1601
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:16,050
Um,
hope y'all have a wonderful Thanksgiving

1602
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:17,430
weekend.
I'll be all had a great thanksgiving.

1603
01:24:17,431 --> 01:24:18,840
Thanks for joining us here today.

1604
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:23,220
Next Friday.
We've got bill wirtz finally coming in.

1605
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,160
I'm super excited to have him.
Um,

1606
01:24:26,610 --> 01:24:27,510
Oh yeah,
Jack and Eric.

1607
01:24:27,511 --> 01:24:29,520
Is that the week after Dan?
I believe so.

1608
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,500
The boys are back in town the week after
that.

1609
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,150
I'm very excited.
A lot of time.

1610
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:37,350
And um,
I'm super excited to meet bill words.

1611
01:24:37,351 --> 01:24:40,980
I'm such a huge fan of all,
very high and he's such a mysterious guy

1612
01:24:40,981 --> 01:24:43,170
too.
Just so creative and interesting,

1613
01:24:43,171 --> 01:24:44,004
dude.
So if you have questions or anything 

1614
01:24:45,631 --> 01:24:46,464
you'd like to ask him,
or you want to tell me anything about 

1615
01:24:48,281 --> 01:24:49,770
them,
head on over to the sub reddit.

1616
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:53,340
There's a thread there where you can 
submit a lot of great questions in there

1617
01:24:53,341 --> 01:24:54,270
already too.
Awesome.

1618
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:56,520
That's great.
Thanks for participating in that.

1619
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:59,880
So make sure to tune in a week from 
today for Bill Wirtz.

1620
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:01,013
Meanwhile,
have an awesome weekend and we love Ya 

1621
01:25:04,241 --> 01:25:08,130
and wish you all the very fricken best.
Thanks for watching.

1622
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,353
Bye.
You.
