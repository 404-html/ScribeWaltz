How are you?
Good.

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,360
There was an episode of the Prophet 
where he helped a business of people who

17
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:07,230
were making,
you know,

18
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,730
cause that's funny.

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,640
And every time they said Gazyva I had to
giggle.

20
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:13,620
It's like I can't,
but so weird.

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,710
All of a sudden everybody's talking 
about the z boats like once.

22
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:17,544
When did you ever hear,
cause you beau used in a conversation 

23
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:21,090
ever.
I can't hear it.

24
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:24,600
We're not laughing now.
They literally made gazebos.

25
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,130
That was their company.
Yeah.

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,140
Um,
they read cool.

27
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:29,490
Good.
They were in the Gazebo zone.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,433
Yeah they were nice cause egos.
They were not your everyday a tlc cause 

29
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:38,070
he but let me tell you,
these were premium made guys.

30
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:40,290
Welcome everybody.
Thank you for joining us.

31
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,124
So wonderful to have you here.
I'm here joined by the illustrious a 

32
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,250
beautiful Isla Kline,
my,

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,850
my pregnant beautiful wife by the way I 
say pregnant,

34
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:51,684
beautiful wife because ever since we 
found out you're pregnant and we're 

35
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:57,084
always like all right,
you were still pregnant cause you 

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,433
because it's like kind of uneasy of 
during the first three months because 

37
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,150
you can have a miscarriage somewhat 
commonly like 10 to 15% I read.

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,510
But I just,
I think it's so amazing.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,780
You're so cool.
I always think to myself,

40
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,830
they say apparently there was already a 
heartbeat.

41
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,830
That's unbelievable.
And they say,

42
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,650
well,
this website we read,

43
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,760
they described the baby that she has as 
the size of a pip,

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,300
an orange seed and orange seed,
but they called it a pip,

45
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,790
which I thought was really funny.
Pipsqueak little pip,

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,730
but I just think it's so amazing that ul
has,

47
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,090
has this little pip and sober.
I don't know.

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,830
I just,
I'm so charmed by that.

49
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,070
I just think it's amazing.
And you've gained a little weight.

50
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:46,350
You've been eating great.
She's super healthy.

51
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:50,160
She's radiant,
and I'm already gaining weight and let's

52
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,200
see how much look at this.
I just,

53
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,443
I'm so in love with my beautiful 
pregnant wife who's got this little pit 

54
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,503
inside of her.
We've got our first ultrasound in like 

55
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,070
two weeks or week.

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,450
Oh wait.
Oh Shit.

57
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,990
Right?
Yeah.

58
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,650
I think it's 10 days.
I can't believe it.

59
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,990
It's still feels so surreal,
but yeah.

60
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,700
That's going to make it feel real.
Yeah,

61
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,860
sure.
There's your little pip.

62
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,980
We're trying to think of a name.
Maybe pip.

63
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,523
He Lazy.
Now go with your first instinct for 

64
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,740
sure.
Let's go for it.

65
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,210
Uh,
at any rate,

66
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:26,770
guys,
let's get into the show.

67
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm charmed to be here.
You're a,

68
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,340
let's get started right away with your 
goof of the day.

69
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:35,110
There's a lot to get to.
Um,

70
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,863
under the Gazebo here today.
Now this video comes courtesy of your 

71
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:41,494
boy Tom Segura.
I saw this on instagram and I had to 

72
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:45,604
share it with them.
So this is a professional boxer who is 

73
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:52,240
having a promoting a big fight he's 
having,

74
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,703
and I'm this,
I'm trying to break this down for you 

75
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,290
guys cause it's so,
it's so wild.

76
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,580
Okay,
let me show you the video.

77
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,013
So he's on a daytime television show on 
some mascot comes out dressed in a 

78
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:09,610
burrito and um,
I think he was meant to punch him in the

79
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,340
stomach cause you can see the whole 
space and like hit him right here.

80
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:14,290
Hit him right here.
And this box,

81
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,690
this is a boxer,
a world class fighter.

82
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,610
He punches this fucking guy in the face 
as hard as he can do it.

83
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,660
And you could tell that Burrito,
that Tortilla padding just isn't enough.

84
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,450
So let's see who is usually inside those
two.

85
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:32,810
It's totally like he's the guy,

86
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,830
not someone who can take a punch.
Apparently.

87
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,810
Apparently he broke

88
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,093
son of bitches jar and you see him 
writhing around in pain and everyone's 

89
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,450
kind of clowning on him.
But he,

90
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,700
he,
he's like trying to touch like yeah.

91
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,691
He's like,
dude,

92
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:56,524
I'm not okay.
Not everyone's clowning on him one more 

93
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,330
time.
Right in the stomach

94
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,740
fucking thing.
Oh cool.

95
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,363
So I just loved that the host,
he does pat the stomach and then last 

96
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,690
minute,
yeah,

97
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,430
I think it's his fault.
Really.

98
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,323
The host,
well I don't know if anyone speaks 

99
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:27,820
Spanish.
Maybe he was like punch him here.

100
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,480
Definitely don't punch him.
He just,

101
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,880
that poor guy.
He probably had like padding,

102
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:38,360
like extra padding on the stomach and 
nothing and oh my God,

103
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,370
this thin little tortilla layer.
So apparently he broke Shah and this guy

104
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,330
said on twitter,
I didn't know.

105
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:49,240
It sounds ironic,
his apology cause it kind give me a good

106
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,074
goal.
He said,

107
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,100
I sincerely apologize to the brave man 
that was injured.

108
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,870
I have the utmost respect for him.
His party,

109
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,750
he's talking about the guy in the brood 
is suit.

110
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,380
I have the utmost respect for the 
burrito boy.

111
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,750
Uh,
his participation,

112
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,220
willingness and courage.
He says true hero.

113
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,550
If this is true,
I would personally like to invite him to

114
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:15,000
my December 1st fight.
Yeah.

115
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,870
You see what you're trying to give this 
guy flashbacks because they have to,

116
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:22,850
where's Burrito costume?
I don't know why.

117
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,160
I just,
it had me in stitches,

118
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,600
frankly.
Uh,

119
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,850
he,
he tossed the beat.

120
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,980
He beat the salsa right out of the 
brewery.

121
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,310
Not a Mexican joke.
A burrito joke.

122
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,144
Let's be clear.
I've gotten way more class and 

123
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,500
integrity.
You can make a race related jokes about,

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,833
cause they put salsa and Burritos as 
well as rice and beans and stuff like 

125
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,730
that.
I thought that was not,

126
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,820
or do I need to make an apology?
Um,

127
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,520
here's another good one.
Yeah.

128
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,003
Okay.

129
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,140
Shannon,
your pieces here.

130
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,103
Okay.

131
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,010
Does just a goofy,
but we're just getting started here.

132
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,920
A lubing it up or lighten it up.
You know what I'm saying?

133
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,053
So this person decided to order a pizza 
and they put a sign on the door that 

134
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,350
said,
scream shannon,

135
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:16,350
your pizza is here.
Do not ring the doorbell or knock,

136
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,350
our grandma is sleeping upstairs cause 
you know,

137
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:22,860
I have to say,
what do you think about somebody leaving

138
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:26,730
a sign on a door for pizza delivery guy 
to scream?

139
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:28,200
Shannon,
your pizza's here.

140
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,300
No one would actually do that.
Yeah.

141
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:33,360
It's a kind of,
it's asking a lot of a pizza guy scream.

142
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,420
Most favor will probably not even read 
the letter.

143
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,920
It's not about asking someone to scream.
It's kind of like,

144
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:42,570
I'm not screaming.
Yeah.

145
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,370
You know what I mean?
But this guy,

146
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,683
he,
he receives the note and he 

147
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:50,760
reciprocates.
So what did the note say again?

148
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,410
It said script,
please scream.

149
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:53,244
Shannon,
your pizza's here because my grandma's 

150
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:56,760
sleeping and the doorbell.
We'll rake my Nana.

151
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,410
So let's see how this brilliant mind 
reacts to that.

152
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,220
And look at this guy strutting up like a
thousand pizza.

153
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,110
Like this guy's a pizza.
God,

154
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:10,890
if I've ever seen one,
he assesses the situation.

155
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,550
He strolls up with the confidence of a 
thousand food buzz,

156
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:15,420
a thousand pies.

157
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,690
I feel like there's no sound.
Yeah.

158
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,070
Okay.

159
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,970
There's no sound.
Oh,

160
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:22,850
well that's pretty critical.
Do you have?

161
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,741
Oh yeah,
I got it.

162
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:26,460
I'd mix it.
Let's try it again.

163
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,773
Here we go.

164
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,243
And here we go.
So foolish maximus of approaches the 

165
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:34,400
door,
pizza in hand,

166
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,020
the Crows,
the crows are crying and anticipation of

167
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:39,854
what's to come.

168
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,213
Thank you

169
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,000
Darren.
He screams in the faith.

170
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:53,834
Still not.
What I'm wondering is because asking a 

171
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:57,144
pizza boy to shout,
I am wondering if this was his way of 

172
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,400
being like fuck you for making me a 
shout.

173
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,980
It's a little bit of rebellion,
malicious compliance.

174
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,720
You know,
Nana woke the fuck up from that.

175
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,980
You know what I mean?
At second of all,

176
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:14,520
she opens a door and he continues to 
scream in her face.

177
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,354
So you know what I mean?
Like I wonder if it was a revenge cause 

178
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,760
who this guy really seize the 
opportunity.

179
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,300
You know,
I love that the crows are kind,

180
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,210
I don't think I've ever screamed.

181
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,413
It's like he took off

182
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,910
full breath.
Maybe this guy,

183
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,460
he was so passionate about pizza 
understands.

184
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,380
He's like,
they might be in the backyard and I'd be

185
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:47,610
in the attic.
They might be four.

186
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,620
I need these people to know that I'm 
here is so dedicated to it.

187
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,380
That's guy's a legend.
You're ready to,

188
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:57,690
exactly.
They've got some Mr Pib in the bag,

189
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:58,524
so that's,
these are people that respect pizza and 

190
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:01,614
soda because you don't order Mr Pib 
unless you're deep in it and what is 

191
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,480
that?
It's an off brown.

192
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,340
Dr Pepper.
Oh yeah.

193
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,363
Yes.

194
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,930
She's laughing.
Oh,

195
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,340
I want more.
I want the,

196
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,183
I want more.
I want to every Audi show that follows 

197
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:24,140
this guy delivering pizzas.
Foppish message that the TLC.

198
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,660
Oh my God,
it feels good.

199
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,030
Pick that up.
One day the screaming pizza man.

200
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,290
Tonight I'll tlc.
TLC is on fire.

201
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,690
Yeah.
Oh my God.

202
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,583
TLC is on fire because we've been making
all these videos about Tlc and how 

203
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:41,054
insane they are,
but I've never actually put on the 

204
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:45,020
network and washed.
I'm like,

205
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:47,000
well,
this is all amazing stuff.

206
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:51,080
Why am I not watching Tlc?
We started recording the channel.

207
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,830
Yeah,
I started,

208
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,380
I started saving on Dvr.
All the programs.

209
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,640
I've been watching 90 day fiance,
Holy Shit.

210
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,520
This is the best show on TV.
I'm swear to God.

211
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:03,320
This is the most entertaining show on 
television.

212
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,293
Um,
these guys will make a show about any 

213
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:09,464
goddamn thing.
They have like five shows about little 

214
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:16,841
people and giant people and giant people
and everyone in between.

215
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,403
I have this whole second,
but first I wanted to show this Tai 

216
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,670
Lopez is using me in a fucking ad.
You believe this guy amber,

217
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,250
we made that video with Tai Lopez.
Yeah,

218
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,130
here.
H three here in my garage with ty Lopez.

219
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,360
It's an ad.

220
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,510
Okay,

221
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,870
the fuck tie.
This is all the Muma layers.

222
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,250
I know.
He was good.

223
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,310
I knew he had an echo from his ads and 
now you're in his ass.

224
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,760
I don't think he's allowed to use our 
footage.

225
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,970
Like is he?
I Dunno.

226
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,150
I saw this this morning and I tweeted,
I deemed him on twitter.

227
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:58,631
I was like,
ty,

228
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:02,200
what the deal with the crying?
Laughing Emoji.

229
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,680
Really?
Because soften the blow a little.

230
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,520
Yeah,
soften the blow,

231
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,960
but give me a fucking break.
Doug.

232
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,400
What is it?
Shit.

233
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,610
Did he reply?
I Dunno.

234
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,660
I Dunno.
Shit.

235
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,603
Yeah.

236
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,530
And what the fuck tie.
Now you're using me to sell your shit.

237
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,910
I'm not.
I'm not even getting paid nine doors.

238
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,744
Singer message.
When we first saw his commercials on 

239
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:31,970
youtube like two years ago,
if someone told you this did I would one

240
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:33,880
day they had one or two,
believe it.

241
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,380
Not for a second.
Ila,

242
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,830
I guess there is some kind of beautiful 
poetry to to,

243
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,153
you know,
acknowledge in this that I'm sitting in 

244
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:48,560
a Lamborghini and a Tai Lopez ad.
It's pretty amazing.

245
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,120
Yeah,
that is pretty amazing.

246
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,450
Jesus tie.
What do you think in doing this?

247
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,840
We've got to get him on the phone or 
something.

248
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,953
So anyway,
I just wanted to point out that 

249
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:04,940
beautiful little thing that happened,
but I've got clips from 90 day fiance.

250
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:06,650
Okay.
So this show,

251
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:10,490
first of all,
I've got to tell you guys this show,

252
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,383
every episode is two hours long.
We just found out yesterday like this 

253
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:20,480
shit is so consumable.
We sat in bed,

254
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:23,900
the first episode we watched and we 
didn't even notice.

255
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:24,734
We thought it was 30 minutes.
It was just all of a sudden it was like 

256
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:28,310
1:30
AM and we're like,

257
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:30,260
whoa.
How did that happen?

258
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,050
By yesterday we were watching an 
episode.

259
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,210
Yeah.
And it's been forever.

260
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,160
And then it sounds like,
how long is this?

261
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:40,790
It feels like we've been sitting here 
for awhile and I was like,

262
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,590
I don't know,
40 minutes or something.

263
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,400
And we look and it's still all had been 
already watching for an hour and a half.

264
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,043
And we thought we were watching a 30 
minute show and didn't even notice our 

265
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,580
episodes.

266
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,610
Hmm.
Your tlc is like Las Vegas.

267
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:57,800
Like they hold you there,
you know,

268
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,930
in Vegas they like don't have lights or 
windows.

269
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,973
They like hold you hostage there and 
kind of like hide the fact that you've 

270
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,350
been hostage in their network for two 
hours.

271
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,243
And even the commercials are interesting
because they show all the other weird 

272
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,500
shows.
The Dev on til five,

273
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,560
lots of novasure yeah.
Oh yeah.

274
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,460
Self promote little people with giant 
people.

275
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,860
And you were just laughing and all of 
this.

276
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,450
So you were doing it.
We didn't even skip the commercials.

277
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:23,250
We really watched the whole two hours.
Right.

278
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,660
But um,
so 90 day fiance,

279
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:29,960
this show,
the whole premise is so insane and I,

280
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:31,370
and I,
and I stressed that.

281
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,204
I didn't even know how it's illegal 
because first it's usually starts with 

282
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:39,200
them overseas.
Well they have attorneys so it is legal,

283
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,430
whatever it is.
I Dunno.

284
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,443
Yeah,
they probably have some slick attorneys 

285
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,960
making sure that they're not getting 
deported.

286
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,393
But it starts overseas usually and then 
they're bringing over on some kind of 

287
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:53,264
visa and they have 90 days to decide if 
they want to get married because they 

288
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:58,910
have to decide the visa expires in 90 
days.

289
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,080
Right.
So they have to decide,

290
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:05,081
am I going to marry you and immigrate or
do I not like you and I'm leaving.

291
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,270
And the people,
well,

292
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,370
first of all,
the people that would subject themselves

293
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:12,530
to this already fucked in the head.
Right.

294
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,390
It's really weird.
I Dunno.

295
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,440
They're apparently somehow in love.
They met somehow.

296
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:19,310
That's how it usually is.

297
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,780
I mean like who?
No,

298
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:21,720
I mean,
first of all,

299
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:26,280
who would invite Tlc cameos and to their
relationship during this difficult time?

300
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,180
It's insane.
Okay.

301
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:28,740
First of all,
second of all,

302
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,850
the way they select couples is like 
incredible because they'll only,

303
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,350
they will specifically fine the people 
that,

304
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,273
and you look at them and you say there 
is no way that person cares about the 

305
00:15:41,761 --> 00:15:42,530
other person.
Yeah.

306
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,060
Cause like my favorite couple is this 
Guy David and Annie.

307
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,780
This Guy David is a 45 year old,
he's overweight,

308
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,360
he's broke,
he has no prospect,

309
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,223
no prospects in life.
And the girl was like 24 24 sometime we 

310
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:02,280
met and like,
and this is the reoccurring message.

311
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,820
There's no way to this other person 
cares.

312
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:07,430
So it's like,
it's so,

313
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,450
hmm.
It's so scan.

314
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,303
It's like so juicy.
I'm only now realizing that I love 

315
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:18,030
reality television because at first you 
were reacting.

316
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:19,170
You're like,
oh this is garbage.

317
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:21,750
Who watches a shit?
But when you put on Tlc all the sudden,

318
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:22,920
you know,
like this,

319
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:24,210
I cannot turn off.

320
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,593
Yes.

321
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,350
I don't know.
Last night,

322
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,480
yeah,
last night,

323
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,343
the episode that we watched,
which we're going to show some clips of 

324
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,430
it.
You got really depressing.

325
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,990
I don't know that I can keep watching 
it.

326
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:37,490
It's amazing.
I wasn't depressed.

327
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:38,324
I loved every second of it.
I was getting and like actually nervous 

328
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:41,960
for them and

329
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,800
you guys got to see this wall for me.
I was like,

330
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:47,660
Shit,
you thought you got marriage problems?

331
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,430
Tried dating David Thai massage.
This blew me out of my chair.

332
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,740
I said,
when I saw this,

333
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:04,860
I turned to gail and I says,
every moment of my life,

334
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,143
however difficult has been,
has it been worth it to watch this one 

335
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:13,590
moment on Tlc?
I've lived a full life.

336
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:14,424
I said after I saw this one clip and I 
was watching this live in the middle of 

337
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:19,830
a two hour episode,
I was blown away.

338
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,460
So this Guy David,
and this is ty fiance there move,

339
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:24,294
he's so broke,
he can't even afford to get his own 

340
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:28,704
place.
So there mooching off his best friend 

341
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,610
and staying in their house.
So in this clip,

342
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:33,480
his best friend,
it's like,

343
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:36,980
well what are you going to do for me 
that you guys are staying at our house?

344
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:40,170
And I'm telling you guys,
wow,

345
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,393
I love this.

346
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,323
I have to leave my country.
I have to leave my family for I go to 

347
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:49,410
Walmart,
then starting line with nothing,

348
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,600
no money,
no job.

349
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,610
But I believe in David.
I believe in him.

350
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,040
It's still beautiful.
I love this.

351
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,633
Tonight we're having drinks with Chris 
and Nikki before they hit back to 

352
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:05,144
America.

353
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,090
Amy,

354
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,420
when any and I get to America,
we will be living with Chris and Nikki.

355
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,940
It makes sense to the,
I don't have a car.

356
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,520
I don't have an apartment.
I don't have a house.

357
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,810
I don't even have a US bank account.

358
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,010
Why did he specify us?
Big cause he lives in Thailand.

359
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,710
At least he is a charming,
young and handsome.

360
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,490
Do you still have our house ready for 
you?

361
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,470
Are you excited about it

362
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,980
and exciting and scary?
Yeah,

363
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,883
we call it this very far from some of my
country and the very different 

364
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,830
everything.
So live lands Differenci Paul,

365
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,950
Chris invited David and Annie to come 
live with us.

366
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:55,690
Let's be clear.
This was not my idea at all.

367
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,970
And I tend to

368
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,810
to get excited and do things without,
um,

369
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,170
uh,
10 salting consulting.

370
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,983
So,
uh,

371
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,730
did you have some real estate you wanted
to talk about it?

372
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,380
Only being that I don't care.
I don't care.

373
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:15,240
Like our house is your house downstairs.
We'll share the kitchen.

374
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,980
Yeah.
Going bathroom,

375
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,200
you get your own little space,
you're welcome.

376
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,090
Um,
you know,

377
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:22,710
back on your feet,
you know.

378
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,250
Yeah.
Till we get situated there.

379
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:26,170
And obviously,
I mean even as we've talked about,

380
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:29,590
I mean it's a short term thing.
We have 90 days near your family to us,

381
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,813
my mind the whole time this guy is so 
he's the most pathetic person I've ever 

382
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,970
seen and I'm not,
I don't show the clip where,

383
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,523
but he's so broke and he's begging and 
mooching from everyone and everyone's 

384
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:44,401
like,
dude,

385
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:47,370
just get a job,
do anything.

386
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,650
And he's like,
it's just not that easy.

387
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,443
Ah,

388
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,550
crazy.

389
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:00,260
By days we can get through 90 days cause
we got just a little bit,

390
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,590
you know,
when you're on your 90 day visa,

391
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,990
you're not allowed to work.
But we would like you to,

392
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,180
you know,
maybe volunteer to do some things like,

393
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,560
you know,
volunteer to,

394
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,730
I know I like Thai food.
I would love you.

395
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,913
You love to cook.

396
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:17,850
Okay.

397
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,850
It's a little tight as we'd like it to 
volunteer to cook for us.

398
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,130
He,
but he's asking her to be a maid,

399
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,990
which is fine.
It's not,

400
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,600
I mean it's a little strange the way he 
puts it,

401
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,940
but guys,
buckle up.

402
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,640
I like to get massages.
I like Thai massage.

403
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:40,400
So is that something that you'd be cool 
to,

404
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,270
you know,
volunteered at,

405
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,350
give me a massage or something about the
pool or

406
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:51,610
I massaged by the holy fuck.
This thing is the one I just,

407
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,780
I'm still,
I was hooked.

408
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,180
This was when I was up my legs and when 
I gave up,

409
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,590
I can't,
well God,

410
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,610
I'm so worried for her.
This guy's such a creep,

411
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,750
but he says it in front of his wife,
who by the way has like a trillion miles

412
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:10,650
stare right now.
Like look her dead in the face.

413
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:14,050
You look in front of his best friend and
his wife.

414
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,080
Can I get a time massage by the 
volunteer for a massage I love.

415
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:20,920
He was like,
what is this charity?

416
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,360
Can you volunteer?
Just,

417
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,980
how do you wrap your head around that?
The guy's a creep.

418
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,533
I love how he's like your tie.
So Thai food and Thai massage and a 

419
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,144
happy ending.
Happy ending by the pool out this how 

420
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:40,750
you do it in Thailand,
right?

421
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,783
Yeah.

422
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,030
Look at his wife.
She is so checked out,

423
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,453
man.

424
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,520
Ah,
so here it goes on the board.

425
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,910
He doesn't say anything.
He's like,

426
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:01,810
yeah baby.
Come on.

427
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,650
Everyone's just looking at it as well.
Yeah.

428
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,241
I was like,
I said,

429
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:07,090
I'm not making you do anything.
I'm just saying it would be nice.

430
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,863
Oh,

431
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,410
it goes on because they cut it short and
I saw the whole episode.

432
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:14,244
He goes,
uh,

433
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,420
she actually said no thank God.
Yeah.

434
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,110
She said no,
but she,

435
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,530
uh,
but I would be worried.

436
00:22:19,531 --> 00:22:20,490
His friend was like,
oh,

437
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:22,890
well he told me that you give good 
massages.

438
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:24,870
That's why I ask like,
he,

439
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,191
uh,
his,

440
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:28,860
what's his fucking name of David?
Put her,

441
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,820
put his friend up to asking her.
That's crazy.

442
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:38,270
[inaudible] is that good shit or what?
Two hours,

443
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,430
two hour,
two hours.

444
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,100
Holy Shit,
man.

445
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,423
Do you,
do you have any skepticism that it's 

446
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:51,330
real?
Because like,

447
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,920
okay,
Dan Hour,

448
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,320
I ask myself all the time.
Yeah,

449
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:57,540
let me tell you this here,
right now.

450
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,210
I just don't accept that these people 
are good enough actors.

451
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:04,044
The pull it off.
Have you worked like just doing sketchy 

452
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,103
doing sketches for Rv?
It's very even a normal person that's 

453
00:23:09,981 --> 00:23:10,814
an,
that's been around performance in front 

454
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:12,894
of the camera.
It's very easy to tell when someone's 

455
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:15,370
acting.
Yeah.

456
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:20,450
I don't think that these are not even 
like also the action.

457
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,440
They followed them for a month.
Like,

458
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,970
yeah,
like a on faith.

459
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,320
How does that couple do?
We made a video about,

460
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,210
you can still see youtube,
a youtube channels.

461
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,510
I think if anything,
the producers probably,

462
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:35,344
you know,
instigate the manipulate and manipulate 

463
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,990
situations.
But um,

464
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,210
this is real as a heart attack,
dude,

465
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:47,360
this is real as a bowl of spicy my dog 
and it gave me a heart attack.

466
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,010
This is real.
As a happy ending.

467
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,490
Can you imagine when he started saying 
we would like you to volunteer?

468
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,570
I thought maybe they have a charity that
he wants her to come vulnerable.

469
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:03,404
You're at job.
He could just say maybe it'd be nice if 

470
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:13,760
you could just help around the house.
That's reasonable.

471
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,640
That would have been pretty normal.
He's like listen,

472
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,503
uh,
but he had to make it like all about 

473
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:19,274
like so your Thai Cook Thai food and uh,
I get me a fucking hand job every once 

474
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:23,504
in a while.

475
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,130
So amazing.
You guys.

476
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,030
Um,
here's another one.

477
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,770
So this is like af months later,
I guess his friend is kicking him out of

478
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:36,604
the house.

479
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,580
Okay.

480
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,010
Cause he's been freeloading there for so
fucking long.

481
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,283
Actually,
let me show the wedding dress one first 

482
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,783
told this guy is such a catch.
So here they are shopping for a wedding 

483
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:52,401
dress.
Okay.

484
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,234
They,
they moved to the u s or they're living 

485
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:57,200
with his friend.
Please.

486
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:58,290
For love.
I've,

487
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,260
I've picked out of 20 hours is a two 
hour episode.

488
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,750
These wonderful moments for us all to 
share together.

489
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:07,020
Okay.
Hmm.

490
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,250
Hello?
Yes.

491
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,220
Speakerphone.
Yeah,

492
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,230
I'm good.
I find the dress.

493
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:20,580
I literally lie it really.
Let me ask you,

494
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:22,050
I've,
I can't wait to see it,

495
00:25:22,051 --> 00:25:24,480
but let me ask you one of the most 
important question,

496
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,210
how much,
how much

497
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,673
this is a,
so you expect going to say like two 

498
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,363
thousand three thousand right?
Like,

499
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,560
and I obviously,
you know,

500
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,240
things are tight.
You can afford that,

501
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,673
right?
So

502
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,810
routine with everything,

503
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:53,010
300 for a wedding and dealt with our 
budget.

504
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:56,660
What do you expect her to where it's so 
cheap for a wedding dress?

505
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,820
Dollars.
Of course it says chipping.

506
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,663
You can find deals.
Like I loved that I was on commenting 

507
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:04,620
cheaper.
I love that.

508
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,780
She's like,
okay,

509
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:07,614
how much?
300 you cannot dress yourself for less 

510
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,910
money for a wedding.
And that pause baby,

511
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,560
you know our budgets,
$20 it's amazing baby.

512
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,060
I told you,
go to the thrift store,

513
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,550
did a dollar.
She calls him from the thrift store.

514
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,560
I found when I like,
it's 50 bucks,

515
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,520
baby,
come on,

516
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,130
you're killing me.
Amazing.

517
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:31,680
But it gets better.
It gets better.

518
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,490
I really want to just think about how 
many,

519
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,030
I want to say as much as I want you to 
say yes.

520
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,410
300 solar.

521
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,640
I can looking good audio won't just make
it work.

522
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:54,650
So now,
so anyway,

523
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:55,820
let me fast forward.
Okay.

524
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,610
When they're buying it.

525
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,880
So I don't know where to run it as the 
shit.

526
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,960
So they go to buy this $300 dress fay.

527
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:12,230
That's way out of their budget.
Yup.

528
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,880
It's a foreign car and we can't

529
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,700
yeah.
That the brand has to pay for it.

530
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,443
What do you do?
She's probably so sick of paying for 

531
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:31,860
their ship,
but what does it,

532
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,690
yeah,
thank you.

533
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,620
Yeah,
I just show,

534
00:27:38,621 --> 00:27:41,650
gives me,
cause that's so David,

535
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,633
I mean this is,
you cannot have a more awkward earning 

536
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,690
our money back out with David will not 
get a penny back again.

537
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,670
Yeah,
there we go.

538
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,910
Thank you so much.
Um,

539
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,390
so I'm burst and we cannot have what to 
dress man.

540
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,280
Oh yeah.
How was that?

541
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,850
That's feel you feel that up there?
It's pretty yikes.

542
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,920
It's pretty x guys,
by the way.

543
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,060
Give us a ring anytime.
Oh,

544
00:28:10,061 --> 00:28:11,350

Anything interesting here?

545
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,580
Uh,

546
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,720

Well,

547
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:18,280

I guess is old news stuff.

548
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,620
Eight oh eight hot meme.
Give us a ring.

549
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,530
Um,

550
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,270
Okay,
so finally guys,

551
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:29,104
and I don't want to stay on this for too
long because we have many of them leave 

552
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,743
to talk about,
but he later on visits with his sister 

553
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,770
after being on the verge of being kicked
out.

554
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,140
Thank you so much.
And He,

555
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,470
oh,
it's so amazing you guys.

556
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,400
I'm doing this.
I really appreciate it and hope you like

557
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:54,670
it.
I haven't been here in 13 years.

558
00:28:54,671 --> 00:28:57,160
I actually spent a long time does.
She was like,

559
00:28:57,161 --> 00:29:00,250
hey away to come to their leg.
Identical.

560
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:01,084
I want her to be there.
I really did see kids couldn't miss 

561
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:03,820
school.
I understood that.

562
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,160
So you've been here for a few months 
now.

563
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,110
Yeah.
How do you like being cured?

564
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,470
So stuff's hard.
The complaint on top of that,

565
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:13,110
now I have to pay rent for the 
firehouse,

566
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,540
which I was not expecting thousand 
dollars a month.

567
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,950
How are you paying all this off?
I am Nance.

568
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,640
I asked myself this every day.
Um,

569
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,480
tremendously worried for both of you.
What's the solution?

570
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,740
Dude?
There's nothing saved.

571
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,340
He's got an idea.
What are you going to do?

572
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,260
Well,
so that's maybe where I can ask you.

573
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,530
Oh Jesus,
Jesus,

574
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,570
I came all the way down here for you to 
ask me for money.

575
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,790
Ah,
this is painful.

576
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,740
Wherever you are in life,
whatever's going on,

577
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:54,640
man,
feel good.

578
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,823
You are whatever is going on.
You've got to be in a better position 

579
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:02,800
than this guy.
That's true.

580
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,933
That's true.

581
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,193
Fuck.

582
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,000
Love Him.
So there you go.

583
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,900
90.
So tlc is end summary.

584
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,270
The greatest place for entertainment on 
television today.

585
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,830
They have the most

586
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,690
creative and adventure.
I like to know,

587
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,370
I'd like to be a fly on the wall during 
the TLC executive like office who?

588
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:28,410
Green lights and red lights shows.
You know what I mean?

589
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,413
Cause they have the weirdest shit.
All their shows are about dwarfs or 

590
00:30:33,301 --> 00:30:37,500
giants or know what could be too weird 
for them.

591
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,630
Nothing's too weird.
But like,

592
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,520
I wonder what it is.
He's red lighting.

593
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,100
You know what I mean?
That's a good question.

594
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:46,350
I really acted reality.
I want to know.

595
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,720
I want a reality show about the TLC 
executive who green lights shows.

596
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,450
Yeah.
Um,

597
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,243
got it.
Cause the TLC executive today starring 

598
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,880
the TLC executive

599
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,513
women who are attracted to horses.
I married a mayor tonight on Tlc little 

600
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:16,360
people,
grave diggers.

601
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,630
It's about people that make little 
people coffins,

602
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,900
not about when they got to be in love 
with the car.

603
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:25,990
I don't know how to pitch something to 
wear and love with the coffin people,

604
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,320
little people that like having sex and 
little people,

605
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:32,530
coffins,
big wife,

606
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,263
little man.
It's about women that are over seven 

607
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:39,580
feet tall with men under five feet tall,
pretty close.

608
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:44,350
And they use their head as a builder.
They got a show called my giant white,

609
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,820
my giant wife,
dude.

610
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,253
TLC is,
you need to be watching Tlc all day of 

611
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:50,830
the week.
By the way,

612
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,700
this is just for my,
I love Washington.

613
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:54,250
This picture of Shaq and his girlfriend.

614
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,303
Okay.

615
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,560
They could make it,
they could be in a tlc show together.

616
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,410
It looks photoshop.
I sweat real.

617
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,880
I mean,
I think it's real dude.

618
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:03,770
Look up for,
I was,

619
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,910
I mean,
I've seen Shaq in prison.

620
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:07,890
He's enormous,
so like it makes sense,

621
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,090
but that's so absurd.
It looks fun.

622
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,221
I know,
I know.

623
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,440
I looked at so many,
I don't think it's photoshop.

624
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,303
I really didn't want to get gotten this.
But if I was at TLC executive about 

625
00:32:17,091 --> 00:32:17,970
greenlight,
this show,

626
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:19,990
I mean,
I,

627
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,300
you know what I'm thinking.
Right.

628
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,430
Okay.

629
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,230
How was she alive?
I mean,

630
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,830
his dick is probably the size of her 
whole fucking leg.

631
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:33,780
Yeah.
How does,

632
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,490
how do they have sex?
I mean,

633
00:32:35,491 --> 00:32:36,091
just,
I mean,

634
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:39,950
frankly speaking,
his foot is the size of whole body.

635
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,200
Look at it.
Look at the size of his,

636
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,100
I think it is real.
It's real.

637
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:44,120
I,
that's what I'm thinking.

638
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:49,121
I did my due diligence.
His foot is the size of her whole body.

639
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,643
Yeah.

640
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,890
She gives birth every time they have 
sex.

641
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,840
His Dick is like that big compared to 
her body.

642
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,350
Right.
I mean,

643
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:05,930
she's the size of his pants.
No given birth.

644
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,640
Joe,
look at the size of his pants.

645
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,090
She's the size of his pants,
of his shorts.

646
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,760
I can't get enough of this photo,
man.

647
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,110
Okay.
You,

648
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,943
um,
show underneath and there is another 

649
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,820
window.
Oh,

650
00:33:20,821 --> 00:33:22,890
you should got another,
a vantage point of it.

651
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,660
Yeah.
Look at these guys.

652
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:29,100
I mean that looks real.
I'm townie scales about the same.

653
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:29,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

654
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,810
She doesn't even have to like,
all right,

655
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:36,050
am I getting too graphic?
Maybe.

656
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,460
Here's a good,
this one's photoshop.

657
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:41,160
They think this is so confusing cause 
my,

658
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,750
Oh,
I can't turn your screen off.

659
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,510
All right.
Well when we come back,

660
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,060
um,
we got a lot to talk about.

661
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:51,030
We've got Kanye West is in Uganda.
We've got,

662
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,120
uh,
the shane finale to talk about.

663
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:54,954
We've got questions from our fans who we
love and so much more here and the 

664
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,970
Gazebo zone.
Do not go away.

665
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,433
Listen,
what's left to say about this vibrating 

666
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:09,920
tube.
Okay.

667
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,813
Now when I say vibrating Tube,
obviously I'm downplaying the 

668
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:13,694
significance that this is one of the 
greatest human advancements in the last 

669
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,430
two to 3000 years.
Yes.

670
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,880
More advanced than fire or anything NASA
has ever achieved.

671
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,893
This is the quip electric toothbrush.
This toothbrush is everything I've ever 

672
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,370
wanted in toothbrush.
First of all,

673
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,920
it vibrates superior brush.
Second of all,

674
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,450
it tells you when to switch quadrant.
So what you know how to get that perfect

675
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:37,730
two minute brush that dentists 
recommend.

676
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,810
Third,
the bristles are soft and heavenly.

677
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,863

fricking dollars.

681
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,030
A couple of old toothbrush electric 
versus how much is it going to run?

682

you know I talked about Lacroix previous

755
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,430
how the chemicals in it were safe for 
consumption.

756
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:45,040
But um,
the truth is that uh,

757
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:45,963
I don't know how to set this up.
I got this bit plant cause I've been 

758
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:53,740
working on my Alex Jones aggression,
but it felt really corny.

759
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:54,940
The weather.
Let me just do this.

760
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:56,590
Okay,
I got to Alex Jones.

761
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:58,540
Bet.
I've been working on your impression and

762
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:00,820
we've got this funny little thing,
so I'm just going to do it.

763
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,110
Okay,
so here's Ethan Jones.

764
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,483
Go ahead.
And so here we've got this green screen 

765
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:10,510
and Ian is going to hold that right up 
there.

766
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,813
Now last week,
Ethan Klein a liberal Jew out and spent 

767
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:19,020
too much time in Los Angeles talking 
about look,

768
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:22,260
Croix Beverages.
Now there is a chemical in lacroix.

769
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,573
Okay,
now bear with me here that when you 

770
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:31,080
drink turns the fricking frogs gay.
Okay?

771
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,750
Now you could believe he declined to 
liberal.

772
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:36,750
Who Says Lacroix?
Why is it some like funnel famous music?

773
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:43,010
Is this really the song we pick?
That's the one funnel.

774
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,070
Fancy bossfyte shit.
Now,

775
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,050
now,
now there's a chemical and lacroix,

776
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,330
okay.
That when you drink it,

777
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,283
okay.
And these liberals out here in 

778
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:57,820
California,
there David sipping the,

779
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,030
the blood of babies for too long,
okay?

780
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,043
And you've got these inner dimensional 
kind of feeds and they're zapping their 

781
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:04,740
brains and tell him that La Croix is 
okay.

782
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:06,450
But let me tell you the truth that bear 
with me here,

783
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,020
okay?
There is a chemical in lacroix that when

784
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:13,870
you drink your testosterone levels get 
so low,

785
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:17,490
think your penis actually gets sucked up
and pokes out of your butt hole,

786
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:18,090
okay?

787
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,820
Now the liberals want to take away your 
masculinity.

788
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,260
They want your debt poking backward at 
your butthole because they're cops,

789
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,000
they're liberals,
okay?

790
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,760
They're trying to demasculate you,
but you're a man.

791
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,150
That's why you take and for supplement,
okay?

792
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,280
And it may make you believe from your 
eyes,

793
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,500
but at least it gives you a rock hard 
cock,

794
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,080
okay?
So if you ask me,

795
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,530
if you ask me and I'll have my pressure 
is falling apart,

796
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,470
it's pretty good.
Now if you ask me Alex Jones,

797
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,580
it changes.
I don't know why I had it so down.

798
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:55,020
If you ask me Ethan Jones,
there's a chemical in this beverage that

799
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:55,854
will take,
make your Dick poke right out of your 

800
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:58,120
asshole.
Okay?

801
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,510
And so if you want to know how to get a 
rock hard erection,

802
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,910
how you doing back there?
Hold it.

803
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,953
You doing good in funny.
Poke your head out and say that it was 

804
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,680
going okay.
Thank you.

805
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:12,803
Hey,
I busted up now if you want a rock hard 

806
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:18,120
cock,
put the lacroix down.

807
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,100
Okay,
you're a little soy boy.

808
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:25,020
Put down the soil substitute and take 
info wars.

809
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,590
Black Rhino.
It's a supplement.

810
00:41:28,591 --> 00:41:31,560
We got it from China.
We have ground up black rhino husks.

811
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,560
You take,
you shoot that in your veins.

812
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,813
It is freebased via an injection.
And let me tell you the last time I 

813
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:40,640
injected this,
I had to go to the hospital.

814
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,010
They had to deflate the blood red or my 
Dick.

815
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,720
I fucked for 20 hours.
It's fucking off.

816
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,170
I did believe from my eyes.
That is a minor side effect.

817
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,320
So that's about it.
I mean,

818
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,830
you guys were flying by the thank you 
and we're done.

819
00:41:57,831 --> 00:41:59,510
We're finished.
We're flying by the,

820
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:01,790
the the,
what's the phrase?

821
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,610
Pants seat on our pants seat of your 
pants.

822
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,350
When does that mean?

823
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:12,260
I Dunno,
what do you think about Ethan Jones?

824
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,500
I like the special effects.
Yeah,

825
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:16,334
we're very,
the real life effect reminiscent of the 

826
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:20,050
original star wars.
Very practical,

827
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,340
practical,
very practical.

828
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,830
Um,
I hope everyone had,

829
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,753
had really enjoyed that.
And now let me tell you about Ethan 

830
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:28,604
client.
Okay.

831
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:34,270
This liberal Jew has openly admitted to 
v I don't really like that this way.

832
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:40,210
I think this liberal Jew has openly 
admitted to voting for Hillary Clinton,

833
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:46,340
who by the way has eaten at least 10 
babies in the basement of a pizza joint.

834
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:47,270
Okay,
that's true.

835
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:50,840
Now if you are going to pick up a 
lacroix,

836
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,733
you might as well eat a baby because 
that's what the liberals in Hollywood 

837
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,550
are doing.
Have you seen George Clooney?

838
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,250
He's 60 years old and he looks like he's
30 years old.

839
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,990
How does he achieve that?
Not by Jacob McCoy eating babies.

840
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:03,824
That's right.
Ila

841
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,103
[inaudible]

842
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,323
have you,
have you ever tried baby for skinny 

843
00:43:12,391 --> 00:43:13,570
yellow?
No.

844
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,400
Well that's your problem right there.
Okay.

845
00:43:15,401 --> 00:43:17,680
Because if you want to look like George 
Clooney at the age of 60,

846
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,633
you're going to need to inject baby for 
skin and Tier Gooch test the area 

847
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:25,270
between your asshole and vagina.
Very specific.

848
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,250
Okay.
Put down the Lacroix.

849
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,760
Let's turn to the fricking for obs gay.
All right,

850
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:32,870
I'm done.
Does anyone watch him?

851
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,340
Oh God,
we're trying stuff.

852
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:41,110
You know,
you might not think it's funny,

853
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,450
but it's under the Gazebos,
so we're free of cases.

854
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:47,530
I'm here today.
Okay.

855
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,803
Habif Kanye.
Now we talk about Kanye a lot on the 

856
00:43:53,851 --> 00:43:57,410
show because even specifically as a 
super fan,

857
00:43:57,411 --> 00:44:00,950
he's obsessed with Kanye and Kanye has 
been just been all over the news.

858
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,210
Yeah.
He's been all over the place,

859
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:05,090
so it's hard to pass up the opportunity.
Now,

860
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,680
Ian pointed all these things out to me 
and uh,

861
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,553
in,
you're going to have to help me 

862
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:11,630
supplement the information that we have 
here.

863
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,733
Uh,
now what's the background on this 

864
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:14,564
journal entry in a,
he showed this to the president of 

865
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:19,710
Uganda,
uh,

866
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,730
last week.
This is his to do list.

867
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,480
So he's in Uganda recording an album.
Right.

868
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,800
That's the best,
right?

869
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:28,940
That is correct.
Um,

870
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,163
so on his to,
this is just his to do list for the 15 

871
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,330
now on this is included,
um,

872
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,853
transformed zoos.
That's something you'd like to 

873
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:43,920
accomplish that out between three and 
four o'clock,

874
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,290
we'd then we knocked out transforms.
It was real quick.

875
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,990
Start wave runner sport.

876
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:50,980
Okay.

877
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:55,980
Make Electric drone at least for that 
week.

878
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,770
I love transformed zoos.
It's just like,

879
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,800
that was so 15th.
I'm on the 16th.

880
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:09,100
Babies' lives are different now.
Um,

881
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:14,320
what do you think about this list and do
you think this is an accomplishable list

882
00:45:14,321 --> 00:45:16,330
or has he bitten off more than he can 
chew?

883
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:21,100
Oh,
actually it says day 15,102,

884
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:22,030
I think.
Oh,

885
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,670
she's,
the amount of daisy's been alive,

886
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,593
I think.

887
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,460
Yeah.

888
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:31,900
What this guy on?
No,

889
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:35,590
that's not divided.
Well let's divide that.

890
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,513
It doesn't sound like enough date.
I don't think you crunched the numbers 

891
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,700
on this end.
15,000

892
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:42,520
divided by three 65 you're looking at,
no,

893
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,380
he's right.
He's 41 years old.

894
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,510
Hey Dan,
you put,

895
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,090
you put,
you sowed doubt in my mind about Ian's.

896
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,330
Never doubt when it comes to Konya.
I never,

897
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,223
never questioned.
So do you think he's bitten off more 

898
00:45:55,061 --> 00:45:57,880
than he can chew him?
What his column there it looks like.

899
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:03,230
Yeah.
And I mean I think the fourth one down,

900
00:46:05,381 --> 00:46:08,800
speak to George LucasLucas' wife.
I think very doable.

901
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:13,090
Accomplish accomplishment for him.
He'll definitely smart.

902
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:16,120
That one.
Also invite Wellsmith to record.

903
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:21,490
That's very doable.
I mean he just invites him transform.

904
00:46:21,491 --> 00:46:23,470
Zoos seems a little more complex than 
those,

905
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,140
but what do I know?
I'm not calling you with,

906
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,230
um,
we've got other things.

907
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:30,460
He,
he's in Uganda,

908
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,463
uh,
working on music and here he is passing 

909
00:46:35,681 --> 00:46:40,681
out yeezys to poverty stricken Uganda.
Ugandans.

910
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,070
Now the funny thing,
I had a couple of thoughts about this.

911
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:49,963
First of all,
these kids don't know what do they feed 

912
00:46:55,341 --> 00:46:56,960
their family with the,
you know what I mean?

913
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,110
And the second thought,
I had one pair though,

914
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:07,370
probably like a year salary.
I wonder if some guy,

915
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:08,263
some dudes with machetes are going to 
come club them over the head and still 

916
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:14,920
there easily.
So

917
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,920
it's like just his outfit.
It's so fun and like it's all Balenciaga

918
00:47:21,101 --> 00:47:24,550
and all this like high design or 
expensive designer clothes.

919
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,120
I don't know.
The whole thing is too funny.

920
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,373
I just,
that Kanye is response to like any 

921
00:47:31,871 --> 00:47:34,900
situation pass out easys like on talk 
shows.

922
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:35,734
Jimmy Kimmel came out and easy trump,
he gave a pair of yeezys Uganda yeezys 

923
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:41,434
for everybody.
And do you think this is a fair piece 

924
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:47,080
offering or was easy as not 
inappropriate gift?

925
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:48,543
He gave some to the president of Uganda 
to and he was like thanks for the 

926
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,170
sneakers.
So they don't,

927
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,820
they definitely don't know it.
Yeezys are,

928
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,053
I don't pay enough for the kids know the
president promised thanks for the 

929
00:47:58,931 --> 00:47:59,681
sneakers.
He's like,

930
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:00,790
why are you giving me shoes?

931
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,500
He's like,
thanks for the sneakers.

932
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:11,340
You dip also those as are so white 
that's not going to stay wide.

933
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,600
Not in Uganda.
I Dunno if that means,

934
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,850
I dunno.
They're just outside.

935
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,770
They're always starting.
Shit,

936
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,613
I don't leave the house.
I think in Uganda they're outside war 

937
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,753
it.
Do I need to apologize for that because 

938
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:28,120
that a racist a yes.
You know,

939
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,930
is it racist of me to assume that people
in Uganda are outside more?

940
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,210
It's grassy,
you know,

941
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,470
there's dirt dirty,
it's dirty.

942
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:40,690
It's dirty air and Uganda,
there's more dark there.

943
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,210
Is that racist?
Forgive me.

944
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:46,300
Do I need to apologize?
I apologize to all Ugandans.

945
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,400
It stared there.
It's dirty there,

946
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:49,234
right?
Yeah,

947
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,133
no comment.

948
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,193
Um,
so that was a joy to behold all these 

949
00:48:57,481 --> 00:49:01,360
kids.
No,

950
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,363
but seriously,
if there's someone in Uganda that knows 

951
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:07,710
the true value of those that you can 
resell it on Ebay for like 500 bucks.

952
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:10,560
Okay.

953
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,020
Aren't those kids are in danger,
right?

954
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,870
I mean,
am I wrong in back me up here?

955
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,633
Shaking his head?
No,

956
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,200
he doesn't think they're,
they have your back.

957
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,123
He doesn't.
Okay.

958
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,760
Ian Does.
Is Uganda Dirtier in general?

959
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,593
Back me up.
Yeah.

960
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,230
I've never been.
I Dunno.

961
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,750
All right.
All the pictures I've seen,

962
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:36,751
it looks quite beautiful.
I'm just saying there is campaigning and

963
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:41,560
I apologize to all the Ugandans.
I apologize for my ignorance statements.

964
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:46,220
It was actually my statement,
but you're kind of always handmade.

965
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,830
Fuck's wrong.
So backwards.

966
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,113
Um,

967
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,673
okay.

968
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:54,863
This one's wild.
He built like a whole dome city out in 

969
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,820
the middle of like a,
well,

970
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:00,654
why don't you tell me and you know,
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking 

971
00:50:01,951 --> 00:50:02,850
about.
Uh,

972
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,020
some national park

973
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,630
and he rented out.

974
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,180
Yeah.
Get some audio going with that.

975
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:15,620
He's having too much money.
Is there any other background you'd want

976
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:16,131
to share?
You in?

977
00:50:16,131 --> 00:50:20,950
You just kind of trailed off on,
he rented out a,

978
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:21,823
he rented out this entire lodge just for
him and his people and then he built 

979
00:50:26,271 --> 00:50:29,570
these like these dome things in,
uh,

980
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,880
in the middle of the wilderness.

981
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,093
Okay.

982
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,453
Very nice.

983
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,960
I feel like that's a really fun way to 
workshop your music.

984
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,820
You shouldn't record it cause it sounds 
really stupid.

985
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,550
But he's workshop again.
Oh,

986
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:04,930
you know what I mean?
It's just like some guy in the car.

987
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:11,354
He,
okay.

988
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,890
Yeah.
Carry on

989
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:22,800
the gas on a head on with banana.
Ah,

990
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,353
what the hatchet gave the kids some 
yeezys and they say it's easy common 

991
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,700
with Michelle and you get there.
Is that,

992
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,310
is that what you heard in or do you hear
genius?

993
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:42,680
Right.
It's a process.

994
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,800
It's a process that everyone on the 
Kanye forums listening closely,

995
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:52,700
like I dare you to say shit.
We know who you are now,

996
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:53,534
motherfucker.

997
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:54,883
Huh?

998
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:57,390
Some say yeezy,
yeezy,

999
00:51:57,391 --> 00:52:02,391
blueberry.
Others say scoping it.

1000
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,470
Goopy berry.
All right,

1001
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,790
stop Ethan.
That was pretty good.

1002
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,110
I think you should go to Uganda.
Dude.

1003
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,900
I don't have enough.
Easiest fast out,

1004
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,060
uh,
teddy fresh.

1005
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:16,270
They'll take any fresh.
Here's some new sandals.

1006
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,550
They're all dancing and she had the same
way.

1007
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,310
It's Uganda.
I apologize.

1008
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:24,970
It's Uganda.
It's a smaller buckets.

1009
00:52:24,971 --> 00:52:25,804
You've gone though.
I'm just saying I'm not insulting the 

1010
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:31,064
country of the people.
Those fuckers probably slip on like 10 

1011
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:38,260
cents a day.
Is that in salt?

1012
00:52:39,141 --> 00:52:40,400
Is that,
is that wrong?

1013
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:45,790
What's the daily salary of a Ugandan 
daily income of a gun?

1014
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:51,200
Ugandan.
I don't think we really need to.

1015
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,280
Um,
here,

1016
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:55,010
let's find out.
Annual income is,

1017
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:56,820
oh my God,
dude.

1018
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:02,000
What'd you got?
Monthly income for a household.

1019
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:07,090
A household that's a whole family is 280
bucks monthly.

1020
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,470
Yeah,
for a household.

1021
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,510
Yikes.
So what I'm saying,

1022
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,630
it's very poor country.
My sandals,

1023
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:16,520
my use sandals costs like 30 bucks.

1024
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:18,023
Okay.

1025
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,130
Just say played a poopy Doo.
He was like,

1026
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:22,990
move on.
Yeah,

1027
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,790
I'm sorry.
It is asking for the puppet.

1028
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:30,690
He's scoop Kanye out in Uganda,
which I will deliver to you now.

1029
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,950
This is the farm team.
Kanye daily.

1030
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:38,843
Ian,
are you following team Kanya daily on 

1031
00:53:41,461 --> 00:53:42,294
twitter.
I've got him.

1032
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,440
Yeah,
you're got them covered.

1033
00:53:43,441 --> 00:53:44,070
Okay,
good.

1034
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:44,903
Runs that account.

1035
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,010
This is fire,
right?

1036
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:53,080
All the animals in the jungle.

1037
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,073
He doesn't seem like he's good.
He's very serious about the scoop and 

1038
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,760
the whoop titties.
You know all the junk.

1039
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,653
This is like all the animals in the 
surrounding area because he's in the 

1040
00:54:11,141 --> 00:54:12,760
middle of the wilderness are like 
fleeing.

1041
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:14,983
They're gonna fucking,
it's like the elephants that looks 

1042
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:17,980
stampede.
A village cause stuff.

1043
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:18,943
Yeah,
they're just,

1044
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:24,090
they're heading for a highlander.
You get chills when you hear this again.

1045
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,533
As a fan,

1046
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,950
you have Chelsea in.

1047
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:39,600
Do you want to break?
Do you want to deconstruct the lyrics?

1048
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,303
I've got goosebumps.
Do you think he's just having fun or is 

1049
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:47,910
he really trying to workshop something?
I think he eats a bit about,

1050
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,050
yeah,
he's having a blast.

1051
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:50,460
He's been on the,
the scoop,

1052
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:54,180
the poop train for a while now.
I was just a recurring theme.

1053
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,710
I'm a fan of the scoop.
Did he poop?

1054
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,820
No question about it.
Um,

1055
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,790
we've heard a lot about you're scooping 
poop.

1056
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,353
Yeah,
it's definitely,

1057
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,020
you know,
Connie scopes the poop.

1058
00:55:07,021 --> 00:55:10,500
That was this incident.
Now he's a front wiper.

1059
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,160
Now we know for sure.
Connie is a fan of this show because one

1060
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:18,000
the purple hat and to his biggest hit of
the year poop scoop.

1061
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,660
Scoop the poop.
Okay.

1062
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,780
Um,
I've,

1063
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:31,340
I'm a fan of these creepy ass robots and
there's a lot more that came out.

1064
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:33,630
I want to show you guys,
um,

1065
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:38,300
this is called the Mat Hos Robot,
Aka the park core robot.

1066
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,070
Boldbock Boston dynamics of these 
motherfuckers.

1067
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:43,943
We're going to look back in 20 years.
We should have stopped them when we had 

1068
00:55:46,831 --> 00:55:48,570
the chance.
You know,

1069
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,201
like,
oh,

1070
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:51,390
everyone's laughing and it's trending on
Youtube.

1071
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:53,910
Boston dynamics.
We should have stopped them.

1072
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,830
Look at this robot.
Not even Matt Hos cut out pork or this.

1073
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,950
See Ya.
Hey,

1074
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:06,570
looks like a,
it looks like it's,

1075
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,673
uh,

1076
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:08,980
a computer rendering.

1077
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:09,590
Yeah,

1078
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:14,590
because he leaps so effortlessly.
This robot is jumping up blocks.

1079
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:23,260
I hate this robot is going to,
are you kidding me?

1080
00:56:23,261 --> 00:56:24,010
What chance do we

1081
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,910
have against these parkouring robots?
Like,

1082
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:30,100
are you fucking kidding me right now?
Like,

1083
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:35,700
stop them now.
You know what I'm saying?

1084
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:40,300
That can be used for good.
You know what good is a park Hong robot,

1085
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,340
except they chase you down.
You know?

1086
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:44,560
That's a good question.
Actually.

1087
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:48,370
The next video we'll show you what?
Good.

1088
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,530
Oh,
this is the good.

1089
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:52,840
Okay.
Elo Elo's correct of me.

1090
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:57,870
This is the good more bus.
You know,

1091
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:04,700
they're just trying to make it cute,
but this thing is fucking dead.

1092
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,970
He's dancing.
Okay.

1093
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,260
Is what it does over your corks.
Yeah,

1094
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,094
right,
exactly.

1095
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:19,110
He's dodging bullets right now.
Moonwalking I don't like it.

1096
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,580
Lasers are sipping Mai.
I don't like it.

1097
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:22,480
Yeah,
that's it.

1098
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,450
We should have stopped them.
And we had the chance.

1099
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,180
4 million views.
Everybody loves.

1100
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,960
Everyone's having a good time.
We should have intervene now.

1101
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,890
Little 12,
the robot dance.

1102
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,330
It's so funny.
No,

1103
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:49,080
this was our chance.
You know,

1104
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,000
terminator,
they sent Terminator and back in time

1105
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,680
to stop the inevitable before it 
happened.

1106
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,070
That's us now.
Okay.

1107
00:58:00,071 --> 00:58:00,904
Don't,
I'm afraid someone's actually going to 

1108
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:02,730
go do something to buff,
man.

1109
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:05,570
I'm joking.
For Christ's sake.

1110
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:08,640
I'm scared though.
And we must intervene.

1111
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:14,860
Give him easy's.
That'll chill them out.

1112
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,050
Um,
what else now,

1113
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,750
speaking of Gazebos,
these guys.

1114
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,540
Okay,
so a lot of comments.

1115
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:23,920
Let's,
let's go back to our new video.

1116
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:27,910
Okay.
Our new video was about the Tlc cat fish

1117
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:29,770
and this whole thing about gazebos and 
stuff.

1118
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,060
And the host of that show was,
um,

1119
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,081
God,
what's his full name?

1120
00:58:35,081 --> 00:58:36,310
I know his name,
Elliot,

1121
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,800
but I don't remember if Morgan Elliot 
Morgan.

1122
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:39,663
Um,
I hadn't met him once on the set of 

1123
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,433
smarsh.
I did a game show with him on smash and 

1124
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,293
I realized only about halfway through 
recording because he looks super 

1125
00:58:52,811 --> 00:58:54,920
different.
Like now he's got a beard.

1126
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,660
I was there,
him too,

1127
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,580
but I didn't realize it was him.
But,

1128
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:04,720
um,
at whatever you guys get it.

1129
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:06,040
But he,
he,

1130
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:06,874
uh,

1131
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:08,903
it looked like him,
but I didn't believe it was the same 

1132
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:13,000
person.
And,

1133
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:14,910
um,
but then you pointed it out,

1134
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,290
I was like,
doesn't it all look like Elliot?

1135
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,800
This is halfway through recording where 
he started the video and she's like,

1136
00:59:19,801 --> 00:59:21,350
no way.
And I was like,

1137
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:21,891
yeah,
you're right.

1138
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,750
There's no way,
but it looks so much like him.

1139
00:59:23,751 --> 00:59:24,584
It's kind of uncanny.
And then I look up the credits of the 

1140
00:59:26,811 --> 00:59:27,950
show and sure enough,
it's Elliot.

1141
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,900
Now a lot of people are like,
why didn't you mention,

1142
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,720
well,
I didn't want to,

1143
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,430
I didn't want to,
I didn't,

1144
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,490
I wasn't trying to personally attack the
guy.

1145
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:41,700
Yeah.
I thought it was best to not mention him

1146
00:59:41,701 --> 00:59:44,040
by name or even to acknowledge it 
because I didn't,

1147
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,830
I didn't want to give the Guy Shit,

1148
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,600
I don't want to fuck him up.
You know?

1149
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,360
We just make it fun to show,
I'm kind of the persona he was playing.

1150
00:59:52,361 --> 00:59:53,500
Yeah.
You know,

1151
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:56,980
it's probably not his show,
you know,

1152
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,120
so it's not really like,
yeah,

1153
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,700
he's project.
Yeah,

1154
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,350
I hope none.
And I'm just,

1155
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,080
I'm not leaving to go after people 
personally.

1156
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:05,600
I'm just,
yeah,

1157
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,630
that's not,
I'm just not trying to do that.

1158
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,320
And so we were trying to think like,
how do we,

1159
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:13,570
uh,
how do we address it?

1160
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:14,404
This,
that we've actually met this guy and I 

1161
01:00:16,331 --> 01:00:17,200
thought,
you know what,

1162
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:21,850
let's just not even mentioned this guy.
I don't,

1163
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:23,320
I'm not trying to fuck this guy's life 
up.

1164
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,413
But,
um,

1165
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,573
they fired back actually really funny 
video and I appreciate them so much 

1166
01:00:32,711 --> 01:00:34,630
because this is how you embrace it.
The meme,

1167
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:35,883
super funny guy,
the valley folk is that gets a sketch 

1168
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:40,480
comedy troupe.
Could you say,

1169
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,470
could you,
yeah.

1170
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:42,303
Could you,
uh,

1171
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:44,620
describe the former source fed people?
Oh,

1172
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:46,210
it's all of source fed guys.
Okay.

1173
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:48,040
So the valley,
the valley folks.

1174
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:52,830
So they made a sketch and response to 
that Ngozi Bros.

1175
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,673
So I thought we could enjoy it here 
today in honor of them embracing the 

1176
01:00:56,411 --> 01:01:00,960
main shut up to Elliot Morgan.
God bless him.

1177
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:05,733
Yeah.
Did you see the h three h d totally 

1178
01:01:07,561 --> 01:01:09,990
roasted Elliot's Tlc show?
Let me turn it up.

1179
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:10,883
So then again,
I haven't really ever hosted Elliot 

1180
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,830
Partial Shit.
Don't you start over again?

1181
01:01:16,831 --> 01:01:19,920
Because I talked over and I really watch
the youtube video in like 15 years.

1182
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:21,690
That sounds pretty good.
Thank you.

1183
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,833
Hello.
I am a 14 year old girl looking at 

1184
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:28,243
fraud.
Did you see you can make fun of Elliot 

1185
01:01:29,911 --> 01:01:32,250
for doing that really bad fish show.
Yeah,

1186
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,930
I did Joe.
That's why I'm in here.

1187
01:01:33,931 --> 01:01:36,900
I'm hiding from residual embarrassment.
Jokes aside,

1188
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:40,980
dude.
What kind of moron goes on a cap?

1189
01:01:40,981 --> 01:01:43,190
This show.
It's good company.

1190
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:52,290
I like Ariana Grande Day and coffee.
Dear Google,

1191
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:56,400
do actions have consequences or can I 
get away with Elliott Elliott?

1192
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:57,323
What's up?
Did you see that Ethan from h three h 

1193
01:01:58,501 --> 01:02:01,050
three roasted your ass on national 
internet?

1194
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:02,040
Well,
no,

1195
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:04,350
I didn't go.
You haven't seen it?

1196
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,360
I don't know if I want him.
Oh Man.

1197
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:07,343
Okay.
Um,

1198
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,230
get ready to,
I think he was probably,

1199
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:11,000
when he saw that I made a video about 
it,

1200
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:13,340
he was probably like,
like,

1201
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:14,780
oh fuck,
here we go.

1202
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:18,200
But I didn't want him to watch it and 
feel bad.

1203
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,034
That was my,
so I hope he didn't based on the 

1204
01:02:21,751 --> 01:02:24,660
response.
I mean they took it and uh,

1205
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:27,330
and I think they definitely made the 
best of it.

1206
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:28,164
I mean the video did really good and 
they made a really funny video response 

1207
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:31,434
to that.
Yeah.

1208
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:32,483
So there you go.

1209
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,690
And then also feel the cold tied to 
professional shame wash over your body.

1210
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:37,951
Okay,
Joe?

1211
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:38,784
Well here's the thing.
I mean Internet comments are just 

1212
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:41,664
manifestations of truths.
I came buried deep within for fear of 

1213
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:44,334
confronting them head on.
You don't need to act like you're a 

1214
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:48,210
predator.
You have a zip thing.

1215
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:49,680
He looks so much different.
Yeah.

1216
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,720
He's all shave.
He looks like

1217
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,500
so young,
like a suite.

1218
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,440
They styled him to be like this sweet 
young,

1219
01:02:56,441 --> 01:02:58,120
a Christian boy.
Yeah.

1220
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,283
They tried to dress style him.
So they're like this guy could never be 

1221
01:03:01,691 --> 01:03:02,524
considered to be a predator.
He's too sweet and good and too good of 

1222
01:03:05,441 --> 01:03:07,570
a good Christian old boy,
you know?

1223
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:08,920
Yeah.

1224
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,753
Bearded Elliott on the other hand 
definitely could never have hosted that 

1225
01:03:12,971 --> 01:03:13,804
show.
I'm kidding.

1226
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:19,440
I'm kidding.
Can I mention the most fucked up part of

1227
01:03:19,781 --> 01:03:21,580
this is it they're having her meet him 
at a

1228
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:26,460
good,
it's either this guy is fucking good.

1229
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:28,260
It's pretty fun.
What is pretty,

1230
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,460
pretty funny.
Yeah,

1231
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:32,340
it was,
how are you going to respond?

1232
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,630
A probably very stoically Joe and uh,
with a,

1233
01:03:35,631 --> 01:03:36,464
a dry sense of humor,
something that conveys authenticity but 

1234
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:41,040
it's also brand appropriate and most of 
all,

1235
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:45,870
most importantly tantamount.
I will not embarrass myself.

1236
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:53,893
Very reminiscent of Gamer goals.
What's the best way to respond to 

1237
01:03:57,081 --> 01:03:59,360
Internet ridicule?
And this is what I found.

1238
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:00,700
Oh,
revenge.

1239
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,400
Gay.
Yeah.

1240
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,470
I mean I don't want to get political,
but it's an option,

1241
01:04:03,471 --> 01:04:04,304
so,

1242
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,133
oh yeah.

1243
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:11,070
Well guess what?
Sometimes it looks like you kind of have

1244
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:13,860
a double chance and maybe work on that.
Got Him.

1245
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:15,780
Yeah,
yeah,

1246
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:17,510
yeah,

1247
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:19,120
yeah.
Anyway.

1248
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,210
Yay.
You get a gold watch.

1249
01:04:22,211 --> 01:04:24,520
They'll hold guys to go watch it and it 
is really fun.

1250
01:04:24,521 --> 01:04:25,570
And Yeah,
these guys are great.

1251
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,250
Very charming.
Very uh,

1252
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,540
very,
very good.

1253
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:30,820
Very nice.
The valley folk.

1254
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:33,370
So shout out to these food per troopers 
out there.

1255
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:34,983
May I may they join us under the Gazebo 
here today and all hold hands 

1256
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:42,070
delightfully under the Gazebo.
So shout out to all those guys.

1257
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,090
Very,
very sweet.

1258
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,900
Um,
no elliot's sweetheart.

1259
01:04:46,901 --> 01:04:49,570
I mean I only met him that one time.
Very sweet,

1260
01:04:49,571 --> 01:04:50,404
very nice guy.
Very happy to share the stage with the 

1261
01:04:52,091 --> 01:04:53,430
guy.
Um,

1262
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:55,030
and uh,
I wish him all the very,

1263
01:04:55,031 --> 01:04:56,200
very best.

1264
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,250
And uh,
I do,

1265
01:04:59,251 --> 01:05:00,890
I have some questions for him.
I wouldn't,

1266
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,810
maybe we should have a call cause one 
I'm curious,

1267
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:04,943
was that his clothes or did they make 
him wear that shirt with a zipper on it 

1268
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,810
too?
I'm wondering how much was stage.

1269
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:13,380
I'm afraid to ask though because I,
I don't,

1270
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:16,080
I'm afraid to find out it was all fake.
I don't,

1271
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:19,780
I must don't want to know that.
I don't know if we can't even tell you.

1272
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:22,960
That's curious and there's probably an 
NDA.

1273
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:28,360
TLC doesn't fuck around.
Um,

1274
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,280
maybe,
but again,

1275
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:31,114
this goes back to thing.
I don't think that that little girl in 

1276
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:37,150
those parents or can be that good of 
actors to convincingly act that,

1277
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,330
you know what I mean?
Well,

1278
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:40,243
the parents were okay.
I think the girl would convince me that 

1279
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:47,680
it's real.
If she was acting,

1280
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:50,380
she's got a bright future,
you know?

1281
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:51,603
Yeah.
But then that's also what I wonder is 

1282
01:05:53,531 --> 01:05:57,370
like if they're that good and they're 
trying to be actors,

1283
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:02,260
why don't we see these people in other 
things you don't?

1284
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:04,930
Yeah.
Conclusion.

1285
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:05,793
TLC is real.
Shout out to the valley folk out there 

1286
01:06:10,671 --> 01:06:13,260
and God bless.
Uh,

1287
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,410
here's a great one.
How's everyone doing today?

1288
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,120
Let me check the calls.
Anyone here?

1289
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,240
Grandmother passed away.
Wanted to thank you.

1290
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:24,700
Thank you.
I mean,

1291
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,270
hey,
thanks.

1292
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:29,980
That's the note.
Appreciate a pizza guy.

1293
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:32,463
How does this,
just trying to figure out how to do 

1294
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:39,400
these calls.
He's an air force high ranking officer.

1295
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:41,463
We've got a general on the line.
Wanted to ask about possible future 

1296
01:06:45,161 --> 01:06:48,130
guests for the show.
Okay,

1297
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:53,160
well thanks to everyone for holding.
I think that I will not take any calls.

1298
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:58,090
Sorry.
Um,

1299
01:06:58,510 --> 01:06:59,343
should I take this pizza guy?
He says had a similar experience as the 

1300
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:04,450
pizza guy.
How interesting.

1301
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:08,860
Can that be?
I'm not sure.

1302
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:14,550
Move on that air and think we need to 
give people instructions of what kind of

1303
01:07:14,981 --> 01:07:15,970
calls do you want.
Yeah.

1304
01:07:15,971 --> 01:07:18,280
I want them to be more topical.
You know,

1305
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:20,463
like we were talking about the creepy 
robot that has a park or robot ever 

1306
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:27,310
chased you down and murdered your 
family.

1307
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,113
Cause that happens every day.
Or someone who's got a question about 

1308
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:32,470
Kanye or something,
you know,

1309
01:07:32,471 --> 01:07:34,190
or some comment like that,
you know,

1310
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,720
expand on the conversation where we're 
having,

1311
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:41,820
you know,
um,

1312
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:43,853
yeah,

1313
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:49,680
we're working on it now.
Do you guys want to watch this?

1314
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:54,720
Watch this little twists here for you?
It was a great one.

1315
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:01,773
Yeah.

1316
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:15,070
I love this fucking guy.
Everyone clap.

1317
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:20,710
Yep.
This dude just take a fucking nap.

1318
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,153
MMM.

1319
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,550
What?
It's not even a play.

1320
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:27,640
Um,
I love that.

1321
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,320
I love trump.
He's good.

1322
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:31,120
He's really well read.
Anyway.

1323
01:08:31,121 --> 01:08:33,100
How Hitler?
Yup.

1324
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:38,410
He says it's so fast.
They didn't process it.

1325
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:39,581
He's like,
listen,

1326
01:08:39,581 --> 01:08:41,290
trump's great.
I've read his book.

1327
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:44,020
He's super intelligent.
I love his politics.

1328
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:45,490
I think he's great for the country.
Anyway,

1329
01:08:45,491 --> 01:08:47,900
Heil Hitler,
I love you.

1330
01:08:47,901 --> 01:08:50,530
Got To end.
Any point you make with that from now on

1331
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:53,500
anyway,
how Hitler but the audience,

1332
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:58,800
everyone in the audience is rocking.
This guy in the red takes a bite of it.

1333
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:05,440
Takes a bite of a sandwich on the Heil 
Hitler.

1334
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,150
Well,
actually this shit,

1335
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,880
damn,
that's a weird one.

1336
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:13,440
I,
uh,

1337
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,220
I'm a huge fan of,
uh,

1338
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:16,623
of trump's platform.
He's got a lot of smart things about 

1339
01:09:18,881 --> 01:09:20,680
immigration.
He's bringing jobs back.

1340
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:21,663
You know,
his tariffs I think are good for 

1341
01:09:22,601 --> 01:09:25,210
America.
Big Fan love America.

1342
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,370
God bless everyone.
And a High Hitler.

1343
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,050
Love your passion.
Love your enthusiasm.

1344
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,670
It's so anti.
It's so,

1345
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:46,150
you cannot be an American and a Nazi.
They are water in oil.

1346
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,213
Okay?
You cannot throw a Heil Hitler in 

1347
01:09:51,591 --> 01:09:54,080
America.
You just can't do it.

1348
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:59,350
I don't know your works in any country.
It works in some countries than Ohio.

1349
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:04,950
I've just saying America out in the 
public like that.

1350
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,920
That's a fair,
that's a fair point.

1351
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,130
You make a fair point.
You make a fair point.

1352
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:13,400
Heil Hitler.
You forgot the Heil Hitler at the end.

1353
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:16,250
Um,
read his book.

1354
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,350
Huge Fan.
He's a real intellectual.

1355
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:20,103
How Hitler,

1356
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:25,910
he's a d.
You're endorsing trump,

1357
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:30,460
not Hitler.
What does hillary could all this praise.

1358
01:10:30,461 --> 01:10:31,294
He's fucking gone.

1359
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,210
You know you're talking about trump.

1360
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,920
Hmm.
He likes it.

1361
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,650
He likes Hitler as well as trump.

1362
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:42,763
Hmm.

1363
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:46,830
Fascinating stuff.
Um,

1364
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:49,160
fat.
Oh this one is was really bad for me.

1365
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,353
Fat.
You guys know what a fat burger is 

1366
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,800
either on my whole,
unfortunately I do.

1367
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:56,343
So we've had an ongoing debate about 
baby wipes here on the show and I love 

1368
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:03,350
baby wipes.
I'm a huge proponent of baby wipes one.

1369
01:11:03,351 --> 01:11:04,184
Unfortunately this kind of started 
seeping into my reality that flushable 

1370
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:12,160
is misleading.
Yeah.

1371
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:15,900
Extremely misleading.
This here on during the podcast,

1372
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,680
it's been a hard truth to swallow.
Um,

1373
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,100
a lot of people were like,
Hey Ethan,

1374
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:22,020
I want you to know those are actually 
flushable.

1375
01:11:22,021 --> 01:11:22,590
And I'm like,
yeah,

1376
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:23,423
eat.
I was like suck my tiny Jewish dick and 

1377
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:28,910
I have stopped flashing them by.
You didn't,

1378
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,510
well I think that,

1379
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,833
okay,

1380
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:36,710
let me give you an anecdote.
I mean this morning I went white.

1381
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:37,603
What?
And there's a lot of shit on it cause I 

1382
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,740
got to do more dry them.
And then it seemed fine.

1383
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,840
It seemed ready to go,
but it wasn't,

1384
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:52,340
but it seems like when you go wet,
it is probably generally,

1385
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:55,820
you know,
less what's going on with this mic.

1386
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,670
God,
it's like all over the place.

1387
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:02,510
Um,
Jesus,

1388
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,460
when you wipe,
when you go wet,

1389
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:09,520
I have a feeling that's nicer maybe,
but when I go wet,

1390
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,450
it's fucking wild.
When you don't want that,

1391
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:15,860
you know,
we're gonna see,

1392
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:19,280
but you don't want a shit covered wet 
wipe of mine and the Trashcan,

1393
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:21,950
you have your own trashcan.
I'm telling you,

1394
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:24,250
you'll smell it.
Think so.

1395
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,270
We have separate bathrooms.
Um,

1396
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:32,453
but uh,
so apparently there's a phenomenon of 

1397
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:41,241
people flushing what wet wipes of raw 
sewage flushable quote unquote flushable

1398
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:47,691
wipes and hair turning into such a huge 
cluster of,

1399
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:54,570
of shit that it's actually clogging huge
city main pipelines.

1400
01:12:55,140 --> 01:13:00,120
So the danger is actually not to your 
home pipes,

1401
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:04,230
but the danger is to the city pipes.
Everyone.

1402
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:05,543
Yes.
And the city is spending millions of 

1403
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,970
dollars to take out these proverbial fat
burns.

1404
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
They're called that I'll share with you 
here today,

1405
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:16,770
but I don't know.
I mean,

1406
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,083
um,

1407
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,593
mmm.

1408
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,580
Chris,
Chris had the perfect rebuttal to when I

1409
01:13:25,581 --> 01:13:26,061
was like,
you know,

1410
01:13:26,061 --> 01:13:28,160
some people flush the baby wipes.
And he said,

1411
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,540
uh,
their shit on them.

1412
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:31,970
And I was like,
yeah,

1413
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,433
there's shit on them.
Why don't you just take a shit in the 

1414
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:36,510
trashcan?
Well,

1415
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:37,363
why didn't you open it up and show feels
law savoring the moment here developing 

1416
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,540
on developing here.
So the Charleston water,

1417
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:49,570
these guys have been on a tear lately.
This is the Charleston water system.

1418
01:13:49,731 --> 01:13:52,700
These guys are killing it on twitter 
verified and everything.

1419
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:54,953
Um,
they've been doing psa is about these 

1420
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,780
fucking Fatberg.
So here you go.

1421
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:03,860
Diverse swim these.
Now that's a hero.

1422
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,500
Forget about a mascot in a burrito 
getting punched.

1423
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,540
That's not courage.
That's not a hero.

1424
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:09,950
A hero is a die.
Well,

1425
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:11,950
maybe it is,
but I'm not going quantify courage,

1426
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:12,784
but diverse.
Swim through 90 feet of raw sewage to 

1427
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:17,794
unclog giant hairy Fatberg.
Can you fucking imagine you're diving 

1428
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,950
through raw sewage?
Damn,

1429
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,890
I can't see this.
You see that?

1430
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:30,724
Like,
that looks like something from a scary 

1431
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:35,440
movie.
Like an,

1432
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:38,620
like a monster.
It kind of looks like my profile.

1433
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:41,200
No,
no.

1434
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:42,890
Ken Hair.

1435
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:45,813
So this is just shit.
I find it intriguing that sewage turns 

1436
01:14:48,611 --> 01:14:52,210
black cause shit is brown obviously,
as we all know.

1437
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,560
What interesting.
So you want to take a bite of that?

1438
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:58,380
What'd you take a bite of that?
How much should they go about it?

1439
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:03,390
That I can barely look at it.
Just on the computer.

1440
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:07,480
It's spaghetti to marinaded spaghetti 
anyway.

1441
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,321
Yeah,
it's awful.

1442
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:09,154
It is awful.
So I stand corrected on the issue of 

1443
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:13,150
flushable baby wipes.
And by the way,

1444
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,043
I find it pretty wack that they can 
advertise it as flushable when it's 

1445
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:23,720
clearly a completely not flushable.
Yeah.

1446
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:27,850
Like literally not flushable.
How is that legal?

1447
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:30,453
I mean,
I find it to really be the fault of 

1448
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:33,514
these manufacturers that they're able to
get away with this deceptive marketing 

1449
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:38,960
because when I buy a flushed and we'll 
away,

1450
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:42,700
there's a whole market for flushable 
wipes.

1451
01:15:42,701 --> 01:15:45,640
I'm assuming that this is somehow,

1452
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:47,390
yeah,

1453
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:49,610
a valid statement.
You know,

1454
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:51,730
it's crazy.
I can't believe,

1455
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,593
I dunno.
I find that to be some kind of false 

1456
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,540
advertising.
Um,

1457
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:56,443
there's,
there's so much more Fatberg they're 

1458
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,930
called,
which is a great,

1459
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:01,780
lovely name.
Um,

1460
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:08,260
hope you guys are hungry.
Look at,

1461
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:12,874
this is the brave fuck that goes in 
dives and still raw sewage and wonder 

1462
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:19,990
what those guys get paid man.
Dot Picture.

1463
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:20,951
Um,
move.

1464
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,810
Right?
Like that's a whole,

1465
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:28,080
it looks like this crazy fuck.
He's not even wearing protection.

1466
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:30,120
His sleeves are out.

1467
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:31,463
Okay.

1468
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:37,290
He's proposing with the Fab Berg,
his arms are exposed,

1469
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:43,870
his face is exposed.
That's courage.

1470
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:50,860
It's pretty to that guy is.
So yeah,

1471
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,320
this is like a crazy operation.
Then look good.

1472
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:55,930
I look at all the work they do too.
They says,

1473
01:16:55,931 --> 01:16:59,260
do you use flushable wipes in your home?
Turns out they're not so flushable after

1474
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:00,071
all,
in fact,

1475
01:17:00,071 --> 01:17:04,300
they just caused a major citywide,
a water pump clog and Charleston,

1476
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,440
Charleston water says is becoming a huge
issue for them too.

1477
01:17:08,441 --> 01:17:11,690
We break it down tonight.
Oh Wow.

1478
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:13,730
There's a whole investigation going on.

1479
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,470
Okay,

1480
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:20,910
so what are you going to do about it?
I think I'm going to get some bad days.

1481
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,290
I think I'm going to get the days 
installed.

1482
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,790
I really liked these photos.
These are these crazy ones.

1483
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:30,570
We tried it when we were in Montreal,
but I had diarrhea.

1484
01:17:30,571 --> 01:17:32,130
So my,
I don't know if I talked about this,

1485
01:17:32,131 --> 01:17:32,964
I have like really crazy diarrhea.
And so my asshole was super sore from 

1486
01:17:36,421 --> 01:17:40,490
wiping so vigorously.
And so when I shot the water,

1487
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:41,343
my asshole to her,
cause I'd look open wounds so I didn't 

1488
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:47,040
get to enjoy it that much.
And then when I,

1489
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,870
cause it's like a communal toilet.
It has a fan setting.

1490
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:54,270
So it's um,
oh,

1491
01:17:54,271 --> 01:17:55,680
it has a dryer.
First of all,

1492
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,180
it has a fan.
So when you sit on it,

1493
01:17:57,190 --> 01:18:01,920
it's sucks in the air.
It's sucks the shit smell out of there.

1494
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:05,710
I swear to,
I swear to you right now and then,

1495
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,910
but the weird thing,
so it's sprays your asshole.

1496
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:12,700
And then the problem that I had with it,
frankly speaking,

1497
01:18:12,701 --> 01:18:14,170
because everyone talks about these big 
days,

1498
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,520
like they're,
you know,

1499
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:19,110
heaven sent and this is a,
this is what I fear what happened,

1500
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:19,944
but water dripped down my balls.
Shitty water was dripping down my balls 

1501
01:18:23,431 --> 01:18:24,450
for for fuck sake.

1502
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,513
Hmm.

1503
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,520
Torn.
Probably need to learn how to use it.

1504
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:29,443
You know,
how do I avoid water shooting down my 

1505
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:33,530
ball and take some learning.
Okay.

1506
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:36,350
I'm willing to learn.
But the weird one for me,

1507
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,230
because this isn't a hotel so this has 
had a lot of people shit.

1508
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,080
Um,
the seat was warm.

1509
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:44,960
Love that the seat comes up when you 
approach it.

1510
01:18:44,961 --> 01:18:48,350
Love that.
But then they have a dryer setting cause

1511
01:18:48,351 --> 01:18:49,184
they know that your balls are all wet 
and your asshole and everything's all 

1512
01:18:50,721 --> 01:18:51,554
wet.
And then the dryer smelled like it was 

1513
01:18:54,141 --> 01:18:55,270
blowing shitty.
Aaron,

1514
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:59,300
my face.
That sounds gross and like not,

1515
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:00,870
why did you have your face in the toilet
bowl?

1516
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:06,500
I didn't damn it smelled like I needed 
a,

1517
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,010
I needed some fresh squirt water on my 
face.

1518
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,910
It's a little pick me up.
But though,

1519
01:19:14,911 --> 01:19:15,744
so it wasn't like my shit smell though.
It was like this shit smell of like 

1520
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,400
thousands before me.

1521
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:22,150
Oh yeah.

1522
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:24,900
In that hotel.
So it's billowing like shitty air.

1523
01:19:24,901 --> 01:19:27,630
Like Fatberg air goes.
Yeah.

1524
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,393
So that I had a problem with but,
but I think I'm going to go the 

1525
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:34,663
[inaudible].
I feel like we are responsible probably 

1526
01:19:36,811 --> 01:19:37,644
for telling a lot of people to use baby 
wipes brought with the amount of baby 

1527
01:19:40,701 --> 01:19:41,401
wipes.
I flush.

1528
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:42,234
I'm personally responsible for 
destroying the septic system ups of all 

1529
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:45,714
of Israel and Los Angeles and New York.
So I take it back and say that I do not 

1530
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:53,003
use them anymore.
We're moving the endorsement of 

1531
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:57,210
flushable so called flushable baby 
wipes.

1532
01:19:57,810 --> 01:19:59,520
Yeah.
And um,

1533
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,200
I'm going to,
I think I'm going to go the bid day rope

1534
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:07,230
the toe toes to try it.

1535
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,960
I mean,
even the thing that I always,

1536
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,920
I love this thought,
the King of England.

1537
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,100
How did he wipe his ass?
You know what I'm saying?

1538
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,433
Like back in the day when the king was 
like God and he's got like literally 

1539
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:28,410
gold woven dresses that he like lifts up
and shits,

1540
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,260
does someone wipe his ass?
You know what I mean?

1541
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:35,760
I don't think so.
You think that king gods gods,

1542
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:37,290
what'd you mean?
The Queen does?

1543
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:38,283
Oh,
of England.

1544
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:42,660
There are more modern.
She's more modern.

1545
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:45,410
She hasn't felt though.
No,

1546
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,610
but I'm taught,
this is pre toto.

1547
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:51,330
This is pre modernity.
This is God's spokesman.

1548
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:52,373
This is the clue.
This has god basically the King of 

1549
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:58,230
England.
You think he wipes his own ass?

1550
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:02,460
We're all human after all.
Not King George.

1551
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:04,043
I bet you he had peasants like I bet you
he laid on his back and some servant 

1552
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,560
fucking cleaned his asshole.
I think so.

1553
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,220
I bet you there's a history historian.
Who knows.

1554
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:15,781
Hold on,
hold on.

1555
01:21:15,781 --> 01:21:17,310
Hold on.
I'm going to fucking google searches.

1556
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,030
Did King George wipe his own?
Drop the link.

1557
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:24,450
It's got a nice little illustration in 
there too.

1558
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,390
Although I'm not talking specifically 
the King of England.

1559
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:30,630
Why did medieval kings have servants to 
wipe their butt for them?

1560
01:21:30,631 --> 01:21:31,464
Couldn't they just do it themselves?
Why is this guy act like he knows for 

1561
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:39,240
top answers?
What makes you think they'd dig?

1562
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:41,130
Can you give me a source in this?
I've never heard of it.

1563
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:45,400
Oh Man.
Okay.

1564
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:48,230
This is the,
this is the kind of history that we need

1565
01:21:48,231 --> 01:21:50,600
to learn about.
Dan,

1566
01:21:50,601 --> 01:21:53,840
what did you drop me here and all times.
How did now see,

1567
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,630
Oh God,
this illustration is ill.

1568
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:58,483
It was mostly,
why is this safe to show since you're 

1569
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:03,570
writing?
Yeah,

1570
01:22:03,571 --> 01:22:05,640
I guess so.
Look at this shit,

1571
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:09,090
but this is not the king of England.
Do you understand?

1572
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:13,890
Look at her as a fine upper class woman 
though.

1573
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,440
Is She paying in a bowl?
I would think so.

1574
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:17,670
Yeah.
So you did it.

1575
01:22:17,671 --> 01:22:20,370
God,
it's come a long way.

1576
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:21,263
I love how on one hand they're like so 
over the top with how they dress and 

1577
01:22:25,351 --> 01:22:26,184
behave.
And then on the other hand she's paying 

1578
01:22:27,231 --> 01:22:29,430
in a bolt.
You know what I mean?

1579
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:33,740
Hmm.
I have a feeling that King George of,

1580
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,720
of England at the height of his power 
didn't wipe his own ass.

1581
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:39,060
Sorry.
Medieval king.

1582
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:39,923
Okay,
here you go.

1583
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:42,630
There's actually a,

1584
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:46,383
mmm.

1585
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,510
Um,
I'm reading a,

1586
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,160
this is important guys.
Bear with me.

1587
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,230
All right,
I'm closing this.

1588
01:22:51,231 --> 01:22:54,020
I'm out.
Somebody back there,

1589
01:22:54,021 --> 01:22:56,450
see if you can find the answer to that 
because this is important.

1590
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:04,730
Shame.
The Shane Jake Paul series has come to a

1591
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:08,110
finale that's finally over.
It's finally over.

1592
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:13,111
The final episode was posted at almost 
two hours long.

1593
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:18,670
Oh my God.
It was two hours long.

1594
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,520
There's two moments that really want to 
share with you guys and they're short,

1595
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:24,393
they're sweet.
I'm not going to get into the whole 

1596
01:23:25,141 --> 01:23:25,974
thing,
but I guarantee you're going to love 

1597
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:30,840
this.
So,

1598
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:33,210
um,
let's pull this clip up.

1599
01:23:33,211 --> 01:23:35,790
So this one,
Alyssa Violet,

1600
01:23:35,791 --> 01:23:40,500
who's Jake Paul's ex girlfriend,
and then she slept with Logan Paul.

1601
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:43,590
Um,
and she begged him,

1602
01:23:43,591 --> 01:23:45,420
please,
we made a mistake.

1603
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:47,610
Don't tell anybody that we slept 
together.

1604
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:53,240
Logan's response was the best.
Let's hear it.

1605
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:56,463
We just go to a club like we normally 
would do and just hung out and then 

1606
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:03,520
crank and it was just a bad decision and
we'll our parts,

1607
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:11,820
we checked it after and you were like,
I was like,

1608
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:15,130
ever like coaching.
You cannot rule on the skirt out.

1609
01:24:15,131 --> 01:24:16,660
Like it was so stupid.
And he was like,

1610
01:24:16,661 --> 01:24:18,290
listen,
like who savage,

1611
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:22,690
how far?

1612
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:27,100
That's all.
I love that.

1613
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:28,370
She's like,
please don't tell anyone.

1614
01:24:28,371 --> 01:24:29,111
And he said,
listen,

1615
01:24:29,111 --> 01:24:30,700
I'm a savage,
I'm a maverick.

1616
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,880
And then he made like a whole disc track
about it and stuff.

1617
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,160
She was in it by the way.
So I don't know.

1618
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:39,940
I really don't know what's what with 
this shit.

1619
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:43,510
I tell you what,
the new,

1620
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:48,660
the new video has over 10 million views 
and it's twoF and hours long.

1621
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:50,680
Mike.
God,

1622
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:54,550
somehow he tricked people in the Wa like
it used to be.

1623
01:24:54,551 --> 01:24:56,800
Everyone was like,
I'm so sick of Jake Paul,

1624
01:24:57,610 --> 01:24:58,443
right.
And Somehow Shane has found a way to 

1625
01:25:00,491 --> 01:25:05,491
trick people and the watch in 150 
million views in the Jake Paul.

1626
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:07,990
It's brilliant.
Um,

1627
01:25:07,991 --> 01:25:10,990
so there you go.
I'm a maverick and then second of all,

1628
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:16,020
this one of Greg Paul trying to crowd 
surf great.

1629
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,950
Paul is the biggest fucking Douche on 
the planet.

1630
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:20,900
That's what I've determined.
If anything from this.

1631
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:31,480
Yeah,
just don't do it.

1632
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:36,450
And these are kids

1633
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,850
demand.
They can't bear the load.

1634
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:39,753
Watson

1635
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,013
slowly

1636
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,180
12 year olds.
My Dude,

1637
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:50,770
don't jump on kids the way.
Just a kid.

1638
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,290
I got to watch that again.

1639
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,250
It's like,
dude,

1640
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:56,700
don't

1641
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:57,870
just say,
you know what?

1642
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:02,670
Not For me.
I'm 50 years old is so young in spirit.

1643
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:03,720
Yeah,
he's got a tie.

1644
01:26:03,721 --> 01:26:04,554
Dye.
Age is nothing but a number comes from 

1645
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:07,994
Patrick.
Kelly said,

1646
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,020
come on baby.
Ain't man doesn't want a number.

1647
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:13,943
Did R Kelly right?
That for like his 15 year old 

1648
01:26:15,021 --> 01:26:16,260
girlfriend.
Oh yeah,

1649
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,133
yeah,
yeah.

1650
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,620
That's love man.
That's crazy.

1651
01:26:21,621 --> 01:26:24,830
Our a fuck.
That's crazy.

1652
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:27,890
Yup.
People used to get away with shit.

1653
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:31,280
They don't get away with it now.
Like can you make a pile polo gang away?

1654
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:35,620
Apparently having a coke.
So people do get away with stuff still.

1655
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:40,490
But can you imagine a pop star being 
like age ain't nothing but a number baby

1656
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:41,990
cause 15 year old girlfriend.

1657
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:44,170
Okay.

1658
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:47,890
It's kind of what great Paul does.
Allegedly.

1659
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,353
Allegedly.

1660
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:52,680
Okay.

1661
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,630
I like it.
Let's hit,

1662
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,070
let us listen.
Joy as he,

1663
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,233
I'm going to hit you with the slow 
motion because I want to see this play 

1664
01:27:00,611 --> 01:27:04,650
by play.
I got to savor this moment where this is

1665
01:27:04,651 --> 01:27:06,870
the end of the documentary guys and this
is the best part.

1666
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:11,490
Okay.
Ah,

1667
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,610
the guy thinks he's like a rock star 
man.

1668
01:27:13,611 --> 01:27:18,611
There's a bunch of 12 year olds trying 
to pair your fat ass like a bag of dirt.

1669
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:22,300
There's some poor kids.
I don't,

1670
01:27:22,301 --> 01:27:27,301
I'm getting squashed.
That is nightmarish by the way.

1671
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:31,170
Turn down the music.
Yeah.

1672
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:34,750
But anyway.
Um,

1673
01:27:34,751 --> 01:27:35,584
so out of the two hour documentary,
that is pretty much shit like eight 

1674
01:27:41,711 --> 01:27:43,450
hours total,
something like that.

1675
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:48,510
Seven hours.
Guys,

1676
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,920
if you have questions,
comments,

1677
01:27:50,921 --> 01:27:52,060
suggestions,
videos,

1678
01:27:52,061 --> 01:27:53,950
something you want us to talk about or 
watch,

1679
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:58,900
email 
us@podcastaththreehthreeproductions.com

1680
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:03,250
today.
Our first question comes from Nada

1681
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:05,963
either on a podcast,
not that long ago you mentioned one of 

1682
01:28:08,071 --> 01:28:08,904
your old videos,
shake that Dick and quickly shoved the 

1683
01:28:10,291 --> 01:28:11,124
topic away in embarrassment.
You've even removed the video from the 

1684
01:28:12,601 --> 01:28:13,434
channel,
which further perpetuates the idea that 

1685
01:28:14,881 --> 01:28:15,714
you are ashamed.
But I believe that it was one of the 

1686
01:28:17,101 --> 01:28:17,934
funniest things you ever made.
So I think you should react to it and 

1687
01:28:19,891 --> 01:28:20,724
tell us how you came about making it and
how you convinced eight people to cheer 

1688
01:28:24,061 --> 01:28:26,320
you on as you shook your Dick for you 
too.

1689
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,230
Have a blessed day.
Thank you for that.

1690
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,420
Yeah,
it's embarrassing.

1691
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:34,680
I mean it's like my deck,
like you see my deck.

1692
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,520
It's like the whole outline.
It's every,

1693
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:37,373
it's very embarrassing.
I feel like maybe it's a good 

1694
01:28:39,461 --> 01:28:41,800
suggestion.
Maybe we shouldn't make a video.

1695
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:45,340
Yeah.
If an like an h three video because that

1696
01:28:45,341 --> 01:28:48,530
is the one video that my dad saw us.

1697
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:50,330
The good story.
I got this,

1698
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:51,993
I got this stone for that video.
That was the last video I shared on my 

1699
01:28:55,631 --> 01:28:58,940
facebook page.
The lore behind that video,

1700
01:28:58,941 --> 01:28:59,774
that was pretty good.
I think if anything can make a good age 

1701
01:29:02,101 --> 01:29:04,170
three video,
but like is it,

1702
01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:05,820
am I,
is it appropriate?

1703
01:29:05,821 --> 01:29:10,821
Can we show that footage?
Because it's like the outline of my Dick

1704
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,170
Underpants.
Yeah.

1705
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:13,213
You think that's fine?
I mean you don't actually see how you 

1706
01:29:15,331 --> 01:29:18,000
don't see my deck,
if,

1707
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,820
you know,
cause you can see like titties,

1708
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,730
like you could see like a tit outline 
under a shirt and that's fine.

1709
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,850
That was the whole joke,
right?

1710
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:29,760
Where's the Dick?
You get the teddies you get to ask,

1711
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:34,290
where's the deck?
I'll think about it.

1712
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:34,800
Not a,

1713
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:35,730
but,
um,

1714
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:38,430
how did we convince those people on the 
street?

1715
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:41,670
Those were real people sitting on the 
street and we were just like,

1716
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:42,893
Hey,
do you guys mind getting a little like 

1717
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:46,230
excited for us?

1718
01:29:46,430 --> 01:29:47,263
The video,
I think he's talking about the party at 

1719
01:29:49,071 --> 01:29:49,904
the end.

1720
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:51,510
Oh,
I thought of

1721
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:55,750
the old dude actor ever.
We'll save it.

1722
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:58,420
We'll talk about it.
I think there's enough floor behind that

1723
01:29:58,421 --> 01:30:01,150
to make an interesting,
this one comes from Marv.

1724
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:03,460
Hey guys.
So those people were my friends.

1725
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:04,610
Yeah.
Excellent.

1726
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:05,623
Well those are my art.
Plus they were well aware with our 

1727
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:14,290
antics by then.
Marv.

1728
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:16,540
Hey guys,
I'm ashamed to admit it,

1729
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:18,760
but I'm one of those people that eat 
buggers.

1730
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:21,850
It's been a habit of mine for as long as
I can think.

1731
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:22,713
I'll eat burgers probably once or twice 
a day less if I'm a lot of people and 

1732
01:30:26,321 --> 01:30:29,920
more if I'm alone and board.
I got good at hiding it from people.

1733
01:30:29,921 --> 01:30:33,460
He's like an alcoholic.
I hide my alcohol around the house.

1734
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:35,283
I wonder if he at wonderful put a booger
under the table and then when people 

1735
01:30:37,451 --> 01:30:41,320
leave he takes it off and eats just 
dance.

1736
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:43,840
While I'm trying to help the guy with 
hobby,

1737
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:49,930
I got good at hiding it from people.
Even for my girlfriend of five years,

1738
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,830
she's as she never knew as far as I 
know,

1739
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:56,950
even though I know it is disgusting,
I don't feel disgusted.

1740
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,650
It's weird and I'm more,
uh,

1741
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:03,370
I'm more disgusted with myself that I 
keep doing it.

1742
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,233
It's an urge that is hard to suppress,
but I feel like at least I do it less 

1743
01:31:07,871 --> 01:31:08,704
than I used to.
I tried to use other methods of 

1744
01:31:10,271 --> 01:31:12,970
disposing of boogers if they're 
available and convenient,

1745
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:15,490
but I'm a bit more,
it sounds like too,

1746
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,990
this is intense.
Um,

1747
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,713
I'm a bit more hesitant to do it if I 
know I breathed through some weird 

1748
01:31:21,491 --> 01:31:22,324
chemicals or dust with my nose since I 
believe bookers are there to catch 

1749
01:31:25,001 --> 01:31:27,520
particles to prevent it from getting in 
your lungs.

1750
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:32,640
But sometimes I'll still even do it then
there's not much of a taste to booger if

1751
01:31:33,701 --> 01:31:36,040
I'm being honest or at least not that I 
can describe.

1752
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:37,023
There are different textures though.
Mainly how hard and soft there and some 

1753
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:45,250
are more juicy.
You're probably sick and disgusting now,

1754
01:31:45,251 --> 01:31:46,960
but as I am,
there you go.

1755
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:49,090
There's not much more to it.
Thank you.

1756
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:49,990
Keep it up.
Proud of you,

1757
01:31:49,991 --> 01:31:50,621
mark.
Well,

1758
01:31:50,621 --> 01:31:53,200
first of all,
I applaud you for your brave,

1759
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:54,453
your bravery and your honesty and 
sharing this anecdote because it's 

1760
01:31:56,891 --> 01:31:57,724
important to know that they are out 
there and it's important and it's nice 

1761
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:01,054
to get in your mind and kind of see.
I love some of the little details of 

1762
01:32:05,231 --> 01:32:06,064
like,
sometimes if I'm around chemicals I'll 

1763
01:32:07,871 --> 01:32:08,704
not eat my boogers,
but sometimes I'll still eat them or 

1764
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:18,001
like I'll hide it from my girlfriend,
but I fucking hate buggers off as snarly

1765
01:32:18,821 --> 01:32:20,140
did.
Well actually,

1766
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:23,350
um,
I'm not going to shame my booger eating,

1767
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:24,603
you know,
friends and family members out there or 

1768
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:27,821
whatever,
you know,

1769
01:32:27,821 --> 01:32:29,650
I smell off fargo my hand and smell it

1770
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:32,213
so like I have never do it.
And you'll have never farted on your 

1771
01:32:35,701 --> 01:32:37,770
hand and smelled it.
You always say it as a joke because they

1772
01:32:37,771 --> 01:32:39,450
actually do it.
I have done it.

1773
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:40,020
I mean,
I don't,

1774
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:42,060
it's not something I regularly do,
but I've done it.

1775
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:44,700
Okay.
Do you not farted on your house?

1776
01:32:44,701 --> 01:32:45,534
Smelled it?
Why hasn't anyone back there farther on 

1777
01:32:47,191 --> 01:32:48,780
their hand and smelled it?
No,

1778
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,033
they had shut out.
Fucking say it like that because it's 

1779
01:32:52,141 --> 01:32:52,974
because it smells deck bro.
And I know you fargo on your hand and 

1780
01:32:57,541 --> 01:33:00,120
smell it and we'll know you ran to the 
bathroom.

1781
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:01,320
No,
again,

1782
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,110
he's doing it right now,
Zack.

1783
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,840
Of course Moses.
Oh,

1784
01:33:04,841 --> 01:33:06,240
of course.
Thank you Zach.

1785
01:33:06,241 --> 01:33:07,810
The one honest guy,
of course.

1786
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:09,960
How can you not?
Thank you Zach.

1787
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:12,480
Your honesty,
your fresh of breath.

1788
01:33:12,481 --> 01:33:14,640
Shitter.
I don't believe that.

1789
01:33:14,641 --> 01:33:16,560
Sheeko have you farted on your hands?
Smelled it.

1790
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,060
He's he's on a call.
Oh,

1791
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,043
okay.

1792
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:23,800
You don't believe Zach?
Why would not lie about that?

1793
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:26,110
No,
no.

1794
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:27,430
Zach,
are you being truthful?

1795
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,440
I swear to God.
I believe him.

1796
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:30,770
This is a familiar,
it's a guide.

1797
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:33,550
I don't believe you.
Frankly.

1798
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:35,800
I didn't.
I don't,

1799
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:37,930
I don't get,
why would you need to do that?

1800
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,270
What's the motivation?
Cause you want,

1801
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:44,620
but you're going to know that's right.
Stronger cause a stronger smell.

1802
01:33:44,850 --> 01:33:48,820
I don't factor in it too.
I haven't done it in a while,

1803
01:33:48,821 --> 01:33:49,654
but to sit here and tell me you've never
butter if copped yourself fucking 

1804
01:33:52,661 --> 01:33:57,640
outrage and ally far and you buttercup,
it never done it.

1805
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,600
Buy It.
And what else have you lied to me about?

1806
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:06,370
Um,
about this guy who eats his boogers?

1807
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:09,160
Incidentally,
a serendipitously,

1808
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:14,460
I saw this article that eating buggers 
may boost in unity.

1809
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:20,820
So there is a biological explanation for
all you people who are shoveling buggers

1810
01:34:21,311 --> 01:34:23,620
into your mouth.
Eating boogers may boost immunity.

1811
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:25,750
Scientist suspect.
I'm not going to bother to read it,

1812
01:34:25,751 --> 01:34:26,584
but you get the idea.
You're looking at this little booger 

1813
01:34:28,690 --> 01:34:29,523
picker.
I mean all that means is that they're 

1814
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:34,180
full of germs and you're just eating 
germs right?

1815
01:34:34,181 --> 01:34:35,014
There you go.
Cool.

1816
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:36,070
Exactly.
Den.

1817
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:37,343
Yeah,

1818
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:41,310
so eat your boogers.
It's good for you.

1819
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:44,640
From Ben.
Hello,

1820
01:34:44,641 --> 01:34:45,474
Ethan and Eli was listening on podcast 
88 and you all brought up the idea of 

1821
01:34:47,911 --> 01:34:50,070
enjoying the act of smelling your own 
farts.

1822
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:53,430
I would like to weigh in on this debate 
and that you know that I'm with Ethan on

1823
01:34:53,431 --> 01:34:54,264
this one.
I was against him on his wiping 

1824
01:34:56,041 --> 01:34:57,890
technique,
but this is common ground.

1825
01:34:57,891 --> 01:34:59,540
Thank you.
I'm glad we found some common ground.

1826
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:03,860
Then I like,
I think the liking,

1827
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:04,723
smelling I liking your own farm is a 
biological thing because animals 

1828
01:35:08,961 --> 01:35:11,120
naturally try to smell their own 
territory.

1829
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:12,253
So your own bodily smells will smell 
better you than they would have someone 

1830
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:17,030
else's because it indicates it's not 
their territory.

1831
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:20,750
I think that enjoying your farts is 
totally normal and human nature.

1832
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:21,823
I would even go as far as to say that 
most of us hotbox our cars with farts 

1833
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:26,750
and secretly enjoy it.

1834
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:28,633
I don't,
he goes on to say you are my favorite 

1835
01:35:30,711 --> 01:35:33,950
content creators on Youtube and Papa 
Blas.

1836
01:35:34,850 --> 01:35:37,850
Thank you.
So thank you ben for corroborating.

1837
01:35:37,851 --> 01:35:40,490
What I've always said is that isla is a 
liar.

1838
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:42,200
Prolific Liar.
In fact,

1839
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:44,870
um,
is sheeko still on the phone?

1840
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:48,290
Yeah.
Could to see.

1841
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,050
Can you ask him just,
I want to know if he's farts on his hand

1842
01:35:51,051 --> 01:35:54,110
and smells it.
Do you think he does?

1843
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:56,990
Do you find on your own hand and smell 
it?

1844
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:59,150
Ethan wants to know.
Never ever.

1845
01:35:59,151 --> 01:36:02,330
He says shaking his head because their 
lives are reasonable person.

1846
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:06,620
Give me a break.
I think it's a 50 50 kind of thing.

1847
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:11,870
I think it's a front.
Let's do a poll and do a poll.

1848
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:14,630
Alright,
here we go first.

1849
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:15,830
Well to it.
Okay.

1850
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,560
Should we say,
and that's a lot.

1851
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:19,633
Should we say?
Do you like the smell of your own farts 

1852
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:22,303
or no.
While you're talking is very different 

1853
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:28,410
to during the school cause you admit to 
liking the smell of your own farm?

1854
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,553
No.
It's you tolerate the smell of your own 

1855
01:36:33,321 --> 01:36:34,340
farm?
No,

1856
01:36:34,341 --> 01:36:37,700
I still think it smells like farts.
Wait,

1857
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:38,301
Whoa,
Whoa,

1858
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:38,631
wait,
wait,

1859
01:36:38,631 --> 01:36:39,021
wait.
Let's see.

1860
01:36:39,021 --> 01:36:39,854
I'm willing to go as far as to say that,
that my own farts don't smell as bad to 

1861
01:36:43,161 --> 01:36:45,550
me as they probably do to other people.
I'll go that far.

1862
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:48,850
It does pull down.
When you fart you,

1863
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:51,050
it bothers you the smell of your own 
farm.

1864
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:53,930
No,
I'll agree with what Dan said.

1865
01:36:53,931 --> 01:36:58,640
It's not as gross tolerable,
so it's tolerable to you as tall,

1866
01:36:58,641 --> 01:37:01,200
but that doesn't mean I go out of my way
to fucking scoop it up and my,

1867
01:37:01,201 --> 01:37:04,010
if you're sitting and watching TV and 
you rip a fat one,

1868
01:37:04,011 --> 01:37:05,450
you're not going to get up and leave the
room.

1869
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,430
No.
You'll bask in it,

1870
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:08,533
but I'm not going to enjoy it.
You're not going to breathe deep or 

1871
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:11,420
anything.

1872
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:13,280
Do you hold your nose?
Do you avoid breathing?

1873
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:14,713
No.
You don't go out of your way to avoid 

1874
01:37:15,711 --> 01:37:20,090
it.
So you breathe it and do not think about

1875
01:37:20,091 --> 01:37:21,950
the smell at all.
Do you like think like,

1876
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,090
oh,
that was a fucking,

1877
01:37:23,150 --> 01:37:25,460
that was a pretty gnarly one,
or that one wasn't that bad.

1878
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:26,323
No,
I do think.

1879
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:28,310
Okay,
so you're analyzing,

1880
01:37:28,311 --> 01:37:32,680
you're smelling it.
You are smelling your own car or,

1881
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:34,013
so what are the,
the options are you don't like your own 

1882
01:37:35,091 --> 01:37:36,740
part at all,
tolerate it?

1883
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:37,021
No,
no,

1884
01:37:37,021 --> 01:37:37,854
no.
Let's just say,

1885
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:41,000
have you ever farted on your hand and 
smelled it?

1886
01:37:41,001 --> 01:37:42,980
Yes or no?
That's the one.

1887
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:47,150
Uh,
and your whole life,

1888
01:37:47,151 --> 01:37:47,990
I mean,
you know,

1889
01:37:47,991 --> 01:37:48,824
as a kid your whole life,
have you ever once in your life now or 

1890
01:37:51,911 --> 01:37:52,760
ever before?

1891
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:56,460
Just yes or no.
All right,

1892
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:57,323
and I'm setting it to run through the 
weekend so we can get a nice sample 

1893
01:38:00,031 --> 01:38:01,710
size.
You update us?

1894
01:38:01,711 --> 01:38:02,970
No,
I'm not waiting until Monday.

1895
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:06,240
All right.
Pulls up everybody.

1896
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:11,420
Let's go finally from Alfredo.
Alfredo never betray the family.

1897
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:16,940
Hey Anthony,
first of all,

1898
01:38:16,941 --> 01:38:18,680
great to see you guys doing better 
recently.

1899
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:21,380
Hope you guys keep up the great 
momentum,

1900
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,273
but now enough of the funny business.
Well I don't think that was very fun at 

1901
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:27,650
all.
This is serious shit.

1902
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:32,710
I year ago I being a lazy ass thick boy 
chose to sit down and pee in my toilet.

1903
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:34,124
Since then,
it's been my preferred method of 

1904
01:38:35,601 --> 01:38:36,434
urination.
Recently I saw Messi come forward and 

1905
01:38:38,781 --> 01:38:42,230
mentioned that he does it as well.
This gave me the courage to mention this

1906
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:43,093
among my friends.
They all ridiculed me and made me even 

1907
01:38:45,141 --> 01:38:47,810
question my decision.
This is a guy related question.

1908
01:38:47,810 --> 01:38:49,910
I'll leave it to us guys.
Sorry.

1909
01:38:49,911 --> 01:38:52,270
Yellow.
Um,

1910
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:56,480
is it weird to pee sitting down?
Well again,

1911
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:58,700
I'm not,
I don't want to shame my fellow,

1912
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:03,500
my fellow boys here.
If you eat your boogers,

1913
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:05,023
if you pee sitting down,
that's a kind of a beautiful testament 

1914
01:39:07,941 --> 01:39:11,660
to how diverse we as human beings really
are.

1915
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:13,910
Some of us far on their own hands and 
smell it,

1916
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:15,470
which is,
as I understand it,

1917
01:39:15,471 --> 01:39:16,870
very normal and courteous.
[inaudible].

1918
01:39:16,871 --> 01:39:18,810
Let me check on that.
Um,

1919
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,203
I don't think it's weird at all.
I know a lot of guys that pee sitting 

1920
01:39:23,031 --> 01:39:25,520
down.
Personally,

1921
01:39:25,521 --> 01:39:30,521
I don't like it because I feel that I 
can't squeeze out as much liquid as when

1922
01:39:32,451 --> 01:39:35,120
I'm standing up because a lot of times 
if I'm taking a shit,

1923
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:36,950
what do you see?
La English shocked.

1924
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:38,600
What did that fuck?
Do you see?

1925
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,880
What do you see?
You look 55% yes,

1926
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,350
it's early.
It's early.

1927
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:49,470
We need more 733 votes.
It's not enough.

1928
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,560
It's not a big enough sample size.
Not a big enough sample size.

1929
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,590
That is a statistically viable.
No.

1930
01:39:56,820 --> 01:40:01,820
Yes it is 700 that will change maybe 5% 
really fast.

1931
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:07,350
Well,
that will 5% at most from now and either

1932
01:40:07,351 --> 01:40:09,970
direction.
That's what I'm telling you.

1933
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:14,010
All went down.
It went down.

1934
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:18,390
This is why I gave it three days.
We,

1935
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:22,080
we need thousands of responses.
Reaming and a cloud of Fart.

1936
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:26,100
You guys are the weird,
you guys are the weird ones.

1937
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:31,620
When you scratch your balls,
do you smell your hand?

1938
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,233
Oh yeah,
of course.

1939
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:36,040
No.
Why?

1940
01:40:36,710 --> 01:40:37,980
Why?
Why would you?

1941
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:40,530
Because it's the same thing.
You want to know what's going on there?

1942
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:42,143
What am I crazy?
How smelly or your balls really has a 

1943
01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:47,280
sense.
There's nothing to smell.

1944
01:40:47,281 --> 01:40:48,114
Sometimes there's a little Bob,
a good new smells plan or not your 

1945
01:40:51,751 --> 01:40:53,040
balls,
but like your region,

1946
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:55,390
like you're fucking region.
Especially shampoos.

1947
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,030
Gibbs.

1951
01:41:10,570 --> 01:41:11,470

1952

You love your man Musk.

Thank you.
Sacral though man.

1954
01:41:18,731 --> 01:41:22,330

they're really happy to get behind,

1955
01:41:22,331 --> 01:41:25,990

You know like the area between like your

1956
01:41:25,991 --> 01:41:26,824
thighs.
You know that that's what I'm talking 

1957
01:41:28,961 --> 01:41:31,540
about.
He loves it.

1958
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:35,980
I love it.
All right me say it's not over.

1959
01:41:35,981 --> 01:41:39,190
It's just beginning and you make sure

1960
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:40,960
what are we at right now?
What's the percentage?

1961
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:45,340
It's 54 46 was changing so much.
Give me a break.

1962
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:49,720
Listen,
what we're doing here is important.

1963
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:51,083
East stigmatizing.
We are getting out in the open that we 

1964
01:41:53,471 --> 01:41:55,060
are beautiful,
diverse creatures.

1965
01:41:55,061 --> 01:41:55,894
Some of us piece sitting down,
some of us eat our own bookers and some 

1966
01:41:58,721 --> 01:42:02,560
of us far in our hands and smell it.
Okay and can still be gross?

1967
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:05,950
Nope.
Nope.

1968
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:07,503
That will cannot be.
I'm just saying we're out there and 

1969
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:10,663
maybe we maybe,
maybe it'd be nice Ila to not feel 

1970
01:42:13,331 --> 01:42:16,960
ashamed of myself all the time.
You know?

1971
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:19,383
Oh I took a piece of shit at the toilet 
and smelled it big fucking whoop that 

1972
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:26,403
you do that right?

1973
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:33,990
I think it's interesting that 55% of the
people for the 53 Ooh,

1974
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,073
people are goofing on me.
If anything you guys just be honest on 

1975
01:42:38,891 --> 01:42:42,940
this poll but either way you said 10% so
I don't give a fuck what it drops.

1976
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:47,150
You just got coby don this,

this sample to this is the live 
audience.

1978
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:51,860
We got to wait for the vod audience.
Still Rolling.

1979
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:53,383
Cut from a different cloth.
How many people have voted now a seven 

1980
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:01,540
you're going to tell me that's not a 
significant sample size.

1981
01:43:01,630 --> 01:43:05,970
1700 people.
Give me a break cause her walking.

1982
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:08,540
You guys think you're so special.
You don't fart on you smell it.

That's all I've got here today.

1989
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:35,510
So I think we covered a lot of ground.
I think we learned a lot.

1990
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:36,703

2026
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:28,960

2027
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:34,330

2032
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:44,980
I know this is a mate.
This is a compelling stuff.

2033
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:48,880
Harrison talked to me for Christ's sake.
The fuck is going on.

2034
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:53,870
Well,
are you sure it's working?

2035
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:58,310
I think it's obviously not.
Well the do didn't want to come and look

2036
01:45:58,311 --> 01:45:59,144
at it.
Oh,

2037
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:00,343
you want to just prolong this?
I was just going to ask them if they 

2038
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:06,380
fire in their hand or not.
I didn't care about anything that I just

2039
01:46:06,381 --> 01:46:09,350
want to know about their habits in the 
bathroom.

2040
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:14,030
Then I think let's just,
okay,

2041
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:19,060
let's wrap this baby up guys.
All to all my fellow hand farting.

2042
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:23,943
Want me to tell you what we know?
You know what I liked the most about 

2043
01:46:25,551 --> 01:46:27,100
people that far in the hand and smell 
dealer.

2044
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:32,180
It's not 52% still.
You Act like that's a victory for you.

2045
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:34,663
I'm just saying it's going down.
You know what I like about people at 

2046
01:46:36,581 --> 01:46:37,414
[inaudible]?
They are courageous and they are 

2047
01:46:40,171 --> 01:46:41,004
truthful.

2048
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,410
Yeah.

2049
01:46:44,410 --> 01:46:47,380
I find it hard to believe that people 
don't like the smell of their own farts.

2050
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,660
It's like,
but you're saying it like you enjoy it.

2051
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,060
I do.
I enjoy it and it was so wild and what's

2052
01:46:54,061 --> 01:46:54,894
hard to believe?
It's the gross smell because it's like 

2053
01:46:56,461 --> 01:46:59,840
biological,
I feel like you almost cannot deny it.

2054
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:02,850
Cause if you're willing to sit there and
analyze the smell of your own heart,

2055
01:47:02,851 --> 01:47:06,060
which you admit to doing,
and a sense you couldn't do that without

2056
01:47:06,061 --> 01:47:09,930
enjoying you put in and Jay,
you couldn't do that without going good.

2057
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:10,950
Right?
No.

2058
01:47:10,951 --> 01:47:13,350
You're not making any sense.
Why?

2059
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:17,040
I'm not analyzing,
I'm just sitting there and thinking like

2060
01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:18,203
people.
Do you think all the time you're 

2061
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:21,540
thinking yourself,
what kind of far does that,

2062
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:22,820
if you could just take a smell.
Oh,

2063
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:25,560
it's like,
oh this is really growth.

2064
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:28,020
Or Oh this is not that bad.
You know?

2065
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:30,270
It's just taught.
I like when it's grocer.

2066
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:33,330
Okay.
Like a diarrhea fart.

2067
01:47:33,331 --> 01:47:34,164
You're like,
damn,

2068
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:36,600
that shit is foul,
but it's good.

2069
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:39,240
I don't know what,
are you kidding?

2070
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:42,660
I'm not kidding.
I'm being real with you right now.

2071
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:46,170
I Dunno.
My grossing you out.

2072
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,810
Well,
I think it's gross.

2073
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:53,550
Yeah,
I think I thought that was the,

2074
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:58,820
most people think that fart smell 
amazing now that over 50% say they fired

2075
01:48:00,151 --> 01:48:00,984
on the end of the smell.
It like that's kind of an interesting 

2076
01:48:02,761 --> 01:48:03,720
revelation,
right?

2077
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:04,950
It is.
So there you go.

2078
01:48:04,951 --> 01:48:05,784

So they're coming on Wednesday at the 

2095
01:48:54,921 --> 01:48:57,500

And then the day after that,

2096
01:48:57,501 --> 01:48:58,334
I'm so excited.
I'm taking the whole family to 

2097
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:00,323
Disneyland.
We are cause for some reason all of our 

2098
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:07,640
family member's birthday is in the same 
season.

2099
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:10,940
It's all in the fall.
So we're doing a client family bonanza.

2100
01:49:10,941 --> 01:49:14,210
There's 10 of us going together.
It's going to be fricking awesome.

2101
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:17,570
So if you were in Disneyland,
are you sure it's on Thursday?

2102
01:49:17,571 --> 01:49:18,404

The end of this podcast is so off the 

2103
01:49:20,751 --> 01:49:22,970
rails.
I'm just looking at my fucking calendar.

2104
01:49:23,150 --> 01:49:24,020

Okay.

2113
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:57,313

2114
01:49:59,981 --> 01:50:03,550
smelling farts.
