So welcome one and all to the current 
events experience.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,463
Oh,

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,573
There you go.

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,690

00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,810
trinkets,

19
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,110
hats.
Y'all better head on down to [inaudible]

20
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:58,840
dot com slash collection slash sale.
Wow.

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,320
Some of these aren't even sold out,
so there is serious urgency here,

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,773
right?

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,680
This is serious.
Let's just get.

24
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:12,514
Let's just get right into it.
We have the best opinions here at the 

25
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:19,270
podcast.
You're going to find out.

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,110
That's what I'm talking about actually 
for the rest of the month.

27
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:25,330
We have gas book them,
book the book,

28
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,643

to you guys a Tuesday episode with 

29
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:33,670
current events and cutting edge.
Well thought out,

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,990
well informed opinions that are correct 
every time they're expressed,

31
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:39,843
and if you disagree,
it may be time to switch the channel 

32
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,730
because these are correct opinions.
Go for the day.

33
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,200
Let's start from the top.
Baby.

34
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,050
You know I was told I was joking with 
Isla.

35
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,600
Yeah,
just a week ago.

36
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:53,434
I said,
you know what is a funny joke maybe to 

37
00:01:55,271 --> 00:02:00,271
tweet Isla with back to school,
a lar backpack.

38
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,471
I was like,
Hey,

39
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:05,270
get 50 percent off your Kevlar backpacks
back to school sale.

40
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,280
And he was like,
tasteless.

41
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:09,190
Don't tweet it.
I thought it was probably too far.

42
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:09,881
I was like,
okay,

43
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:12,490
maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm just twisted sick individual.

44
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,190
Guess what we saw were what?
What?

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,820
What News station was this on?
Here?

46
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:21,160
Let me pop this up.
Fox News,

47
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,820
Fox business,
one of those fucking business.

48
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,760
Are we separating?
So there's different St.

49
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,910
Yeah,
that's pretty much the same thing.

50
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:28,900
Well,
anyway,

51
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,630
on Fox News,
this is.

52
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,130
There's so many layers of greatness to 
this.

53
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:34,450
This is the good for the day.
By the way,

54
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:37,450
if you guys,
we need to regimen it out.

55
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,300
You Go.
So

56
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,673
selling bulletproof vest,
bulletproof backpack while playing 

57
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,380
bulletproof.
The song sponsored by Chrysler

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,233
was tasteless.
Now we're just going to make a little 

59
00:02:58,571 --> 00:02:59,980
joke and here they're

60
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,350
selling it on the news sponsored by 
Chrysler.

61
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,280
You know,
it's like damn.

62
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:09,020
It's like the car company.
Yeah,

63
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,590
it's all sponsored by Chrysler school 
shootings sponsored by Chrysler here.

64
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,330
Meeting this morning.
Mc Armor is the company behind high end.

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,440
Bulletproof backpacks and clothing that 
are revamping.

66
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,480
Just shoot her point blank.
That'll,

67
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,370
that'll,
that'll teach the kids how to,

68
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:32,920
uh,
make sure their backpacks works.

69
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,230
I remember kids,
if you want to ensure that your backpack

70
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,093
isn't a bulletproof,
bring a gun to school and shoot your 

71
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:39,670
friend.
Point blank is this,

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,570
this is anticipated to reach more than 
$5,000,000,000

73
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,100
in the next seven years.
That would be the,

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,540
as a school shooting.

75
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,250
Oh,
they really projecting a lot by 20,

76
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,123
25.
You cannot project out seven years and 

77
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,280
seven years.
I'm projected to be the president.

78
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,890
See if that happens.
So I thought this was just a goof.

79
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,820
I thought this was a total blast.
So next time you guys go to the Chrysler

80
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:13,490
dealership,
remember school shootings saying,

81
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:18,491
have a backpack with your new Chrysler.
Get up Kevlar backpack.

82
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,540
How excuses not going to do.
And that's just like,

83
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,630
well imagine there's like an active 
shooter.

84
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,720
You're like,
Whoa,

85
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,563
your backpack around the front.
I'm just trying to like dodged the 

86
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:37,150
bullet and shit.
Brought to you by Chrysler.

87
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,260
So who's tasteless now about my ideas 
now too.

88
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,200
It kind of a forward thinker,
aren't they?

89
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,753
See I did it as a joke,
but these guys are serious as as a I 

90
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:51,664
want to say schools,
the traditional saying is as serious as 

91
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:54,574
a heart attack and I want to revise it 
to as serious as a school shooting for 

92
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:02,290
as much extra tastelessness as possible.
Now,

93
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,940
Isla,
you've heard the saying,

94
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:07,180
they're taking our jobs.
Robots are taking our jobs.

95
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,163
I've expressed concern on this very 
podcast than automation are taking our 

96
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,600
jobs.
Now.

97
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,583
This video is going to haunt you.
It is going to really concern you and 

98
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:22,660
hopefully everyone watching at home.
This is not to be taken lightly.

99
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,040
Okay.
What we have here is a golfing robot.

100
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,790
If they can golf better than us,
then we are really.

101
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:31,960
Fuck.
Look at this Golfer

102
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,523
yesterday.
A robot taking a swipe at this robot 

103
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,470
called Hail.
You know it's true.

104
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,260
You know,
it's real positive.

105
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,423
Look at these guys jumping and cheering 
for their heralding the end and 10 

106
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,440
years.
They're not going to be golfers anymore.

107
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:53,910
She's going to a bunch of robots on the 
field.

108
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,133
Hitting balls,

109
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,930
golf,
robotic football,

110
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:03,890
basketball.
She's gonna.

111
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:04,724
Be Robot.

112
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,710
That is actually pretty cool though.
You won't see that again.

113
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:10,670
Yellow.
Yeah.

114
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,270
Really cool.
Down

115
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,970
robot will take it a swipe.
It kind of looks like the guy that would

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,680
play golf or something.
Insane.

117
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,840
Shot robot.
Dude.

118
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,110
His name is eldrich.

119
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,790
Hold on one second.
Value your jobs.

120
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,740
They're coming for all of them.
A Post Malone,

121
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,340
our dear friend.
I don't know if you guys follow this has

122
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:41,130
just happened this morning.
Um,

123
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,780
well last night he won song of the year 
vms.

124
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,850
Very proud of him.
Yeah,

125
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,520
he won it for Rockstar and just I just,
I want to congratulate him.

126
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,820
I want to say I love him.
He's a sweet,

127
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,020
dear,
great guy.

128
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:02,670
He deserves it and it's insane to see 
what he's accomplished since we met him.

129
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,943
I mean even just this year,
we probably met him like two years ago 

130
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,680
now,
but like this year alone,

131
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,920
since his new album came out,
it was crazy.

132
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,760
Damn.
And it's easy to forget what is.

133
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,520
He's 23 years old.
Okay.

134
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,870
That should make everybody at home 
depressing.

135
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,800
That depresses the hell out of me.
But I was 23 years old.

136
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,623
I was probably playing world of warcraft
and it in a disgusting dormitory room 

137
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,480
with like leftover Burrito's.
I mean I was going nowhere fast.

138
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,970
Pretty incredible.
What a 23 year old can accomplish.

139
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:42,750
So love and pride for him.
Let's watch his acceptance speech.

140
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Here you go.
Twenty one savage,

141
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,930
right?
I just want it,

142
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,803
you know,
you go to bed and you dream about maybe 

143
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,950
winning and then whenever you get up 
here you don't remember what the hell to

144
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:23,320
say because you wrote it on.
But you know,

145
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,430
thank you so much everybody that was,
he's not that tall.

146
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,650
He's a tall guy,
but he's not that tall.

147
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,170
Why y'all making them laugh like he's 
five,

148
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:39,990
two for Christ's sake.
I mean the guy,

149
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:40,824
it's his big moment.
Why are you making them punch over like 

150
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:43,220
that?
That's a good point though.

151
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,020
Damn the song.
Um,

152
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,050
thank you everybody for listening.

153
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,230
It's funny.
We know a lot of them.

154
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,560
Honestly,
in 100 million years I would never

155
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,380
expect to do this ever.
So this is sick and uh,

156
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,253
thank you so much.

157
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,963
Yeah.

158
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,930
Oh,
21 post.

159
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,940
Close the mic on that.
Thank you to east Atlanta.

160
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,390
Lower than like more

161
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,140
lower the mic.
They found like a button.

162
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,350
Like can we lower the mic on savage by 
the way?

163
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,213
I have.
We were at his birthday party and I was 

164
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:22,491
like,
man,

165
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:26,000
I want to get them a sixth birthday gift
because he's like such a good friend.

166
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,480
He bought you a really beautiful gift on
your birthday.

167
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,080
He got isla,
like this limited edition,

168
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,943
Supreme Fender Strat Guitar.
There's only like 30 of them in the 

169
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,750
world.
Yeah,

170
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,643
I don't,
I don't have anything that is so 

171
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:42,794
valuable.
Other than that I didn't know what to 

172
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:45,980
do.
I didn't take it on the wall,

173
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,050
but he just shows up.
He shows up like a couple hours after he

174
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,060
shows up,
some dude shows up with a guitar.

175
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,373
Yeah.
And it was like this incredible fender 

176
00:09:57,351 --> 00:10:00,170
strap,
supreme limited edition.

177
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:00,981
And I was like,
oh wow.

178
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:01,814
Really Cool Guitar.
Like I didn't even understand that he 

179
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:04,430
was giving it to you.

180
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,710
I thought the guy just delivered it to 
post and then he left.

181
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,091
I was like,
Oh,

182
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:10,910
we forgot his guitar.
And he was like,

183
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,280
it's for me.
No,

184
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,910
I didn't get that.
But anyway,

185
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:14,511
I was like,
Damn,

186
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:17,440
how the fuck do we top that?
So well you can't.

187
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,940
So.
Well I can't really.

188
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,253
But I was like,
how I got to get them a really nice 

189
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:24,800
gift.
So I got,

190
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,540
I went down,
he's a gun fanatic.

191
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,060
We've been to this gun store together 
and I got them this cool little snippy.

192
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,750
I'm,
what'd you just link me,

193
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:33,584
Dan?
What I think is the guitar that you're 

194
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:35,841
talking about.
Oh,

195
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:37,250
let's show it.
And we got pictures on deck,

196
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,280
did we?
We're so interactive.

197
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:41,114
We are.
So this is such an experience that we 

198
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,460
can just talk about something and show 
it to you at the same time.

199
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,620
Cutting edge technology here.
This is such an experience.

200
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:52,454
If only I could do it within.
Actually pretty incredible stuff here 

201
00:10:59,061 --> 00:10:59,894
folks,
Birdie,

202
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,210
Birdie,
incredible stuff here folks.

203
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,490
Okay.
I'm still,

204
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:07,670
I don't know.
How do you display it to you?

205
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,760
Do you frame it?
Because it also comes in a nice box.

206
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,420
Do you keep it in the box or not?
You take it out of the box.

207
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,763
I think you,
you.

208
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,400
I mean there's mounts for guitars.
I think kind of just like a wall piece.

209
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,460
I don't think you.
I think you just hang it.

210
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,590
But anyway,
I'm calling you.

211
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:27,650
His birthday isla was gone so I was 
Kinda on my own by the way,

212
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,830
taking care of myself,
which is hard enough as it is.

213
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,960
And so I go to this gunshot.
I'm like,

214
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,000
what can I do?
What can I get posted?

215
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,990
So he had ordered this really cool glock
from them and I was like,

216
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,570
I want to get him something dope.
So I got him this little snipey cool ass

217
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,040
laser snipey they put on top of the 
Glock,

218
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,260
right?
That the official name?

219
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:49,520
Or are you just calling it?
It's an APP.

220
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,910
It's called a snipey.

221
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,760
It's a.
it's a scope.

222
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,313
It's a sick ass scope by the way,
because you only see it if you look 

223
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:02,290
through the snipey hole.
So if you got someone locked on,

224
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,410
they don't see the laser right here.
Like in the movies only you see it.

225
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,840
It's an Ip then.
Right.

226
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,730
And I got him like a thousand rounds.
I thought I was feeling pretty good.

227
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,870
I had like two ammo boxes,
a snipey,

228
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,500
a bunch of rounds and I was like,
no,

229
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,260
that's a thoughtful gift.
Personal.

230
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,243
It's pretty weird to show up into a 
party where it was a big party and I 

231
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:26,800
felt a little bit strange showing up 
with Ammo at that gun store.

232
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:28,330
I was like,
are you sure this is okay?

233
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,083
It's funny.
I actually went in there to buy him a 

234
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,130
weapon.
I was like,

235
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,090
I'm going to buy him a gun.

236
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,610
They're like,
you can't like what?

237
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,453
What are you fucking stupid?
You can't buy him a gun and bring it to 

238
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:40,570
a party.
I was like,

239
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,860
Oh,
I guess that does make sense.

240
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,753
I guess that's probably a good thing.
I guess that's the one thing you can do 

241
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,290
in America.
I was like,

242
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,310
that's probably.
Yeah,

243
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:51,010
that's probably a good thing.
It's funny.

244
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:53,230
On one hand I'm like,
here on the show being like gun control,

245
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,240
I'm like,
can I buy a weapon?

246
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,190
And then on the same day give it to 
somebody else.

247
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,911
They're like,
no,

248
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,670
dude,
I guess that makes sense.

249
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,050
Anyway,
I bought a bunch of Ammo,

250
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:04,690
thousand rounds of snipey.
I probably spent like $1,500.

251
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,250
Pretty good.
Yeah.

252
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:08,941
I was like,
Damn.

253
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:11,370
I hooked up my dude up and then I,
I,

254
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,780
I,
he comes and I was like,

255
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:13,501
hey man,
check out.

256
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,030
But I got you.
And he was very gracious.

257
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:15,864
Isn't about post at all.
This is more a rant against 21 savage 

258
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,330
because I have beef with that guy.
He doesn't know it,

259
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,630
so I mean pulse was very gracious,
very sweet as you know.

260
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:25,464
He's a perfect angel.
Probably the closest thing to a perfect 

261
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:31,770
human being and then savage shows up and
he gives him,

262
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:35,460
I shit you not like five minutes later,
100,000

263
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:36,294
dollar watch.

264
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,190
I'm like,
okay,

265
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:42,024
Mr.
fucking hip hop you gotta show my broke 

266
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:47,460
ass up.
You know,

267
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,960
what kind of watch was it?
Do you remember?

268
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,003
I Dunno it,
but it was like on the news and now 

269
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,193
twitter news.
Where's my snipey and the that was 

270
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,293
newsworthy and now I see Austin walking 
around with his sick ass hundred 

271
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,063
thousand dollar watch.
Don't see them walking around with this 

272
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:09,801
snipey.
It's not about how much the gift cost,

273
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,573
it's about the gesture.
In this case it was most definitely 

274
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,850
about.
Well he loved to watch.

275
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,380
He was a great watch.
He was a great gift.

276
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:20,214
I just honestly wish maybe you could 
have waited and given it to him before 

277
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:25,680
the party,
you know,

278
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:26,514
like maybe a different time.
So it was just kind of rude to me 

279
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:35,280
personally.
And I do take it as a kind of a problem.

280
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,680
So if you see savage,
let him know that we do have beef.

281
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,210
Don't let him know everyone's going to 
be.

282
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,620
Hmm.
No.

283
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,930
But anyway,
congratulations to post them.

284
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,740
And then this morning that happened last
night.

285
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,470
And this morning,
uh,

286
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,523
I see my brother in law who's like,
somehow like we got to hire my brother 

287
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,980
research.
This guy is like in tune with the world.

288
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,420
He,
uh,

289
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,253
he sends me a TMZ article.
It's like post Malone's airplane is 

290
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:13,070
stuck in the air.
The wheels blew out when they take off,

291
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,023
by the way,
what are the wheels just blow up when 

292
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:16,934
you're taking off.

293
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,473
How's that a thing?

294
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,033
So he's circling around doing an,
about to do an emergency landing there 

295
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,560
in the air,
doing circles,

296
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:31,910
trying to burn up fuel to reduce the 
weight so they can,

297
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,690
you know,
land more safely.

298
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,530
Carry.
And so anyway,

299
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:43,120
he landed.
He is safe or vault.

300
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:43,954
Very happy about that.
We were watching live here in the 

301
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,470
office.
Um,

302
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,940
he made this tweet.
I landed,

303
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,230
guys,
thank you for your prayers.

304
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:54,140
CanNot believe how many people wished 
death on me.

305
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,780
Fuck you.
But not today.

306
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,380
I can't believe that.
When I read that,

307
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,041
I was like,
whoa.

308
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,030
I didn't see any.
I mean,

309
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:03,300
I wasn't looking well.
Yeah,

310
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:06,800
but I wasn't leaving.
But people are so insane.

311
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,570
Be like,
imagine he's on the airplane,

312
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,210
like super scared and he's reading shit.
Like I hope he crashes and dies.

313
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,083
I'm like,
what?

314
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,890
Y'All are fucking need Jesus.
I would never say that to anyone,

315
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,870
but if you said that to him,
you need Jesus.

316
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,310
Can you.
Can you diagnose that Ila,

317
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,183
why are people saying that to them?
Do they need Jesus or what are they 

318
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,673
missing?

319
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,300
Um,
no.

320
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,880
They just knew their life.
Yeah.

321
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,060
So anyway,
love.

322
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,193
Congratulations.
Appreciations to post malone safe and 

323
00:16:43,781 --> 00:16:44,614
he's alive

324
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,280
and he's looking good.

325
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,580
Is looking good.
It's got all this suits lately.

326
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,091
Yeah,
I know.

327
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:55,970
It's crazy.
You look thin in that vma video.

328
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:56,721
Two.
Yeah,

329
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:58,730
I think also a lot of weight.
I think he's losing weight.

330
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,940
He's slamming his jam and he's a 
Rockstar.

331
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,233
Loves us.
Now moving on to something more 

332
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:07,100
interesting than that.
Somebody emailed me.

333
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,270
Oh,
uh,

334
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,460
over the past couple of days and email 
that kind of stood out to me and sort of

335
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,000
shocked me.
He said to me,

336
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,163
Hey,
I've been listening a lot to your 

337
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:18,810
conversation about wiping and anal,
you know,

338
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,180
cleanliness and hygiene,
and he says,

339
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,550
you know,
what I do is I near my asshole.

340
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,860
I was like,
Whoa,

341
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,870
there is a topical cream that you apply 
to the hair and then you.

342
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,420
And then basically it burns it off and 
you just wipe it clean.

343
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,733
So this guy was like,
I use sensitive Nair on my asshole rink 

344
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,280
and I wiped the hair.
I was like,

345
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,460
whoa.
That is so insane and hilarious.

346
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:50,010
I think I have to try it.
I think you

347
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:55,010
shouldn't because this stuff is like,
you could burn your skin.

348
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,210
I actually,
I didn't know what it was.

349
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:02,211
I went on Amazon just to check the 
reviews and like most of the reviews are

350
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,880
pictures of people got burned,
seen assholes.

351
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,023
No

352
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,373
assholes.
More resilient or less resilient really 

353
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,350
because it touched his shit.
I think they would have let him know.

354
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,473
Well,
I think that's part of the charm is 

355
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,010
that,
I mean,

356
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,370
first of all,
I'm in the pursuit of knowledge.

357
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,380
This is like forbidden fruit,
forbidden knowledge and Biblical and the

358
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:30,470
Biblical on emission.
It's more important.

359
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,870
It's not just a mission.
This is God's work.

360
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,590
Read the Messenger.
If you read the Bible,

361
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:40,760
the story of Adam and Eve,
the apple is the forbidden knowledge.

362
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,843
People don't always talk about how they 
wiped their ass and cleaned their ass 

363
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:47,780
and these important things that we need 
to collectively share our knowledge.

364
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,820
So I think of myself as kind of a 
trailblazer of a kind of a,

365
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,770
a Magellan,
Christopher Columbus.

366
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,100
I don't know.
I think he was someone who explored.

367
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,410
Okay,
I'm an explorer.

368
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,480
I'm kind of a Darwin,
if you will.

369
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,420
I'm a great thinker.
They said Isaac Newton,

370
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,620
Isaac Newton said of himself,
I'm not a giant.

371
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,100
I just stand on the shoulders of those 
before me.

372
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,830
[inaudible].
That's what I'm.

373
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,950
How is that related?
Because I'm how to ask wiping giant.

374
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,983
I lent.
I stand on the shoulders of the wealth 

375
00:19:24,891 --> 00:19:26,930
of knowledge with those who've come 
before me.

376
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,430
Nobody has dared and the history of 
mankind as far as I can tell,

377
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,280
to collect this knowledge and to share 
it with the world.

378
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,323
This is important stuff.
So I think the pursuit of the forbidden 

379
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:45,041
fruit and the biblical tale of Adam and 
Eve there is much the same.

380
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,180
And so I will near my asshole

381
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,623
and he burned.
Narrow is like a something you put 

382
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,660
inside your asphalt really when you 
like.

383
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,763
What is it?
Let's say you need to take a pill but 

384
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,813
throw your right.

385
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,870
It's like medicine or would you call a 
suppository?

386
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,360
Yeah.
So that's what that's called.

387
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:08,290
And they're.
Oh,

388
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,570
that's this show.
The first time you said that to me,

389
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:12,900
I was like,
what do you mean [inaudible]?

390
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,873
You're good.

391
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,160
That's almost a sign from God.
I mean,

392
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,730
he grows God's language,
right?

393
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,100
So narrow in a way was almost a destiny.
The destiny will use of nir was.

394
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,750
So you kind of supporting my,
my um.

395
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,970
Well I think for think this week I'm in 
there,

396
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:36,840
my asshole for better or worse if it 
burns,

397
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,540
if it cures.
I mean,

398
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,473
I have never had a wipe in recent memory
that wasn't Harry and I think that this 

399
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:50,560
could be it.
Has the metamucil been helping you?

400
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,260
Love it.
It's not a cure all,

401
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:56,020
like a lot of people and asking for 
updates on the metamucil,

402
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,073
this fiber supplement.
I haven't been taking it too because 

403
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:00,780
it's also just fiber,
which should be good.

404
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,440
But like when I,
I didn't notice any difference in.

405
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,320
Yeah,
see the first time I took it,

406
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:11,500
I swear to God it was like Teflon Colon.
I just slid right out.

407
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,890
Yeah.
Um,

408
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,790
but for me it's not the end all 
situation.

409
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,140
Like Chris had I,
I'm,

410
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,750
I have a hybrid situation.
I,

411
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,123
I'm using less baby wipes,
but I'm still ending what supposedly he 

412
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:29,860
takes more because there's these huge 
pills and they say you have to take like

413
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,560
a year of them and thinking,
whoa.

414
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,990
Yeah.
Well I'm curious,

415
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:36,880

00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:38,611
counseling pretty much right away after 
they hook you up with a counselor that's

456
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,800
affordable.
Therapy is expensive,

457
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:46,010
which is kind of such bs because 
everybody

458
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,990
needs help.
In fact,

459
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,783
you might even say poor people are the 
ones that have more shit to deal with 

460
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,180
because everybody needs money,
but guess what?

461
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:58,310
It's way cheaper than in person 
counseling.

462
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,310
There's therapists costs like $300 an 
hour,

463
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,730
but okay,
I'll share.

464
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:06,830
I'll spend half of my paycheck to talk 
to,

465
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,053
but here's the thing.
Pricing is between 35 to $65 a week for 

466
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:14,504
unlimited counseling.
Meaning you are connected with a 

467
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:19,670
counselor the entire time via your phone
or a computer.

468
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,670
You can schedule a video phone or tech 
sessions when necessary.

469
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:23,504
Usually once per week.
They also have financial aid available 

470
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,000
that you can apply for.
If you need help,

471
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,380
you can afford it.
Great,

472
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,120
wonderful.
Beautiful.

473
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,140
What a great service with better help.
You're not wasting time traveling,

474
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,123
going to and fro.
A lot of people have trouble face to 

475
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:41,030
face with people.
It's embarrassing.

476
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,320
It's tough.

477
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,153
It's hard,
but this is a beautiful thing about 

478
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:48,140
this.
The service you're online,

479
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,180
you can have video,
you can have a chat.

480
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,073
Whatever you're comfortable with,
whatever level with they're there to 

481
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:53,834
help you out.
A lot of people are not comfortable 

482
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:59,060
talking to therapist so that best way to
do it,

483
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,120
to get in the door is with better help.
When I was at my worst with anxiety,

484
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:05,504
it was so.
It was impossible for me to go into an 

485
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:08,324
office and get the help that I needed.
That's the beautiful thing about better 

486
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:13,040
help.
So guys,

487
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,220
if you want me to talk to somebody for 
any reason at all,

488
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,790
this is the way to try it out.
Go to better help.com/h

three.

Thank you for sponsoring us.
Welcome back to the.

492
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,690
Basically,
if you're looking for opinions,

493
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,583
look no further.
This podcast and this is the opinion 

494
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:44,210
podcast experience,
whatever that means.

495
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,163
I honestly,
I'm a little flustered because I'm just 

496
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,413
not used to this three minute breaks.
Just ran back from the bathroom and 

497
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:51,890
literally Dan was like,
hurry up,

498
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,640
like jumped into the seat.
Literally four seconds.

499
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:56,720
He's got my paper towel.

500
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,740
So as promised guys,
we've got a thrill ride here,

501
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:06,770
lined up.
This video shocked me.

502
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,210
Okay.
So I've been educated.

503
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:09,044
That's good.
It wasn't before this video shocked me 

504
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,940
frankly,
like no video I've seen in a long time.

505
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,553
And the story,
the scoop originally was that it was 

506
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:22,160
fully monetized for a long time,
which I get,

507
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,080
I guess you can only blame you for so 
much.

508
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:25,940
It's called do vegans actually taste 
better?

509
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:26,774
So it's like how,
how does youtube know that a dude is 

510
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,673
guzzling his own Jizz on camera?
The part that really gets me about this 

511
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:39,611
video by the way,
Gay God damn measurement called

512
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,180
Jugaad whose name I kind of liked that 
the Jugaad.

513
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,703
So the thing that really gets me is that
he's a key Jesus and like a little kind 

514
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:58,240
of medicine cup and then he tastes it 
and then he's like,

515
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,313
he loves it,
but then he drinks it three more times 

516
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:02,884
and he finishes the Cup and I am 
actually getting nauseous as I did that 

517
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,120
too.
So this video is clearly per.

518
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,900
So you definitely,
if you're going to drink,

519
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:16,960
you have kids on camera like that.
You're definitely the gay God.

520
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,290
Not many people can step to you on that 
level.

521
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,440
Autumn of this.
Do you begin to actually taste better?

522
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,890
And I have actually been Vegan for 12 
years,

523
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,903
over 12 years.
So who better to test this theory that 

524
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:33,100
me,
myself,

525
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:35,800
and I haven't really tasted myself in 
quite a while.

526
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,240
What the fuck is wrong?
Is this nothing weird?

527
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,140
Like you're supposed to know what he's 
talking about.

528
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,420
He's drank his own tj's nobody didn't 
say that yet.

529
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,220
It's just saying I haven't tasted myself
in a while.

530
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,680
Like you're supposed to know what that 
means.

531
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,600
People watching readily gay God know 
what that means.

532
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:59,190
I'm subscribed to [inaudible] channel 
serious on his channel.

533
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,750
But like how frequently are you drinking
your own con?

534
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,363
Huh?

535
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,953
But how is this not like a weird fetish 
like drinking or common front of people 

536
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:14,110
publicly is kind of.
Probably is.

537
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,003
Yeah.

538
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,213
So I might have went ahead and shot a 
little bit of myself into this shot 

539
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:21,494
glass and I kind of want to be open and 
honest with you guys and tell you what 

540
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,860
they actually tastes like.

541
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,010
Suggested my first time experiencing 10 
inches.

542
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,670
That's what it says in the top right?
This is certainly the gay God might do,

543
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,610
but like what?
I just don't understand.

544
00:28:40,611 --> 00:28:42,440
Like you're,
you can be gay.

545
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,580
Like obviously no one cares that you're 
gay in this day and age,

546
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,653
but like when your whole identity,
everything you do and talk about and is 

547
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,613
like a bow like that you're gay.
It's like there's gotta be more to you 

548
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:57,260
than that.
Everything's about like,

549
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:59,190
I drink matches.
I took a 10 inch cock.

550
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,080
It's like there's gotta be more to you 
than that

551
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,480
tube game that everyone's trying to play
now.

552
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,550
And like everything's got to be so crazy
like we used to.

553
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,743
Oh,
we did this video of tasting different 

554
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:15,200
sodas and weird flavors.

555
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,460
I forgot to tell you that one.
This is,

556
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,280
this is.
No,

557
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,133
it's like gotten this far.
It tasting gross sodas is not enough 

558
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:28,730
anymore.
Know what he should've done is be like,

559
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:32,110
this is a black guys or white guys is a 
vegans jazz.

560
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,460
Well,
it's not done.

561
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,820
You know,
I watched it all.

562
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,830
No,
and when the videos

563
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,040
five times because face right now.
All right,

564
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:46,690
well anyway,
well I'll have to bookmark of the.

565
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,070
My first time I took 10 inches for a 
related to Austin the other day.

566
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,523
No,

567
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,740
Tmi and I'll buy you.
Don't you only live once the bottom up?

568
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,583
No,
just kidding.

569
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,493
Okay.

570
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,653
He's not just kidding though.
He drinks it all like throughout the 

571
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:04,350
video when I saw that,
I was like,

572
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:07,520
oh thank God it's not.
It's actually just clickbait,

573
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,423
but I promise he drinks at all and I 
don't know if I even need to 

574
00:30:10,951 --> 00:30:12,550
necessarily.
Yeah,

575
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,280
I'll know.
I'll keep watching it.

576
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:15,114
I'll know when I've had enough.
You tell me when you're done watching 

577
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:19,770
this.
Okay.

578
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,210
Because I don't,
you know,

579
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,010
I'll shut up

580
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,100
obviously like I let the gait belt with 
a whole bunch of different guy.

581
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,700
Not a whole bunch what was making myself
sound a little sweaty,

582
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,570
but I feel that yeah,

583
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,060
holding a cup of your own ges and you're
about to drink it.

584
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:35,380
You don't need help.
Sonic slutty

585
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,910
meat eaters.
They're so salty,

586
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:40,744
which is weird because I um,
I eat a lot of salt but all my exes are 

587
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:47,081
like,
yeah,

588
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:48,700
you're really sweet tasting.
And I'm like,

589
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:51,700
how has that been?
Like I eat like 10 times as much salt as

590
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:52,534
you,
but I guess it has to do with like red 

591
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:57,940
meat consumption and all that stuff.
So they are always in that sense

592
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,150
you've had enough.
You will want to see him drink or should

593
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,510
we really?
It did it.

594
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,060
He did it here.
Let's see.

595
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,470
Let's hit a drink here.

596
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,940
Potent smelling like it kind of.

597
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,310
Oh,
he drank from already.

598
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:17,420
It looks like less and volume.
Oh,

599
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,563
there you go.

600
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,173
So I'm basically like,
well let's see what I smell like taking 

601
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,680
the sniff of his own kid.
Okay,

602
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,770
I'm getting late.
So let's hit the button on this.

603
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,240
You don't want to see him hit it?

604
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,570
No,
not really.

605
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,780
You don't want to see him throw it back 
a bit.

606
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,540
That people will see it.
Throw it back.

607
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,663
Yeah.

608
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,330

616
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:23,221
You're saying Yo,

617
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,550
I'm the.
I'm the Jew.

618
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:29,140
God of the intellectual dark web.
What is this?

619
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:29,974
Intellectual dark web.
It's like a collection of all these 

620
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,580
Jordan Peterson.
I'm finally and others and others.

621
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:37,414
So am I going to be inducted into that 
for my research into and we'll see more 

622
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:43,970
results you're bringing back.
When do your research.

623
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,790
How do we have any interesting calls yet
at the end?

624
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,593
Uh,
he's in the middle of screening right 

625
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:51,210
now.
Dan.

626
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,740
I don't think I'm logged into the call.

627
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,690
Oh my God.
I'll tell you right now.

628
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,420
Yeah.
You still looking for one?

629
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,300
Okay.
Next up

630
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,810
break.
Invasion is back.

631
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,090
He's dodging a lie.

632
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,770
I'm trying to get ahold of him and he's 
been dodging me a little bit.

633
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,840
That's okay.
Once I tell them I'm the Jew,

634
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:16,710
God,
he'll do a little bit more

635
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,750
today.
It's kissing plank.

636
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,980
I'm starting to like Chris mentioned a 
video gets a thousand thumbs up.

637
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,900
Six days.
Manager said six.

638
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:29,190
Nine.
Oh,

639
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,023
come on.

640
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,760
All the audio is like,
so people know what the hell are gone.

641
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,103
I panicked.
I thought it was high and but now that 

642
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,553
that's his style,
his style is like torn and destroy the 

643
00:33:41,351 --> 00:33:43,790
audio as much as possible.
They always take a decision.

644
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,773
I'm telling you,
watch his past 20 beers are all like 

645
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:47,390
peaked out of this planet

646
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,000
six,
nine edition.

647
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,520
If this video gets 100,000
thumbs up six days,

648
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,330
why is there a group of uh,

649
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,320
what's going on behind you?
What is it trying to look like here?

650
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,020
What is this?
So there's this rapper six nine.

651
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,213
Yeah,
I'll show you

652
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,223
six,
nine.

653
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,290
This guy

654
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,170
you've seen him.
He's a,

655
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,330
he's,
he's like a meme,

656
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,100
right?
Yeah.

657
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,173
Bed Six.
Nine will come on the guaranteed to get 

658
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:23,500
the most kids.
Try it.

659
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,210
Let's do it.
Alright.

660
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,580
So here's the game guys.
I have gotten

661
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,330
no word that if you can somehow smash 
100,000

662
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:34,550
likes on this video,
if we can get 100,000

663
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:35,384
live viewers right now,
prank invasion will come on the show as 

664
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:42,560
a guest and kiss me.
What if I kissed Chris?

665
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:44,690
Would that be shocking?
Would that be good tv?

666
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,463
Yeah.

667
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:51,550
If we do a quick video as if he comes in
here,

668
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,970
we kind of do need to play a quick game 
for a quick kiss.

669
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,970
Me and him.
Yeah.

670
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,210
No,
not me.

671
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,191
Not,
you know,

672
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:02,900
I went through.
I wouldn't volunteer for that,

673
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,090
but with you,
you're kind of damaged honestly.

674
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:07,924
Once you kissed Chris,
I wonder if we could also get a girl in 

675
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:12,610
here like act or.
No?

676
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,480
No.
Okay.

677
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,070
I'll do it.
I'll fucking do it.

678
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,000
I swear to God.
I'll do it.

679
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,830
I'll do a quick answer.
A quick kiss.

680
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:22,480
I swear to God and noises.
I'll do it dude.

681
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,343
You think I'm not?
I'll deal with this fully narrowed 

682
00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:27,640
asshole to me.
It would grab your ass.

683
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,800
Full Lynyrd.
[inaudible].

684
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,030
Sexy turn.
See how he pulls this girl at six.

685
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,873
Nine style

686
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,080
can sound like six.
Nine.

687
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,300
You got to give me a really,
really quick.

688
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:46,490
Hits your down.
Okay.

689
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:47,324
Here I go.

690
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,363
She's like,
Yup.

691
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,140
Nailed it.
She,

692
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,940
she,
I irresistible even trying.

693
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,020
And you know where it goes from here.
I got to say I love Chris.

694
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,410
It's getting to the point where it's 
just so good.

695
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,640
Is making parodies of himself at this 
point.

696
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,760
Yeah.
No,

697
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,623
it's turned.
It's really turning into something 

698
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:14,210
special.
We've got current events.

699
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:17,660
We've got everything to talk about 
everything going on in the world.

700
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:22,690
I'm going to tell you guys about it now.
Enter the current events experience,

701
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:30,970
drug overdoses up 10 percent and the US.
What is going on?

702
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,240
Well,
it's mostly from prescription drugs.

703
00:36:35,241 --> 00:36:38,480
Actually shouldn't really surprise 
anyone,

704
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,343
but I haven't been following the story.
And then here you can see by year at 

705
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:48,991
chart basically since 2016 and to this 
date it's shot up.

706
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,233
These are all synthetic opioids.
Basically pain prescribed prescription 

707
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:06,081
painkillers way worse than heroin.
Yeah,

708
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,193
like almost double that that if you go.
It's interesting if you go back to like 

709
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:11,370
2012,
2013,

710
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:18,180
it was the least deadly.
Although what's going on in the US,

711
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:21,750
if you go back to 1999,
people weren't really dying from drugs

712
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:27,020
but somehow unliked and turn the end of 
this century.

713
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:32,030
Everybody's what's going on.
People are profiting from it and heroin,

714
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,360
cocaine,
but it's like all going up.

715
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,990
Is this a cultural issue or is this.
Well,

716
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,470
you could,
you could say the,

717
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,460
the whole graph going up.
Maybe it's a cultural issue,

718
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:47,300
but yeah,
that one spike on the synthetic opioids,

719
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,880
right?
Is Not.

720
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,053
I am.
I am very curious about the cultural 

721
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:52,514
issue of why in the past 2015 or 15 to 
20 years or is everybody dying from 

722
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,270
like,
what the fuck?

723
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,070
I wonder if there's some explanation or 
visit.

724
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:08,960
Just life has become so unbearable.
You know,

725
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,470
it's like,
let's take away health care,

726
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:13,304
let's put everyone in that and let's 
just give them some opiates to fucking 

727
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:20,850
kill themselves on.
It's become a lot hard.

728
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,540
I'll tell you what.
Life's become a lot harder.

729
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,403
If you go back to 1999,
people could buy houses that could 

730
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:31,171
afford rent and over these past two 
decades it's gotten a lot harder to live

731
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:36,550
a lot more expensive,
blow harder to get medical treatment.

732
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,900
I don't know if that's a relation by.
That's pretty sad.

733
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,263
There's a bigger conversation here 
besides affect everyone's dying on 

734
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,150
opioids,
but that is the story here now.

735
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,350
I've been watching.
I just find it so ironic,

736
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:55,184
like let me open this again.
That there's this war on drugs like 

737
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,880
marijuana.
First of all,

738
00:38:58,881 --> 00:38:59,714
I'm not a marijuana user and I think 
that it's benefits and is greatly 

739
00:39:03,261 --> 00:39:04,094
exaggerated.
I don't think marijuana is an innocent 

740
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:05,834
truck,
but I do find it absolutely the 

741
00:39:08,331 --> 00:39:09,164
greatest,

742
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,433
probably the single greatest problem 
with our society is the fact that one 

743
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:19,300
percent of Americans are in prison,
most of them for harmless drug offense.

744
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,420
So it's like we're locking up marijuana 
users

745
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,780
and meanwhile

746
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,820
doctors and pharmaceutical companies are
openly poisoning people and I mean we're

747
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:34,770
talking about 30,000
deaths.

748
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,890
That's a small subset of people who were
addicted,

749
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,873
whose lives are being ruined because 
they're taking so many of these opiates 

750
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,223
and doctors are just giving them out 
like fucking candy because they're 

751
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:51,000
getting kickbacks.
There's like three big companies who are

752
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:51,834
distributed all this and they know 
exactly what they were doing and oh 

753
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,690
yeah,
that's just what it is.

754
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,090
We saw the 60 minutes,
um,

755
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,733
report about this,
how there was like little pain clinics 

756
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:08,910
opening up.
That's when we seen them.

757
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:10,020
I've seen them all over the place.
I'm like,

758
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:10,854
what is that pain clinic?
And apparently you can just walk in and 

759
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:18,100
a doctor will prescribe you a painkiller
and it's also predictive.

760
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,450
Don't give you anything.
They'll give you oxycontin.

761
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,560
They'll be any opiate,
any crazy shit you want.

762
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,423
Just be like,
hey my,

763
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,323
hey doc,
my back hurts and these crooked ass 

764
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,633
doctor,
they're just writing prescriptions all 

765
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,710
day long.
My Dad,

766
00:40:28,711 --> 00:40:29,544
he um,
he had like some arthritic pain in his 

767
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:33,144
wrist and this doctor gave him like an 
unlimited supply of like really intense 

768
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:42,150
painkillers.
And I was like,

769
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:46,440
Whoa,
like if he actually took kids so easy.

770
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,820
And I mean this is an ongoing issue.
It's not like a,

771
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,160
it's not like doesn't abilitative his 
life,

772
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:54,060
right?
He doesn't.

773
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:59,610
Nothing in my opinion that a little 
tylenol or Ibuprofen couldn't resolve.

774
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,940
But like,
that's insane.

775
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:10,250
That's so crazy what's going on there.
And anyway,

776
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,330
in the 60 minutes report that I hired,
they would come in.

777
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,533
They were showing how these huge 
pharmaceutical companies are basically 

778
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,423
con always lobbying congress to not 
enforce or regulate or control at all 

779
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,500
this,
this growing issue.

780
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,603
They showed like for example,
like there was one town like this is 

781
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:31,680
really ravaging like poor white 
communities.

782
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:34,190
It seems like in rural America,

783
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,520
like Arkansas and Alabama and 
Mississippi,

784
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,533
there was like a small town in 
Mississippi or somewhere that had 

785
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,124
imported so many and sold so many 
painkillers that it was something like 

786
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:53,430
50 pills for every resident of the city.

787
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,433
Hm.

788
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:59,650
Which means that they were probably just
selling it to drug dealers,

789
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:05,140
but like there's glaring problems here.
Have everyone dropped it like this,

790
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,860
this is,
this is so sick and,

791
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:08,723
and the government's not doing anything 
about it because there's so much a 

792
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:15,761
lobbying money and meanwhile we're 
lucking up marijuana users.

793
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:21,510
Yeah.
So that's pretty nuts.

794
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,470
That really grinds my gears.
You know,

795
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,870
I just hate this whole,
like moral.

796
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,490
There's always this moral argument from 
like army.

797
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,530
I mean,
Jeff sessions,

798
00:42:37,531 --> 00:42:38,364
the attorney general thinks that 
marijuana should be like a federal 

799
00:42:41,461 --> 00:42:42,294
crime.
Like he's staunchly against legalizing 

800
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,720
marijuana.
It's like,

801
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,760
okay dude,
what are you doing about this shit?

802
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,520
Like glad that you got your moral 
imperative about marijuana and,

803
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,393
and relatively harmless drugs.
What are you doing about this shit so 

804
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:06,110
twisted man.
Fucking can you believe that?

805
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,944
It's like Tiawana up there.
I've driven past few places when I'm 

806
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:12,020
driving around town.
You see like a pain clinic.

807
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,040
I was like,
what does that mean,

808
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:15,080
a pain clinic?
What do you,

809
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:15,943
what do you do there?
I never imagined that it was actually 

810
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:20,420
just people giving prescription drugs 
out like nothing.

811
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,333
I have no idea.
So I'm just writing what you were 

812
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:26,220
talking about and uh,
yeah.

813
00:43:26,221 --> 00:43:27,054
And like all of a sudden there is a 
small town and the pharmacy will be 

814
00:43:29,701 --> 00:43:34,410
buying 50 times the amount that a normal
pharmacy right is buying.

815
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,483
Yeah.
And it's like they're just turning a 

816
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:40,350
blind eye,
just letting it happen

817
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,100
because the pharmaceutical drug 
companies that are lobbying the shit out

818
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:47,720
of him and blocking it.
It's like congress is so twisted.

819
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:50,570
These guys are so fucking corrupt.
It's like scary.

820
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,000
Not to mention the,
that the water is turning frogs gay.

821
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,050
That's a whole nother issue.
Um,

822
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,520
do you want to talk about this airplane 
story Ilah or did we find it too little,

823
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:04,354
too sad

824
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,420
when you already brought it up?

825
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:09,210
Yeah.
Well,

826
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:11,640
come on.
Is this the video you put together?

827
00:44:11,641 --> 00:44:12,900
Where's the one you put together,
Dan?

828
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,383
The,
uh,

829
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,370
the edit,
it's a shared with you,

830
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,343
shared with me where here,
I'll drop it in the inner chat right 

831
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:25,230
now.
Um,

832
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,150
this story isn't weird and wild man and 
it's kind

833
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:34,140
of sad.
It's very sad.

834
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,960
I'm this guy,
I'm not sure how he even got in the car,

835
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,740
works in airplane.
Like how is it so easy to just,

836
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,950
there's no key.
You think he masterminded this.

837
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,140
It's not easy,
right?

838
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:49,463
Figuring out if this guy works at an 
airplane in Seattle and he just stole 

839
00:44:56,011 --> 00:45:00,360
the airplane and went for a joy ride,
but his intention was,

840
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,253
was to commit suicide.
And what's so intriguing about it is 

841
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:04,404
basically this conversation was recorded
between him and air control of air 

842
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:12,601
control.
Being like,

843
00:45:12,601 --> 00:45:13,440
hey man,
you know,

844
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,700
bring it,
bring it down.

845
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:20,800
And he's just,
he's just so casual about it.

846
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,630
It just seems like he's having a good 
time.

847
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,510
Uh,
Dan,

848
00:45:25,511 --> 00:45:30,511
I don't see it.
Just drop the Lincoln,

849
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,000
the,
it didn't work.

850
00:45:35,001 --> 00:45:36,740
I clicked it.
I think I need it.

851
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,570
But here I've got it in your email.
So here,

852
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,783
let's pop this up,

853
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:46,643
right?

854
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:49,840
Twenty one year old.

855
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,320
Hold on with me for a second.

856
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,040
So interesting

857
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:12,670
plane around.
You seem comfortable with that.

858
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:23,923
What's so crazy?
Is this what you guys are seeing as all 

859
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:30,110
footage people shop from the ground 
because this guy was like,

860
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:30,944
I'm going to try doing barrel rolls and 
all these tricks because his intention 

861
00:46:33,111 --> 00:46:34,860
was to die.
So he was almost just like.

862
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:38,500
But he was,
he was performing some pretty amazing so

863
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:42,140
being like don't want to hurt people on 
the street.

864
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:44,730
So he was also careful of that.
Yeah.

865
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:47,070
Really interesting.
No,

866
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:49,730
he definitely wasn't going to hurt 
anyone

867
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,653
and you can see all the terrain around 
and you've got no issue with visibility 

868
00:46:57,141 --> 00:46:57,974
or anything.
I got some gas to go check out the 

869
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:12,900
Olympics and rich are able to tell 
without the tutor at.

870
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,283
They're just not taking it's any jets.
I'm actually keeping you away from 

871
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:25,360
aircraft trying to land at Seatac,
you know,

872
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:32,620
screwing up everyone else's day.
Oh,

873
00:47:32,621 --> 00:47:37,621
hopefully went charter because it's 
going down jail time.

874
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,990
I mean I would hope it is for a guy like
me.

875
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,260
We're not going to worry or think about 
that,

876
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:55,620
but could you start?
I believe so.

877
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:00,650
I'm still working on an issue average.
Don't say stuff like that.

878
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,590
He better than trying to lay in it like 
I know how to put the landing

879
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:20,603
for the record.

880
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,320
Know.
I think it would give you pull this off.

881
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:36,290
You want it to land court field.
You wanted to try.

882
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:47,551
That might be the best way to set up and
see if we can land there because I don't

883
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,713
think I'd be happy with you.
The you that I did this year that I did 

884
00:49:00,141 --> 00:49:00,974
this.
I would like to apologize to each and 

885
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:09,611
every one of them.
I guess I never really knew it.

886
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,430
Alrighty.
Hey,

887
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,600
find the guy to a,
a,

888
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,410
a back flip ramp.

889
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,800
It's amazing.
But guys,

890
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,800
seriously shit.
You're fucking feeling bad man.

891
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,833
Definitely don't steal a plane,
but little followup to that somewhat 

892
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:56,130
depressing story.
This is charming,

893
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,330
charming stuff here.

894
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:02,130
No,
I'm just saying these guys are posing at

895
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:06,390
the same exact.
Are you serious?

896
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:14,340
Come on.
You gotta.

897
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,280
Love that.
They both.

898
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,390
Come on.
Give me a fucking break.

899
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,224
Would you?
Would you please give me a fucking 

900
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:22,194
break?
We've got a double proposal here at 

901
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:25,224
Disneyland for.

902
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,520
They're crying the freaking out.
That's at the magic castle.

903
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:33,440
Come on guys.
Give me a fucking break here.

904
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:35,750
We've got a double proposal.
Am I right?

905
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,870
This warms my heart.
I'm going to lie.

906
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:39,950
I said,
you know what?

907
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,060
He pulled the ring out.
You had to ring.

908
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,770
She was very cute about it too.
She was like,

909
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:49,330
I don't know what to do with.
Both of them were very much like,

910
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:50,603
hmm.

911
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,400
Love it.
So there you go guys.

912
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,510
We get it balanced.
We bring balance here on the HD podcast.

913
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:02,530
This is too much of a roller coaster 
peaks and valleys.

914
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,393
This I've told you,
this is the premier experience on the 

915
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:08,770
Internet today.
Maximum highs,

916
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:12,850
maximum.
Lowe's better help.

917
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,000
This one.
Okay.

918
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:21,200
We went from sadness to joy and now to 
rage.

919
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,810
This next story is really is really made
me rage full.

920
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,690
We were covering the whole spectrum of 
emotions here.

921
00:51:29,691 --> 00:51:33,560
We have some college before we take this
and let's get some serious.

922
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:34,680
Yeah.
Uh,

923
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,760
we got a few.
You want me to do a put one three,

924
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:37,160
right?
Yeah.

925
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:37,993
Yeah.
What's their name?

926
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,410
All right.
Let's see.

927
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,530
How do I do it?
Because I want to make sure that I can.

928
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,103
Uh,
I can shoot you the link if you want to 

929
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,870
right now.
Send me on discord if you would please.

930
00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:49,704
Okay.
Let me do one more story while you get 

931
00:51:51,351 --> 00:51:53,000
that set up in the backroom.
That sounds good.

932
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,170
You're like,
why don't you,

933
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:55,004
uh,
once you set me up an 87 year old woman 

934
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:06,850
gets tased while cutting flowers,
Dan.

935
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,970
All right,
thank you.

936
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,270
That's what we've got coming.
Shit doesn't work.

937
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,630
You know what?
Let's just says logged out.

938
00:52:17,631 --> 00:52:19,430
And this is a whole mess.
I mean,

939
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:20,730
how long is it gonna take.
What do we got it.

940
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,150
We got two seconds here on the clock 
guys.

941
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,133
Hope you're all doing good and having a 
great time here at the podcast 

942
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,510
experience.
We're logging into our call studio so we

943
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:34,310
can get the feedback of the geniuses,
frankly,

944
00:52:34,311 --> 00:52:36,290
that listen to the show,
the great minds,

945
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,390
the great minds out there that.
Listen to this show.

946
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,553
Dan,
how do you wipe since we've got your 

947
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:44,800
hair?
Uh,

948
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,670
I,
I do it the opposite of you.

949
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:48,250
Uh,
actually the norm,

950
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,180
what I would say is traditional.
Yeah,

951
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,320
you're,
you're a righty.

952
00:52:51,321 --> 00:52:52,760
I'm a lefty.
Let's be frank.

953
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:55,790
It's not that now,
do you go dry or wet?

954
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,580
I guess I go try.
I mean,

955
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:02,920
I feel kind of ashamed and,
and kind of ashamed of.

956
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:07,880
We shamed normal.
Which try a white ball now.

957
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:08,714
Dan,
do you ever feel that you just can't 

958
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:13,450
clean it?
Oh yeah.

959
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,310
Oh yeah.
And do you give up or do you wipe to the

960
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:17,144
point where it's like,
because usually with dry wiping your 

961
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,143
ass,
you come to a crossroad where you're 

962
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:21,614
like,
I give up too early or do I injure my 

963
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,530
anus?
So where do you,

964
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:26,490
where do you fall in that crossroad?
Yeah.

965
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:27,400
Um,
no,

966
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,851
I,
I've,

967
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:30,840
I've been there and it definitely,
it's a risky road.

968
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:32,370
I mean,
I can,

969
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:33,890
I'm like you.
I mean I'm,

970
00:53:33,891 --> 00:53:34,920
I'm,
I've got hair.

971
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,880
So,
you know,

972
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,410
it gets rough.
It gets real rough.

973
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:41,210
Sometimes you take the uh,
under wiping or the overwhelming,

974
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,333
I got to say I probably do the 
overwhelming because that's the other 

975
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:46,740
way.
It's not okay.

976
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,080
That's not tolerable.
So it's not really an option.

977
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:50,210
Not for me either.
No.

978
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,050
Have you bled from wiping?

979
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,850
It may be.
Maybe I probably don't check enough.

980
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,580
I'm a little like,
I don't know.

981
00:53:58,581 --> 00:54:01,050
I don't turn around and check out my 
business after.

982
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,960
I'm not ashamed to admit that I've,
I've bled from wiping.

983
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:08,460
I have,
I have to say what's going on here?

984
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,650
I've got to grab their password.
We this.

985
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:11,520
Uh,
we've,

986
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,520
we've distracted.
Then you've bled from wiping Ian.

987
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,860
Have you bled from wiping?
He said you now,

988
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:22,763
Dan,
you say May.

989
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,853
Probably.
Did everyone maybes an insufficient 

990
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:28,640
answer?
I don't.

991
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,300
I don't turn around and check.
Do you not look?

992
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:34,650
Every time you wipe,
do you look at what point do you look?

993
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,850
Occasionally you don't look.
You don't look at the last wipe.

994
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,660
How do you know your claim?
Oh,

995
00:54:39,661 --> 00:54:40,890
I see what you're saying.
Well,

996
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:43,261
yeah,
I guess.

997
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:46,230
I guess in that sense I do look yes.
But I'm not like taking.

998
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,820
Thank you.
Thank you.

999
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,630
I fully take it out.
I inspect it thoroughly.

1000
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,620
You have like a magnifying glass and 
they frankly,

1001
00:54:55,621 --> 00:54:56,490
I even looked,
I,

1002
00:54:56,491 --> 00:55:01,250
I generally even look at the first wipe,
right?

1003
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

1004
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,390
He lives with me.

1005
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,410
Thank you.
Now,

1006
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:08,244
Dan,
would you say that we all got our fresh 

1007
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,610
uniform and has your finger ever slipped
through the toilet paper?

1008
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,660
Because the what?
I mean the driver didn't know Dan,

1009
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,483
so yeah.
And then if so it's followed by like 30 

1010
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:27,600
minutes of scrubbing my hands 
afterwards.

1011
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,810
Good.
Alright,

1012
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,930
we're in.
Thank you Dan.

1013
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:35,590
Thank you for the anecdotes and fixing 
my computer and thank you to a thank you

1014
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,240
specifically to charms for the flushable
wipes.

1015
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,370
Oh,
I got to hear this.

1016
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:48,870
I'm kyle.
I don't know if you're on the air.

1017
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:52,170
Tell me about the.
Tell me about your life or not.

1018
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:55,770
I don't want to know everything but 
specifically about the lyme disease.

1019
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,250
Oh Man.
You Open?

1020
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:01,923
Yeah.
Let's,

1021
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,830
let's cut to the chase here.

1022
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:08,343
Yeah,
so I'm a geocasher or if you don't know 

1023
00:56:11,511 --> 00:56:12,344
what Geo caching is,
say a little like cps based treasure 

1024
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:16,124
hunt,
a scavenger hunt type game and a lot of 

1025
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,500
caching takes place out in the woods on 
trails and whatnot.

1026
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,820
So before I started this,
I was never a,

1027
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,310
never a hiker,
never spent much time outdoors.

1028
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:32,170
Um,
so I quickly learned that,

1029
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,293
you know,
you're on a trail for awhile sometime 

1030
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,900
nature calls and uh,
let me literally,

1031
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,130
and uh,
you know,

1032
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,400
if you're like a couple miles from your 
car or something,

1033
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,030
a couple miles from a restroom,
you just got to find a spot to take care

1034
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:47,540
of business.
Um,

1035
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,363
so,
so you had the first time that's 

1036
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:52,090
happened.
I'm a,

1037
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:53,340
I'm a,
I'm a hairy guy,

1038
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,080
much like you.
Um,

1039
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,680
so,
you know,

1040
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:57,514
it's not,
it's not,

1041
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,860
it's never good.
Never comes out clean.

1042
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:03,190
So the first time this happened I,
uh,

1043
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,110
you know,
you always hear this and I,

1044
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,760
I always thought it was Kinda like a 
joke,

1045
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,100
but I don't know if you always hear 
this,

1046
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:09,934
but yeah,
I use the least to kind of clean up the 

1047
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:17,371
business factor.
And a is not preferable,

1048
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,890
but I quickly learned because I mean,
as far as my normal wiping routine goes,

1049
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:24,080
I'm a dry wet guy,
so I'll go my first one,

1050
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,053
first one will be a toilet paper and 
then I got the baby was right by the 

1051
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:28,744
toilet that second.
And then I just kind of go back and 

1052
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:32,110
forth.
You kind of,

1053
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:32,943
it's a good way to kind of feel out the 
situation without having to inspect it 

1054
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:39,320
after every white because I,
you know,

1055
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,200
so let's.
So let's go to the,

1056
00:57:43,201 --> 00:57:44,930
the pivotal moment of the story.

1057
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,053
Yeah.
So,

1058
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:48,483
um,
this wasn't so on another occasion 

1059
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:53,030
because I started packing toilet paper 
in my,

1060
00:57:53,031 --> 00:57:53,864
like hiking backpack.
But on this one particular occasion I 

1061
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,400
had run out where I forgot it.
So I do not have it with me.

1062
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,640
So,
uh,

1063
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,120
you know,
I live up in Rhode Island,

1064
00:58:05,121 --> 00:58:08,210
we ticks,
ticks are very prevalent thing up here.

1065
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,370
And when did these as well.
So,

1066
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:15,760
um,
so I've never had an issue with ticks on

1067
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:16,603
my life,
but on this particular occasion when I 

1068
00:58:18,171 --> 00:58:20,000
popped the squat,
did my business,

1069
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:24,400
didn't have the toilet paper.
So I just did the leaf technique to uh,

1070
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,083
do uh,
you know,

1071
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,610
kind of take care of things a bit.

1072
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:30,500
Wow.
Did you get a tick on your penis?

1073
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:32,970
Not In my anus,

1074
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:38,070
but uh,
like two days later I felt something.

1075
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,813
I think actually I felt something in my 
groin area to say that I don't want to 

1076
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:48,830
talk about what I was doing.

1077
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:54,030
What were you doing when you noticed the
tick when you were jerking off?

1078
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:57,290
You said that

1079
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,123
Kyle,
Kyle,

1080
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:04,510
were you able to send it?
Did you finish when you,

1081
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,173
when you found the tech error or did you
decide to deal with it at the time or 

1082
00:59:08,821 --> 00:59:11,280
later?
That,

1083
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,350
that ruined the moment.
Yeah.

1084
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,260
I couldn't see what was going on.
I was in bed.

1085
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,620
Where on your groin was the tick 
located?

1086
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,430
It was like right

1087
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,930
in there.
Like I'm a big dude so,

1088
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:24,950
you know,
like I got some,

1089
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,980
I got thick thighs.
Sure.

1090
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:29,770
So,
so it wasn't,

1091
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:30,703
that's why I probably missed it because 
I always do like a check after it was 

1092
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:35,990
like,
um,

1093
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:39,200
like between the time it was deep,
it was like,

1094
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:40,140
it was,
it,

1095
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:43,080
it was in there and it felt like when 
you say deeper,

1096
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,670
was it under the balls?
Was it between the balls and the thigh?

1097
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,120
Was it next to the peanut?

1098
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,320
It was like,
yeah,

1099
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,470
in the ball between the ball thigh area 
right over there.

1100
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,500
That's how,
that's how I felt.

1101
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,770
I felt.
I felt that area.

1102
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:01,080
You might have been cutting your balls 
or something when you were jerking off.

1103
01:00:01,081 --> 01:00:01,914
Right.
To feel that there is something special 

1104
01:00:07,621 --> 01:00:12,621
for yourself,
you gotta treat yourself.

1105
01:00:13,171 --> 01:00:15,150
I totally,
definitely.

1106
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,133
Most definitely.
So what happens when you have a take 

1107
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,373
there?
What do you do?

1108
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:21,820
Good question.

1109
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:22,091
Well,
yeah,

1110
01:00:22,091 --> 01:00:22,970
so I mean,
you know,

1111
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,240
someone,
you know,

1112
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:28,360
you spend time hiking and whatnot,
especially around here,

1113
01:00:28,361 --> 01:00:29,530
you know,
you always hear about it.

1114
01:00:29,531 --> 01:00:31,420
So I mean,
I was freaking out,

1115
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:33,370
first of all because I never had a tick 
bite before,

1116
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,533
so I already knew the,
the way you want to get rid of it when 

1117
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:37,554
you want it,
when.

1118
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,220
Yeah.
So when you take it out,

1119
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:40,563
you don't want to like break the ticks 
body or leave that was in like 

1120
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,450
underneath,
like it's burrowed in the skin,

1121
01:00:46,451 --> 01:00:48,060
like some of it.
So did you,

1122
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,000
uh,
the techniques?

1123
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,090
I use tweezers,
pull it out and it,

1124
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,940
you grab it and then you rotate it.
Right,

1125
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:57,950
right,
right.

1126
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,190
Yeah.
And it was tricky and hard to see.

1127
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,750
I mean I started.

1128
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:04,143
Do you have,
do you trim your pubic hair or are you 

1129
01:01:05,741 --> 01:01:07,540
fully a bushed?

1130
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:09,860
It depends when

1131
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,710
at the time,
you know,

1132
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:12,460
and

1133
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,293
when it's um,
it was probably some Bush happening at 

1134
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:15,250
that time.

1135
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,620
Right?
So the visibility was low.

1136
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,290
Oh yeah.
There's a lot of bushwhacking going on.

1137
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:22,983
And so this,
this son of a bitch gave you lyme 

1138
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:26,434
disease.

1139
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,520
Yeah,
I started,

1140
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:31,610
wound really shitty,
horrible.

1141
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,730
And now it's like why am,
is a terrible thing?

1142
01:01:34,731 --> 01:01:36,620
I mean,
I don't have it as bad as some people,

1143
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:37,963
but it's kind of just with me now,
like every year this happened about 

1144
01:01:41,841 --> 01:01:43,310
three years,
two years ago maybe.

1145
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:45,140
And um,
yeah,

1146
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:47,560
so like once every,
you know,

1147
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,510
once or twice a year now,
like I was,

1148
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,353
had like really bad migraine,
like body aches just kind of shuts me 

1149
01:01:54,531 --> 01:01:56,810
down for like a day.
It's just like with me,

1150
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:58,510
even though I went on antibiotics and 
whatnot,

1151
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,860
it's just something that sometimes it 
gets rid of it completely.

1152
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:01,810
Sometimes it just lingers.

1153
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,650
So what is the kind of moral of the 
story?

1154
01:02:04,651 --> 01:02:06,610
I'm wondering,
don't,

1155
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,670
don't go out in nature.
The moral,

1156
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,080
the moral of the story is,
I'm not sure what,

1157
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:13,920
what does that mean?
What is the,

1158
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,640
what are we getting out of this?
Kyle?

1159
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:20,730
I'm not sure.
I was going down a different path that I

1160
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:22,830
was fucking Ian and then somehow we got 
on this story.

1161
01:02:22,831 --> 01:02:24,790
I liked it.
I got to tell you.

1162
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,420
Well I'm sorry you got lyme disease.
That's awful.

1163
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:30,960
But on the plus side,
I mean the masturbating probably was,

1164
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:36,590
was definitely worked in your favor.
And this time would have stayed longer,

1165
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,430
I would have been even worse off.
So really.

1166
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:41,010
So is that the longer that ticks in you 
the worst?

1167
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:41,844
The lyme disease?

1168
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:43,783
Yeah,
because I hadn't quite another time 

1169
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:47,840
like,
and um,

1170
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:49,303
I noticed,
I know for a fact I noticed it within 

1171
01:02:50,721 --> 01:02:51,800
like,
you know,

1172
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:52,634
an hour.
So it has for the most part people say 

1173
01:02:55,521 --> 01:03:00,521
it has to be in there for like 24 to 72 
hours for that to be a transmitted.

1174
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:05,620
I'm very glad it was in there for like 
two days.

1175
01:03:05,621 --> 01:03:09,610
So very glad you decided to masturbate 
that on that when you did.

1176
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:13,780
And I thank you for sharing that story 
with me.

1177
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,880
But I'm also curious,
what is it you said,

1178
01:03:15,881 --> 01:03:17,350
what the hell are you doing out in the 
forest?

1179
01:03:17,351 --> 01:03:18,400
You're looking for treasure.

1180
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,100
It's a game,
I guess hobby with my call.

1181
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:24,934
It's called Geo caching.
So basically what it is is someone like 

1182
01:03:29,651 --> 01:03:30,484
me or whoever else,
Geo caches hide the container somewhere 

1183
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,850
out in the woods or out.
So there's so many.

1184
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,700
I mean there are over 3 million of these
geo caches around the world.

1185
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:40,953
Basically people go look for them,
they use gps coordinates to find where 

1186
01:03:43,301 --> 01:03:44,710
they are.
Once you're in the location

1187
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,550
and then you have to try to find it.
Is it,

1188
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,470
is there something valuable?
Do you find what's going on in this box?

1189
01:03:51,471 --> 01:03:54,050
Is it other than just text with lyme 
disease?

1190
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:55,550
You know,
there won't be.

1191
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,123
It won't be.

1192
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:59,980
The rule is if you take something out of
it,

1193
01:03:59,981 --> 01:04:01,600
you're supposed to put something back 
in.

1194
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,333
Do you still.

1195
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:07,810
Sorry,
what was that?

1196
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:12,070
Do you still geocache for you?
God bless.

1197
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:15,920
Yeah,
it definitely has ruined being outdoors.

1198
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,490
I'm way more paranoid now.
Whenever I am out in the woods.

1199
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,880
I used to like pick check only whenever 
I got back to the car after I was done.

1200
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:26,630
Now it's like every

1201
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,060
20 to 30 minutes on the trail and like.
Let me check.

1202
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:31,063
Yeah.
Well thank you carl for sharing your 

1203
01:04:32,941 --> 01:04:33,774
story.
I hope this is a cautionary tale that 

1204
01:04:34,551 --> 01:04:35,384
everyone out there don't go outside.
I mean that's the moral that I pulled 

1205
01:04:38,221 --> 01:04:43,221
from this.
I don't expose you asshole to the.

1206
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,010
To the,
to the conditional.

1207
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,230
Right,
exactly.

1208
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,150
Keep your asshole clean and cover my 
dues.

1209
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:49,223
Kyle.
Thank you for sharing that wonderful 

1210
01:04:49,741 --> 01:04:52,860
story with us and I wish you all the 
best and I hope that lyme disease.

1211
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,040
Keep it.
Yeah,

1212
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:59,100
keep cash in my dog.
Okay,

1213
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,210
appreciate it.
Thanks guys.

1214
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,650
Always.
We always end with a wet.

1215
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:03,050
One minute.
Thank you.

1216
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,410
Wow.
That was an interesting man.

1217
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:11,760
We've got travis here who uses female 
razors for asshole shaving only.

1218
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:16,020
That's not that surprising.
The same says he's a sandpaper in.

1219
01:05:16,021 --> 01:05:16,854
What the hell is this?

1220
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:21,980
He's shaking his head.
No,

1221
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,191
he said.
He said,

1222
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:25,930
where's the box guy?
Is that guy still on?

1223
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:27,203
No,
I just see travis talking razors and 

1224
01:05:29,431 --> 01:05:31,480
John who saw the handover.
Oh,

1225
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:32,770
bummer.
While we can.

1226
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,530
That was a great one.
Happy with Kyle Up.

1227
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,593
This story mean it didn't.
It didn't really add to our knowledge 

1228
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:39,514
base,
but it was a great know if we can join 

1229
01:05:41,051 --> 01:05:43,650
the great minds.
He's not a great way to collect.

1230
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:46,480
I mean he's a poor minds collective.
He got on a Dick,

1231
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,880
but he's a great guy and he's a funny 
guy.

1232
01:05:49,881 --> 01:05:50,890
You know?
Interesting guy.

1233
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:54,240
Kept living you guys.
Never did the Geo caching thing that was

1234
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:55,130
like,
yeah,

1235
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,990
I went on a few of those.
We don't live in the house.

1236
01:05:58,991 --> 01:06:03,991
If you haven't got what it was big like 
a while ago.

1237
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,000
Have you done.
Have you ever done this thing of walking

1238
01:06:07,001 --> 01:06:09,820
outside?
Forget about Geo caching.

1239
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,990
That's way too high level.

1240
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:15,430
Wow.
Thank you,

1241
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:16,600
Kyle.
That was a great story.

1242
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,270
Damn,
you don't.

1243
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:19,600
I've got.
I've had a tick before.

1244
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,490
Obviously.
Maybe I have lyme disease.

1245
01:06:21,491 --> 01:06:26,491
Maybe that's why I'm so lazy when.
That'd be great to have an excuse now.

1246
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,110
It's dramatic,
man.

1247
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,670
It's awful.
Oh God.

1248
01:06:30,671 --> 01:06:31,504
It's a fucking little creature burrowed,
but lyme disease is more prevalent on 

1249
01:06:37,701 --> 01:06:39,300
the east coast.
No,

1250
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:40,400
you're.
You're good.

1251
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,420
Why do.
Anyway,

1252
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:46,220
Kyle love you.
Let's move on.

1253
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:50,030
I'm 87 year old woman.
Taste.

1254
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:55,190
Take the old bitch out is what I say.
She had a common.

1255
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:59,900
I love these stories about place.
Now let me.

1256
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,190
Let me.
Let me say this guy.

1257
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,610
I respect police officers or respect the
job.

1258
01:07:04,611 --> 01:07:09,611
I respect what they do,
but I have a lot of buts.

1259
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,113
First of all,
you signed up for a dangerous job and 

1260
01:07:16,401 --> 01:07:21,401
you're well compensated.
You can go work in a fucking cafe if you

1261
01:07:25,581 --> 01:07:29,670
don't want to be in harm's way.
Okay.

1262
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:34,310
Nobody asked you or forced you to sign 
up to be a cop.

1263
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,890
The same goes for the military and I'm 
sorry,

1264
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,170
but my opinions,
the right opinions,

1265
01:07:39,171 --> 01:07:42,350
and if you disagree with me,
you're just clearly wrong.

1266
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,420
Why do I first of all

1267
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:45,653
back when the story so people can join 
your 87 year old woman while cutting 

1268
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:54,240
dandelion?
There's no justification.

1269
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,510
I'm going to tell the story though,
but I'm on A.

1270
01:07:56,511 --> 01:07:57,340
I'm A.
I want to.

1271
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:01,060
I want to talk about the rant about the 
military.

1272
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,630
Oh yeah.
Let me just finish this one point.

1273
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:09,820
As you tried to save me.
Being in the military doesn't make you a

1274
01:08:09,821 --> 01:08:12,460
hero by default,
but thank you for your service.

1275
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,830
Thank you for your service.
You signed up.

1276
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:15,921
Did it?
Look,

1277
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:16,040
it's

1278
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,570
a risky job.
It's there.

1279
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:19,250
It's the first part.
You Go.

1280
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,400
You travel around with a gun and hostile
territory.

1281
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:23,234
Same with the.
You walk around with a gun on your hip 

1282
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:27,410
for a region,
it's dangerous and you signed up for it.

1283
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:28,363
It doesn't make you automatically a hero
and it doesn't mean that you have the 

1284
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:36,530
right to never be in harm's way because 
the police training in the United States

1285
01:08:36,531 --> 01:08:37,364
is basically if you are any risk shoot 
to kill deadly force when you're 

1286
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:44,504
confronted with the 87 year old woman 
with a steak knife in her hand that was 

1287
01:08:48,861 --> 01:08:52,190
used to cut dandelions,
which is adorable,

1288
01:08:52,191 --> 01:08:56,060
as fucking gets to make a salad for a 
husband.

1289
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:57,663
God.
So she's out there cutting dandelions 

1290
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:03,110
and the police,
first of all that she wanders across the

1291
01:09:03,111 --> 01:09:05,280
street,
she's probably a little,

1292
01:09:05,281 --> 01:09:07,400
uh,
she doesn't speak English and she was on

1293
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:08,930
some guy's property.

1294
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,250
She probably didn't know it was,
uh,

1295
01:09:10,251 --> 01:09:13,160
it was the ymcas or some shit or the 
boys and girls club,

1296
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,583
but they call.
She was probably a little dementia or a 

1297
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,460
little senile.
Right.

1298
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:19,820
So the guys,
cause I have a recording,

1299
01:09:19,821 --> 01:09:24,500
but he says she's over here with a knife
and she seems lost.

1300
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:26,510
That's why he called.
They're like,

1301
01:09:26,511 --> 01:09:27,920
is she trying to stab people?
He said,

1302
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:29,060
no,
she's not dangerous.

1303
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:31,430
She's not trying to harm anyone.
She seems lost.

1304
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,073
That's why he calls.
So the police show up with arms with 

1305
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:38,900
their guns drawn,
screaming,

1306
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,690
you know,
dropped.

1307
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,193
Can you imagine that?
A sweet old lady with the little like 

1308
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:49,420
steak knife cutting dandelions shredder 
was like,

1309
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:52,640
what's going on?
So I'm going to tase you.

1310
01:09:52,641 --> 01:09:57,290
Shredder looking intimidating like you 
cannot.

1311
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:01,700
You have to draw the line somewhere.
You're signed up for dangerous job.

1312
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:03,800
Okay.
You have to draw the line somewhere.

1313
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:04,723
If some 87,
that the choice between tasing and 87 

1314
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:13,631
year old woman and possibly receiving a 
knife strike from an 87 year old women,

1315
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:19,450
you have to weigh the severity of these 
two situations.

1316
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:25,370
Can you imagine this old,
87 year old too crippled lady,

1317
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:28,520
she's all fastigiate.
All of a sudden she's like,

1318
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:29,720
Oh,
I'm at 86.

1319
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:35,150
She's all strong and fast out to kill.
No,

1320
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:39,020
the training is fucked.
It's fucked.

1321
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:44,560
You are not entitled to a perfect 
harmless existence because you're a cop.

1322
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,830
You signed up for that job and I 
appreciate that.

1323
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,664
You're serving the community and you're 
doing this wonderful dangerous job that 

1324
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:55,700
somebody has to do,
but you could have gone,

1325
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:57,680
you know,
you could have,

1326
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,253
could have done anything.
I just feel like any normal person in 

1327
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:04,004
that situation would like.
The thing was that she was walking 

1328
01:11:07,491 --> 01:11:09,230
towards them when they said,
drop the knife,

1329
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:12,750
drop the knife,
drop the fucking dog.

1330
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:14,100
It's like if you were in

1331
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,960
that situation,
what will you do?

1332
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:16,803
You just,
you'll let her walk to you and you'll 

1333
01:11:19,501 --> 01:11:21,120
deal with it.
Don't draw guns.

1334
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:23,000
You put your down and say hi,
can I help you?

1335
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,870
You okay?
It's like an old lady.

1336
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,573
How about you just go and grab her hand 
and takes a knife out of her hand 

1337
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:30,630
because she's an 87 year old woman.

1338
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:34,810
How about you just do this?
Are you okay?

1339
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:39,580
Take one.
We'll shoot you bitch.

1340
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:42,403
There's a problem here guys.
There's a problem with our police 

1341
01:11:44,931 --> 01:11:45,890
killing people.

1342
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:49,050
She didn't die,
but

1343
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:50,323
okay.

1344
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:54,460
She doesn't rush to the store.
Spoiler alert either.

1345
01:11:54,461 --> 01:11:55,420
You ruin the story.

1346
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:58,423
Yeah.

1347
01:11:58,470 --> 01:11:59,850
That was a major question.
Should this.

1348
01:11:59,851 --> 01:12:00,684
After an officer in Georgia taste at 87 
year old woman who was cutting the 

1349
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:06,630
alliance with a knife,
Steve Lipson saw me.

1350
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:09,480
His take.
What's up for them?

1351
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:11,670
It your ass.
Imagine that.

1352
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:16,500
Imagine that.
Just look at her and so sad.

1353
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,450
She probably hit the floor like a bag of
dirt.

1354
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:24,210
She probably hit the floor like a bag of
dandelions.

1355
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:30,240
She probably got injured.
She got to fall in this age.

1356
01:12:31,831 --> 01:12:32,664
Yeah.
You don't heal very fast if you make a 

1357
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:35,620
price.
She's alive.

1358
01:12:35,621 --> 01:12:36,730
I mean frankly speaking,

1359
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:39,890
I mean God,
look at that threat,

1360
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:44,950
that menace to society.
Damn.

1361
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:49,460
She had a common woman is actually 
facing charges this morning.

1362
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:50,720
Oh,
that's the best part.

1363
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,610
I didn't even tell you the best part.
Well,

1364
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,800
I'll let them speak for it.
She's getting charged.

1365
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,473
It is.
This is a misunderstanding on so many 

1366
01:12:58,341 --> 01:12:59,174
different levels facing charges,
but she has a court appearance next 

1367
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:06,890
month,
this 87 year old grandmother who doesn't

1368
01:13:06,891 --> 01:13:07,724
speak English and is charged this 
morning with criminal trespass and 

1369
01:13:12,941 --> 01:13:14,210
obstruction of an officer.

1370
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,250
There's no kids around telling me she 
doesn't speak English.

1371
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:22,340
A worker at a boys and girls club in 
Chatsworth,

1372
01:13:22,341 --> 01:13:23,174
Georgia called police Monday after 
seeing her walking with a knife in a 

1373
01:13:25,881 --> 01:13:29,240
field on their property,
it turns out she lives across the street

1374
01:13:29,241 --> 01:13:34,241
and this from Syria was a steak knife 
and she handled it with your family.

1375
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,110
Exterior was a steak.

1376
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,070
It's attendance.
Just a regular knife.

1377
01:13:38,071 --> 01:13:38,904
Like a kitchen?

1378
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,660
Yeah,
no knife.

1379
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:44,020
And she was there picking Dandelions,
which your family explains was meant for

1380
01:13:44,021 --> 01:13:44,854
a salad for her husband.
Police say she even had a bag full of 

1381
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:50,320
weeds.
Even the worker who called nine,

1382
01:13:50,321 --> 01:13:53,650
one one that we'd deal,
bitches got.

1383
01:13:53,651 --> 01:13:57,850
We'd take her out,
sprinkle a little crack on her.

1384
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,670
She was mysteriously found with crack on
her.

1385
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,493
Okay.

1386
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:08,260
This 87 year old crack attic pulled a 
weapon with a bag of weed on set.

1387
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,083
Wasn't threatening.

1388
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:16,390
She came out with someone with a nice 
ride or did he just have it?

1389
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:24,820
Police arrived with guns drawn,
telling her to put down the knife,

1390
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:25,654
but say she wouldn't.
They say they even threw a knife to the 

1391
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:29,710
ground trying to explain.
Put down the night.

1392
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,753
She won't put the knife down.
They explained she wouldn't put the 

1393
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:35,054
knife down,

1394
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:39,750
got him

1395
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:42,000
thing.
What they wanted her to do.

1396
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:45,900
When she kept walking towards them,
they shot her with a stun gun.

1397
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:48,030
The police chief was there during the 
incident,

1398
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,310
deployed the Taser rather than using 
deadly force.

1399
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:54,630
He says his officer acted appropriately.
Her family says that her age,

1400
01:14:54,631 --> 01:14:57,180
the shock could have killed her.
She's recovering.

1401
01:14:57,181 --> 01:14:57,741
Um,
you know,

1402
01:14:57,741 --> 01:14:58,610
it's still little.
So Kyla,

1403
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:02,060
anyone.
Nobody should be tasered but especially.

1404
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:05,160
Well,
I mean if it's like a 30 year old man,

1405
01:15:05,161 --> 01:15:07,350
a young 18 year old man,
woman,

1406
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,033
sure protect yourself.
But I love that the police chief comes 

1407
01:15:13,921 --> 01:15:14,970
out and is like,
oh yeah,

1408
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,630
no,
they reacted perfectly.

1409
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,790
We endorse fully tasing grandma's 
children.

1410
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:25,680
Really?
If you're stepping towards us,

1411
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,910
we're going to take.
If you're walking away from us,

1412
01:15:29,911 --> 01:15:30,950
we'll still you.
Yeah,

1413
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,010
we'll take you in the back.

1414
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:34,943
MMM.

1415
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:41,530
A little sore from what?
She's gone through facing charges.

1416
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:42,423
And there's one thing we should add 
about that young man who was speaking 

1417
01:15:44,351 --> 01:15:45,790
out for the family.
Robin,

1418
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:50,970
he is the nephew of this woman and he's 
a former police officer and he says,

1419
01:15:51,401 --> 01:15:52,234
well,
he understands why the officers use 

1420
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:55,143
their taser.
He wishes they had used a little more 

1421
01:15:57,281 --> 01:15:58,250
common sense.
Yeah.

1422
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,560
Thanks for bringing that up,
Steve.

1423
01:15:59,561 --> 01:16:00,394
Very much.
Yes.

1424
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:04,120
The nephew said procedurally the 
officers did the right thing,

1425
01:16:04,121 --> 01:16:07,190
but it's kind of like being aware of the
circumstance

1426
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:10,610
procedurally.
It's all good,

1427
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:15,710
but it's like it's an 87 year old woman.
Love it.

1428
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,080
Yes,
and maybe it was a little tough.

1429
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,050
Sometimes everything is not exactly by 
the book.

1430
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,580
Well,
the best part she was being.

1431
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:24,443
She has to appear in court for like,
I'm cruising around with a knife now 

1432
01:16:28,351 --> 01:16:30,870
they're going to charge her to make it 
look all kosher.

1433
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:32,363
Like let's just,
let's not waste the justice system's 

1434
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:35,214
time either.
She's being charged with criminal 

1435
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:40,260
trespassing and obstruction of an 
officer.

1436
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:42,690
You've tasted her bro.

1437
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,153
So

1438
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:52,310
I was at.
Was that Rachel?

1439
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:55,003
You could say that pose revealed the UK 
that people want Edra Elba to replace 

1440
01:17:00,551 --> 01:17:03,430
Daniel Craig as double o seven James 
Bond.

1441
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:05,170
But here's the catch.
Isla,

1442
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,450
he's black.
Oh,

1443
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:14,000
he's a black man.
Apparently that's caused a lot of drama.

1444
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:19,001
People say James Bond has to be white.
Here's my take.

1445
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,380
You Want my opinion?
Isla [inaudible].

1446
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:23,453
You want to know?
You guys want to know how to feel about 

1447
01:17:24,751 --> 01:17:29,020
this.
I love it.

1448
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:33,790
I love,
I love address Elba.

1449
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,180
I mean people voted for it.
Well,

1450
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:38,900
what else do you need?
That's the best part.

1451
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:39,734
This was a public vote and the UK with a
list of five names and people voted for 

1452
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:47,960
Idris and I love that.
Now everyone's like,

1453
01:17:47,961 --> 01:17:49,460
oh,
you can't be bond because you're black.

1454
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:51,470
When I heard that,
I was like,

1455
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:51,990
Oh,
well,

1456
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:53,300
I love that.
Not,

1457
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:55,820
not even.
This is why I love this story so much.

1458
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,580
It's almost like heartwarming

1459
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:04,460
how much people haven't thought about 
race in this because when I heard that I

1460
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:07,520
was like this,
I just love him as an actor.

1461
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,620
He Suave,
he's cool.

1462
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:14,000
He's a bad ass ever since I saw him in 
the wire.

1463
01:18:14,001 --> 01:18:14,834
Then in love with him as an actor.
I think he's great and I think he'd be 

1464
01:18:16,881 --> 01:18:18,620
an awesome double,
like double o seven.

1465
01:18:18,621 --> 01:18:20,810
I thought it was great.
Um,

1466
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:26,630
but apparently a lot of people are 
unhappy with the,

1467
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,393
with the scoop.
In fact there's a video that some grown 

1468
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:34,010
man.
Was it you said Dan about it,

1469
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:39,230
about her or in general it's like,
well,

1470
01:18:39,231 --> 01:18:43,940
here this Guy James Bomb.
Let's watch this video first I guess,

1471
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:46,940
but let's see it.
Somebody made a really great point here.

1472
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:48,500
They're like James Bond,
English,

1473
01:18:48,501 --> 01:18:49,430
American,
Scottish,

1474
01:18:49,431 --> 01:18:50,390
Australian,
Welsh,

1475
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:52,370
Irish.
It's like,

1476
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:53,870
oh,
the other actors that played him.

1477
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:54,740
Yeah.
It's like,

1478
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,800
it's like he's an idea.
He's cool.

1479
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,330
He swapped,
he's a spy.

1480
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:07,570
He's a bad ass of all the things I think
about when I think of double seven white

1481
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,070
is not like number one.
Oh,

1482
01:19:10,071 --> 01:19:13,730
he's a white guy.
Double seven white.

1483
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:15,230
Cool.
Suave,

1484
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,380
like down at number 15 or something.
I don't.

1485
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,980
It's not on the list.
Right?

1486
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:25,510
You're like,
I think he had top.

1487
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:28,720
If you ask someone as right,
top 10 attributes of James Swan,

1488
01:19:28,721 --> 01:19:31,750
if you write what you're kind of weird 
white,

1489
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,080
make some great points.

1490
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:37,450
Also,
I love her intro.

1491
01:19:37,451 --> 01:19:40,510
As Dan pointed out.
To me the world is incorrect.

1492
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,610
Ah,
look at this.

1493
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:43,610
Everything is going

1494
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:47,270
right.
The stage is set.

1495
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,190
Hopkins world.

1496
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,040
No

1497
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,560
interests.
Elva you shot is really powerful.

1498
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:55,480
Why is it okay?
Here we go.

1499
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:56,463
Thanks.
Bond.

1500
01:19:56,650 --> 01:20:01,130
You will not be below seven.
You say it like you will not be like.

1501
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:04,510
Is that how do you.
Why are you so sure about that?

1502
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,553
Over dead body?
That's a how many tweets you put out 

1503
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:11,760
saying,
I'm Elba.

1504
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:13,043
Idris Elba.
It's not because you're a gentleman of 

1505
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:18,420
color.
It's because a gentleman of color.

1506
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:19,723
Hm?

1507
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:25,110
You don't like black people deal lady or
a gentlemen of Color.

1508
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:30,180
James Bond isn't.
He's written as an upper class.

1509
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:34,470
Our good white top form with a silver 
spoon in his mouth.

1510
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,210
Why can't that person be black?

1511
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,333
Do you hear what you're saying?
He's written as an upper class snobbish 

1512
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:42,380
silver spoon in the mouth.
Okay.

1513
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,420
Is that just white people?

1514
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:49,423
Okay.

1515
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:51,213
Shit.
By Eaton and Sandhurst and well 

1516
01:20:53,371 --> 01:20:58,371
connected by his Swiss family fought 
tooth and it's not about talent address.

1517
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:02,160
Many people love you.
I love how she's like ranting at him.

1518
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:05,460
It was asked to be included in this bowl

1519
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:10,470
and he just made a tweet joking about it
and now all of a sudden like he,

1520
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,333
he's getting shit for this poll where 
people made a popular vote that they 

1521
01:21:14,531 --> 01:21:15,520
would like to see him in it

1522
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:21,860
almost more than you do yourself,
but please can someone on your team come

1523
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:25,110
up with that own ideas or that own 
material?

1524
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,123
Must we perpetually crowbar in gender 
and color where it doesn't fit our 

1525
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:31,743
imagination.

1526
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:36,180
It wasn't his idea.
First of all.

1527
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:36,811
And second.
Yeah.

1528
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:37,644
It's like,
it's like she's the one crow barring in 

1529
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:45,030
race isn't a part of James Bond.
He's just a guy.

1530
01:21:45,031 --> 01:21:45,864
He's despised the coolest spot.
The fact that he's black is incidental 

1531
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:54,830
and he's British by the way.
He's got a cool slick ash British accent

1532
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,380
when I think James Bond British is what 
I think,

1533
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:59,060
right?
Not Black or white or whatever.

1534
01:21:59,061 --> 01:22:01,820
He's a British spy.
He's got a dope accent.

1535
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:03,890
That sounds cool.
He fucks like crazy.

1536
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:06,620
He's a bad ass spy.
And you look down the,

1537
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:09,530
you know that white snipey?
Yeah.

1538
01:22:09,531 --> 01:22:10,364
The sniper.
Can we stop making everything about 

1539
01:22:14,571 --> 01:22:19,571
race?
It's like no one was sounds good to me,

1540
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,233
man.

1541
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:30,270
Thing the way we love these characters 
maters as evidenced by the outrage.

1542
01:22:30,401 --> 01:22:33,220
When someone attempts to mess with the 
things we love.

1543
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:38,200
So you see address.
It's not about your color or you.

1544
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,870
It's about bond.
James Bond.

1545
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:44,613
How dare she say that?
I love what you're directing it towards 

1546
01:22:47,231 --> 01:22:47,681
him.
He's like,

1547
01:22:47,681 --> 01:22:51,640
what the fuck did I do as an actor?
It's some other thoughts,

1548
01:22:51,641 --> 01:22:56,641
but it's already been a long something 
about it.

1549
01:22:57,161 --> 01:23:01,530
You know?
I disagree.

1550
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,813
I think you'd be great and I hope he 
gets it and I'd like to see what going 

1551
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:08,260
to do about it.
You will not be James Bond.

1552
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:10,780
I like to see what you're going to do 
about it.

1553
01:23:10,781 --> 01:23:11,614
Lady.
Going to find the footage and just 

1554
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:18,620
destroy it.
Sounds like a threat does.

1555
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:20,740
I love this.
I love the term.

1556
01:23:20,741 --> 01:23:25,741
Gentlemen of Color.
Why do you.

1557
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:30,920
Why do you have to put it like that?
Just say black dude.

1558
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:34,400
It sounds less weird.
He's a gentleman of color.

1559
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:36,890
Have you met my friend Tony?
He's a gentleman of color.

1560
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:38,333
Be like,
what?

1561
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,251
That's weird,
dude.

1562
01:23:40,251 --> 01:23:42,920
Don't say that.
Oh,

1563
01:23:42,921 --> 01:23:45,080
the black guy,
excuse me.

1564
01:23:45,081 --> 01:23:46,790
They prefer gentlemen of color now.

1565
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,033
Okay.

1566
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,393
Evidenced by the outrage.
When someone attempts to mess with the 

1567
01:23:51,921 --> 01:23:54,230
things we love.
So you see dress.

1568
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:55,213
It's not about please don't attempt to 
thing and to mess with the things I 

1569
01:23:57,891 --> 01:23:59,150
love,
which is being white.

1570
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,910
Okay.
How'd I do?

1571
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:08,400
Did I get through that?
You need a writing up there every why?

1572
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,110
Yeah.
Guys,

1573
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:12,390
listen,
that's just my opinion.

1574
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,990
I don't think James Bond needs to be 
white.

1575
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,101
Oh,
she was saying,

1576
01:24:20,101 --> 01:24:22,500
wait,
where do I saw this one video of someone

1577
01:24:22,501 --> 01:24:27,501
saying that it was like as if a white 
person played a black role.

1578
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:30,110
What was that?
I didn't see that clip or what?

1579
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,800
What did I see that Dan?
I remember that too.

1580
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,720
It cracked me up.
I was just thinking the last,

1581
01:24:34,721 --> 01:24:35,554
a little chunk of that.
Did you finish out that there was this 

1582
01:24:37,421 --> 01:24:40,720
great clip that just had me rolling 
where she was like,

1583
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,280
what did I miss?
She says like,

1584
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,510
no,
that's like having a a what?

1585
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:52,460
That's like having a white person play 
coon to Kente from roots.

1586
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:57,190
That's about race.
Whereas explicitly about.

1587
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,570
That's about race.
It's not the same.

1588
01:24:59,571 --> 01:25:01,580
Get dumbed down.
Let me try to find it.

1589
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:04,550
I don't want to watch this video 20 
times though.

1590
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:06,483
A short

1591
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,870
Da.
We watched this short one on twitter.

1592
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,280
All right,
let's finish this.

1593
01:25:12,281 --> 01:25:13,061
Fuck.
Damn.

1594
01:25:13,061 --> 01:25:17,080
We watched the wrong one.
How could this happen?

1595
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:24,090
Why did this happen?
Oh Man.

1596
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:27,050
All right.
Let's pick up from here.

1597
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:32,100
The Cold War era,
and that's the glory of the thing.

1598
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:37,530
A throwback because James Bond isn't.
He's written as an upper class,

1599
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,293
are really good white top form with a 
silver well connected to play Winnie 

1600
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:50,093
Mandela.
How would the bender and color where it 

1601
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:55,830
doesn't fit and how come it doesn't work
the other way?

1602
01:25:56,250 --> 01:26:00,000
If I was to play Winnie Mandela,
how would that go down?

1603
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:01,043
She's accounting.

1604
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:03,650
I don't know.
Why would you even.

1605
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:05,450
Why would you want to play?
Man?

1606
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,160
I didn't know what she's talking about.
It looks like she's like,

1607
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:10,130
what if I played a black slave?
How would that go down?

1608
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,553
Pretty bad because it's about race.
James Bond has nothing to do about race 

1609
01:26:16,311 --> 01:26:21,311
and power and identity and she's talking
about the wife of Nelson Mandela,

1610
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:26,860
so it's like explicitly about apartheid.
It's a fictional character that's a real

1611
01:26:27,861 --> 01:26:32,861
person that's black about apartheid.
And what if I played Hitler and a film,

1612
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:42,680
I think I would have said a lot of white
supremacists and that's just not right.

1613
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:47,740
Frankly.
I'm seeing as a cow what's the issue and

1614
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,620
if they cost money and I can watch her 
anymore.

1615
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:53,000
Oh,
white shaft,

1616
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:54,770
bitch.
Shut the fuck up.

1617
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:01,160
Shaft was a film.
I don't need to Belabor this anymore.

1618
01:27:01,161 --> 01:27:04,100
I think we get it right.
I played the wrong one.

1619
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,800
I would like to see.
Uh,

1620
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:08,480
would you watch white shaft dealer?

1621
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:13,080
I actually don't know.
I don't know if everything.

1622
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:16,020
Chef,

1623
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,340
what is the chef?
Sick.

1624
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:22,290
Let's move on.
Grand jury.

1625
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:23,760
Oh God.
Not this one.

1626
01:27:25,050 --> 01:27:27,210
We can skip because there was a lot of 
stuff.

1627
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:29,340
Grand jury report.
No.

1628
01:27:29,341 --> 01:27:31,500
Ila.
Our duty is to report the news.

1629
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:32,663
We are here to report current events and
news and culture and to tell you guys 

1630
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:42,120
how to think and feel.
Grand jury report,

1631
01:27:42,121 --> 01:27:42,954
Catholic priests ran a child porn ring 
and six Pittsburgh basically throughout 

1632
01:27:52,391 --> 01:27:53,710
Pennsylvania.
This,

1633
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:58,090
this is shocking to me.
I guess.

1634
01:27:58,091 --> 01:28:00,160
Let's start with this video.
This is horrifying.

1635
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:02,260
Wait,
is this it here?

1636
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:03,723
Yeah.

1637
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:11,210
Now this is.
This is just plain evil.

1638
01:28:11,211 --> 01:28:12,210
I mean,
I don't really know what.

1639
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:14,900
How else would you describe this and 
Pennsylvania?

1640
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:18,410
There is an epidemic,
an actual pedophile ring.

1641
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,940
Okay.
I've just 300 priests.

1642
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,070
I don't know how many priests are in 
Pennsylvania,

1643
01:28:25,071 --> 01:28:27,220
but I can't imagine more than like a 
thousand.

1644
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,133
I mean,
I don't know what's the number but what 

1645
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,670
does that.
What does that 30 percent.

1646
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:33,793
That's a whole state and it just.
It kinda pisses me off because you're 

1647
01:28:39,501 --> 01:28:42,610
seeing a lot of people.
All these conspiracy theories about like

1648
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:48,070
satanic pedophile rings like this q and 
on and pizza gate and all this shit.

1649
01:28:48,711 --> 01:28:52,310
Alex Jones goes off.
He says the world is run by pedophiles,

1650
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:57,140
Bro.
Look at your own fucking church.

1651
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:00,800
This is the most evil shit I've ever 
heard in my life.

1652
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:02,893
Yeah.
How can you talk about pizza gate when 

1653
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:10,970
the Catholic church is literally a safe,
Tannic Colt?

1654
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:18,900
When you have 300 priests systematically
abusing kids and Pennsylvania,

1655
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,550
everybody in that organization knows 
it's happening.

1656
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:27,670
Everybody,
the priests,

1657
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,780
the that's part of the story is that 
they were covering up flat.

1658
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,810
How are they?
I and I'm,

1659
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,040
am I supposed to believe that they're 
not all participating?

1660
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:38,653
How can you let that evilness slide in 
the church like their whole thing is 

1661
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:49,541
community and serving God and like,
and so how am I supposed to believe that

1662
01:29:50,121 --> 01:29:50,954
over the course of many decades,
you can have that many pedophile 

1663
01:29:56,661 --> 01:29:57,494
priests.
You're covering up and you're moving 

1664
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:04,001
them around and you're not all in on it.
Not just covering it up.

1665
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:07,400
Who is all in on it?
Everybody.

1666
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:11,690
What do you mean everybody?

1667
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:16,970
If 30 percent of the people that work 
for you or fucking kids,

1668
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:18,670
like what?
What?

1669
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,590
What reason do you have to keep that 
system moving?

1670
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:25,550
If you find a pedophile,
you kick come out and you'll apologize.

1671
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:27,530
When you have 300 and you're covering 
up,

1672
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:32,300
you're perpetuating a system that you 
probably want to keep going.

1673
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:34,063
I think there's a lot more of these guys
fucking kids than just the 300 and it's 

1674
01:30:40,491 --> 01:30:45,430
just so funny and ironic to me that 
people will go slander and end date,

1675
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:48,820
say dangerous shit like pizza gate and 
um,

1676
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:52,250
basically make up stuff and on and all 
this shit.

1677
01:30:52,251 --> 01:30:53,084
Say Obama is a pedophile when you have 
this like an and the shit that you're 

1678
01:30:57,651 --> 01:30:59,320
going to hear is going to make your 
sprinkler.

1679
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:04,330
I mean this is really evil stuff.
So just prepare for them.

1680
01:31:05,661 --> 01:31:10,661
And this is shocking.
Do I sound like a conspiracy theorist?

1681
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:15,090
But I'm basing it on something.
Well,

1682
01:31:15,091 --> 01:31:16,230
I'm not sure.
What are you?

1683
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,880
Everybody's in on it.
Nobody.

1684
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:21,420
The fucking.
Everybody.

1685
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:23,880
The whole church.
Not the,

1686
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:25,650
not the people,
not the congregation,

1687
01:31:25,651 --> 01:31:29,840
but like all the priests,
the bishops know the pope,

1688
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:32,550
the pope.
People were saying,

1689
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:34,590
what was the last pope the resigned that
never happened.

1690
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:38,160
People speculate that he was fucking 
kids and he didn't want it to come out.

1691
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:43,640
Imagine the pope is raping children and 
you're talking about pizza gate.

1692
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:47,583
What do you really see?
That it makes me think I do really care 

1693
01:31:50,021 --> 01:31:52,510
about kids,
or is it just a political attack?

1694
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,620
Yeah,
dude,

1695
01:31:55,240 --> 01:32:00,190
this shit is so upset about child sex 
abuse by

1696
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,023
priests.
It found credible allegations exist 

1697
01:32:03,011 --> 01:32:03,844
against more than 300 priests and that 
more than 1000 child victims were 

1698
01:32:08,051 --> 01:32:12,250
identifiable.
What is worse because of lost records or

1699
01:32:12,251 --> 01:32:13,084
fear of coming forward,
it is likely the true number of victims 

1700
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,620
is deep into the thousands of Jean 
[inaudible] has been working on this for

1701
01:32:19,621 --> 01:32:20,454
us and gene.
Tens of thousands more massive 

1702
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:25,160
investigation.
Yeah,

1703
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:28,240
and it was with countless numbers of law
enforcement,

1704
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:30,880
prosecutors,
other attorneys within the office of the

1705
01:32:30,881 --> 01:32:34,540
attorney general,
and of course the grand jurors officials

1706
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:36,940
are saying that this report is the 
largest,

1707
01:32:36,941 --> 01:32:37,774
most comprehensive document into child 
sexual abuse within the Catholic Church 

1708
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:44,140
that has ever been produced in the 
United States.

1709
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,273
This report took two years.
It was written by 23 Pennsylvania Grand 

1710
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:53,470
Jurors who listened to dozens of witness
testimonies and witnesses.

1711
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:57,910
You're studying documents about alleged 
child sex abuse in six dioceses,

1712
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,360
which involved 54 of Pennsylvania,
67 counties.

1713
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,493
The report states that the testimony was
heard from dozens of witnesses and half 

1714
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:08,440
a million pages of internal documents 
were subpoenaed.

1715
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:09,753
It also states that they were credible 
allegations found against over 300 

1716
01:33:13,061 --> 01:33:13,894
priests.
Over 1000 child victims were 

1717
01:33:15,671 --> 01:33:16,504
identifiable,
but it's believed that the true numbers 

1718
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:23,230
are way more,
way more to the victims were boys,

1719
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:26,920
but girls were also victims.
Some routines,

1720
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:27,813
some are younger,
some were manipulated with alcohol or 

1721
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:31,444
pornography.
They were raped in various forms and 

1722
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:35,074
fashions and grand jurors found the 
church leaders in every part of the 

1723
01:33:37,721 --> 01:33:38,554
state preferred to protect the abusers 
and their institution above everything 

1724
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:44,284
else,

1725
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:48,660
every part of the state,
every part of the institution,

1726
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:50,243
every single time that's a church policy
to protect the institution at the cost 

1727
01:33:57,470 --> 01:34:02,010
of the abusers,
perpetuating a system.

1728
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:07,680
It's basically.
What exactly does the Catholic Church do

1729
01:34:07,681 --> 01:34:12,450
at separate kids?
I mean,

1730
01:34:12,451 --> 01:34:15,210
what exactly would you say you do?
Catholic church.

1731
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:19,860
Are you enjoying that tax exemption?
I'm,

1732
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,450
I mean,
I'm disgusted.

1733
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:24,870
I'm repulsed.
Like I think it's time to close it down.

1734
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,900
I think it's time to lock shop up on 
that church.

1735
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:31,260
Imagine any other.
Fucking.

1736
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:33,840
I mean,
I'm really upset,

1737
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,750
imagined scientology.
I mean,

1738
01:34:36,751 --> 01:34:38,290
which I fuck.
Imagine eyes.

1739
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:40,860
Imagine any organized religion being 
like,

1740
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:41,611
Oh yeah,
sorry,

1741
01:34:41,611 --> 01:34:45,540
we raped all your kids.
You need to imagine what scientology.

1742
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:49,170
Yeah,
but I'm saying if imagined this scope of

1743
01:34:49,171 --> 01:34:51,810
like all the kids are being raped and 
scientology.

1744
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:53,220
Yeah.
Watch day.

1745
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:56,460
Any serious bad example?
Imagine.

1746
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:57,383
Yeah.
Okay.

1747
01:34:57,410 --> 01:35:00,200
Example,
they're are all fucked up,

1748
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:06,190
but what exactly do they do there?
Why are we giving them a tax exemption?

1749
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:09,930
Okay,
this is evil.

1750
01:35:09,931 --> 01:35:12,210
You guys.
This is just actual evil.

1751
01:35:12,211 --> 01:35:13,044
It's like like all the weird 
conspiracies you hear about pizza gate 

1752
01:35:18,141 --> 01:35:21,710
and like weird child sex torture and 
pain.

1753
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:24,800
Basements is happening in the Catholic 
church.

1754
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:29,170
I like to hear this because the coverup.
What's most important goal

1755
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:33,260
these petitioners

1756
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:36,070
is Alex Jones ranting about this.
I don't know.

1757
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:37,600
Maybe he is.
I hope he is.

1758
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:39,400
That'd be pretty weird.
If he wasn't.

1759
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:43,420
I didn't know how you can bring up pizza
or cuing on and not this all day.

1760
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,610
I'm now.
You can't talk about this all day if you

1761
01:35:45,611 --> 01:35:46,510
care about pedophilia,

1762
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:53,150
and for a time some of the diocese 
sought to prevent the entire report from

1763
01:35:55,081 --> 01:35:58,800
ever seeing the light of day.
In effect,

1764
01:35:58,860 --> 01:35:59,693
they wanted to cover up the cover up.
They sought to do the same thing that 

1765
01:36:04,411 --> 01:36:09,030
senior church leaders in the diocese we 
investigated have done for decades,

1766
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:14,810
burry the sexual abuse by priests upon 
children and cover it up forever.

1767
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,970
The report states that because of the 
cup,

1768
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:19,130
okay,
I'll let me.

1769
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:22,880
Almost all of the abuse is too old to be
prosecuted.

1770
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:23,993
The Orange has issued present moments 
against two priests who was out of the 

1771
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,760
300,
300.

1772
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:30,913
They're only,
they covered it up for so long that 

1773
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:35,534
these guys have passed the statute of 
limitation and can no longer be charged 

1774
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:41,270
extra for two.
I mean,

1775
01:36:41,271 --> 01:36:43,880
that's a criminal organization that 
knows what it's doing.

1776
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:45,320
Folks.
Right?

1777
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:48,920
Round of applause to these guys.
Let's give them tax exemption.

1778
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,140
Let's make sure they never have to pay 
taxes.

1779
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,320
Um,
it gets crazier here.

1780
01:36:54,321 --> 01:36:56,180
I'm going to read some facts here.
I've got about this.

1781
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:00,673
This is a quote from one of the victims,
George claims that the priest began 

1782
01:37:05,661 --> 01:37:10,260
taking photos of him on a camera.
All the priest giggled,

1783
01:37:10,290 --> 01:37:12,750
so there's many priests involved in this
one location.

1784
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,110
Then added photos of him to a collection
of other teen boys.

1785
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:17,213
According to the grand jury,
these men and another priest who were 

1786
01:37:19,111 --> 01:37:22,170
part of a ring of predatory priests that
raped children,

1787
01:37:22,171 --> 01:37:23,004
shared intelligence of potential victims
and manufacturer child pornography and 

1788
01:37:27,871 --> 01:37:32,520
parishes and rectories.
This group of priests used whips,

1789
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:33,533
violence and sadism and raping their 
victims reads one line and nearly 900 

1790
01:37:38,821 --> 01:37:40,290
pages of documents.

1791
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:49,330
Hello.
Is the whole world talking about this?

1792
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,880
I mean,
I know people are talking about it,

1793
01:37:56,881 --> 01:38:01,800
but Dan just looked.
He said nothing on info wars about it.

1794
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:04,230
I mean the stories a couple of days old,
but like,

1795
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:09,390
hello.
This is kind of insane you guys.

1796
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:13,050
Yeah,
and this isn't just the United States.

1797
01:38:13,051 --> 01:38:17,850
There's crazy in Argentina and Ireland.
This,

1798
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:19,950
I mean there was huge stories about 
child abuse.

1799
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,940
It's like pedophiles are literally just 
joining the organization.

1800
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:31,223
We shocked sadism,
whips and violence and sadism and 

1801
01:38:35,751 --> 01:38:37,520
raping,
systematic raping.

1802
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:39,493
What I wonder if I'm religious people 
after hearing this would still send 

1803
01:38:44,151 --> 01:38:47,600
their kids do whatever it is they're 
sending them to.

1804
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,310
I don't know.
It's a good question.

1805
01:38:49,370 --> 01:38:54,370
It's the Catholic Church.
I mean the Catholic Church.

1806
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:56,673
The pope,

1807
01:38:58,040 --> 01:38:58,873
right?

1808
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,700
Where does the buck stop?

1809
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:05,960
Where does the buck stop?
Who's taken responsibility for this?

1810
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:07,043
Are we as a society taking 
responsibility for this that our kids 

1811
01:39:09,261 --> 01:39:12,560
and our citizens and our fellow,
our fellow citizens,

1812
01:39:12,561 --> 01:39:17,561
our children are being raped and the 
guys who did it are being covered up for

1813
01:39:20,601 --> 01:39:21,434
so long that they can't even be charged.
These guys are chilling dude there at 

1814
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:32,060
our local parks and I'm not and I'm not 
and I'm being serious sin.

1815
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:35,150
What was the.
What was I saying earlier?

1816
01:39:35,151 --> 01:39:38,690
Serious as what?
As a school shooting.

1817
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,640
I forgot what it was.
Thank you.

1818
01:39:43,641 --> 01:39:48,641
Dan.
This world is so fucked you guys.

1819
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:50,263
Why are we not pizza gate?
We have so if you imagine being this 

1820
01:39:56,001 --> 01:39:56,834
fucked there,
there was a email about a handkerchief 

1821
01:39:59,901 --> 01:40:03,230
with a pizza and upside down.
It looks like a pedophile.

1822
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:08,180
Are you fucking kidding me?
Let me read this again.

1823
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:09,223
The group of priests use whips,
violence and sadism and ripe raping 

1824
01:40:12,201 --> 01:40:17,201
their victims,
but at the the handkerchief upside down,

1825
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:21,770
why aren't you talking about this 
genius?

1826
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,260
You don't need any more fucking 
evidence.

1827
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:34,010
My skin is crawling and there's more in 
the details of what they've done is.

1828
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:39,300
It's horrible.
It's just horrible to read.

1829
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,400
The report said that meant here.
This is.

1830
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:45,270
This is so fucked.
If you could top sadism,

1831
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,370
I mean this is part of the sales 
reports,

1832
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:51,690
said that the priests gave a specific 
gift to children.

1833
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:54,010
They favored something they

1834
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,700
could wear that would mark them as prime
targets for abuse.

1835
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:00,640
He said,
they told me that they,

1836
01:41:00,641 --> 01:41:03,850
the priests would give their boys their 
altar boys or their favorite boys.

1837
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:05,120
These crosses.
He.

1838
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,093
George told the grand jury,
so he gave me a big gold cross to where 

1839
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:10,743
that Mark Timm,
so all the other priest knew he was 

1840
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:14,980
fair.
Game for abuse.

1841
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:18,760
Can I get another?
Look at that handkerchief.

1842
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:26,590
There's no need for conspiracy as guys.
This is as fucked as anything.

1843
01:41:28,711 --> 01:41:29,544
Your imagination can comprehend.
Almost every instance of abuse we found 

1844
01:41:34,721 --> 01:41:35,554
is too old to be prosecuted.
Here's some more highlights and 

1845
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,970
greenboro priests impregnated a 17 year 
old girl,

1846
01:41:43,150 --> 01:41:43,983
fortunate pasture signature on a 
marriage certificate and divorced the 

1847
01:41:46,481 --> 01:41:49,860
girl months later,
another precinct,

1848
01:41:49,861 --> 01:41:50,694
Greensboro groomed middle school 
students for sex according to the grand 

1849
01:41:53,461 --> 01:41:54,294
jury by telling them that Mary had to 
bite off the cord and the lick Jesus 

1850
01:41:58,921 --> 01:42:03,921
clean after the activity.
Well,

1851
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:08,220
what does q and have to say about the 
fuck?

1852
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,330
Well,
nevermind this.

1853
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:10,620
I can't wait to see what,
what,

1854
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,513
what?
Obama and George Bush and Bill Clinton 

1855
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:19,730
and Hillary Clinton.
Let's hear more about their sex ring and

1856
01:42:25,521 --> 01:42:26,354
Harrisburg.
A priest abused five sisters from the 

1857
01:42:28,401 --> 01:42:30,650
same family and collected samples of the
urine,

1858
01:42:30,651 --> 01:42:32,090
pubic hair and menstrual blood.

1859
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:36,530
This is like you've seen that show,
true detectives.

1860
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:39,350
How it's like so sick and twisted beyond
imagination.

1861
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:42,710
This is real.
Nothing.

1862
01:42:42,711 --> 01:42:45,470
Yet.
You know the.

1863
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:50,660
The phrase stranger than fiction can't 
make this shit up and Harrisburg.

1864
01:42:56,961 --> 01:42:57,794
A priests raped a seven year old girl 
who was in a hospital after her tonsils 

1865
01:43:01,450 --> 01:43:06,450
were removed and Pittsburgh.
This.

1866
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,540
This is just the highlights that they 
got,

1867
01:43:09,410 --> 01:43:12,260
and this is just one state,
one area,

1868
01:43:12,650 --> 01:43:13,483
and Pittsburgh Church church officials 
said that a 15 year old boy pursued and 

1869
01:43:17,241 --> 01:43:21,650
literally seduced a priest,
church officials.

1870
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:22,603
That was their statement and the fence 
of the priest that a 15 year old boy 

1871
01:43:27,351 --> 01:43:31,190
pursued and literally seduced a priests.
Well,

1872
01:43:31,191 --> 01:43:32,024
I guess that clears that up.
A church report later acknowledged that 

1873
01:43:35,601 --> 01:43:36,434
the priest had admitted to Sado 
masochistic activities with several 

1874
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,230
boys.
Are you sick yet?

1875
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:51,830
Yes.
I feel that people about this.

1876
01:43:51,831 --> 01:43:53,210
Everyone's just like,
oh man,

1877
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:58,640
there it goes to Catholic church again.
I'm ready to lock it up.

1878
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:02,720
I don't think these guys,
their library card is being revoked.

1879
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:11,240
What's going on?
This is the most evil shit I've read,

1880
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:12,553
and allentown a preset admitted sexually
molesting a boy and pleaded for help 

1881
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,013
according to documents,
but was left in ministry for several 

1882
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,320
more years.
Priest rapes a child.

1883
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,740
He begs for help and they leave them 
there for several more years.

1884
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:31,853
Hmm.

1885
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:34,500
It's just,
it's so horrible.

1886
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:37,680
And so how do you.
Even when you even say

1887
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:39,043
what I want to see action,
because we've been talking about this 

1888
01:44:44,791 --> 01:44:49,791
shit for like decades and it's just 
getting worse and worse here.

1889
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,200
This is a wonderful one.
And Alan's town,

1890
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:57,960
a priests who had abused several boys.
According to the grand jury,

1891
01:44:58,140 --> 01:45:02,490
was given a recommendation to work at 
Disney world by the church.

1892
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:10,500
They conveniently left out the part 
where he was a convicted a child rapist.

1893
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:14,030
Would this priest be good?
Uh,

1894
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,210
can we get a reference for his job at 
Disneyland?

1895
01:45:16,211 --> 01:45:17,800
He's going to be in a mickey mouse 
outfit,

1896
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:20,170
taking photos with kids.
Great Guy.

1897
01:45:20,530 --> 01:45:22,330
Loves kids.
Really?

1898
01:45:22,331 --> 01:45:24,280
Really loves kids.
Great with kids.

1899
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,980
Highly recommend.
Well,

1900
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:29,500
and he wasn't convicted,
right?

1901
01:45:29,710 --> 01:45:30,430
None of these guys.
Well,

1902
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:32,110
the church knew,
right?

1903
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:32,671
No,
no,

1904
01:45:32,671 --> 01:45:33,504
no,
no.

1905
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:34,840
That's too old,
right?

1906
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:37,160
And Scranton.
Isn't that where the office is?

1907
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:41,760
Sure.
Is the electric city a pre?

1908
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:42,673
Oh,
like God.

1909
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:44,773
A praise to was later.
Serve prison time for abusing children 

1910
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:50,830
was found to have been HIV positive for 
years.

1911
01:45:51,690 --> 01:45:54,970
Like he would fucking care.
According to CBS,

1912
01:45:54,971 --> 01:45:55,804
uh,
Pennsylvania grand jury report 

1913
01:45:56,210 --> 01:45:57,043
investigating the matter of states,
the church officials gave a former 

1914
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:01,630
priest a positive reference to work at 
Disneyland,

1915
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:02,673
even though officials field at at least 
one allegation about a sexual abusing a 

1916
01:46:05,211 --> 01:46:06,044
boy.
The report says he worked at the theme 

1917
01:46:07,721 --> 01:46:10,480
park for 18 years,
driving the train to the magic kingdom.

1918
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:11,590
Well,
isn't that a nice,

1919
01:46:11,591 --> 01:46:14,260
a little analogy.
Pretty creepy.

1920
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,680
All aboard the ride to the magic 
kingdom.

1921
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:22,540
His favorite ride.
Peter Pan.

1922
01:46:24,730 --> 01:46:25,563
Oof.

1923
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:27,300
Boys never grow up.

1924
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:30,700
Thanks.

1925
01:46:33,730 --> 01:46:34,563
You know,
this reminds me when I was a kid in my 

1926
01:46:36,461 --> 01:46:41,461
neighborhood that was like a religious 
neighbor that um,

1927
01:46:42,370 --> 01:46:46,030
I guess they had like a,
I don't know what you call it,

1928
01:46:46,031 --> 01:46:48,340
where you go to classes when they teach 
you there,

1929
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:51,150
they talk about the Torah and they teach
you.

1930
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:56,970
So like on Saturdays they would tell all
the kids in the neighborhood to come and

1931
01:46:56,971 --> 01:47:00,140
do they give a popsicles?
Sorry.

1932
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,730
I remember wanting to go and my dad was 
like,

1933
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,540
he knows something was up.
You're not going to this stuff.

1934
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:10,320
Because like now that I think about it,
it's pretty weird.

1935
01:47:10,321 --> 01:47:12,240
Why are you inviting kids and giving 
them pups?

1936
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:13,890
Cool.
Why do you want all the kids over there?

1937
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:16,560
Yeah.
With like this irresistible invitation.

1938
01:47:16,561 --> 01:47:18,510
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1939
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:24,690
It's so easy to be deviously hide behind
religion.

1940
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:26,460
That was really slick of your dad by the
way.

1941
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,353
Yeah.
I wonder if people knew or if he just 

1942
01:47:28,411 --> 01:47:30,520
had the insight or if he had.

1943
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:34,260
It's very paranoid about this stuff and 
for a good rhythm.

1944
01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:41,290
I mean it's.
It's so ironic obviously that like under

1945
01:47:41,291 --> 01:47:46,291
the guise of God and this whole 
institution of Christ is the most evil,

1946
01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:51,240
evil,
evil shit.

1947
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:52,083
We all agree and this society,
everybody agrees like child rapists are 

1948
01:47:55,721 --> 01:47:57,790
like the worst.
Right?

1949
01:47:58,050 --> 01:47:58,990
We all agree.

1950
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:01,953
Hmm.

1951
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:06,900
Somehow.
I mean at this point,

1952
01:48:06,901 --> 01:48:09,810
if you give your church,
if you give your kid over to the church,

1953
01:48:09,811 --> 01:48:12,000
I mean,
you're pretty much taking a crap shoot.

1954
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:15,083
Pretty much.
There's like a really good chance 

1955
01:48:17,521 --> 01:48:22,521
they're going to get molested.
Fuck that shit.

1956
01:48:29,921 --> 01:48:30,731
Really.
I don't know,

1957
01:48:30,731 --> 01:48:31,564
man.
It just pisses me off because there's 

1958
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,353
all of these stupid fucking conspiracies
that are ruined it with like so little 

1959
01:48:39,161 --> 01:48:39,994
evidence that it's.
There's no evidence it took a total 

1960
01:48:41,891 --> 01:48:42,724
conspiracy that are fucking with people 
that have nothing to do with this shit 

1961
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:49,533
and they're ignoring.
It's making a joke of this serious 

1962
01:48:52,990 --> 01:48:53,823
actual or they're just using it as 
political attack and it's can't be more 

1963
01:48:57,671 --> 01:48:59,950
obvious than this because they're not 
talking about the church,

1964
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:04,390
but somehow Obama's pedophile,
Hillary Clinton's a pedophile.

1965
01:49:06,110 --> 01:49:06,943
Okay.

1966
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:12,253
It's shocking,
man.

1967
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:15,380
It's so evil,
so fucking evil.

1968
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:18,950
How can you allow organization that's 
covered up that treachery,

1969
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:22,310
that evilness for so long?
It continued to exist.

1970
01:49:22,970 --> 01:49:25,130
They should be ran out.

1971
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:27,513
I really wonder,
what did the normal people think like 

1972
01:49:30,911 --> 01:49:32,360
actual religious people.

1973
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:37,670
I would like to know,
can we get calls of Catholics

1974
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:43,410
like you got to assume that you're 
oppressed is most likely

1975
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:46,570
a pedophile.
I'm really curious what people are going

1976
01:49:46,571 --> 01:49:50,680
to think mean.
Everybody's covering it up at,

1977
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:51,641
uh,
what's the,

1978
01:49:51,641 --> 01:49:52,460
what's the number?
Eight.

1979
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:53,021
Eight.
Eight.

1980
01:49:53,021 --> 01:49:53,390
Oh,
eight.

1981
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:55,780
Dan hotmail.
Eight hot meme.

1982
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:58,270
Which seems if there's any Catholics 
listening,

1983
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,670
I'm going to clear the call queue.
If you're on the.

1984
01:50:00,810 --> 01:50:02,080
If you're.
If you've been holding.

1985
01:50:02,081 --> 01:50:03,370
Sorry guys.
You're getting hung up on.

1986
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:07,600
Deal with it.
If there's a Catholic listening that has

1987
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:09,100
a strong opinion about this,
give me a call.

1988
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:11,440
I'm interested in people that disagree 
with me.

1989
01:50:11,441 --> 01:50:16,020
I want to hear how you think I'm wrong 
about the church this week.

1990
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:19,780
We with what they know.
Well,

1991
01:50:19,781 --> 01:50:23,440
I'm saying like close it down.
So is it not as bad as.

1992
01:50:23,441 --> 01:50:24,274
I mean it seems like unarguably bad,
but either way I want to know what 

1993
01:50:27,911 --> 01:50:32,530
Catholics think about this.
So meanwhile as we populate some,

1994
01:50:32,531 --> 01:50:37,531
cause we've got the casting thing that I
don't really care about honestly.

1995
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:41,770
And then we've got the this I do like 
Kevin Spacey,

1996
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:44,853
Billionaire Boys Club movie came out and
it earned $126 on opening day was a 

1997
01:50:52,811 --> 01:50:57,811
limited release who was on like 10 
theaters but still okay with $126.

1998
01:50:58,541 --> 01:51:00,820
That's like 10 people.
It's actually less probably.

1999
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:05,560
That's just friends and family.
That's not even friends and family.

2000
01:51:05,561 --> 01:51:08,230
There was like thousands of people 
involved in that movie.

2001
01:51:08,231 --> 01:51:12,430
Probably 126 bucks.
Shit,

2002
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:14,230
you could make that work in that.
Damn.

2003
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:15,963
That's fucked up.
That one person can fuck up at home 

2004
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:18,591
project,
you know,

2005
01:51:18,591 --> 01:51:19,424
for everyone involved.
Apparently it was a really awful movie 

2006
01:51:21,551 --> 01:51:22,384
though.
I saw in rotten tomatoes they had like 

2007
01:51:24,131 --> 01:51:29,131
five percent or something.
So I mean the name billionaire boys club

2008
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:35,460
get a better name.
That's got to be embarrassing though.

2009
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:40,430
You should have.
I'm not going to say it.

2010
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,470
I was going to make a joke.
It's probably inappropriate.

2011
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:48,010
As inappropriate as raping kids as a 
priest though.

2012
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:49,113
No,
I feel like I should get a little more 

2013
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:55,190
leeway on things.

2014
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:58,980
Uh,
well I am,

2015
01:51:59,130 --> 01:51:59,963
has been a longtime February of the 
podcast at the podcast of the shell of 

2016
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:04,740
HDHP productions.
We've,

2017
01:52:05,430 --> 01:52:07,830
I've enjoyed Williams antics because 
he's,

2018
01:52:08,190 --> 01:52:10,290
as far as I,
I mean he's musically talented,

2019
01:52:10,291 --> 01:52:14,350
I guess not my style,
but he's very socially challenged and,

2020
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:19,390
and he thinks he's very suave.
He wants to be Kanye.

2021
01:52:21,090 --> 01:52:22,950
He thinks he's Kanye.
I think you're right.

2022
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:26,700
He is Kanye.
But I am afraid he might be Kanye,

2023
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:28,733
but without the Yay.
He's more of like straight up con now 

2024
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:35,820
that I dunno,
I dunno,

2025
01:52:35,850 --> 01:52:37,020
I'm not gonna.
Call him a calm,

2026
01:52:37,021 --> 01:52:39,150
but he's definitely a goofball.
Just kidding.

2027
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:42,810
So by my to the joy of this rabbit hole,
we're going to go down right now.

2028
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:44,123
Is that I this video?
And then I found out that there's 

2029
01:52:47,841 --> 01:52:52,400
actually a subreddit dedicated called 
cringe.

2030
01:52:52,401 --> 01:52:53,960
I am.
I was like,

2031
01:52:53,961 --> 01:52:54,794
wow,
this guy's prolific cringe or if he's 

2032
01:52:56,001 --> 01:52:59,360
got his own subreddit shit.
Well let's start with this video.

2033
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:01,710
You'll tell me if you think this is 
interesting.

2034
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:03,670
No,
I know.

2035
01:53:03,670 --> 01:53:04,630
I know.
I know.

2036
01:53:14,110 --> 01:53:16,620
Just can't decide.

2037
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:20,293
Does not mean the folks that go home,
we don't figure out how we work 

2038
01:53:24,191 --> 01:53:25,810
together.
Um,

2039
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:31,020
so this is for the show and what I think
will be great for the finals has nothing

2040
01:53:32,831 --> 01:53:36,580
to do with how I feel about you being an
artist moving forward.

2041
01:53:37,090 --> 01:53:39,240
So that name is that name.

2042
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:42,350
They're running at a time.
Really running out of time.

2043
01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:45,163
Hold on.
Wait,

2044
01:53:45,330 --> 01:53:46,220
I'm gonna let Jennifer.

2045
01:53:55,390 --> 01:53:59,900
I know it's tough.
Well,

2046
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:03,510
let's have a name.
Well,

2047
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:08,640
that's really enough.
It's going to be going to be

2048
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:16,810
okay.
Got It.

2049
01:54:16,810 --> 01:54:18,110
This is the hardest thing.

2050
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:24,860
Get on with it much to this show.
And then when he says it,

2051
01:54:28,691 --> 01:54:29,524
nobody cares.

2052
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:33,560
I just want them to stop the music.

2053
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:36,513
Tanya,

2054
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:43,443
kind of a goofy and not that bad,
but like it really more about the fact 

2055
01:54:47,811 --> 01:54:52,811
that there's a cringe I am subreddit.
And so then I hopped on over there and I

2056
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:54,560
was like,
wow,

2057
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:55,783
there is some good stuff here.
So kind of want to go down the list of 

2058
01:55:00,591 --> 01:55:04,040
cringe.
I am top of all time and now this one is

2059
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:04,874
really pointed.
I would say it's very educational and 

2060
01:55:07,450 --> 01:55:07,790
maintenance.

2061
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:10,910
Were you a little bit as well?
Startup of the year guide,

2062
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:14,570
tip of the week.
What makes a great logo?

2063
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:19,850
First off your logo has to be just as 
impactful in black and white.

2064
01:55:19,970 --> 01:55:22,480
Kind of reminds me of that kid is like,
you will.

2065
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:25,390
You were,
you got you got my dream is do you

2066
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:33,160
sure if your logo is not?
I mean then there's a problem.

2067
01:55:34,490 --> 01:55:38,480
He has like his.
I know very,

2068
01:55:38,490 --> 01:55:39,323
very slick.
His eyes or he can't make eye contact 

2069
01:55:41,211 --> 01:55:44,190
and he started on drugs or something 
collapses.

2070
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:46,050
When you blow it up really,
really big,

2071
01:55:46,410 --> 01:55:47,243
then there's a problem.
If your logo can't transform itself to 

2072
01:55:52,381 --> 01:55:55,680
other things and you still know what 
that logo is and there's a problem,

2073
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:58,880
so you should be able to have all those 
things.

2074
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:03,210
What are they doing in the there two 
cameras and have a camera there and he's

2075
01:56:03,211 --> 01:56:07,530
looking through that camera.
They're not using the character but he's

2076
01:56:07,531 --> 01:56:08,364
not supposed to.
I don't think it's supposed to switch 

2077
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:12,780
companies is not supposed to dark 
between the cameras.

2078
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:13,633
Now they show it when it's not like no,
but you're not supposed to dark between 

2079
01:56:16,141 --> 01:56:16,974
the cameras.
They just wanted like a nice profile 

2080
01:56:18,481 --> 01:56:19,560
shot and he's doing this.

2081
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:21,813
He's doing like this,
but I put that he's supposed to do with 

2082
01:56:23,381 --> 01:56:24,214
that.
He's looking kind of in between them 

2083
01:56:26,591 --> 01:56:27,140
though.

2084
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:31,490
The company's objective on a symbolic 
level.

2085
01:56:32,770 --> 01:56:33,603
Right?
Because you have to think of what India 

2086
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:39,010
is going to do to the world.
Right?

2087
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:41,970
We know it's silicone valley did to the 
world with him.

2088
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:42,843
We know China does for the world,
but what India is going to do for the 

2089
01:56:45,501 --> 01:56:46,334
world is they're going to create this 
symbolic language because India is 

2090
01:56:50,301 --> 01:56:51,950
unique because they speak English.

2091
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,820
He's talking about about logo.
Yeah,

2092
01:56:53,821 --> 01:56:56,350
he's talking about the logo,
different alphabet.

2093
01:56:57,250 --> 01:56:58,460
Damn,
he's on.

2094
01:56:58,700 --> 01:56:59,990
He's on.
He's on to something.

2095
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:02,083
I wonder what.
I wonder how he wipes easier read 

2096
01:57:03,891 --> 01:57:08,690
jamming or what was the green?
Jasmine Green.

2097
01:57:08,691 --> 01:57:09,940
A Green Gentlemen.

2098
01:57:10,150 --> 01:57:10,983
So I don't want to pick up a red jacket.
Going to add a whole new type of visual 

2099
01:57:14,950 --> 01:57:15,783
connecting language to the planning and 
symbology and logos are going to play a 

2100
01:57:21,521 --> 01:57:22,354
big role on that.
Understanding something just by looking 

2101
01:57:25,961 --> 01:57:30,640
at a logo or different symbols,
a new language,

2102
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,060
a new type of font.

2103
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,980
I can talk and talk about it.

2104
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:39,480
It doesn't say anything.
Well,

2105
01:57:39,481 --> 01:57:40,590
it's.
It's really that,

2106
01:57:40,650 --> 01:57:41,483
that ultimate saying all you need in 
life to be successful is confidence and 

2107
01:57:47,171 --> 01:57:48,004
ignorance.
It's like if you have that unshakeable 

2108
01:57:50,831 --> 01:57:51,664
confidence,
if you don't even think about anything 

2109
01:57:54,281 --> 01:57:56,860
you're saying you never consider what 
you're saying.

2110
01:57:56,861 --> 01:57:58,780
You're going to sound to some people.
Smart.

2111
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,610
Anyway.
Do we have any callers?

2112
01:58:05,670 --> 01:58:09,330
Let's see.
Looks like we got one.

2113
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:12,360
What's his name and what do you think?
Is this a call?

2114
01:58:13,530 --> 01:58:17,220
You're saying he's got one on deck that 
he thinks will be better,

2115
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:22,340
so maybe hold off for a second.
Okay guys.

2116
01:58:24,770 --> 01:58:27,180
Well we've pretty much reached the end,
but I want to take this call.

2117
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:33,700
I'm canceling cable.
I'm so sick of fucking cable.

2118
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:38,710
Me and Isla were let you know what?
Let's get cable.

2119
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:39,573
We got it for the first time ever,
like a few months ago and it's so 

2120
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:46,120
stupid.
Well we said,

2121
01:58:46,121 --> 01:58:47,980
you know what?
People like cable,

2122
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:52,560
let's try it out.
It was almost nostalgic for me because I

2123
01:58:52,561 --> 01:58:54,420
used.
I remember like my parents are there.

2124
01:58:54,430 --> 01:58:57,010
Could you just turn on the TV and 
something that will play.

2125
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:59,200
Like you don't have to choose all the 
time.

2126
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:00,143
Right.
What to watch with Netflix and those 

2127
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:05,170
kind of services,
but oh my God,

2128
01:59:05,350 --> 01:59:06,183
it's just commercial.
Well first of all it costs like $120 a 

2129
01:59:10,271 --> 01:59:11,660
month.
Okay.

2130
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:13,773
Which is more than double.
Pretty much what it would cost that 

2131
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:19,750
every streaming app,
including like Hbo and Showtime

2132
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:21,603
[inaudible].

2133
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:22,723
So then there are so many commercials,
like the other day I sit down for 

2134
01:59:27,801 --> 01:59:32,801
breakfast and it's at the tail end of 
the show and I'm sitting,

2135
01:59:33,141 --> 01:59:33,974
I'm eating and I'm just watching 
commercials and it's like five minutes 

2136
01:59:38,811 --> 01:59:40,670
long by the time I'm done with my 
breakfast,

2137
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:41,833
the shows back on.
And then let's say you don't like the 

2138
01:59:44,241 --> 01:59:46,640
show.
You waited five minutes to see what it's

2139
01:59:46,641 --> 01:59:47,474
about.
Then you're wanting to switch the 

2140
01:59:48,501 --> 01:59:49,334
channel.
Yeah,

2141
01:59:49,490 --> 01:59:53,120
always it turns on on commercials and 
then it's like a knight of fire.

2142
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:57,050
If you just go channel up through all 
the main channels,

2143
01:59:57,140 --> 01:59:59,810
you're gonna hit commercials about 50 
percent of the time.

2144
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:02,870
The other 50 percent of the time you 
were about to go onto a commercial?

2145
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:03,863
Yeah.
Like I can watch the same shows on Hulu 

2146
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:11,660
without commercials.
Why am I on cable?

2147
02:00:11,690 --> 02:00:13,310
Why do I have cable?
I don't get it.

2148
02:00:14,150 --> 02:00:16,280
The only thing is that you can record 
shows,

2149
02:00:16,281 --> 02:00:19,400
but I mean they never invented that 
dude.

2150
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:21,183
But like,
and then the other day our recording 

2151
02:00:23,691 --> 02:00:26,930
thing wasn't working and it's not 
recording the shows we want.

2152
02:00:26,931 --> 02:00:27,560
And I'm like,
okay,

2153
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:29,570
so there really is no reason to have 
this.

2154
02:00:30,770 --> 02:00:33,770
Then the shit that's on their flip flop 
flip and flop.

2155
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:35,773
Pawn stars flip or flop.
It's like the dumbest shit that you 

2156
02:00:39,261 --> 02:00:40,730
didn't even know existed.

2157
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:46,370
Like I'm happier knowing that these 
shows don't exist.

2158
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:53,750
There's so many house flipping shows.
Do we need more house flipping shows?

2159
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:56,333
You've got a gay couple.
You got a black couple that a white 

2160
02:00:58,321 --> 02:00:59,700
couple.
You've got one Asian,

2161
02:00:59,701 --> 02:01:02,880
one red had a couple.
You've got a couple of that's divorced.

2162
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:06,270
They're in Las Vegas.
They're in California.

2163
02:01:06,271 --> 02:01:11,271
They're in Houston or in Florida or the 
lottery.

2164
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:12,273
The lottery.
That was one of definitely talked about 

2165
02:01:13,541 --> 02:01:15,980
this before we talked about it.
I don't.

2166
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,300
I believe these shows that exist.
There's a show on home on this.

2167
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:20,680
Oh,
you must've talked about it.

2168
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:25,890
There's one called my lottery dream 
house where they get lottery winners and

2169
02:01:26,081 --> 02:01:29,020
follow them to build their dream house 
with the lottery winnings.

2170
02:01:29,021 --> 02:01:30,430
I'm like,
how niche do you get?

2171
02:01:33,830 --> 02:01:38,680
There's so many news.
Twenty four hour news all day every day.

2172
02:01:38,681 --> 02:01:40,700
So News.
So many people with opinions.

2173
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:45,890
So many commercials.
So many commercials.

2174
02:01:45,891 --> 02:01:48,730
What am I missing?
Hmm,

2175
02:01:48,870 --> 02:01:50,670
what am I missing?
Why do people like cable?

2176
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:52,333
Do we have a call yet?
I'm just dragging on trying to waste 

2177
02:01:54,181 --> 02:01:56,430
time.
We're good on that.

2178
02:01:56,431 --> 02:01:57,720
It's been two hours.
Okay.

2179
02:01:57,721 --> 02:01:58,710
Gabrielle here.
Hero.

2180
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,060
Is this a go and right?
Gabriela?

2181
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:01,710
That's the one.
All right,

2182
02:02:01,711 --> 02:02:02,544
let's bring her in.

2183
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:06,450
Gabriela.
Thanks for giving us a ring.

2184
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:09,193
No problem.

2185
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,220
So tell me about.
So okay.

2186
02:02:11,221 --> 02:02:12,054
You,
you've been listening to our 

2187
02:02:12,431 --> 02:02:16,060
conversation about the Catholic church.
I have.

2188
02:02:16,061 --> 02:02:16,894
Yeah.
So what's your reaction to what I've 

2189
02:02:19,181 --> 02:02:20,014
been saying?

2190
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:25,150
Um,
a lot of reactions.

2191
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:26,013
So it's very interesting.
I went to 12 years of Catholic school 

2192
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:32,370
and I'm still a practicing Catholic.
Um,

2193
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:38,520
my personal reaction is usually to just 
disconnect myself a little bit from kind

2194
02:02:40,831 --> 02:02:43,630
of what's going on in the Catholic 
Church and just,

2195
02:02:44,590 --> 02:02:47,230
I still go to mass.
So it kind of worked a disconnect.

2196
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:51,100
That piece of it just to the priests,
the people,

2197
02:02:51,190 --> 02:02:53,480
the institution itself.
Um,

2198
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:57,760
because then it kinda gets a little bit 
culty and weird.

2199
02:02:58,490 --> 02:02:59,950
Um,
but for me,

2200
02:03:00,370 --> 02:03:03,310
since I grew up going to church,
there's something calming about it.

2201
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:09,000
But you really have to work to remove 
yourself from what's going on because it

2202
02:03:10,121 --> 02:03:10,954
gets down to like telling the priest 
will tell you how to vote and what you 

2203
02:03:14,381 --> 02:03:16,930
should believe,
what stickley and you know,

2204
02:03:16,931 --> 02:03:19,900
there's a lot of things that I don't 
agree with with the Catholic church,

2205
02:03:20,410 --> 02:03:23,680
but I still practice and I still believe
in the fundamentals of it.

2206
02:03:23,681 --> 02:03:25,470
So as far as all the best.

2207
02:03:25,870 --> 02:03:26,500
Yeah.
Good.

2208
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:27,333
I was just gonna say it.
Was there anything that I said that 

2209
02:03:28,391 --> 02:03:29,224
upset you?

2210
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:31,723
No,
I think that I think that the sex 

2211
02:03:35,571 --> 02:03:38,810
scandals have been going on since I been
very young.

2212
02:03:39,450 --> 02:03:40,283
Um,
and part of the way that the Catholic 

2213
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:43,363
Church works is that there the priests 
move around from congregation to 

2214
02:03:46,911 --> 02:03:51,911
congregation before the sex scandal 
started or maybe because they started,

2215
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:53,253
um,
but they move around from congregation 

2216
02:03:55,161 --> 02:03:58,880
to congregation to kind of mirror how 
the apostles moved around in preached.

2217
02:03:59,570 --> 02:04:03,800
So it's a way of covering it up was,
oh,

2218
02:04:03,801 --> 02:04:04,634
this is moving to a different 
congregation when in reality I'm 

2219
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:10,100
originally from Long Island,
New York,

2220
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:12,470
or they would move them to upstate New 
York.

2221
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:13,393
So they would all be in one facility and
then that's when the coverup would 

2222
02:04:16,551 --> 02:04:17,930
happen.
Um,

2223
02:04:17,990 --> 02:04:21,740
so my high school was actually,
they just closed it down,

2224
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:22,693
um,
and one of the bishops from that whole 

2225
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:28,190
Pennsylvania scandal is actually coming 
to long island now.

2226
02:04:28,191 --> 02:04:29,990
So it's been in the news quite a bit for
us.

2227
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:32,860
Um,
so it's just,

2228
02:04:34,170 --> 02:04:37,070
I don't even the cover up on some of 
this stuff.

2229
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:38,920
I don't know if you folks are into,
um,

2230
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:43,010
some of those netflix series that go 
into some of the crimes,

2231
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:43,853
but there's one called the book about a 
cover up of a non in Baltimore where 

2232
02:04:50,761 --> 02:04:53,790
people were killed and shit.
Yep.

2233
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,233
And I have friends that went to that 
church and knew that priests and their 

2234
02:04:59,101 --> 02:05:03,160
reaction to kind of the whole thing.
It's just because the whole,

2235
02:05:03,270 --> 02:05:07,230
the whole cover up when he was beyond 
the Catholic Church and into,

2236
02:05:07,710 --> 02:05:10,830
if you have Catholics in the police 
force that it,

2237
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:11,723
you know,

2238
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:14,553
just

2239
02:05:14,730 --> 02:05:16,200
gotten so out of control.

2240
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:16,930
So.
And,

2241
02:05:16,930 --> 02:05:17,763
but you,
you sound sympathetic to what I'm 

2242
02:05:19,051 --> 02:05:19,884
saying.
You don't seem to have much conflict 

2243
02:05:21,601 --> 02:05:25,150
with my claims.
No.

2244
02:05:25,151 --> 02:05:27,820
So it's a,
it sounds very cool to you though,

2245
02:05:27,821 --> 02:05:30,970
the way you're describing it is like 
we've got Catholics in the police force,

2246
02:05:30,971 --> 02:05:33,430
you've got them all over the place.
They're all covering up.

2247
02:05:33,431 --> 02:05:34,730
I mean it sounds very cold,
like.

2248
02:05:34,850 --> 02:05:35,683
Yeah,

2249
02:05:36,410 --> 02:05:37,243
it is.
I mean if you talked to like some of my 

2250
02:05:38,991 --> 02:05:41,550
family that's very catholic very badly.

2251
02:05:41,570 --> 02:05:43,130
Well,
what do your parents think about it?

2252
02:05:43,131 --> 02:05:44,720
Because they're probably more old 
school.

2253
02:05:44,721 --> 02:05:45,554
Like I want to know what's the 
dissenting opinion because I'm sitting 

2254
02:05:49,281 --> 02:05:51,560
here saying,
shut down the Catholic church.

2255
02:05:51,740 --> 02:05:52,573
I want to hear someone be like,
I want to hear somebody say that's 

2256
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:57,440
you're fucked.
That's fucked up for saying that.

2257
02:05:58,630 --> 02:06:00,160
Yeah.
I mean I would disagree with that,

2258
02:06:00,190 --> 02:06:03,160
right?
Like I wouldn't want the Catholic Church

2259
02:06:03,161 --> 02:06:03,994
shut down.
I would want to see some of the priests 

2260
02:06:06,131 --> 02:06:09,130
that were molesting children go to jail.
I think that it's,

2261
02:06:09,990 --> 02:06:12,730
you're not above the law,
you know what I mean?

2262
02:06:12,940 --> 02:06:15,820
But don't.
But if you talked to what I'm sorry.

2263
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:18,060
I mean,

2264
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:18,910
um,
if you talk to.

2265
02:06:18,911 --> 02:06:23,070
Let's go ahead.
I got my,

2266
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:26,310
I don't know.
So you talked to like my Stepdad,

2267
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:31,340
he's very conservative.
It's kind of like it's all over now.

2268
02:06:32,610 --> 02:06:33,990
It's all over,
isn't happening anymore.

2269
02:06:33,991 --> 02:06:34,820
It's all over now.

2270
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:35,653
Kinda in denial about it.
They think it was a past problem that 

2271
02:06:38,561 --> 02:06:41,740
people are still digging up dirt.
Yup.

2272
02:06:41,890 --> 02:06:45,250
Yup.
It's like if you're.

2273
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:47,680
I'm assuming you don't have kids right 
now,

2274
02:06:47,681 --> 02:06:48,514
right?

2275
02:06:50,030 --> 02:06:50,863
I don't,
but I have a nephew that was just 

2276
02:06:53,511 --> 02:06:54,344
baptized.

2277
02:06:55,180 --> 02:06:57,880
Are you worried about your nephew being 
around priest?

2278
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:05,130
I mean I feel like you have to be 
careful with it,

2279
02:07:05,131 --> 02:07:05,964
right?
Like the Catholic schooling is a lot 

2280
02:07:09,241 --> 02:07:14,241
different now because there are a lot 
less nuns and priests period,

2281
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:19,830
which means that there's a lot of lay 
people that are teaching those classes.

2282
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:23,210
There's not really a heavy presence of 
priests.

2283
02:07:23,230 --> 02:07:24,063
Like yes you go to school it on when 
you're in the service of like doing the 

2284
02:07:27,031 --> 02:07:31,380
office serving and the things like that 
that it seems a little bit more intense.

2285
02:07:31,450 --> 02:07:33,210
Sketchy.
But I did.

2286
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:34,163
I did date one person that anytime it 
was brought up but like fly off the 

2287
02:07:38,471 --> 02:07:39,304
handle.
So you know that something happened and 

2288
02:07:40,791 --> 02:07:45,040
something like not great.
So what were the results like?

2289
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:47,020
The longterm was also that,
you know,

2290
02:07:47,021 --> 02:07:48,640
even if you go to therapy to deal with 
it,

2291
02:07:48,641 --> 02:07:50,770
I was still there.
It's like any sort of abuse,

2292
02:07:51,540 --> 02:07:52,900
abuse as abuse,
it doesn't matter.

2293
02:07:53,390 --> 02:07:56,670
You sound,
sound sympathetic and um,

2294
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:58,220
yeah.
So,

2295
02:07:58,760 --> 02:08:00,890
well thanks for sharing your story with 
us.

2296
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:02,690
Well,
frankly,

2297
02:08:02,690 --> 02:08:03,523
I,
I mean the truth is if you have an 

2298
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:08,260
instant,
I,

2299
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:09,093
I'm,
I don't want to get in an argument with 

2300
02:08:09,711 --> 02:08:12,680
you specifically because you didn't call
to argue with me,

2301
02:08:12,681 --> 02:08:15,560
so that's fine.
But like if you have an instance,

2302
02:08:15,590 --> 02:08:18,020
you say you don't shut down the church.
Well first of all,

2303
02:08:18,021 --> 02:08:20,270
constitutionally you can't shut down to 
church anyway.

2304
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:25,130
But it's like if you have systematic 
cover up,

2305
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:31,750
I feel like the institution has proven 
that it can be.

2306
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:35,820
Why does it exist?
Why does it exist at all anyway?

2307
02:08:35,821 --> 02:08:37,470
We don't have to.
I'm not trying to argue with you,

2308
02:08:37,471 --> 02:08:41,760
but thank you for calling God bless you.
Appreciate Jugs and uh,

2309
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:42,653
wish you all the best I got.
I'm not looking for people that agree 

2310
02:08:49,831 --> 02:08:50,850
with me for Christ's sake.

2311
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:53,820
Okay.
Well,

2312
02:08:53,820 --> 02:08:55,730
I think,
you know,

2313
02:08:55,790 --> 02:08:56,800
most rational people would

2314
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:57,910
have a hard time district.
Well,

2315
02:08:57,911 --> 02:08:58,744
I feel like what I'm saying is fucked up
in a way because everybody outside all 

2316
02:09:03,141 --> 02:09:05,210
over the world and being like,
shut down the Catholic church.

2317
02:09:05,211 --> 02:09:07,610
So I'm trying to understand why what I'm
saying is fucked up.

2318
02:09:09,210 --> 02:09:09,690
Well,
I think the,

2319
02:09:09,690 --> 02:09:10,523
the one point she made that was 
interesting and it's probably true for 

2320
02:09:12,421 --> 02:09:13,254
most is that because you know,
that this particular story is about 

2321
02:09:17,310 --> 02:09:18,143
instances that happened in the past.
I think a lot of people would probably 

2322
02:09:21,601 --> 02:09:21,901
think,
oh,

2323
02:09:21,901 --> 02:09:22,920
we,
we clean this up.

2324
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:24,870
It's not like this anymore.
You know what I mean?

2325
02:09:25,530 --> 02:09:27,030
Um,
which may or may not be true.

2326
02:09:27,031 --> 02:09:29,520
I don't know.
But that's probably how they rationalize

2327
02:09:29,521 --> 02:09:29,800
it.

2328
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,940
Hmm.
It's hard to know.

2329
02:09:31,941 --> 02:09:35,230
It's tricky.
It's really tricky.

2330
02:09:36,150 --> 02:09:38,720
Got To be careful on there when do your 
kids.

2331
02:09:38,721 --> 02:09:39,554
But isn't that fucked up the first 
someone who's an active member of the 

2332
02:09:41,121 --> 02:09:42,770
church to be like,
you gotta be careful.

2333
02:09:45,430 --> 02:09:46,770
Whatever.
Alright.

2334
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:51,840
I've said my piece about it.
So disturbing story,

2335
02:09:55,060 --> 02:09:58,090
shreddies gone nuts.
Starting to shred cables here.

2336
02:09:58,810 --> 02:10:01,390
So guys,
thanks for listening.

2337
02:10:02,260 --> 02:10:05,200
Hope you enjoyed this Tuesday episode.
This is the.

2338
02:10:05,201 --> 02:10:08,300
Let me tell you what to think and feel 
episode.

2339
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:13,420
Those are the Tuesday episodes,
the right opinion episodes.

2340
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:15,693
Remember guys,
there's not much time left on these 

2341
02:10:16,991 --> 02:10:19,930
represent shirts.
You got an in black,

2342
02:10:20,210 --> 02:10:22,780
you got an entire night,
you got a Hoodie,

2343
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:27,840
you got the extra thick hat on like four
days left or not even less,

2344
02:10:28,001 --> 02:10:28,550
right Dan?

2345
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:31,160
Yeah,
I think it ends Friday at noon.

2346
02:10:31,161 --> 02:10:32,060
So yeah,
about three days.

2347
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:39,310
And make sure to gut it.
Teddy fresh.com/collection/sale.

2348
02:10:39,321 --> 02:10:40,240
That's happened.
Mouthful.

2349
02:10:41,390 --> 02:10:44,300
You'll figure it out.
Having a 50 percent off sale.

2350
02:10:44,301 --> 02:10:45,134
That's insane.
And how do we do to release some new 

2351
02:10:50,091 --> 02:10:51,890
items finally?
Pretty soon.

2352
02:10:51,891 --> 02:10:53,510
In about two weeks.
Oh yeah.

2353
02:10:53,810 --> 02:10:54,643
We're going to make a video.
Kind of a preview for Ethan and yella 

2354
02:10:56,601 --> 02:10:58,070
before.
Maybe not.

2355
02:10:58,071 --> 02:10:58,940
Maybe.
Definitely.

2356
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:01,040
I'm excited.
You don't want to.

2357
02:11:02,210 --> 02:11:04,670
I just say maybe because we haven't 
posted in so long.

2358
02:11:04,671 --> 02:11:06,740
I don't even.
It's like a blog that would just be like

2359
02:11:06,741 --> 02:11:07,760
a Bot.
How do we do?

2360
02:11:07,761 --> 02:11:12,761
How is this episode was good?
Emotional rollercoaster,

2361
02:11:13,370 --> 02:11:15,410
like you said,
I always feel like an asshole,

2362
02:11:15,411 --> 02:11:20,411
like expressing strong opinions.
What is the.

2363
02:11:20,550 --> 02:11:21,383
This is the.
This is the strong offended therapist 

2364
02:11:23,351 --> 02:11:27,910
while you watch the show and I will be 
spending a lot of time on.

2365
02:11:27,911 --> 02:11:32,911
I'm better help.
I need so much time on better home.

2366
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:38,220
It was fine.
It was good.

2367
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:42,690
You see how fucked up I am you guys.
I'm having a dialogue on.

2368
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:45,960
On camera.
Will you just do this off camera?

2369
02:11:45,961 --> 02:11:47,040
I usually shop for Cameron.
Be like.

2370
02:11:47,041 --> 02:11:47,970
Was that okay?
You guys.

2371
02:11:47,971 --> 02:11:48,900
Was that show?
Okay.

2372
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:52,470
Roll up and go.
I want you guys to see just how insecure

2373
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:56,700
and how neurotic and anxious who a 
person I am on camera,

2374
02:11:56,701 --> 02:11:59,070
because that's what this podcast is 
about.

2375
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:00,983
People say,

2376
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:02,683
you know,

2377
02:12:06,490 --> 02:12:08,180
look,
now he's chewing on.

2378
02:12:08,860 --> 02:12:12,680
That is so cute.
You're so fucking cute luck.

2379
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:16,850
You can say I'm an asshole.
You can say I'm a Jew.

2380
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:20,090
When you says an insult,
that's not okay.

2381
02:12:20,530 --> 02:12:22,880
That's true.
You can say whatever you want about me,

2382
02:12:23,690 --> 02:12:25,760
but I feel like

2383
02:12:27,330 --> 02:12:31,050
this is as real as it gets.
This is live,

2384
02:12:31,051 --> 02:12:32,490
baby.
There's no take backs.

2385
02:12:33,030 --> 02:12:35,220
I might sound like an asshole.
I might sound like an idiot.

2386
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:37,560
I might sound uneducated,
might sound racist,

2387
02:12:37,770 --> 02:12:40,500
but this is as real as it gets.
There's no take backs.

2388
02:12:40,501 --> 02:12:42,150
This is live.
Okay,

2389
02:12:42,151 --> 02:12:46,680
so forgive me if sometimes I sound 
stupid or offensive or you think.

2390
02:12:46,681 --> 02:12:48,420
I mean,
there's no editing it out.

2391
02:12:49,530 --> 02:12:51,300
It's all off the cuff.
This is live.

2392
02:12:51,950 --> 02:12:55,320
This is who I am,
just like garth brooks said,

2393
02:12:55,830 --> 02:13:00,830
and that's just who I am.
There's no hiding from me when it's live

2394
02:13:03,570 --> 02:13:08,570
me for myself,
when there's no hiding from it,

2395
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:11,250
there's no hiding from myself when it's 
live.

2396
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:13,623
And so I want you guys to see how 
neurotic and insecure and anxious I am 

2397
02:13:17,370 --> 02:13:18,203
because the truth is,
you guys probably think I'm a perfect 

2398
02:13:20,191 --> 02:13:23,240
cool ass dude.
They just confident always.

2399
02:13:23,250 --> 02:13:24,750
All right,
just fucking good.

2400
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:29,200
Cheering on your shoe.
Now what is a trump?

2401
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:30,930
But the truth is,

2402
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,993
boy,
don't feel like that guy ever and think 

2403
02:13:36,751 --> 02:13:39,270
is important for you to know that.
Right?

2404
02:13:39,470 --> 02:13:40,303
Yeah.

2405
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:46,900
Alright.
Alright.

2406
02:13:50,060 --> 02:13:55,060
Only soundboard I need is to get on my.
Shut my ass down.

2407
02:14:00,310 --> 02:14:01,750
Alright.
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

2408
02:14:02,140 --> 02:14:07,140
Please let us know if you did or didn't 
really want to know if they didn't.

2409
02:14:09,010 --> 02:14:11,780
I mean if everyone's like,
I didn't enjoy that,

2410
02:14:11,980 --> 02:14:13,000
that I should probably.
Listen.

2411
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:17,620
Dan will filter comments to me.
That's how insecure and fragile I am.

2412
02:14:17,621 --> 02:14:18,454
I don't,
I can't.

2413
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:24,100
I literally can't even see it.
That's how fragile I am.

2414
02:14:24,101 --> 02:14:26,980
You Bet.
I want you to know I am a fragile.

2415
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:32,140
I am petty.
I'm insecure and I'm deeply unhappy.

2416
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:37,300
What you do.
I brought in the,

2417
02:14:37,301 --> 02:14:39,490
uh,
the podcast theme song,

2418
02:14:39,491 --> 02:14:41,820
which is very upbeat as you're playing 
right now.

2419
02:14:42,970 --> 02:14:45,510
So I'm just gonna remember that guys.
I'm not A.

2420
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:46,553
I'm fucked.
Probably more than you are not a Dick 

2421
02:14:50,950 --> 02:14:51,783
measuring contest.
I wasn't going to say have a nice 

2422
02:14:54,701 --> 02:14:57,110
weekend.
Not a weekend and weekend.

2423
02:14:57,250 --> 02:14:58,083
That's what I'm saying.
But this Friday we've gotten Bert 

2424
02:15:00,490 --> 02:15:01,600
Kreischer,
which I'm excited about.

2425
02:15:01,690 --> 02:15:03,940
Super Funny.
He's super great guy.

2426
02:15:04,490 --> 02:15:05,323
We finally get them in the podcast.
He's one of my favorite comedians and 

2427
02:15:07,420 --> 02:15:11,110
hilarious and shirtless.
I wonder if he's going to wear a shirt.

2428
02:15:11,730 --> 02:15:12,790
That's a good question.
Actually.

2429
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:16,930
I prefer shirt speaking frankly,
but I leave the choice to end.

2430
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:21,010
I think he wears a chef probably eight a
day.

2431
02:15:21,011 --> 02:15:24,670
He shared it,
so tune in on Friday at our usual time.

2432
02:15:24,671 --> 02:15:29,671
I hope you guys enjoyed this and you've 
been filled in with the right up in.

2433
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:32,373
Thanks for watching.
