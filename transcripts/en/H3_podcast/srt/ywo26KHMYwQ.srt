Sean McLaughlin,

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,360
more popularly known as Jack Septic eye.
20 million subscribers.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,853
10

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,760
Yep.
Then billing yet not so close though,

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,960
right?
It's like 9.9

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,610
I mean,
you just hit 20 million,

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,650
right?
Yeah,

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,180
like four days ago.
That's pretty insane.

13
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:40,610
Like 20 that's so fun.
I know.

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,533
And every time it's like you,
you hear the numbers go up and up and 

15
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:44,570
up.
And then it was like,

16
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:48,830
I wrote it out to somebody in like 20 
minutes as a lot of zero fucking weird.

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,050
I Dunno.
Why?

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,470
How does it mean?
Do you ever expect like,

19
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,910
okay,
it's going to slow down now?

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,490
Yeah.
I think everyone kind of expected.

21
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:58,970
Yeah.
They're like,

22
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,150
all right,
it's going to slow down.

23
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,123
Yeah.
Yeah,

24
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,170
yeah.
I would think.

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,260
Okay.
That's probably,

26
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,870
it never stopped.
Let's go on up there.

27
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,123
I don't know.
I don't want to have a wire tap it in 

28
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:08,994
somewhere.
I have a secret upload button that gets 

29
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,410
more subscribers or something.

30
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,500
I Dunno.
Damn.

31
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,550
That's crazy.
Um,

32
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,970
well,
anyway,

33
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,310
welcome to Los Angeles.
Thank you.

34
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,890
A good Irish boy.
Yeah.

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,570
I haven't burst into flames yet.
It's not yet.

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,510
It'll happen.
I mean,

37
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:27,344
you're,
I guess that's a joke about you being 

38
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,240
pale I soon,
yes.

39
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:30,620
They're not that pill.
No,

40
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,110
it's not.
That bad situation is not that bad.

41
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:34,330
It's pretty fucking bad.
I mean,

42
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:35,480
my,
well yeah,

43
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,600
it's been here a long time where you 
just fail.

44
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,670
I made,
while frank laid don't,

45
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,533
I mean,
look,

46
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,463
I don't leave the house.
You don't have to go in the sun out 

47
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:44,421
here.
That's true.

48
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:45,254
I mean,
yeah.

49
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,140
And if he doesn't penetrate my roof,
that's,

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,220
that's the problem with La.
You go outside,

51
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:52,190
you die or you get stuck in traffic.
So,

52
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,270
uh,
by the way,

53
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:55,280
do you live in Ireland or do you live in
the UK?

54
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,150
Where do you live right now?

55
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,170
I lived in Ireland until last year,
then I moved to Brighton.

56
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,270
So I've been living there for a year 
since May.

57
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,560
That's where pewter pilots,
right?

58
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,573
Yeah.
You guys,

59
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,570
you guys hang out.
You guys grab yours,

60
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,300
hang out,
make out all the time.

61
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,160
No,
it's weird cause we,

62
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,520
we live in the same town and he's like a
30 minute drive for me.

63
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,040
Oh yeah.
Almost never see each other.

64
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,870
30 minutes is like five minutes.
Best friends,

65
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,660
30 minutes and I'll talk to you.
So yeah,

66
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,350
we'll see.
She was like once a month maybe.

67
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,223
Yeah.
Although it's kind of close like 30 

68
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,710
minutes.
That's pretty close.

69
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,023
Same time.
It's also like I'll see you next year 

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,233
and then I've been doing tour stuff and 
everything and he has his own stuff 

71
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,790
that's going on so we never like find 
the right time.

72
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,240
Why'd you move to a brighton?
Um,

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,070
I mean it was kind of moves.

74
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,500
I wanted to move anyway and I thought,
well why am I going to move to la?

75
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,870
That seems a bit far.
It's just a lot going on there.

76
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:46,760
I have a lot to figure out.
And I was like,

77
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:49,460
well I could have moved to London but 
that's too hectic.

78
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,130
I don't really like London to live.
I was like,

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,993
oh Brighton.
I went to visit Felix and fell in love 

80
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,150
with it.
Seems like a nice little spot.

81
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,430
Yeah.
It's literally out on the beach.

82
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,040
Nice and cozy.
People there are nice.

83
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,903
You go to the beach?
Not really because it's not a real 

84
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:05,760
beach.
It's like a pebble goes all the time.

85
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,723
Yeah.
You never really have the weather while 

86
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:11,620
La Kinda has the same problem.
It's like come to la for the beaches but

87
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,620
never go in it because of the water is 
so cold all the time.

88
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,470
Have you been at the beach here in la?
No.

89
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,800
I pull it down off the beach.
Shit.

90
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,990
Yeah.
Don't bother about it so far away.

91
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,250
I don't want to,
don't worry about it.

92
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,830
Don't leave the house.
Don't go to the beach.

93
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,000
La is great.
Yeah,

94
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,680
it's lovely.
Make a lot of friends.

95
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,233
What brings you out to la?
Cause you came out here on an extended 

96
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,571
trip,
right?

97
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:33,220
Like you're out here for a couple 
months.

98
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,054
You kind of escaping a little bit.
Would you say getting out here and kind 

99
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:40,020
of just,
hey my life you a little way of life.

100
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,480
I wanted to become a movie actor.
Really reach Hollywood.

101
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,410
No,
I was like,

102
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:47,170
I don't know too much shit.
Yeah.

103
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,090
That's how long it takes.
Yeah.

104
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,330
Four years.
I'll see you on TV somewhere.

105
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,190
I Dunno.
I kind of,

106
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,024
I've always wanted to come for a while 
and every time I come here like we've 

107
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,630
been trying to do this for a long time.

108
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,800
I remember when you started off you're 
like,

109
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:00,820
you should do it.
Yeah.

110
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,400
That was in town for like a week and 
nothing ever lined up ever.

111
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,970
Yeah,
I'm sure.

112
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,880
Yeah.
So it was like come for a month or two.

113
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,923
I have a visa for tour anyway when the 
phone and abused that and stay here for 

114
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:13,420
a while and hang out with friends for a 
longer period of time.

115
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,853
And then it was supposed to be until 
August and then tour leaves in August 

116
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,124
and I was going to go back afterwards 
and then my visa got extended so I can 

117
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:24,430
technically stay here longer,
so nice.

118
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,170
Why not?
I don't need to be back home in Brighton

119
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:29,710
for anything anytime soon.
So just hang out here and do cool stuff.

120
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,753
But you,
I mean you've been talking a lot about 

121
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,360
being burned out and taking a break from
your panel.

122
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,170
Is that kind of is coming out to la 
almost like therapeutic kind of get away

123
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:40,750
from the life back there.
Yeah.

124
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,584
Which is weird cause I said that I 
needed a break and I was getting burned 

125
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:46,030
out and I just needed to figure out what
I wanted to do and everyone's was like,

126
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,640
La is not the place to go find yourself 
out.

127
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,210
Disagree by the way.
Really I feel like La gets a bad rep.

128
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,430
Yeah.
I love that La is,

129
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,100
this is a huge metropolis,
one of the biggest,

130
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,910
I mean per square miles,
it's enormous.

131
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,730
There's so many different communities 
and different you can be and do whatever

132
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:05,710
you want here.
I don't know why everyone has such a bad

133
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,530
perception of La la.
Yeah.

134
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:11,380
I don't know why I agree with doing well
anyway,

135
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,350
so,
but I mean you are in a sense kind of,

136
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,800
I mean you out here kind of just trying 
to figure things out or is it more just,

137
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:18,880
you know,
coincidental.

138
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,500
Yeah,
what bit of both.

139
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,070
Yeah,
I was,

140
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,903
I was just got really miserable doing 
the types of videos I was doing after 

141
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:25,714
awhile.
It was like a whole month where I was 

142
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:28,030
like,
this is crap.

143
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,670
Like I'm uploading Shit just for the 
sake of uploading.

144
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:34,350
And I was so stringent on my schedule 
and I was so proud of that schedule.

145
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:35,560
It was like,
I don't want to break that.

146
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,690
But your fans could they tell?
Yeah.

147
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,850
So that,
that was what made me do it cause they,

148
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:41,470
they started being able to see it and I 
was like,

149
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,390
well if I'm not enjoying it,
you're not enjoying it.

150
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,340
What kind of comments would they say 
where you were like,

151
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,990
oh shit.
Like maybe just like a,

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,380
I didn't seem happy.
I don't have the energy I normally had.

153
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:52,420
I looked sad,
I looked tired,

154
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,800
which I fully agreed with.

155
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,633
I was,
and then it just came to a point where 

156
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:56,261
it's like,
okay,

157
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:57,260
yeah,
I need to,

158
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,790
and I was coming here anyways,
so I was like,

159
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,530
okay,
I'll on the way to la,

160
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:01,364
I'll just take a week off.
I've never ever taken any time off of 

161
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:05,270
youtube and the five years I've been 
doing it,

162
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:05,991
so I was like,
okay,

163
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,850
full break.
No Youtube,

164
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,260
no twitter,
no tumbler,

165
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:10,520
no instagram,
no none of that.

166
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,510
And I decided would just spend a week of
my own and it was great.

167
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,260
I got here and hung out with friends.
Completely changed my mind again.

168
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,180
You feeling better?
Oh,

169
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:23,660
100% I'm completely one 80 done where I 
was.

170
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,240
You feeling like motivated to,
but are you,

171
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,070
are you afraid?
Like if you get back into it,

172
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:28,904
you almost fall back into it?
Because that was my problem was like 

173
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,380
I've been through that same exact thing.

174
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,390
I mean I don't have a crazy upload 
schedule like you were,

175
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,600
you were doing two videos the day for a 
long time.

176
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,220
Five years,
but then you went,

177
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:43,430
you started doing one a day recently or,
yeah,

178
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,110
whenever I'd have to go out and tour or 
something.

179
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,330
I kind of bump it down,
but it was still like,

180
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:48,590
can you still wore,
I'm still working.

181
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,260
I remember seeing you in New York a 
couple,

182
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,930
couple of years ago.
[inaudible] 16 yeah,

183
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,250
it was a long ass time ago.
And,

184
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,450
and you and Felix and mark were there 
and I was like,

185
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,161
you're like,
oh yeah,

186
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:05,820
we all made videos ahead of time and 
they're all scheduled the upload.

187
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,683
I was like,
what?

188
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,200
I mean that's just fuck.
That's just twisted.

189
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:16,200
Like there's something fucked up about 
this job in particular.

190
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:17,034
Yeah.
Right.

191
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,253
I mean to be fair,
my stuff is a lot easier to do than the 

192
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,440
ones you did.
Yeah.

193
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,274
But still let's,
I mean you're still making two videos a 

194
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:24,710
day.
Okay.

195
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,200
And you still under the same 
expectation,

196
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,810
your fans have expectations,
you have expectations of yourself.

197
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,750
I mean our,
our approach is different,

198
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,210
but the consumption of time and the 
expectation is the same.

199
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,640
Yeah.
I think that's fair.

200
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,050
But like this job seems particularly 
fucked up,

201
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,240
right?
Like what is it about,

202
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,550
because everyone was talking about this 
thing of like burnout,

203
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,510
right?
Youtube or burnout.

204
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,610
That's really big right now.
Everyone's so aware.

205
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,700
We haven't posted a video where we are 
in the middle of burnout.

206
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,950
I would say for all,
I'm fully burnt out.

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,790
Like there's no wax left in the camp.

208
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm new canvas.
I'm taking out a new candle.

209
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,930
I Dunno,
like handle smell like lavender jasmine.

210
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,720
No,
not those are the lavender is flowing in

211
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,040
it.
Um,

212
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,460
yeah.
I need a new essence.

213
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,780
What's going on?
Why?

214
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,590
Why is being a Youtuber so fucked up?
It's rolled psychopaths.

215
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,213
I Dunno.
I think it's because you started it 

216
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,674
cause you love it and then it becomes 
your job and then you have an audience 

217
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:30,824
and people to take care of and you want 
to do the best you can and it's just a 

218
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:34,094
platform and a job that you,
you're not really allowed take time 

219
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,910
allowed.
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

220
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,773
Right.
But it's just not in your best interest 

221
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:41,540
to do it.
And no one's,

222
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,830
you don't,
you're your own boss.

223
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:43,664
You make your own hours,
you make your own schedules and then 

224
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:47,000
it's the curse I think.
Yeah.

225
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,863
And now it's just,
youtube is just in such a weird place 

226
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:50,054
anyway with all the shit that's been 
happening over the last year or two 

227
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:56,280
years and now they're trying to 
diversify their streams and everything.

228
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:59,070
So everyone just feels like on that 
treadmill more than ever.

229
00:08:59,071 --> 00:08:59,904
I think.
Right and then it's just coming to a 

230
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:01,644
head and then one person talks about it.
It would sperms another person to talk 

231
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:06,480
about it and then 10 other people start 
talking about it on our,

232
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,670
everyone's able to talk about that.

233
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,573
I think part of the problem too,
I think everything you said is exactly 

234
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:10,974
right.
It's like when you're your own boss and 

235
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,450
when you're involved in something as,

236
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:16,890
yeah,

237
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,830
I mean I want to say toxic but that's 
not specific.

238
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,560
It's just so like you're on the 
treadmill,

239
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,394
you're on the hamster wheel and it just 
like you got to keep the machine 

240
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:26,634
rolling.

241
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,041
Yeah,
and the,

242
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,210
the mentalities on youtube have changed 
a lot over the years.

243
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:33,110
Like three years ago at the gaming scene
was all collaborative all the time.

244
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:33,944
It was in your best interest to collab 
with people in like beauty gurus and 

245
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:40,070
everybody would be doing it to now no 
one doesn't because everyone's afraid of

246
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,233
stepping on each other's toes.
Everyone wants to insulate their own 

247
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,160
brand and build it as far as they can 
and everything gets very,

248
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,840
I was self involved

249
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,923
I think I was going to say is that I 
think now it's more competitive because 

250
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,220
like,
I mean if you ask an average 10 year old

251
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,590
what their dream job is,
everyone wants to be a utuber.

252
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,170
Yeah.
And it's like so competitive and it's so

253
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,570
hard to become to,
you know,

254
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,273
earn a living on Youtube.
I'm a big youtuber that I think that's 

255
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,460
part of what's so toxic.
Yeah.

256
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,610
About what it's become.
But you're definitely right.

257
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,444
I mean it's just not,

258
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,700
and we can all see each others.
We can't see what each other makes.

259
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,040
But if you make a certain amount of view
is like somebody else,

260
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:18,874
you kind of know what everybody's 
makings or every youtuber kind of knows 

261
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,140
what if your subs,
you can see your views,

262
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:25,940
you can see your like how interested 
people that are the comments.

263
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,030
Everybody's just like,
well mine's better than yours.

264
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,160
And then if your yours isn't better than
than,

265
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,980
than you do some weird shit to try and 
get it to be better than somebody else.

266
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,750
And it's a lot of like,
it's not,

267
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,840
it's not friendly rivalry anymore.
I don't think there's,

268
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:39,100
okay.
So if somebody uploads something,

269
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:42,160
you think it's cool so you like want to 
do better.

270
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,053
Now it's a case of like I can fucking do
better than that and you try and shit 

271
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,310
all over somebody else.
That's that.

272
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,283
That's what I feel like youtube at large
is now everyone's trying to be better 

273
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:52,060
than each other in that way.

274
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,190
Okay.

275
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,160
I guess whatever came became popular,
you're like,

276
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,740
I swear I feel like I in some way has 
played a role in that.

277
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,143
I do so because like I feel like when we
first started coming up popular on 

278
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:07,294
Youtube,
it was from reaction videos and like 

279
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,770
shitting on people and just like,
I mean,

280
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,570
you know,
choose your target wisely,

281
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:15,490
but like you,
you bay,

282
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,160
I mean our early videos,
we're just really shitting on people.

283
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,120
I mean,
and I think that we did collaborate with

284
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:23,410
people to know.
I know,

285
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:24,580
but like,
um,

286
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,943
I don't,
I'm not going to say that I'm like 

287
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:31,360
wholly responsible for like this trend 
of like cometary channels,

288
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:35,530
which are basically just solely,
almost talking shit on other creators.

289
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,083
But like,
it's definitely a fad that came up 

290
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,730
around the time we started doing it.
We helped popularize it.

291
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:43,290
I can say it.

292
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,041
Well,
that's what I'm saying.

293
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,950
Like you guys started off and you,
whatever way you perceive it,

294
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:47,784
but you picked your targets property,
you pick people that you felt like were 

295
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,260
valid in criticism.
You're not shitting on someone.

296
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,480
That's just the entertainment factor of 
it.

297
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:55,840
Yeah.
It's like,

298
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,670
it's a bit more embellished than it 
would be,

299
00:11:57,671 --> 00:12:00,880
but then like I said,
somebody else sees that and they want to

300
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:01,714
do something better and they want to do 
something crazier and get more views 

301
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:04,894
than you.
So then they end up just shitting on 

302
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,700
people.
Yeah.

303
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,200
And then it becomes a thing.
It's like,

304
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,550
like,
like there's like,

305
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,033
I see this,
I see this a lot where it's just really 

306
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,040
popular content on youtube right now is 
like,

307
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,890
it's easy to shit on someone who's 
being,

308
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,480
you know,
being creative.

309
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,810
And maybe it's not your style.
Maybe it's not a video like,

310
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,063
and so it's so,
it's so easy and people do this and 

311
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,960
people love watching it being like,
this person's not funny.

312
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,070
Yeah.
And it's like,

313
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:30,904
wow,
they're making something original and 

314
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:34,180
you're just fucking shitting on them for
that.

315
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,440
Yeah.
I Dunno.

316
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,900
Maybe I'm just,
my mentality is changing,

317
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:38,734
but I see that a lot on youtube and it's
like the people who are trying to be 

318
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:43,270
creative and actually put themselves out
there,

319
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,223
it's so scary to put yourself out there 
on Youtube these days and be authentic 

320
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,830
and try to be creative and original 
because there's so many fucking,

321
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,083
there's so many people waiting to just 
eat you alive for as like you're not 

322
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,060
doing anything wrong.
You might be unfunny and my opinion,

323
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:00,490
but like what do I have to flush her 
trying,

324
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,353
yeah,
I'm going to shit on you for being an 

325
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:02,574
unfunny.
Plus the youtube audiences have just 

326
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:07,150
changed now.
It's like they all do that now.

327
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,580
Um,
it's very rare to have a community where

328
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,640
everyone is actually positive all the 
time because you're not,

329
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:13,900
you're not an up and comer anymore.

330
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,200
It's not a new job to do anymore.
You're not the underdog anymore.

331
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,093
Everyone,
there's more money involved in youtube 

332
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:22,390
now within the river husband,
and I think the audience are very keenly

333
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:23,224
aware of that and that they want to poke
at people because they feel like it's 

334
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,280
easier to do.
It's like,

335
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:28,150
well,
they have money.

336
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,710
It's just a matter of,
if I say shit to them,

337
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,401
yeah.
It's like,

338
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,234
well,
we're still people at the end of the 

339
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,590
day.
Oh,

340
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,390
I have.
I mean,

341
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,100
it's definitely a big part of it.
Anything,

342
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,983
yeah,
so it's just a whole bunch of building 

343
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,374
blocks to where it is.
That makes a difference too on the 

344
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,990
burnout because like you,
everybody,

345
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,490
even the people who talk shit on say 
like,

346
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,630
oh,
this one's not funny.

347
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,973
That's all their videos.
They're going to be more stressed out 

348
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:53,410
because they're afraid that they're 
fucking coat.

349
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,890
They're know colleagues.

350
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,723
They're going to call them out for 
fucking up and everybody's walking on 

351
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,530
eggshells because it's just like a giant
mud slinging contest these days on,

352
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,963
I mean we went through a huge 
spreadsheet of like drama and community 

353
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:07,654
and reactions and everything.
Like that circle just went around and 

354
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:11,314
around for like a whole year and then I 
think that just fundamentally changed 

355
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:15,304
everything after that Bro.
It's like communist Russia so that 

356
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,030
chopping block good and get dragged out 
in the middle of the night.

357
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,893
It's human nature.
Everyone wants to take down somebody 

358
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,260
else.
Everyone wants to find the thing.

359
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,720
It's like I'm positive and energetic all
the time,

360
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:31,480
but some people think I have like some 
weird seedy underbelly,

361
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,643
like I have like a weird peto ring or 
something that I'm keeping secret that 

362
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,450
they're like somebody waiting to find it
out.

363
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,790
Well that would explain why you're so 
energetic and happy.

364
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,850
That's why I played happy wheels all 
those years.

365
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,213
Never.
Everyone's just fucking waiting to find 

366
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:46,030
that thing about,
I mean,

367
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:47,140
you get shit on Youtube,
right?

368
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:49,330
I mean a lot.
I think people love or hate you.

369
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,530
Right?
Would you agree with that?

370
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,130
Yeah.
Why do people like,

371
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:54,410
what is it do you think that people hate
about you?

372
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,020
I don't know.
It's cause it's,

373
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,854
whenever you watch my content,
I'm obviously very boisterous and very 

374
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:00,824
loud and very energetic,
but some people either see that as 

375
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:06,200
genuine interests in energy and 
enthusiasm,

376
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,650
but to another person it's completely 
obnoxious and that's like,

377
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,960
I completely understand that there's,
if I watched it,

378
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,170
I'd probably have some sort of like 
thought process going on.

379
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,090
It is very,
yeah.

380
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,931
I mean,
I don't,

381
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:20,590
I don't hate anybody who doesn't like 
what I do.

382
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:22,460
It's fine.
Does the hate bother you?

383
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:24,890
Does it ever get too,
it used to,

384
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,030
um,
because I,

385
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,520
I'm a person who wants to like make sure
everybody's okay.

386
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,690
I,
everyone's having a good time.

387
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,500
Um,
and I just wanted everybody to like,

388
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,220
have fun.
And then when somebody doesn't have fun,

389
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:36,620
you feel like it's your responsibility 
to make them have fun button.

390
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,090
At this point I'm like,
okay,

391
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:39,490
you can't win everybody.
Yeah,

392
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,850
I'll just be happy.
I mean,

393
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:42,350
there's still 20 million people on the 
channel.

394
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:44,540
That's a fucking very,
very happy with that.

395
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,013
Yeah.
You can't really say shit at certain 

396
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:48,710
point when you have 20 million 
subscribers.

397
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,573
Yeah.
I'm not in any sort of like egotistical 

398
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:51,254
way,
but it's like clearly I've done 

399
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:55,130
something.
Well people have some an understatement.

400
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:55,851
Yeah.
So I was like,

401
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:56,391
I'll,
I'll,

402
00:15:56,391 --> 00:16:00,470
I'll feed into that positive aspect of 
the community rather than worrying about

403
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,333
what everybody else is going to say.
Do you ever feel like you don't get 

404
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:06,810
enough credit in a way,
and let me,

405
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,713
let me explain because a lot of times 
like people like you and mark computed 

406
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,430
by who play,
people always say,

407
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,920
oh you just play video games and you're 
so,

408
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,240
and you have so many,
so much,

409
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,000
you make so much money and you have so 
many people who love you and watch you.

410
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,833
All you do is play video games.
But clearly there's more going on that 

411
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,780
you feel like you don't get enough 
credit when people say that too.

412
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,240
Yeah,
I'd say so.

413
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:31,280
I'd say that's fair cause it's,
what are they missing?

414
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,183
It's,
it's the whole aspect outside of what 

415
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:35,780
you record.
Like recording it.

416
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:38,660
Game shore day after day.
That's an easy kind of thing to do.

417
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:40,760
You sit down and turn on the camera,
you record,

418
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:41,594
but you have to find the games,
you have to find stuff that people want 

419
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:44,204
to see when it's daily,
everything like fluctuates so much and 

420
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,640
you have to like be always kind of there
for your audience.

421
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,970
And I'm very heavily involved in my 
audience and interacting with them.

422
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,520
So it's like after the video goes up 
it's like,

423
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,383
well now I'm on social media and I'm 
interacting with people that I'm making 

424
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:02,090
sure everyone's okay and um,
re-blogging fine art.

425
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,220
I'm like tweeting out at people and 
everything.

426
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,054
So it's,
it's a whole lot more than just sitting 

427
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:08,990
down and recording the video and you see
a 20 minute video.

428
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,240
Like when I was recording what was the 
sub Nautica,

429
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:12,074
it was like,
like sometimes it was an hour long 

430
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:14,294
video,
but that was like a two and a half hour 

431
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:17,900
session that's chopped down and that was
going out every single day.

432
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:19,910
So I was like sure.
And it's,

433
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,580
and it's isolated bubble.
It's an easy thing to do to play a game.

434
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:23,414
And react to it.
But to do it that consistently for that 

435
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:26,810
long,
they never take a break.

436
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,600
I feel like just insane man hour.
Yeah.

437
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,820
So it's just like,
it's not hard to do.

438
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:34,190
It's hard to keep it up.
Yeah.

439
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,150
And I mean you,
you find your rhythm,

440
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,460
you get into your schedule.
I mean the thing is like,

441
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,593
yeah,
once you start seeing your channel 

442
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:46,370
growing and you start making money,
it's like really motivating.

443
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,200
But you get used to that.
Yeah.

444
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,380
And,
and then it's like it's,

445
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,450
I dunno,
it's hard.

446
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,160
It's like you lose,
it's a thing,

447
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:55,020
especially with my channel,
cause it rose so quickly,

448
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,510
obviously plateaus out.
Every channel does.

449
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,470
It's healthy.
It's fine.

450
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,343
Yeah.
But some people went their channels 

451
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:03,240
plateau with a freak out and they feel 
like they have to do something else.

452
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,700
Cause no insane growth is no growth at 
all to them.

453
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,590
Sure.
Especially when you're used to like,

454
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,270
yeah,
like this steroid injection.

455
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:12,210
So it's like you started off in,
everyone's like,

456
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,740
oh this is fun,
this is cool.

457
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,960
And then it's like,
oh well now I kind of get your gimmick.

458
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,910
I know what you are like,
what else can you do?

459
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,470
And that's the trap people can fall 
into.

460
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,304
Cause then that's how you ended up 
recording a dead body in a forest 

461
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,160
somewhere because you feel like you have
to keep pushing this thing.

462
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,993
So you're,
you're saying that you were basically 

463
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:34,350
just maintaining what made people like 
you to begin with what's the right,

464
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:35,880
but your channel hasn't really slowed 
down.

465
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,800
I mean it's not easy.
No,

466
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:40,650
it's not the center yourself and be 
like,

467
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:44,940
what I'm doing is good enough and keep 
doing it and just be stable.

468
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,590
Well that was always my mentality.
It was like,

469
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:48,300
sure.
It's easy to be like,

470
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,170
well,
if this keeps going,

471
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,870
I'll be a 10 million at this point.
But I mean,

472
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:53,970
no one knows what's going to happen.
So it was always a case of like,

473
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:55,230
okay,
these people are here now,

474
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:56,940
today.
So entertain them,

475
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,000
keep them happy,
be happy with them and do what you want.

476
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:01,380
If,
if you keep doing it,

477
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,620
obviously you're doing something right,
more people are going to come in.

478
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,840
I think that mentality of always like 
looking ahead of like,

479
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,100
Ooh,
I could get this amount.

480
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,830
That's a very slippery slope to go down.
Most definitely.

481
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,400
Um,
you,

482
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,443
we didn't fucking real and we are 
covering so much ground everybody and 

483
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,610
let me hit them with one of these.
Remember we'll still here.

484
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,750
You followed the Roseanne thing.
Not that we need to get into it.

485
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,584
I just thought it just through twitter.
Have you heard this was and I love that 

486
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,580
she actually say that.
Yeah.

487
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,140
I mean we thought a lot about it so I 
don't want to get repetitive,

488
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,890
unheard channel that happened when I was
on tour.

489
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:49,770
They recommend and we all woke up in the
tour bus and looked at our twitter feeds

490
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,450
and going,
oh no.

491
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,000
Well this was from her apology video.
Oh,

492
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:55,460
good apology Rosa.
Yeah,

493
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,560
I mean Christ listen clearly a very 
stable human being.

494
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,910
That was my first thought.
How do you like a touring you,

495
00:20:07,911 --> 00:20:09,180
you do a lot of touring,
right?

496
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:11,940
I mean you didn't seem to be on this on 
the road somewhat frequently.

497
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,243
Yeah.
We've got like two legs of the tour so 

498
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,290
far.
It's the same show every time.

499
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,140
But we can segment it out.
No,

500
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,480
I love live shows.
It's like,

501
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,110
like create her an audience in the same 
room together,

502
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,950
being able to do whatever the hell you 
want and then entertaining.

503
00:20:27,951 --> 00:20:30,610
I mean having that direct live feedback 
is so much fun.

504
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,310
I think that was part of the burnout 
setting.

505
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:35,880
Cause I did that and then I came back to
my video is alone in my bedroom.

506
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,260
It's like,
Oh man,

507
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,153
no one's here to listen right now.
And it kind of gets in your head is 

508
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:42,960
small bits.
So I had to reconfigure my,

509
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,160
my brain.
Right.

510
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,640
I never said that word before in my life
that I'm fully on board with that.

511
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,900
What do you do in your show?
It's like a,

512
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,440
it's like a 90 minute standup show.
So it's like a comedy show.

513
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,593
Um,
sort of about my life and then talks 

514
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:01,720
about my,
my childhood,

515
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:03,370
my teenage hood and my adulthood.

516
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,980
And so it's in three acts.
And then you talked about your childhood

517
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,890
and there's like good gaming memories 
from my childhood.

518
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:12,790
So you get people up to play a game from
your childhood and then that's insane.

519
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,320
90 minutes single man.
Yeah,

520
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,350
Shell,
that's crazy.

521
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,910
And Games are all about experience and 
overcoming your obstacles,

522
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:19,744
which life is about.
And then you move onto your next stage 

523
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:21,754
of life and you just keep going.
And she told some funny stories from my 

524
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,050
life,
I guess work.

525
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,790
Can people get tickets if they want to 
catch you?

526
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,950
Are there tickets available still?
You sure can.

527
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:31,810

529
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,050

Why not selfless promotion?

530
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,630
Not the eight.
Come on European tour dates.

531
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:41,464
Went on sale today.
Get your tickets to jazz show comedy 

532
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:48,030
world tour.
Here's me life filled.

533
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,860
We've,
we've done one live show and it was like

534
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,570
an amazing experience.
It was so,

535
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,220
it was,
it was magical.

536
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:55,120
Honestly.
In a way.

537
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:57,700
It was so intense.
How many people were there?

538
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,430
It was like 200.
It was like a small,

539
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:02,210
I mean it wasn't a lot of people.
I mean you probably,

540
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:04,180
what size,
what size you do.

541
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,853
Uh,
it's,

542
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,723
it's between like 1500 to 2000,
which is where we have to invent new 

543
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:11,171
sports,
like 600,

544
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:13,230
800 depending on where it is.
But yeah,

545
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,410
so we just,
we played a,

546
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,380
a comedy,
a store here in la.

547
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,910
Yeah.
Just to kind of test it out.

548
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,000
And I mean it was,
it was really amazing,

549
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:22,834
but it was just so much work and it was 
like so stressful putting it together 

550
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,463
because it was also live streamed.
We livestream is fit to go and set up 

551
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:31,810
all the cameras and do all this shit.

552
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,950
And I was like,
man,

553
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,400
but you guys did all that comfortable.
Yeah,

554
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,353
yeah,
yeah.

555
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,263
So I,
I work with the game grumps they have a 

556
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:40,480
20 kilo,
they produced it for you.

557
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:41,314
So you very much just,
you're able to show up and just do your 

558
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:45,904
thing.
So I just wrote the material and 

559
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:48,004
practice it and ever,
how long it take you to rehearse it and 

560
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:51,940
prep for,
for these weak,

561
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,540
you prepared it in a week.
Yeah.

562
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,000
But like how long to like memorize it 
and rehearse it and shit.

563
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,700
I mean it,
I never really like fully wrote it down.

564
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,370
It is scripted,
but it's kind of just in my head as I go

565
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:04,204
through.
How long and then how long before you 

566
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,340
did performed it?
A month I think.

567
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:12,140
And how was the first show?
Great Fun.

568
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,110
Touch the land.
And you didn't,

569
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,093
you didn't really rehearse it.
I mean I did in my head over and over 

570
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:19,600
again,
but not like properly out loud,

571
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,650
like start to finish it.

572
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,440
How's the snow?
Don't do that shit.

573
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Jesus Christ.
Fucking balloon animals.

574
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,830
Shit.
No stop.

575
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,760
How was your show evolve?
Because it's,

576
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,630
if it seems like if you'd just have it 
in your head,

577
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,520
it seems like,
is every show very different?

578
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,040
I mean,
how does that Pan out?

579
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,283
The life stories are all the same and 
the punchlines and everything are all 

580
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,193
the same.
But there's enough like Improv Room in 

581
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:52,580
between depending on the audience 
because the audience don't,

582
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,533
don't know what it is and they don't 
know what to expect or anything like 

583
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:56,870
that.
So when you start telling the stories,

584
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,610
different jokes land with different 
people.

585
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,500
So it's my farm.
And they're your fans.

586
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,370
They're,
they're good.

587
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,740
They're good.
They're very good crowd.

588
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,150
Yeah.
And this is what I'm saying,

589
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:10,730
like you guys did a live show.
Clearly your fans showed up to it.

590
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,630
Forgiving the barrier for entry is so 
much easier.

591
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,900
You're not going into a cold room.
You don't have to prove yourself to,

592
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:20,810
I know they're very easy.
You should want to put it on a good show

593
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,653
when something,
you don't want to just get up and shit 

594
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:25,610
on stage and have people cheer for you.
Well that's my next door.

595
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,450
Well,
right.

596
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,070
The shitting on stage just jerk off.
You're a cop on,

597
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,230
I call it circle jerking,
like get me a one vip.

598
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,320
Um,
but like when we do it,

599
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:37,460
it's the podcast,
right?

600
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:42,280
So it's different every time.
So the threat of bombing is,

601
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,870
is very much right there for me.
I'm bawling.

602
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:47,890
I'm bombing right now.
Do you,

603
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:48,724
do you think it's,
do you think it comes out of a fear of 

604
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:53,390
your audience?
No,

605
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,800
I just think I'm an anxious,
well,

606
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,350
I'm just an anxious person,
but part of why I'm,

607
00:24:58,351 --> 00:25:00,900
I'm going to get fucking therapy on your
ass right now.

608
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,263
Like we're,
where does your anxiety start and what 

609
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:04,820
from,
like what,

610
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,930
what triggers it to like kicking bro.
Waking Up.

611
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,873
But the opening my eyes,
there must be some like trigger factor 

612
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:13,664
to it.
Like you're afraid of not performing 

613
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:18,290
well or letting someone down or well,
not being funny.

614
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,420
I mean,
Eh,

615
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,510
you know,
uh,

616
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:24,230
it was pretty stressful.
I don't know.

617
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,310
I haven't,
you know,

618
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,280
I need to,
do you think your audience are here just

619
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:31,880
to watch you be funny?
They're there to be entertained,

620
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:32,714
right?
You know?

621
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,950
Yeah.
To a certain point.

622
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,300
But yeah.
I mean,

623
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,550
huge numbers.
People showing up consistently.

624
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,130
They're here for your personalities more
than anything.

625
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:43,670
So what you're trying to tell me is that
me just being me,

626
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,733
she says,
I'll hang up and being off and now 

627
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,770
you're telling me just being authentic 
is enough.

628
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,060
Yeah.
Wow.

629
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,290
That's fucked up,
dude.

630
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,001
Oh yeah.
Sorry.

631
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:57,240
Youtube 2018 be fake.
No,

632
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,020
I'm kidding.
No,

633
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,360
you're right.
I've just honestly,

634
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:01,180
I'm dude,
I got,

635
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,590
I got issues.
We all have issues,

636
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:06,290
man.
I have real youtube for a living.

637
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,690
I know I've always had really bad 
anxiety.

638
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:09,524
I have,
I had like generalized anxiety disorder 

639
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:12,950
in college that was like very,
very,

640
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,200
very difficult at that time and still 
carry a lot of that weight with me.

641
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,963
I don't know.
I honestly haven't really ever sorted 

642
00:26:21,201 --> 00:26:22,210
out my issues.
Dude.

643
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,750
Do you go to therapy?
No.

644
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,090
Probably should I got issues back plug 
years?

645
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,410
No,
it's fucking wonderful man.

646
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:32,210
You go to therapy?
I have started.

647
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:33,044
Yeah,
I've started for how long have you been 

648
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:35,390
going?
I've gone to,

649
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,400
well I've gone to one so far,
but oh,

650
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,600
you're like,
uh,

651
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,850
I want to go like a whole bunch more in 
there than here.

652
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,620
I have a bunch of friends who all swear 
by it and have like,

653
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:44,370
so you've gone,

654
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,870
when did you,
when was your first session?

655
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,210
About a week ago.
Okay.

656
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,123
And uh,
did you guys have any breakthroughs or 

657
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:52,860
what?
A little bit,

658
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,600
yeah,
really day one breakthrough.

659
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,280
Yeah.
Cause it's a lot about,

660
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,290
well I say,
I think maybe just the job we do,

661
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,473
they're this,
it's like talking a lot about balance 

662
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,183
and that was kind of a lot of stuff I 
came to terms with when I took a week 

663
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:04,081
off,
I was like,

664
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,820
yeah,
that makes a mess.

665
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:06,923
And I was doing that.
I had never been anxious before in my 

666
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:10,260
life.
And then in the last couple of months it

667
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,610
was like sitting down and all of a 
sudden like,

668
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:13,130
this swell and your chest happens.
I'm like,

669
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,940
I like,
this is what the,

670
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:16,530
what's going on?
It's like,

671
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:17,364
I don't like this.
The best line ever heard an eighth and 

672
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:21,300
eighth grade.
There's this great line.

673
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,190
She goes,
it's like,

674
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,620
you know,
before you get on the roller coaster and

675
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:27,870
then when you're done and you get off 
and then it goes away.

676
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,630
But it's like you never get the relief 
of getting,

677
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,710
being dumped.
The roller coaster.

678
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,320
That's how I feel all the time right 
now.

679
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,450
You're anxious right now.
Right now.

680
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,040
I might that intimidating.
It's not,

681
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,210
well,
don't flatter yourself.

682
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,570
She beat you.
She,

683
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:44,070
she,
she has abuse.

684
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,953
Yeah,
it should blink into the camera if 

685
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:48,750
you're unsafe.
All right,

686
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,510
let's take a quick break.
We've got a lot more to cover.

687
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,070
A lot more.
Good.

688
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,110
Let's get into it.
I'm very excited for the next topic,

689
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:57,510
so please guys,
do not go anywhere.

690
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,430
We will be right back with Shawn.
Make Laughlin your boy.

691
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,420
Yeah,
boy.

692
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,300
Oh God.
Ila.

693
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,663
You have to be a complete psychopath to 
be browsing the Internet these days 

694
00:28:11,451 --> 00:28:15,710
without a vpn because everybody is going
to be checking up your skirt.

695
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,870
I'm talking about advertisers,
I'm talking about ISP,

696
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,600
I'm talking about the government.

697
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,710
They're all trying to look at your 
privates,

698
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,610
right up the skirt and basically when 
you don't have a Vpn Ila,

699
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,100
you're letting them do it.
Okay?

700
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,930
Your browsing history,
everything.

701
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,780
Even if you're not doing weird shit like
looking at Hentai online,

702
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,733
Ila,
you're going to want to protect your 

703
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:41,420
privacy because who?
You don't want anyone having that data.

704
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,463
Express Vpn as easy as apps that run 
seamlessly in the background of your 

705
00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:47,060
computer,
phone or tablet.

706
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,570
You turn on express.
VPM protection only takes one click.

00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:00,464

712
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,043
I'm talking about desktop computers.
You don't want these crates having your 

713
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:13,874
data.

714
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,823
You know what I'm saying?
Like Amazon's got this and like all

726
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,070
would you put your Dick in some sleazy 
ass girl you just met at the bar?

727
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,750
No.
You put on a condom.

728
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,870
That's what express vpn is.
Strap up Ila.

729
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Let's forget for a second about the 
incredible vibrating features of Quip.

730
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,243
The incredible,
the fact that it tells you when he said 

731
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:23,140
let's,
let's forget about it for a second.

732
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:23,974
Okay.
Because we all know the quip is a 

733
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:28,930
incredible vibrating toothbrush that 
tells you how long you need to brush and

734
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:29,764
when to switch sizes.
We all know that it's incredible for 

735
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,274
that fact.
But here's what people don't know about 

736
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:37,990
quip.
That I think I need to tell the bristle.

737
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,360
Okay.
Is the softest.

738
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,553
It's the best.
It's so gentle on my gums but it's so 

739
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:48,490
strong on my teeth and I swear to God 
I'm not blowing smoke.

740
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,713
I've tried every toothbrush under the 
sun because I'm obsessed with oral 

741
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:53,344
hygiene and my mouth doesn't come out 
feeling as clean or as well taken care 

742
00:30:58,211 --> 00:31:03,211
of as this quip head cause it's got like
soft bristles and it's got rubber on the

743
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:07,930
outside and sometimes they'll go in 
there with the toothbrush and it will be

744
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:09,220
too irritating on my gums.

745
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,430
And that you do not want to mess up your
gums because let me tell you folks,

746
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,090
those do not grow back tree your gums,
right?

747
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,300
And that's what quip for me is all 
about.

748
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,400
Now we all know,
as I said,

749
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,353
that it vibrates.
It starts at $25 and it's pretty much 

750
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,360
the god of toothbrushes.
Okay?

751
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,433
But what you don't know is how amazingly
clean and fresh your mouth is going to 

752
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:36,910
feel after you use this fricking tooth.
Rosen,

753
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:38,110
I'm,
I'm telling you this.

754
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:38,944
I'm not,
this is the only toothbrush I'll ever 

755
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,300
use because it's the best and it's just 
that simple.

756
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,370
And the price is right guys.
It's quip.

757
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,353
If you haven't tried it,
try it now because your mouth fucking 

758
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,360
stinks.
It's disgusting.

759
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:51,850
Your gums are receding,
your teeth are rotting out of your head.

760
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:52,803
Try this,
give it a shot and see if it don't 

761
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,544
change everything for you.

762
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,683
I bet it will.

775
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:50,240
ticket to let you know if you're getting

back with Jack,
Septa Chi,

795
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:53,490
Shawn Mclaughlin.

796
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,310
That's me.
I like saying your last name.

797
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,870
You kind of looked at me when you said 
we're back.

798
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:00,510
Like I was supposed to say something.
I really liked the hearse.

799
00:34:00,511 --> 00:34:03,060
Something I really liked saying 
Mclaughlin.

800
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:04,440
It's a fun.
It's like,

801
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,770
hmm.
What's,

802
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:07,420
what's Sarah McLaughlin?
Is She Irish?

803
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,890
Spelled the same name?
I don't know how that is.

804
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,650
Oh,
and the arms of an angel?

805
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,513
I don't know.
I thought for some reason that was 

806
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,220
common knowledge.
No.

807
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,000
Okay.
Let's move.

808
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,930
Let's,
it's an Irish name.

809
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,430
Let's move quickly on this zone for a 
little bit long.

810
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,400
How many other Mclaughlin's are there?
So you're,

811
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:27,400
you are close friends with markup 
markiplier right?

812
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,161
Yeah.
You got it.

813
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:28,994
Make Long.
Got there.

814
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,580
How close are you guys?
Clothes?

815
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,970
Not as far as like the Internet thinks 
we are.

816
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,833
I was just going to say how,
I mean like do you guys say you guys 

817
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:41,150
have sleepovers?
No.

818
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,330
Okay.
Do you think we talk every single day?

819
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,680
Because what I was,
I,

820
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,653
I'm,
because the Internet is quite to the 

821
00:34:47,991 --> 00:34:50,030
contrary.
I'm out,

822
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:50,883
I'm gone.

823
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,833
There's this phenomenon on the Internet 
that is completely baffled me is that 

824
00:34:57,561 --> 00:34:58,394
there's fan fiction.
Have you and mark having like explicit 

825
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,360
Oh yeah.
Growth task.

826
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,290
Sexual encounter.
Pure sodomy.

827
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,220
I mean,
yeah,

828
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,260
absolutely.
Pure sodomy and worse.

829
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,513
Yeah.
Not there's anything wrong necessarily 

830
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,820
with sodomy,
although thought of me.

831
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,340
So I mean when you say it's sodomy mean 
it's like a violent act.

832
00:35:20,341 --> 00:35:21,174
So it almost sounds like,
is there anything like rapey about 

833
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:25,160
threatening,
let's just put it that way.

834
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,023
Right?
And because you can make love to 

835
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:31,871
somebody asshole,
but like saw but sodomy.

836
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,520
But sodomy implies something like 
nefarious.

837
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:35,990
Am I right or am I wrong?
Dan,

838
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,943
can you fact check the,
the definition of sodomy is sexual 

839
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:42,300
intercourse involving anal or oral 
copulation.

840
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,283
So you'd have a romantic sodomy.
We went from like anxiety and youtube 

841
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,420
and depression to fucking sodomy.
Basically what we've just established is

842
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:54,780
that I could sodomized you romantically.

843
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,820
Yeah.
It doesn't sound good though.

844
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,520
Doesn't sodomy totally sodomized this 
girl.

845
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:01,360
I saw them as though that over.
It was,

846
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,161
yeah.
No,

847
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,990
it doesn't sound,
it's just a style,

848
00:36:03,991 --> 00:36:06,810
right?
It's a lifestyle.

849
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,740
It's a way of living.
Well Padilla,

850
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,053
I like the breadth of work is in sand.
Like this is just trying to show the 

851
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,060
breadth here.
There's like just hundreds of fanfiction

852
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,060
here.
It's just endless.

853
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,130
What is going on here?
Well you know what,

854
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:25,790
hold on to that because again I think,
okay good.

855
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,160
It's gone well here.
No,

856
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:27,541
no,
no,

857
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:30,240
no.
You're not just going to put up Niqab.

858
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,910
Very vulgar picture are,
you know,

859
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:33,744
but I want to read just to excerpt so 
that the people at home can see what 

860
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,190
we're working with.
You proud of me.

861
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,960
Mine.
I started made it.

862
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,460
It's not you.
You're not doing it.

863
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,380
It's an interesting phenomena though.

864
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,180
And I want to get into it.
Okay.

865
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,330
You don't have your own fan fictions.
Nobody wants to fuck me.

866
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,260
No,
nobody wants to fuck immediately.

867
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,230
No,
seriously.

868
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:59,010
There's just like not at all.
Which is why this is so shocking.

869
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,633
I have like sex repellent.
Nobody wants to fuck me for better or 

870
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:05,424
worse.
He was the only one in the world that 

871
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:09,330
wants to fuck me and that's worked out.
What do you think it is?

872
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,850
What do you think people don't want to 
have sexuality?

873
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,320
Cause I'm just like,
I'm physically grotesque.

874
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,550
I mean,
first of all,

875
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:16,260
that's pretty much,
I mean like,

876
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,020
you know,
not that easy to look at first of all.

877
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,310
Well like,
you know,

878
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,380
bodywise you'd nobody wants to fuck the 
Pillsbury's doughboy for example.

879
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,430
I mean,
some soft song,

880
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,413
some people do,
but not the people that Russ Pillsbury 

881
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,930
doughboy romantic sodomy,
mantic sodomy.

882
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,000
So anyway,
here,

883
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,050
let me just read an extra Mckenna to put
you through,

884
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:42,720
but there's just this one.
It's just so powerful.

885
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,260
I started the Rus.
I start thrusting,

886
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:48,720
matching his balance shades of Jack.
When I hear,

887
00:37:48,721 --> 00:37:50,490
Oh mark,
I hit his prostate.

888
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:53,040
Good and hard candy.
Please hit that spot again.

889
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:55,950
Check practically screamed.
I hit his prostate again.

890
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:56,784
Again,
I jerked him off matching my thrust 

891
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:00,360
daddy.
I'm close me to kitten.

892
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,890
I mean,
it's just a trip to the bay.

893
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,480
Yeah,
I mean I'm their kin.

894
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,650
I hit his prostate one more time before 
he came in my hand.

895
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,250
Jesus,
not long after I released.

896
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,680
This is the last one,
so I'm not going to just let you know.

897
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,180
Not long after I released inside of my 
pullout of him watching my seed.

898
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,270
Like these people that are sick seed run
down his thighs.

899
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,790
I admire my work.
Find Synonyms.

900
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,590
Seed.
Yeah,

901
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:30,960
like that's just sick.
Like damn seed.

902
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,270
You don't,
you don't get your baby seat out now.

903
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:34,104
And then I get it out,
but I don't necessarily call it seed 

904
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,730
because that's just seems a little 
fucked.

905
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,280
I watched,
I pulled out and wash my seed,

906
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,100
run down his thighs.
I admired my work before he attempted to

907
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:50,560
stand up,
but fall right back down on the couch.

908
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,101
Ouch.
Yeah,

909
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:54,790
it's going to hurt for a couple of days.
Like it was a fucking Jackson pollock on

910
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,624
his thigh.
He planted some cz fucking blame the 

911
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:58,330
garden.
Yeah.

912
00:38:58,331 --> 00:39:00,910
It's going to hurt for a couple of days.
I say chuckling,

913
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,460
getting up from the couch.
I get a wet rag and help him clean up,

914
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:04,960
but it's totally worth it.
He says smiling.

915
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:05,770
Hey Jack.
Yeah,

916
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,000
I love you.
I love you too.

917
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,580
So this shit isn't,
there's romantic sodomy.

918
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,070
Yeah,
the definitely very definition of,

919
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,810
um,
full circle.

920
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,470
So what's going on here?
Is this like a mean?

921
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,200
Yeah.
Is this like,

922
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,580
I mean by definition probably,
but like what,

923
00:39:21,581 --> 00:39:24,130
am I joking though?
Or No,

924
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:24,870
no,
no.

925
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,170
A lot of this is not joking.

926
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,320
There's people who this is their sexual 
fantasy is youtube.

927
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,420
Don't get who's creating these years?
Creating this fens.

928
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,020
But like who,
if you imagine somebody who wrote that,

929
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:45,180
what do they look like in your mind?
It's fucking George or Martin.

930
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,680
Yeah.
Hunkering over his typewriter.

931
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:49,370
That'd be great if he actually wrote us 
off.

932
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,220
Fantastic.
He's the genius.

933
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:54,370
Find it.
Will you be upset if I pull up some art?

934
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,100
No.
Youtube might be,

935
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,031
no,
I pulled it.

936
00:39:58,031 --> 00:40:00,940
I took out all the protest stuff a long 
time ago.

937
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,860
This was,
this started getting very weird,

938
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,480
but we've been very vocal about,
oh,

939
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,760
some,
it's pretty wet.

940
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,110
Back to that one.
That one,

941
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,863
like,
as much as I don't want to do that with 

942
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:12,080
mark.
Um,

943
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,470
that is fantastic artwork.
Yeah,

944
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:17,160
absolutely.
Absolute dedication.

945
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,440
Whoever drew that good art style.
Oh,

946
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:23,320
you're holding a cookie that you drop 
once you embrace him.

947
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,633
Did you notice that are exchanging the 
cookie interesting detail that they 

948
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:30,190
would include a cookie and that this is 
old green hair.

949
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,690
Oh,
little nipple pinch.

950
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,430
You know,
I had to do it to him.

951
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,540
Had to do it.
Got Him.

952
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,320
Damn endedness crazy.
But I'm sorry,

953
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,250
I'm sorry to put you through this.
I'm just like,

954
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,280
there's something like really special 
here and that is just so incredible like

955
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:48,310
that.
This is a thing.

956
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,270
I mean the way I've always tried to see 
it as that at first me and mark,

957
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,120
obviously good friends,
we got along very well.

958
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:55,954
Once you start doing stuff together and 
you show that you have good chemistry 

959
00:40:58,121 --> 00:41:00,040
together,
like for let's plays and stuff,

960
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,050
this type of stuff I think is 
inevitable.

961
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,080
Um,
damn.

962
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,970
I remember that one.
I'm getting the fuck.

963
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:10,360
I really looks like a mark like that.
They're good artists.

964
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,253
I got to stay with me.
Well your face is obstructed by 

965
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,040
beautiful kissing motion.
Let me just cover it.

966
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,060
Let me just say,
Bro,

967
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,790
I'm,
I'm half Chubb Right now.

968
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,920
Damn.
Don't want me to make it a full job.

969
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,040
Difficult Pinch.
She wasn't no seed shit.

970
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,570
Oh that's all of them.
I know for the,

971
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,250
for the longest

972
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,083
time people used to do that.
Like we're like very heavily I me and 

973
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:42,110
mark said Okay Septa pliers a thing,
we get it,

974
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,480
please don't do anything explicit with 
it.

975
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,720
Cause it's weird.
It's not like characters from a book.

976
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,583
It's not like Jonathan Harris.
It was like people who actually know 

977
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:51,944
each other and get along and have a 
friendship and then they would do this 

978
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:55,964
and then it Kinda,
it Kinda died down for a while and now 

979
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:59,840
it's very open that we're not okay with 
it.

980
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,193
The whole step supplier thing we're like
please don't very much like don't do 

981
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:04,754
this.
Yeah.

982
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:09,110
Cause before it was like do it in like a
friendly bromance kind of thing.

983
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:12,030
But then people still kind of took it 
further and further.

984
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,480
There's nowhere like just just don't do 
it at all.

985
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,343
You get weird interactions in real life.
Cause I know you do your fence wood 

986
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:19,154
fence and I was like,
did anyone like bring something that to 

987
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:22,454
you?

988
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:26,450
People will yell stuff at us.
So like during some live shows,

989
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:27,284
if I talk about,
because there's a section in my life 

990
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:29,564
show where he's talking about something 
getting weird with like youtube 

991
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,850
popularity and someone yelled out,
Septa player at me,

992
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,000
I was like,
no,

993
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,780
stop kids here.
Um,

994
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,913
but yeah,
every now and then somebody will say 

995
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,980
something about it and it's still a 
thing on the Internet and everything and

996
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:43,814
people would still do it.
And I don't want to take away from 

997
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:47,840
people's,
if that's their outlet to create art and

998
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:50,660
that's how they really want to express 
themselves.

999
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:51,494
I don't,
I hate being the person to take that 

1000
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:56,120
away from somebody.
But you personally via violated it seems

1001
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:58,490
like,
but not violated.

1002
00:42:58,491 --> 00:42:59,324
It's just,
it's something that I don't think needs 

1003
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:02,120
to exist,
I think.

1004
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,930
I think it went too far and like jumped 
the shark too much and now it's like,

1005
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:08,840
well you can't see it without seeing 
that side of it anyway,

1006
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:09,580
I think.

1007
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,570
Right.
So I think that's why I'm Kinda like,

1008
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:12,800
yeah,
just don't do it at all anymore.

1009
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,010
Whenever anybody does something,
even if it's not explicit anymore,

1010
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,920
people will shit all over them and get 
bullied for and everything.

1011
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:20,420
And I don't want that to happen.
Yeah.

1012
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,500
Damn you can just draw us as friends so 
I don't need to be kissing all the time.

1013
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:27,140
Yeah.
Throw one of me and Ethan,

1014
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:31,370
I be fucking so honored you have fan 
fiction about sodomy fan art.

1015
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,170
I just need this episode if you guys can
drop me.

1016
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:39,610
Jack fucking I'm down.
I know about you but I doubt you have a,

1017
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,080
you have a free pass and this one,
uh,

1018
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,430
one saul,
don't worry,

1019
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:47,210
it's not going to become a thing.
Nobody wants to see me naked bro.

1020
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,990
You should draw Easton like super buff,
like just fucking ripped draw me as like

1021
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:57,530
a big gay bear because Donna's big gay 
hair,

1022
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,400
beard,
beard with bdsm chain wearing flannel.

1023
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,013
Nothing else man.
But yeah it did get weird cause then 

1024
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:07,610
anytime it got weird between me and 
mark,

1025
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,444
cause anytime we would hang out we'd be 
afraid of even like a friend can be 

1026
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:12,643
natural.
If there's a photo of you guys being 

1027
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:14,984
like,
hey then all of a sudden all of these 

1028
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:16,514
little,
yeah cause we did like a pax panel and 

1029
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:18,584
we were playing cards against humanity 
with Ken and Felix and it was some 

1030
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:21,674
moments where we like looked at each 
other and like had like phone 

1031
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,610
interactions will actually think that 
you guys,

1032
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:26,923
do they think that it's real or do you 
associate that people think that you 

1033
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:32,970
guys actually want it to be real but 
like,

1034
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:33,804
so they'll watch a video of you guys 
interacting and they'll see a moment of 

1035
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:38,250
you guys like catching us in the back.
I knew that they,

1036
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,330
and then there'll be like,
uh,

1037
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,790
like they're just hiding there.

1038
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,790
Bisexuality conspiracy.
It's like I miss that part straight.

1039
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,920
Does that bother you?
And you both had earned relationship,

1040
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,040
public relationships.
I mean it's not,

1041
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:55,680
and then like it's just,
it keeps going and going and going.

1042
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,573
Is that the part that bothers you that 
people think there's a conspiracy that 

1043
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:02,190
you are mark are actually in a 
relationship secretly?

1044
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,141
No,
I don't know.

1045
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:05,880
It's just,
it's just weird.

1046
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,733
Yeah,
there's a whole lot to it that's been 

1047
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,544
going on for like four years.
So there's not enough time for the 

1048
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,980
talking back.
And you do need therapy?

1049
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,450
Yeah,
absolutely.

1050
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,810
With me.
The a little couples there separately,

1051
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:20,750
they'd be like,
dude,

1052
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,040
shut up together.
You guys definitely need therapy.

1053
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:26,490
That's fucking weird.
Just the fact that we did that alone.

1054
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,100
Yeah.
Um Damn.

1055
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,950
It's fascinating stuff.
It's weird.

1056
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:32,853
The Internet,
it's crazy place cause I don't see 

1057
00:45:35,161 --> 00:45:38,790
fanfiction really about like on that 
degree about anyone else online.

1058
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,050
I don't know why it is that got you to 
so field up.

1059
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,360
Maybe it's just,
you know,

1060
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,930
there's maybe there's a subsection of a 
shared audience or something.

1061
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,450
I don't know.
It's like tumbler thing.

1062
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:52,284
Right.
I noticed you say you spend time on 

1063
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,840
Tumbler.
This is a tumbler phenomenon.

1064
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,170
This couldn't exist anywhere else.
I don't know.

1065
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,220
We'll see.
I'd like Tumbler Tumbler night.

1066
00:46:00,221 --> 00:46:02,040
Do you go on Tumbler?
I don't know what to do on Tumbler.

1067
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:02,903
What do kids do on time?
What did you do want to come by told 

1068
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,240
dude,
you tumble Bruh.

1069
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,740
Is where all the best fan or it comes 
from?

1070
00:46:08,741 --> 00:46:09,574
My okay.
And everyone's like very engaged and 

1071
00:46:10,841 --> 00:46:11,674
it's a,
it's an easy platform to like filter 

1072
00:46:12,571 --> 00:46:15,610
through I think where it's like 
everything else is typing in key word.

1073
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,570
How do you browse tumbler?
What are you doing on Tumblr?

1074
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:19,660
Search through.

1075
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,310
You have like a tag,
same as anywhere else.

1076
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,170
You just search through it and you see 
people interacting with the stuff you've

1077
00:46:25,171 --> 00:46:28,320
uploaded that I just think of like 
furries and like stuff like that.

1078
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,640
Well that's the thing,
like that's,

1079
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,390
that's definitely a side of timber and 
anybody who's out in timber,

1080
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,650
we will say the exact same thing and it 
pops up.

1081
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:36,000
You almost can't avoid it.
You're like,

1082
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,550
hey flowers for mother's day,
here's a,

1083
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:41,430
there's a brony taken it up the ass.
There's,

1084
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:45,120
there's porn bots on Tumbler.
So you'd be going through that like your

1085
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:47,400
regular self to be some fine arts,
some text posts,

1086
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:48,234
everything.
And all of a sudden it's like a picture 

1087
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:52,620
of a woman in a bikini saying she wants 
to have sex call her now.

1088
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,910
Really?
It's just like,

1089
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,773
wow,
okay.

1090
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,430
I don't know this woman or a metabolic,
it's another ones like one lick.

1091
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:00,840
My Pussy do it.
I'm like,

1092
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,063
oh,
right,

1093
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,620
sure.
Did you get her consent?

1094
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:05,663
And what was really weird about it?
Because you can tell it's just like 

1095
00:47:06,931 --> 00:47:10,320
instagram models or whatever and they're
just obviously bought.

1096
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:11,154
So they find pictures that got 
interaction or have semi-nudity or 

1097
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:14,394
whatever in it.
And then one time I was going down and 

1098
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:17,370
it was like a Jessica [inaudible] 
picture.

1099
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,930
I was like,
wanna fuck her,

1100
00:47:18,931 --> 00:47:19,690
do it.
And I was like,

1101
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:21,960
wow,
that was weird.

1102
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,220
Yeah.
So in like,

1103
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:24,054
I know her actually the,
actually this is a problem I've heard 

1104
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:30,250
about is that like people who make porn 
ads on

1105
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,920
the Internet,
they'll just grab any photo.

1106
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,690
Yeah.
Without any permission.

1107
00:47:34,691 --> 00:47:35,501
Because like,
Whoa,

1108
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:36,334
who are you going to do about it?
So we'll grab a photo of a totally 

1109
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:42,760
wholesome pretty girl from instagram and
then put her on porn hub,

1110
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:46,270
like fuck hoc,
local cuties or tinder.

1111
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,330
They're like catnip to people with 
somebody.

1112
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:52,660
That is so great.
And that's gotta be an we know probably,

1113
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,230
but it's like impossible to do anything 
about it.

1114
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,490
Yeah.
Crazy.

1115
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,900
Damn.
I'm,

1116
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,710
I got my tumblr account and I have no 
access to it.

1117
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:04,503
You're not tumbling.
I used to upload my art and I just 

1118
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:08,434
forgot my password one day and I,
it was my old email account and now I 

1119
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:14,620
just have no way to,
I mean tumbler is owned by Yahoo so it's

1120
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:15,960
a fucking mess.
Yeah.

1121
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:20,320
So they locked me out.
You ever tried to get back in and it was

1122
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:22,620
going on,
tried your best to get you in.

1123
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,920
You want to get back in and tumble?
Dude,

1124
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,540
wait,
how could you,

1125
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,080
is it linked to your yahoo account 
through the night?

1126
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:31,210
All the email,
which I don't have the password to.

1127
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:34,580
You were just fuck your life.
Yeah.

1128
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,483
It's called over healer.
Where are you going to catch your 

1129
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:40,840
Brownie for that?
Do you ever see anywhere part on Tumbler

1130
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,990
on your time there?
I did see like a,

1131
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:44,973
like randomly crawling.
I remember all of a sudden there was 

1132
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:50,350
born and I didn't even know where it 
comes to is a problem.

1133
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:51,970
Yeah.
That's an issue.

1134
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:54,310
Tumbler get one.
It was so long ago.

1135
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:55,970
I don't know if it's still the same.
Yeah.

1136
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:56,863
I was like,
I think it's always going to be the 

1137
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,230
same.
There's no way of stopping it.

1138
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,520
What?
You know,

1139
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,640
again,
like the thing that I see on tumblers,

1140
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,460
this furry porn.
Have you seen that?

1141
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,333
Can I just say,
I'm really glad that the episode you 

1142
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:11,000
start talking about furry porn on minute
that I have to be on.

1143
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,873
I mean,
do you want to participate in this 

1144
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:13,590
conversation?
We could skip,

1145
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,463
oh,
we're in it.

1146
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,453
We're in it.
Let's fuck.

1147
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,400
Because like I,
that's the thing that I just,

1148
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:21,160
I don't have the empathy as a human 
being to understand.

1149
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,330
I don't relate on an emotional base like
you,

1150
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:26,164
what you have,
I don't know if you guys have ever seen 

1151
00:49:27,461 --> 00:49:28,294
brony or furry porn,
but it's drawings of humanoid animals 

1152
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,520
with massive Cox.
I have never seen it come fest.

1153
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,860
Just nasty.
Just don't get it.

1154
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,150
Okay.
I don't let them explain this.

1155
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,540
Itemize each other.
Okay.

1156
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,190
Romantics,
Lisa.

1157
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:47,590
But if their lives are not harming you,
okay.

1158
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,490
You don't use tumbler but come holiday.
That's the stuff you do see on Tumbler.

1159
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,353
Yeah,
yeah.

1160
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:54,790
Fuck it all that.
Well,

1161
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,800
I've used it to the extent where I'm 
like,

1162
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,090
all right,
all right.

1163
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:02,620
Moroni downplay roney sodomy telling 
you,

1164
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:04,560
you don't have to fucking try that shit 
on there.

1165
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,080
You don't have to try.
All right,

1166
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:10,390
look,
Jack is Mr inclusive.

1167
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,850
He's going to stand up for fucking 
everybody,

1168
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:15,430
so I'm not even going to try to go.
I mean,

1169
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:17,200
you're allowed to have your opinion.
I just,

1170
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,200
I mean,
I don't see it,

1171
00:50:20,201 --> 00:50:23,350
so I was going to like,
I mean,

1172
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:26,470
you're welcome to live your life and I'm
not,

1173
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,393
I'm not going tell you don't.
But I also have one hand need to 

1174
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:34,010
acknowledge that that's fucking bizarre.
Like we can acknowledge like,

1175
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,810
dude,
keep doing your thing.

1176
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,120
Love what you're doing,
but also what the fuck?

1177
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,220
Right.
Like we can build,

1178
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,610
have both minds about it.
Right?

1179
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:46,640
I guess you January,
whatever isn't part of the southern part

1180
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:47,474
of the roadmap.

1181
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,130
This isn't on your Flowchart,
you know?

1182
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:54,500
But I mean,
if that's what you're into,

1183
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,020
maybe that's what people think is,
does that mean you want to fuck animals?

1184
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:58,491
No,
that's the,

1185
00:50:58,491 --> 00:51:01,880
that's the thing about it.
It's like there's so much like intricacy

1186
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:02,960
to it.
It's like,

1187
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:03,794
no,
I just want to fuck somebody else who's 

1188
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,410
dressed as an animal,
so don't want to fuck.

1189
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,293
And because in the cartoons they are,
they're not dressed as animals are 

1190
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,390
animals.
Right.

1191
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:16,130
And they have giant horse.
Cox did it.

1192
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,570
You know what I'm saying?
Well,

1193
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:18,620
I mean,
if you're going to draw yourself,

1194
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:20,420
you might as well draw yourself with the
giant horse cock,

1195
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,730
but they're are also horses.
Yeah.

1196
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,110
Okay.
I mean,

1197
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:26,760
I agree to me.
I don't get it.

1198
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,980
Okay,
thank you.

1199
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:28,903
I'm not,
I'm not,

1200
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:32,990
I'm not,
I don't know why I don't.

1201
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,160
I'm not,
I don't mind them.

1202
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:36,910
I'm like holding you to this book.
Plug tail.

1203
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:37,940
Yeah.
All right.

1204
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,840
That's a fascinating thing.
I mean,

1205
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:42,674
if you've never seen it,
go check it out on tumblr because it's 

1206
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:45,470
fucking wild ride.
It's a wild ride.

1207
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,500
It's a count on Tumbler Brownie Aisley 
Brownie experience on Tuesday.

1208
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:54,614
We're doing an episode and I'm this week
I'm going to show you brony porn on 

1209
00:51:57,321 --> 00:51:59,060
Tumbler and we'll report back on 
Tuesday.

1210
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,093
Okay,
great.

1211
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,550
Please text me if you want to look and 
call in if you want to call in.

1212
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,833
I love to true.
I'll come back for a second episode of 

1213
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:10,340
the podcast to talk about our only 
follows,

1214
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:14,450
we make it like a book club.
Interesting stuff.

1215
00:52:14,451 --> 00:52:15,830
Really.
So,

1216
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:16,723
um,
I love this or it's just so interesting 

1217
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,940
that,
I mean,

1218
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:20,923
your,
your channel got its first big break 

1219
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,740
from a puny pipe contest.
Right?

1220
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,350
That's an accurate statement.
Yeah.

1221
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,730
I have this clip.
It's really short.

1222
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:31,880
It's crazy that this is just the small 
little shout out.

1223
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,860
Okay.
Um,

1224
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,380
oh,
you're actually going to show this shout

1225
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:37,650
out.
Oh my God,

1226
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:38,503
man.
I don't think it's embarrassing or 

1227
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:41,780
anything.
It's really short fucking,

1228
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,370
I don't even know that he doesn't even,
he doesn't even show you.

1229
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,010
He just said it.
Yeah.

1230
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,220
Oh,
look at you in the corner.

1231
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,710
That's me.
Almost unrecognizable.

1232
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:50,820
Yeah.
Dance.

1233
00:52:50,821 --> 00:52:52,710
Sweet baby boy.
How old were you at this time?

1234
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,470
Uh,
2013.

1235
00:52:55,471 --> 00:52:58,440
So five years ago.
Three mm hmm.

1236
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,870
Cool.
Okay.

1237
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,410
How about the mothering fucking dad?
I didn't even know.

1238
00:53:05,411 --> 00:53:06,580
This guy.
Seems crazy.

1239
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,070
I really like that.
Whatever it is he's doing.

1240
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,530
He seemed really funny.
His name is Jack Septic Eye.

1241
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:18,380
You should check him out.
Check except the guy.

1242
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,090
What?
What,

1243
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,460
what was that like for you?
Well here's the thing cause there's huge

1244
00:53:22,461 --> 00:53:25,070
misconceptions about that because it's 
easy.

1245
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:25,980
Look back at me and Felix

1246
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,510
are friends and everything.
I look back and say like,

1247
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,570
oh that's how he became popular.
That's the secret.

1248
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:35,190
You just get a shadow competition.
But at that time I was at 2.2

1249
00:53:35,191 --> 00:53:40,191
k subs there and then after that I came 
home from college and it was at 15,000

1250
00:53:40,771 --> 00:53:43,170
subscribers,
which is fucking bananas at that moment.

1251
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,750
And then after like three days and went 
up to 20 k and then completely stopped,

1252
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,213
nothing happened after that.
And Christine and I had been doing like 

1253
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:53,154
grand theft auto five videos twice a day
for like a week and no one was watching 

1254
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:56,694
those either.
So the people who came from the shout 

1255
00:53:57,961 --> 00:54:02,790
out and kind of watch one video and it 
got like 15 k views and then just didn't

1256
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:03,730
watch anything else.
Everyone.

1257
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,633
And then people just stop subscribing.
It went from like getting 3000 subs a 

1258
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:09,890
day to a hundred right.

1259
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,600
And then it's like no one really watched
any more.

1260
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:14,670
So that that was,
that was the moment where I changed like

1261
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:15,504
everything I was doing and Tristan and 
became more of myself and just like 

1262
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:22,650
settled into the content.
So how long after the shadow was it,

1263
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,380
like what's the timeline of,
of the growth of your channel?

1264
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:30,030
Like in comparison is how long did it,
how much time passed from that shadow to

1265
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:32,880
the point where your channel started?
Like picking up traction?

1266
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,270
About six months,
I'd say.

1267
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,493
So it was after that,
that was September of 2013 and then 

1268
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:41,094
after that,
like the rest of the year passed and 

1269
00:54:42,511 --> 00:54:43,344
nothing was really happening.
Some stuff was still like residual and 

1270
00:54:45,121 --> 00:54:47,670
everything,
but I just like put my foot down.

1271
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:50,610
I started doing videos like much harder,
much better,

1272
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,623
a lot more variety.
I wasn't just doing the same game 

1273
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:53,784
anymore.

1274
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,760
The whole top of the morning thing 
became like a huge thing at that point.

1275
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:57,594
And then it was August,
2014 that the channel hit a million 

1276
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:03,120
soaps.
So it was like right after that,

1277
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:07,500
nothing really happened,
but it was the thing that instigated the

1278
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,240
passion in me.
So it was like,

1279
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:10,530
well,
here's this opportunity.

1280
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,760
I thought it would make the channel huge
and then it kind of died out real quick.

1281
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:15,511
And I was like,
okay,

1282
00:55:15,511 --> 00:55:17,520
well I need to do something I need to 
like that's,

1283
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,170
you know,
that is what,

1284
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,710
that's the beautiful thing is anyone can
get a shadow.

1285
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:27,390
Like it happens all the time,
but not everybody takes that.

1286
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,560
Yeah.
And shout to,

1287
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:31,690
into an opportunity to shout out alone 
doesn't get you to no.

1288
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:32,543
Yeah.
And Felix at 26 million subscribers at 

1289
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:38,310
that point,
fucking just dental is even back then.

1290
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:39,960
He was like,
yeah,

1291
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:43,360
so like five years later,
and I'm like six behind that.

1292
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,470
And it's like if you told that kid that 
that was going to happen,

1293
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,500
he would've lost his fucking mind.
Um,

1294
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:51,390
no,
but I think that that's the testimony.

1295
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:52,171
It's easy to be like,
oh,

1296
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:53,610
he got a shell from Pupae,
you know?

1297
00:55:53,611 --> 00:55:56,730
Of course he's got 20 million,
but like the shadow is literally,

1298
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,130
it's just like a little like it's like 
this.

1299
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,480
Yeah,
the little,

1300
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:04,170
it's important but like you have to 
take,

1301
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:06,540
and the analogy I always use is like 
your channels,

1302
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:08,340
your care.
Felix is the key.

1303
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:10,050
Turning it on,
get you going,

1304
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,390
teaches you how to like drive it or 
whatever,

1305
00:56:12,391 --> 00:56:13,224
but you're the one who has to like 
change gears and stay in lane and drive 

1306
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,374
down to the fly.
The way that shadow wasn't that ethic 

1307
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:19,350
either.
No,

1308
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:22,260
it was like very lightweight.
If you go through,

1309
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,113
there's a,
there's a couple of other channels who 

1310
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:26,590
he shouted out in that and there was 
another channel called illmatic.

1311
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:27,903
I remember who I thought was phenomenal 
because of his editing at the time was 

1312
00:56:30,611 --> 00:56:33,310
insane.
I think he's Australian and he got up to

1313
00:56:33,311 --> 00:56:37,000
like 11 key subs and then never went any
further.

1314
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,790
I don't know what his channel was that 
now I hope he's doing well.

1315
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:42,430
He'll manic shut up but are getting a 
shout out bro.

1316
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,340
Shout out from shouting,
getting a fucking,

1317
00:56:44,341 --> 00:56:46,210
it's shout out all day.
I know what it was.

1318
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:47,044
That kind of thing where I'm like,
well I want this to work so I want to 

1319
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:53,290
like put the effort in and get it going 
and see how far I can push it.

1320
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:54,893
Um,
and to get a shout out you kind of have 

1321
00:56:55,901 --> 00:56:56,734
to be putting the work in already.
Like he wouldn't have shouted me out if 

1322
00:56:58,211 --> 00:57:01,090
I wasn't doing two videos a day at that 
point anyway.

1323
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,930
Was there a point where you're getting 
feedback and you're like,

1324
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:05,823
oh shit,
they like what I'm doing cause I 

1325
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:08,530
remember I had a moment like that where 
you're like,

1326
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,730
oh fuck something.

1327
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,700
I'm doing something right.
Do you remember a specific moment?

1328
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:15,760
Yeah,
I think it was fairly early on.

1329
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:16,594
People obviously like the accent a lot,
but they like the energy and the 

1330
00:57:19,091 --> 00:57:21,900
enthusiasm because you kick it up at one
point were,

1331
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,043
I mean cause like you said that you took
the six months and you really focus on 

1332
00:57:25,421 --> 00:57:26,254
your content.
It was just something you changed where 

1333
00:57:27,431 --> 00:57:28,510
people were like,
oh that,

1334
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:29,710
that's good.
Do more of that.

1335
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,383
It was just a case of being more of 
myself because at that point I was 

1336
00:57:33,611 --> 00:57:37,120
trying to imitate like the metrics and 
the Felix to everybody else who was kind

1337
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:40,030
of doing let's plays at that point and 
then after that was like,

1338
00:57:40,031 --> 00:57:40,864
well I'm not going to get anywhere from 
somebody else that already has a 

1339
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:46,270
channel.
So I just started being more of who I am

1340
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:48,570
and talking honestly and saying,
yeah,

1341
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,930
that sounds really healthy dude.

1342
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,413
Fuck.
I guess being yourself not to take away 

1343
00:57:55,571 --> 00:57:56,404
from it.
I'm hugely grateful for the shoutout 

1344
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:58,443
Felix stage and I'm really glad that it 
happened and I would never take that 

1345
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:03,004
back.
I just think that there's some 

1346
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:07,210
misconceptions on the line of what that 
did and that's why everyone's like,

1347
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:09,250
you need to do a shout out competition 
now because Felix did one,

1348
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:14,260
I can see it being a little frustrating 
of being like you owe everything to this

1349
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:15,130
one shot.
It's like,

1350
00:58:15,131 --> 00:58:17,060
well that's really not what happened.
Yeah.

1351
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,100
And even Felix for like recently came to
me,

1352
00:58:19,101 --> 00:58:19,934
he was like,
do you want to like delete those videos 

1353
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:25,861
off our channels anymore?
Cause like it's like still a whole thing

1354
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:27,083
cause he knew that people were like 
shitting on me for that and say like 

1355
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:31,180
you're only popular because of this 
thing.

1356
00:58:31,181 --> 00:58:32,650
So that's so insane.

1357
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:34,840
That's so ridiculous.
Keep it there.

1358
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:36,280
It's a piece of history that,
but no,

1359
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:37,810
it's good.
Yeah.

1360
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,250
Live.
You'd go and watch it.

1361
00:58:39,251 --> 00:58:44,110
You can see it's like he's not like you 
need to go subscribe right now.

1362
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:47,640
Play your video.
It was like check the guy out and he,

1363
00:58:47,641 --> 00:58:50,000
he,
I think he was supposed to do the shadow

1364
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:50,834
of competition and then he kind of 
forgot about it and then he did it 

1365
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:56,600
really quick cause he came back from 
somewhere and then that's why he's face,

1366
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:58,990
this isn't even on it cause he just 
recorded the thing with his microphone.

1367
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,630
Unbelievable man.
Cutie Pie.

1368
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,830
You want a guy has on another level.
Yeah.

1369
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,053
And he's still five now.
The way we talk about like burnout and 

1370
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:12,050
shit,
he still posting every fucking okay.

1371
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,400
I don't know how he does it.
He must be deeply,

1372
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,800
deeply,
deeply damaged and miserable,

1373
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,960
but he seems really well adjusted.
That's what is the optimum?

1374
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:22,283
We're all damaged man.
I mean he changes up as content enough 

1375
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:26,750
to keep it fresh for himself.
So yeah,

1376
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,760
I don't like how well adjusted he seen 
it.

1377
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,673
I don't like it at all.
A psychopath and he doesn't care about 

1378
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:33,440
anything.
That's what I like.

1379
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:38,880
Podcasts.
Felix is a cycle.

1380
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:41,480
What's with the top?
What's the top of the morning?

1381
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:42,980
What's going on there?
Where'd that come from?

1382
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,160
Oh,
well if you go back and watch an earlier

1383
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:46,994
video,
my intro used to be hello all you 

1384
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:52,250
beautiful people out there helping them.
I was like,

1385
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,273
I wanted to,
yeah,

1386
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,890
I wanted to have like somebody else's 
voice.

1387
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:56,990
Mine.
I hated my accident.

1388
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:59,300
I didn't like look at,
they sell for anything.

1389
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,070
So my earlier videos have a different 
intro,

1390
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:02,630
different voice,
no face cam.

1391
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,350
And then later on,
like during that time I was like,

1392
01:00:06,351 --> 01:00:07,184
well I don't really like this.
And they started showing my face and 

1393
01:00:09,561 --> 01:00:10,394
then everyone thought I was American 
pretending to be Irish because me doing 

1394
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:16,160
that for probably sounded kind of 
Americanized.

1395
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,850
And then I was like,
well I want to show people I'm Irish.

1396
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:21,110
What's the most Irish thing you can say?

1397
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:21,943
And then an episode of friends,
Monica Says Tapa Dot Martin and tea 

1398
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:29,150
that's very Irish that it was like,
okay,

1399
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,850
I'll be as Irish as I can be in the 
first five seconds of my video,

1400
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,460
just as a joke.
That's fucking,

1401
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,130
and then people resonated with it.
I was like,

1402
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,790
if you don't make the first five seconds
of the video,

1403
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:39,140
you're not going to like the rest of the
fuck off.

1404
01:00:39,141 --> 01:00:42,710
So the great firewall,
that's interesting.

1405
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:43,544
Sorry.
So I can't really take credit for 

1406
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,080
friends.
Lots of generations of Irish people came

1407
01:00:48,081 --> 01:00:51,530
up with that.
How do are you famous in Ireland?

1408
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,830
Because like do you get recognized more?
You're the biggest youtuber in Ireland.

1409
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,160
Do you get recognized?
Do people know about you in Ireland?

1410
01:00:58,310 --> 01:00:59,650
Yeah,
they do.

1411
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,910
You say it like that.
Why do you say it like that?

1412
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:02,923
Cause when I was living in,
I was living in a small town that had 

1413
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:06,110
like 15,000
people in it.

1414
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,043
Yeah.
Like every time I went outside it was 

1415
01:01:08,571 --> 01:01:10,790
like get ready as I was like six seven.
Really?

1416
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:11,624
Yeah.
Wow.

1417
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,153
Cause just cause it's a small town and 
people know what you live there and 

1418
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:17,570
people are just out and about anyway,
depending on at the time of day,

1419
01:01:17,571 --> 01:01:18,404
obviously I want to have green hair.
It was just a lot more you bond over 

1420
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:25,841
payment in Ireland.
You're Bano famous pretty like household

1421
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:28,310
name honorary president of Ireland.
Pretty much.

1422
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:33,130
I think it probably president level.
Well what's,

1423
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,273
it's funny cause a thing that happened 
awhile ago was they did a list of the 

1424
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:41,060
top 10 most influential Irish people in 
like a tabloid paper.

1425
01:01:41,061 --> 01:01:41,894
It meant nothing.
But at number 10 was the president and 

1426
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:49,121
nine was Bano and then I was next to 
you're done,

1427
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,550
you're old news.
So it was really fucking weird.

1428
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:53,160
And I was like,
yeah,

1429
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,530
that's not,
that's,

1430
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,230
that is not a horn was right after me.

1431
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,711
I was like,
Hey,

1432
01:01:57,711 --> 01:02:00,320
no.
How do a Irish people feel about,

1433
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,180
about you?
Are they like,

1434
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:03,290
are they like,
hey,

1435
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,300
one of our boys?
You know what I mean?

1436
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:06,620
I mean,
what's the mentality like,

1437
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,090
hey,
it's very divided.

1438
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,150
Religious people can be the most passive
aggressive people you'll ever meet.

1439
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,530
They're super friendly and they're 
great,

1440
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:13,933
but they'd be like,
anytime somebody would see like the 

1441
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:19,860
thing about Irish people,
it was like you'd see somebody like at a

1442
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,680
person in la would see somebody like big
house in the hill and they'd be like,

1443
01:02:22,681 --> 01:02:24,630
wow,
that's what I'm going to work towards.

1444
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:25,740
We're an Irish person.
You'd be like,

1445
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:27,210
Oh fuck.
And doing well for himself,

1446
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:28,044
isn't he great hill?
And then you never talked to him or 

1447
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:31,704
anything.
That's a really funny and so some Irish 

1448
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:35,700
people are like,
yeah,

1449
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,220
he's out there representing the country.
And then those people are like,

1450
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,470
I hate that he represents our country.
And I'm like,

1451
01:02:40,471 --> 01:02:42,620
I'm not representative fucking anything.
Just don't like that.

1452
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,040
I can't even represent myself.

1453
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:47,380
What,
what,

1454
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:48,213
what?
That's so if you go like how much are 

1455
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:53,550
you going to recognize here in La is 
compared to like back in Ireland?

1456
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,110
Not nearly the same really because I 
think green hair.

1457
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,500
Yeah,
I expected the opposite to be frank.

1458
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,363
Really?
Well I don't know because like Isla and 

1459
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,810
probably the biggest challenge Israel,
right?

1460
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,510
Most famous Youtuber,
I don't know.

1461
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:13,040
But in Israel and no one knows.
No one really knows about bald.

1462
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:15,480
Well also I think it's the language 
barrier probably.

1463
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:16,803
Is You speaking Hebrew,
English obviously that's where we speak 

1464
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,380
to.
Oh I thought we were speaking Hebrew all

1465
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,214
this time.

1466
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,690
Do you remember,
was there a time where like,

1467
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,553
cause your channel at least from my 
recollection seemed to like blow up 

1468
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:33,630
really fast,
right?

1469
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:34,543
Yeah.
Was there like a month or like a period 

1470
01:03:36,991 --> 01:03:37,824
of time where you went from making like 
you know a couple hundred bucks to like 

1471
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,840
all of a sudden your income was like 
insane.

1472
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:47,360
Yeah.
It went from earning just enough to like

1473
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:50,910
get by each week to a point where was 
able to like go right an apartment,

1474
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:54,420
move out of my parent's place and just 
like what's the scope of time and like a

1475
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:58,510
month.
It wasn't like fucking crazy,

1476
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:02,400
but I mean at the time,
yeah it was,

1477
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,323
it was nuts.
It was like the difference between like 

1478
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:08,460
a hundred dollars a month to like six 
and a half thousand and I was like,

1479
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:09,870
I can move out.
Yay.

1480
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:12,420
That is sick.
I can actually rent a place.

1481
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:13,283
What were you doing before youtube?
You had a job where you going to 

1482
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:15,864
college?
Where did you see yourself going before 

1483
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:20,400
that you had this whole opportunity?
I went,

1484
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:21,263
I've gone to college twice really?
So I went to college for music 

1485
01:04:23,161 --> 01:04:26,520
production first and then like that,
it wasn't very good at it.

1486
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,500
I played drums and I wanted to learn 
more about that,

1487
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:29,334
but it was all about theory and how to 
fix electrical circuits and shit like 

1488
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:33,744
that and I didn't care.
So I left that and then it became very 

1489
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:37,644
depressed and miserable at home.
That's when I started youtube and then 

1490
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:41,483
went back to college for Hotel 
Management and graduated from Hotel 

1491
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,410
College.
You did?

1492
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:49,320
How many years is that?
Who it tell the call it three years.

1493
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:50,880
You're a fucking hotel manager,
Bro.

1494
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,760
Tray.
What did you learn that in?

1495
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:55,950
Hotel management?
Fuck all.

1496
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:57,803
You learn how horrible hotels are.
The whole time we were there they were 

1497
01:05:00,241 --> 01:05:01,590
like,
hotels are overworked,

1498
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,630
underpaid,
understaffed,

1499
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:05,700
and they're all losing money.
And we were like,

1500
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,780
cool,
I'll get my gym.

1501
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:11,781
Good effect that so weirdly specific and
then now you can learn that.

1502
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,540
So in in college when I was doing like 
the final semester,

1503
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,980
that's when that moment happened and I 
was like,

1504
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:19,263
I left college wants before I should 
finish this one out and get a degree of 

1505
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:23,014
some sort.
I don't know if youtube is going and 

1506
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:27,100
that thankfully it took off cause I 
don't to work in a book in a hotel.

1507
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:29,730
And you were living with your parents?
Yeah.

1508
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,960
How did your parents feel about the 
youtube pursue?

1509
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,220
I mean my parents have always kind of 
been supportive almost to a fault.

1510
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,710
They're one of the good ones.
Yeah.

1511
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:38,733
Well I to a fault,
I don't think you should give them that 

1512
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:41,224
much credit,
but it was just the case of like 

1513
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:43,504
whatever I was into they would just let 
me do and if I was passionate about it 

1514
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:46,924
they would.
Do you think if you are like now still 

1515
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:52,240
at 5,000
subs at home being a Youtuber,

1516
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:53,103
what would they,
could they still be like do your thing 

1517
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:56,920
or would they be like you need to fuck 
off,

1518
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:59,260
push out?
I'd say they'd be fine.

1519
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,850
DABS.
One other good one.

1520
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:06,400
That's pretty interesting.
Damn.

1521
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,800
They've been nice people.
Sorry.

1522
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:12,810
You're going to open your own hotel now 
all the way to the top of the morning.

1523
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:19,190
Cause like you've um,
what's the first,

1524
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,633
what's the first nice thing you bought 
when you started getting that cheddar 

1525
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,850
cheese and Guacamole?
I bought an ipad mini.

1526
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:30,520
That was the first nice watch game.
Grumps video is in bed.

1527
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,280
I used to watch them every day but it 
was on my computer.

1528
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:33,681
I'm like,
ah,

1529
01:06:33,681 --> 01:06:34,514
I wanted to watch it.
I didn't have a smart phone at that 

1530
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:36,880
point.
I was like,

1531
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:38,650
I want to watch them in bed.
So I bought an ipad mini,

1532
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:40,630
it was like 600 euro.
I was like,

1533
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:41,483
ah,
this is way too fucking much that 

1534
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,510
something like this.
I was like,

1535
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,870
well,
I'll even get the use out.

1536
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,660
And I went over like a month in my head 
being like,

1537
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:48,190
should I get it man?

1538
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:50,590
I don't know.
Then I got a needs that every night.

1539
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,360
Thank God I still have.
Nice.

1540
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,780
Yeah,
you use it.

1541
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,350
I don't use it.
Yeah.

1542
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,270
Yeah.
That's cute.

1543
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,730
It's a nice little remembering.
First thing we bought,

1544
01:07:00,731 --> 01:07:01,564
I remember the first thing we bought 
nice was the TV and we were in New York 

1545
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:04,773
and New York.
I bought like a 35 inch TV to him and I 

1546
01:07:07,421 --> 01:07:08,231
was like,
I never,

1547
01:07:08,231 --> 01:07:11,680
I never owned them.
We never had a duty for five years.

1548
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,330
And I was like,
I was like,

1549
01:07:13,331 --> 01:07:14,920
listen,
I had a pretty good month.

1550
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,620
I'm going to buy myself a TV.
Hell yeah.

1551
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:20,260
Drop that chat around it and it wasn't 
built.

1552
01:07:20,261 --> 01:07:21,094
You're actually,
it wasn't the one in the podcast studio 

1553
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:23,850
until we replaced it.
We replaced,

1554
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,353
yeah.
You got rid of your own piece of 

1555
01:07:26,321 --> 01:07:27,490
memorabilia.
Yeah.

1556
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,130
Well,
you gave it to family or they give it to

1557
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:31,510
who's,
who's someone took it.

1558
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,820
Ian's got it.
I'm not upset.

1559
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:33,703
I'm not sentimental until now.
You and I want my fucking tv back into 

1560
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:39,373
our bedroom was tiny and the TV was big.
We were in this tiny New York apartment 

1561
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:46,570
and I wanted a big TV dude.
I was crushing.

1562
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:51,340
It was like 500 bucks by like fine.
Like it was only the bed and the TV.

1563
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:52,810
I mean it's a smaller than.
Yeah,

1564
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,250
I mean it makes the TV look bigger,
right?

1565
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:55,090
Yeah.
Oh,

1566
01:07:55,091 --> 01:07:56,700
the TV was in normal.
I look at it now.

1567
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:57,880
List small.
I mean,

1568
01:07:57,881 --> 01:08:00,530
what's Nice as much.
This is like 65 smaller.

1569
01:08:00,531 --> 01:08:02,620
It was much smaller,
but like I,

1570
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:03,763
we watched,
we watched a lot of hits on directs 

1571
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:06,490
hunter.
Oh yeah,

1572
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:10,180
dude.
First Time washing that banger.

1573
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,490
Love that show.
I thought everybody was an anime.

1574
01:08:12,491 --> 01:08:13,630
I say,
listen,

1575
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:15,590
you've got to watch hunter x hundred 
people.

1576
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,424
Don't listen to me.

1577
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:19,910
People need to listen to me more.
This is your moment.

1578
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:20,744
Shouted out.
We tried to tell everybody for you 

1579
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,100
there.
Advocate.

1580
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:25,820
I'm a super fan.
Oh really?

1581
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,540
Are you,
do you,

1582
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,800
I mean,
what's your favorite anime?

1583
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,640
I don't know cause I had gotten into 
animate like very recently.

1584
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:33,500
I mean I watched like dragon ball when I
was younger.

1585
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:35,240
And have you watched hunter x hunter?
No,

1586
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,730
I know of it.
And then as a legacy to it.

1587
01:08:37,731 --> 01:08:40,730
But you said it like you've watched it.
No,

1588
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:42,590
I know it's,
I know it's probably decent.

1589
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:43,783
It's decent.
Give me a fucking break and I didn't 

1590
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,290
mean to fucking attack.
Okay,

1591
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,124
go right.
You're told me the brony bloaty like 

1592
01:08:50,641 --> 01:08:53,210
what do you watch?
My favorite is one punch man.

1593
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,880
Oh,
okay.

1594
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,950
One Punch is probably my favorite show 
of all.

1595
01:08:57,951 --> 01:08:58,784
It's his favorite.
Like I've watched it three times and 

1596
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,910
still rewind boy,
like every week.

1597
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:07,970
Every week he asked me,
do you want to watch one punch man?

1598
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:09,500
And I'm like,
Oh that was gone.

1599
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:12,880
And yes I have.
I don't,

1600
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,030
you'd have to leave this table,
but I don't want to read,

1601
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:15,864
watch the whole season 10 times.
I love it so much that I bought it on 

1602
01:09:19,671 --> 01:09:23,610
Amazon again so that I could watch it 
with the English dub.

1603
01:09:23,611 --> 01:09:24,444
So that felt newer,
cause I've watched it so many times it 

1604
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:28,100
wasn't shit.
No,

1605
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:29,730
I loved it in English.
Yeah,

1606
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,793
it's pretty good.
I ended an English and I took some 

1607
01:09:31,821 --> 01:09:33,890
getting used to,
but yeah,

1608
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,900
he's in two.
Got It announced.

1609
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,370
Yeah,
I just like it.

1610
01:09:37,371 --> 01:09:39,770
It's well animated.
The pacing of amazing.

1611
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:40,660
Great.
It's,

1612
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,960
it's got like the perfect show.
It's,

1613
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:46,700
it's doesn't take itself seriously Ila.
It's hilarious.

1614
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,143
Have you?
Yeah.

1615
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:54,530
It's a show.
You're in the minority here.

1616
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:57,150
I've watched it like three times to just
go.

1617
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:58,430
Yeah.
Thanks Dan.

1618
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,520
I'm not even that much of a super fan.
Yeah.

1619
01:10:01,521 --> 01:10:03,380
He,
he's in the minority of friends and this

1620
01:10:03,381 --> 01:10:05,540
is so perfect.
It's like,

1621
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:09,080
it's hilarious that the fighting scenes 
are the best I've ever seen.

1622
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,711
Yup.
So,

1623
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:12,470
well animated doesn't take itself 
seriously.

1624
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,170
Compelling characters.
Incredible action.

1625
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,123
Nonstop thrill rides while maintaining a
great heightened sense of humor all at 

1626
01:10:20,211 --> 01:10:23,120
the same time that I mentioned.
Great animation.

1627
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:24,403
Yeah.
Yeah.

1628
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,650
Well I can't wait until they come out 
into like a one punch man.

1629
01:10:27,651 --> 01:10:29,810
It's not the best that's actually attack
on Titan.

1630
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,000
Okay.
False.

1631
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:34,590
I liked that show.
I love attacking.

1632
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,130
It's not better than them.
I hate to admit this,

1633
01:10:37,131 --> 01:10:37,964
but I feel like all my favorite shows 
right now or anime it's cause there's 

1634
01:10:40,911 --> 01:10:41,744
good animals.

1635
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,960
No,
it's like the one on Netflix now.

1636
01:10:44,961 --> 01:10:47,180
If the little cat girl who gets Anglo,
I haven't watched that.

1637
01:10:47,181 --> 01:10:48,050
I've seen.
Is that a good one?

1638
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:49,310
Yeah,
I'll check it out.

1639
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:50,270
It's fun.
I mean,

1640
01:10:50,271 --> 01:10:52,040
I saw the picture,
I was like,

1641
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:55,160
I can't,
I'm not really my take my hero academia.

1642
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:58,800
We're watching a dude.
I'm all caught up in that shit.

1643
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:01,490
You want to get some superhero right 
now?

1644
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:04,700
Micro academia.
If I'm fucking,

1645
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:08,650
every Saturday it's on Hulu.
I'm like [inaudible] clearer calendar.

1646
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:14,640
And of course also baby.
I have to say the fight scene,

1647
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:16,710
but to I don't want,
I'm not going to spoil anything but like

1648
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:20,070
that epic fight scene between one of the
newer ones.

1649
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,270
Yeah.
But it's with all my,

1650
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:23,020
the villain.
Yeah.

1651
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:24,300
Yeah.
Oh my God,

1652
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:25,110
Dude.
I was like,

1653
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:26,930
I've so captivated.
Yeah.

1654
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,730
I watched that episode back to back 
twice.

1655
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:30,993
That's a good one.

1656
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,500
Damn.
Any broken?

1657
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:37,190
No hero fans out there know.
Um,

1658
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,410
um,
but I love all these shows.

1659
01:11:40,411 --> 01:11:41,244
But hunter hunter by far,
I mean in terms of like writing and 

1660
01:11:46,141 --> 01:11:48,570
music,
I mean the writing and that show is,

1661
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:51,150
is beyond anything I've ever seen.
It,

1662
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:54,830
it's like 550 ups.
That's a,

1663
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,020
that's a bit steep.
I mean,

1664
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,160
all good.
There's enemies like,

1665
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:03,240
like a one piece I'll never fucking dare
to get into because it has like 5,000

1666
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:06,410
episodes and it's still going like take 
a rest.

1667
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:10,250
I used to watch him to bleach and then 
it was like tried nothing is a choice.

1668
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,360
It's never getting to the end.
Give me a break dude.

1669
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:15,390
I need to know that there's an end in 
sight.

1670
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,940
That's why I'm like full metal,
full metal alcohol.

1671
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:19,330
Yeah,
that balance.

1672
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,380
That's my second favorite.
I him in on that.

1673
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:26,610
That was one of the first anime series 
we watched and I loved it.

1674
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:31,110
But I tried rewatching it recently and 
after becoming a fan of like,

1675
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,760
you know,
one punch man and,

1676
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:34,290
and,
and uh,

1677
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:39,620
hunter x hunter and I'm like,
don't love it as much.

1678
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:43,740
The original or Brotherhood though.
Brotherhoods obviously,

1679
01:12:43,741 --> 01:12:46,440
you know the more cherished one.
The good one.

1680
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:49,020
Yeah.
I don't know that it was a good judgment

1681
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:49,854
though,
cause I think you only tried like to 

1682
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:53,100
like just at the beginning.
Yeah,

1683
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,600
it's pretty slow.
Yeah,

1684
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,550
I guess so.
I still think it's up there.

1685
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:58,940
You know it's one of the best ones ever.
Yeah.

1686
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,660
Did the tea,
the tea,

1687
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:03,840
what's the tax rate in Ireland?
Let's get to what's really important.

1688
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,070
It's like 15% isn't it?
It's like 12 and a half corporate texts.

1689
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:09,143
Oh my God.
That's what you pay because you're 

1690
01:13:09,781 --> 01:13:10,770
probably incorporated,
right?

1691
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,510
Yeah.
Well I'm not in Ireland anymore.

1692
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,210
Oh,
so you're getting fucked by UK now.

1693
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:16,343
Was that a big change for you because 
that Ireland has like one of the lowest 

1694
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:22,620
tax rates of any,
what is it in the UK?

1695
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:25,230
It's probably right up there with it 
everywhere else.

1696
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:26,064
Like 40 or something 40 40 I don't,
I don't want to say out loud because I 

1697
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:31,890
can't remember it off the top of my 
head,

1698
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,310
but it's like much more.
Was that a big change for you?

1699
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,260
Yeah.
That's kind of painful.

1700
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:38,723
It's also just you have to control the 
fucking paperwork of moving everything 

1701
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:42,060
over.
That is so annoying.

1702
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:45,780
So you had to change your company to an 
English company or how does that work?

1703
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:46,703
Yeah,
it was just a lot of shit involved with 

1704
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:50,790
like creating like subsidiaries and shit
like that.

1705
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:53,790
Just to make sure everything was above 
board.

1706
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:58,350
I have fantasies about paying 15% tax 
rate.

1707
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:00,990
I wake up like,
oh my God,

1708
01:14:00,991 --> 01:14:03,600
I texted only 15% I'm like,
no.

1709
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:07,790
It was just a dream.
Oh here.

1710
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,950
It's like closer to 15 in California.
Just a,

1711
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:14,920
if you want to move to La,
you can be paying 50% okay.

1712
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,350
I'll keep that in mind,
man.

1713
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:20,500
Start saving up now.
They have enough of that tax bill.

1714
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:21,363
Can't wait to pay that army bill.
I mean 50% that's what you're facing 

1715
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:25,410
here.
I mean that's,

1716
01:14:25,411 --> 01:14:26,720
that's what's ridiculous about it,
right?

1717
01:14:26,721 --> 01:14:28,780
It's because we,
you don't really get much.

1718
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,590
Yeah,
yeah.

1719
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:34,210
No college and health care,
that's a whole rabbit hole.

1720
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:35,223
That's the thing,
because my editor is from Sweden and 

1721
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:38,340
everything over there is free.
So like free healthcare,

1722
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:40,720
free education,
you get paid to go to college.

1723
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,490
I don't get all these,
other than that,

1724
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,110
it's like a conservative talking point 
here.

1725
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:47,740
Is there like a socialism never works 
and it's like,

1726
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:51,700
what are you talking about?
Scandinavia is like a utopia.

1727
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:55,210
I mean it works out.
The social,

1728
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:58,510
the social programs,
it's not a shit hole country.

1729
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,110
No,
apparently no far.

1730
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,080
I mean,
no,

1731
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,170
I wouldn't say so.
But um,

1732
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:10,630
rmn well you probably don't want to get 
into politics political they made,

1733
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:14,823
cause I'm not thinking about politics 
and I'm just a person experiencing like 

1734
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:22,690
paying so much taxes,
but you don't get anything.

1735
01:15:22,691 --> 01:15:25,270
I don't know even why it's gotta be so 
political.

1736
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,021
Well,
it's like,

1737
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:26,854
I mean,
I guess it's something that I've been 

1738
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:28,444
thinking like trump wanted to have $100 
million military parade in DC and 

1739
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:38,110
meanwhile actual veterans aren't getting
healthcare.

1740
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:39,783
It's like what the fuck?
Meanwhile it's like you always get this 

1741
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:44,980
talking point of like,
how are you going to pay for it?

1742
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:45,843
You say you,
it's a very liberal talking point that 

1743
01:15:47,861 --> 01:15:48,830
you want,
you know,

1744
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,510
healthcare and college tuition free to 
whoever wants it.

1745
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:54,610
And they always say,
how are you going to pay for it?

1746
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:55,841
It's like,
Bro,

1747
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:56,674
you,
how are you going to pay for your $100 

1748
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:02,800
million military prey space force?
Damn.

1749
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:03,783
Let it out,
man.

1750
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:05,410
You know,
speak your truth.

1751
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,600
How are you going to pay for anything 
spilled?

1752
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:09,040
I political worry.
We're in debt.

1753
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:10,320
Trillions of dollars.
What do you what?

1754
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:11,163
Who's paying for that?
I don't know how I could figure it out 

1755
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:16,530
now.
They figured.

1756
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,370
Well,
the truth of the matter is that when you

1757
01:16:18,371 --> 01:16:21,310
have social healthcare,
it's actually cheaper than what the fuck

1758
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:22,630
ever.
Where have we have now?

1759
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,610
Because like,
well anyway,

1760
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:27,550
you're gonna have to drop a soundboard 
on now to break that 10.

1761
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:28,403
It's true.

1762
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,390
Maybe not the right one to drop.
So you get here.

1763
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:35,170
We will speak.
Got It.

1764
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:37,540
Let's do you have a lot.
Are these new,

1765
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,930
you just got your stream decks.
Alex Jones.

1766
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,660
I'm here.
This is my favorite.

1767
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:46,450
You're going like this?
Yeah.

1768
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:49,923
Oh,
you can just intersperse them the curb 

1769
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:55,960
theme every time I die in fortnight.
That shit.

1770
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:56,853
Really?
Yeah.

1771
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:58,450
You let carb.
Yeah.

1772
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,510
I haven't watched a whole lot of people.
What I've seen is good.

1773
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,200
Yeah,
that's great.

1774
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,970
Do you watch Seinfeld?
No.

1775
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,160
Is it popular in Ireland?
It's popular everywhere.

1776
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,100
It was like it came right

1777
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,730
before my time and then growing up 
friends was like the big thing.

1778
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:16,430
Yeah,
so I kind of missed the Seinfeld boat,

1779
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,830
but I do want to go back and watch it.
It's,

1780
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:21,750
I recommend it forced a few episodes on 
curved Daniel.

1781
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,580
Definitely in like Seinfeld.
You.

1782
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,590
How many tattoos do you have?
Do you have just one?

1783
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:29,750
Just the one.
I want to get a second one.

1784
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:31,700
This here.
I'll show the people here.

1785
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,920
You like massive blood.
One Tattoo,

1786
01:17:33,921 --> 01:17:34,641
right?
We have it right.

1787
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:36,530
You actually can show it.
Yeah.

1788
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:39,100
You don't need a picture here it is on 
the TV.

1789
01:17:39,101 --> 01:17:44,101
If you guys with directly or have you 
guys look on the TV here.

1790
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:45,710
There it is.
Wow.

1791
01:17:45,711 --> 01:17:47,960
It's so the likeness.
Uncanny.

1792
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:49,853
What?
What does the game mean to you that you 

1793
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:53,240
are so enthused about this game that you
were,

1794
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:54,590
you wanted to tattoo it?

1795
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:57,260
What is it again to people like me with 
don't know bloodborne.

1796
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,300
Dan's a big fan of it apparently.
Yeah,

1797
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,433
so what I've always kind of been from 
software and the people who make it and 

1798
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,690
I love dark souls.
I love dark souls.

1799
01:18:05,691 --> 01:18:07,580
Two,
three demon's souls and this,

1800
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:11,660
and then I always wanted to get a tattoo
anyway and it was in my head was like,

1801
01:18:11,661 --> 01:18:13,130
what the fuck am I going to get?
Nothing.

1802
01:18:13,131 --> 01:18:16,100
Reading means a whole lot to me.
And then this,

1803
01:18:16,101 --> 01:18:16,934
this I decided to get because you have,
you don't need to know a bloodborne is 

1804
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:22,850
to know what this is and I think it's 
just a cool design anyway.

1805
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,103
I was like,
well I want to make the leap and get 

1806
01:18:25,011 --> 01:18:25,844
something and then it's like my second 
favorite game of all time and then it's 

1807
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,033
first shadow of the colossus.
Well let's get a fat fucking tatted on 

1808
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:36,860
your face on my face.

1809
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:39,960
While I don't know you love it that much
more.

1810
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:43,340
I've never played that game,
but it looks amazing.

1811
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:45,500
I've seen footage.
It's so cool.

1812
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:46,513
Nice.
I played when I was a teenager and it 

1813
01:18:47,451 --> 01:18:49,670
blew me away.
When you poop,

1814
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:53,120
do you uh,
do you wipe forward or backwards?

1815
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,570
Front to back.
Front to back.

1816
01:18:56,571 --> 01:18:59,680
So you boast about you go like this?
Yeah.

1817
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:01,040
Okay.
What do you do?

1818
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:03,020
Listen,
it's a whole thing,

1819
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,120
but no,
I go fucking,

1820
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:07,670
I go back to front.
I go under the balls and I,

1821
01:19:07,671 --> 01:19:11,810
and so it's really a point of contention
contention here on this podcast,

1822
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:16,670
but it fucking weird shit into your 
balls,

1823
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:17,533
bro.
Aye.

1824
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:22,130
What if you drag shit up your ass crack?
Then you can just keep wiping,

1825
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:25,280
but do you yeah.
Well that's weird.

1826
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,560
I have control dog.
I'm weird.

1827
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:31,100
You Street shit up your ass crack all 
the way up called control dude.

1828
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:32,870
All the way up the back.
Leave a good sense.

1829
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:36,470
Or do you uh,
use baby wipes?

1830
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,390
No.
You go all dry.

1831
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:40,430
Yeah,
I mean if there's a,

1832
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:42,770
if it's a messy situation,
there's a sink nearby,

1833
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:46,190
you know,
was just like Dab it up with your hand.

1834
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,290
No,
the toilet,

1835
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:50,580
the toilet paper because it's wrong with
it cause I,

1836
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:54,620
well because I can't wet toilet paper 
cause it my assholes Harry and it sticks

1837
01:19:54,621 --> 01:19:57,960
to the hair and gets dingleberry's.
But you have a cloud.

1838
01:19:57,990 --> 01:20:00,470
Asphalt sounds like a fucking you 
problem man.

1839
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:03,830
No Man shall pass.
Do you shave your ass?

1840
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:05,570
I mean a little bit.
Yeah,

1841
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,190
I'm going to keep things but

1842
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:12,720
how do you schafly shave your asshole 
would very precise tools.

1843
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,710
What?
Tell me cause I'm,

1844
01:20:14,711 --> 01:20:18,090
I'm man that needs to learn.
I don't know man.

1845
01:20:18,091 --> 01:20:20,910
I don't want to like,
like dollar shave club.

1846
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:24,780
Could you use a racer?
No,

1847
01:20:24,781 --> 01:20:25,614
not that fucking weird.
That's what I'm concerned about because 

1848
01:20:28,111 --> 01:20:30,030
I don't how old baby you,
you,

1849
01:20:30,031 --> 01:20:30,811
you,
you,

1850
01:20:30,811 --> 01:20:32,880
you,
you manicure with scissors or what?

1851
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:34,560
I mean,
whatever.

1852
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:36,690
Whatever gets the job done.
Whatever's in the house.

1853
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:39,470
Hedge clippers,
lawnmower.

1854
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,370
Huh?
You know,

1855
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:43,470
so you don't use a razor and get it in 
there.

1856
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:44,423
No,
Jesus.

1857
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:46,890
That's what I,
that's what I imagined.

1858
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,740
But the thing is,
even if the assholes are short,

1859
01:20:49,741 --> 01:20:52,010
I feel like,
well I feel like it's still good stuff.

1860
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:53,970
I,
well I don't,

1861
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,860
the situation is clearly different.
What was it?

1862
01:20:55,861 --> 01:20:58,170
I could just be lying right now as well 
and dragging you down a rabbit hole.

1863
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,840
You're not lying.
I'm not lying.

1864
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,170
No,
I'm here.

1865
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,013
Yes.
Shaven.

1866
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:06,380
Just the thought.
Never crossed my mind.

1867
01:21:06,381 --> 01:21:07,500
To be frank with you.
I know.

1868
01:21:07,501 --> 01:21:08,334
I actually had guests here who they 
shaved their asshole too to help this 

1869
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:13,074
situation down there and I'd have to 
think that would be a huge life 

1870
01:21:14,521 --> 01:21:15,354
improvement for me,
but I don't really know how to get in 

1871
01:21:16,951 --> 01:21:19,200
there.
Do you put a mirror on the ground?

1872
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:21,810
Do you lay on your back and look at your
asshole in the mirror?

1873
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:22,710
I mean,
how do you do it?

1874
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,810
How'd you get the,
how do you get the vantage point?

1875
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:28,200
I think you just guess.
You guess it's like,

1876
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:29,500
what?
Like this?

1877
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:32,460
Do you have a fucking prolapse ass?
Oh,

1878
01:21:32,461 --> 01:21:35,280
but like hemorrhoid sticking out.
I don't know.

1879
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:37,410
It just seems like a more delicate job 
than just,

1880
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:40,800
you know,
blindly go and lady get it watches.

1881
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,080
Wow,
that's fucked.

1882
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,200
Just take a page out of Philly ds book 
and just jump into it.

1883
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:47,034
Just get right into it.
I don't think that's what he was 

1884
01:21:49,251 --> 01:21:50,850
talking.
It probably is.

1885
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:55,103
He seems like a clean,
I'm fascinated by this because 

1886
01:21:56,551 --> 01:21:58,200
everyone's said this is something that 
you know,

1887
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:00,150
generally isn't talked about,
but everyone has really,

1888
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,670
no,
we need male role models right now.

1889
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,060
Half of my audience are freaking out 
right now.

1890
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:06,890
I didn't need to know.
Yes you did.

1891
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:07,733
Fanfic just got a whole lot weirder.
Atomizing it after shave each other's 

1892
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:14,130
asses.
I didn't say that.

1893
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,260
Oh God.
It just give people ideas.

1894
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:20,370
Um,
one thing that I did pick up from having

1895
01:22:20,371 --> 01:22:21,204
this conversation I'd like to pass on to
you and actually some of our listeners 

1896
01:22:23,101 --> 01:22:25,590
who are probably waiting for updates,
metamucil,

1897
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:26,453
have you heard of that?
It's a fiber supplement made up this 

1898
01:22:29,461 --> 01:22:34,030
thing called Piss psyllium husks and it 
really tightens your,

1899
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:36,140
your shifts.
Yeah.

1900
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:39,780
And so I found that it's really,
it's been a great,

1901
01:22:39,781 --> 01:22:41,430
really great,
beautiful thing.

1902
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,810
Take a pop with a couple of those in 
your mouth.

1903
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:46,170
This fiber,
it's supposed to be anyway.

1904
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:47,910
Farber fiber.
It was just balanced.

1905
01:22:47,911 --> 01:22:49,970
You wouldn't be,
I'm slurry call it.

1906
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,720
How has it helped?
I mean sure,

1907
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:55,950
but it helped.
It helped euros all the time.

1908
01:22:55,951 --> 01:23:00,951
And Uros you're not from la?
No ghost.

1909
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:03,613
I'll call it Tulsa.
We shouldn't like a dream burger and 

1910
01:23:06,521 --> 01:23:08,450
burrito salsa note.
It's also,

1911
01:23:08,451 --> 01:23:13,120
it doesn't help you do what Irish people
fuck with spicy food?

1912
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,700
No,
actually I do.

1913
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:16,563
What do you mean Ireland?
Like what's the dish that like people 

1914
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,200
fuck with their yeah,
we don't,

1915
01:23:20,201 --> 01:23:22,130
we don't really have like traditional 
dishes out.

1916
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:24,850
Oh,
we to cover that down.

1917
01:23:24,851 --> 01:23:26,680
I'm going to lawsuits in here.
Yeah.

1918
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,380
Are we covered by insurance?
I think.

1919
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:30,490
I don't think we are.
I'm bleeding everywhere right now.

1920
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:32,500
Um,
no.

1921
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:35,950
Like lamb stew is like a big thing or 
shepherding my lamb stew.

1922
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,720
That sounds Dank.
It's pretty good.

1923
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:39,640
Really fatty cut of lamb.
Yeah.

1924
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:42,970
What?
Shepherd's Pie.

1925
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:46,330
I'm not sure I've ever had authentic 
minced meat with certain light.

1926
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:48,520
We've had that over like mashed 
potatoes,

1927
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,910
mashed potatoes on top,
on top.

1928
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:52,383
Cook it.
So it's like crispy on top pie crust on 

1929
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:55,990
the top.
No,

1930
01:23:55,991 --> 01:23:56,824
that's American.
That's something that they would do in 

1931
01:23:58,391 --> 01:24:00,490
America.
Like guilty for us.

1932
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:02,570
I'm going to add,
pick it up and off.

1933
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:07,950
Then it's a melted cheese on top whipped
cream right now.

1934
01:24:09,161 --> 01:24:09,994
I'm hungry.
That's what you get the shitty ass all 

1935
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:13,860
the time.
Exactly.

1936
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:16,960
But I need help.
I need help.

1937
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:18,940
I'm not kidding.
And let me tell you what,

1938
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,080
I'm not paying for anybody.
Aren't you supposed to be his carer?

1939
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:25,893
Fuck this shit in Ireland.
Like a and made of intestines and show 

1940
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:31,660
like blood put and you fuck with blood 
pudding.

1941
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,700
Hell yeah.
Black,

1942
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:33,543
black pudding.
I have blood that you eat basically 

1943
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:38,403
spices in it.

1944
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:41,980
She's good tank.
It's healthy or unhealthy.

1945
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:43,810
Oh,
woefully unhealthy.

1946
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,740
I'd say full of salt,
but it's so good that it's worth it.

1947
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,060
Yeah.
Put It on a,

1948
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:50,880
it's like a four Irish and say,
think of a better,

1949
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:53,770
like more enticing name.
What was called black pudding.

1950
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:55,090
Oh,
it's not blood pudding.

1951
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:56,360
No,
that's,

1952
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:58,990
that is what it is.
But we don't call it though cause no one

1953
01:24:58,991 --> 01:24:59,710
would eat that.
Yeah,

1954
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:01,240
that sounds so weird.
I mean,

1955
01:25:01,241 --> 01:25:03,640
you eat sausages,
which is lined with like,

1956
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:05,643
no,
I'm done.

1957
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:07,030
Yeah,
I liked it.

1958
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,210
Um,
do you have?

1959
01:25:10,211 --> 01:25:12,220
Well,
we've got pretty much everything sorted.

1960
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:13,430
Okay.
We got through the,

1961
01:25:13,431 --> 01:25:15,430
the sodomy,
the firies,

1962
01:25:15,431 --> 01:25:18,490
the politics.
He dropped a fortnight in there,

1963
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:19,451
right?
Yeah.

1964
01:25:19,451 --> 01:25:20,170
I'll put four,
nine.

1965
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:23,980
The thumbnail.
We talked about Logan,

1966
01:25:23,981 --> 01:25:26,290
Paul and therapy.
Logan.

1967
01:25:26,291 --> 01:25:28,540
Paul.
We talked about the suicide forest.

1968
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,840
Yeah.
Who's going to win that fight?

1969
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:33,003
Drop that in there.
August 25th we didn't talk about that 

1970
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:37,360
now and then I'll click bait.
I have talked about,

1971
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:40,270
oh we did this podcast today.
Not Today.

1972
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:44,290
Who Do you think's going to win?
I think Logan's going.

1973
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,950
When is he taller?
Does they have a longer reach?

1974
01:25:47,951 --> 01:25:48,840
What makes you think that?
Yeah.

1975
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:49,661
Yeah,
he's taller.

1976
01:25:49,661 --> 01:25:51,850
He just seems like he,
he's bigger.

1977
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:56,010
He's probably way more ways,
more like no case.

1978
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:58,480
He's like stacked and everything and 
he'd got into great shape.

1979
01:25:58,481 --> 01:26:00,190
But watching him fight Joe Waller who 
was like,

1980
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,160
well you only one cause joe didn't 
really fight.

1981
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:04,190
I haven't,

1982
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,023
I haven't seen that actual flight.
So that would be good to inform my 

1983
01:26:07,341 --> 01:26:08,174
opinion.
But a lot of times in boxing and 

1984
01:26:09,561 --> 01:26:13,970
fighting in general,
the bigger guy generally wins.

1985
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:15,133
That's why you have weight classes,
but these guys are probably not in the 

1986
01:26:16,641 --> 01:26:19,550
same way.
I don't have to Tyson Tyson,

1987
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:21,440
but they were in the same way class.
He was heavy.

1988
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:22,460
It was,
yeah,

1989
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:23,390
that's true.
Right?

1990
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,353
Yeah.
But Tyson was also like a fucking 

1991
01:26:25,281 --> 01:26:26,114
monster.
I just think just physicality will win 

1992
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:28,934
out.
And Logan used to do like wrestling in 

1993
01:26:30,621 --> 01:26:31,454
college and high school and stuff and so
I've always leaning towards case I 

1994
01:26:34,651 --> 01:26:35,484
simply,
because he had already had a fight 

1995
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,593
maybe.
But from what it sounds like not that 

1996
01:26:41,511 --> 01:26:42,344
valuable of experience,
but what I do think is that it's going 

1997
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:48,140
to be fairly boring cause they're not 
professional fighters is going to go the

1998
01:26:48,141 --> 01:26:48,974
whole length.
Nobody's going to get knocked out and 

1999
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:52,010
somebody's going to win on on a 
technical one.

2000
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,170
Yeah,
it's going to be,

2001
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:56,600
it's going to be best.
Oh we were wrong.

2002
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:59,210
Hopefully someone gets like,
mommy and I'll wash the,

2003
01:26:59,211 --> 01:27:00,044
I'm gonna Watch the highlights.
I'm washed the fuck out of the 

2004
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:02,054
highlight.
Or you're not going to get to $10 pay 

2005
01:27:02,661 --> 01:27:04,370
per view.
Is it only 10 bucks?

2006
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:07,120
I thought it was like 11 days,
$10 paper.

2007
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:09,800
Paper view doesn't pay the bills.
Come on.

2008
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:11,900
Why is that so a lot.
100,000

2009
01:27:11,901 --> 01:27:13,080
people watching.
Yeah.

2010
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,990
They're going to charge more than that.
I honestly have no idea.

2011
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:19,680
I didn't know what's going on with that.
Um,

2012
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:21,200
yeah,
well fuck that.

2013
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:22,083
We should just put money into a pot and 
see who wins that pays the bills if 

2014
01:27:25,851 --> 01:27:27,000
you're good at it.
Yeah,

2015
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:28,820
so we've pretty,
yeah,

2016
01:27:28,821 --> 01:27:31,100
I mean we've,
we've really covered every single thing.

2017
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:33,710
I was wondering that people are very 
religious in Ireland,

2018
01:27:33,711 --> 01:27:34,580
right?
Yeah.

2019
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:36,590
Are you religious?
No,

2020
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:37,453
I haven't been religious since I was 
like 12 I used to be an altar boy 

2021
01:27:40,281 --> 01:27:41,300
though.
Really?

2022
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:43,430
What happened?
Did you just like,

2023
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:45,170
I mean,
was there something or you're just like,

2024
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:46,023
Eh,
not for me.

2025
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,040
Yeah.
God got,

2026
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:51,050
it was so weird.
It was such a fucking woke 12 year old.

2027
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:52,970
Really.
I was like running down the field,

2028
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:54,760
playing around and then I just thought 
to myself,

2029
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:58,130
I cut very existential was like,
what if it's not real?

2030
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,460
What if God is not up there?
What if God is not one of us.

2031
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:04,370
And then I like went down this rabbit 
hole and I was like,

2032
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:08,330
I don't think I believe in God anymore.
On by on your own,

2033
01:28:08,331 --> 01:28:10,420
kind of do your own thing.
Are you,

2034
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,050
is your family religious?
Yeah.

2035
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,030
Oh,
am I gonna do they think about your,

2036
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,013
are you an atheist?
Would you consider yourself an atheist 

2037
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:20,470
or an agnostic or you just not,
yeah.

2038
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:23,240
What would you say?
I'd say more agnostic.

2039
01:28:23,241 --> 01:28:25,070
More for the optimism of it.
Sure.

2040
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,090
We're atheism is like,
no,

2041
01:28:26,091 --> 01:28:27,240
nothing exists.
Yeah.

2042
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,930
Like gnostic is like something might 
exist.

2043
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:31,460
Who knows?
Opened up my eyes to it.

2044
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:33,740
Yeah.
God isn't real.

2045
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:34,730
Changed my mind.
Yeah,

2046
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,450
exactly.
Um,

2047
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:41,500
how does your family feel about the,
your godlessness put my hedonism.

2048
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:45,560
My parents never really cared.
They didn't mind.

2049
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:49,400
They went to church and everything,
but I never told my grandmother that.

2050
01:28:49,401 --> 01:28:51,320
I didn't believe in God because she was 
very,

2051
01:28:51,321 --> 01:28:52,154
very religious and,
and I'd never knock on anybody who is 

2052
01:28:54,381 --> 01:28:55,610
like,
if you want to do many of their,

2053
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,473
it gave her like great peace of mind and
she felt a lot closer to things in her 

2054
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,220
later years,
everything so fantastic.

2055
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:04,910
But for me it just,
it didn't really make sense in my head.

2056
01:29:04,911 --> 01:29:05,744
Just say.
Hmm.

2057
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,610
Is there a growing like a among younger 
people,

2058
01:29:08,611 --> 01:29:10,700
that's probably a growing attitude 
though,

2059
01:29:10,701 --> 01:29:11,640
right?
100%.

2060
01:29:11,641 --> 01:29:12,474
Yeah.
I mean we're just legalized abortion 

2061
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:14,750
there at a couple of months ago.
Right.

2062
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,160
And that's cracked just a couple of 
months ago.

2063
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:19,140
Ironically,
America is going to,

2064
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:20,003
going back to making it illegal.
I mean that's huge for Ireland and like 

2065
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:27,150
same sex marriage is allowed there now.
And that was a recent development too,

2066
01:29:27,151 --> 01:29:28,140
right?
That,

2067
01:29:28,141 --> 01:29:28,974
yeah,
that was what that was within the time 

2068
01:29:30,451 --> 01:29:31,600
I've been doing youtube,
I remember that.

2069
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:33,600
Maybe like two years ago.
Hmm.

2070
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:35,011
Great.
I don't know.

2071
01:29:35,011 --> 01:29:38,910
The moving forward.
The whole world is so weird thing that,

2072
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:40,101
well,
it's not that word.

2073
01:29:40,101 --> 01:29:41,760
It makes sense,
but it's just interesting.

2074
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:43,360
Hmm.
Okay,

2075
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:45,360
but can we talk about religion?

2076
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,120
Talked about,
well,

2077
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:51,190
sex life shit.
How's yours?

2078
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:53,500
Yeah,
let's not get into it.

2079
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:56,050
What does that mean?
Now I want,

2080
01:29:56,051 --> 01:29:56,884
now let's get into it.
What's your relationship like with your 

2081
01:29:57,941 --> 01:29:59,560
parents?
Fine.

2082
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,570
Oh,
not bad,

2083
01:30:02,571 --> 01:30:04,780
huh?
It's fine.

2084
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:10,280
It's great.
My parents,

2085
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:13,010
whenever they come back,
they're fine.

2086
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:17,480
It's not like that.
How's your sex life?

2087
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,163
I'm talking about my fucking,
since you brought it up as a fucking 

2088
01:30:21,381 --> 01:30:23,480
meme,
you have a girlfriend,

2089
01:30:23,481 --> 01:30:25,700
right?
Long Story.

2090
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:31,190
I get it.
Huh?

2091
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:33,210
Do you have a girlfriend?
Right.

2092
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:38,190
Stop swords.
She's a white woman as a wife.

2093
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,590
Girlfriend now as well.
Yeah.

2094
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:42,930
No,
I don't have a girlfriend.

2095
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,630
I don't have any time.
What?

2096
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,640
I don't have any,
I mean together,

2097
01:30:47,641 --> 01:30:51,720
although I immediately fell sourcery for
me to have a side girl.

2098
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,020
Yeah.
I have to work quite impossible.

2099
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:56,063
I'll also add to the mix that nobody 
wants to fuck that maybe would make it 

2100
01:31:00,361 --> 01:31:03,040
even more of a feed there.

2101
01:31:03,310 --> 01:31:04,143
There's some people out there.
I'm sure some people in the comments 

2102
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:07,740
right now being like,
I would definitely fuck you.

2103
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:09,990
Yeah,
they're not out there.

2104
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:15,080
I'm telling you like married like very 
public publicly and you,

2105
01:31:16,321 --> 01:31:19,430
so you think people would want to fuck 
me.

2106
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,460
Shit.
Maybe fanfic.

2107
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,220
It's an idea.
I write one for you.

2108
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:28,140
That'd be sick.
What about me?

2109
01:31:28,141 --> 01:31:30,510
But I'll just in general I'd write one.
Actually I did it.

2110
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,373
I forgot I,
I noticed you sit in a video that 2017 

2111
01:31:35,521 --> 01:31:38,360
was the worst of your life.
That really stuck out to me.

2112
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:39,223
I was like,
Whoa,

2113
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:41,400
I don't know if you want to talk about 
that,

2114
01:31:41,401 --> 01:31:46,350
but I was really curious like what was 
going on in 2017 there's a lot of stuff,

2115
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,710
a lot of like youtube stuff and 
everything and trying to figure out what

2116
01:31:49,711 --> 01:31:50,544
I wanted to do.
Like that thing of like climbing the 

2117
01:31:52,081 --> 01:31:54,990
hail and then getting there and be like,
what else can I do it now?

2118
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:56,520
Yeah,
I'm feeling very aimless.

2119
01:31:56,521 --> 01:32:00,090
There was a lot of like,
like stuff with in my life that had

2120
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,010
changed very drastically.
A lot of friendships,

2121
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,760
a lot of stuff like that that had just 
gotten very weird.

2122
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,850
And then by the end of the year I was,
I just felt so drained and exhausted and

2123
01:32:09,851 --> 01:32:10,684
miserable.
I didn't really know what was going on 

2124
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:14,050
and that's why the whole like pma things
started cause I,

2125
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:15,423
I was going into this year,
I was like I'm going to make it 

2126
01:32:16,391 --> 01:32:17,224
positive,
I'm going to change my mentality and 

2127
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:22,300
just work towards a better me.
So what does PNA mean?

2128
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:25,180
Positive mental attitude and what does 
that,

2129
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:26,763
it's just something that kind of gets 
thrown around to be like keep it 

2130
01:32:29,261 --> 01:32:30,094
positive mental attitude and to me it 
was something that I could just keep 

2131
01:32:32,051 --> 01:32:34,330
saying to like remind myself to be 
happier.

2132
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:36,240
Like a mantra of something like that.
Not to,

2133
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:37,123
not to dwell on the bullshit that was 
happening that really meant nothing in 

2134
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:40,180
the grand scheme of things.

2135
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:42,500
And then because I kept saying a whole 
bunch,

2136
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:43,683
my audience obviously picked up on it 
and then it's become like a whole like 

2137
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:48,850
movement on my channel.
I was like,

2138
01:32:48,851 --> 01:32:49,750
okay,
I can not,

2139
01:32:49,751 --> 01:32:51,260
we can wear it around with me.
So you,

2140
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,870
you,
you feel that you were,

2141
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,033
you were able to willfully change your 
attitude by just consciously forcing 

2142
01:33:01,121 --> 01:33:04,870
herself to be more positive?
Not exactly cause I don't,

2143
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:07,360
I don't think that's healthy to just,
and that was the whole point of it.

2144
01:33:07,361 --> 01:33:08,530
I was worried that people would be like,
yeah,

2145
01:33:08,531 --> 01:33:09,364
just go out there and be happy.
If you're happy then nothing gets you 

2146
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:12,700
down.
So what bullshit.

2147
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,433
I appreciate that it's more complex than
it's about like it's going to sound so 

2148
01:33:18,071 --> 01:33:18,904
hokey.
It's about like trying your best to get 

2149
01:33:20,651 --> 01:33:23,980
to a positive mudding in the work to get
out of the hole.

2150
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,890
So for me it was a lot of like starting 
to go to therapy,

2151
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:27,813
like reflecting on things,
easing up on my work life and just 

2152
01:33:30,971 --> 01:33:31,804
having a better balance with my mental 
health and coming to terms because for 

2153
01:33:35,621 --> 01:33:38,470
the longest time I was like,
everyone sees me as the positive person,

2154
01:33:38,471 --> 01:33:39,304
but if I show any sign of like I'm sad,
then I was worried I was letting people 

2155
01:33:42,401 --> 01:33:45,130
down.
And then that creates anxiety and things

2156
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:45,881
like that.
So I was like,

2157
01:33:45,881 --> 01:33:46,960
okay,
I'm just going to be open,

2158
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,093
honest cause I'm going crazy.
It's gotta be a burden to be like that 

2159
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:53,050
positive,
happy,

2160
01:33:53,051 --> 01:33:54,760
energetic guy.
Yeah.

2161
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:56,770
And then especially when you have people
coming to you and be like,

2162
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:57,873
man,
there's like no drama on you and you're 

2163
01:33:58,721 --> 01:33:59,554
so happy all the time and people have 
nice things to say about you all the 

2164
01:34:01,391 --> 01:34:01,840
time.

2165
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,880
And that's just way too much pressure 
for any person.

2166
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:07,690
And it's not true.
I'm don't feel like I'm not that all the

2167
01:34:07,691 --> 01:34:09,310
time.
No one's perfect.

2168
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:10,600
Yeah.
Um,

2169
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:11,673
so then just don't try to re reconfigure
my brain again as you get to a better 

2170
01:34:17,021 --> 01:34:17,854
place.
And because it was a lot of stuff that 

2171
01:34:19,091 --> 01:34:20,410
was like,
that meant nothing.

2172
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:23,470
It was a lot of very tiny things to kind
of build up that mean nothing.

2173
01:34:23,471 --> 01:34:25,480
And then you get miserable about them 
for no reason.

2174
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:27,063
And then because I have so many people 
that come to me talking about their 

2175
01:34:28,691 --> 01:34:31,750
mental health all the time,
I figured that let's do something better

2176
01:34:31,751 --> 01:34:32,740
with it.
That's what we start doing,

2177
01:34:32,741 --> 01:34:33,574
the monthly charity streams and then 
this is like the Hashtag for it every 

2178
01:34:36,131 --> 01:34:40,270
time and try and turn it,
turn some turn things into a positive.

2179
01:34:40,271 --> 01:34:42,640
I think trying to work to a better life.

2180
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:45,010
God bless you.
I not,

2181
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:49,000
I'm an energy to be miserable,
sadly.

2182
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,160
No,
I'm in the same head space.

2183
01:34:51,161 --> 01:34:52,480
You are.
I really liked what you said.

2184
01:34:52,481 --> 01:34:54,250
It's not about like,
Hey,

2185
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:56,080
I'm happy now.
Yeah,

2186
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,313
it's about you have to make,
you have to like make the changes that 

2187
01:35:01,431 --> 01:35:02,264
you know you need to make to get there.
I think a lot of youtubers suffer with 

2188
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:06,554
that because they have everything they 
need technically or everything they've 

2189
01:35:09,831 --> 01:35:10,611
always wanted.
They haven't,

2190
01:35:10,611 --> 01:35:11,900
you know,
it's like why?

2191
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:14,570
It's like I have no reason and worst of 
all,

2192
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:19,920
a lot of the fans are people watch or 
like very judgmental about like what the

2193
01:35:21,201 --> 01:35:24,770
fuck that you have to complain about and
that's the thing when your,

2194
01:35:24,771 --> 01:35:25,604
when your finances are taken care of and
you're your own boss and you're doing a 

2195
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:31,340
job you love,
all that's left is emotional issues.

2196
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:32,653
All the things that you have left to 
worry about or stuff that's all in here 

2197
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:38,210
and your brain has a lot of shit to you 
that is not useful at all.

2198
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:41,570
And on top of that,
millions of people have an opinion about

2199
01:35:41,571 --> 01:35:42,404
you that you've never met and you have 
to be their advocate for their mental 

2200
01:35:45,201 --> 01:35:47,100
health a lot of the time as well.
And keeping,

2201
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:47,943
making sure they are entertained and 
keeping a check on them and making sure 

2202
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:54,050
people are okay.
And that's why like after awhile it gets

2203
01:35:54,051 --> 01:35:55,010
you.
But yeah,

2204
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:56,720
it's nobody can go out there and just be
like,

2205
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:57,613
okay,
I'm going to be happy today because 

2206
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:01,070
you're a fucking psychopath if you do 
that.

2207
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:02,210
Yeah.
Um,

2208
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,430
but as long as you're trying,
like if you have a shit day,

2209
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,110
it's fine.
Sit in Shit Day,

2210
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:06,953
allow yourself to feel shit,
get it out of your system and move onto 

2211
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:10,003
the next day.

2212
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:13,860
If that shit keep going.
If you have a shit month,

2213
01:36:13,861 --> 01:36:15,140
a shit year,
keep going.

2214
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:19,820
Eventually that day will arrive where 
you're happier and it all like,

2215
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:20,683
that's the thing.
Everyone always says that people get 

2216
01:36:21,231 --> 01:36:23,660
bullied in high school and then they 
grow up and it's like,

2217
01:36:23,661 --> 01:36:24,860
yeah,
that really meant nothing.

2218
01:36:24,861 --> 01:36:25,694
Did it?
Yeah.

2219
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:26,823
It leave some scars if it's bad enough,
but then at the end of the day it's 

2220
01:36:28,611 --> 01:36:28,881
like,
no,

2221
01:36:28,881 --> 01:36:31,550
you kept going,
you kept fighting and you're at a better

2222
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:33,830
place in your life.
God bless.

2223
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,710
I love it.
No,

2224
01:36:36,711 --> 01:36:38,000
I've been,
I've been seriously,

2225
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:38,953
I've been like,
I've been legitimately depressed for 

2226
01:36:41,151 --> 01:36:44,720
like probably two years and that we're 
just now I'm starting to like address it

2227
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:45,943
and that's part of why we're not posting
videos on each three because we were 

2228
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:49,453
just doing too much shit and I was like 
working every day and like it was 

2229
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:57,080
getting between me and Isla and you work
from home and hobbies.

2230
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:57,681
Yeah,
exactly.

2231
01:36:57,681 --> 01:36:58,514
Your free time and you're leisurely time
are mixed up cause you were from home 

2232
01:37:01,761 --> 01:37:03,140
and it's just so bad.
Yeah.

2233
01:37:03,690 --> 01:37:05,960
You know you can only take it for so 
long before you're like,

2234
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,333
I'm just going to have,
I'm just going to disappear forever or 

2235
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:14,050
I'm going to address this.
And that's the,

2236
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:14,893
I think that's the problem with 
youtubers is that when you're on that 

2237
01:37:16,491 --> 01:37:19,250
treadmill and you're constantly working 
towards it,

2238
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:20,084
you feel like if you fall off,
you're never gonna be able to get back 

2239
01:37:21,261 --> 01:37:22,790
on again.
It's really not true.

2240
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:23,511
No,
it's not.

2241
01:37:23,511 --> 01:37:25,610
And you can see channels like Shane 
Dawson who was,

2242
01:37:25,611 --> 01:37:27,770
had like huge popularity a few years 
ago,

2243
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:30,110
kind of,
he didn't disappear or anything,

2244
01:37:30,111 --> 01:37:31,740
but it's definitely not.
Yeah.

2245
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:32,490
Yeah,
I know.

2246
01:37:32,490 --> 01:37:33,680
It's huge.
Again,

2247
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:37,220
I mean the biggest he's ever been,
same with Philly d he was big,

2248
01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:39,020
went down,
that was huge again.

2249
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:42,140
And the one that's,
well those guys stayed active.

2250
01:37:42,141 --> 01:37:43,640
The one that always blows my mind is 
John Tron.

2251
01:37:43,641 --> 01:37:46,430
Like he doesn't even fucking post a 
video for a year.

2252
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:47,893
You know what I mean?
And he comes back and everybody's still 

2253
01:37:49,371 --> 01:37:51,170
there.
They'll excited for content.

2254
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:55,650
So it's very much that that myth has 
been busted.

2255
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:56,543
Yeah.
And that's why a lot of more youtubers 

2256
01:37:57,931 --> 01:38:00,330
are talking about it now cause they feel
like they can take a break,

2257
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:04,110
but I also take a break and it is really
hard to get back to it.

2258
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:05,213
Yeah,
that's one thing that like when you're 

2259
01:38:06,901 --> 01:38:08,940
in that treadmill,
uh,

2260
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:11,580
not to chase when you post a video of a 
week,

2261
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:14,880
or at least we used to do once a week,
it's Kinda like,

2262
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,340
it's just the routine and then once you 
break it,

2263
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:20,990
it's like even harder to get back to it.
I feel part,

2264
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:26,020
the problem for us is that you're always
chasing like a feeling or a time of like

2265
01:38:27,751 --> 01:38:28,620
how it used to be.

2266
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:32,070
Yeah.
Instead of just embracing like,

2267
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:33,720
all right,
shit's different now.

2268
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:34,963
[inaudible] you know,
I didn't mean that's the same for the 

2269
01:38:36,721 --> 01:38:37,554
audience.
The audience are still chasing the old 

2270
01:38:38,881 --> 01:38:39,570
use.
Yeah.

2271
01:38:39,570 --> 01:38:43,560
And I think they either mature with you 
or they leave and shit all over you.

2272
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:45,350
Yeah.
So you gotta just,

2273
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:47,123
I mean,
you've been doing it for how long at 

2274
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:52,821
this point you're not even the salons 
when you were five years.

2275
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:55,283
Yeah.
Every person changes like every three 

2276
01:38:56,701 --> 01:38:57,600
years.
So yeah.

2277
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:03,060
So I think part of what's really 
important for us is just to be like,

2278
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:06,360
okay,
that that air has done like as a new,

2279
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:08,730
it's a whole new era now because we 
keep,

2280
01:39:08,731 --> 01:39:10,200
we've always been like,
oh man,

2281
01:39:10,201 --> 01:39:13,350
I can't do this anymore,
but okay now I really needed to get back

2282
01:39:13,351 --> 01:39:17,040
into doing that again and then it's just
like this never ending cycle.

2283
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:18,413
Yeah.
Let's talk about finding balance and 

2284
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:21,930
stuff that makes you happy outside of 
your channel as well.

2285
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,393
That was like,
that was like the thing talking to in 

2286
01:39:24,691 --> 01:39:27,060
therapy I realized that I don't do 
anything outside of my channel.

2287
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:29,470
I don't do anything like physical.
Everything's,

2288
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:31,710
everything I do is mental.
Even if I play video games,

2289
01:39:31,711 --> 01:39:32,544
it's still keeping your brain on.
You need something to let your brain 

2290
01:39:34,801 --> 01:39:35,634
shut the fuck up every now and then.
That's something I've been thinking a 

2291
01:39:37,021 --> 01:39:38,700
lot to something.
It's like a whole,

2292
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:39,543
you need a wholesome activity to do.
Just distract your sending the fucking 

2293
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:47,370
real world like what do you do?
Do you have any hobbies outside of work?

2294
01:39:47,371 --> 01:39:48,870
In Games?
Now that I've come here,

2295
01:39:48,871 --> 01:39:51,660
I've just been hanging out with people a
lot more like living in Brighton.

2296
01:39:51,661 --> 01:39:54,790
I hadn't left my house and like two 
weeks cause I don't need to write,

2297
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:55,633
I have to keep,
my video is going and then when I came 

2298
01:39:57,181 --> 01:39:59,160
here I finally had people to hang out 
with day to day.

2299
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:00,810
They've just been hanging out with 
people all the time,

2300
01:40:00,811 --> 01:40:02,430
but it's just cleared my head 
completely.

2301
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:04,020
Nice.
Well not completely,

2302
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,490
no,
no ever fully clear.

2303
01:40:05,491 --> 01:40:07,290
But yeah,
compared to what it was,

2304
01:40:07,291 --> 01:40:08,124
I'm so much happier and then it makes it
easier to get back into your videos and 

2305
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,040
if you hate doing it the way you're 
doing,

2306
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:15,990
then that's a sign that something has to
change.

2307
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:16,973
Your schedule changes or your 
methodology changes or what you're 

2308
01:40:19,861 --> 01:40:20,694
actually doing changes.
And the bottom line is if you're not 

2309
01:40:24,421 --> 01:40:27,390
happy doing the old version of you that 
the audience wants,

2310
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:30,270
then it's not worth doing.
So you might as well do it.

2311
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:32,160
You might as well just do what makes you
happy.

2312
01:40:32,161 --> 01:40:33,510
And if the audience leaves,
they leave.

2313
01:40:33,511 --> 01:40:34,500
If they stay,
they stay.

2314
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:39,330
You got to make yourself happy first.
It's a tough pill to swallow,

2315
01:40:39,331 --> 01:40:40,430
but it's the truth.
Hmm.

2316
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:43,800
And something,
a lot of people don't want to swallow.

2317
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,420
Cut the tension.
Now we've really talked about everything

2318
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,010
we really have except one

2319
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,130
ghost stories.
Fuck yeah.

2320
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,850
Do you believe in ghosts or Ufos or 
anything paranormal like that?

2321
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:02,950
I want to,
I'm too rational.

2322
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,350
I don't,
it's fine.

2323
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,180
It's a weird thing.
Like we,

2324
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:08,703
we have a habit of asking all of our 
guests if you have any ghost or Ufo 

2325
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:14,320
stories that sometimes the answers are 
quite surprising,

2326
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:16,870
but a lot of times they say no and 
that's the end of it.

2327
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,690
Okay.
So you were full story.

2328
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:24,730
I mean not really a alien Ufo,
but one time I was out when I was like,

2329
01:41:25,010 --> 01:41:27,310
well no,
like eight to 10 years old.

2330
01:41:27,311 --> 01:41:28,144
I was out in my backyard in Ireland and 
we were all outside very late at night 

2331
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:32,583
in Ireland.
You can see all the stars because 

2332
01:41:33,201 --> 01:41:34,600
there's not much light pollution going 
on.

2333
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:35,883
And then all of a sudden my friends were
talking and I could hear this like 

2334
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:42,760
almost like a jet engine sound and I 
kept getting louder and I like looked up

2335
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:43,653
and there was a star in the sky that 
just got like whiter and brighter and 

2336
01:41:46,961 --> 01:41:50,470
then vanished and all of a sudden the 
sound was gone.

2337
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:51,690
And I was like,
that's a,

2338
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:54,310
I was an alien dude.
I just saw an alien.

2339
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,330
Huh?
How old?

2340
01:41:55,331 --> 01:41:57,130
Real eight.
Nine.

2341
01:41:57,131 --> 01:41:58,210
Did they see it?
No,

2342
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,320
and I feel like a lunatic thing.
I'd love to do that.

2343
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:05,080
That's been a,
that's cool.

2344
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:05,943
Were you guys here like the missile went
off that day and the gentle marbles and 

2345
01:42:09,141 --> 01:42:12,370
I can fill in where the ones that 
somehow like capture that moment.

2346
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:15,070
Did you see it in the air?
Actually,

2347
01:42:15,071 --> 01:42:16,660
no.
I just saw it all over the news.

2348
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:18,490
I think we may have been in New York at 
the time,

2349
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,170
right?
Oh right.

2350
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:21,813
But it was,
it just turned out with some missile 

2351
01:42:23,321 --> 01:42:24,154
tests,
some shit they didn't tell him that you 

2352
01:42:24,791 --> 01:42:28,960
want to see when you go outside.
Do you believe in ghosts and aliens?

2353
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:32,650
Don't believe there's aliens visiting 
there.

2354
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:34,330
Yeah.
I don't believe in ghosts.

2355
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:35,620
I believe there's aliens.

2356
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:38,500
They're out there fucking slamming away.
Yeah.

2357
01:42:38,690 --> 01:42:41,700
Fucking microbes going at it,
you know?

2358
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,960
But I don't think they're visiting the 
earth.

2359
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:45,520
I mean,
why would they want to?

2360
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:48,460
I don't know.
Who knows?

2361
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,490
I might just,
if they visited the earth were,

2362
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:52,960
where do you think is like the worst 
place they could land to be like,

2363
01:42:52,961 --> 01:42:55,780
fuck this.
Never coming here again.

2364
01:42:57,530 --> 01:42:59,110
Hmm.
That's a good question.

2365
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:00,790
Because like everyone's like,
oh,

2366
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:03,670
they'll come and they'll go to like dc 
or New York,

2367
01:43:03,671 --> 01:43:04,910
like independence day or something.
It's like,

2368
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,570
no,
it was a good end up in like,

2369
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:08,920
like Zanzibar,
somewhere too much anywhere.

2370
01:43:08,921 --> 01:43:11,320
It's just a shit hole over,
I mean to an alien.

2371
01:43:11,321 --> 01:43:12,154
They're like,
what the fuck is this dance in San 

2372
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,033
Bernardino?
They land in Greenland and there was 

2373
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,120
just no one.
Yeah.

2374
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:18,220
Is Weird.
Now.

2375
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:21,530
This is a very reputable Burbank's the 
fucking credit theory.

2376
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:23,980
There's this place sucks.
There's nobody here.

2377
01:43:24,190 --> 01:43:26,350
Nothing's popping off at bars or 
anything.

2378
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:28,390
Muscle beach.
I was just like,

2379
01:43:28,391 --> 01:43:29,620
oh,
I don't want that.

2380
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:32,223
All right.

2381
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:35,770
I had a lot of fun.
Me Too.

2382
01:43:35,771 --> 01:43:37,000
This is great.
It was a wonderful,

2383
01:43:37,001 --> 01:43:39,250
beautiful time.
I'm really glad we got the chance to sit

2384
01:43:39,251 --> 01:43:41,270
down and talk.
How did you think it was going to go?

2385
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:46,300
I thought it was going to be so awkward.
Kidding.

2386
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:46,900
No,
it's not.

2387
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:47,470
No,
I thought,

2388
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:49,570
I know you're a great guy.
I met you before.

2389
