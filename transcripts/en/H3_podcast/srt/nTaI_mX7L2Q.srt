1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,190
When it's like upside down.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,510
Welcome everybody to the second annual 
age three podcasts.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,880
Live Bonanza.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,110
Thank you Alex.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:18,963
Again with the usual suspects that 
Justin Roiling and Alex Hirsch together 

6
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,124
last year we raised $240,000
for direct relief and we are back again 

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,720
with the goofs,
the gaffs,

8
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:35,010
the laughs to bring you comedy.
That raises money.

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,030
It's all wholesome baby laughs and 
charity together.

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,670
Welcome.
Thanks for having us.

11
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:42,041
Yeah,
it's very,

12
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,140
very nice.
Thank you.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,590
Now if you want to donate,
there's so much to get to.

14
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:48,240
We have a fricken bananas

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,400
sit here.
I'm going to,

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,250
I'm not waiting.
I'm going to drink with my bag.

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,943
Justin

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,090
serenade,
everybody.

19
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,480
Now if you want to donate the link is 
into the description,

20
00:00:58,481 --> 00:00:59,314
but it's tilt to [inaudible] dot com 
slash they have an h three h three 

21
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:05,590
productions where I found strange.
I've never seen an ad in a url,

22
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:08,200
but there you have it work.
It works.

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,670
Yeah,
I mean I've,

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,570
yes,
it works.

25
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,780
It's in the description.
We have got so many prizes.

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,810
The prizes are.
Um,

27
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,250
let me go over these surprises to let 
you guys know what's on the line now.

28
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,100
First of all,
$1 is one raffle ticket.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,850
Now do not be confused that

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,020
he can,
I'm having flashbacks the last year.

31
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,300
Right now do not be confused.
One,

32
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,420
you do not have to donate multiple times
more.

33
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:45,421
You donate the more they can't.
They don't have the technology though.

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,890
Unsettling.
It's really creepy.

35
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,110
It's a little skin to animate doll face.

36
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,001
All right.
Sorry.

37
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:58,001
Go ahead.
I go ahead on a $1 equals one ticket,

38
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:03,440
$10 equals 10 rebels or you do not need 
to donate multiple times.

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,170
[inaudible]

40
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,410
the more the more likely it is that 
you're going to,

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,973
but even somebody who only donates a 
single dollar can technically when the 

42
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:11,400
pride,
correct.

43
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:12,770
Yeah,
but so you could be,

44
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,080
you're not to,
you're going to have to,

45
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,370
you know,
the odds are stacked against you.

46
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,910
If you only didn't have to kick down 
like a lot more than you might.

47
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,100
It's pot.
You could,

48
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:22,911
you could.
It's a,

49
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:25,500
if it's a possibility,
Justin's playing those mind games.

50
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,311
But I,
but I,

51
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,540
you know,
if you really want to win,

52
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,870
you've got to throw down to beef up 
your,

53
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:31,704
I'm hoping one of our prizes goes to 
somebody who donated a single dollar 

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,513
people who won donated large amounts.
But there was one person that won a big 

55
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,690
boy prize and I don't remember what it 
was,

56
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:43,524
but here we have,
was it the lint was skippy's was the 

57
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,590
lucky one that was,
you know,

58
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:49,424
I thought when I thought about flying 
skippy out so we could smell his real 

59
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:52,764
belly button,
like the source of the lint to kind of 

60
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,300
continue the story.
But you guys vetoed that one.

61
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,140
I mean,
I know I was like,

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,970
whatever you guys want to do.
But

63
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,470
no,
he didn't just like texts like,

64
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:05,230
hey guys want to sniff his belly button 
and we just like me and justin just did.

65
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,350
There was somebody else will get this 
one.

66
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,330
Somebody told her flat out.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,070
But I'll tell you what,
not to be outdone.

68
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,083
Last year we had one of the most 
powerful moments I think in live 

69
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:22,190
broadcasting history when Justin pepper 
sprayed joey salads and the face.

70
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,570
Yeah,
that was a beautiful,

71
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,404
wonderful thing.

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,353
Charity.
But did you feel spraying and other man 

73
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:28,690
of the fact that felt bad?
I worry,

74
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,703
you know,
as the years go on and we can tackle it 

75
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:34,020
like alluded tick.
Well you know,

76
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,110
I mean I felt bad but also I couldn't 
help you know,

77
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,050
laugh at the scenario but,
but the uh,

78
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,003
you know,
I feel like as the years go on and we 

79
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:47,740
continue to do this and hopefully the 
numbers that we raised grow,

80
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,560
uh,
I hope we don't end up killing joke.

81
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,613
You know,
cause I was coming up with all these 

82
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,071
things like,
oh man,

83
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,210
what if he,
you know,

84
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,044
we,
we get them like one of those really 

85
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,820
dangerous like,
like one wheel.

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,390
Well I guess it was,
those things are dangerous but some sort

87
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,224
of dangerous contraption to ride on a,
that's going to be really hard to do to 

88
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,970
produce and be like,
what if he falls and breaks his neck?

89
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,980
And then it's like,
oh I now he's paraplegic.

90
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,590
Not that there's anything wrong with 
that,

91
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,930
but I think paraplegic,

92
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,260
if he dies this year,
what are we going to do next year?

93
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,150
We got up,
we got to keep,

94
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,013
if he dies

95
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,350
charity foremost.
Yeah.

96
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,610
Yeah.
We need to make sure that um,

97
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,473
we have some

98
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,573
tissue samples,
sort of DNA that we can clone him 

99
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,450
because that technology is probably not 
too far down the line.

100
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,340
There's a good,
and then he's going to be puking today's

101
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,440
who will be collecting if we told them 
guys,

102
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:44,590
we have four milestones that we would 
like to hit during this live stream.

103
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,210
Twenty five thousand fifty thousand 
seventy five thousand a hundred thousand

104
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,343
every 25,000
Joey's going to be eating progressively 

105
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,110
spicier peppers.
Go ahead and cut to joey so everyone can

106
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,210
see what is going on in the backstage 
there.

107
00:04:57,211 --> 00:05:01,170
We've got a kitty pool set up.
Joey is sant milk.

108
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,740
Yes.
With milk whole,

109
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,960
what are we looking at?
Where are we right now?

110
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,800
I think it's the whole,
it's whole baby all the way.

111
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:08,634
And you know why not?
A couple of little little packets of a 

112
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:11,761
half and half.
Oh,

113
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:13,070
we can see.
Yeah.

114
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,730
Yeah.
We got the doc.

115
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,100
We're filling up the pool with the milk.
Now.

116
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:17,934
Joey is going to be eating a Jalapeno at
25 and how be narrow at 50 a ghost 

117
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:27,230
pepper at 75 and a Carolina reaper,
right?

118
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,290
75,000
does the Carolina reaper.

119
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,990
That sounds terrifying.
It's the spiciest pepper in the world is

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
it really surpassed but it whatever.
At a certain level.

121
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,620
It's like the crazy ones.
By what though?

122
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:47,050
I wonder if they keep them up her.
Oh,

123
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,580
pepper acts of course.
Eight tens of Grendel,

124
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:55,581
I believe it's called A.
Is that what they tend to at all saints?

125
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,750
Satan.
Sharp

126
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,771
crickets.
Yeah.

127
00:05:58,771 --> 00:05:59,604
Hit me up.
That's great.

128
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,450
Yeah,
for that.

129
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,500
Yeah,

130
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,333
so we're very excited.
We're very thrilled to be hitting these 

131
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:09,640
milestones.
Let me tell you what you can win because

132
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:12,640
we have some incredible prizes 
throughout.

133
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,720
Now,
first of all,

134
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,613
if you donate $100,
these are all on the prizes section of 

135
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:19,990
our donate page.
A hundred bucks.

136
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,090
You get to write something on Joey's 
body.

137
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,313
Anything you want that's not racist or 
that will get us banned from this live 

138
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:29,170
stream for uh,
for a,

139
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:31,180
uh,
how much is it to read on my neck?

140
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,873
Was it a thousand or 500 because we did 
this last year and we opened the page 

141
00:06:37,091 --> 00:06:37,411
here.
Yes.

142
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:41,020
Sworn it was 500 bucks to ride.
Her neck is 500 that's right.

143
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,080
So you guys can write on me.
Yes.

144
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,783
Let me show you this.
I might donate 500 this legendary shot 

145
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:53,881
was produced last year and this is sharp
sharpie.

146
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,910
So you have to walk around like that for
500 bucks.

147
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,270
Anything anybody wants could be written 
on your face.

148
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,580
Do they get to choose the part of your 
foot?

149
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,850
Whatever they like.
What about,

150
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:05,420
what about,
what about inkbox?

151
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,680
Like I have some inkbox free hand.
Like you know,

152
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,411
it,
it you,

153
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:10,244
you let it dry but it wouldn't show up 
until tomorrow and it lasted 18 days 

154
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,653
after the flood.

155
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,990
I was,
I would like for a certain amount,

156
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,090
you know,
maybe it's worth it,

157
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:24,881
you know,
it's just,

158
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:27,390
and I do have a life that doesn't sound 
though.

159
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,050
He might be up for it,
you know,

160
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:31,180
a little almost up to $5,000
guys.

161
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,400
So we are approaching our first,
yeah,

162
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,050
there's a bunch of cool stuff on the 
site and there's a bunch of rare,

163
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,700
well,
let me,

164
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,450
let me go ahead.
Yeah,

165
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:39,760
yeah,
yeah.

166
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,240
So you can draw on us now.
This one is super,

167
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:45,250
super amazing.
Um,

168
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,360
oh yeah.
You can buy,

169
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,710
you guys gonna be doing,
uh,

170
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,620
original art throughout.
Yes.

171
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,540
We bribed that.
We will.

172
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,410
We will.
But it's like,

173
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:54,244
I don't know how good it's going to be.
I figured we let something else right 

174
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:56,884
now,
but we'll be dropping somebody some 

175
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:58,700
sketchy ruse.
Yeah.

176
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,420
I figure we'll let we have frames,
you know,

177
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:02,890
for,
for what size paper is this?

178
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,060
11 by 14,
I guess.

179
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,850
Maybe not.
So we'll be creating these three amazing

180
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:09,550
artists.
We'll be creating art and as they finish

181
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:10,384
them,
we will throw them up for your bidding 

182
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,510
pleasure.
Or we could ask them like,

183
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:14,170
hey,
like,

184
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,480
which ones should we throw up?
Because some people would be like,

185
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:17,770
yeah,
sure.

186
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,480
I think we'll sell them all just okay.
Up Next Post Malone.

187
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,050
Was that,
uh,

188
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,450
rolling loud?
Is that,

189
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,310
am I saying that correctly?
Yes you are.

190
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,250
Thank you Dan.
Now Post Malone as you know,

191
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,760
has been smashing the quiet.
What do you mean?

192
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,700
Sorry?
It has been smashing a what?

193
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,330
I'm sorry what Justin?
I just said who rolls quiet,

194
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:38,164
you know?

195
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,430
Oh wait,
what did you go for it?

196
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,743
Uh,
what's that?

197
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,850
Double Cricket.
Yeah,

198
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,683
we dealt with that.

199
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,410
So,
so post Malone,

200
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,950
this was smashed just last weekend

201
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,570
during his show at rolling,
loud,

202
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,780
signed and,
and dedicated.

203
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,080
This is,
I truly believe a valuable part of music

204
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:07,980
history that we will frame 
professionally and sent to the winter.

205
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,540
So this is really,
I think,

206
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:13,260
an amazing donation by post malone who 
we think very much next up.

207
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,200
This is something amazing.
Justin,

208
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,073
why don't you go ahead and explain?
This is a rick and morty episode number 

209
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,480
one side by just rolling.

210
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,541
Right?
It's a comma.

211
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,600
It's the,
it's the first issue comic,

212
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,860
uh,
the cover I did and then I had seen,

213
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,210
I grabbed harmon to sign it and I signed
it.

214
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,370
So you valued this at,
I don't know.

215
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,204
It's weird.
It's like on Ebay they go for all 

216
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:37,740
different ranges of amounts.
I've,

217
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,310
I'm not kidding.
I've seen themselves for like $5,000

218
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,173
and that's what that might be the most 
I've seen itself without the signature 

219
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,490
of the creators,
like 2000 1500.

220
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,031
But,
but,

221
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,460
but honestly I think that's the low,
it's weird.

222
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:52,380
I haven't looked in a while so I don't 
know valuable.

223
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,200
It's pretty valuable on the Ada.
But with the two sick,

224
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:58,470
with both of both of our signatures,
definitely pretty rare.

225
00:09:58,471 --> 00:09:59,640
I've,
I feel like that should,

226
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,690
that should be,
that's a good one to two to raffle.

227
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,620
Oh,
that's there.

228
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,160
That isn't a premium premium price.

229
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,160
Go ahead and tell us about this because 
this also your fans have been going,

230
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,980
uh,
yeah,

231
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,780
Nana's for this.

232
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,710
So,
uh,

233
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,770
like for,
for any gravity falls fans or people who

234
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:20,470
have gravity falls fans in their family,
I'm watching,

235
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,770
like we released the gravity falls 
journal number three.

236
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:24,604
We've created this limited special 
edition where it has black light 

237
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:31,420
messages and like it's interactive and 
it's like this incredible book.

238
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,960
And there was so difficult to make it so
expensive that Disney was just like,

239
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,943
we're making 10,000
of these and we are never going to do 

240
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:37,984
this nonsense again.
Like we can't even believe that anybody 

241
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:41,704
would buy these because they're 
expensive and rare and hard to get 

242
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,680
ahold.
And they only made a few.

243
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:47,680
And then once they were done,
like for the past year and a half,

244
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,543
my entire twitter feed every day,
it's just people like where can I get 

245
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:50,944
another gravity falls during number 
three special edition cause there and I 

246
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,130
was like,
they're gone.

247
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,710
There's not another single one left on 
the planet earth.

248
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,560
There's only one left that I have and 
it's mine and I'm not selling it.

249
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,663
And then I was going through my stuff 
and I found one final journal number 

250
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,030
three special edition.
These have gone on Ebay.

251
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,520
I've seen them go for 4,005
Jesus Christ.

252
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:10,354
Really?
Yes.

253
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,170
And this one is rarer than those because
May,

254
00:11:14,171 --> 00:11:16,600
the reason this exists is because this 
was a test.

255
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,970
This was the very first test printing of
this book,

256
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,073
just to see if it would all work.
So I think there might be like a few 

257
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,700
like typos in there.
Like it's like it's a first,

258
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:25,930
first edition.
Wow.

259
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,000
It's unlabeled.
So it's like when you get a normal one,

260
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:30,280
it's like one out of 10,008
out of 10,000.

261
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,680
This isn't even labeled.
It's off the grid.

262
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,620
It's the rarest journal number that is a
real collectible.

263
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,700
That is a real heroes right here folks.
So,

264
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:40,870
uh,
so yeah,

265
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,250
just like everything else,
you know,

266
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:43,150
one,
$1,

267
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:45,880
one raffle ticket for $1,
you could win this.

268
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,720
It's totally possible.
Um,

269
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,150
but I'd,
I'd hedge my bets,

270
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,980
maybe throw some more data.
The throw in like

271
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,110
half the value of what it is,
what it would sell on Ebay for.

272
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,930
What do you think that would sell on 
Ebay for considering it's one of a kind.

273
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:00,764
I couldn't say.
I mean it's been like a year since any 

274
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:04,030
of these were available.
So,

275
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,810
but not to mention that's literally a 
production that's like the first one off

276
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,490
the presses.
Yeah.

277
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,323
Oh,
it's like when they make a stamp and 

278
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:12,850
there's like a misprint,
maybe only one of those.

279
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,390
Those are incredibly collectable,
like the,

280
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,040
the,
that stuff is accurate and I value it at

281
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:18,874
right.
That's like a prototype toy or 

282
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,710
something.
I won't lie.

283
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,813
I don't know.
I don't know if like signing it would 

284
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:23,614
make it less valuable if I should just 
include a signature with it or 

285
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,010
something.
Cause I don't want to mess.

286
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,050
Why don't we,
why don't we ask the winter?

287
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,620
Yeah.
We know what to choose.

288
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,170
Signed or not.
[inaudible] is not a bad thing.

289
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,030
I can't imagine the winter being like 
don't,

290
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,410
don't put it down and touch it.
And this is true.

291
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:45,390
When I found out he was,
Alex was bringing that I,

292
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:47,590
I was like,
you tried to trade up.

293
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,281
I was like,
listen,

294
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,490
I have,
I have seals of book three.

295
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:55,830
I'll treat you to auction off for that 
fucking one that wasn't even hitting.

296
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,033
I know,
you know,

297
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,610
it's an embarrassing sad.
You're a pro.

298
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,950
You're not too proud to,
I'm a,

299
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:06,920
I'm a fan and I am a collector so we are
at 6,200

300
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,110
guys.
Let's keep going.

301
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,070
Come on,
get it together.

302
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:13,660
We got joe sell ended up outside fucking

13.

315
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,250
I actually don't even know what a little
nip maybe cares.

316
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,801
It's like a,
you know,

317
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,360
it's like a private message,
you know,

318
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,410
a or whatever you want,
like a video that,

319
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:00,270
that Ross we'll send Ya.
And that's fair.

320
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:01,690
The tweet and God blessed.
Yeah.

321
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:02,051
And,

322
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,660
and Ross is great and,
and I,

323
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,110
I felt like that.
Oh,

324
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:05,771
awesome.
Yeah,

325
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:07,570
this will come in handy.
Um,

326
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,070
but yeah,
uh,

327
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,080
I figured,
you know,

328
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,943
he's,
he's got a massive fan base and I think 

329
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:14,464
that could help us.
Raise a good chunk of absolutely and 

330
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:19,660
thank you to both of you for coming 
together on that.

331
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,840
We also have a switch bundle with smash 
and that'll be signed by everyone here.

332
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,381
No,
I'm kidding.

333
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:27,214
I don't know [inaudible] we've got the 
xbox with fallout 76 damn brought this 

334
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:33,431
back.
I was like,

335
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:35,320
really?
You had to get the 76 bundle?

336
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,320
That being said,
it is the x box one x.

337
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:39,154
This is the premium top of the line.
New Console that won't lad like the 

338
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:43,084
Shitty one that I have,
but they sold me two or three years ago 

339
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,500
and of course we've got the PS four 
bundle.

340
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,130
That's that new bomb ass ps four pro red
dead redemption

341
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,390
get.
These are amazing,

342
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,920
amazing,
amazing,

343
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:55,754
really good raffle.
And then we realized there's so much 

344
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:00,470
more,
I can't even list it all,

345
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,710
but this amongst so many others is oh 
rick and morty original script.

346
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,060
We have four of those.
That's really amazing.

347
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:09,894
And I was going to tell you if we wanted
to kind of bundle some of the rick and 

348
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,640
Morty,
it's too late,

349
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,640
but I was going to say that it may or 
may not be too late because if we wanted

350
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:20,060
to bundle it,
you can just carry over the,

351
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,321
the,
the,

352
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,154
the,
anyone who bid on a certain item that 

353
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:27,360
bid could carry over for whatever bundle
that item goes to.

354
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,023
Does that make sense?
I don't know how complicated that would 

355
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:31,790
be,
but I just thought of that last night in

356
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,430
his mind.
But I mean,

357
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,350
it's probably more work than it's,
we have an Alex Hirsch message donation.

358
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,183
You,
are you showing your Dick or are you 

359
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,740
just saying stuff?
It's going to be a,

360
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:44,260
an audio adventure.
I'll be live ventures.

361
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,231
Uh,
yeah.

362
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:47,000
Uh,
for any gravity falls fans,

363
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,601
uh,
you know,

364
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:50,390
I can do any voice of any of the 
characters that I do.

365
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:51,890
I'm just like,
send me,

366
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:53,560
what message do you want me to say?
And uh,

367
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,870
as long as it's not like ridiculously 
places,

368
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,700
I will say it.
Um,

369
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,610
and uh,
yeah,

370
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:00,050
same is everything.
Raffle tickets for that.

371
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,900
Oh these are very frank are completely 
sold out.

372
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:03,734
Rep and dip X.
Justin's going to steal every fucking 

373
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,913
fine.
There's a ton of limited edition is who 

374
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,540
it is.
This call I will not be restocked.

375
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,600
I see some people are waiting for that.
It was a one time thing.

376
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,960
So these are the last ones.
Yeah,

377
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,100
that's it.
And then we have some,

378
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,023
I know teddy fresh one off samples of 
things we've tried and then decided not 

379
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:30,704
to go out.

380
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,560
Like for example,
let me show something like,

381
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,030
um,
you have the sweater.

382
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,890
We made these,
this happy like that sweater.

383
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,590
And so we,
we tested one an orange.

384
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,630
That's one of a kind that only exists 
there.

385
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,600
We have one in blue.
These are ones that we sampled but never

386
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:48,980
went ahead with.
This one's in blue.

387
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,120
That one actually.
That's pretty good.

388
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,691
Yeah,
that's really,

389
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:52,160
yeah.
I don't know why he didn't go.

390
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,030
I think maybe you might want to 
reconsider them.

391
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,040
Reconsider.
So it won't be that rare breed.

392
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,500
There's like this was another sample.
This is one of a kind.

393
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:03,080
It doesn't exist anywhere,
but that's official teddy fresh.

394
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,400
This one was a really interesting story.
We got this sample and then when I,

395
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,060
when we tried it on and took it off,
we really liked how the inside looked.

396
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,530
You can kind of see that's how we ended 
up making the rainbow one,

397
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,250
the new one.
That is basically,

398
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,920
it was based on the inside of this 
sweater.

399
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,970
That's cool.
That's awesome.

400
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,310
We liked it better inside out.
Well let's just do that.

401
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,440
Um,
and,

402
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,830
and so,
so much more.

403
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:32,720
You guys have to go over to the prizes 
page and see there's a fricking buttload

404
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:36,770
of amazing prizes to win there.
So with that being said,

405
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,780
in a couple more prizes,
[inaudible] 9,009

406

big donation,

407
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,460
We got to get Joey Salads

408
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,293

409
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,520
right?
Yeah.

410
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,640
Uh,

411
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,481
uh,
huge.

412
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:54,871
Huge.
Yeah.

413
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,310
We got a couple of like hundred dollar 
ones,

414
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:58,020
which is pretty awesome.
We're not people,

415
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,560
people are going to get shout outs for 
500 plus donations.

416
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,431
Yeah,
absolutely.

417
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:06,230
So thank you.
Um,

418
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,790
so

419
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,490
also guys,
if you're watching this on the Vod,

420
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,550
you can bid on all of these items for 
the next week.

421
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,340
They are going to be up.
So if you're not watching this slide,

422
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,540
rest assured you can still win all of 
this stuff by donating on the campaign.

423
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,210
Uh,
and the description.

424
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:27,930
So why are we doing this direct relief,
direct relieve beneficiary of this uh,

425
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,833
live charity event.
They are one of the highest ranked 

426
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,080
charity organizations in the world on 
charity navigator.

427
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,260
They are one of the only,
are they the only or one of the only Dan

428
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,960
uh,
rank charities 100 out of 109

429
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,000
transparency.
They are number one.

430
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,893
They are ranked number one.
So I imagine they are the only a a 100 

431
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:47,464
out of 100.
They have a perfect record on 

432
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:53,450
transparency and how much money actually
goes to people that need it.

433
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,020
Paying out executives,
it's like,

434
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:56,854
it can be so hard choosing charities 
because like all of them are doing some 

435
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:00,874
good,
but you don't know how much of your 

436
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:04,000
dollar is going directly to the people 
who need it.

437
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:08,410
How much of it is going into like 
printing fliers for the company and it's

438
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:09,244
like this one,
like every single rating system says 

439
00:19:11,531 --> 00:19:11,891
like,
yeah,

440
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:13,930
your money's going to someone who needs 
it immediately,

441
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,283
that dollar raffle ticket that might get
you this prize also is like directly to 

442
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,830
some of the,
it's also,

443
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,700
it's also they're,
they're going to be,

444
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:22,534
it's,
it's northern California and southern 

445
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,040
California right there.
Like hitting everybody.

446
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,791
Yeah.
Yeah.

447
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,624
Which is great.

448
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,503
Um,
and so,

449
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,810
and so we are doing this in honor of 
the,

450
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,673
of the tragedy,
the tragic loss of property and life 

451
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:40,850
that occurred here in California from 
the fires.

452
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,073
Actually,
I feel like a lot of people think about 

453
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,973
what happened here in California as just
a bunch of rich people lost their 

454
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,740
houses,
which is,

455
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:52,574
you know,
true as some and to some degree here in 

456
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:55,184
Los Angeles.
But what happened in northern 

457
00:19:57,951 --> 00:19:59,690
California,
in the city of Paradise,

458
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,310
this was not a rich community.
The 14,000

459
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:09,150
homes were destroyed,
the entire city was wiped out.

460
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,330
You can't really wrap your head around 
just how destructive that is.

461
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:13,770
Let me show you a video that,
I mean,

462
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:14,604
I agree,
but here I pulled up some media to kind 

463
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,110
of show you guys the scope of 
destruction.

464
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,950
So like this is the city.
I mean it's just gone.

465
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,350
Oh Wow.
That was a wall.

466
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,080
That's,
that's a Ariel.

467
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,050
Ariel.
God.

468
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,920
I mean it's gone.
One House.

469
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,130
Just here's dean.
Yes.

470
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,230
That would want hilarious.
Well not,

471
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:37,230
I mean,
I guess not funny.

472
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:38,700
I guess more this one.
Good.

473
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:40,470
Who's like,
as you're panning across,

474
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:41,910
destroyed home footage.
The phrase,

475
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:44,080
wouldn't it be funny normally?
No,

476
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,933
you're right.
You're right.

477
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,740
No,
it's fucking terrible.

478
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,220
Horrific.
Yeah.

479
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:48,730
My,
my,

480
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,100
my,
my partner at squatch games,

481
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:53,860
her brother lost every like everything.
Really?

482
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:54,340
Yeah,
yeah,

483
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,100
yeah.
It's like,

484
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,933
no.
It's like,

485
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,190
I don't know.
I keep asking,

486
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,480
but do you have,
it's like you do,

487
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,740
like everything is going well.

488
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,760
It's not like,
oh,

489
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,820
I have insurance.
Cool.

490
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,500
Get back to normal tomorrow.
It's like,

491
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,310
no,
you're,

492
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,390
you're,
you're,

493
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,523
yeah.
It's going to be about paperwork and 

494
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,360
also all the irreplaceable,
I couldn't even imagine.

495
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,950
Like I,
I,

496
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,783
we,
we were talking about like what would 

497
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,710
you grab if you had,
you know,

498
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,810
I don't know how much time,
like a couple of hours,

499
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:24,430
what would you grab and load up?
And it's like,

500
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,433
no matter what you're going to get out 
and the next several days you're going 

501
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:32,520
to be thinking of all the shit you 
forgot you're going to,

502
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,500
cause I have the worst,
that moment over and over again.

503
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,470
Oh my God,
I forgot to get the fucking whatever,

504
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,280
you know,
I don't know,

505
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,780
15 minutes.
What do you grab?

506
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,890
Obviously the dogs,
right?

507
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:42,724
Yeah,
I mean that's all I really care about 

508
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:46,680
books.
Like all my cash flow,

509
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,210
that's the first thing.
I'm just like,

510
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:51,660
I have years of original art and 
sketchbooks,

511
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,740
like going back to high school.

512
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,490
So it's like,
yeah,

513
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,910
like,
so I would grab all that if I could.

514
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,200
I don't even know where it all is 
though.

515
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,740
That's the thing.
I'm not ready.

516
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,650
I'm not ready to hire.
Like,

517
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,240
yeah,
you're,

518
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,890
it's like,
give me a second.

519
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,053
Maybe my laptop.
I probably would just because it's like 

520
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,750
there's too much shit on you guys.
Keep talking.

521
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:11,584
I'm just going to show foot.
This is somebody just driving through 

522
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,280
and then it might blow up.
Sex dolls obviously replay.

523
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,290
Irreplaceable.
I'm not going to leave them.

524
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,124
I don't know.
I don't know that I would grab anything 

525
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:26,780
but the dog and maybe my laptop.
Yeah.

526
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,313
Well my mom,
I think my mom rubbed off on me in a 

527
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,130
awful way cause like she would like 
throw out my childhood art like that.

528
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:37,390
It was like,
oh my God,

529
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:39,400
like an old receipt.
That's horrible.

530
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,610
Yeah.
Why would she do that?

531
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,050
Trust me,
this is a long,

532
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:46,990
long,
long time coming and I'm in therapy.

533
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:47,824
All right.
We just had a really true that I'm in 

534
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:50,764
there don't know that she would throw 
the rock art that I was super proud of 

535
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:56,410
that I made in high school and I left 
there.

536
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,873
I have,
I'll tell you what I haven't painted 

537
00:22:59,081 --> 00:22:59,914
since.
It's almost as tragic as this in a 

538
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:05,560
winton I in a way that's kind of helped 
because like I don't throw away a single

539
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,394
sketch book.
I have a closet filled with like every 

540
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:10,070
drawing I've done since I have like 
drawings from highschool.

541
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,480
Sounds like just like,
it's like I don't,

542
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,770
it's like I don't need it.
I can throw anything.

543
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,810
No,
I wish she didn't throw it away.

544
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:20,770
I wouldn't eat them.
Like tomorrow we gotta move Ileus,

545
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
pack a suitcase and I was like,
okay look.

546
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,780
Yeah,
yeah,

547
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,300
yeah.
Well I feel like I'm good.

548
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,680
That's good.
That's good.

549
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,530
I felt like healthier cause you know,
take it with you when you die.

550
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:30,364
You know what I'm saying?
There's certain things who just said I 

551
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:33,274
have no,
I'm not going to look out and I really 

552
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:38,920
don't care about like you can carry 
around everything you've ever touched in

553
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:43,540
your life or heard about or done or,
but like there's somethings that you are

554
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,040
going to need and the majority of it

555
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,260
you're never going to think about.
Even if you bring it,

556
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,094
like how much shit is in your house 
there that you will never even think 

557
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:52,910
about.
If it was gone,

558
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,620
you wouldn't even notice.
You know,

559
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,540
I liked who were arguing for like,
yeah,

560
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,750
it doesn't matter if you lose all your 
stuff in front of this mountaintop.

561
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,400
People losing their entire house.
Oh,

562
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:02,234
well,
I mean,

563
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,410
if you had a choice.
Yeah.

564
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:07,400
The difference between having everything
just blinked out is horrific.

565
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,920
Got a lot of media.
Does anyone know how these started?

566
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,020
These fires?
How did the campfire start?

567
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,410
Dan Fires,
right?

568
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,453
Well,
the problem is that it's just so windy 

569
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:19,100
and dry.
Yes.

570
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:20,880
It's the combination.
It's like you,

571
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,270
if you breathe wrong,
some brush,

572
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:24,104
you start a wildfire or it's,
it's a thing that's happening every 

573
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,640
single year now getting worse and worse.
The campfire specifically we believe was

574
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:35,500
started by our friends at PG and e 
company,

575
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,570
mother fucker.
But like I said,

576
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,810
you could almost just like take a,
a spicy shit and start a fire.

577
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,131
That's true.
But yeah,

578
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:44,230
some of their equipment,
uh,

579
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,240
overloaded and caused the spark and 
that's what started it.

580
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,890
I shouldn't eat.
Why chewing into the mix.

581
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:55,190
People talk shit about it.
We'll talk good about me.

582
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,870
Actually.
The problem is that he was,

583
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,370
a lack of rain was,
they're amazing.

584
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,000
There's no rain.
The Santa Ana's,

585
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:08,210
which are these,
we got rain like the week after like two

586
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:09,044
weeks after the,
it was like blood barely and not the 

587
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,930
why.
Knowing the worst.

588
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:12,621
It was like,
come on,

589
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:15,050
are you kidding me?
Now you're going to rain.

590
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:15,861
Well then they're like,
oh,

591
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:17,420
the mudslides,
they're going to fuck everyone up.

592
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,680
Will that,
exactly.

593
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:19,670
It's like a,
it's,

594
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,160
yeah,
on the whole everything is super dry and

595
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:27,161
then you get the Santa Ana's which are 
these really warm dry wins and it's just

596
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:32,010
a fatal combination by the way.
We don't know.

597
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,320
We don't know that much about it.
That's all that we,

598
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:38,270
he doesn't know what he's talking about.
Thank you Justin.

599
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,104
Appreciate that.
If you can just keep on supporting me 

600
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,230
throughout the,
just to make sure.

601
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,360
Have we explained what the Fuck Justin's
up?

602
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,830
No.
What are you doing?

603
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:50,664
I'm doing um,
I don't know if the camera could see 

604
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:54,440
this.
Justin has laid out over the table.

605
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:57,140
He's assembling some sort of animate 
figuring doll.

606
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,153
He just showed up with a bag full of 
toys and just wordlessly silently just 

607
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:02,660
started.
We're going to auction off when I'm done

608
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,550
building these,
someone's going to win it.

609
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,743
It's like this creepy little school girl
and I'm trying secret notes inside each 

610
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:10,010
piece.
Um,

611
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,300

00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:47,370
I did donate 1000 cause my mom wanted a 
drawing from you.

622
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,210
Okay,

624

I got whatever you want.
I've got to draw something good.

625
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,030
Anything,
something,

626
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,310
something not yelling as valid hook 
here.

627
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,361
Here.
Yeah.

628
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:00,930
Why don't you join us on the couch and 
then when the first you can just join us

629
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:01,764
here.
Do we have,

630
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,980
do we have like the,
like they,

631
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,550
they,
they've specifically requested like,

632
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,200
yes,
a thing to be.

633
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,520
All right,
hang on.

634
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,580
What's it going to be?
It's going to be hard to beat.

635
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,200
Last year in June,
we right on Joey,

636
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,034
Bernie Sanders Fan boy subscribe to 
Cutie Pie and unsubscribed from Jesus 

637
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,461
Christ.
So where,

638
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:24,330
where,
where are we?

639
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,173
I subscribe to see series.
I just want to acknowledge was 

640
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,150
subscribed to a PD pie unsubscribed to 
two series,

641
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:33,190
but since the other one was subscribed 
to Pewdie Pie,

642
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:33,781
I figured,
you know,

643
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:35,130
we could,
we could break that up a little bit.

644
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:35,760
Thanks.
We're done.

645
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,680
It's a little redundant and the names,
give them a shout out if you would.

646
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,830
There's not much,
what do you want to know?

647
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,300
Whatever.
Where could we do it?

648
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,140
Just go ahead wherever you got space.
Not a lot of room.

649
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,500
Yeah,
let's start with the neck was out there.

650
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,930
Yeah,
just like on,

651
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,860
so just try to start,
you know,

652
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,570
riding on top of writing as we continue 
through the,

653
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,530
just get in there.

654
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,920
So you've got first Bernie Sanders fan 
boy is that true jelly.

655
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,090
They see my twitter somehow I suspected 
that wasn't true.

656
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,753
Um,
subscribe to Pud Pi's next and 

657
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,990
unsubscribed from t series is 
interesting.

658
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:17,460
Joey's skin is,
is,

659
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:22,461
is not accepting the really Joey Joey,
you have unusually soft hands.

660
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:26,030
Do you know that?
Every no law.

661
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,380
Okay.
Well does that make your hands soft?

662
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:31,320
I masturbate a lot to the lotion.
I got good lotion.

663
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:32,580
Yeah.
Seriously.

664
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,680
Because every time I've shipped I'm 
shook your hand show you,

665
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,580
I've noticed you have a remarkably soft 
skin.

666
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:39,414
Whenever you talk about me on your 
podcast that you always bring up my 

667
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,540
socks because I thought it's just so 
bizarre.

668
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,403
It's like I don't ever shake someone's 
hand and notice that they have 

669
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:50,370
remarkably soft skin,
but you just,

670
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:55,020
how many times a day do you jerk off for
really with lotion?

671
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:57,600
Cause that's like a whole thing.
I use cocoa butter.

672
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,820
I like,
but it's all hours.

673
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:04,610
I lotion my arms sometimes before,
before.

674
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,580
Yeah.
That makes sense.

675
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,520
It makes more sense.
Yeah.

676
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,360
By the way,
the uh,

677
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,500
the donors who donated for Joey is 
Garrett runcorn,

678
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,220
buddy foster and solid shaggy.
So thanks.

679
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:15,330
Thank you guys.
Thank you.

680
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:16,860
Thank you.
We're up to 16,000

681
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,713
Shag.
Are you?

682
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,460
No about the Jalapeno

683
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,600
watering,
but I'm like,

684
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,640
my body can't like rejects it really.
Well,

685
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:32,070
if you need to take a shit we've got,
you can do it in the pool.

686
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,330
What?
Uh,

687
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,820
what else am I writing?
Uh,

688
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,413
a bribe.
You can just say unsub t series and sub 

689
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:42,040
two

690
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,700
Pewdie Pie.
All right.

691
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,393
I like how Bernie Sanders,
impunity pyre equally important in the 

692
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:49,210
imaginations of our donors.
They're like,

693
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,900
these are the two causes of our time.
This is what matters.

694
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,980
Tea Areas series.
Now while you go ahead and so grateful,

695
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:58,900
I don't know what any of that means.
I have an interest.

696
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,033
I have a human interest story.
This one really touched me about from 

697
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,340
the fires.
The dog waited outside.

698
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:07,980
They had to evacuate.
Oh No.

699
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,540
And this dog,
this dog ones mess me up,

700
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,760
man.
This dog is such a legend.

701
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,713
Somehow survived on its own in the 
middle of this fire and waited outside 

702
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:17,794
the house for a week.
This was something a dog apparently 

703
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:22,894
stood guard at a burn home four weeks 
until his own or returned CBS to Sandra 

704
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,263
Mitchell.
That was the story.

705
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,030
Look at this name of this guy now that 
he's finally,

706
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,910
and then also,
okay,

707
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,720
good,
good boy t series on me.

708
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,623
Paradise Fire.
But she had to leave her no jokes about 

709
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:46,900
her name and his brother Miguel.
Behind 85 people died in the fire.

710
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:49,210
14,000
homes were destroyed,

711
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,880
including gay lords.
Miguel,

712
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,320
come on and then a few days later,
face rescue workers spotted madison that

713
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,530
is burned out home.
The loyal,

714
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,120
hey man,
through the worst of circumstances being

715
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,170
so emotional,
the animal rescue worker left,

716
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,160
so they just bought the dog and she went
back to try and capture heads.

717
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:20,410
Survived,
founded.

718
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,820
Just sitting here waiting.
I mean,

719
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,820
that's the heart Anatolian shepherd.
It's a brain.

720
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,380
Three weeks week,
one week,

721
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,453
one week.
That's when they rolled up sweet 

722
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,673
creature.

723
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,463
God,
Gaylord was allowed to return home for 

724
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:46,861
the first time in almost a month.
How does she brought Miguel with her and

725
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,370
they didn't know if the dog was okay or 
not treat.

726
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,180
The dog came running in additional 
looking at warmed his heart.

727
00:31:57,611 --> 00:31:58,380
I need him.
He's like,

728
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,390
oh wait,
hold on.

729
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,040
That's a heartwarming story,
but I just have parts.

730
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,390
Let's,
I want to pick it apart.

731
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:06,280
Dissect that emotion.
So it's like,

732
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:10,860
how much time was she given to evacuate?
I want back.

733
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,220
Well,
it paradise.

734
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,040
The fire was so,
a lot of people parish because it was so

735
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:15,874

I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't 

736
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:18,820
wanna I don't want to do whatever answer
is most heartwarming.

737
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,490
My dogs would be like the fucking number

She can't carry that little old lady.

740
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,990
Miss gala was outside.
It was out,

741
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,670

25 k 25 k the first hot pepper.

756
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,030
You were raising a lot of money.
Yeah.

757
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,250
You don't have to,
uh,

758
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:19,190
Jalapenos nothin.
You need the,

759
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,340
uh,
the Carolina reaper if we raise 100,000.

760
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:24,530
So that's something you should feel 
really proud of.

761
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,250
I'm proud that I'm so like not looking 
forward.

762
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,920
I know we got a problem with um,
with his mic.

763
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,660
Oh,
he's Mike with Joey's.

764
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:37,130
Mike.
Sorry I haven't lean.

765
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,490
Lean up to one of your guys.
Mike,

766
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,700
if he's talking to a microphone and 
throw me in the corner.

767
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,270
Well I'll fix it in a second,
but we care one or two times.

768
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,080
You can talk into my mic here.
Can you hear me now?

769
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,683
No.

770
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,090
Yeah,
yeah.

771
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,943
You want to,
you can use mine cause I'm drawing 

772
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,140
anyway.
Yeah,

773
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:59,141
you can go ahead and meanwhile,
have you guys bring a chair meanwhile?

774
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,840
Um,
what are we up to right now?

775
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,863
We're at the total right now.
The total right now is 17 and a half 

776
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:08,510
thousand.
I mean like,

777
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,960
I know we raise a lot of money last year
and I should be like desensitized to it.

778
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:13,690
But like that's an amazing,
that's amazing.

779
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:19,710
Well and I think the donations that you 
guys gave and the prizes are,

780
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,950
they're amazing.
They're warrant.

781
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,190
So you get to give money and when,
incredible,

782
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,570
beautiful thing.
Oh Great.

783
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:28,440
We've got another one to ride on me.
Congratulation.

784
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,060
I got another one.
The writer who's the next person.

785
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,750
By the way,
we also have this,

786
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,770
there won't be any sweat this this year 
to drip it off.

787
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,340
It's,
it's cold and this year it is frosty.

788
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,360
I,
last year they started to melt but these

789
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:43,490
are going to stay for a long time now 
guys,

790
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:44,324
we have the c o of direct relief joining
us on a call later on because last year 

791
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,930
we're going to really lay,
sent us,

792
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,880

I'm not sweating,

793
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:57,610
but he will be,
um,

794
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,970
I have an email here from them where 
thatF is.

795
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:05,570
It is my question.
Oh my God.

796
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,720
I thought I had it all organized,
busting open these mystery snacks.

797
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:10,020
By the way before,
I don't know what these are.

798
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:11,960
Justin brought them.
Where did you get this stuff?

799
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,060
Um,
Japanese.

800
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,090
Uh,
why is it not here town?

801
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,270
Oh,
I'm in the wrong one.

802
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,610
It almost a quarter mill.
Last year.

803
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,480
Yeah.
Last year we raised 240 that was the dog

804
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,673
off stream we got,
so here's the letter from direct relief 

805
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:32,630
that I got from them before we went on 
this livestream here today.

806
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,463
They said,
hey guys,

807
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,350
just want to drop you a note and let you
know how grateful we are for your sport.

808
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,393

biggest online marathon and we can't 

809
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:44,100
tell you how much this means to us.
We're excited to have our CEO calling in

810

817
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:00,390
Be flossing.
No,

818
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,180
I would have been sober.
Look at your calling Kate Bay,

819
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,950
so there you go.
Dylan.

820
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:05,784
Good when and great prizes.
It's all happening now as we inch 

821
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:11,790
forward to this first milestone,
we had 18,000

822
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:15,180
guys.
Let's enjoy a holiday video together.

823
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,130
What I want to can real quick before you
do that to me.

824
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:23,210
We have a $500 donation from spoon and 
he would like to just put the label papa

825
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:27,830
on your forehead.
Uh,

826
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,580
now that you're going to be a dad.
All right.

827
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,910
Sweet.
It's not even like trollie or mean.

828
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,390
That's so much more respectable than I 
love come last year they'll trickle it.

829
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,120
Oh my God,
this is really good.

830
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,940
Yeah.
It's some kind of like a,

831
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,170
was that a cherry flavor like crunchy 
but gets blue raspberry.

832
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,230
It's gets kind of like you want to try 
that fan on.

833
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,660
Does it have carbs the best?
Uh,

834
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,050
while you were about,
I mean,

835
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,450
you're going to shit everything out 
anyway.

836
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,343
That's true.
Like I wouldn't worry too much about 

837
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:07,941
what you eat in a way.
A $500 donation from Cameron booster and

838
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:13,770
they didn't actually leave anything to 
write.

839
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:17,910
They just wanted to shout out to his 
girlfriend Chris Mcmurry and her beloved

840
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:18,744
cat,

841
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:23,640
tight Tenneco's titanic.
Titanic.

842
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,070
No,
Alex.

843
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,910
Oh wait a minute.
And they hold on.

844
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,520
I'm dropping the lincoln discord.
If you could throw this up on the screen

845
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:35,220
real quick on my book because this is a 
beautiful cut.

846
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,533
Oh,
just what they want us to show the 

847
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:38,490
patents.
Show that titanic.

848
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,940
Show that kit.
Whoa.

849
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:43,700
Look at that cat.
Yeah.

850
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,140
That's a cool cat.
Is that photoshop?

851
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,140
This looks so beautiful.
What do you think that natural radio,

852
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,500
gorgeous cat's looking at in that 
picture.

853
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:55,080
What do you think it's thinking about 
man,

854
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,390
that's a,
that's thinking about America's future.

855
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,493
Yeah.
It's like where are we headed for 

856
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,413
president know?
He's replacing Tucker Carlson the 

857
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:05,030
planet.
Thank you.

858
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:05,963
Got Cameron.
Boaster beautiful cat and shout out to 

859
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:10,260
your girlfriend Chris.
Guys,

860
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,080
we're inching closer to this.
We're at 19,000

861
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:13,681
joey.
Good.

862
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:16,410
Pucker up your asshole because we are 
about to get on a wild wild ride.

863
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,270
Now let's watch a Christmas video that I
saw on youtube today.

864
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,850
That is one of the greatest things I've 
ever seen.

865
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,580
You guys know this thing's going 
absolutely viral.

866
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:29,550
Five 15 million.
It was supposed to only a couple of days

867
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,530
ago.
This is mark rope rubber.

868
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,940
This is,
you're going to love this.

869
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,530
[inaudible] can tell them.
You've seen this,

870
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:36,430
Alex.
I've seen it.

871
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,800
I haven't seen this.
So as you guys know,

872
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,693
box theft is a huge problem today.
People going up to your head and 

873
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,663
especially around the holiday,
they go up to your door and they steal 

874
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:47,494
your package.
So this guy was tired of this happening 

875
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,273
and what he devised was a bomb,
a glitter bomb to go off with a camera 

876
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,670
in the box so he could record there.
We had the wrong people get called.

877
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,530
Now this is going to cut it.
Now this guy,

878
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,730
this guy is a,
was as a former NASA engineer.

879
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,600
Yeah.
Like being sent to Mars.

880
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,760
It's half with the wrong guy.

881
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,541
Exactly.
Yeah,

882
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:13,520
yeah,
exactly right.

883
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,890
Having fun making glitter bomb packages.
So great.

884
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:22,760
He does this a bunch of times and he 
captures just unbelievable footage.

885
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:23,594
So let's,
all right,

886
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,210
I may be biased,
but sometimes in your design,

887
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,103
and it doesn't just throw it up,
literally four cameras capturing live 

888
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,060
and it also has,
um,

889
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,790
barb on,
but as a fart bomb also the fart bomb is

890
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:36,960
just incredible.
First,

891
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:39,300
the glitter shoots out.
This has been really hard bump shoots at

892
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:40,134
like every 30 seconds.
So they have to get rid of it when they 

893
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:43,164
realized,
because at first they're going to be 

894
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:44,311
like,
Hey,

895
00:39:44,311 --> 00:39:45,870
what is this?
And then it keeps going.

896
00:39:45,871 --> 00:39:48,090
So amazing.
So the,

897
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,600
and then the best thing about this is 
that I expose,

898
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,220
this guy's got to mass produce these and
sell them.

899
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,093
Yeah,
it was about to say I would buy it the 

900
00:39:55,561 --> 00:40:00,090
most fine grained glitter in the world.
Impossible to get out of carpet.

901
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,150
[inaudible] package has been moved off 
the property.

902
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,850
So I put it out on the porch and now all
that was left to do

903
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,440
what's his weight and he could have done
a better wrapping job.

904
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,983
Okay.
So I was at work and I got a 

905
00:40:09,861 --> 00:40:12,770
notification that the geo fence we set 
up had been tripped.

906
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,710
So then I checked the cameras and sure 
enough the package has gone.

907
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,573
So I checked the GPS and sort of tracked
it and it appears they're in a car 

908
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:22,880
because they seem to leave my house 
pretty quickly off.

909
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,020
It seems to stop in a parking garage,
which is where I'm headed to now.

910
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,300
And if you're new here,
this isn't a prank channels.

911
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,580
So I am completely out of my comfort 
zone.

912
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:36,200
Rubber by the way,
this legend and there she is.

913
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,590
Oh,
oh,

914
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,331
oh.
So,

915
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:46,560
so,
so we're covering,

916
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,380
it would still work even if I didn't get
the box back,

917
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:54,290
the footage would upload to the cloud,
but it's just faster to plug the phones.

918
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,440
I'm gonna go home and find out what he 
thought of everything,

919
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,633
how I ended up here.
So it appears he was walking down the 

920
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:03,380
sidewalk and then suddenly makes a hard 
left.

921
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,850
They take these clothing,
actually makes it to this parking garage

922
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,400
where this glorious sequence unfold.

923
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,460
Um,
like four cameras.

924
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:16,663
Oh,

925
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:19,883
okay.

926
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:31,510
Look

927
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,110
at that.
They're looking at my car,

928
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,973
dude.

929
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,940
Everything.
Oh my God.

930
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,710
I don't know what this is.
Literally like everywhere.

931
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,590
My friend CC is also had some packages 
stolen.

932
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:48,080
So you make her a few days.
He didn't.

933
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,750
Oh Dude.
That's what I'm saying.

934
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:52,010
I would,
I would buy,

935
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:56,780
I would spend more than what a home pod 
costs or whatever want to do whatever,

936
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,460
whatever it is,
the actual item.

937
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:04,470
This is more of this needs to happen 
like this is too good.

938
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,573
I saw another video of a guy who cashed 
it and Piss in a box and now the best 

939
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:18,600
part of the FARC coming.
Wait for that.

940
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,750
I like that he's upset.
Like,

941
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:23,280
come on.
How could you play me like that?

942
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,470
I don't deserve this at all.
Life is fair,

943
00:42:28,471 --> 00:42:30,390
dude.
You never going to get that stuff out of

944
00:42:30,391 --> 00:42:31,800
your car.
Oh yeah,

945
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:32,910
that'll,
that'll be there for,

946
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:33,803
that's the FARC spray and his car with 
the windows up genius down to the Fart 

947
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:47,340
spray.
Oh,

948
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,050
it's a beautiful thing.
Oh,

949
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:54,051
this is,
I listed,

950
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:06,450
they go piss like someone did something 
awful to them.

951
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,640
I also like that they're narrating to no
one.

952
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,560
They're so pissed off that they have and
be like,

953
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,520
this is too good.
This is too good.

954
00:43:14,521 --> 00:43:16,470
It is.
People are assholes.

955
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,880
They're like stealing shit and then the 
camera didn't work.

956
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:25,881
He said,
I lifted.

957
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,860
It keeps going every 30 seconds.
It just doing it.

958
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,980
You probably spend a lot of money,
but he grabbed that.

959
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,350
At least these are having a good time.
They're like cracking up of the Jelly,

960
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,380
a draw.
Lee Burglars Him saying,

961
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,400
you shouldn't have even taken that.
It's like,

962
00:43:59,401 --> 00:44:00,234
yeah,
that's the moral of this episode of 

963
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,000
legends of the crypt keeper or whatever 
like that.

964
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,820
Man,
these people are so brazen.

965
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,073
I love about inside.
He's just like stunned trying to figure 

966
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,070
out what to do with this

967
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,600
on Myers.
Did her launch mechanism.

968
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:46,080
Just don't take other people's stuff.
Not only is it not cool,

969
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,033
but on the plus side you'll never find 
yourself in this situation or perhaps 

970
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:52,520
even worse.
This one will get in here.

971
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:52,840
Then

972
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,100
who you had in there,
you have it.

973
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:01,030
One of the best videos ever made just in
time for the holidays.

974
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:01,871
Why?
Once again,

975
00:45:01,871 --> 00:45:05,350
Mark Rober,
God bless his soul guys,

976
00:45:05,351 --> 00:45:07,860
we are up to $20,000
Oh,

977
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,560
when's the first pepper chowning five 
hours were 5,000

978
00:45:11,561 --> 00:45:15,580
away from this Chi eating on.
What kind of a power on the first one is

979
00:45:15,581 --> 00:45:20,560
a raw jalapenos and is it?
Is he eating the whole thing?

980
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:23,140
Whole thing.
Can I just take a bite?

981
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,650
It's a Jalapeno Joe.
Give it,

982
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,870
cause I don't want to drop dead because 
if you think about it,

983
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:33,700
well what if my don't get people never 
do like eight the entire pepper.

984
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,440
What I'm saying is like people eat the 
ghost pepper and that's that.

985
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,720
They go,
you don't have,

986
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,470
you don't have to eat the reaper and 
then that shit,

987
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,660
but I got,
oh,

988
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,950
okay.
You don't have to eat the whole of those

989
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:43,810
do does he?

990
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,450
Maybe you're the challenge.
All the spices are going to be trying to

991
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:50,800
weasel his way out.
Well,

992
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,720
we're talking about the Jalapeno.
You,

993
00:45:52,721 --> 00:45:57,721
you owe us here 25 or let's say when we 
do Jalapeno,

994
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,540
that's not,
that's the entry level.

995
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,060
I mean,
I'm just listening about ahead of time.

996
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,980
Let's set the rose.
Okay.

997
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,270
And era.
Our whole a whole,

998
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,570
he's got hold of the whole gang,
a whole hub in Europe.

999
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,280
I then you can go half on the two.
Oh No,

1000
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:16,511
no,
no.

1001
00:46:16,511 --> 00:46:18,610
It's got to eat the whole thing.
Justin says you got to go.

1002
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:19,893
This is why the money's coming in.
Just those saying he felt bad about 

1003
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:23,800
swearing you last year and now he's 
like,

1004
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
[inaudible] I have to abide by what?
The audience,

1005
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,790
your expiry.
I'll do it.

1006
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,830
I'll do whatever.
Donating this money.

1007
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:37,570
Also,
the donations are slowing down.

1008
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:38,404
I mean we're at thousand 300.
They nail it because they heard these 

1009
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:41,561
knocking.
It's like,

1010
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:42,490
what a,
wait a minute.

1011
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,460
This is affecting the stock.
The warning label says,

1012
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,280
um,
handle with gloves.

1013
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,900
You can't even touch the thing.
It goes in your mouth,

1014
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,273
not on your hand.

1015
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:54,961
All right.
Hey,

1016
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:57,060
I've got a couple more messages that we 
got to right.

1017
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:57,923
Oh,
excellent.

1018
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,741
Excellent.
Excellent.

1019
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:00,330
What are the hot,
so I've got,

1020
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,580
uh,
two more for Joey.

1021
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,760
A sub to Ryan McCarty.
Um,

1022
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,010
Yup.
So why don't you join us on pouty?

1023
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,230
Joey can do the writing.
Yeah,

1024
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,800
sure.
Keep going.

1025
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,310
So it's up to Ryan McCarty.
I'll put it,

1026
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,950
I'll put it in discord so you see how 
it's spelled and buy Bitcoin,

1027
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:24,951
both of those on Joey.
And then I have some for Ethan to,

1028
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,270
uh,
we have,

1029
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,010
uh,
we just want a james wine Hoff

1030
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,330
wants you to write Jacob's sausage on a,
on somewhere.

1031
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,840
And then Simon is asking you to write 
hightail,

1032
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:40,763
which,
uh,

1033
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,793
is the name of his video game and he's 
going to use a screen cap from the 

1034
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:46,770
screen in his trailer.
Okay.

1035
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,950
The,
okay.

1036
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:48,953
All right.
Go ahead.

1037
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,220
That's a,
that's a good capitalism.

1038
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:54,220
Exactly.
Advertising honestly,

1039
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,520
I mean 500 bucks for,
yeah.

1040
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:59,890
What we could do,
by the way,

1041
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:03,250
is once we could do a thing where once 
real estate has completely taken,

1042
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,890
we clear some room cause it's like,
you know,

1043
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:06,491
the,
the,

1044
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:07,750
the uh,
the footage of you,

1045
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,350
the phase.
That's true.

1046
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:12,430
You know,
I don't want to,

1047
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,610
I don't want to play a realistic,
the point where there's literally no,

1048
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,680
well,
so far I think it'll be a while.

1049
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:18,760
And so far these guys,
I mean,

1050
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:20,200
we're at 21,000.
I mean,

1051
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:21,370
am I right?
We're getting close.

1052
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,570
Oh,
what are you writing on my face?

1053
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,250
I just dropped it in discord for me.
Oh Wow.

1054
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:28,810
Here you go.
Oh,

1055
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:30,350
it's in discord.
So what,

1056
00:48:30,351 --> 00:48:31,480
why are you doing that,
Alex?

1057
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:35,290
You've got a big part of the Netflix,
Netflix family now.

1058
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,910
Oh yes,
that's right.

1059
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,590
Yeah.
Um,

1060
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:43,120
uh,
the streaming algorithm program company.

1061
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:45,250
Netflix giant.
I worked for them now.

1062
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,080
So tell me,
what does that mean that because you,

1063
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,350
they,
they like bought your whole,

1064
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,820
they bought my life,
right?

1065
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:55,930
They tattooed the end lower back,
the equivalent of what Justin's doing to

1066
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:57,520
me now.
They did essentially.

1067
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:58,210
Yeah.
Also,

1068
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,580
I was working on this,
uh,

1069
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,740
I was working on the secret movie that I
guess I'm not allowed to talk about,

1070
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,593
you know,
I can't even say,

1071
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,340
I can't even say what it is.
It's,

1072
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:07,270
it was big.
It was,

1073
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,290
it was a thing.
Um,

1074
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,070
but uh,
it wasn't creatively.

1075
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:12,963
And a Netflix made me a really amazing 
offer to basically make anything in the 

1076
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,154
world I want,
which is kind of an intimidating thing 

1077
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,800
if just like,
you know,

1078
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:24,010
like a company just like plops down a 
bag of money on your chest and it's just

1079
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:25,840
like whatever you want to make,
make it.

1080
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,003
Um,
almost you're saying it's almost too 

1081
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:29,860
much freedom.
It's awesome.

1082
00:49:29,861 --> 00:49:30,694
But it is like,
it is one of those things where you're 

1083
00:49:31,841 --> 00:49:32,171
like,
wait,

1084
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:35,410
so like what are the rules here?
And other sensors,

1085
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:36,244
you know,
like I came from the Disney channel or 

1086
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,740
was like,
everything was censored,

1087
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:39,580
you know,
and it's like,

1088
00:49:39,581 --> 00:49:40,090
it's like,
no,

1089
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:40,841
like whatever you want,
man.

1090
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:41,920
I'm make a movie.
You want to make a show?

1091
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:42,970
What do you,
what do you,

1092
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,990
so I'm working on a new top secret,
untitled Alex Hirsch project.

1093
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,830
Cool.
Um,

1094
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,320
that I'm very nice.
Did a cartoon is a live action.

1095
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,910
Can you say anything?
Uh,

1096
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:52,721
I,
I,

1097
00:49:52,721 --> 00:49:54,940
they probably would be fine with it,
but I want to keep it a secret.

1098
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:57,500
You want to keep it a secret?
Secretive?

1099
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:58,900
Yeah,
just always been secretive.

1100
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,610
You've back of the Disney days,
man.

1101
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:01,444
I remember on fish hooks you were like 
hiding in your office and I'd knock on 

1102
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:06,480
the door and you'd open it a crack and 
he got it.

1103
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:07,743
And I'd be like,
Hey,

1104
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,160
can I come in?
I want to talk.

1105
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:10,120
And then you'd be like,
hold on,

1106
00:50:10,121 --> 00:50:12,700
close the door,
turn every single screen.

1107
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,060
Worked forward around every,
like all this shit.

1108
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,350
I'm like,
all right.

1109
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:19,940
Uh,
that's like God damn it.

1110
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,810
Probably because like I was fan of 
justice before I met him,

1111
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,640
so I was like intimidated and I was 
like,

1112
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:25,474
oh,
this guy's going to see my stupid 

1113
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:26,674
cartoon idea.
Like that's when I was coming up with 

1114
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:28,394
gravity falls at the time I was like,
I don't want him to see my stupid 

1115
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:30,524
drawings,
but I have a hard time throwing when 

1116
00:50:32,481 --> 00:50:34,100
people are like looking over my 
shoulder,

1117
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,450
you know what I mean?
At the same time,

1118
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,240
like I have a hard time writing when 
there's like lots of people around,

1119
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,850
like I can't write and like a coffee 
shop for some reason.

1120
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,580
Like I need to like lock the door,
dim the lights,

1121
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:45,020
and then,
then the demons enter,

1122
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,750
you know what I mean?
But I'm working on something really cool

1123
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:50,030
for Netflix right now,
but I can't say it to this.

1124
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:52,100
How much this body and what's the 
timeline?

1125
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:53,900
How much time do you,
or is it just totally,

1126
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,690
do they put a timeline on yours?
It just like whenever,

1127
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:57,710
whatever.
Yeah.

1128
00:50:57,711 --> 00:50:58,550
Yeah.
Um,

1129
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,473
it's,
uh,

1130
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,050
around,
around a year from now,

1131
00:51:03,051 --> 00:51:05,460
there's going to be a lot to talk about.
Um,

1132
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,201
like,
uh,

1133
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:08,130
I'm also producing some things.
Uh,

1134
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:09,103
there's,
Netflix is like making a big bid for 

1135
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:12,380
animation.
They just like notice like,

1136
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:13,214
okay,
Disney bought Fox and so now they have 

1137
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:17,210
like simpsons and family guy and Netflix
is like,

1138
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,230
okay,
all right,

1139
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,660
let's go all in,
let's,

1140
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,553
let's make a bunch of Rad shows.
We need the next generation of 

1141
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:24,540
animation.

1142
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,270
Um,
and it's like happening right now.

1143
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:28,070
It's very cool to be a part of it.
Like,

1144
00:51:28,071 --> 00:51:31,370
it feels weird because I'm used to just 
bitching about my parent company.

1145
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,693
Right?
It's like I was always like whining 

1146
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:34,760
about Disney and like,
they were great to me,

1147
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,080
you know what I mean?
But like,

1148
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:40,070
I was just so constantly aware of all 
the rules and things I can't do,

1149
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,050
you know,
on the Netflix is just like,

1150
00:51:42,051 --> 00:51:44,310
yeah,
whatever crazy thing you could think of.

1151
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,310
You want to make a movie,
you want to make a mini series,

1152
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,890
you want to mix up shot holes,
bro.

1153
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:52,190
So get ready for the Butthole Bros 
starring me and Justin reuland.

1154
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,024
Obviously I'm pop a butthole.
He's a jimmy bottled juice and we are 

1155
00:51:57,021 --> 00:52:02,021
two brothers who have big gaping 
buttholes right in our faces gimmick.

1156
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:05,570
And it's why the ladies love us coming 
to Netflix.

1157
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Uh,
so for that I would watch that.

1158
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:12,650
Don't,
don't give him,

1159
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:15,140
don't give him too many ideas.
Don't give away the good one.

1160
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:15,974
And Justin,
what secrets can you tell us about all 

1161
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,180
the things happening in the Justin verse
right now?

1162
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,680
Alex through that oval on over to Justin
mass fine.

1163
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,490
Oh no,
go ahead.

1164
00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:24,324
I mean I'm like,
Oh yeah,

1165
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,120
I can't do that.
No,

1166
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:27,740
I get,
I get that you are,

1167
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:29,090
I'm just,
I'm fat.

1168
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:29,990
I'm fat.
No,

1169
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,080
let's go over to judge.
I mean like keep,

1170
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,400
keep like I can't talk about it.
That's why I was just ignored it.

1171
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,660
I just wanted to hear more about how do 
you,

1172
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,580
cause you said you haven't like no 
rules,

1173
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,190
you can do anything.
It was still hard to you.

1174
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,450
You have to come up with something,
right?

1175
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,303
Sure.
Yeah.

1176
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,091
Well,
I like my,

1177
00:52:47,091 --> 00:52:47,924
I don't know,
everyone has like a different creative 

1178
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:49,310
process I guess.

1179
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:50,143
Like for me I kind of do like my own 
like mental hunger games where like I'm 

1180
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:55,310
constantly coming up with like different
variations.

1181
00:52:55,311 --> 00:52:58,190
Like when I came up with gravity falls,
I actually came up with three TV shows.

1182
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,293
Um,
and I pitched like three shows to 

1183
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:01,520
Disney.
I'm like,

1184
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,730
one was about time traveling dolphins,
the other two were terrible.

1185
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:06,500
Um,
it literally was,

1186
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:07,334
I'm not making that up.
That was going to be my other show if 

1187
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:11,540
they had picked that up.
But so like I just like,

1188
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:12,463
like fill a sketchbook with like lots 
and lots of characters and situations 

1189
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:16,424
and stuff.
And then I like kind of compete them 

1190
00:53:17,301 --> 00:53:18,860
against each other.
In my mind I'm like,

1191
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:21,500
which one is delighting me more today?
You know what I mean?

1192
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:22,334
And then like make a little like power 
bracket of my own ideas for myself and 

1193
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,730
then like show like maybe a few people 
like,

1194
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:27,690
what do you think,
what do you think?

1195
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:28,440
And then I'm like,
all right,

1196
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,273
all right,
this is the thing I want to spend a 

1197
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,220
bunch of years on.
So is that what kind of what you've been

1198
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:32,731
doing?
Yeah,

1199
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:33,564
that's what I've been doing and I've 
like finally narrowed it down to some 

1200
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:37,700
really exciting stuff.
Wow.

1201
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:41,040
I'm like stoked on and come up with your
arm timeline.

1202
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,480
Like deadlines or do you have deadlines?
It's,

1203
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,880
I mean it's all,
it's kind of like,

1204
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:48,840
it's like sort of the wild west over 
there right now because it's brand new,

1205
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:50,940
you know what I mean?
But they're like very supportive.

1206
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:51,774
Like they have,
they have deadlines and they have like 

1207
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,050
their producers structure.
But within that,

1208
00:53:55,051 --> 00:53:56,010
like the very,
all the cart,

1209
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:58,590
like you can be like,
hey this is a different kind of thing.

1210
00:53:58,591 --> 00:53:59,424
I want to try something else and maybe 
we put more time here and they're so 

1211
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:04,044
open to it.

1212
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,033
Like it's also like there's no 
commercials so you can make episodes 

1213
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:08,500
like longer.
Super interesting.

1214
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,380
Do you don't have to think like I was so
used to like,

1215
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:11,850
oh,
if it's two seconds over,

1216
00:54:11,851 --> 00:54:13,980
Disney is like,
you've got to find those two seconds.

1217
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:15,270
And here it's like,
whoa.

1218
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,163
You're like,
you don't have to worry about act 

1219
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:17,730
breaks.
Yeah.

1220
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,010
It's a,
it's a different world man.

1221
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:21,180
Um,
but it's really,

1222
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:24,060
and the executives they are,
do they give you notes?

1223
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:26,340
Cause probably Disney's all up your ass 
with notes.

1224
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:27,203
Yeah.
Um,

1225
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,810
the executives basically are just like a
first audience so far.

1226
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,730
Um,
like they're really cool.

1227
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:34,440
They just want to see something that's 
funny.

1228
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,303
And like,
I think the traditional development 

1229
00:54:36,991 --> 00:54:37,824
model and television is network spend a 
crap load of money developing like one 

1230
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:45,180
or two projects that they like put all 
their hopes in and they promote the shit

1231
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,980
out of him and then if they're not 
immediately hits the,

1232
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:47,814
cancel them.

1233
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,990
Right.
Um,

1234
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,370
and it's like,
that's not good for anybody.

1235
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,233
That's like putting way too much 
pressure on every single project where 

1236
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:54,990
it's like the new kind of streaming 
pipeline.

1237
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:55,824
Like the way Netflix does it is like 
we're just going to empower a bunch of 

1238
00:54:58,081 --> 00:54:58,914
creators who we think have something 
cool and we're going to make smaller 

1239
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:04,050
seasons and put them all out there.
And if people watch it,

1240
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,970
you get more episodes.
And if people don't,

1241
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,500
we're not picking up for a second 
season,

1242
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:09,120
but those episodes aren't going 
anywhere,

1243
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,350
you know,
like,

1244
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,730
so it's like,
it's almost like,

1245
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,920
like,
like low risk,

1246
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:15,840
high reward,
you know what I mean?

1247
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,790
Um,
and it like content.

1248
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,490
Yes.
And they want it on demand.

1249
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,650
Lots of content and lots of ideas.
I'm just kidding.

1250
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:24,420
It's a little scary.
There's like so much shit.

1251
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,710
There's so much shit on streaming.

1252
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,860
It's weird to be making tv in an era 
where there's never been more television

1253
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:31,290
in history and you're like,
how are people going to notice?

1254
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:34,080
But I feel like good stuff is still 
recognized.

1255
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,840
You know what I mean?
Like definitely there's so much junk out

1256
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:38,550
there with it when like something really
hits or something,

1257
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,170
it's not at all.
Like,

1258
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,960
I remember that there was that show,
high profits,

1259
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,100
that show was so fucking good.
Well,

1260
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,220
I've never even heard of it.
No one's heard about it.

1261
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,300
The critters profit.
It's a,

1262
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:52,060
it's a reality show or it's like more of
a documentary.

1263
00:55:52,061 --> 00:55:54,960
It's done like documentary series.
So it's not like cheap,

1264
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,853
it's not like a cheap reality show.
It's like a well produced documentary 

1265
00:55:59,071 --> 00:56:04,071
series about this couple that opened up.
Um,

1266
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:05,363
you know,
we'd store on the main strip and 

1267
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:08,430
Colorado in this town in Colorado.

1268
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,640
This is like ski town and it's just 
fascinating man.

1269
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:13,080
It's like,
so all the picking it up,

1270
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:14,910
I'm greenlighting it.
It's on Netflix.

1271
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,160
Oh wait.
But it was bringing it back,

1272
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:19,200
but it was originally on like,
like CNN,

1273
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,410
CNBC or msnbc or one of these other 
channels.

1274
00:56:22,411 --> 00:56:26,160
Sort of these deep cut channels.
And in their first wave of,

1275
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,520
hey,
we're going to make original stuff,

1276
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:30,220
but nobody only,
no,

1277
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,110
everyone only knows us for our news 
content.

1278
00:56:32,111 --> 00:56:33,100
You know what I mean?
So,

1279
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:34,600
so it just,
it just slipped through the cracks.

1280
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:36,190
But I watched it on Netflix and I was 
like,

1281
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,473
I would kill for a second season.
I wanna I wanna I wanna I want to see 

1282
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:40,684
where these characters and maybe the 
justice people are going to get it 

1283
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:44,590
picked up.
Maybe you talking about tweeted about it

1284
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:49,180
a long time ago and nobody cares 
exclusively for like my own,

1285
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:54,181
like if you find a toy that is slightly 
broken Uri and I need to,

1286
00:56:54,701 --> 00:56:56,020
I,
well the problem is I got,

1287
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:57,400
I started getting scared of twitter.

1288
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,233
It was like,
I don't want to tweet any like original 

1289
00:56:59,531 --> 00:57:02,680
thoughts because God only knows where 
that could lead.

1290
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:03,514
So it's just like 20 year old like 
personal yelp for like everything you 

1291
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,553
buy by default.
That's kind of what's happened 

1292
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,990
unfortunately.
But yeah,

1293
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,390
yeah.
God forbid thoughts.

1294
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,080
Yeah.
It's like going to look man,

1295
00:57:14,081 --> 00:57:15,550
we gotta be careful on twitter.
You know,

1296
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:18,220
it's like,
but the other cool thing about Netflix,

1297
00:57:18,221 --> 00:57:19,054
cause you were just talking about like 
that's such a common thing is if 

1298
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:22,690
somebody makes a great show for the 
wrong channel and it shot,

1299
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,340
that happens all the time.
I mean that happened.

1300
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,760
Got Two more,
uh,

1301
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,330
oo much here.
By the way.

1302
00:57:28,331 --> 00:57:30,280
We are up to 23,000.
We have,

1303
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:33,830
we got more shit to write asking.
You've got to,

1304
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:38,850
which is a Jew word for a Jewish word 
for Munchie stuff podcast.

1305
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,640
Schmutz oh yeah,
there's trip hightail.

1306
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,060
Jacob's sausage.
And then uh,

1307
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:52,750
let those some muddy as long name.
What you wrote that you on the podcast.

1308
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,060
I wrote those already.
So did you do the furry one?

1309
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:55,913
No,
no you did the high tail on the Jacobs 

1310
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:59,080
sausage aren't perfect.
Those are take a look.

1311
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,970
Take a look right there.
Hold up,

1312
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,833

He needs this for his marketing did 

1313
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,900
well.
It's like literally like on is on,

1314
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:06,460
is on a part of his face.

1315
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,310
Kind of look to your left I tail.
All right,

1316
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,050
there you go buddy.
That's fine.

1317
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,610
If you ever spent,
um,

1318
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,200
so we should just choose the longest 
word they can possibly think of for your

1319
00:58:20,201 --> 00:58:21,034
face.
And entertainment wants to work for 

1320
00:58:22,841 --> 00:58:23,730
Netflix now.
Justin,

1321
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:28,360

Netflix or you have to be really cool to

1322
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:29,194
work for Netflix?
Just based off of everyone I've talked 

1323
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:33,460

Like you could show like,

1324
00:58:33,461 --> 00:58:36,820
like the wrinkles on a,
on a butthole and everything's okay.

1325
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,360
No,

Uh,

1327

00:58:40,571 --> 00:58:41,640
butthole brothers.
Yeah.

let's raffle it a,
yeah,

1349
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:33,980
the rafts.
Raffling all right,

1350
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:35,470
we'll rappel.
Kick.

1351
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:36,790
Can we ask,
is there like a,

1352
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,633
I'm assuming there's some kind of like 
live chat happening right now or 

1353
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:40,940
something or no,
there's no chapter though.

1354
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,890
It must be just on like twitter or 
something.

1355
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,653
I just want it like if there's any way I
could get a request for like what to 

1356
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:48,000
draw or write.
Oh,

1357
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,630
cause like,
yeah.

1358
00:59:50,631 --> 00:59:51,950
Why don't we do a poll,
by the way,

1359
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:54,200
I want to do a poll.
You guys can give options.

1360
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:59,230
You got to donate and donating.
You get to participate in the polls now.

1361
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,950
I would,
I would be willing to for a thousand,

1362
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:09,130
I wouldn't be willing for $1,000
donation to tell Lynn what?

1363
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,310
Oh,
to lick a pepper.

1364
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,970
I would be willing if somebody donates 
$1,000

1365
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,860
to touch it to my tired.
Scared at one.

1366
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,090
No,
you don't have to use that one.

1367
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:25,710
But Joe had trusts me.
A drop of my saliva is a law.

1368
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:26,750
You pee.
You want that one?

1369
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,500
Are you doing,
I don't mind.

1370
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,480
For a guy that's stuck his dick in a hot
dog bun.

1371
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:33,380
You really,
uh,

1372
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,050
overly overly guarded about cooties.
That being said,

1373
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,910
we are getting so close.
So guys,

1374
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,620
Post Malone,
Smash Guitar,

1375
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:46,110
Rick and Morty original.
All right.

1376
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:50,270
Stop with the donation.
We've got the limited edition journal.

1377
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:53,710
That thing's worth by my estimation.
At least a hundred thousand dollars.

1378
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,980
Get the in there.
Eva Klein original art.

1379
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,480
Get in there and drop somebody.

1380
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:07,340
Thank you.
Can we do the furry thing?

1381
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,780
Oh,
shredding the first thing.

1382
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:13,290
You got it right.
It's um,

1383
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:15,770
look at this fucking suck about 
sweethearts.

1384
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,880
Busy here.
Training.

1385
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:20,323
What's it got to say?
Is he over here trying to say you want 

1386
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:22,700
to do it?
I'll do it.

1387
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,560
I'll do it.
It's um,

1388
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,350
it's something about a furry,
uh,

1389
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:30,590
it's written here as um,
as Amea Kinda.

1390
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:31,220
Wow.
Whoa.

1391
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,090
Geez.
Good.

1392
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,200
You said you could write it on their 
neck.

1393
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,290
Justin,
rick and morty.

1394
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:42,530
Huge Rick and morty news.
The show was renewed big time.

1395
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,300
Yeah.

1396

So we got,

1397
01:01:45,621 --> 01:01:50,040
we got a big hefty order for more 
episode.

1398
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:53,270
Tell me about how big was the order?
Um,

1399
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,050
it was like another six seasons.
It's,

1400
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,160

01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:04,640
I mean,
well,

1405
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,980
the jury's out on that one.
I mean,

1406
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:09,050
hopefully not,
hopefully not,

1407
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:09,920
uh,
you know,

1408
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:15,280

Now you guys are currently in production

1409
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,180
of the new season,
right?

1410
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,040
Yeah.
And how's that going?

1411
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,100
It's great.
It's

1412
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,060
going good.
We've got,

1413
01:02:21,061 --> 01:02:22,270

1417
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:28,734

1418
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:29,431
I mean we're,

1421
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:37,680
shipped for color animation.
But yeah,

1422
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:38,940
like this is so long.
We're,

1423
01:02:38,941 --> 01:02:39,630

1424
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,060

1425
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:42,930

1426
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,830
That's great.
Yeah.

1427
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,753
I,
everyone's super going to be cool and 

1428
01:02:45,451 --> 01:02:46,150
spoilers,
boilers for us.

1429
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,370
Jay,
real quick.

1430
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,630
Some exciting news.
Yeah.

1431
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,870
Oh,
can we hit the first milestone?

1432
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,393
Well.
Just not want to pick up this 

1433
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:02,570
conversation and we'll hold on that.
Alison.

1434
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:03,603
Guys,
we think

1435
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:06,590
you so much.
This is milestone number one.

1436
01:03:06,591 --> 01:03:08,690
Keep it coming though.
For Christ's sake.

1437
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:13,250
You guys that the value of these gifts 
far to pass 25,000

1438
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:14,450
that's right.
That's right.

1439
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,160
We're taking a loss here,
Joey.

1440
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,500
Let's all go.
Let's get your ass in the Kiddie Pool.

1441
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:18,801
Wait,
wait,

1442
01:03:18,801 --> 01:03:19,590
wait,
wait.

1443
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:20,810
Yeah.
I don't think I should get in the Kiddie

1444
01:03:20,811 --> 01:03:21,710
pool,
but this one,

1445
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,753
you want to do it here.

1446
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:23,661
That makes sense.
Yeah.

1447
01:03:23,661 --> 01:03:23,961
No,
no.

1448
01:03:23,961 --> 01:03:24,740
He's,
he's a writer.

1449
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,210
He's or I'll give them a good view and 
let's make it happen.

1450
01:03:28,211 --> 01:03:30,500
Let's bring it to the tail.
That's a fair,

1451
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:36,040
yeah.
That's a fair compromise.

1452
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:37,120
No milk.
No milk.

1453
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:37,780
No,
I'm kidding.

1454
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,613
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

1455
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:40,510
So are you going to be,
Whoa,

1456
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:40,901
whoa,
Whoa,

1457
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:42,750
whoa.
There's a lot of peppers in that bowl.

1458
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:46,060
What are we looking at night?
Oh wait,

1459
01:03:46,061 --> 01:03:46,540
wait.
That's it.

1460
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,760
Those will be no salad and Habanero.
Wait,

1461
01:03:48,761 --> 01:03:49,301
what?
Wait.

1462
01:03:49,301 --> 01:03:50,980
Hold on.
So those are all just Jalapenos.

1463
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:51,680
No,
no,

1464
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,060
no,
no,

1465
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:52,893
no.
Have an arrow.

1466
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,600
That's a Jalapeno.
Are you sure that's a Jalapeno?

1467
01:03:55,601 --> 01:03:56,650
I don't,
I'm not a look.

1468
01:03:56,651 --> 01:03:57,484
I'm not a,
I'm not a pepper expert over here and 

1469
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:03,910
spicy.
I want to make sure this is spicy.

1470
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,080
I can smell it.
All right,

1471
01:04:05,081 --> 01:04:07,150
take about you.
Tell me if that's like,

1472
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,340
if that's like a mild Jalapeno.
I'm gonna be pissed.

1473
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:10,953
Oh boy.
But these would be little babies will 

1474
01:04:11,921 --> 01:04:16,720
get you for sure until the spicy.
Him keep going.

1475
01:04:16,721 --> 01:04:17,560
Keep going man.
You got it.

1476
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:21,820
Oh,
is there a carbs in this?

1477
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:23,400
Uh,
no.

1478
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,234
No,
no ma'am.

1479
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:26,170
As I said,
you will be having diarrhea,

1480
01:04:26,171 --> 01:04:27,670
so don't worry about Carla.
Don't worry.

1481
01:04:27,671 --> 01:04:28,504
It's all out.
Are you guys hungry for your free a 

1482
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:32,590
gummy bears?
It'll be good.

1483
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:33,490
Oh,
thank you.

1484
01:04:33,491 --> 01:04:35,580
Uh,
Holy Moses is here.

1485
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:37,480
What spice level is that?
How many?

1486
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,320
Two,
two little babies time that spicy,

1487
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:43,270
but like,
it's kind of good,

1488
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,470
but I'm not.
It's Huh?

1489
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:51,090
It's really quiet.
I'm a little underwhelmed.

1490
01:04:51,091 --> 01:04:53,590
I was expecting cartoon flames to shoot 
out of his mouth.

1491
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:57,700
Now he's just loony tunes his license.
But it happened down like a pepper.

1492
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,800
I'm good.
Hang on you guys.

1493
01:04:59,801 --> 01:05:01,270
We're not here for good.
Yeah.

1494
01:05:01,271 --> 01:05:03,400
This is chopping this puppy down like 
it's no problem.

1495
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:05,050
We need to get to the next goal.
Well,

1496
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:07,870
I'm going to hustle though next goal.
Good that you're being real because then

1497
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:08,704
we'll know

1498
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:11,610
for sure just how much the real one 
messes you up.

1499
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,260
Now this hub,
he narrowed this,

1500
01:05:13,261 --> 01:05:15,600
we'll get ya these guys.
Sorry.

1501
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:17,710
It goes a lot.
So it's starting to burn building up

1502
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,083
now.
I have a friend who wants made a stew 

1503
01:05:20,261 --> 01:05:23,640
with these hobby narrows in Mexico and 
we were all up at 4:00

1504
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,800
AM shitting your brains though.
This is great.

1505
01:05:25,801 --> 01:05:28,120
Great Party series visit friend.
Good time.

1506
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:30,370
We shall shit in the same bucket and 
made a stew out of it.

1507
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:33,940
I hate,
as I was saying,

1508
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,353
she'd be like,
I don't want to finish a sentence but 

1509
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:37,324
I'm halfway through it and I want this 
to blog and write a little about the a 

1510
01:05:40,931 --> 01:05:41,764
bunch of dudes shit and in the same 
bucket and then making a swirling into 

1511
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:45,580
the same potion.
You know,

1512
01:05:45,581 --> 01:05:46,414
we all say something in our lives it's 
remembered is like our most powerful 

1513
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:53,230
quote and that might be yours.
That might be just chiseled in stone.

1514
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,420
Well guys,
50,000

1515
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,063
is next.
Can you bring in the ghost pepper and 

1516
01:05:58,781 --> 01:06:00,850
the Carolina very with those things look
like.

1517
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,810
That's my dog,
Dan.

1518
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,790
I'm almost done picturing the pepper.
Really Getting Ready to tread.

1519
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,440
It was going to jump into the milk bone.
This doesn't,

1520
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:10,603
I feel it.
This is not even that much and I'm 

1521
01:06:11,861 --> 01:06:12,694
already feeling it like in my stomach 
because I'm never eating this much ever 

1522
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:17,890
before.
It's usually like a little sliver.

1523
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,810
You know.
You feeling it more in your stomach then

1524
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:20,441
your mouth.
Yeah,

1525
01:06:20,441 --> 01:06:21,790
more than the stomach.
Oh Man.

1526
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:24,070
Your job when it starts,
I'm in trouble signing up.

1527
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,390
I'm in trouble,
man.

1528
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:29,260
You're going to be eating the entire 
pepper for all of these.

1529
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,500
Yeah.
See not that big yellow ones.

1530
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:34,150
Well,
well bring in the Carolina reaper in the

1531
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:35,801
wait,
wait,

1532
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:36,251
wait.
Oh,

1533
01:06:36,251 --> 01:06:39,550
just just to show you in a reaper.
Terrifying name.

1534
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:40,091
Just,
Oh,

1535
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:41,260
we're at 26,000
guys,

1536
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:43,070
keep going.
Keep in mind.

1537
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:48,160
Or if somebody donates $1,000,
I will lick the Carolina reaper.

1538
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:53,180
I know that doesn't sound nuts.
You had to like lick the inside dead.

1539
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:54,960
Tell me about your experience earlier 
date.

1540
01:06:54,961 --> 01:06:56,220
Thank you so much.
Yeah,

1541
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:59,410
I was just curious.
So I tore off a tiny little piece of one

1542
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:00,850
of these Carolina reapers,
which by the way,

1543
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:04,090
they are dried because they are not in 
seasonal current Lord.

1544
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,520
And yeah,
I found out when I looked it up,

1545
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,190
the dried ones are actually even 
spicier.

1546
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,270
Oh boy.
So yeah,

1547
01:07:10,271 --> 01:07:11,104
I just,
I just licked the tiniest little corner 

1548
01:07:12,551 --> 01:07:16,030
of it and it was about 30 minutes of 
pain go out of my mouth.

1549
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:16,893
Yeah.
So,

1550
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:17,471
well,
let me see.

1551
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:20,080
Oh Wow.
Where'd you guys get these from?

1552
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,910
They'll order them online.
Yeah.

1553
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,120
Okay guys,
what things are moving along?

1554
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:27,190
We're at 26,000
and a half.

1555
01:07:27,191 --> 01:07:30,970
Come on close.
Want to donate some money?

1556
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,160
I have only a thousand dollars.
I want to get,

1557
01:07:33,161 --> 01:07:34,570
I want to,
I want to sweeten this,

1558
01:07:34,571 --> 01:07:35,404
mix it up.

1559
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:38,350
I want to sweeten this a prideful.
What if we do?

1560
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:40,510
What if we do a,
um,

1561
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:45,130
one of these poles where either your 
licking this,

1562
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,053
either you're looking at the pepper or 
who you're at this table is brave 

1563
01:07:48,161 --> 01:07:48,994
enough.
Justin,

1564
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:50,560
you're not even anything.
We'll do it.

1565
01:07:50,561 --> 01:07:51,490
No,
I'll do her in it.

1566
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:56,500
You can't because she's pregnant or even
the intern or in the intern.

1567
01:07:57,970 --> 01:08:00,100
And so everybody who donates like how's 
it about,

1568
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,690
how does that work on the poll?
Let's,

1569
01:08:01,691 --> 01:08:03,250
let's start there and we can build our 
way.

1570
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:04,660
Okay.
Like taking a little nibble.

1571
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:06,340
Yeah,
but can we say,

1572
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:09,070
I don't know,
cause I find out what you get in on this

1573
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:11,870
with us licking the pepper.
It's just licking it.

1574
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:15,110
Can somebody,
but I don't know.

1575
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,003
Or Sheeko can you take poor a little 
frederick out and he's at the door 

1576
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:20,293
maybe.
I think he needs to go outside possibly 

1577
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:22,670
for a little diarrhea.

1578
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,100
A little foreshadowing of what you 
always sell.

1579
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:25,973
Does it?
Yeah.

1580
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:28,400
So let's make it,
let's make it three ways.

1581
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:29,330
Three way,
Paul.

1582
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,343
Every,
every donation is you get to vote for 

1583
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:32,660
it.
Either you,

1584
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:36,170
Justin or me who takes a lick of a 
pepper at the end of a certain amount of

1585
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:37,850
time to do that.
I'm,

1586
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:38,880
I'm in,
I'm totally,

1587
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:41,360
and we set that up easy to get turned in
or no.

1588
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:42,471
Oh,
sure.

1589
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:43,304
Yeah.
Let's make it four then just because of 

1590
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:45,420
the little wildcard.
Yeah.

1591
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:49,220
And do you copy that?
And so as a pull between who you and the

1592
01:08:49,221 --> 01:08:50,330
intern,
you,

1593
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,620
Alex,
Justin,

1594
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:53,203
Alex,
who gets for Hulu and people can donate 

1595
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,230
to vote for who has to look the pepper,
let's say.

1596
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,390
Let's put it all together.
Let's say after whatever.

1597
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,630
We have the call with the CEO of direct 
relief right now.

1598
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,240
And after that call,
yeah.

1599
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,800
Coming up and I'm a woman yelling in a 
couple minutes to answer that call.

1600
01:09:09,801 --> 01:09:10,634
We'll go to the,
to the poll and we'll have a pepper 

1601
01:09:12,201 --> 01:09:14,240
lick.
And can someone send me in water?

1602
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,850
We need water for the site.
I hate milk.

1603
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,393
I like almond milk.
It's a good thing we're filling a pool 

1604
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:22,290
with milk crate.
More uncommon.

1605
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,650
Um,
now,

1606
01:09:24,651 --> 01:09:27,500
um,
Dan,

1607
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:31,090
let me know when that poll is up so I 
can get all the good people donating.

1608
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,570
We're at 27,000
guys.

1609
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:37,571
26 your way to do a like a,
a chat only for the people who donate or

1610
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:39,920
only polls from you.
Only polls just pulls.

1611
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:43,220
Now Justin,
we were talking about rick and morty.

1612
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,740
Now you,
uh,

1613
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:47,210
thank you Mitchell.
God bless you.

1614
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:48,044
Appreciate you.
Now you guys were Ho now tell me about 

1615
01:09:50,391 --> 01:09:55,070
the negotiations because you guys were,
there was a bit of a,

1616
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:55,973
there was a lot of media,
a lot of speculation about what was 

1617
01:09:58,761 --> 01:09:59,500
going on about that.

1618
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,690
If they were going to renew the show or 
not paying the new season.

1619
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:03,921
Yeah,
no,

1620
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:04,990
I mean it was,
you know,

1621
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,870
it was a complicated,
just a complicated,

1622
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:09,704
uh,
I don't know how much I can get into 

1623
01:10:13,311 --> 01:10:13,880
the,
yeah,

1624
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,230
well you're going to get justin in 
trouble.

1625
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,250
No,
don't say anything.

1626
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:17,084
You don't want to you,
I'm only talking about what's in the 

1627
01:10:17,991 --> 01:10:18,824
media,
so I'm not,

1628
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:23,710
I mean ultimately it's like any show,
like at a certain point that there,

1629
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,553
there has to be,
are there that you just renegotiate and 

1630
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:31,670
it took a little bit,
but we did it some haggling repair that,

1631
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:32,241
that,
that,

1632
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:37,010
that's old news cause like that,
that that renegotiation was like we lock

1633
01:10:37,011 --> 01:10:39,110
that stuff down like way earlier this 
year.

1634
01:10:39,111 --> 01:10:40,550
Like we've been in production for a 
while,

1635
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:41,660
right?
Yeah.

1636
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,730
Um,

The poll is up.
How do people vote?

1638
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:48,890

1646
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:17,430
on the left,
there's a donation button.

1647
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,320
So I'm not sure.
A pull button.

1648
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:20,940
Sorry.
There's only one color.

1649
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:22,470
You are you kidding me?
Come on guys.

1650
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:24,631
Well,
Ian,

1651
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:25,620
it looks like $1.
Oh,

1652
01:11:25,621 --> 01:11:26,454
Justin,
$5 Ian and the intern $21 so that we 

1653
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:34,320
know when to cut it off.
So maybe,

1654
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:35,880
you know,
at the five o'clock hour,

1655
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:39,200
whoever's winning how long.
Yeah.

1656
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,053
Yeah.
Good call.

1657
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:41,730
Um,
so keep those,

1658
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:42,623
keep that cash.
Why the way I just want to show this 

1659
01:11:44,161 --> 01:11:46,290
off.
I don't know if there's a way we can get

1660
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:47,290
a,
Ooh,

1661
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:49,740
oh,
I'm done.

1662
01:11:49,741 --> 01:11:52,440
I'm done building this and whoever wants
it,

1663
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,520
it's up for auction.
All right,

1664
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:56,430
allison,
what's her name?

1665
01:11:56,431 --> 01:11:57,930
This value,
but I don't know,

1666
01:11:57,931 --> 01:12:00,210
cause I haven't seen this show,
this anime show.

1667
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,340
Is She just a torso in the show?
Like,

1668
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,720
I don't know.
I that'd be pretty rough.

1669
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:08,130
Just like bone.
She flies around.

1670
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:08,671
Yeah.
But,

1671
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:09,504
uh,
this is,

1672
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:11,190
this is it.
It's done.

1673
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,890
I'm putting it,
I'm officially finished.

1674
01:12:13,891 --> 01:12:14,550
I'm going to,
I'm going to,

1675
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:17,550
we can write all over it or do whatever.
Do you assemble a day?

1676
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,080
Oh,
not that many.

1677
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,080
Uh,
I'm done.

1678
01:12:22,081 --> 01:12:23,780
I'm not,
but I'm like,

1679
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:27,000
I'm done doing other anime girl models.
No,

1680
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:28,260
no.
I just weird other ones,

1681
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:29,240
but I'm like,
I the,

1682
01:12:29,241 --> 01:12:32,790
this was too much of my,
what is the significance of this?

1683
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,380
I don't know.
I just felt like building something.

1684
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,970
Uh,
I don't actually know.

1685
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:40,830
Just regular porn.
No,

1686
01:12:40,831 --> 01:12:41,664
no.
Have you?

1687
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,320
I've,
I mean I've checked it out,

1688
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:48,000
but we're all married and Heela I've 
literally adults under,

1689
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,760
what's the hubbub?
Hentai porn is like God telling me,

1690
01:12:51,761 --> 01:12:52,890
Oh,
life Hentai porn.

1691
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,740
Uh,
in real life.

1692
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:57,300
What do you mean?
Like what that means?

1693
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,180
It's like they take like,
you know how the ads all animated?

1694
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,520
It's weird.
I don't constantly watch it,

1695
01:13:02,521 --> 01:13:03,260
that's for sure.
I'm like,

1696
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:06,680
you're it with live action.
It's like cool world because they have a

1697
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:09,360
lot of like tentacles and shit.
So like they have that,

1698
01:13:09,361 --> 01:13:12,150
but they have like prop tentacles and 
they like crepe prop,

1699
01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:15,120
mother's porn where they put tentacles 
and they insert that.

1700
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,740
I mean you can probably,
have you seen that?

1701
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,750
Have you worked off too?
I haven't worked on it.

1702
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:21,450
Did we pull that up and take a quick 
look?

1703
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,600
Maybe not.
Yeah.

1704
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:26,010
The CEO of drugs.
Let's ask them.

1705
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,240
Hey,

1713
01:13:43,591 --> 01:13:44,630

We're up to 28,000

1728
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,070
guys going to donate $10 million just to
get his hands on that.

1729
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:16,390
No,
I'm winning.

1730
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:18,863
You got a little popular.
You want it to look that pepper budget 

1731
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:23,980
and 19 verse 179 and the intern that's 
moving.

1732
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:26,140
Nobody has put it on the screen.
Yeah.

1733
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,070
Yeah.
Can we see this?

1734
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,780
Wait,
when did I just like alive?

1735
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:29,660
Nobody.
Fuck it.

1736
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:30,551
I was like,
oh,

1737
01:14:30,551 --> 01:14:32,080
this is great.
It was all in,

1738
01:14:32,081 --> 01:14:32,831
not me,
dude.

1739
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,740
There's no way I have to look that 
peppermint a year and I should have gone

1740
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:39,130
in for something worse.
All right.

1741
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:40,143
Oh,
Ian's got shooting right in there and 

1742
01:14:41,921 --> 01:14:43,870
put in on the mic for him.
How is he sweating?

1743
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,820
How's he feeling?
Dare.

1744
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:46,150
I'm going to go,
I'm going to go out in the main room for

1745
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:48,850
two seconds just to get this,
get this.

1746
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:52,450
Justin's going home.
Sound of a door.

1747
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:53,230
Slam car.

1748
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:56,530
Driving off.
Can I not hear Ian?

1749
01:14:56,531 --> 01:14:57,364
I want to hear him.
Who Do you think is going to win this 

1750
01:14:58,151 --> 01:15:00,550
one?
I think they gotta be,

1751
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:01,983
it's gotta be you.
I feel like someone's in a drop 500 on 

1752
01:15:03,851 --> 01:15:06,730
you real quick at the last second while 
I'm already winning.

1753
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:07,840
I mean,
Ian,

1754
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,850
come on.
Did you drop money watching?

1755
01:15:09,851 --> 01:15:12,250
She's going to drop 500 on me.
Oh,

1756
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:15,430
that would be fucking amazing.
And she would wait until the last second

1757
01:15:15,431 --> 01:15:17,410
to that.
She's kind of a dark horse that way.

1758
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:19,930
That would be something special.
Dude,

1759
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:21,730
Justin's lucking out right now,
man.

1760
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:23,770
Yeah,
somebody I,

1761
01:15:23,771 --> 01:15:24,400
you know.
Well,

1762
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,810
we're going to keep on it.
We're going to keep,

1763
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:28,910
donate some money for Justin.
Well,

1764
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:29,830
let's see.
I wonder,

1765
01:15:29,831 --> 01:15:32,160
is that cheating?
No,

1766
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:33,203
no.
I mean we just invented the rules the 

1767
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:35,284
second ago,
so I'm going to say it's not cheating 

1768
01:15:36,191 --> 01:15:36,460
then here.

1769
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:40,210
I'll put it thousand on.
Just uh,

1770
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:42,410
well I don't want him to know though.
Yeah.

1771
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,570
Yeah.
Also we've got to do it quick while he's

1772
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:44,404
out of the room.
I think I hear you just ran out to the 

1773
01:15:45,431 --> 01:15:46,870
bathroom.
Can you put it Dan,

1774
01:15:46,871 --> 01:15:50,450
can you put a thousand on Justin for us 
from you?

1775
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:53,380
Yeah,
that's a great idea.

1776
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,100
We gave Dan our card,
so I have,

1777
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:55,973
I have Thomas a on standby.
Are you ready to do to for me to pipe 

1778
01:15:58,091 --> 01:15:59,030
them in?
Um,

1779
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:00,310
yeah.
Hold on one sec.

1780
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:02,950
Let's wait for Justin something back or 
maybe we'll do it real fast.

1781
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:08,350
I was saying we gave Dan our card so 
that he could bid for us.

1782
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,273
Donate for us while we're in here.
So Dan is going to throw down on our 

1783
01:16:12,251 --> 01:16:13,084
behalf a thousand.
Justin's gonna come back and be like 

1784
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:16,240
2000.
Good luck.

1785
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:18,850
Outbidding us.
Um,

1786
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:20,560
so on hold,
we're waiting for,

1787
01:16:20,561 --> 01:16:21,394
Justin is the CEO of direct relief.
Who's the beneficiary of our charity 

1788
01:16:26,891 --> 01:16:28,840
stream?
Thomas Tighe.

1789
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:33,670
If I'm saying your last name wrong,
that's because Mitchell betrayed me.

1790
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:36,830
You betrayed my trust.
Um,

1791
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:40,390
so joey,
tell me what's the weirdest thing you've

1792
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:44,980
jerked off to you?
I don't even know.

1793
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:47,980
I don't jerk off to weird things.
What's your category?

1794
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:50,320
What do you like?
Just like,

1795
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:53,590
I like skinny bitches.
Why do you say bitches?

1796
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,420
Well,
when I'm watching porn,

1797
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:58,180
it's like you,
you like the demeaning factor.

1798
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,493
Do like you say skinny bitches.
So that implies somehow that you like 

1799
01:17:02,241 --> 01:17:04,660
the demeaning and I just,
I mean,

1800
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:05,890
any grill does porn.
It was like,

1801
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,440
I feel like he couldn't call them 
bitches,

1802
01:17:08,441 --> 01:17:09,020
you know,
like,

1803
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,570
hmm.
I might say women,

1804
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,820
they're doing porn.
Did Skinny,

1805
01:17:13,821 --> 01:17:14,750
skinny chicks.

1806
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:19,940
Do you not like sick leave Guinea?
Just like Ben bitches.

1807
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:21,440
Petite.
Petite,

1808
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,431
petite.
That's the word.

1809
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:23,280
Yeah.
That's interesting.

1810
01:17:23,281 --> 01:17:24,650
You like the t?
Where did you watch?

1811
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,120
I'm asking the questions here.
What do you watch?

1812
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:30,080
You know,
I don't,

1813
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,000
I don't watch weird stuff.
I like,

1814
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,710
I like it.
I like,

1815
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:36,050
you know,
I like pretty girls.

1816
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,300
That sounds so good.
It's so perverse.

1817
01:17:38,301 --> 01:17:40,890
That sounds so scary.
Monster.

1818
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:44,580
That sounded so weird.
I said I just,

1819
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:47,990
you know,
I like pretty girls.

1820
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,870
God.
Your tone embarrassing.

1821
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:52,970
No,
but seriously,

1822
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,210
let's not talk about what I like.
I like Fart porn.

1823
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,440
Bart.
Yeah,

1824
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:01,490
me too.
Do you have a favorite a star?

1825
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:03,770
He's the CEO of direct relief and 
listening are probably,

1826
01:18:03,771 --> 01:18:06,710
luckily he is.
Is he like reevaluating his choice to be

1827
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:09,800
associate with like,
you knew what he's getting himself to.

1828
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,950
Justin rolland pepper sprayed joey cells
in the face last year.

1829
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:13,803
I can't say.
You don't know what you're getting 

1830
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:16,430
yourself into,
Joe.

1831
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:18,260
Uh,
Justin is pooping.

1832
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:20,000
You know,
you know what I'd like to do?

1833
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,190
Do you want to talk more about your porn
preferences,

1834
01:18:22,191 --> 01:18:23,120
Joey?
No,

1835
01:18:23,121 --> 01:18:23,954
let's not do that.

1836
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:30,180
Justin's walking back in right now and I
have Thomas on Stan.

1837
01:18:30,181 --> 01:18:32,720
We're up to $29,000
guys,

1838
01:18:32,721 --> 01:18:34,940
keep it going for this.
This,

1839
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,400
you're eating that mall.
No,

1840
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:37,613
this is small but deadly.
And Joey here is looking a little too 

1841
01:18:40,851 --> 01:18:42,470
frank.
He's looking a little too jolly.

1842
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:45,290
He's look a little too happy.
We got to get the milk flowing.

1843
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:46,124
But in the meantime I do is we have the 
CEO of direct relief on the line with 

1844
01:18:50,091 --> 01:18:52,880
us.
Thomas Tighe go ahead and uh,

1845
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:56,000
please welcome to the show of Thomas 
Standby.

1846
01:18:56,001 --> 01:18:57,410
I'm going to pipe them in in just a 
moment.

1847
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,790
Here we go.
All right.

1848
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:06,560
Taking them live right now.
Here we go.

1849
01:19:06,561 --> 01:19:09,910
Hey Thomas.
Hello.

1850
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,740
Welcome.
Thanks for calling in.

1851
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,570
Thank you so much.
Pleasure to be here.

1852
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:16,483
Thanks for what you're doing.

1853
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:18,630
Oh well let me ask you,
how do you,

1854
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,750
how do we say your last name?
Is it tighe.

1855
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:23,980
Okay,
thank God.

1856
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:26,120
Because I was going to fire an intern if
they,

1857
01:19:26,121 --> 01:19:29,530
if I had a mispronounced,
so,

1858
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:32,490
so thank you so much.
Um,

1859
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:34,803
now since we got you here,
maybe you can tell us a little bit 

1860
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:37,511
about,
you know,

1861
01:19:37,511 --> 01:19:42,511
how the money we raise affects you guys 
and specifically how it goes to help the

1862
01:19:43,301 --> 01:19:46,090
people who lost their homes and 
everything and the wildfires.

1863
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:48,490
Well,
first of all,

1864
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:50,610
I really can't thank you enough for what
you're doing.

1865
01:19:50,611 --> 01:19:51,840
It's um,
you know,

1866
01:19:51,841 --> 01:19:52,674
these things.
He had a lot of attention at the time 

1867
01:19:53,731 --> 01:19:56,010
and then there's so much news coming at 
people,

1868
01:19:56,011 --> 01:20:00,030
it's easy to forget.
So I think what direct relief does every

1869
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:00,863
day is try to work to make sure that 
their health services available for 

1870
01:20:04,081 --> 01:20:06,540
people who need them and can afford 
them.

1871
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,583
And on an everyday basis we work with 
the local nonprofit community health 

1872
01:20:12,091 --> 01:20:13,190
centers,
um,

1873
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,470
free and charitable clinics all around 
the United States.

1874
01:20:16,471 --> 01:20:18,300
And you know,
we're based in California.

1875
01:20:18,301 --> 01:20:21,600
So that's where we started.
So that's typically where we plug in and

1876
01:20:21,601 --> 01:20:23,460
in Butte county.
And um,

1877
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:26,130
just like last year in Sonoma,
Napa when the fires hit,

1878
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,070
these places that serve people who are 
vulnerable,

1879
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:31,920
even on a good day is where we plug in.
Cause there's such,

1880
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,870
so deeply rooted in the communities.

1881
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:36,510
And unfortunately I think,
um,

1882
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:39,240
what happened in paradise was just kind 
of unprecedented.

1883
01:20:39,241 --> 01:20:40,780
I think it,
again,

1884
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:45,460
it caught us by surprise here in this 
kind of new abnormal mistake and kind of

1885
01:20:45,461 --> 01:20:47,020
the devastation that just,
you know,

1886
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,530
cause a lot of deaths caused a lot of 
people to flee.

1887
01:20:49,531 --> 01:20:53,940
So what we did is kind of what we do and
checked in from a health perspective,

1888
01:20:53,941 --> 01:20:54,774
what can we do immediately?
And ended up just rushing on daily 

1889
01:20:57,991 --> 01:20:58,824
deliveries,
things from kind of the masks for the 

1890
01:21:01,141 --> 01:21:03,330
smoke and the inhalers for people who 
were,

1891
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:05,310
you know,
had breathing problems,

1892
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,420
the oxygen concentrators,
um,

1893
01:21:07,421 --> 01:21:09,300
that,
that seniors often need,

1894
01:21:09,301 --> 01:21:11,880
but particularly if they're evacuated 
and putting a shelter,

1895
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:13,253
um,
and just basic drugs and things like 

1896
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:16,014
that up up.
All the evacuees ended up in these 

1897
01:21:18,211 --> 01:21:21,690
temporary shelters and they all got hit 
with the norovirus,

1898
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:26,780
which is kind of this horrible disease 
of like vomiting and diarrhea.

1899
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:29,580
So it was just about as bad as you can 
imagine.

1900
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:30,953
But you know,
the people who we were working with who 

1901
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:35,520
were kind of staff from the hospital 
that was burnt out,

1902
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:36,893
they set up a clinic in the East Avenue 
Church up in Chico and were just so on 

1903
01:21:40,681 --> 01:21:41,160
it,
you know,

1904
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,390
just really,
you know,

1905
01:21:42,391 --> 01:21:45,360
just working 24 hours a day with 
nothing.

1906
01:21:45,361 --> 01:21:46,194
So that was kind of where we started.
And since then we've been continuing to 

1907
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:50,304
work with the kind of the local public 
health officials who were kind of 

1908
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:56,150
overwhelmed and even the firefighters 
and um,

1909
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,620
kind of the first response teams that,
you know,

1910
01:21:58,621 --> 01:21:59,454
they,
so many people got deployed from around 

1911
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:03,980
the state and we've worked with them a 
lot and saw last year,

1912
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:08,700
even here in Santa Barbara where we were
burned out and then had a debris flow,

1913
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,770
you know,
after five minutes of rain the hill came

1914
01:22:10,771 --> 01:22:11,604
down.

1915
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:14,130
Um,
sometimes they need help for specialized

1916
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:17,340
gear or just terrain vehicles.
They can go out and do the,

1917
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,673
unfortunately in paradise,
it's the remain recovery and kind of 

1918
01:22:20,821 --> 01:22:22,800
identifying that.
So we're working with all of them.

1919
01:22:22,801 --> 01:22:24,380
And um,
you know,

1920
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:29,400
we get money like what you're raising 
for a particular place.

1921
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:32,070
It's for that place.
It's not for director leaf.

1922
01:22:32,071 --> 01:22:32,491
It's,
you know,

1923
01:22:32,491 --> 01:22:37,020
we look at ourselves as trustees and 
make sure that the people know that it's

1924
01:22:37,021 --> 01:22:38,370
there.
The money's going.

1925
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:40,200
If they want us to buy something for 
him,

1926
01:22:40,201 --> 01:22:41,034
if money is needed,
we'll transfer the funds and we've 

1927
01:22:43,561 --> 01:22:44,394
already started committing funds to some
of the local groups that are just doing 

1928
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:49,110
such good work,
nothing.

1929
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:49,973
And um,
and we're in a position where we can 

1930
01:22:51,781 --> 01:22:54,750
cover all the expenses related to that 
out of,

1931
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:58,080
you know,
our normal organizational expenses.

1932
01:22:58,081 --> 01:23:00,240
So anyway,
really appreciate it.

1933
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:01,074
Particularly now after it's kind of out 
of the headlines what you and your team 

1934
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:05,350
are doing,
um,

1935
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,213
for a whole different audience and the 
type who probably think about direct 

1936
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,840
relief,
her stuff like this all the time.

1937
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:12,520
It really means a lot,
you know,

1938
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:13,720
can't thank you enough.

1939
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:14,741
Thank you.
I mean,

1940
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:16,270
it sounds like you guys are doing 
amazing.

1941
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,133
Yeah.
And port and work so grateful that this 

1942
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:19,960
exists.
That we could set this up.

1943
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:25,140
Can I ask a question?
I just wanted to,

1944
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:28,000
I just wanted to know,
um,

1945
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:28,950
you know,
there's been a,

1946
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:32,620
we were talking about how you guys have 
this like amazing rating,

1947
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:38,110
like you're number one in terms of its 
transparency and I just was curious like

1948
01:23:38,111 --> 01:23:40,570
what goes into that kind of,
what,

1949
01:23:40,571 --> 01:23:42,430
what's,
what's the reason for rating like that?

1950
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:44,410
Cause you guys are so trusted.

1951
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:46,470
Yeah.
It,

1952
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:47,520
a lot of it's just,
you know,

1953
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,030
what you'd expect.
I mean,

1954
01:23:49,031 --> 01:23:49,864
how much money did you spend on 
fundraising to get the money that you 

1955
01:23:52,781 --> 01:23:55,600
received?
And that's a big point of contention.

1956
01:23:55,601 --> 01:23:56,920
People don't,
generous,

1957
01:23:56,921 --> 01:23:57,754
big surprise.
They don't like sending a dollar in and 

1958
01:23:59,591 --> 01:24:02,110
having half of it's sent back on the 
mail that they're going to throw away.

1959
01:24:02,111 --> 01:24:04,990
So we've never done that.
I mean I think our model has been,

1960
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:07,220
you know,
we work out of a warehouse and um,

1961
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,300
kind of functionally what we do is,
you know,

1962
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,090
it's a distribution center so we can,
uh,

1963
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:15,520
we have to have specialized licensing 
for the medications that we hold,

1964
01:24:15,521 --> 01:24:18,940
but it's all provided free of charge.
We encourage companies to,

1965
01:24:18,941 --> 01:24:19,774
you know,
make their products available at no 

1966
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:24,010
charge,
we will handle them as well.

1967
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:24,844
And with all the same accreditation that
any pharmacy or chain drugstore would 

1968
01:24:28,961 --> 01:24:29,140
use.

1969
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:31,060
We're,
we have the same accreditation that,

1970
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,553
to handle these things.
But that's kind of the dilemma we're in 

1971
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:36,000
as a society,
right?

1972
01:24:36,001 --> 01:24:36,834
Cause if you have money,
you're very well served and people 

1973
01:24:38,381 --> 01:24:39,970
target you,
they know a lot about you,

1974
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:43,030
they know your preferences.
And if you're not a consumer,

1975
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:44,643
you're kind of off the grid.
So I think what we're trying to do in 

1976
01:24:47,141 --> 01:24:47,974
general,
it's just bring that level of kind of 

1977
01:24:50,261 --> 01:24:53,410
efficiency in delivery of services to 
people.

1978
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:56,080
Not because there's any,
we do it for free.

1979
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:56,914
So there's no profit incentive.
But we know that it can be done well 

1980
01:24:59,411 --> 01:25:02,540
with these tools that exist 
technologically and that,

1981
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:04,780
so they can,
that's everyday trying to bring,

1982
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:05,713
um,
kind of the resources that exist and 

1983
01:25:07,241 --> 01:25:08,074
efficient way to the people who need 
them and can't afford them for health 

1984
01:25:10,871 --> 01:25:11,621
services.
You know?

1985
01:25:11,621 --> 01:25:12,454
And,
um,

1986
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:15,400
it's pretty basic and,
but we have big gaps.

1987
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:19,900
Even like California,
the richest state in the richest country

1988
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:22,690
in the history of the world.
And yet,

1989
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:23,703
you know,
we have kind of a big problems that are 

1990
01:25:25,031 --> 01:25:26,140
chronic,
um,

1991
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,033
up and down the state.
And so I think what we can do as a 

1992
01:25:28,961 --> 01:25:32,260
private group is we're not political,
we're not religious,

1993
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:33,094
but just deal with the people that we 
know are deeply committed in their own 

1994
01:25:35,741 --> 01:25:37,150
communities and try to say,
look,

1995
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,073
how can we help?
Let's see if we can put together a 

1996
01:25:39,881 --> 01:25:44,770
structure that's going to serve you well
and get your patients stuff that we know

1997
01:25:44,771 --> 01:25:46,330
they can't afford.
Cause it's expensive,

1998
01:25:46,331 --> 01:25:50,710
whether it's insulin or an inhaler,
things that if you don't have,

1999
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,960
you will get sick,
stay sicker,

2000
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:53,923
skits,
stay sicker longer and often die sooner 

2001
01:25:56,501 --> 01:25:59,290
then just because of your financial 
status.

2002
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:00,850
And I don't think anyone wants that,
but,

2003
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:02,200
um,
you know,

2004
01:26:02,201 --> 01:26:05,600
I think we just are so committed to 
really help these,

2005
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,290
you see these people up in beauty.

2006
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:09,140
Like they were reluctant and we said,
look,

2007
01:26:09,141 --> 01:26:11,180
we've received money.
This is for you.

2008
01:26:11,181 --> 01:26:14,990
We want to spend to give you $50,000.
Cause I personally was up there,

2009
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:16,760
I delivered the insulin when they needed
it.

2010
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,073
I drove up there and um,
and I wanted to see them and let them 

2011
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:20,901
know.
It's like,

2012
01:26:20,901 --> 01:26:21,734
look,
there's a lot of people pulling for you 

2013
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,950
and this is what we can do.
But you know,

2014
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:26,863
we said,
look,

2015
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:29,060
how are you paying for this?
You guys are working for free.

2016
01:26:29,061 --> 01:26:30,290
And they said,
oh,

2017
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:31,550
but you know,
we're okay.

2018
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:34,310
That seems like too much money,
you know,

2019
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:36,020
$50,000
to,

2020
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:36,890
you know,
take care of a,

2021
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:37,724
basically a standup hospital and clinic 
for hundreds of people who had no other 

2022
01:26:41,271 --> 01:26:42,104
options.
So,

2023
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:43,880
I mean,
they were really reluctant to take it.

2024
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:44,870
And we said,
look,

2025
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,233
it's for you.
We have to give it to you were a 

2026
01:26:47,511 --> 01:26:50,480
trustee.
But that reluctance of,

2027
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:53,630
um,
kind of acceptance because you know,

2028
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:57,920
the concern that there may be someone 
else who needs it more was,

2029
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,940
you know,
quite touching and inspiring and sad and

2030
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:04,280
a lot of ways too.
So anyway,

2031
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:05,114
it's,
it's a privilege for us to do it and to 

2032
01:27:06,861 --> 01:27:09,830
have people like you and your audiences 
and I'll,

2033
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:10,733
you know,
amazingly talented people on the 

2034
01:27:12,801 --> 01:27:14,750
creative side.
Um,

2035
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:18,710
it means a lot to pull together and help
folks like that.

2036
01:27:18,711 --> 01:27:20,960
And so anyway,
sorry,

2037
01:27:20,961 --> 01:27:21,794
that was a long answer.

2038
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:25,010
I appreciate it though

2039
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:27,783
here that the idea that the money is 
going to is actually going to be 

2040
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:34,750
legitimately on the front lines and 
helping a bunch of people.

2041
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:35,633
Like,
I dunno when I'm donating to something 

2042
01:27:37,181 --> 01:27:37,970
like this,
I'm like,

2043
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:39,040
ah,
what's going on?

2044
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:40,563
We're all very cynical and skeptical in 
this world that actually get you on the 

2045
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:44,524
phone and hear it.
They can hear your music is very 

2046
01:27:47,561 --> 01:27:48,394
powerful and we thank you for what you 
do and we thank you so much for calling 

2047
01:27:50,711 --> 01:27:51,544
in and uh,
we wish you guys all the best and I'm 

2048
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:56,860
just thanks for being the best,
the best of us.

2049
01:27:58,580 --> 01:27:59,413
Well,
thank you.

2050
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,280
I really,
I got to tell you,

2051
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:02,680
and I'm talking to you,
right?

2052
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:04,440
Tony,
Tony or communication guy.

2053
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:05,413
He kept running in here first is 
laughing and then increasingly nervous 

2054
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:13,290
giving me little notes about like I 
wrote down,

2055
01:28:13,291 --> 01:28:15,540
I have the following written down,
which is weird for me.

2056
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,220
Fart bombs,
question,

2057
01:28:17,221 --> 01:28:18,054
market commission,
raking over the coals and then some 

2058
01:28:21,811 --> 01:28:22,644
other things.
I can't,

2059
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:26,220
can't recall the nature of my job but I 
thought I'm freaking out.

2060
01:28:26,221 --> 01:28:27,780
I just thought these guys,
I mean we know you guys,

2061
01:28:27,781 --> 01:28:30,350
you've done some stuff for us in the 
past and uh,

2062
01:28:30,490 --> 01:28:34,200
so I'm so thankful and whatever it is 
you're talking about,

2063
01:28:34,201 --> 01:28:36,430
he also said there were,
we were looking hot pepper,

2064
01:28:36,431 --> 01:28:39,420
so please health related organization 
please don't get hurt.

2065
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:45,580
Well one of us gets hurt for the safety 
of thousands.

2066
01:28:46,741 --> 01:28:49,020
It's a,
it's the least we could do as you're out

2067
01:28:49,021 --> 01:28:49,854
there doing the actual hard work and I 
don't know if you have the stream open 

2068
01:28:51,991 --> 01:28:52,860
right now,
but this,

2069
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:55,590
uh,
this young man in the Santa suit here is

2070
01:28:55,591 --> 01:28:58,530
about too,
is very close to our next goal of eating

2071
01:28:58,531 --> 01:29:01,590
this raw habanero pepper.
So we're to need his,

2072
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:02,520
your blessings

2073
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,110
and your,
your best wishes for him.

2074
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,850
Is that Joey,
because I was watching earlier yesterday

2075
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:10,350
getting nervous,
but you always,

2076
01:29:10,351 --> 01:29:12,030
sally,
please be careful.

2077
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:17,960
Don't take a triple dare you know,
but thank you for all you've got to stop

2078
01:29:18,091 --> 01:29:18,830
out there,
Joey.

2079
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:19,900
Yes.
Well you,

2080
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,720
you've got to hedge your bets there,
Thomas,

2081
01:29:21,721 --> 01:29:25,470
because if you will,
if you wish him to much care you've got,

2082
01:29:25,471 --> 01:29:26,960
we're going to raise less money for you 
guys.

2083
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:29,440
Okay,
joey,

2084
01:29:29,441 --> 01:29:31,770
go for it.
Within the bounds of sanity.

2085
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:35,280
Tone it down,
Thomas.

2086
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:39,250
Right.
Thank you so much for calling in.

2087
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,100
We appreciate so much what you do and 
happy,

2088
01:29:42,101 --> 01:29:45,610
happy holidays.
Happy holidays and way to go.

2089
01:29:45,611 --> 01:29:46,990
I can't,
can't thank you enough.

2090
01:29:46,991 --> 01:29:50,200
Thank congratulations on all your 
individual successes.

Okay,

2152
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:20,313
Somehow we're going to be the only ones

Because the last one was a thousand.
That was us.

2161
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:41,290
Maybe.
Okay,

2162
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:44,950
so there you have it.
Nice job then.

2163
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:47,140
Now guys,

2164
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:48,363

end up looking this pepper because we 

2165
01:32:51,851 --> 01:32:54,910

guys.

2166
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:58,510
Now that journal alone is worth a 
hundred thousand.

2167
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:04,830
Do I need to go over the side?
These rick and morty?

so I don't know where they were.

2173
01:33:19,211 --> 01:33:21,190
I don't know where they are,
but they're basically,

2174
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:21,940
it's,
no,

2175
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:22,800

2188
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:56,221
Got Big hearts a grudge for whatever to 
beef is happening right now.

2189
01:33:56,710 --> 01:33:57,543
I can't keep track judged.
And you want me to show the skateboard 

2190
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:00,730
decks?
How do you tweet?

2191
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:03,470
Like I,
it's been sideways even know how to,

2192
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,580
I'm not even fucking kidding.
Where's the fucking button?

2193
01:34:06,581 --> 01:34:07,221
Bottom.
Oh,

2194
01:34:07,221 --> 01:34:08,054
I see.
Okay.

2195
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:11,170
Pickle Rick,
the most famous episode,

2196
01:34:11,171 --> 01:34:12,004
one of the most famous episodes.
Here's the red it didn't that win the 

2197
01:34:14,201 --> 01:34:14,991
Emmy pickled.
Yeah.

2198
01:34:14,991 --> 01:34:15,731
Yeah,
that's,

2199
01:34:15,731 --> 01:34:16,564
that's an actual record draft.
So there could be like should auction 

2200
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:22,640
off your emmy man.
It could be writing in there,

2201
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:26,210
there might be notes in there.
I just grabbed it.

2202
01:34:26,211 --> 01:34:27,010
I was like,
I was like,

2203
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:30,310
cause we keep everything.
So like that's a drafted,

2204
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:33,790
someone had it at the record.
There were multiple records.

2205
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:34,624
So I don't know.
What do you think there's any 

2206
01:34:35,051 --> 01:34:36,940
differences in this draft between the 
this,

2207
01:34:36,941 --> 01:34:37,774
and that's the other thing is these 
scripts are going to be different than 

2208
01:34:41,921 --> 01:34:43,780
the episodes that air,
cause they're in production.

2209
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:46,570
So there's going to be dialogue in here 
that no one's ever seen before.

2210
01:34:46,571 --> 01:34:49,540
Different jokes that you tried it.
I've never been out there.

2211
01:34:49,541 --> 01:34:52,360
It probably the biggest,
like there's another one,

2212
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:53,201
uh,
the,

2213
01:34:53,201 --> 01:34:56,170
the um,
uh,

2214
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,450
wasteland episode.
What,

2215
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,640
what's it called?
I Dunno.

2216
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:02,060
But like there's another script that's 
like going to be significantly different

2217
01:35:02,061 --> 01:35:04,120
than what era then one went through a 
lot of changes in production.

2218
01:35:04,121 --> 01:35:04,970
Pretty sure.
Yeah.

2219
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:08,990
So these are original scripts did a bit 
on some of these.

2220
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:12,740
I'm curious about what's in there.
That alone is like kind of amazing.

2221
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,770
I never get to see that.
Go over to the prizes.

2222
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:18,560
Don't do it for the chair.
He'd do it to win this incredible shit.

2223
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:19,633
Where's that skateboard deck?
So I want to show that because you're 

2224
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:21,890
very passionate about those.
On these,

2225
01:35:21,891 --> 01:35:22,431
on here,
Dan,

2226
01:35:22,431 --> 01:35:24,890
the skateboard decks,
I don't see them on this list.

2227
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:26,930
The uh,
the crew gift,

2228
01:35:26,931 --> 01:35:29,450
skateboard decks are on there.
That's not what you're talking about.

2229
01:35:29,451 --> 01:35:30,380
Sure.
Justin.

2230
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:31,700
Oh,
the new ones that he brought.

2231
01:35:31,701 --> 01:35:33,110
Just a primitive.
So there's a,

2232
01:35:33,111 --> 01:35:36,230
there's a set of four.
Are they on the new,

2233
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:38,600
the new rick and morty?
It's like the second.

2234
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,070
Yes,
yes.

2235
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:40,821
Oh,
that is it.

2236
01:35:40,821 --> 01:35:41,630
Yeah,
that is it.

2237
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:42,340
So anyway,

2238
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:43,710
the second,
it's the second,

2239
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:45,550
um,
in,

2240
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:46,403
in,
in the primitive a skateboard company 

2241
01:35:49,711 --> 01:35:50,544
decks the,
so it's like that's the full set of the 

2242
01:35:52,741 --> 01:35:56,860
second series.
The first series are all sold out there.

2243
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:58,320
Awesome decks.
They're like really,

2244
01:35:58,321 --> 01:35:59,154
really just beautiful looking in person.
And then this also comes with four tee 

2245
01:36:03,661 --> 01:36:04,830
shirts.
They're all rick and Morty,

2246
01:36:04,831 --> 01:36:07,920
primitive collaborations and then three 
pairs of socks.

2247
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:10,660
But really the decks or what?
That's like the prime,

2248
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,620
that's like the full set and that's like
the prime,

2249
01:36:13,621 --> 01:36:15,440
uh,
that's,

2250
01:36:15,441 --> 01:36:18,200

2253
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,650
Um,
they're not currently signed.

2254
01:36:25,651 --> 01:36:27,900
They're stolen their original shrink 
wrap but whatever,

2255
01:36:27,901 --> 01:36:30,060
whatever,
you know the winter wants.

2256
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,333
I'm sure they'd want it so we should,
I think I have a feeling we should sell 

2257
01:36:33,741 --> 01:36:36,560
these instead of raffle.
I know we have the way to go,

2258
01:36:36,561 --> 01:36:37,700
I promise.
Yeah,

2259
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:38,593
absolutely.
I think someone's more likely to just 

2260
01:36:40,371 --> 01:36:42,410
buy it for a thousand outright.
No,

2261
01:36:42,411 --> 01:36:42,651

2307
01:38:41,070 --> 01:38:41,903
That's good.
We should have lit myself on fire for 

2308
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:44,574
this one.

2309
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,930
Oh we have more.
We have more writing.

2310
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:52,890
You guys.
Dan,

2311
01:38:52,891 --> 01:38:53,411
why don't,
why don't,

2312
01:38:53,411 --> 01:38:54,244
why don't you guys just come in because 
it's too complicated since someone into 

2313
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:01,030
right and we don't have to think about 
it cause we will,

2314
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:02,510
I want to entertain,
I've got a lot of shit.

2315
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:07,520
Haven't gotten to go to the bathroom.
We'll wait here.

2316
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:08,453
I got a question for Justin because I 
was thinking about this the other day 

2317
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:12,473
cause I went into one of those like,
stores that like sell like a bunch of 

2318
01:39:15,811 --> 01:39:20,460
like random shit from TV.
Like when you guys make rick and Morty,

2319
01:39:20,461 --> 01:39:24,030
do you think about merchandise when 
you're making it or is it just something

2320
01:39:24,031 --> 01:39:25,420
that happens?
Um,

2321
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,333
I think,
I mean I have a very sort of toyetic 

2322
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:28,944
approach.
I hate to use that word because it's so 

2323
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:31,163
lame.
You are toys and you love your love 

2324
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:33,180
toys.

2325
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:36,040
I have a very full of toys.
Your offices full of toys.

2326
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,340
I over did that.
But whatever.

2327
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:39,300
Um,
yeah I have like a,

2328
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,520
I have a,
I have a toyetic approach to design.

2329
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:44,340
So like I,
I grew up loving toys.

2330
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:45,570
Yeah,
I'm obsessed.

2331
01:39:45,571 --> 01:39:48,620
I've been obsessed with toys.
He has a lot of like merchant,

2332
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:50,640
it's what it was like for,
for example,

2333
01:39:50,641 --> 01:39:52,680
like season one,
we didn't know that that was going to be

2334
01:39:52,681 --> 01:39:53,371
the case.
You know,

2335
01:39:53,371 --> 01:39:54,204
like no idea but still hoped best.
Like best case dream is to have is to 

2336
01:39:57,991 --> 01:39:59,850
have a single Rick Dahl is,
yeah,

2337
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:00,601
but,
but,

2338
01:40:00,601 --> 01:40:03,060
but,
but I guess it's sort of like by default

2339
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:08,940
my design sense is like designing things
to feel like they,

2340
01:40:08,941 --> 01:40:10,470
like they would make cool toy,
you know,

2341
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:12,360
like every character has that feeling,
you know,

2342
01:40:12,361 --> 01:40:13,194
like that's,
that's the holy grail is if you can 

2343
01:40:15,031 --> 01:40:17,520
design characters that would make cool 
action,

2344
01:40:17,521 --> 01:40:17,990
figure it out.

2345
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:21,450
Then now I'm on the same principles that
make a good cartoon design.

2346
01:40:21,451 --> 01:40:23,580
Make a good toy.
Like something that's simple,

2347
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:27,660
that's bold there reads from a mile away
that clear in silhouette entertaining,

2348
01:40:27,661 --> 01:40:31,350
interesting contrasting shape demand.
If you're making a fucking cartoon,

2349
01:40:31,351 --> 01:40:34,200
it's probably also going to be something
that's like really catchy as a toy.

2350
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:34,951
Yeah,
yeah,

2351
01:40:34,951 --> 01:40:35,790
absolutely.
Yeah.

2352
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:38,670
For character design for sure.
Um,

2353
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:39,623
yeah.
All those rules apply for good toy 

2354
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:41,670
design.
So yeah,

2355
01:40:41,671 --> 01:40:42,331
it's interesting.
It's,

2356
01:40:42,331 --> 01:40:46,790
but I don't think it's been outright,
I mean they're there,

2357
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:47,663
believe me,
there's times where I'm thinking about 

2358
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:49,441
like,
Oh man,

2359
01:40:49,441 --> 01:40:50,640
like,
like,

2360
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,860
you know,
certain things like rick's gone or like,

2361
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,900
I like the portal gun was definitely not
a thing.

2362
01:40:55,901 --> 01:40:58,330
We were thinking about a toy for when we
made that.

2363
01:40:58,390 --> 01:41:00,260
You probably,
that made it a little bit like fancier.

2364
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:03,710
It's,
yeah,

2365
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,310
totally aliens of them.
You'd like make it a little bit.

2366
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:09,910
That was definitely one that was not 
even considered.

2367
01:41:09,911 --> 01:41:11,770
But um,
but yeah,

2368
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:12,730
but,
but a lot,

2369
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:14,320
but there's,
there's been certain characters,

2370
01:41:14,321 --> 01:41:18,010
I'm trying to think of like a specific 
thing I think that I think is gone maybe

2371
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:22,720
or just a choice to like use a certain 
gun a bunch of times or like go back.

2372
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:24,970
Like we have so many guns design and 
it's like,

2373
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,370
Oh lets some of the cock sucker put 
$1,000

2374
01:41:27,371 --> 01:41:28,204
on me.

2375
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:35,160
It wasn't me,
wasn't me saying I'm just trying to make

2376
01:41:35,891 --> 01:41:38,800
this a little interesting man.

2388
01:42:11,201 --> 01:42:14,680
Red Pepper,
35,000

2389
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:19,810
over a dollar a viewer.
And that's incredible.

2390
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:21,670
I really think that,
uh,

2391
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:22,360
we got,
uh,

2392
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,320
um,
so go ahead and get,

2393
01:42:24,350 --> 01:42:26,500
we got to shout out to find people who 
have,

2394
01:42:26,501 --> 01:42:27,334
there's other,
there's other prize things that we 

2395
01:42:28,631 --> 01:42:30,370
haven't really talked about.
Yes,

2396
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,400
but we have Zach sees Zach subtype Cutie
Pie.

2397
01:42:33,670 --> 01:42:35,770
Ashley Marie,
Google.

2398
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:36,903
Oh God.
So Ashley Marie wants a ghoul 

2399
01:42:38,501 --> 01:42:40,690
vibrations.
Did nine 11 written on Joey.

2400
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:43,630
Okay.
We'd eat the whole pepper.

2401
01:42:43,631 --> 01:42:44,920
What does that,
uh,

2402
01:42:44,921 --> 01:42:46,660
so yeah,
I wasn't sure.

2403
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:50,170
D dbss or dbs student,
uh,

2404
01:42:50,171 --> 01:42:51,900
donated $500,
uh,

2405
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,230

or I'm sorry,

2406
01:42:53,231 --> 01:42:56,380
$100 to joey saying eat the whole 
pepper.

2407
01:42:56,381 --> 01:42:57,214
I don't know if he wants that written or
if he was just trying to get you to eat 

2408
01:42:59,171 --> 01:43:00,004
the whole prepper.

2409
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:03,940
We're at 37,000
guys,

2410
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:05,800
keep it coming.
And then a ricotta,

2411
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:09,100
this comic that was anonymous,
but thank you to whoever you are.

2412
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:12,070
Someone's he on me.
Joey,

2413
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,830
you just go ahead and we'll continue 
with the show as you.

2414
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,360
Um,
right on me.

2415
01:43:17,210 --> 01:43:18,043
No,
I've got some great things for us to 

2416
01:43:20,081 --> 01:43:21,070
watch.
If you guys would like,

2417
01:43:21,550 --> 01:43:23,470
I'd like to get your takes on some 
things we real quick.

2418
01:43:23,471 --> 01:43:25,540
Can we,
there's a couple of other really,

2419
01:43:25,570 --> 01:43:26,403
I mean,
I don't know how easy is it for the 

2420
01:43:27,341 --> 01:43:28,174
people that are going to the site to 
peruse and just find this out for 

2421
01:43:30,311 --> 01:43:31,144
themselves.
But like there's hell let's talk to up 

2422
01:43:32,231 --> 01:43:34,510
there.
But like anyone here hasn't checked out.

2423
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:36,340
Surprises should know that you need to 
check that out.

2424
01:43:36,350 --> 01:43:39,070
There's two massive Cryptozoic game 
prize packs.

2425
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:39,933
All that stuff will be signed or all the
rick and morty stuff will be signed by 

2426
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:43,360
me here.
Let me show it.

2427
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:44,270
Which one?
Um,

2428
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:47,770
it's the CRYPTOZOIC Games prize packs,
like these big ass.

2429
01:43:49,530 --> 01:43:50,560
Um,
there's also,

2430
01:43:50,561 --> 01:43:51,970
there's also,
uh,

2431
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:53,540
uh,
rick and morty trading cards.

2432
01:43:53,541 --> 01:43:55,760
Two of them.
One of them's a sketch card by me,

2433
01:43:55,761 --> 01:43:57,680
which is,
those are going to be really,

2434
01:43:57,681 --> 01:43:58,700
I don't think there's,
I think there's,

2435
01:43:58,701 --> 01:44:01,700
I don't know how many there are,
but there's not a lot I like,

2436
01:44:01,701 --> 01:44:05,270
literally there's not a lot of them.
And then there's also an autograph card,

2437
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:07,120
which also not a lot,
um,

2438
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:10,340
mixed into the decks or into the packs.
You know the,

2439
01:44:10,610 --> 01:44:12,530
the blind,
it's like trading cards,

2440
01:44:12,531 --> 01:44:14,120
you know what I mean?
Oh Hey little guy.

2441
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:16,250
Um,
so uh,

2442
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:17,900
that's,
that's also up there.

2443
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:19,640
What else?
What other cool shit is up there?

2444
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:20,953
I guess that's probably about it.
There's so many rewards including for 

2445
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:28,850
all the guys who just want to get 
something bad ass.

2446
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:33,851
This Christmas ps four pro and xbox x 
switch bundles all up there.

2447
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:38,210
Yes.
Justin did you brick cause you had pet?

2448
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:39,733
Oh is that what that should be?
Part of the thing that's by itself that 

2449
01:44:43,401 --> 01:44:45,200
is going to,
that's not rare.

2450
01:44:45,790 --> 01:44:49,100
It's not,
well I mean maybe justin either.

2451
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:51,590
Justin is trying to play it up now,
but I was like why?

2452
01:44:51,591 --> 01:44:54,680
Why are we putting a rick she pet bites.
Well that's why I know,

2453
01:44:54,681 --> 01:44:57,550
I was like can we bundle this stuff too?
Like no,

2454
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,730
no.
Cause you could take all the,

2455
01:44:58,760 --> 01:44:59,593
all the donations for the ric Chia pet 
and pull it in to what the bundle that 

2456
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:05,750
then the one guy's like,
I just want the ric cheap.

2457
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:08,670
They still limited.
How long would the other,

2458
01:45:08,730 --> 01:45:11,370
I have a Rick Chia pet.
I don't know.

2459
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:13,580
By Justin reuland.
Oh,

2460
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:15,680
I don't know.
Zero I guess.

2461
01:45:15,681 --> 01:45:18,080
Yeah,
let's hope there's also uh,

2462
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:19,213
uh,
the squanch games or trover saves the 

2463
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:23,130
universe pack.
Is that up there?

2464
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:23,940
Oh,
it's five.

2465
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:25,580
The,
the bidding is over.

2466
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:27,620
Yes.
Did you want to continue?

2467
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:29,690
So let's going up there.
No,

2468
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:30,553
we'll wait until it gets goes up.
So the pole that our first poll has 

2469
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:38,411
completed and then Ethan somehow thanks 
to Alex,

2470
01:45:39,201 --> 01:45:44,201
I'm sure a double agent anonymous 
donation a moment ago.

2471
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,190
Can you put it up?
Yeah,

2472
01:45:46,191 --> 01:45:47,420
let's see.
The final tally.

2473
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:49,050
That wasn't me.
I,

2474
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:50,473
you say a moment ago,
you're talking about when Alex was on 

2475
01:45:51,981 --> 01:45:52,814
his phone,
right?

2476
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:57,050
Weird coincidence was on my phone,
but I was not doing that.

2477
01:45:57,051 --> 01:45:58,060
I promise I was too.
Right.

2478
01:45:58,070 --> 01:45:59,120
Alex,
you wise guy.

2479
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:01,070
So,
but there you go.

2480
01:46:01,071 --> 01:46:02,540
We just raised three.
Like what?

2481
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,580
I mean that's like 2000 right there.

2482
01:46:07,010 --> 01:46:09,400
Almost three almost.
Great.

2483
01:46:09,401 --> 01:46:10,234
Well,
it looks like you got to look that 

2484
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:13,580
pepper.
So we are at,

2485
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:14,361
okay,
well let's,

2486
01:46:14,361 --> 01:46:17,390
let's create the next bowl.
You crying over licking it?

2487
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:23,660
Giovan munched a tasty little Jalapeno.
All right.

2488
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:24,494
Yeah,
I got ready to eat anything reading 

2489
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:27,653
this.
I'm going to end up with more spice in 

2490
01:46:29,181 --> 01:46:30,050
my mouth.
Then you are,

2491
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:34,040
oh,
James Wean Hoff gave us 1,100

2492
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:39,380
wait,
we're not missing any big donations.

2493
01:46:39,381 --> 01:46:40,480
Are We?
You guys able to,

2494
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:42,320
okay,
thank you.

2495
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:43,513
Oh,
this is like real time donations coming 

2496
01:46:44,661 --> 01:46:45,230
in.
Yeah.

2497
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:46,550
Oh that's,
that's really cool.

2498
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:47,413
Again,
you guys don't have to donate separate 

2499
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:49,980
raffles.
If you

2500
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:50,813
donate $1 separately,
it doesn't increase your chance of 

2501
01:46:53,431 --> 01:46:55,440
winning anything.
Oh yeah.

2502
01:46:55,441 --> 01:46:57,180
You could donate,
like you're saying,

2503
01:46:57,181 --> 01:46:58,014
like if you did,
if you did a dollar 20 different times 

2504
01:46:59,971 --> 01:47:00,804
on one thing,
same as 20 pinging around like do a 

2505
01:47:03,961 --> 01:47:04,794
dollar and this one I'm going to,
that's why I was saying bundle some of 

2506
01:47:06,241 --> 01:47:08,480
the ship.
There was a lot of confusion about the,

2507
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:10,170
yeah,
I don't know how.

2508
01:47:10,171 --> 01:47:11,010
I don't know.
Really.

2509
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:12,760
I wonder if you're still trying to 
change the rule.

2510
01:47:12,761 --> 01:47:16,010
What if we could raise the mammo because
all these $1 guys are killing it.

2511
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:16,920
Okay,
that's fine.

2512
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:17,521
No,
no,

2513
01:47:17,521 --> 01:47:18,600
no.
That's their,

2514
01:47:18,601 --> 01:47:19,434
their odds are less,
but like they're still able to 

2515
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:22,620
participate.
All right.

2516
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:23,543
Thank you for all your work the h three 
team has done in this livestream and 

2517
01:47:26,131 --> 01:47:26,911
podcast.
Happy.

2518
01:47:26,911 --> 01:47:29,820
See Isla Ethan putting out great content
on the h three sheet page.

2519
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,410
That's the luck with your baby,
Papa.

2520
01:47:31,411 --> 01:47:33,630
Bless.
Thank you Wayne.

2521
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:35,450
Why in,
Huh?

2522
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:36,720
Well that ain't,
did he,

2523
01:47:36,721 --> 01:47:37,554
um,
was that a poll donation or was that 

2524
01:47:39,571 --> 01:47:43,410
just a random thing then I'll go check.
I'm not sure what that was.

2525
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:44,790
All right.
Well regardless,

2526
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:46,290
I have to,
it's the liquor pepper now.

2527
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:49,770
So we've got the Carolina reaper.
No,

2528
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:52,030
I'm going to choose one.
Oh my God.

2529
01:47:52,031 --> 01:47:53,940
It says Carolina reaper.
What are you doing?

2530
01:47:53,970 --> 01:47:55,620
Okay,
so all right.

2531
01:47:55,621 --> 01:47:56,454
Yeah,
it does.

2532
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,640
You're right.
Oh my God.

2533
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,490
Do you want it right now?
Threader yeah.

2534
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:04,620
Do we have gloves?
Yeah,

2535
01:48:04,621 --> 01:48:06,960
let's turn up that pepper music.
Yeah.

2536
01:48:06,961 --> 01:48:11,280
Turn the pepper music.
Jumanji Hanson that have shredder.

2537
01:48:11,281 --> 01:48:12,900
Like Lick my hand.
Oh yeah.

2538
01:48:12,910 --> 01:48:14,280
Be Real good.
It's a good point.

2539
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:15,193
You're going to want it.
You're gonna want to wear gloves while 

2540
01:48:16,381 --> 01:48:17,214
you,
uh,

2541
01:48:17,510 --> 01:48:18,343
guys,
let's think of a new poll before I do 

2542
01:48:19,171 --> 01:48:22,350
this so we can get things moving so we 
can raise some cheddar cheese.

2543
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,140
Is there anything I can donate?
Let's see.

2544
01:48:25,141 --> 01:48:27,150
Let's see.
Let's see guys,

2545
01:48:27,151 --> 01:48:30,470
we're at 37,000.
Wait to the next goal.

2546
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:31,730
Oh,
come on.

2547
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:34,760
Come on for crazy.
Why don't we do a thing where,

2548
01:48:34,850 --> 01:48:35,840
well nevermind,
actually,

2549
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:39,020
were you about to suggest something that
would require you to look something?

2550
01:48:39,050 --> 01:48:39,411
No,
no,

2551
01:48:39,411 --> 01:48:40,244
no.
I was,

2552
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:43,880
I was going to say what would it be 
possible to rather than a pole.

2553
01:48:43,881 --> 01:48:47,330
I was thinking like maybe the next 
person who donates x amount,

2554
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:49,970
like decides what you draw or something 
like that.

2555
01:48:49,971 --> 01:48:51,020
You know what I mean?
Like sure,

2556
01:48:51,021 --> 01:48:51,501
sure.
Yeah.

2557
01:48:51,501 --> 01:48:53,440
You're way better at like,
like Improv draw.

2558
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:54,313
Like,
I just do.

2559
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:55,533
I like drag weird stuff that I,
if we were trying to think of something 

2560
01:48:57,261 --> 01:49:00,800
that was valuable that people would want
to donate for it probably be probably be

2561
01:49:00,801 --> 01:49:02,900
a message from our old buddy Rick 
Sanchez.

2562
01:49:02,901 --> 01:49:03,734
Right.
Seems like that seems that seems like 

2563
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:08,230
that around and give it a smell.
You're touching it.

2564
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:11,660
Oh Dude,
I already touched with my finger.

2565
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:12,730
It's super

2566
01:49:12,730 --> 01:49:14,050
dry.
So Sma,

2567
01:49:14,051 --> 01:49:16,350
everyone's pass that around and give it 
to pass it around.

2568
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:17,980
Mallet

2569
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:22,093
smell.

2570
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:25,270
Okay,
well I did this art.

2571
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,780
It's either,
is this skin spicy though?

2572
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:33,460
This is either going up for auction or,
or Ethan's swiping it.

2573
01:49:34,810 --> 01:49:35,643
All right,
well I'll tell you what do you call 

2574
01:49:36,941 --> 01:49:37,774

Cause let me tell you what I'm gonna do 

2575
01:49:38,321 --> 01:49:40,470

2577
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:44,040
let me tell you what's going on with 
this either.

2578
01:49:44,041 --> 01:49:46,380
I'm getting this for $1,000.
If somebody,

2579
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:48,040
doesn't this be a straight purchase?

2580
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:48,881
No,
no,

2581
01:49:48,881 --> 01:49:50,170
no.
Everything should be,

2582
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:55,380
it's mine.
Like me money or less money.

2583
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:57,213
Everybody still be raffled is all the 
original art up right now on the 

2584
01:49:59,771 --> 01:50:01,930

2586
01:50:04,091 --> 01:50:05,080

But look at this.

2587
01:50:05,081 --> 01:50:06,820
This is freaking incredible,
dude.

2588
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:10,460
And I will eat it.
Let's not go overboard.

2589
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:12,300
All right.
Do you want,

2590
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,153
do you want it though?
I do want because your mom already 

2591
01:50:14,471 --> 01:50:16,450
donated.
He's not going to appreciate this.

2592
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:20,080
Well I'll drop whatever she wants.
Whatever you want.

2593
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:20,680
Okay.
Yeah,

2594
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,200
I'll draw something cool.
I don't,

2595
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:25,080
I think she just wants like a little,
well let's show rick and morty.

2596
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:27,310
Let's put that up.
You know what?

2597
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:29,440
We have that chat,
that chat stream.

2598
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:30,723
Wait,
listen,

2599
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:33,130
if you donate a dollar,
can you put a comment next to it?

2600
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:33,993
Yeah.
That's how we can get a chat stream 

2601
01:50:35,561 --> 01:50:36,394
going.

2602
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:38,800
So why don't we put that up.
Okay,

2603
01:50:38,801 --> 01:50:39,410
good.
Okay.

2604
01:50:39,410 --> 01:50:42,130
And then why don't we ask the people who
are donating a dollar,

2605
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:43,653
do you,
should we add this on the thing to be 

2606
01:50:46,031 --> 01:50:47,290
like a raffle?
Like,

2607
01:50:47,291 --> 01:50:49,900
should we add this stupid thing as 
around,

2608
01:50:49,901 --> 01:50:54,901
I'll do as many $1 donation as I like to
show how people can donate.

2609
01:50:57,290 --> 01:51:00,810
W What are people choosing?
That word is asking.

2610
01:51:00,850 --> 01:51:03,040
We're just asking like do they want,
do they want,

2611
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:03,923
Oh,
next year there should be a way to pick 

2612
01:51:05,081 --> 01:51:08,440
many raffles and have one transaction.
Oh we need a new,

2613
01:51:08,441 --> 01:51:10,870
we need a new port.
We need a new poll.

2614
01:51:10,871 --> 01:51:12,820
How about the next bull?
Someone has to take a nip,

2615
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:15,370
like actually eat a little piece of it.
Did you hear that though?

2616
01:51:15,371 --> 01:51:20,090
He said he's somebody posted a comment 
saying next year there should be no way.

2617
01:51:20,890 --> 01:51:22,390
Oh yeah,
you're going to probably need some milk.

2618
01:51:23,390 --> 01:51:24,223
They saying that next year there should 
probably be a way to donate to multiple 

2619
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:32,110
with one transaction.
So you like add to cart,

2620
01:51:32,111 --> 01:51:33,220
add to cart,
add on our head.

2621
01:51:33,221 --> 01:51:35,110
That functionality exists on,
on the site.

2622
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:38,800
Well we'll have to get on it until the 
whatever the next poll.

2623
01:51:38,830 --> 01:51:40,630
A little nibble.
A little nibble.

2624
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:41,980
Come on.
No,

2625
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:45,400
maybe you should know before I go.
Here I go.

2626
01:51:45,401 --> 01:51:46,720
I'm looking at this.
Okay guys,

2627
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:49,360
we watch.
I'm nervous for you because I know we're

2628
01:51:49,361 --> 01:51:52,150
about to see.
I've just going to touch it on my tongue

2629
01:51:52,151 --> 01:51:52,984
is that is definitely,
I think you're looking at when you have 

2630
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:56,170
this up in the background,
people are,

2631
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,860
it's going crazy.
Damn.

2632
01:51:57,890 --> 01:51:59,620
What?
Stick that all the way,

2633
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:01,940
right click and give it a good good 
lift.

2634
01:52:02,170 --> 01:52:03,040
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2635
01:52:03,041 --> 01:52:04,720
That's a good lik,
oh my God.

2636
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:05,340
Oh,
what's up?

2637
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:06,340
What you want to show some stuff?

2638
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:10,750
I rubbed it on my tongue and it was like
immediately like a lot of pain.

2639
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:16,220
He's still tasting it like,
like where are you at?

2640
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:18,790
Just hit me.
Oh my God.

2641
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:19,301
Okay.
Yeah.

2642
01:52:19,301 --> 01:52:22,420
I'm curious.
The Carolina ghost pepper in your mouth.

2643
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:24,520
The doctor's office.
Smiley faces.

2644
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:26,140
Like,
like chart what number?

2645
01:52:26,141 --> 01:52:26,830
No,
it's not,

2646
01:52:26,830 --> 01:52:27,663
it's not very,
well I can't say because it's actually 

2647
01:52:30,101 --> 01:52:31,120
getting worse.
It's still,

2648
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:36,460
it's still working its way into your 
already going for the milk though.

2649
01:52:36,461 --> 01:52:38,650
You're like not even letting it get to 
it's,

2650
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:39,543
I mean I was,
all I did was kind of rub it on my 

2651
01:52:41,141 --> 01:52:45,190
tongue and I was shocked by it.
Like immediately blasted.

2652
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:48,440
Show your,
we're not even going to get there.

2653
01:52:48,441 --> 01:52:50,660
We'll be lucky if we even,
it gets you to eat a fucking,

2654
01:52:50,810 --> 01:52:51,643
let's do another poll for that.
Joey's solids flew here and you guys 

2655
01:52:56,451 --> 01:52:59,390
can't even get him to eat a hobby 
narrow.

2656
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:00,883
I want to,
I want to get to the Habanero Habanero 

2657
01:53:02,751 --> 01:53:03,584
quicker.
People are saying add the drawing as a 

2658
01:53:05,301 --> 01:53:07,300
raffle.
See,

2659
01:53:07,330 --> 01:53:08,440
look,
people want the drunk.

2660
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:11,150
Let Ethan keep the drawing.
It's all over the place.

2661
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:14,300
Someone's gave $5 just to let me keep 
it.

2662
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:17,330
Everybody's saying raffle it and one 
said I'm missing from the rewards.

2663
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:19,970
Whoa.
What does that mean?

2664
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:22,040
What does that mean?
Oh No,

2665
01:53:22,041 --> 01:53:25,070
she'd be at the bottom.
I just looked this up there.

2666
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:26,320
Yo,
what the fuck?

2667
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:27,980
What the fuck?
We're not getting donations.

2668
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:28,671
Oh yeah.
Why?

2669
01:53:28,671 --> 01:53:31,090
Hey Joey's not on the thing anymore.
Huh?

2670
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:37,390
What's going on here?
I took it down for a second cause uh,

2671
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,490
cause we're backed up on his Oh okay.
We got,

2672
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:42,080
we got to go send someone in here with a
sharpie.

2673
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:42,933
All right.
Give me a second.

2674
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:44,290
Full time.
Right all day.

2675
01:53:44,291 --> 01:53:45,920
And don't take it down either.
Brought some,

2676
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,120
yeah.
Don't take it down.

2677
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:48,150
Either.
Brought these decks.

2678
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:50,273
I Dunno.
I thought we should show some of the 

2679
01:53:51,791 --> 01:53:54,900
stuff cause I'm the pictures maybe don't
show how cool it is.

2680
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:57,950
Definitely don't.
So this is,

2681
01:53:57,970 --> 01:53:59,670
this is two of them.
Yup.

2682
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:01,050
Of the,

2683
01:54:01,051 --> 01:54:02,190
um,
primitive decks.

2684
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:03,053
Oops.
And then the back is like different or 

2685
01:54:05,191 --> 01:54:06,480
like different color.
It's cool.

2686
01:54:06,481 --> 01:54:07,314
There's also,
I think,

2687
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:10,770
see,
I don't think there is any grip tape and

2688
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:14,050
on this is the other two.
Whoa,

2689
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:15,390
Whoa,
whoa.

2690
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:18,350
There we go.
And uh,

2691
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:20,160
again,
like interesting.

2692
01:54:21,450 --> 01:54:21,991
Yeah.
These are,

2693
01:54:21,991 --> 01:54:25,560
these are,
these are really cool looking in person.

2694
01:54:25,561 --> 01:54:27,720
I mean it's like the,
it's like foil.

2695
01:54:27,721 --> 01:54:29,580
It's like a foil back.
But yeah.

2696
01:54:29,581 --> 01:54:33,600
So the whole set and then I'm gonna look
through

2697
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,670
these scripts and actually see for 
myself,

2698
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,271
dude,
Justin,

2699
01:54:36,271 --> 01:54:37,104
should we do a thing where if these are 
old people can request what you draw 

2700
01:54:41,641 --> 01:54:43,500
next with their comment?
No.

2701
01:54:43,501 --> 01:54:44,280
You,
you,

2702
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:44,851
me.
Yeah.

2703
01:54:44,851 --> 01:54:46,800
Yeah.
Way Better at that than I can't see.

2704
01:54:46,801 --> 01:54:47,461
Um,
okay.

2705
01:54:47,461 --> 01:54:47,950
Uh,
how,

2706
01:54:47,950 --> 01:54:49,200
how do we set it up,
I guess?

2707
01:54:49,201 --> 01:54:52,140
Uh,
even how do I set it up if I'm trying to

2708
01:54:52,141 --> 01:54:55,160
get people to request a drawing for me?
Like it's just this I'm,

2709
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:56,400
and then just look at it.
Just like,

2710
01:54:56,401 --> 01:54:57,234
all right guys,
I guess a donate a dollar to suggest 

2711
01:54:58,501 --> 01:55:03,501
what I should draw an almost 40,000.
God don't arable here or boards could,

2712
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:08,430
I mean you could choose what I draw.
I would say 50 bucks.

2713
01:55:08,490 --> 01:55:11,520
We'll consider your suggestion.
If it's over 50 bucks.

2714
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:12,960
I mean if it's,
if it's 50 bucks,

2715
01:55:12,961 --> 01:55:13,830
I'll,
I'll do it.

2716
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:14,760
Um,
let's see.

2717
01:55:14,761 --> 01:55:16,950
Let's see what people will ask for 50 
bucks.

2718
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:19,500
The first $50 gets to,
gets to pick.

2719
01:55:21,310 --> 01:55:22,320
All right,
well we'll keep it up.

2720
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:25,440
Keep it up by the time this is a 
relatively like,

2721
01:55:25,470 --> 01:55:29,310
like this draft is pretty close to what 
ended up on screen,

2722
01:55:29,311 --> 01:55:31,890
but I know that there's change or like 
I'm seeing that there's change though.

2723
01:55:31,891 --> 01:55:34,230
I took a little lick and I'm feeling 
fine now.

2724
01:55:34,590 --> 01:55:35,700
Okay.
Now,

2725
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:36,471
by the way,
a pay.

2726
01:55:36,471 --> 01:55:39,060
A lot of people have been donating to 
joey and to write on my face.

2727
01:55:39,180 --> 01:55:40,860
We're backed up,
but we're working on it.

2728
01:55:40,861 --> 01:55:43,740
We're sending people in.
They're going to be working the faces.

2729
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:44,040
We

2730
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,840
got to,
we got to do right by you.

2731
01:55:45,910 --> 01:55:48,000
We're working on it.
Please be patient.

2732
01:55:48,001 --> 01:55:48,834
Joey,
please be patient with us and you got 

2733
01:55:51,531 --> 01:55:53,250
to,
you got a $50 donation for.

2734
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:54,143
What'd you drew?
I think,

2735
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:55,620
let me see.
Let me,

2736
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:58,200
I can scroll back down.
Whereas it,

2737
01:55:58,350 --> 01:55:59,550
Alex,
I think you're cool.

2738
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:01,170
I don't watch your show,
but I will.

2739
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:02,130
I like that.
Oh,

2740
01:56:02,131 --> 01:56:03,050
that's sweet.
I like,

2741
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:05,480
I like someone just being a fan of just 
me as a human.

2742
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:07,440
I can't,
I can't scroll up.

2743
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:10,050
It's just zipping right by.
That's kind of the sweetest thing.

2744
01:56:10,051 --> 01:56:11,380
Anyone,
anyone can really say.

2745
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,670
I have no idea what you do or what your 
value is in this world,

2746
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:16,350
but I'm a fan.
Joey,

2747
01:56:16,351 --> 01:56:19,020
why don't you give this a lik I'm 
totally fine now.

2748
01:56:19,050 --> 01:56:20,920
I just want you,
you want to look a different one,

2749
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:22,260
Mr.
I don't know.

2750
01:56:22,590 --> 01:56:23,880
You don't want to have anything to do 
with it.

2751
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:25,160
I just want to,
okay,

2752
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:27,360
get it done and over with.
Next poll y'all.

2753
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:29,370
Next poll.
I think so.

2754
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,920
The next,
the next Paul Ladies.

2755
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:32,641
Okay.
Here.

2756
01:56:32,641 --> 01:56:33,211
Look,
look,

2757
01:56:33,211 --> 01:56:34,020
look,
look.

2758
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:35,300
These are the script.

2759
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:40,430
We read out a line.
Would you like to talk a bit about this?

2760
01:56:41,390 --> 01:56:42,960
Do you want me to hold it?
No,

2761
01:56:42,961 --> 01:56:44,730
I'm just showing it.
What would you like me to do?

2762
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:45,923
Rick and Morty,
the abcs of Beth by Mike mcmann episode 

2763
01:56:50,371 --> 01:56:55,371
three Oh eight.
Well by Justin reuland and Dan harmon up

2764
01:56:56,401 --> 01:56:59,880
next original original,
uh,

2765
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:01,013
going through those and I'm noticing 
that they're a little broad more sketch 

2766
01:57:06,050 --> 01:57:10,180
and he grabbing false Terry Walls fans 
is the actual [inaudible].

2767
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:13,280
So hold on one sec.
I need to draw.

2768
01:57:13,290 --> 01:57:14,600
Those are legitimately,
no,

2769
01:57:14,610 --> 01:57:14,851
no,
no,

2770
01:57:14,851 --> 01:57:15,141
no,

2771
01:57:15,141 --> 01:57:15,511
no,

2772
01:57:15,511 --> 01:57:15,781

2773
01:57:15,781 --> 01:57:16,081

2774
01:57:16,081 --> 01:57:16,441
no,
no,

2775
01:57:16,441 --> 01:57:18,090
no,
no drawing.

2776
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:20,890
Let me draw something.
I did see someone asked me to draw.

2777
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:24,930
You guys don't want to style.
I think we should both draw ethan.

2778
01:57:24,940 --> 01:57:27,180
He was joking,
but we good.

2779
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:30,750
What our prediction is,
get in here now.

2780
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:33,210
Now,
Dan or somebody,

2781
01:57:33,570 --> 01:57:37,590
if Mitchell can say it or you,
if you have the person who,

2782
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:40,770
who donated for the writing,
we need the names.

2783
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:44,700
Go ahead and get the names or Dan can 
read them as your,

2784
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:45,600
as your,
uh,

2785
01:57:45,810 --> 01:57:48,200
writing them.
Let's go ahead and go back to you.

2786
01:57:48,201 --> 01:57:53,070
The names are,
we have Ashley Marie dbs student who may

2787
01:57:53,071 --> 01:57:54,350
or may not have asked,
uh,

2788
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:57,330
to write the whole pepper,
but we're doing it regardless.

2789
01:57:57,810 --> 01:58:01,710
And a Matt Westcott.
So you three thank you so much.

2790
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:05,430
Thank all our donation each getting 
their start right.

2791
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:06,990
And God dammit.
All right.

2792
01:58:06,991 --> 01:58:08,580
I'm taking the request to draw it,
Ethan,

2793
01:58:08,581 --> 01:58:09,960
and he was child.
I'm,

2794
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:13,160
if anybody has any suggestions about 
what that drawing should look like,

2795
01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:16,050
a donate and say some suggestions,
but uh,

2796
01:58:16,350 --> 01:58:20,220
I know what's going to have the combined
aura of the both of you to somehow,

2797
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:21,250
all right,
I'll get this out.

2798
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:22,200
Is it,
I guess I should,

2799
01:58:22,201 --> 01:58:23,340
should I draw it?
It's like an adult.

2800
01:58:23,341 --> 01:58:24,360
Like what?
It's going to turn it?

2801
01:58:24,380 --> 01:58:24,901
Yeah,
just like,

2802
01:58:24,901 --> 01:58:26,270
yeah,
cause a baby's just like,

2803
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:28,920
all right,
I can't really like dunk on a baby.

2804
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:31,290
I mean you could try it,
whatever you're like.

2805
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:32,610
Okay.
I'll do both guys.

2806
01:58:32,611 --> 01:58:34,110
Here's the next poll.
Okay.

2807
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:35,423
Here's the next poll though.
Loser of the next poll has to eat this 

2808
01:58:39,871 --> 01:58:41,800
flake.
You see that?

2809
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:43,510
Oh,
that's just a flake.

2810
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:44,673
Okay.
Eat.

2811
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:45,920
Okay.

Everybody okay?
Okay.

All right.
Yup,

2815
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:52,600
Yup.

2816
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:54,370
Justin,
I want you need to consent,

2817
01:58:54,770 --> 01:58:57,810
right?
Mitchell,

2818
01:58:57,850 --> 01:59:01,710
what are you writing?
So on his socks and his boots vibrate.

2819
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:05,710
Google vibrations did nine 11 on his 
cheek.

2820
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:06,573
Okay.
We're all familiar with that conspiracy 

2821
01:59:08,081 --> 01:59:08,914
theory.
Yeah.

2822
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:13,420
At kids on bikes.
Six on his forehead and now I'm ready to

2823
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:16,330
eat the whole pepper.
Okay.

2824
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:18,730
On his nose and other cheat.
All right,

2825
01:59:18,731 --> 01:59:20,650
thank you.
I'm beginning to look like six,

2826
01:59:20,651 --> 01:59:23,590
nine joe or Dan.
Really finish it.

2827
01:59:25,290 --> 01:59:27,160
Oh,
wait a minute.

2828
01:59:27,190 --> 01:59:29,350
Hold on a minute.
I couldn't do it.

2829
01:59:30,810 --> 01:59:35,070
Well Wayne,
I even like,

2830
01:59:35,130 --> 01:59:40,130
it's not a Michelin Star restaurant.
It's not supposedly had to rat me out.

2831
01:59:43,820 --> 01:59:45,990
Keep eating.
Yeah,

2832
01:59:46,530 --> 01:59:47,780
I just saw it.
Okay,

2833
01:59:47,781 --> 01:59:49,370
so Dan,
let's make a new poll.

2834
01:59:49,371 --> 01:59:50,660
Okay.
This is,

2835
01:59:51,110 --> 01:59:54,680
this is one flake torn.
Is this lame or is this good?

2836
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:55,880
No,
I think that's good.

2837
01:59:55,881 --> 01:59:59,330
A whole flake if just looking at made 
your whole mouth on fire for a minute.

2838
01:59:59,331 --> 02:00:00,164
I think of like as a pretty good and I 
think that you should have to like chew 

2839
02:00:02,481 --> 02:00:03,314
it and kind of enjoy the joy and 
following that likes to put it on your 

2840
02:00:07,101 --> 02:00:09,170
tongue like a drop acid.
You know what I'm saying?

2841
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,280
Oh yeah,
I know what you're saying.

2842
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:14,510
Let it do its thing.
The bottoms,

2843
02:00:14,511 --> 02:00:16,700
the worst part.
Do you know that very well?

2844
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:19,700
Yeah.
I'm just trying to figure out,

2845
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:22,430
trying to figure out how to combine your
guys' faces here.

2846
02:00:22,910 --> 02:00:25,440
Now Joey,
you are famous for put,

2847
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:26,293
you are known in the gay community.
Is that right for putting your Dick and 

2848
02:00:28,551 --> 02:00:30,190
hot dog buns and sharing pictures?

2849
02:00:30,210 --> 02:00:33,070
I've run into more gay friends than like
my youtube fans.

2850
02:00:33,290 --> 02:00:35,870
Mm hmm.
And so do you get,

2851
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:36,763
do you get a lot of gay offers for Sec?
Like are people interested and is that 

2852
02:00:40,641 --> 02:00:43,340
something you would ever consider if I 
needed to do it a full time job?

2853
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:45,320
Like selling my underwear?
Yeah.

2854
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:46,393
Or like selling photos.
I could easily have people offer to buy 

2855
02:00:49,971 --> 02:00:52,580
your underwear used or or do they prefer
it?

2856
02:00:52,581 --> 02:00:54,370
You want to use you and have you sold it
ever?

2857
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:55,243
No.
Why not considered it and I was all can 

2858
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:57,173
make a quick line.
They they ask me sometimes I'll feel 

2859
02:00:59,271 --> 02:01:01,730
like 40 50 bucks.
Is that a good price for you?

2860
02:01:02,330 --> 02:01:04,610
It doesn't cost me anything.
Just got old underwear.

2861
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:07,100
I have a lot of ripped up on the way.
That's true.

2862
02:01:07,101 --> 02:01:07,934
Huh?
Now do they want it kind of where we're 

2863
02:01:09,471 --> 02:01:11,690
at 40,000
I would make it fresh for them,

2864
02:01:11,691 --> 02:01:12,860
you know,
41,000

2865
02:01:12,861 --> 02:01:15,800
almost now what you far in it?
Would you have a streaks Jane?

2866
02:01:15,801 --> 02:01:16,634
Like what makes a good pair under what I
should do is have like a website where 

2867
02:01:19,181 --> 02:01:20,014
you buy joey's underwear.
Then you customize it by Joey's under 

2868
02:01:22,031 --> 02:01:22,864
weight gain.
Come stain s g and would you try ask 

2869
02:01:27,381 --> 02:01:28,490
cheese?
Yeah.

2870
02:01:28,491 --> 02:01:29,390
I don't know.
I'm so glad to.

2871
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:30,710
CEO is gone.
I'm sweating.

2872
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,920
He's still watching.
He's like no cash.

2873
02:01:32,930 --> 02:01:37,930
She's as she's all right Justin.
We're doing the second the the winter.

2874
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:44,720
I guess it is what it has to eat this 
flake of a Carolina reaper.

2875
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:46,130
Okay.
All right.

2876
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:51,320
I feel like this is not that 
interesting.

2877
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:52,161
No.
Yeah.

2878
02:01:52,161 --> 02:01:52,994
What are you doing that's going to cost 
some real serious damage to somebody 

2879
02:01:57,650 --> 02:02:01,160
that's not interesting.
I don't think we could do better.

2880
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:03,560
I feel like we could do better in severe
pain.

2881
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:06,300
I did that before the show for noma.
Wait,

2882
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:09,140
you ate a flake flake.
Really?

2883
02:02:09,310 --> 02:02:14,310
Okay.
Oh sorry.

2884
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:21,070
Sorry.
Um,

2885
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:22,213
I'm just going to eat this then because 
this shit is fucking boring and you're 

2886
02:02:23,751 --> 02:02:25,040
all a drawing.
I'm not doing shit,

2887
02:02:25,041 --> 02:02:26,870
so I'm going to eat this.
You know what?

2888
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:28,990
No,
I need,

2889
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:29,953
I need to see written the whole thing.
I need to see a hundred dollar donation 

2890
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:35,420
top donor replaced.
He needs,

2891
02:02:35,421 --> 02:02:38,210
someone's got to replace the top donor 
of $1,100

2892
02:02:38,690 --> 02:02:40,190
he said we'll eat that flight.

2893
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:41,990
Yeah.
Oh,

2894
02:02:41,991 --> 02:02:45,410
can you guys cut to the pool?
I want to see Joey's a kitty pool.

2895
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:48,650
Y'All need to see this sad sight cause 
y'all aren't donating enough mind.

2896
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:50,750
Show the Kiddie Pool.
Look at this.

2897
02:02:50,751 --> 02:02:51,584
That's disgusting.
That's where Joe should be laying right 

2898
02:02:54,621 --> 02:02:55,700
now.
Let's,

2899
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,280
let's,
let's kick this thing up a notch.

2900
02:02:58,600 --> 02:02:59,790
We got a car.
I got it.

2901
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:04,070
I got a full of milk's bracket to get 
into that pool and eat that next.

2902
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:05,570
Oh,
we're getting close.

2903
02:03:05,571 --> 02:03:08,150
We're at 41,000.
And what do we have to reach?

2904
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:10,850
Ghost pepper.
I'll go and I want to see,

2905
02:03:10,851 --> 02:03:13,010
just give me 100 bucks and I'll eat this
flake.

2906
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:14,143
I feel like I'm back in grade school.
Just give me five bucks and elite this 

2907
02:03:17,751 --> 02:03:21,800
hot dog and a draw their baby as posted.
Okay.

2908
02:03:21,801 --> 02:03:23,210
I got 100 bucks.
I was fat.

2909
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:26,100
I got a hundred bucks from Sephora 
young.

2910
02:03:26,850 --> 02:03:27,750
Uh,
can we,

2911
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:29,450
are we all caught up on the writing by 
the way,

2912
02:03:29,451 --> 02:03:30,284
Dan?

2913
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:31,560
I believe so.
I'll,

2914
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:32,600
uh,
I'll check back in and,

2915
02:03:32,601 --> 02:03:33,880
all right,
cheers everybody.

2916
02:03:33,881 --> 02:03:35,950
I'm eating a plague.
Nobody cares.

2917
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:37,180
Nobody cares.
But I mean,

2918
02:03:37,780 --> 02:03:40,450
I want to see what happens.
Let's see.

2919
02:03:41,230 --> 02:03:42,063
This is going to be brutal.
Or are you holding it in your mouth and 

2920
02:03:44,381 --> 02:03:45,830
you know all your thoughts?
Oh God,

2921
02:03:48,190 --> 02:03:50,480
go vote.
I growed up.

2922
02:03:51,550 --> 02:03:56,550
I regretted it for 100 bucks is worth 
more than a hundred bucks.

2923
02:03:59,450 --> 02:04:01,390
I thought we're going to do it.
If somebody replaced the top,

2924
02:04:01,450 --> 02:04:02,283
the top boat I want gave a Hyundai,
but like I'm the only one that's going 

2925
02:04:05,481 --> 02:04:10,120
to eat a carolina reaper.
This whole episode with Ed Joey Salads,

2926
02:04:10,121 --> 02:04:12,130
underwear as a reward.
We can do that.

2927
02:04:12,700 --> 02:04:14,080
Yeah.

2928
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:16,460

would embrace.

2929
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:19,450
We'll,

2930
02:04:19,451 --> 02:04:22,330
get in the pool with cause I want to,
I want to replace it anyway.

2931
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:24,970
Milky underwear.

2932
02:04:25,030 --> 02:04:26,080

2933
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:28,300

I want to know $10,000

2934
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:30,420
who exactly is going to be handled?

2935
02:04:30,490 --> 02:04:32,480
Link Shipping.
That item.

2936
02:04:35,890 --> 02:04:37,150
Okay.
This is no joke.

2937
02:04:37,170 --> 02:04:37,980
Fucked up.

2938
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:41,340
I cannot eat this for $100 I'm sorry I 
put it in my mouth.

2939
02:04:41,610 --> 02:04:42,900
My mouth is on fire.
No,

2940
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:43,743
no,
you gotta do it when somebody would top 

2941
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:46,380
the top,
the top donor.

2942
02:04:46,381 --> 02:04:48,090
That's all right.
I'm going to eat.

2943
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:48,953
I'm going to tear off a little tiny bit.
These God damn fire core off a little 

2944
02:04:54,601 --> 02:04:57,180
couple of chunks and I'm like,
God,

2945
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:00,310
I'm the only one.
Oh my God.

2946
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:02,370
Alright,
what's the next poll?

2947
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:03,930
All right.
Wait,

2948
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:06,990
I got sucked in to taste.
Got some art that I made.

2949
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:10,910
Oh,
is that you suck in your opinion.

2950
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:12,253
Yeah,
it's me.

2951
02:05:12,990 --> 02:05:16,260
It's me being in my own mountain,
so put it up.

2952
02:05:18,070 --> 02:05:20,980
Oh my God,
that's so spicy.

2953
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,380
Signed it.
I'm really afraid of shredder.

2954
02:05:22,410 --> 02:05:23,850
Getting a hold of one of these flicks.
Yeah,

2955
02:05:23,851 --> 02:05:26,070
be careful man.
I'm just keeping it all right there.

2956
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:27,840
All right.
I drew Ethan and he was baby.

2957
02:05:27,841 --> 02:05:29,040
Let me sign this.
Oh Wow.

2958
02:05:29,041 --> 02:05:31,350
It looks just like,
hey will you know it's weird.

2959
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:33,270
One of my old dogs,

2960
02:05:33,271 --> 02:05:35,340
Got You.
Don't want like dogs trueup like corners

2961
02:05:35,341 --> 02:05:37,620

They still like this spray and it's like

2962
02:05:37,621 --> 02:05:38,790
hot pepper spray.

2963
02:05:39,230 --> 02:05:40,063
Okay.

2964
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:44,690
Oh it's beautiful.
Who wants to buy this?

2965
02:05:44,900 --> 02:05:49,900
Or I can give a close close to your mom 
and that she would love that.

2966
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:53,033
This baby,

My mouth is on fire just from licking 

2970
02:06:03,091 --> 02:06:03,620
that.
Huh?

2971
02:06:03,620 --> 02:06:05,230
I ate a couple of flicks.

2972
02:06:05,420 --> 02:06:06,360
but I'm going to call her.

2973
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:08,473
That's up.

2974
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:13,070
We need a new cove.
We need a new poll.

2975
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:16,220
What's the pull for crime and Justin was
the pool.

2976
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:22,250
Um,

2977
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:23,233
all right.

2978
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:27,660
You're the creative guy.
I mean,

2979
02:06:27,661 --> 02:06:30,060
I'm trying to,
I'm like scanning for ideas here.

2980
02:06:31,110 --> 02:06:31,801
Let's see.
Anybody,

2981
02:06:31,801 --> 02:06:33,390
anybody in there.
I have a good idea for a poll.

2982
02:06:33,391 --> 02:06:36,660
What torture do you want to inject into 
our life for cash?

2983
02:06:36,661 --> 02:06:39,330
If somebody,
somebody makes a Paul.

2984
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:40,290
Wait,
wait,

2985
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:41,123
what's the poll thing?
It's like if this person has to do 

2986
02:06:42,931 --> 02:06:45,420
something,
I feel like pulls into limited.

2987
02:06:45,421 --> 02:06:50,421
I would rather say that Joey and Ethan 
will make out tongue kiss if,

2988
02:06:51,230 --> 02:06:56,230
if somebody donates $1,500
no beats the top donor.

2989
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:58,200
No,
and they've already agreed to it.

2990
02:06:59,820 --> 02:07:01,680
Ethan is actually married,
so,

2991
02:07:01,710 --> 02:07:02,450
oh,
okay.

2992
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:05,160
All right.
How about the non-married guys here?

2993
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:06,550
I'm staying out of this.
Yeah.

2994
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:07,261
You know what?
You're right.

2995
02:07:07,261 --> 02:07:08,094
That was a dumb idea.
There's five people on Tumbler who 

2996
02:07:10,051 --> 02:07:15,051
already want to see all of us making out
drawings of whatever you can imagine.

2997
02:07:15,430 --> 02:07:17,040
Um,
to see that pop up.

2998
02:07:17,050 --> 02:07:19,110
All right.
I don't know man.

2999
02:07:19,111 --> 02:07:22,320
Like should it be spicy pep shit?
This shit is real hot man.

3000
02:07:22,350 --> 02:07:23,183
Well I want to get,
we'll be careful with that shit back in 

3001
02:07:25,291 --> 02:07:27,930
cause I don't want shredder to get it.
Well if it stays up there,

3002
02:07:27,931 --> 02:07:32,931
he's not going to be a dog.
Is that the fish skin?

3003
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:37,700
Yeah,
it's fish again.

3004
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:39,860
Well I was trying to tell a story 
before.

3005
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:41,280
Oh go ahead.
So,

3006
02:07:41,870 --> 02:07:42,703
oh wow.
So know what I'm saying is they have 

3007
02:07:44,391 --> 02:07:48,050
like this pepper spray that you spray on
like woods so the dogs don't chew on it.

3008
02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:48,571
Okay.
Yeah.

3009
02:07:48,571 --> 02:07:52,420
And my dog was like impervious to it and
it,

3010
02:07:52,421 --> 02:07:53,254
it was like straight up pepper spray 
that you said it was like a wolf dog 

3011
02:07:56,480 --> 02:08:01,480
seasoning seasoning.
So she was licking at it the whole day.

3012
02:08:01,970 --> 02:08:04,130
There you go.
That's actually pretty good dude.

3013
02:08:04,390 --> 02:08:07,310
Hasten oh my goodness.
Good.

3014
02:08:08,030 --> 02:08:10,190
That's a good mixture of like two of 
you.

3015
02:08:10,191 --> 02:08:15,191
That's like a pretty incredible and can 
be,

3016
02:08:15,231 --> 02:08:16,064
which in eyes and then he got ethan 
eyebrows going to town and then like a 

3017
02:08:18,861 --> 02:08:23,861
little baby food free food started 
wearing fresh.

3018
02:08:25,310 --> 02:08:28,310
It's wearing teddy freshies repping this
fresh immediately.

3019
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:31,520
What the Frick?
That is so good.

3020
02:08:32,510 --> 02:08:33,300
Yeah,
it's cuts.

3021
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:35,330
It kind of debate.
It's kind of disturbing.

3022
02:08:35,390 --> 02:08:37,370
That's pretty good.
We're going to have to compare when your

3023
02:08:37,371 --> 02:08:38,570
baby's born,
how close it is,

3024
02:08:38,571 --> 02:08:39,680
which one of us is like.
Got It.

3025
02:08:39,681 --> 02:08:44,681
You got the drawing closest?
Oh yeah,

3026
02:08:44,990 --> 02:08:45,823
here.
Sorry.

3027
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:46,753
Yeah,
lots.

3028
02:08:47,110 --> 02:08:47,943
Lots.
Heart.

3029
02:08:48,350 --> 02:08:49,190
Okay,
listen.

3030
02:08:50,390 --> 02:08:52,220
The next,
let's just do a poll.

3031
02:08:52,430 --> 02:08:53,510
Yeah,
go ahead Scott.

3032
02:08:54,030 --> 02:08:54,863
Okay,
I'll tell you what,

3033
02:08:54,990 --> 02:08:56,670
I'll drive it.
Okay.

3034
02:08:56,730 --> 02:08:57,563
Whoever,
whoever gets the most donation on the 

3035
02:08:59,881 --> 02:09:00,714
next poll has to drive to the nearest 
blockbuster and rent a really 

3036
02:09:03,391 --> 02:09:06,480
embarrassing move.
What do you guys think?

3037
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,420
What people want to hear Justin do the 
ric voice,

3038
02:09:09,421 --> 02:09:10,380
man,
that's the thing.

3039
02:09:10,381 --> 02:09:11,820
You got to auction off,
man.

3040
02:09:12,090 --> 02:09:16,100
You Mind Justin?
You know it seems like a,

3041
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:16,973
that's not a poultry level.
Whoever gets the most money does the 

3042
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:20,813
Rick Voice.
Yeah,

3043
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:23,610
that's right.
Heel has to do.

3044
02:09:23,611 --> 02:09:24,810
Rick eat.
Didn't man.

3045
02:09:24,811 --> 02:09:25,620
Delicious.

3046
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:27,480
Okay.
It's gotta be spicy pepper thing,

3047
02:09:27,481 --> 02:09:28,560
right?
I don't know,

3048
02:09:28,590 --> 02:09:29,423
but I don't want to outdo outdo joey.
Like I'm over here eating Carolina 

3049
02:09:33,511 --> 02:09:36,010
reaper and Joey's sitting there like 
fucking on his phone.

3050
02:09:36,030 --> 02:09:36,691
Okay.
Where are we at?

3051
02:09:36,691 --> 02:09:37,524
Where are we at with the donation?
40 2042 though we are getting close to 

3052
02:09:41,431 --> 02:09:42,420
that 50 man.
Yeah,

3053
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:43,673
that's going to be entertaining.
The 50 should be like after tongue kiss 

3054
02:09:46,891 --> 02:09:50,040
for the victims.
The fuck is this.

3055
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,810
I love that.
This is our chat stream.

3056
02:09:51,811 --> 02:09:54,240
This is great.
And we pull a prank call.

3057
02:09:54,241 --> 02:09:56,190
Are we wanting to do that or is that a 
note?

3058
02:09:56,191 --> 02:09:59,460
Was there any fallout from last year's 
prank call?

3059
02:09:59,490 --> 02:10:00,470
It was all,
no,

3060
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:02,910
because that was one of the most 
incredible things I've ever seen.

3061
02:10:02,911 --> 02:10:04,440
Like you know,
it was sort of,

3062
02:10:04,470 --> 02:10:05,910
it was,
it was in good,

3063
02:10:06,090 --> 02:10:07,710
good fun.
It was all in.

3064
02:10:07,711 --> 02:10:09,990
Good Fun.
Well,

3065
02:10:09,991 --> 02:10:10,824
we should have

3066
02:10:10,950 --> 02:10:11,783
donut,
a drive where if we get a certain 

3067
02:10:13,831 --> 02:10:14,664
amount,
I love that we're on the fly trying to 

3068
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:21,150
set up a challenge for for that.
What does that mean?

3069
02:10:22,770 --> 02:10:24,330
5,000
Oh,

3070
02:10:24,331 --> 02:10:27,850
like little little challenges that fill 
the channel brand.

3071
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:29,520
Call Papa bless.

3072
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:31,691
Oh,
I don't know.

3073
02:10:31,691 --> 02:10:33,410
Like it's,
I feel like I,

3074
02:10:33,411 --> 02:10:34,040
that's,
that's,

3075
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:34,873
that's a,
that's a scary path because there's all 

3076
02:10:36,681 --> 02:10:39,110
kinds of laws and shit,
right?

3077
02:10:39,111 --> 02:10:39,944
Aren't there?
We were a little more cavalier about 

3078
02:10:41,391 --> 02:10:45,600
this last year.
I think we were just drunk or like true.

3079
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:49,130
We are all very sober right now.
Oh,

3080
02:10:49,131 --> 02:10:52,580
I'll tell you what.
I need to drink alcohol,

3081
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:54,830
you know,
let's do a thing where it's like,

3082
02:10:54,831 --> 02:10:56,510
you know,
we all have to take shots or whatever.

3083
02:10:56,511 --> 02:10:58,940
That's what was missing from this.
This is the mystery ingredient.

3084
02:10:59,150 --> 02:11:01,310
We got to give our baby fecal.
Oh,

3085
02:11:01,311 --> 02:11:03,020
I forgot about that.
Yeah,

3086
02:11:03,590 --> 02:11:05,510
he was,
he was off the table for that.

3087
02:11:05,610 --> 02:11:09,440
But the dream,
but I think I've seen Ila about as drunk

3088
02:11:09,441 --> 02:11:10,670
as well.
Maybe not,

3089
02:11:10,671 --> 02:11:13,850
but I've seen her pretty drunk and she's
like exactly the same as she is sober.

3090
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:14,820
We go,
we were just,

3091
02:11:15,110 --> 02:11:15,943
we just put,
just put three shots on the table and 

3092
02:11:19,311 --> 02:11:20,390
then we make that a challenge.

3093
02:11:20,390 --> 02:11:22,160
Whoever has the highest has to do all 
three.

3094
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:24,170
Oh God,
three shots.

3095
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:25,033
Yeah,
man,

3096
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:26,953
that'll get interesting.
I didn't say of what can we just do a 

3097
02:11:32,571 --> 02:11:35,300
spicy pepper Schatz?
I'll do it.

3098
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:37,250
I'll do it for free.
I'll do it.

3099
02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:38,720
We'll get some,
get some drinks.

3100
02:11:38,721 --> 02:11:39,410
Skype,
bathroom.

3101
02:11:39,410 --> 02:11:41,550
Be Right back.
Oh,

3102
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:42,613
if someone,
nobody drinks a glass of milk from the 

3103
02:11:44,061 --> 02:11:45,590
pool after,
after joey goes,

3104
02:11:45,830 --> 02:11:47,450
that's a good one.
Oh God.

3105
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:52,010
That shot of the little shot of very 
nasty.

3106
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:53,600
But Hey,
you know,

3107
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:56,360
if the money's there,
you know what?

3108
02:11:56,361 --> 02:11:58,340
That's the pole.
That's the pole.

3109
02:11:58,550 --> 02:11:59,510
That's the pole.
Dan,

3110
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:00,860
did you hear that?
Nope.

3111
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:03,800
What's up a poll?
The four of us,

3112
02:12:03,801 --> 02:12:06,050
same victims including Ian,
Alex,

3113
02:12:07,490 --> 02:12:09,760
myself and Justin,
the,

3114
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:10,903
the Louis Low.
We'll go in and instead of me has to 

3115
02:12:14,121 --> 02:12:17,570
take a shot of the milk from Joey's 
Katie Pool.

3116
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:21,260
Okay.
Uh,

3117
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:22,720
Ian says he's lactose intolerant.

3118
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:25,250
He's out.
That's a bullshit.

3119
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:27,700
That's bullshit.
And that's what he's saying.

3120
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:30,640
And get them,
we need to get,

3121
02:12:30,641 --> 02:12:34,970
we need to get a separate pool with 
lactaid or whatever.

3122
02:12:35,510 --> 02:12:36,343
[inaudible] you for real.
Are you for real getting out of this 

3123
02:12:38,301 --> 02:12:40,370
right now because of your lactose 
intolerance?

3124
02:12:41,450 --> 02:12:42,860
Yeah.
I should probably sit this one out.

3125
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:44,373
Come on in a shot of,
it's not going to kill my do it for the 

3126
02:12:47,331 --> 02:12:50,120
fire.
The people who it's going to be 50% shit

3127
02:12:50,130 --> 02:12:51,770
and piss.
God forbid in,

3128
02:12:51,771 --> 02:12:52,604
he could get a little taste of milk.
How about your whole house burned down 

3129
02:12:55,071 --> 02:12:56,520
and you have nothing left.
Exactly.

3130
02:12:56,530 --> 02:12:57,363
There.
There's people out there that need this 

3131
02:12:57,891 --> 02:12:59,930
money.
Put it in and the Po Ian,

3132
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:00,771
come on.
Look at it.

3133
02:13:00,771 --> 02:13:04,310
Slowly creep up.
We're getting closer and closer to 50.

3134
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:06,980
We got to get to fuck it.
We got to get all the way.

3135
02:13:06,981 --> 02:13:08,780
Meanwhile,
let's shoot the big cabinet.

3136
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:10,700
Joey,
how do we,

3137
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:13,580
how do we do this?
If someone drops a quick 10 grand,

3138
02:13:13,940 --> 02:13:16,780
we'll ship them a bottle of my urine.
I'm like,

3139
02:13:16,910 --> 02:13:17,691
God,
right now,

3140
02:13:17,691 --> 02:13:19,280
nobody's gonna donate.
Good Job Joey.

3141
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,920
If I see a $10,000
thing in there,

3142
02:13:21,921 --> 02:13:25,370
you're eating the pepper man.
Oh Man.

3143
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:27,200
Oh yeah.
So,

3144
02:13:27,290 --> 02:13:27,981
uh,
let's see.

3145
02:13:27,981 --> 02:13:29,750
I got a bunch of entertaining stuff 
here.

3146
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:30,771
Uh,
yeah,

3147
02:13:30,771 --> 02:13:31,880
let's look at some,
I thought

3148
02:13:32,170 --> 02:13:34,380
some stuff.
Hey everybody out there.

3149
02:13:34,390 --> 02:13:37,140
Got Any,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

3150
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:41,130
Anybody up there got any a ginger beer?
Not Alcoholic.

3151
02:13:41,131 --> 02:13:43,440
Just just,
just good old sodie pop.

3152
02:13:43,690 --> 02:13:46,140
I just want to split it.
I just wanted your beer in this cup.

3153
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:49,500
I wish I could drown out the wine.
Drink Ila or I should stay sober.

3154
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:52,080
What happens if he drinks?
What happens?

3155
02:13:52,290 --> 02:13:54,690
I turn into a Gremlin.
Oh,

3156
02:13:54,691 --> 02:13:56,790
like on the,
like if you turned them on a drug,

3157
02:13:56,850 --> 02:13:58,560
I'm on an antidepressant.
Oh yeah.

3158
02:13:58,561 --> 02:13:59,394
They don't drink.
Yeah,

3159
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:01,710
I really want to,
but you guys can get drunk.

3160
02:14:01,940 --> 02:14:02,773
I'm like,
what do you mean you try and do at 

3161
02:14:02,931 --> 02:14:03,764
Gremlin?
Like the mixture is like I turned in 

3162
02:14:05,581 --> 02:14:09,600
like at Lackland Gremlins.
Touch water and you start multiplying.

3163
02:14:10,050 --> 02:14:11,620
Is that what it is?
I thought they turned to evil.

3164
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:14,490
They're multiplying when they touch.
Why did they turn evil at midnight?

3165
02:14:14,670 --> 02:14:16,350
Yes.
If they've eaten before midnight.

3166
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:18,750
There's a lot of rules to that.
There's so many rules,

3167
02:14:18,751 --> 02:14:19,710
man.
Gremlins is like,

3168
02:14:19,730 --> 02:14:20,310
it's,
it's,

3169
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:21,750
it's a lot of work.
Owning your Gremlin.

3170
02:14:22,290 --> 02:14:24,330
I have got our mcguire,
I guess technically,

3171
02:14:24,331 --> 02:14:26,880
but you guys keep the donations going.
We're so close.

3172
02:14:26,881 --> 02:14:30,300
Come the F on to my face guys.
What's going?

3173
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,860
I love this podcast is just us like go 
and come on.

3174
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:34,553
I know this is not entertaining at all.
Munching on Japanese snacks in front of 

3175
02:14:38,311 --> 02:14:41,430
the microphone is a little mushroom.
I fucking awesome.

3176
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:42,630
Yeah,
they're really delicious,

3177
02:14:42,631 --> 02:14:44,760
right?
A little cookie with a mushroom.

3178
02:14:44,761 --> 02:14:48,630
And I'll tell you what,
Japan does not fuck around when it comes

3179
02:14:48,631 --> 02:14:50,550
to making snacks.
Look a board.

3180
02:14:50,551 --> 02:14:51,990
Julia is going to show her joy.
Don't,

3181
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:53,700
don't change what you're doing right 
now.

3182
02:14:54,090 --> 02:14:55,940
Just give God a shout of joy.

3183
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:02,580
He's literally,
this is so lame.

3184
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:07,080
We gotta get that pepper map.
Okay,

3185
02:15:07,081 --> 02:15:08,860
well let's talk about this three miles 
north of mold.

3186
02:15:08,861 --> 02:15:09,420
Calm.
Oh,

3187
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:11,370
here we go.
You dug this one up.

3188
02:15:11,371 --> 02:15:13,200
Only 420,000
views.

3189
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:17,880
Is that on a card?
Actually,

3190
02:15:17,881 --> 02:15:19,050
I don't know.
I don't even know what I meant.

3191
02:15:19,410 --> 02:15:21,150
The other video,
I had a thousand views you showed.

3192
02:15:21,450 --> 02:15:22,620
Yeah.
Thank you for,

3193
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:24,150
thank you for noticing.
Wait,

3194
02:15:24,180 --> 02:15:25,013
no,
what it did.

3195
02:15:25,890 --> 02:15:26,371
Oh,
the dog.

3196
02:15:26,371 --> 02:15:27,960
One dog.
We're getting held up.

3197
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:29,820
Okay.
These are amazing.

3198
02:15:29,821 --> 02:15:31,400
These are the best candy I've ever had.
Yes.

3199
02:15:31,401 --> 02:15:33,930
Salicious.
Let's talk more about this.

3200
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:35,273
I think that every burger,
which is another delicious Japanese 

3201
02:15:37,951 --> 02:15:40,230
treat candy,
I don't think I brought one.

3202
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:42,420
Very good.
Very good treat.

3203
02:15:43,230 --> 02:15:44,580
Um,
this is the worst.

3204
02:15:47,060 --> 02:15:48,090
All right,
and we're waiting for you.

3205
02:15:48,091 --> 02:15:50,750
Alex is the worst.
Just the worst.

3206
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:51,593
KIPP.
So this year people have a spiritual 

3207
02:15:56,581 --> 02:15:57,414
retreat and Norway and this guy,
oh Norway teaching them how to repel 

3208
02:16:05,250 --> 02:16:09,180
energy using their psychic power.
Oh,

3209
02:16:09,181 --> 02:16:10,920
I think I've be.
Yes.

3210
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:13,770
And so he is kind of doing a 
demonstration.

3211
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:18,630
Is this from like a larger yes thing.
Okay.

3212
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:21,830
Three miles north of,
I don't know what it's called.

3213
02:16:22,170 --> 02:16:25,150
Not here it is.
So this is the instructor?

3214
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:26,793
Yes.
Are you sure we haven't watched this 

3215
02:16:28,870 --> 02:16:30,040
touch?
Can you come magnus,

3216
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:30,873
I've seen this.
I've seen so far because she was still 

3217
02:16:33,041 --> 02:16:38,041
out here on the podcast before.
I do watch a video of you watching this.

3218
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:41,753
I'm afraid.
Can we watch videos of people just 

3219
02:16:45,431 --> 02:16:48,820
destroying convenience stores after 
this?

3220
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:53,680
After this please.
I know I've seen this before.

3221
02:16:56,520 --> 02:16:58,980
These poor people are one step away from
being in a cult.

3222
02:16:59,070 --> 02:17:01,440
What are they trying to do?
They aren't if they aren't already,

3223
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:04,380
so he's teaching them how to repel.
We needed the pole.

3224
02:17:04,650 --> 02:17:06,330
When you're standing on the,
on the,

3225
02:17:06,331 --> 02:17:08,490
on the,
on the edge of a lake doing this,

3226
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:09,353
you might need to ask,
you might be in a call doing that rugby 

3227
02:17:13,381 --> 02:17:14,214
man's,
if you're standing at the edge of a 

3228
02:17:16,021 --> 02:17:19,460
lake,
per chanted up for Jack to energy on how

3229
02:17:19,461 --> 02:17:22,390
other people by God,
God,

3230
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,780
Geez.
Oh Geez.

3231
02:17:26,230 --> 02:17:29,640
While she tries to pull it off like he's
having a seizure.

3232
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:34,140
Oh Man.
Somebody give this guy in the house.

3233
02:17:34,170 --> 02:17:37,140
What was he trying to do?
What was supposed to happen?

3234
02:17:37,330 --> 02:17:41,670
You're juggling at the,
he was going to pretend to be repelled,

3235
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:43,980
but they were goofing around and he 
tried to make a point.

3236
02:17:43,981 --> 02:17:47,430
They show how real it is because is that
blood?

3237
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:48,483
No,
that was just like her shawl or 

3238
02:17:49,171 --> 02:17:50,370
something.
Just gave her a tumble.

3239
02:17:50,550 --> 02:17:51,180
Oh,
now he's like,

3240
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:51,960
oh,
come into like,

3241
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:52,651
oh,
I just woke up.

3242
02:17:52,651 --> 02:17:53,350
What happened?
Oh,

3243
02:17:53,350 --> 02:17:54,780
the spirit.
Listen.

3244
02:17:55,650 --> 02:17:57,030
He blames it on them.
Watch.

3245
02:17:57,720 --> 02:18:00,630
Where the fuck were you guys?
Will you guys,

3246
02:18:01,150 --> 02:18:01,983
I kind of want to give this guy my life 
savings in that follow him into the 

3247
02:18:04,291 --> 02:18:07,790
woods and where would he wears?
Like a little cheese.

3248
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:09,930
He's healing or just by shaking his 
hands and,

3249
02:18:09,950 --> 02:18:11,820
no,
but that was like step aside,

3250
02:18:11,821 --> 02:18:14,970
I'm the real good rule rollover.
You idiot.

3251
02:18:16,710 --> 02:18:18,280
I just act like she was shot.
Yeah,

3252
02:18:18,281 --> 02:18:19,200
come on.
Take it easy.

3253
02:18:19,220 --> 02:18:21,040
You're like,
you're acting like somebody raining.

3254
02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:21,923
Raining.

3255
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:26,970
This is my favorite scam as being a 
faith healer who injures people and then

3256
02:18:26,971 --> 02:18:29,700
tries to heal them.
What you just did to them.

3257
02:18:29,701 --> 02:18:30,534
It's like,
I've crippled you now I'm going to make 

3258
02:18:31,441 --> 02:18:32,670
you stand like,
you know.

3259
02:18:32,671 --> 02:18:34,380
It's funny.
It's like she's kind of having to,

3260
02:18:34,590 --> 02:18:36,900
he might've broke her neck and he's like
Jocelyn,

3261
02:18:36,901 --> 02:18:39,420
her head now he knows.
He's knows what he's doing.

3262
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:43,560
Suddenly he's better really hoping this 
shit turns out to be real.

3263
02:18:44,890 --> 02:18:45,850
Well,
it's part of his scan.

3264
02:18:45,860 --> 02:18:49,290
He did it to show them is there a snake 
root that it comes all wrong.

3265
02:18:49,310 --> 02:18:53,210
Yeah.
Let's zoom in on these people.

3266
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:55,540
They're like,
I wish these people would stop coming to

3267
02:18:55,541 --> 02:18:58,870
this lake.
Just trying to have a nice weekend.

3268
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:00,820
July.
They keep ruining it.

3269
02:19:03,740 --> 02:19:04,760
Join us in the circle.

3270
02:19:06,050 --> 02:19:07,640
All right.
Can you stop a Guy?

3271
02:19:07,641 --> 02:19:09,860
Who can you feel your legs?

3272
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:12,050
All right.
Listen Lady.

3273
02:19:14,930 --> 02:19:15,763
I love it.
Huh?

3274
02:19:19,850 --> 02:19:20,683
You think youtube would have been the 
death of these types of people like 

3275
02:19:22,271 --> 02:19:23,440
that?
They wouldn't get away with it,

3276
02:19:23,441 --> 02:19:26,440
but it's just like somebody who's 
watching this right now,

3277
02:19:26,441 --> 02:19:30,860
who's super it.
I think these folks probably don't watch

3278
02:19:30,861 --> 02:19:33,670
youtube.
They probably are pretty disconnected.

3279
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:36,020
Deep emotion.
That's probably part of the whole,

3280
02:19:36,630 --> 02:19:37,463
she's quitting soon,
but she has given up that it's her 

3281
02:19:42,291 --> 02:19:43,124
fault.
She's really trying harder to not get 

3282
02:19:44,950 --> 02:19:47,720
body-slammed by this dude.
I watched this whole documentary.

3283
02:19:47,721 --> 02:19:49,770
This guy's like a enso.
It's again,

3284
02:19:49,910 --> 02:19:50,743
it's a getaway.
They come together for like three weeks 

3285
02:19:52,401 --> 02:19:55,310
every year in Norway and this guy's all 
desperate.

3286
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:56,144
What are you?
Are you going or did you sign up or 

3287
02:19:57,321 --> 02:19:59,240
you're going to go?
Those days are behind me.

3288
02:20:01,910 --> 02:20:03,950
There's a ghost in here.
Somebody let this guy out,

3289
02:20:03,951 --> 02:20:06,370
so there you have it.
I would just,

3290
02:20:06,860 --> 02:20:07,693
I just wish she was stronger.
She got injured and it's really her 

3291
02:20:09,981 --> 02:20:10,860
fault.
She's pointing.

3292
02:20:10,910 --> 02:20:12,110
Yeah.
Tell him,

3293
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:14,210
look,
you can bring in the mood down.

3294
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:17,060
She,
she bombed everyone out by,

3295
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:21,320
you know,
getting hurt when he rammed into her and

3296
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:23,210
I get it.
It's like I'd be bummed too.

3297
02:20:23,630 --> 02:20:24,463
You don't want someone shattering your 
weird culty belief system by being hurt 

3298
02:20:30,591 --> 02:20:32,420
to knocked over.
You want them to like,

3299
02:20:32,450 --> 02:20:36,680
you know,
be like a god and and float or something

3300
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:40,160
when tackled by as a fully grown,
ripped,

3301
02:20:41,330 --> 02:20:45,170
fairly repeated gentlemen.
Scientologists like when you go clear,

3302
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:47,690
you're supposed to have like perfect,
like perfect mine,

3303
02:20:47,691 --> 02:20:48,524
perfect spirit.
You could like project your mind and 

3304
02:20:50,151 --> 02:20:52,280
like your entire body's balanced,
but it's like,

3305
02:20:52,460 --> 02:20:53,293
if that's the case,
why was l Ron Hubbard have the grossest 

3306
02:20:55,060 --> 02:20:59,800
teeth in the entire world to his teeth 
looked like a right.

3307
02:21:01,510 --> 02:21:03,530
It's like right now I'm going to look 
like a gap.

3308
02:21:03,560 --> 02:21:05,790
A gap is like an like a gap in your 
teeth.

3309
02:21:05,800 --> 02:21:06,990
It was like a hot,
that's like the hot,

3310
02:21:07,360 --> 02:21:09,890
what's Madonna started doing it?
Give it some time.

3311
02:21:09,910 --> 02:21:11,210
Alan Hubbard teeth.
They're going to be,

3312
02:21:11,211 --> 02:21:12,044
that's going to be a thousand years.
It's going to look going to be a thing 

3313
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:16,970
and he's just so far ahead of training.
He was like,

3314
02:21:16,971 --> 02:21:18,860
he was like,
I want my teeth to look like this.

3315
02:21:18,890 --> 02:21:22,760
I fully believe that you could be a 
successful cult leader in a weird way.

3316
02:21:22,761 --> 02:21:23,594
You kind of are feeling like,
what do we got a better memory than 

3317
02:21:25,971 --> 02:21:28,280
mine?
We got messages from,

3318
02:21:28,910 --> 02:21:30,770
you guys can hit us up with some sound 
effects.

3319
02:21:30,771 --> 02:21:31,604
What do we have for go sick?
What are we play that message music for 

3320
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:40,750
chattoway right in front of Joe you can 
use,

3321
02:21:43,830 --> 02:21:48,800
we have a new thing that we can like so 
awesome for the pull up.

3322
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:50,390
Throw the pole up,
throw the pull up.

3323
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:51,283
Listen,
Aussie is going to come and play 

3324
02:21:52,821 --> 02:21:56,360
whatever song people want her to play 
like completely awesome.

3325
02:21:56,450 --> 02:21:57,283
So like,
so we have to figure out a way to do 

3326
02:21:58,671 --> 02:21:59,504
that.
So it's like if somebody bids or 

3327
02:22:00,231 --> 02:22:01,064
somebody donates x amount,
like the same way we're doing this with 

3328
02:22:02,991 --> 02:22:05,090
like the face stuff.
If somebody donates,

3329
02:22:05,091 --> 02:22:05,924
like whatever the price is,
then they can pick whatever song and 

3330
02:22:09,981 --> 02:22:11,210
she,
she'll go in the other room,

3331
02:22:11,420 --> 02:22:13,280
listen to it,
figure it out and come back and play it.

3332
02:22:13,580 --> 02:22:15,410
Cool.
So she'll be here in like,

3333
02:22:15,411 --> 02:22:16,760
I dunno,
a half an hour or something.

3334
02:22:16,761 --> 02:22:19,280
Should we order some pies?
You guys hungry pies?

3335
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:20,241
I don't want to eat.
No.

3336
02:22:20,241 --> 02:22:23,810
God Damn Pie.
You son of a bitch?

3337
02:22:24,060 --> 02:22:24,321
No,

3338
02:22:24,321 --> 02:22:25,730
no.

3339
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:27,080
Yeah.

3340
02:22:27,180 --> 02:22:29,100
Yeah.
I don't want to eat any meat.

3341
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:31,831
No.
Why don't we,

3342
02:22:31,831 --> 02:22:34,380
why don't we a order some pizza?
I meant get some pizza.

3343
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:38,130
Get it from Domino's and give me that 
Goddamn Hawaiian pizza.

3344
02:22:38,480 --> 02:22:41,310
Piss everyone off at some pizza and put 
up that God damn.

3345
02:22:42,040 --> 02:22:42,960
All right.
But hold on.

3346
02:22:43,150 --> 02:22:44,970
I got pizza.
We should get,

3347
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:48,540
I got to read off these donors or 
writing on Joey and by the way,

3348
02:22:48,541 --> 02:22:49,374
$100 to write on Joey too little money 
because they started coming in way too 

3349
02:22:53,071 --> 02:22:54,600

Cool,

You did have a big a deal with adult 

3360
02:23:19,301 --> 02:23:20,410
swim.
Where's that?

3361
02:23:20,411 --> 02:23:24,700
$2.
Finally,

3362
02:23:24,730 --> 02:23:28,810
finally able to Justin Smiley donate it 
finally came through.

3363
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:33,900
Finally able to find a spot for,
is it room on the floor?

3364
02:23:33,931 --> 02:23:35,890
We'd go in the neck.
The pole.

3365
02:23:35,891 --> 02:23:38,620
Dan Is uh,
is Ian not in it?

3366
02:23:38,621 --> 02:23:40,200
Is He really not in it?
Dan,

3367
02:23:40,210 --> 02:23:41,410
would you be in it?
What?

3368
02:23:41,411 --> 02:23:42,244
Pool?
Sure.

3369
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:44,170
Dan.
Alex,

3370
02:23:44,171 --> 02:23:45,970
meet Justin.
What's the pole?

3371
02:23:46,030 --> 02:23:49,270
The loser or a winner takes a shot of 
the,

3372
02:23:49,510 --> 02:23:50,620
of the milk.
Water.

3373
02:23:51,010 --> 02:23:52,330
Well,
I'm lactose intolerant.

3374
02:23:55,030 --> 02:23:57,070
That's the pole.
Throw it up for Christ's sake.

3375
02:23:57,600 --> 02:23:59,410
No,
I'll take a sip.

3376
02:23:59,411 --> 02:24:02,260
I'll do a sip at most.
So if you vote for me,

3377
02:24:02,410 --> 02:24:05,050
get ready to be fucking disappointed.
No,

3378
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:07,750
it's a shot as one measurable.
No guys,

3379
02:24:07,751 --> 02:24:10,600
it's 40th.
Oh wait.

3380
02:24:10,610 --> 02:24:15,610
I'll tell you someone get Justin Viagara
my mic and me to,

3381
02:24:19,450 --> 02:24:21,130
um,
the uh,

3382
02:24:21,220 --> 02:24:23,080
I was going to say like,
I think that the,

3383
02:24:23,081 --> 02:24:24,820
I think that if we're going to drink it,
if,

3384
02:24:24,830 --> 02:24:26,770
if,
if we're going to put up a poll,

3385
02:24:27,010 --> 02:24:27,843
let this be a pull that runs in the 
background all the way till the end of 

3386
02:24:29,921 --> 02:24:30,430
the fucking thing.

3387
02:24:30,430 --> 02:24:33,100
Because this should,
this should also,

3388
02:24:33,101 --> 02:24:34,360
by the way,
if the pole,

3389
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:35,713
um,
collectively doesn't raise pass a 

3390
02:24:37,931 --> 02:24:39,160
certain amount,
we're all,

3391
02:24:39,161 --> 02:24:42,160
we need to get a,
we're off the hook because if it's like,

3392
02:24:42,190 --> 02:24:43,540
oh,
we raised $2,000.

3393
02:24:43,541 --> 02:24:46,000
Now if someone has to take a shot of 
fucking joey milk,

3394
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:47,753
like I'm not going to be like,
what are they doing that I wouldn't do 

3395
02:24:50,141 --> 02:24:55,141
that if somebody gave me $2,000.
It's gotta be like the plus.

3396
02:24:58,060 --> 02:25:00,610
There's nothing even gross about the 
joey milk.

3397
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:01,593
We can get the pinning.
This guy's going to be sitting at an 

3398
02:25:03,341 --> 02:25:04,174
even sad it,
he hasn't eaten anything more than a 

3399
02:25:05,441 --> 02:25:07,990
Jalapeno for Christ's sake.
I mean,

3400
02:25:07,991 --> 02:25:12,640
he flew up from New York,
I believe.

3401
02:25:12,641 --> 02:25:14,170
Anyways.
You know what?

3402
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:16,360
Let,
let me see if I can't do some stuff.

3403
02:25:16,390 --> 02:25:17,860
I'm on.
Oh,

3404
02:25:17,861 --> 02:25:20,140
hey aussies almost here.
Pull though.

3405
02:25:20,340 --> 02:25:22,800
Maybe the polos up.
Meet her at the stairs.

3406
02:25:22,801 --> 02:25:24,120
Holes a office

3407
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:25,130
here.
If someone can meet her daughter.

3408
02:25:25,250 --> 02:25:26,980
She's almost here.
The poll is up.

3409
02:25:27,250 --> 02:25:29,740
Who takes a shot of Joey Salads?
Pool milk.

3410
02:25:29,830 --> 02:25:32,050
Oof.
No.

3411
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:33,630
One more.
Let me see.

3412
02:25:33,870 --> 02:25:35,140
Uh,
who can I,

3413
02:25:35,320 --> 02:25:36,470
how do I get this?
This,

3414
02:25:37,060 --> 02:25:40,570
how do I get this stream more widely 
distributed so we can get some more?

3415
02:25:40,571 --> 02:25:42,400
Uh,
yeah,

3416
02:25:42,401 --> 02:25:43,234
we should do a second round.
And the promotion got these 

3417
02:25:45,041 --> 02:25:48,340
motherfuckers out.
There it is.

3418
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:50,110
He loves original article.
Kanya I get it.

3419
02:25:50,111 --> 02:25:52,300
Get it gets a retweet.
He'd say Ilan,

3420
02:25:52,780 --> 02:25:56,230
Mikaila connected.
Has He launched a submarine over here?

3421
02:25:56,920 --> 02:25:59,560
Either of those people,
Ilan and say,

3422
02:25:59,561 --> 02:26:02,650
Yo,
I know you're probably free right now.

3423
02:26:03,400 --> 02:26:06,910
Not a busy guy.
Christ.

3424
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:09,080
[inaudible]

3425
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:10,690
when we get some drinks in here,
hey,

3426
02:26:10,691 --> 02:26:12,460
what's the,
what's the drink's going on?

3427
02:26:12,490 --> 02:26:13,323
Get some,
uh,

3428
02:26:13,850 --> 02:26:16,450
it was whispering the word drinks into 
the microphone.

3429
02:26:16,451 --> 02:26:18,820
Opening drinks magically appear.
Kid.

3430
02:26:18,821 --> 02:26:21,120
Somebody out there bringing in much 
rank.

3431
02:26:21,310 --> 02:26:22,840
I already got.
I just went and made my own.

3432
02:26:22,841 --> 02:26:23,860
I was like,
I got,

3433
02:26:23,910 --> 02:26:25,300
I need a drink.
Um,

3434
02:26:25,330 --> 02:26:27,430
what's the,
what's the link to the podcast guys?

3435
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:32,470
Whoever just donate a dollar and post 
chat with the link to the,

3436
02:26:32,950 --> 02:26:34,540
what is it?
It's youtube.

3437
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:36,040
Did we have the president,
uh,

3438
02:26:36,041 --> 02:26:38,080
doing an interview or what?
Oh,

3439
02:26:38,081 --> 02:26:38,470
is,
is,

3440
02:26:38,470 --> 02:26:39,303
is,
is President Donald Trump going to be 

3441
02:26:41,441 --> 02:26:44,800
president of the United States yourself?
So many questions for president trump.

3442
02:26:44,980 --> 02:26:46,150
If he's,
if he's,

3443
02:26:46,151 --> 02:26:48,190
uh,
we need a pizza when he drinks,

3444
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:49,113
we need a president.
Get the Hawaiian a ultimate from 

3445
02:26:52,781 --> 02:26:57,700
dominoes or whatever it's called.
So it's youtube.com/slash

3446
02:26:57,810 --> 02:26:58,643
hv podcast.
You've told me that like four days on 

3447
02:27:01,601 --> 02:27:03,690
twitter,
but there's a directly to cast,

3448
02:27:04,060 --> 02:27:05,140
right?
Yeah.

3449
02:27:05,740 --> 02:27:06,910
Okay,
so hold on.

3450
02:27:07,180 --> 02:27:08,830
Okay,
we got surprises throughout.

3451
02:27:09,070 --> 02:27:11,740
Let's watch some more stuff.
Some stuff.

3452
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:14,140
Here we go.
Oh,

3453
02:27:14,141 --> 02:27:16,540
did you guys know that Carlton is suing 
fortnight?

3454
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:17,860
No,
I think that's a joke.

3455
02:27:17,890 --> 02:27:18,611
No,
it's real.

3456
02:27:18,611 --> 02:27:20,980
It's from the guardian.com.
Carlton,

3457
02:27:20,981 --> 02:27:21,814
I'm telling you.
What do you guys think about this fresh 

3458
02:27:24,791 --> 02:27:28,940
prince actor soon for using as iconic 
Carlton Day?

3459
02:27:28,941 --> 02:27:31,060
I liked the guy,
you know,

3460
02:27:31,061 --> 02:27:32,200
I mean I think,
I think he's,

3461
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:33,280
I think he's great.

3462
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:34,433
It is his stance.
But when does he expect the to get to 

3463
02:27:36,630 --> 02:27:37,230
here you go

3464
02:27:37,230 --> 02:27:38,610
watch the similarity.

3465
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:45,080
It is slow.
It's a straight up ripped off.

3466
02:27:45,740 --> 02:27:47,740
Carl though.
Is that

3467
02:27:48,780 --> 02:27:49,613
fallen?
So the interesting question about this 

3468
02:27:52,370 --> 02:27:54,650
and they're not just ripping off well 
known dances.

3469
02:27:54,651 --> 02:27:59,150
There's little people who have invented 
dances and dumb them very brilliantly at

3470
02:27:59,151 --> 02:28:04,151
fortnight is frame for frame stealing 
their dances and now we're at,

3471
02:28:05,150 --> 02:28:10,150
we're at like 45 k and then fort night 
is stealing their dances.

3472
02:28:10,730 --> 02:28:14,510
Like frame for frame and getting famous.
People are buying these dances.

3473
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:15,373
Yeah.
By making money off these people 

3474
02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:19,010
property.
Yes.

3475
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:22,100
They're making of money

3476
02:28:22,370 --> 02:28:23,203
and they're not credited.
When's the last time you heard a legal 

3477
02:28:25,041 --> 02:28:27,800
case like you did my dance,
but it's a,

3478
02:28:27,801 --> 02:28:31,010
it's a new,
it's an area.

3479
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:33,670
I think it's a brave new world.
That's what,

3480
02:28:33,720 --> 02:28:35,000
well here's,
here's,

3481
02:28:35,270 --> 02:28:37,590
here's the issue with that because if,
let's just say he,

3482
02:28:37,820 --> 02:28:39,500
I don't think he has any legal case for 
that,

3483
02:28:39,501 --> 02:28:43,930
but let's say he wins at that point.
What stops him from copywriting,

3484
02:28:43,931 --> 02:28:45,980
all the videos of people doing the 
debts.

3485
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:47,833
You know what I mean?
Between somebody who's monetize buckle 

3486
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:57,520
and end just asking for like millions.
No,

3487
02:28:57,640 --> 02:28:58,473
really,
you know what,

3488
02:28:58,490 --> 02:29:03,270
here's why this is happening and I don't
want to say about this.

3489
02:29:03,610 --> 02:29:04,443
This is a bit,
this is a bit of a different probably 

3490
02:29:06,381 --> 02:29:08,540
thing than what you were expecting to 
hear.

3491
02:29:08,541 --> 02:29:10,640
That was a horribly constructed 
sentence.

3492
02:29:10,641 --> 02:29:12,420
But um,
I,

3493
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:13,221
this is,
this is,

3494
02:29:13,221 --> 02:29:14,054
this is proof that actors and people in 
the entertainment industry are not as 

3495
02:29:18,351 --> 02:29:19,280
rich as you think they are.

3496
02:29:19,310 --> 02:29:20,143
Number one,
like you're telling me this guide and 

3497
02:29:22,041 --> 02:29:24,110
dancing with the stars isn't as rich as 
I think.

3498
02:29:24,140 --> 02:29:24,591
Well,
no,

3499
02:29:24,591 --> 02:29:25,424
I'm just saying like everyone,
like you see a guy on a couple of 

3500
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:29,240
sitcoms and you're like,
oh man,

3501
02:29:29,241 --> 02:29:32,300
I can't even imagine what kind of 
mansion that person lives in.

3502
02:29:32,750 --> 02:29:36,020
And the reality is you get paid sag 
scale.

3503
02:29:36,021 --> 02:29:37,620
I'm sure that,
um,

3504
02:29:37,700 --> 02:29:39,470
what is the actor's name that played 
Carlton?

3505
02:29:39,471 --> 02:29:41,600
I don't want to keep calling him Carlton
and I feel like that's,

3506
02:29:41,660 --> 02:29:44,530
what's his name?
Shit I know is on it.

3507
02:29:44,710 --> 02:29:45,411
You know,
it's funny,

3508
02:29:45,411 --> 02:29:50,411
even in his party phones Alphonso he,
I know it from a,

3509
02:29:50,690 --> 02:29:54,020
that that food show on,
because even in this guardian article,

3510
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:57,470
they refer to him as the Prince French 
French actor.

3511
02:29:57,650 --> 02:29:59,840
His name is Alfonzo.
Okay.

3512
02:29:59,860 --> 02:30:00,201
Yeah.
Yeah.

3513
02:30:00,201 --> 02:30:01,700
So Alfonso,
it's like,

3514
02:30:01,701 --> 02:30:02,534
you know,
he probably made a good chunk of money 

3515
02:30:03,621 --> 02:30:07,440
and some residuals off of fresh prince 
and he's them host.

3516
02:30:07,490 --> 02:30:08,091
No,
he did.

3517
02:30:08,091 --> 02:30:10,580
I mean,
he made a decent amount for sure.

3518
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,550
And then I've seen him host a couple of 
other shows and he's great.

3519
02:30:13,730 --> 02:30:14,780
He's funny,
like,

3520
02:30:14,781 --> 02:30:15,614
you know,
but that's just like the fact that he 

3521
02:30:17,731 --> 02:30:20,270
sees,
well,

3522
02:30:20,271 --> 02:30:21,120
first of all,
he probably,

3523
02:30:21,710 --> 02:30:23,840
he probably believes he's completely in 
the right.

3524
02:30:23,870 --> 02:30:25,430
I mean it's,
it's pretty much dead on.

3525
02:30:25,431 --> 02:30:30,140
It's exactly what they referenced.
This video.

3526
02:30:30,141 --> 02:30:31,560
Yeah.
That literally do it.

3527
02:30:31,820 --> 02:30:33,410
So,
yeah,

3528
02:30:33,411 --> 02:30:34,640
I mean,
I get it.

3529
02:30:34,641 --> 02:30:35,930
It's like,
I totally get it,

3530
02:30:35,931 --> 02:30:36,770
but it's like,
you know,

3531
02:30:36,771 --> 02:30:39,860
if he was just flush with money,
he wouldn't give a shit.

3532
02:30:39,861 --> 02:30:40,221
He'd be like,
yeah,

3533
02:30:40,221 --> 02:30:41,054
I don't give a shit.
But because fortnights taking billion a 

3534
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:44,750
billion dollars a minute and it makes 
sense.

3535
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:45,703
Right.
Because if this guy who's not that well 

3536
02:30:48,111 --> 02:30:49,040
off,
it's like,

3537
02:30:49,070 --> 02:30:49,641
oh,
these guys,

3538
02:30:49,641 --> 02:30:52,370
by the way,
I'm just jumping to the assault.

3539
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:56,930
I think most people in the entertainment
industry who are actors,

3540
02:30:57,320 --> 02:30:59,030
they're not as rich as people think.

3541
02:30:59,030 --> 02:30:59,863
They are.
Definitely.

3542
02:31:00,170 --> 02:31:01,340
Particularly because the acting 
acting's,

3543
02:31:01,460 --> 02:31:02,293
it's not a nine to five where you clock 
in every single day after your Gig is 

3544
02:31:04,911 --> 02:31:05,744
over.
You're hustling,

3545
02:31:05,810 --> 02:31:07,400
CIG,
so between jobs,

3546
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:09,020
you know,
if you're not getting residuals,

3547
02:31:09,021 --> 02:31:10,040
you're literally not kidding.
Hey,

3548
02:31:10,041 --> 02:31:13,220
and by the way,
a lot of times you're paid per episode,

3549
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:16,820
so we're working a whole year and going 
in every day,

3550
02:31:16,821 --> 02:31:20,310
but you're only getting paid for each 
episode and each and every season,

3551
02:31:20,450 --> 02:31:22,080
depending on how many episodes are in a 
season,

3552
02:31:22,081 --> 02:31:23,940
it's like the tree are not really making
that much.

3553
02:31:24,210 --> 02:31:28,380
Very small amount of people in 
entertainment are actually rich.

3554
02:31:28,950 --> 02:31:29,341
I,
you know,

3555
02:31:29,341 --> 02:31:32,640
it's so funny because I used to pull,
you'll see on mainstream shows,

3556
02:31:32,700 --> 02:31:33,533
actors that you see on huge shows on 
television are probably not even 

3557
02:31:37,411 --> 02:31:38,191
millionaires.
No,

3558
02:31:38,191 --> 02:31:40,710
not anymore.
Not even in the 90s.

3559
02:31:40,711 --> 02:31:45,000
It was like this big explosion of like 
there was money in them there hills,

3560
02:31:45,001 --> 02:31:46,320
but now it's like,
no,

3561
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:48,450
and I used to think like,
oh man,

3562
02:31:48,451 --> 02:31:49,470
that's where the money's at.

3563
02:31:49,980 --> 02:31:51,390
Uh,
and it's like,

3564
02:31:51,391 --> 02:31:52,224
yeah,
I mean I feel like I'm more informed 

3565
02:31:53,041 --> 02:31:54,180
now.
I'm like,

3566
02:31:54,181 --> 02:31:54,511
wow.
Yeah,

3567
02:31:54,511 --> 02:31:58,590
there's not that much money and why he's
not splitting the pizza.

3568
02:31:58,640 --> 02:32:03,640
That's [inaudible] I saw you got two 
bucks.

3569
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:08,113
I know,
but I,

3570
02:32:08,670 --> 02:32:11,220
I have to tell you,
where did you get them sharpies at?

3571
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:12,440
Sorry,
go ahead.

3572
02:32:12,440 --> 02:32:13,590
At the first,
you know,

3573
02:32:13,591 --> 02:32:16,110
at first I was saw that and I was like,
oh great.

3574
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:16,973
You know,
that's ridiculous and silly that they 

3575
02:32:19,921 --> 02:32:24,120
actually steal like frame for frame.
Like it's not based on him.

3576
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:26,580
It is him.
I didn't know they sell,

3577
02:32:26,581 --> 02:32:28,070
did dance.
They sell it.

3578
02:32:28,230 --> 02:32:29,410
That's the thing.
I it,

3579
02:32:30,530 --> 02:32:34,880
I don't [inaudible] you,
you play for night dial.

3580
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:37,380
They sell the dances.
They saw the dances.

3581
02:32:37,381 --> 02:32:40,760
But I don't know if some of them are for
sale.

3582
02:32:40,761 --> 02:32:44,220
Some of them you want lock.
Would this change if it was an unlock or

3583
02:32:44,221 --> 02:32:46,620
a free like right out of the gate does 
in my opinion.

3584
02:32:46,620 --> 02:32:50,070
But it change.
It can change and anyone back there find

3585
02:32:50,071 --> 02:32:52,530
out early,
they could easily get a royalty.

3586
02:32:52,531 --> 02:32:55,850
So it's like,
I call this court to honor.

3587
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:56,901
Tell me,
do this.

3588
02:32:56,901 --> 02:32:58,670
No questions.
What's the car?

3589
02:33:00,450 --> 02:33:03,830
No,
was it unlockable?

3590
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:04,853
Oh,
it was available from the beginning of 

3591
02:33:07,981 --> 02:33:08,814
the game.
It was such like a beautiful family 

3592
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:11,573
disordered imagining that then you end 
to court by saying course the court 

3593
02:33:15,241 --> 02:33:18,300
disorder,
but like to imagine anybody in a sort of

3594
02:33:18,301 --> 02:33:20,400
legal authority and shit about 
technology.

3595
02:33:21,080 --> 02:33:26,080
That was the night I've heard.
Oh nine he did read it and dogpile.

3596
02:33:29,911 --> 02:33:30,744
Dot.
So it looks like I'm going to be drink 

3597
02:33:32,430 --> 02:33:33,263
pile would be so your worst nightmare 
come true and it looks like I'll be 

3598
02:33:36,001 --> 02:33:37,360
taking a shot at Joey's.
No,

3599
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:39,620
no,
no.

3600
02:33:39,690 --> 02:33:41,280
This is what,
this is what I'm going to say.

3601
02:33:41,790 --> 02:33:45,210
If the collective total is not more than
10 grand,

3602
02:33:45,211 --> 02:33:46,044
it's not happening.

3603
02:33:46,050 --> 02:33:47,820
Right.
So get outta here.

3604
02:33:48,060 --> 02:33:50,100
Everyone who already donated,
I apologize.

3605
02:33:51,140 --> 02:33:52,230
It's like,
you know,

3606
02:33:52,700 --> 02:33:57,700
you gotta you go to 7,000
so close to 40.

3607
02:33:59,220 --> 02:34:02,700
How about how I'm giving another 
thousand so wait,

3608
02:34:02,701 --> 02:34:06,300
when we get to 50 is only going to eat 
the yeah,

3609
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:06,720
the,
the,

3610
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:10,050
the not even that.
I think we got to change the rules.

3611
02:34:10,150 --> 02:34:12,240
We can't choose the rules.
We listened.

3612
02:34:12,390 --> 02:34:15,570
We did.
We not happening.

3613
02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:16,823
I think we're going to go take it easy.
I wanted to say something about Alfonso 

3614
02:34:20,831 --> 02:34:22,610
in this thing.
Um,

3615
02:34:23,230 --> 02:34:24,063
Dan,
I don't need another thousand 3000 for 

3616
02:34:26,270 --> 02:34:27,880
anyone to see.
Just to wrap this up.

3617
02:34:27,881 --> 02:34:29,930
Donate it on the,
on the baby Joe,

3618
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:30,970
which will drawing.
Do I want,

3619
02:34:30,971 --> 02:34:32,330
I'm going to bid on it.
Fuck.

3620
02:34:33,330 --> 02:34:35,160
So hold on real quick.
I want the xbox.

3621
02:34:35,161 --> 02:34:36,010
Dan Put it.
I'm kidding.

3622
02:34:36,190 --> 02:34:37,023
Just donate $1,000
because I'm freaking tired of this shit 

3623
02:34:40,270 --> 02:34:40,720
real quick.

3624
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:41,553
I can I just say thank you Dan.
I noticed something and I'm so out of 

3625
02:34:45,161 --> 02:34:47,260
the loop on this shit,
but somehow I saw this and I didn't know

3626
02:34:47,261 --> 02:34:49,480
what the fuck it was referring to.
So thank you.

3627
02:34:49,510 --> 02:34:51,910
Now I know the origins,
the welcome,

3628
02:34:51,911 --> 02:34:56,860
but I saw a thing where he admits to 
borrowing that dance from someone else.

3629
02:34:57,020 --> 02:34:59,140
Oh,
anyone caught up on this?

3630
02:34:59,141 --> 02:35:00,400
You want to pull this one up?
Cause like,

3631
02:35:00,401 --> 02:35:02,530
well I'd rather you can use everything.
Well yeah,

3632
02:35:03,790 --> 02:35:05,890
because this is the dance that they 
stole.

3633
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:08,590
Well it depends if you went well.
Yeah,

3634
02:35:08,591 --> 02:35:09,640
no you're right.
That's lit.

3635
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:12,670
You know what I mean?
So the questions I have is,

3636
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:18,120
was the dance inspired by someone else's
dad fired by something?

3637
02:35:18,671 --> 02:35:22,570
Know what I the only question,
literally the only question that matters

3638
02:35:22,571 --> 02:35:24,940
to me right now and you guys in back 
should be able to help.

3639
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:30,430
What's this?
What's this sole lawyer or a judge?

3640
02:35:30,930 --> 02:35:32,830
I think if,
if it does go to Cortland,

3641
02:35:32,831 --> 02:35:35,260
say he wins,
I think it opens up the door for like so

3642
02:35:35,261 --> 02:35:40,261
much bad things with copyrights because 
it's similar.

3643
02:35:42,011 --> 02:35:43,570
That wasn't my identical,
right.

3644
02:35:43,571 --> 02:35:46,300
They could made it similar and I think 
there's more to the dance.

3645
02:35:46,301 --> 02:35:47,134
They could have like given him a royal.
I think there's more to the dance 

3646
02:35:49,061 --> 02:35:49,894
though.

3647
02:35:51,830 --> 02:35:52,510
No,
you there?

3648
02:35:52,510 --> 02:35:56,560
I think it goes beyond grab seconds.
At a sink with them.

3649
02:35:56,950 --> 02:35:57,670
Yeah,
look it up.

3650
02:35:57,670 --> 02:36:00,190
There's a longer one that that shows 
more because if,

3651
02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:04,090
if you can copyright dance moves,
how far back?

3652
02:36:04,970 --> 02:36:06,940
Why,
why is her dancing in this game?

3653
02:36:07,090 --> 02:36:09,130
What's the game?
I've never played 49.

3654
02:36:09,131 --> 02:36:09,964
My Life Justice.
If you played fortnight from everything 

3655
02:36:12,011 --> 02:36:13,550
I've heard about it,
it's got nothing to give.

3656
02:36:15,490 --> 02:36:18,670
I feel like I shouldn't because my 
partner,

3657
02:36:18,830 --> 02:36:20,470
uh,
basketball,

3658
02:36:20,480 --> 02:36:24,650
go watch games was executive producer of
fortnights so I should,

3659
02:36:24,740 --> 02:36:28,360
that's gotta be awkward that you haven't
played a lot of it.

3660
02:36:28,570 --> 02:36:29,403
I just,
I haven't had a lot of time to play 

3661
02:36:30,341 --> 02:36:31,870
games lately.
I'm making a game.

3662
02:36:31,930 --> 02:36:33,150
Look at this guy.
Um,

3663
02:36:33,430 --> 02:36:36,820
I'm writing to TV or the NBA Two K as 
well.

3664
02:36:39,690 --> 02:36:40,240
You know,
I,

3665
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:41,073
you know,
listen,

3666
02:36:41,170 --> 02:36:42,003
I don't know where I'm at on this.
Like you've gone all the way around and 

3667
02:36:45,130 --> 02:36:47,100
look,
this doesn't look that good at,

3668
02:36:47,110 --> 02:36:48,460
it's hard to decide.
I don't know.

3669
02:36:48,820 --> 02:36:49,181
Well,
no,

3670
02:36:49,181 --> 02:36:51,070
they changed.
They definitely energized it.

3671
02:36:51,730 --> 02:36:53,290
That one's identical.
Identical,

3672
02:36:53,291 --> 02:36:54,740
but that's for fortnight again.
But the,

3673
02:36:54,741 --> 02:36:55,161
the,
the,

3674
02:36:55,161 --> 02:36:57,160
the NBA of those guys ever mine.
Okay.

3675
02:36:57,220 --> 02:36:58,170
Whatever.
We've,

3676
02:36:58,171 --> 02:36:58,711
we've,
we,

3677
02:36:58,711 --> 02:37:00,610
we,
who are we to say,

3678
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:01,473
listen,
I say,

3679
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:04,270
I say defer to Joe on this one.
Yeah.

3680
02:37:04,271 --> 02:37:05,104
Joey,
what do you think?

3681
02:37:05,650 --> 02:37:06,483
Let them have the money on in favor.
I don't think he's going to let the guy 

3682
02:37:08,411 --> 02:37:10,450
have the money.
49,000

3683
02:37:10,930 --> 02:37:12,490
did you donate a thousand for me?
Damn,

3684
02:37:12,580 --> 02:37:13,480
I sure did.
Thank you.

3685
02:37:14,020 --> 02:37:16,060
That's why it jumps up.
We're so

3686
02:37:16,060 --> 02:37:18,620
close.
We're creeping and crawling.

3687
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:22,700
What are people saying?
We're creeping and crawling on this.

3688
02:37:23,330 --> 02:37:25,450
Papa bless.
Appreciate you guys.

3689
02:37:25,451 --> 02:37:27,830
25 pop pup.
Pudi bluffs.

3690
02:37:29,230 --> 02:37:30,610
I mean it's rolling in.
We got,

3691
02:37:38,740 --> 02:37:39,573
he said what else you got on the docket?
I feel like that that's entertaining 

3692
02:37:41,781 --> 02:37:42,590
stuff.
I feel like,

3693
02:37:42,590 --> 02:37:43,423
Hey,
yeah,

3694
02:37:44,270 --> 02:37:45,103
let's keep watching.
So I've keep looking at and having and 

3695
02:37:47,031 --> 02:37:49,250
talking about entertaining.
Would you like to watch it later?

3696
02:37:49,251 --> 02:37:50,910
That drinks on pit,
would I?

3697
02:37:52,950 --> 02:37:56,420
We have a pie on the way.
We have many pies.

3698
02:37:57,800 --> 02:38:00,230
Hawaiian for Justin,
half Hawaiian guys.

3699
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:01,700
Oh wait,
I want it all Hawaiian.

3700
02:38:01,790 --> 02:38:02,623
Ooh.
So apparently this poll is not doing 

3701
02:38:06,831 --> 02:38:07,664
shit for anybody because I'm going to 
have to drink his pissed and I get a 

3702
02:38:11,691 --> 02:38:15,260
string of that.
So let's watch a lady drink on pit.

3703
02:38:15,770 --> 02:38:17,300
Grabbed a little,
rip it.

3704
02:38:18,320 --> 02:38:19,940
Well,
I need more leverage in that.

3705
02:38:19,970 --> 02:38:21,440
There you go.
Come on.

3706
02:38:22,040 --> 02:38:23,840
Come on.
You got this Justin.

3707
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:26,000
Where do you get this?
Every time I go,

3708
02:38:26,010 --> 02:38:26,843
Gosh,
and talk to you as a weird Christian 

3709
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:30,140
candies,

3710
02:38:30,140 --> 02:38:33,130
go to a Japanese store.
Okay.

3711
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:38,680
Any Japanese store understands candy.
They understand cartoons.

3712
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:40,333
They understand things that are 
appealing and [inaudible] and strange 

3713
02:38:42,411 --> 02:38:43,430
and novel.
You know what else?

3714
02:38:43,431 --> 02:38:44,264
They understand the art of the dopamine 
hit when you're opening a blind box 

3715
02:38:48,381 --> 02:38:49,310
item.
Oh yeah,

3716
02:38:49,311 --> 02:38:50,144
they,
they do the best blind bond doing that 

3717
02:38:51,051 --> 02:38:51,711
forever.
Well,

3718
02:38:51,711 --> 02:38:52,544
before we even were like,
but we were dabbling in blind box items 

3719
02:38:55,730 --> 02:38:57,670
50 years after.
They're like,

3720
02:38:57,980 --> 02:38:59,420
it's so funny.
And then,

3721
02:38:59,421 --> 02:39:01,400
and then there's these lol surprise 
toys.

3722
02:39:01,401 --> 02:39:05,120
Anyone know about these lol?
They're 90% garbage and 10% toy,

3723
02:39:05,570 --> 02:39:06,380
but it's all,
it's,

3724
02:39:06,380 --> 02:39:07,250
it's all like

3725
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:10,090
perfect ratio.
Yo,

3726
02:39:10,130 --> 02:39:11,310
do you guys want to watch your lady 
drinker?

3727
02:39:11,320 --> 02:39:12,290
I'm pissed.
Yeah,

3728
02:39:12,291 --> 02:39:13,124
I mean,
why not?

3729
02:39:13,820 --> 02:39:15,650
When in Rome or here?
I mean,

3730
02:39:16,990 --> 02:39:17,823
well,
if you want to watch the lady drink you 

3731
02:39:18,681 --> 02:39:20,240
a Piss,
y'all better fucking donate.

3732
02:39:21,270 --> 02:39:22,101
Oh,
we're close.

3733
02:39:22,101 --> 02:39:23,300
We're close.
We're close.

3734
02:39:24,470 --> 02:39:26,840
Somebody kicked in.
Somebody can,

3735
02:39:26,860 --> 02:39:30,230
cannot believe James Wiener is still our
top donor.

3736
02:39:30,231 --> 02:39:32,600
I should have donated over more.
So I get the spot.

3737
02:39:33,110 --> 02:39:34,030
James Wine,
Huh?

3738
02:39:34,270 --> 02:39:35,060
Yeah,
yeah,

3739
02:39:35,060 --> 02:39:36,150
yeah.
Be Cool.

3740
02:39:36,230 --> 02:39:37,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

3741
02:39:37,131 --> 02:39:38,850
Whatever.
He is our top down.

3742
02:39:38,950 --> 02:39:40,220
Yeah.
I guess I should be more

3743
02:39:42,230 --> 02:39:44,130
and actually he's donated,
uh,

3744
02:39:44,300 --> 02:39:48,250
several other times for a bunch of the 
items in like $500 blocks.

3745
02:39:48,251 --> 02:39:49,084
So I think he,
he's kicked in probably three or four 

3746
02:39:50,271 --> 02:39:51,790
grand at this point.
So that guy's a hero.

3747
02:39:55,790 --> 02:39:56,670
Yeah.
All right.

3748
02:39:56,671 --> 02:39:59,310
Let's watch a lady drink her own test.
And by the time this is done,

3749
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:00,353
I fricking better see that be a 50 k and
then hopefully that's entertaining 

3750
02:40:04,441 --> 02:40:07,840
enough that we go up to 75 get Mr 
Beeston.

3751
02:40:08,790 --> 02:40:13,000
Where's the,
where's miss?

3752
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:14,100
Should be eating it.
Yeah.

3753
02:40:14,190 --> 02:40:15,023
Meet them.
But it's so delicious that you can't 

3754
02:40:16,621 --> 02:40:17,380
stop eating it.
Yeah.

3755
02:40:17,380 --> 02:40:21,030
Got The resistance of gum,
but it doesn't chew like so crazy.

3756
02:40:21,031 --> 02:40:21,990
Right.
How are you loving that Isla?

3757
02:40:21,991 --> 02:40:24,810
I love it.
It's kind of like the plastic.

3758
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:25,793
That was my first reaction and then,
and then started growing and then I was 

3759
02:40:28,471 --> 02:40:28,831
like,
you know what?

3760
02:40:28,831 --> 02:40:30,000
I don't give a guy.
I love it.

3761
02:40:30,001 --> 02:40:31,780
I don't care.
I love the texture.

3762
02:40:31,810 --> 02:40:35,020
Getting your system.
I was supposed to tap your buddies.

3763
02:40:36,360 --> 02:40:39,000
It's like you found a tiny,
you started eating like a plastic candy.

3764
02:40:39,220 --> 02:40:40,053
You,
Oh,

3765
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:41,513
you're still training for the fight 
because I didn't know what was 

3766
02:40:45,121 --> 02:40:45,954
happening.
One more drawing here for the granite 

3767
02:40:47,101 --> 02:40:48,370
falls.
Vantage is a cute little mabel.

3768
02:40:48,380 --> 02:40:49,380
She's sitting there.
He's going black.

3769
02:40:49,480 --> 02:40:50,313
It could be yours,
wouldn't her and putting her in the 

3770
02:40:52,021 --> 02:40:55,000
pile.
Everything.

3771
02:40:55,170 --> 02:40:56,940
She's seen,
the horrors that she's heard.

3772
02:40:56,941 --> 02:41:00,090
Original art.
Are you freaking kidding me?

3773
02:41:00,270 --> 02:41:01,920
Oh wait,
let me finish one last part of that.

3774
02:41:02,660 --> 02:41:03,290
Yeah.
Call.

3775
02:41:03,290 --> 02:41:05,940
I'm going to call it that mountain and 
then it's done under the bathroom.

3776
02:41:05,970 --> 02:41:07,470
Hopefully when I get back.
Yeah,

3777
02:41:07,471 --> 02:41:11,120
we're a 500 away,
so someone in the comments and Ian going

3778
02:41:11,121 --> 02:41:13,920
to date wouldn't mean whoa.

3779
02:41:14,560 --> 02:41:16,570
Sticking to that for a sec,
buddy in on the mic.

3780
02:41:16,690 --> 02:41:17,523
Ian,
are you still

3781
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:19,110
dating that girl?
Are you single?

3782
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:23,370
I'm dating right now.
You offer a day.

3783
02:41:23,960 --> 02:41:27,390
Now he's uh,
he's taken about charity then.

3784
02:41:27,391 --> 02:41:29,790
Are you seeing somebody,
uh,

3785
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:30,840
nobody.
Seriously?

3786
02:41:31,390 --> 02:41:33,390
Would you be willing to go?
What do you mean nobody?

3787
02:41:33,391 --> 02:41:35,070
Seriously.
That's what he means.

3788
02:41:35,880 --> 02:41:36,713
Really well listening right now.
I can't touch him because I've got 

3789
02:41:41,250 --> 02:41:42,260
pepper hands.
Yeah.

3790
02:41:42,540 --> 02:41:44,420
So Dan,
can we raffle you off for a day?

3791
02:41:44,430 --> 02:41:46,410
You're doing this for,
I don't know about that.

3792
02:41:46,710 --> 02:41:50,120
We're trying to raise money for the,
the cow,

3793
02:41:50,150 --> 02:41:52,350

Oh,

3794
02:41:52,351 --> 02:41:57,351
somebody donated $500 for that.
Thank you.

3795
02:41:57,540 --> 02:41:58,530
Good job.
Right?

3796
02:42:03,970 --> 02:42:07,240
Finally hit me with the music.
Come on.

3797
02:42:08,940 --> 02:42:10,900
Yay.
Kelly's not even here for three,

3798
02:42:11,530 --> 02:42:14,080
but this is going to be,

3799
02:42:15,770 --> 02:42:16,420
All right.
All right.

3800
02:42:16,420 --> 02:42:18,730

3804
02:42:24,831 --> 02:42:25,301

If,

3806
02:42:27,930 --> 02:42:28,590
if,
if,

3807
02:42:28,590 --> 02:42:29,423
if basically for 200 bucks they can pick
any song and Aussie has to learn it and 

3808
02:42:33,201 --> 02:42:34,160
come in and pull it in,

3809
02:42:35,420 --> 02:42:36,950

02:42:37,060 --> 02:42:40,560
Yeah.
Got me Addicted to just fuck any song.

3811
02:42:40,561 --> 02:42:41,840
Just more in it and play it.
I'll,

3812
02:42:41,841 --> 02:42:43,360
I'll see if I can figure out a way to do
that.

3813
02:42:44,990 --> 02:42:47,240
However you have it set up for us.
Writing Shit on.

3814
02:42:49,250 --> 02:42:50,570
First of all,
everybody,

3815
02:42:50,571 --> 02:42:52,530
we're at 50,000
then a round of applause.

3816
02:42:52,920 --> 02:42:53,753
Thank you.
Oh dollars is a lot of money going 

3817
02:42:56,811 --> 02:42:57,644
straight to direct relief.
That's straight to jody buddies tuning 

3818
02:43:00,741 --> 02:43:02,750
in right now.
What's the,

3819
02:43:02,751 --> 02:43:03,530
uh,

3820
02:43:03,530 --> 02:43:04,910
what's the next?
Don't get thanked.

3821
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:07,760
The route should make him skip one,
two,

3822
02:43:07,761 --> 02:43:09,680
the spicier.
I don't know.

3823
02:43:09,681 --> 02:43:10,401
Do you think,
I mean,

3824
02:43:10,401 --> 02:43:12,010
I guess he's not here.
He might not know

3825
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:12,843
which one would give up,
but once a fresh ones dry all of the 

3826
02:43:16,181 --> 02:43:18,220
other two.
So this is the Carolina reaper.

3827
02:43:18,221 --> 02:43:21,220
This is the shit that I had a nibble of 
and fucking lost my mind.

3828
02:43:21,550 --> 02:43:24,310
So what's a reaper?
So,

3829
02:43:24,550 --> 02:43:26,120
oh,
they're both Carolina reapers.

3830
02:43:26,121 --> 02:43:29,650
So what's up next for him then?
So up next would be the ghost chili.

3831
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:31,211
No,
no,

3832
02:43:31,211 --> 02:43:31,721
no.
He's,

3833
02:43:31,721 --> 02:43:34,360
he's going to eat a whole hobby nero.
Yeah,

3834
02:43:34,960 --> 02:43:35,793
that's 75 is when we get into that.
The Ghost Chili [inaudible] 75 I just 

3835
02:43:40,041 --> 02:43:42,220
will fuck him up.
[inaudible] 75 wishes.

3836
02:43:42,270 --> 02:43:43,260
Cute.
They habit an hour.

3837
02:43:43,880 --> 02:43:45,040
We can't,
should we?

3838
02:43:45,270 --> 02:43:46,103
I feel like,
I feel like I say we'd go to the hard 

3839
02:43:49,241 --> 02:43:50,074
shit.
I'm ready to go for as long as it may 

3840
02:43:53,241 --> 02:43:54,031
too.
And the,

3841
02:43:54,031 --> 02:43:56,440
and I'll tell you what,
I've donated a $3,000

3842
02:43:56,441 --> 02:44:00,680
I'm willing to put down more down a big 
get.

3843
02:44:03,070 --> 02:44:06,190
We've already been live three hours.
We've been live three hours.

3844
02:44:06,191 --> 02:44:07,990
Well last year we did five,
right?

3845
02:44:08,380 --> 02:44:09,570
So I think,
yeah,

3846
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:10,570
that's true.
That by the way,

3847
02:44:10,571 --> 02:44:13,180
by the way,
I'm sick and pregnant.

3848
02:44:16,010 --> 02:44:19,450
Let me remind everybody,
even though we raised 240 last year,

3849
02:44:19,570 --> 02:44:22,450
I believe we only raised 100,000
during the lights.

3850
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:25,120
That's absolutely right.
A quick hit.

3851
02:44:25,121 --> 02:44:25,954
100 okay.
Because I remember we kind of had the 

3852
02:44:28,481 --> 02:44:29,314
same fatigue last year and I remember 
like I was drunk and sober and I was 

3853
02:44:33,461 --> 02:44:38,461
like taking a nap.
Like you hang over your outside for five

3854
02:44:38,801 --> 02:44:41,260
hours and there was,
there was,

3855
02:44:41,530 --> 02:44:43,530
and we only raised 100,000
sorry,

3856
02:44:44,720 --> 02:44:49,110
some alcohol fucking rally for the Fire 
Vic.

3857
02:44:49,390 --> 02:44:52,310
We can just get to 75 let's do it for 
first.

3858
02:44:52,311 --> 02:44:56,500
A fire.
Big fucking rules for those guys.

3859
02:44:57,700 --> 02:44:59,870
So guys,
we're almost a 51.

3860
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:01,533
Hold it up for 1000 Justin,
we'll do the Carlton and then he'll get 

3861
02:45:03,731 --> 02:45:04,940
sued for 4 million.

3862
02:45:07,010 --> 02:45:08,230
I can't answer it.
I'm sorry.

3863
02:45:08,860 --> 02:45:10,420
Answer it and tell them,
hey,

3864
02:45:11,290 --> 02:45:13,090
share the link.
Dan.

3865
02:45:13,091 --> 02:45:13,924
How many people,
how many people are watching this shit 

3866
02:45:15,190 --> 02:45:17,870
show?
22 k last time they're hitting.

3867
02:45:18,150 --> 02:45:21,520
They're consistent.
They're watching.

3868
02:45:21,940 --> 02:45:22,773
It's a beautiful design.
I just want to say there is a $500 

3869
02:45:30,010 --> 02:45:33,390
donation from somebody.
I think you guys know a Dana terrorist.

3870
02:45:36,390 --> 02:45:38,800
A terrorist.
Legging.

3871
02:45:39,780 --> 02:45:40,613
None.
Did she suggest something to be drawn 

3872
02:45:43,631 --> 02:45:44,464
on?
Ethan's face?

3873
02:45:45,400 --> 02:45:47,190
Let's see.
What did she actually donate for?

3874
02:45:47,230 --> 02:45:48,970
Uh,
she's donating for,

3875
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:50,140
Ooh,
she wants to what?

3876
02:45:50,190 --> 02:45:52,230
The Teddy fresh criss cross sweater 
protocol.

3877
02:45:54,170 --> 02:45:58,600
Hope she went once and she did send a 
message that just wanted to say love you

3878
02:45:58,601 --> 02:46:00,400
guys.
All caps with a whole bunch of hearts,

3879
02:46:00,401 --> 02:46:02,200
so we love you too,
Dana.

3880
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:06,130
Thank you for your donation.
By the way.

3881
02:46:06,131 --> 02:46:06,964
I saw someone donated 500.
Was that to write on me or just a 

3882
02:46:08,501 --> 02:46:09,830
sweetheart?
Is that just for

3883
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:13,690
a couple of lower ethan?
I just pulled up the,

3884
02:46:13,691 --> 02:46:14,524
uh,
the spreadsheet with the most recent 

3885
02:46:15,441 --> 02:46:16,161
donation.
So yeah,

3886
02:46:16,161 --> 02:46:17,360
we'll,
we'll come in and write on you

3887
02:46:19,050 --> 02:46:21,330
fresh stuff.
It's here in the box.

3888
02:46:21,440 --> 02:46:22,860
Oh,
by the way,

3889
02:46:22,861 --> 02:46:26,520
we're up to 51.
You guys keep it fucking go and strong.

3890
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:28,140
Joey's back

3891
02:46:29,180 --> 02:46:30,890
time.
It's time.

3892
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:31,940
It's happening.
Oh,

3893
02:46:32,210 --> 02:46:33,043
his face.
It looks like a bottle of Dr Bronner's 

3894
02:46:35,361 --> 02:46:36,320
soap.
Joey,

3895
02:46:36,850 --> 02:46:41,450
what you're going,
you're going in the pool?

3896
02:46:42,970 --> 02:46:47,970
Yeah,
dollars all the way out here.

3897
02:46:49,440 --> 02:46:50,930
Okay.
Okay.

3898
02:46:51,540 --> 02:46:54,770
All right.
I'm trying to find it new then.

3899
02:46:55,850 --> 02:46:57,860
Which one do you think going to be like 
another couple hours?

3900
02:46:57,861 --> 02:46:58,970
No,
come on,

3901
02:46:58,971 --> 02:46:59,804
Joey.

3902
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:04,490
People gave $50,000.
You see this?

3903
02:47:05,060 --> 02:47:06,110
All right.
Make it happen.

3904
02:47:06,630 --> 02:47:10,730
It happen.
51 I like how it this kind of event like

3905
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:11,633
it.
It shows like our deepest kindness and 

3906
02:47:13,131 --> 02:47:13,964
are like deepest cruelty.
The same time it's been only exist in 

3907
02:47:16,911 --> 02:47:17,744
equal and opposite proportion bid.
How do you bid to draw some shit on 

3908
02:47:22,370 --> 02:47:27,370
somebody and Sunday rewarding the list.
It's just mixed into this muddle

3909
02:47:28,510 --> 02:47:31,660
like 50,000
like yes.

3910
02:47:32,540 --> 02:47:33,373
I love a stream where it's people 
watching us try to figure out how to 

3911
02:47:35,301 --> 02:47:36,134
donate like driving a dollar though.
I can do I have some feeds on that 

3912
02:47:39,481 --> 02:47:40,590
question.
Hey,

3913
02:47:41,650 --> 02:47:45,410
welcome to the $50,000
milestone.

3914
02:47:45,411 --> 02:47:46,244
I'm your host Ethan Klein.
Today we have a scuba Santa's about to 

3915
02:47:52,221 --> 02:47:56,270
enter the pool of milk.
How are you feeling right now joey?

3916
02:47:56,271 --> 02:47:57,380
They won't be able to hear you.
My Cup.

3917
02:47:57,381 --> 02:48:00,170
My cord is actually caught.
Can Zach you help me out there?

3918
02:48:00,470 --> 02:48:01,790
Thank you so much.
God bless.

3919
02:48:03,080 --> 02:48:08,080
This is like a really bad like a news 
broadcast on cable network right now.

3920
02:48:09,681 --> 02:48:10,514
Joey,
we have a a snorkel and goggles for you 

3921
02:48:12,771 --> 02:48:15,680
to put on as well.
I do think this is going to be the first

3922
02:48:15,681 --> 02:48:19,070
spice.
He won 50 k we need another 25,000

3923
02:48:19,071 --> 02:48:19,904
to get to the,
uh,

3924
02:48:20,410 --> 02:48:22,510
the chair not wearing shoes.

3925
02:48:26,910 --> 02:48:28,020
Excellent.
Joey,

3926
02:48:28,021 --> 02:48:29,700
how are you feeling?
Disgusting.

3927
02:48:31,110 --> 02:48:33,150
Can you walk on over to me so he could 
talk in the mic?

3928
02:48:34,410 --> 02:48:38,040
You fucking sloshing through that milk 
is such a great site.

3929
02:48:38,780 --> 02:48:39,590
Ready to,
uh,

3930
02:48:39,590 --> 02:48:42,990
to accept your challenge.
You want me to insert it for you?

3931
02:48:44,010 --> 02:48:44,880
Okay.
Wow.

3932
02:48:44,910 --> 02:48:47,280
Dan is way too excited about you.
Please do this.

3933
02:48:50,580 --> 02:48:53,220
This is a fairly spicy,
I don't know.

3934
02:48:53,221 --> 02:48:56,310
It's a hobby narrow.
So it's about as spicy as you could find

3935
02:48:56,311 --> 02:48:59,350
in route.
So let's say it's from route.

3936
02:48:59,370 --> 02:49:04,370
So how bad can it be?
All right.

3937
02:49:04,470 --> 02:49:07,550
Well,
so you want me to take just an hour,

3938
02:49:07,551 --> 02:49:09,000
move the stem and you pop it all in 
there?

3939
02:49:09,150 --> 02:49:09,983
Yeah,
there you go.

3940
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:12,120
Can you discarded that so it doesn't get
it?

3941
02:49:12,420 --> 02:49:14,130
Okay.
Bon appetit.

3942
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:16,860
So this is for charity.
Joey,

3943
02:49:16,861 --> 02:49:19,230
this is a for a good cause.
You're a sweet man.

3944
02:49:19,800 --> 02:49:21,630
$50,000
is a lot of money.

3945
02:49:21,670 --> 02:49:22,503
How are you,
how do you feel about raising that much 

3946
02:49:23,311 --> 02:49:28,311
money as it taste tastes pretty good.
Oh,

3947
02:49:31,460 --> 02:49:35,400
got a really well,
hold on.

3948
02:49:35,401 --> 02:49:36,234
Hang on.
Hang on.

3949
02:49:37,050 --> 02:49:39,810
I thought that one would be spicy.
This is disappointing.

3950
02:49:41,650 --> 02:49:43,480
You can't get it out.

3951
02:49:47,100 --> 02:49:49,860
Would you eat another one?
Joey kept grabbing another one.

3952
02:49:49,870 --> 02:49:53,520
He's the fact that even considered it.
Grab it.

3953
02:49:53,670 --> 02:49:57,330
Grab it.
Because guys,

3954
02:49:57,370 --> 02:49:58,203
we,
we uh,

3955
02:49:58,570 --> 02:50:01,980
how much money have we raised you inside
here?

3956
02:50:01,981 --> 02:50:03,820
It's a small one.
All right.

3957
02:50:03,830 --> 02:50:08,830
He say he's so high milk.
Can you just grab him a jug of milk from

3958
02:50:17,781 --> 02:50:19,020
the,
from the carton.

3959
02:50:20,430 --> 02:50:21,650
My stomach hurts.
Verse Cement.

3960
02:50:21,651 --> 02:50:26,651
Now that's a bad sign shredder be if you
have to Puke,

3961
02:50:29,041 --> 02:50:31,680
puke in the pool.
No,

3962
02:50:31,710 --> 02:50:34,290
that,
that if it gets $10,000

3963
02:50:34,291 --> 02:50:35,124
we will.
But if you puke in that will make it a 

3964
02:50:36,871 --> 02:50:38,220
lot more interesting,
that's for sure.

3965
02:50:38,590 --> 02:50:40,540
All right,
good.

3966
02:50:48,160 --> 02:50:50,760
Then that poll that someone has to take 
a shot that,

3967
02:50:50,770 --> 02:50:54,060
that that's got to get like way higher 
than no.

3968
02:50:54,061 --> 02:50:58,220
If he pukes 10 I mean at least 10,000
the way up all the way up.

3969
02:50:58,500 --> 02:51:00,420
Oh.
Oh well.

3970
02:51:00,421 --> 02:51:01,141
Okay.
Well,

3971
02:51:01,141 --> 02:51:02,430
careful.
Keep it in the pool.

3972
02:51:03,270 --> 02:51:04,990
Keep it in the pool.
Tready shredding.

3973
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:08,310
Shredding.
Oh my stomach.

3974
02:51:09,840 --> 02:51:12,360
My mouth like 50% better.
But My,

3975
02:51:12,600 --> 02:51:13,840
if you'd,
if you do Puke,

3976
02:51:13,880 --> 02:51:14,713
please keep it in the cool because I 
don't want to shredder her to get spicy 

3977
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:20,190
vomit.
I don't think I'm going to Puke,

3978
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:21,450
but it's like there,
it's like,

3979
02:51:21,900 --> 02:51:25,140
it's pretty close.
Well I won't blame you.

3980
02:51:26,370 --> 02:51:27,930
Oh Zach,
stop laughing at Joey.

3981
02:51:28,230 --> 02:51:33,230
Zach.
I told him Joey and as the spicy salad,

3982
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:40,970
if you have to Puke,
if you have to Puke,

3983
02:51:40,980 --> 02:51:45,030
just if you need to sit down.
You all right.

3984
02:51:45,060 --> 02:51:47,730
Are you in pain?
He's your stomach hurting.

3985
02:51:48,870 --> 02:51:49,710
You.
Okay.

3986
02:51:55,710 --> 02:51:57,390
Go ahead and Puke it out.
It will make it all,

3987
02:51:57,700 --> 02:52:02,520
I mean like the pre,
pre.

3988
02:52:03,330 --> 02:52:06,200
Is your mouth salivating?
Oh No,

3989
02:52:11,010 --> 02:52:12,900
no.
Shit.

3990
02:52:13,210 --> 02:52:14,290
I mean,
I think so.

3991
02:52:19,210 --> 02:52:24,210
Uh,
should I say that joke again?

3992
02:52:26,410 --> 02:52:27,720
Okay.
We here too.

3993
02:52:28,190 --> 02:52:29,023
All right,
well I have,

3994
02:52:29,080 --> 02:52:31,090
if there's any updates we can switch on 
over.

3995
02:52:31,720 --> 02:52:32,710
You want to chair?
You can,

3996
02:52:32,711 --> 02:52:35,260
we can get you a chair.
You can just keep your feet soak in.

3997
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:41,160
Well go ahead and do it in the pool.
Jelly shitting in the pool.

3998
02:52:45,640 --> 02:52:47,470
Actually,
if you want to shit in the poor,

3999
02:52:47,471 --> 02:52:49,640
just don't show it.
But I'm down for a minute.

4000
02:52:49,650 --> 02:52:54,650
Shit in Nepal.
Zach,

4001
02:52:55,750 --> 02:53:00,750
what do you think should Joe Shit and 
the poor joey if you need to shit.

4002
02:53:02,470 --> 02:53:07,470
Justin and Alex,
if he needs get him some toilet paper.

4003
02:53:08,940 --> 02:53:10,660
Dan,
this is in your show.

4004
02:53:12,970 --> 02:53:17,970
You can shit in the poor justin.
A fee shuts you down if he shoots in the

4005
02:53:21,630 --> 02:53:26,630
pool.
No,

4006
02:53:27,611 --> 02:53:30,460
but forget about drinking it like he's 
going to shit in the pool.

4007
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:34,320
Wouldn't youtube shut us?
Wouldn't,

4008
02:53:34,470 --> 02:53:37,810
wouldn't youtube like shut this thing 
down immediately?

4009
02:53:38,860 --> 02:53:40,840
I would say Tom.
I would say don't,

4010
02:53:40,841 --> 02:53:43,300
don't you don't.
Why don't you instead of in the poll,

4011
02:53:43,301 --> 02:53:47,470
give them a little bucket.
Make sure that there's no skin showing.

4012
02:53:48,010 --> 02:53:53,010
I'm sure there's some line between,
I wasn't,

4013
02:53:54,791 --> 02:53:55,624
I didn't want to show it coming out,
but I just wanted him to shit and the 

4014
02:53:57,791 --> 02:53:58,391
pool.
We won't.

4015
02:53:58,391 --> 02:54:00,610
We definitely wouldn't show it.
Joey,

4016
02:54:00,870 --> 02:54:02,890
show the poop phoning around.
I think so.

4017
02:54:02,891 --> 02:54:05,860
Why not?
I think we can.

4018
02:54:05,861 --> 02:54:07,780
Sure.
Yeah.

4019
02:54:07,781 --> 02:54:10,840
We could show the poop floating around.
No,

4020
02:54:10,841 --> 02:54:11,710
no.
Hold on.

4021
02:54:11,711 --> 02:54:15,250
Let's take a poor Dan,
Justin and Alex.

4022
02:54:15,251 --> 02:54:16,150
Come here,
please say,

4023
02:54:16,151 --> 02:54:17,830
and everybody.
No,

4024
02:54:17,831 --> 02:54:22,831
but it's so good for content.
He what?

4025
02:54:25,451 --> 02:54:28,740
We know.
Okay.

4026
02:54:28,750 --> 02:54:31,630
Some sanity.
Alright.

4027
02:54:31,690 --> 02:54:34,090
Well Joey.
Okay.

4028
02:54:34,110 --> 02:54:37,080
All right.
No,

4029
02:54:37,150 --> 02:54:37,960
no,
that's,

4030
02:54:37,960 --> 02:54:39,100
that's a horrible,
okay.

4031
02:54:39,160 --> 02:54:41,900
Alright.
Well Joey depth.

4032
02:54:41,901 --> 02:54:44,320
Pooping is an as a no go.
If you have to Puke,

4033
02:54:44,321 --> 02:54:46,420
go ahead and do it.
How are you feeling right now?

4034
02:54:46,810 --> 02:54:49,150
My mouth is perfectly fine.
It's the fucking stomach.

4035
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:55,000
You were pepto Bismol,
pepto Bismol I think so.

4036
02:54:55,630 --> 02:54:56,950
Broken.
Look at shredder.

4037
02:54:57,540 --> 02:55:01,180
Shredder.
He wants to help.

4038
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:04,120
Oh,
he shut her your way to

4039
02:55:04,120 --> 02:55:05,080
kill it.
Okay.

4040
02:55:06,620 --> 02:55:07,640
All right.
Well Joey,

4041
02:55:07,660 --> 02:55:12,660
it keeps you get a shot of his feet.
Where'd Ya are his underwear?

4042
02:55:13,520 --> 02:55:14,200
His,
his,

4043
02:55:14,200 --> 02:55:15,580
uh,
milk silk.

4044
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:18,253
Hold on.
This is milk soaped underwear up for 

4045
02:55:19,820 --> 02:55:20,653
donating.
Oh,

4046
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:21,620
well.
Oh,

4047
02:55:21,621 --> 02:55:23,750
well we weren't kidding about that.
Where are we?

4048
02:55:26,220 --> 02:55:26,870
Well,
he's,

4049
02:55:26,870 --> 02:55:28,760
you probably farted in her underwear at 
least.

4050
02:55:28,761 --> 02:55:30,230
And that's valuable.
Yeah.

4051
02:55:31,210 --> 02:55:32,510
Alright.
[inaudible] careful.

4052
02:55:33,020 --> 02:55:33,920
All right,
let's go back.

4053
02:55:33,921 --> 02:55:35,000
Enjoy yourselves.
Joey,

4054
02:55:35,001 --> 02:55:36,170
you,
there's towels.

4055
02:55:36,171 --> 02:55:38,750
If you feeling better,
you can go ahead and,

4056
02:55:40,430 --> 02:55:41,263
okay,
good.

4057
02:55:41,720 --> 02:55:42,480
Well that was,

4058
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:43,313
I'm the house.
If that is an incentive to get to that 

4059
02:55:44,981 --> 02:55:47,240
next milestone,
I don't know what it is.

4060
02:55:53,160 --> 02:55:55,930
This is making me feel that way.
Then go ahead and try that again.

4061
02:55:57,390 --> 02:55:58,223
Don't touch the money.

4062
02:55:58,730 --> 02:56:00,140
What,
what is wrong on my hands?

4063
02:56:00,141 --> 02:56:02,540
I didn't touch anything.
Number one rule.

4064
02:56:02,541 --> 02:56:04,190
Don't give up the mind.
Okay,

4065
02:56:04,340 --> 02:56:05,730
so the ghost,
I'll,

4066
02:56:06,030 --> 02:56:08,330
I'll 99.9%.
I will vomit.

4067
02:56:08,750 --> 02:56:09,583
The reaper might actually kill me.
Like I'm actually concerned that like 

4068
02:56:12,531 --> 02:56:14,900
I'm just going to be eating it and I'm 
just going to like fade out.

4069
02:56:14,960 --> 02:56:18,290
Well there you have it.
Get those donations rolling in.

4070
02:56:18,800 --> 02:56:20,210
We got to hit these deadlines.

4071
02:56:21,690 --> 02:56:23,540
Alrighty.
Well I'm having fun.

4072
02:56:23,600 --> 02:56:24,433
We have more,
uh,

4073
02:56:24,440 --> 02:56:25,970
face riding.
We've got more videos.

4074
02:56:25,971 --> 02:56:29,720
We've got more content on the way.
Joey is looking like a sad,

4075
02:56:29,750 --> 02:56:30,583
tattooed Santa Claus.
He should have stayed in New York is 

4076
02:56:35,991 --> 02:56:38,600
what he said.
So there's a towel right behind you.

4077
02:56:38,730 --> 02:56:40,780
You feel free to join us.
Um,

4078
02:56:40,970 --> 02:56:42,800
how's everybody doing back here?
Everything's good.

4079
02:56:43,050 --> 02:56:45,800
Uh,
we should get Aussie set up in the,

4080
02:56:46,580 --> 02:56:47,413
okay,
cool.

4081
02:56:47,450 --> 02:56:48,870
Cool.
All right.

4082
02:56:48,940 --> 02:56:50,420
Your kidneys hurt.
He says,

4083
02:56:51,030 --> 02:56:52,340
all right,
let's continue where we were.

4084
02:56:52,460 --> 02:56:54,590
Congratulations everyone on the second 
milestone.

4085
02:56:54,591 --> 02:56:55,424
That was thrilling and very exciting.
So I'll put this back and see you guys 

4086
02:56:58,191 --> 02:57:03,191
back in the room.
The shitting in the,

4087
02:57:07,620 --> 02:57:08,080
uh,

4088
02:57:08,080 --> 02:57:10,240
there's a line,
there's a line.

4089
02:57:12,150 --> 02:57:12,983
It wasn't unclear.
Note to me exactly why not having 

4090
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:20,080
shitting in the,
have some bread,

4091
02:57:20,140 --> 02:57:23,590
not show it live.
Do people want this?

4092
02:57:25,320 --> 02:57:26,153
Definitely.

4093
02:57:27,080 --> 02:57:29,930
Um,
Nixon was innocent.

4094
02:57:30,500 --> 02:57:34,230
Um,
I love it.

4095
02:57:34,800 --> 02:57:35,633
Uh,
his feet and the milk was just 

4096
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:38,033
hilarious.
I was going to donate money and so I'm 

4097
02:57:40,321 --> 02:57:45,180
going to save that for therapy just to,
just to process what I've seen today.

4098
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:47,033
Now,
um,

4099
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:48,833
did you say we're going to have a call 
from the president of the United States 

4100
02:57:50,470 --> 02:57:52,150
herself?
Uh,

4101
02:57:52,520 --> 02:57:53,720
yes.
That was cute.

4102
02:57:53,721 --> 02:57:55,800
Up on the line.
I feel like I want to,

4103
02:57:55,801 --> 02:57:57,900
I feel like I want Justin to pick the 
president's brain.

4104
02:57:57,930 --> 02:57:59,040
I Dunno.
I don't know about you.

4105
02:57:59,190 --> 02:58:02,100
I definitely want that.
And we have that lined up.

4106
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:03,353
There's something about that shot out 
there in the back office that's 

4107
02:58:05,191 --> 02:58:07,450
hilarious.
Every time with the handheld mind.

4108
02:58:08,290 --> 02:58:09,780
Um,
it's exciting.

4109
02:58:10,170 --> 02:58:11,370
It's thrilling,
isn't it?

4110
02:58:12,060 --> 02:58:12,893
Dynamic one would even say,
I want to show really quick all the 

4111
02:58:15,511 --> 02:58:16,344
teddy fresh stuff that you could get the
sharp hoe bucket hat we were gonna make 

4112
02:58:21,811 --> 02:58:22,980
it with the sharp.
I look,

4113
02:58:22,981 --> 02:58:23,814
but we were like,
I don't know how many people will buy 

4114
02:58:25,921 --> 02:58:26,754
it.
Yeah.

4115
02:58:26,790 --> 02:58:30,290
Too Much Sherpa.
And we've got this bucket hot.

4116
02:58:30,400 --> 02:58:34,500
What's adorable,
cute little teddy bears.

4117
02:58:35,330 --> 02:58:36,163
The delightful,
I'm still taste that reaper fanny's to 

4118
02:58:40,891 --> 02:58:44,250
match your clone blocks.
We never made those.

4119
02:58:44,260 --> 02:58:47,040
Nevermind does.
Those are cool.

4120
02:58:47,220 --> 02:58:50,220
I think people would like those new 
callers though.

4121
02:58:50,221 --> 02:58:52,380
We never made that hat.

4122
02:58:55,980 --> 02:58:58,470
This is all super rare.
One of a kind.

4123
02:58:58,471 --> 02:58:59,304
Really.
This is also us trying to renew the 

4124
02:59:02,551 --> 02:59:03,384
logo.
Make it a little cleaner than the old 

4125
02:59:05,671 --> 02:59:06,504
one.
We haven't decided if we like it better 

4126
02:59:08,581 --> 02:59:12,480
or not,
but you can see our process.

4127
02:59:13,500 --> 02:59:16,980
I can't believe how many prizes you guys
lined up and sanity,

4128
02:59:16,981 --> 02:59:19,160
like all the rick and morty stuff.
All right.

4129
02:59:19,320 --> 02:59:20,250
Pull your mic over,
Alex.

4130
02:59:20,430 --> 02:59:21,030
Oh,
sorry.

4131
02:59:21,030 --> 02:59:23,180
Oh yeah.
Um,

4132
02:59:23,520 --> 02:59:25,830
the orange sweater,
that thing is pretty,

4133
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:30,390
that is one of a kind size large.
Oh,

4134
02:59:30,750 --> 02:59:32,430
right.
This is also such large,

4135
02:59:32,580 --> 02:59:33,810
you know,
looking at the blue wheel,

4136
02:59:33,811 --> 02:59:35,940
I think that turned out pretty good.
I don't know why.

4137
02:59:36,780 --> 02:59:38,300
I feel like that's a cool sweater 
actually.

4138
02:59:38,350 --> 02:59:39,480
Yeah,
it's very calming.

4139
02:59:40,090 --> 02:59:45,060
It like after seeing like Joey Joey's 
feet and milk,

4140
02:59:45,240 --> 02:59:46,073
that's the only thing that could calm me
down is looking at that like knitted 

4141
02:59:48,410 --> 02:59:49,800
bear sweater.

4142
02:59:49,910 --> 02:59:50,990
Yeah.
So peaceful.

4143
02:59:52,290 --> 02:59:57,290
This one was bid on by Dana 500.
This is also one of a kind.

4144
02:59:57,390 --> 03:00:01,050
It's also like show the inside Dana 
could like live inside that thing.

4145
03:00:02,520 --> 03:00:03,900
Oh,
it is a size large.

4146
03:00:04,230 --> 03:00:08,400
Whoops.
But you cannot see girls like to wear it

4147
03:00:08,401 --> 03:00:09,360
oversize.
It's okay.

4148
03:00:09,390 --> 03:00:12,360
So here you can see the inspiration for 
the rainbow sweater.

4149
03:00:12,690 --> 03:00:14,850
Yeah,
the inside we were like,

4150
03:00:14,851 --> 03:00:16,710
Whoa,
that's fricking awesome.

4151
03:00:16,950 --> 03:00:19,050
Whoever tried it on,
we took it off and we were like,

4152
03:00:19,051 --> 03:00:21,210
wait,
this is really amazing.

4153
03:00:21,211 --> 03:00:22,001
Oh my God.
Yeah.

4154
03:00:22,001 --> 03:00:23,100
Yeah.
Happy accident.

4155
03:00:23,490 --> 03:00:25,350
That's such a cool color scheme.
Yeah.

4156
03:00:25,830 --> 03:00:29,370
So we ended up selling the rainbow 
version,

4157
03:00:29,371 --> 03:00:33,240
which was a hand sold out really fast.
Oh,

4158
03:00:33,241 --> 03:00:35,940
we've got amps.
We got donations,

4159
03:00:36,180 --> 03:00:38,880
donations are going up.
We're at almost 53,000

4160
03:00:38,970 --> 03:00:39,781
great,
nice.

4161
03:00:39,781 --> 03:00:41,310
So this is,
this is just as,

4162
03:00:41,311 --> 03:00:43,260
um,
we'll set this up somewhere,

4163
03:00:43,261 --> 03:00:45,300
but yeah,
I think that couch right here.

4164
03:00:45,570 --> 03:00:46,950
Karaoke mic.
Um,

4165
03:00:46,980 --> 03:00:47,813
yeah,
but so a lot of our stuff isn't showing 

4166
03:00:48,811 --> 03:00:49,644
up on mobile.
I think that's the majority of people 

4167
03:00:51,391 --> 03:00:54,340
are on their phones and they're not 
seeing like the ability to,

4168
03:00:54,400 --> 03:00:57,680
to buy,
to be able to write on your face or on,

4169
03:00:57,750 --> 03:00:59,570
are you kidding me?
There's more tilt five.

4170
03:00:59,571 --> 03:01:01,570
Oh,
and I get on it.

4171
03:01:03,160 --> 03:01:04,780
It's fucking us again,
Dan.

4172
03:01:05,100 --> 03:01:06,940
Oh No.
Dan Are you,

4173
03:01:07,150 --> 03:01:08,920
are you there?
Yeah,

4174
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:13,390
I wouldn't say fucking that's right on 
mobile.

4175
03:01:13,391 --> 03:01:15,610
And you can't donate for reaching out to
him right now.

4176
03:01:15,820 --> 03:01:17,420
I would out,
you know,

4177
03:01:17,440 --> 03:01:19,380
take it easy.
I don't,

4178
03:01:19,540 --> 03:01:22,180
where do you see,
I'm like playing both sides.

4179
03:01:22,300 --> 03:01:24,040
Where do you see it?
On the laptop.

4180
03:01:24,820 --> 03:01:26,380
Where do you see it?
Even on a laptop.

4181
03:01:26,381 --> 03:01:29,830
I'm not sure I supposed to here,
let me check.

4182
03:01:30,370 --> 03:01:32,540
I haven't looked on a laptop.
Well here if you,

4183
03:01:32,650 --> 03:01:33,483
I'll do it on the screen here.
Go to rewards and go all the way to the 

4184
03:01:36,821 --> 03:01:38,140
bottom.
Oh,

4185
03:01:38,141 --> 03:01:39,970
they're not here.
It doesn't show Dan.

4186
03:01:39,971 --> 03:01:41,950
Yeah.
Why is that?

4187
03:01:43,960 --> 03:01:45,730
There?
Turns off cause we have backlog.

4188
03:01:46,620 --> 03:01:48,310
No,
I mean I didn't turn them off.

4189
03:01:48,610 --> 03:01:50,620
Hmm.
What are we missing?

4190
03:01:51,070 --> 03:01:53,020
What else do I seen?
Well,

4191
03:01:53,021 --> 03:01:58,021
let me look into it right now.
I guess people can donate if they donate

4192
03:01:58,511 --> 03:01:59,344
that amount.
We'll see if you donate 500 and tell us 

4193
03:02:01,061 --> 03:02:03,130
what you want to write that.
Don't do it.

4194
03:02:03,160 --> 03:02:03,993
Don't do that.
Let me,

4195
03:02:05,290 --> 03:02:07,330
that's very hard to keep track of.
Oh,

4196
03:02:07,331 --> 03:02:08,080
okay.
Okay.

4197
03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:08,913
Yeah.
I'll have a hard time finding it on 

4198
03:02:09,371 --> 03:02:10,810
mobile.
It's not there.

4199
03:02:11,870 --> 03:02:12,703
Like I'm seeing all the,
I'm seeing all the drawings and stuff 

4200
03:02:14,711 --> 03:02:17,340
and I'm not seeing any of the messages 
went up on mobile either.

4201
03:02:17,620 --> 03:02:19,300
Please.
No more gross gross humor.

4202
03:02:19,330 --> 03:02:23,560
This person does not want joey to shit 
in the pool.

4203
03:02:24,970 --> 03:02:27,010
I love,
I love Katie spending that dollar.

4204
03:02:27,070 --> 03:02:27,903
Like no more gross humor will have to 
turn off the stream of jellies shits in 

4205
03:02:31,091 --> 03:02:32,110
the pool.
Um,

4206
03:02:34,140 --> 03:02:34,973
um,
can someone bring me some water and 

4207
03:02:36,881 --> 03:02:37,840
also,
uh,

4208
03:02:37,870 --> 03:02:39,250
do we have more writing to do?

4209
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:40,660
Yeah.
Yeah,

4210
03:02:40,660 --> 03:02:41,493
I think,
I think we're back with you some water 

4211
03:02:42,431 --> 03:02:44,320
and yeah.
One thing and it's on,

4212
03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:46,353
hold on one sec.
I'm trying to fix the missing stuff 

4213
03:02:49,060 --> 03:02:50,260
first.
Okay.

4214
03:02:50,261 --> 03:02:51,310
You guys entertain.
Okay?

4215
03:02:51,680 --> 03:02:55,960
You Want me Ladies and gentlemen,
you for watching right now.

4216
03:02:56,210 --> 03:02:57,820
Let's see how many people are watching 
us?

4217
03:02:57,821 --> 03:02:59,230
20,000.
Hello?

4218
03:02:59,231 --> 03:03:00,340
20,000
people.

4219
03:03:00,341 --> 03:03:00,941
It's the,
uh,

4220
03:03:00,941 --> 03:03:02,600
it's the Alex and healers show right 
now.

4221
03:03:03,520 --> 03:03:04,780
As you could see,
uh,

4222
03:03:05,170 --> 03:03:06,003
we,
we are both sitting in chairs and it is 

4223
03:03:07,811 --> 03:03:10,030
thrilling.
It's thrilling to watch.

4224
03:03:10,420 --> 03:03:13,030
We want to draw things for you.
We don't know what to draw though.

4225
03:03:15,310 --> 03:03:16,810
Why don't you go,
oh no.

4226
03:03:17,260 --> 03:03:19,030
Oh my God.
Hey,

4227
03:03:19,450 --> 03:03:23,850
Justin brought in a pretty amazing,
hello.

4228
03:03:24,090 --> 03:03:24,923
Hello?
That's weird requests for what we want 

4229
03:03:28,091 --> 03:03:29,660
Justin to sing.
Yeah.

4230
03:03:30,330 --> 03:03:32,170
Hey,
no,

4231
03:03:32,171 --> 03:03:33,540
I'm not doing that.
I don't know.

4232
03:03:33,550 --> 03:03:35,470
You're kind of singing right now.
You sound pretty great.

4233
03:03:36,070 --> 03:03:38,770
That was like a kind of little Bob Dylan
Guy you were doing there.

4234
03:03:39,220 --> 03:03:42,000
I like the sound of that Fella.
That's not for me.

4235
03:03:42,020 --> 03:03:44,200
That's a new jam.
We're watching the donation.

4236
03:03:44,201 --> 03:03:45,034
So if you guys want to suggest stuff for
us to draw or to make sure that this is 

4237
03:03:48,650 --> 03:03:49,930
for Justin to sing.

4238
03:03:50,910 --> 03:03:54,170
I remember it wasn't working earlier.
Something for us to watch.

4239
03:03:55,010 --> 03:03:58,070
You guys want to be entertained?
We're rating the Oh,

4240
03:03:58,940 --> 03:04:00,080
okay.
Waiting back.

4241
03:04:00,110 --> 03:04:03,440
Are we back in the groove?
A nice camera and the microphone.

4242
03:04:03,470 --> 03:04:05,720
Uh,
just what are you doing?

4243
03:04:06,200 --> 03:04:07,340
Who me?
Yeah.

4244
03:04:07,880 --> 03:04:09,680
I'm just making sure that this 
microphone works.

4245
03:04:09,740 --> 03:04:11,150
Okay.
Why your phone?

4246
03:04:11,280 --> 03:04:14,480
G May I please buy one?
Ethan?

4247
03:04:14,481 --> 03:04:16,640
Dump Extra Brown.
Extra moist.

4248
03:04:17,390 --> 03:04:18,300
15 bucks.
Yeah,

4249
03:04:18,490 --> 03:04:20,060
I'll mail you some shit.
I don't know.

4250
03:04:20,061 --> 03:04:22,430
I feel like yours is worth more than 15 
come on.

4251
03:04:24,070 --> 03:04:25,540
Oh.
Oh.

4252
03:04:25,550 --> 03:04:26,383
This is our little chat stream.
Anyone need water and your water and 

4253
03:04:28,810 --> 03:04:30,260
water?
Something something.

4254
03:04:30,261 --> 03:04:31,094
Kingdom hearts.
I'll trade you this water for that 

4255
03:04:32,301 --> 03:04:34,700
water.
I do not understand.

4256
03:04:35,060 --> 03:04:35,893
Okay.
For some reason the Internet really 

4257
03:04:36,951 --> 03:04:39,070
wants me to play kingdom hearts and I,
hold on.

4258
03:04:39,500 --> 03:04:40,060
Why?
Why?

4259
03:04:40,060 --> 03:04:40,850
Oh,
Don,

4260
03:04:40,850 --> 03:04:42,620
he was going to watch a lady drinker on 
pit.

4261
03:04:42,650 --> 03:04:43,011
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

4262
03:04:43,011 --> 03:04:44,230
What are we doing?
Nice.

4263
03:04:44,240 --> 03:04:45,710
Jesus h get back on track.
Yeah.

4264
03:04:45,711 --> 03:04:47,990
Come on,
let's get back on track.

4265
03:04:47,991 --> 03:04:51,350
Ref 53,000
y'all better kick open those wallets.

4266
03:04:51,380 --> 03:04:53,470
Open them balls.
Open opening walls,

4267
03:04:53,480 --> 03:04:56,480
donation.
I feel like making a sizable donation.

4268
03:04:57,050 --> 03:04:57,883
You haven't already.
I think I'm going to wish we had more 

4269
03:04:59,721 --> 03:05:01,340
interesting poles,
but we really don't.

4270
03:05:01,760 --> 03:05:02,750
It's a,
it's a tricky thing.

4271
03:05:02,751 --> 03:05:03,980
Figuring out something that's like 
perfect.

4272
03:05:03,981 --> 03:05:04,814
Yeah.
Yeah.

4273
03:05:05,120 --> 03:05:05,953
You need to figure out exactly how 
torture the people in this room and 

4274
03:05:07,731 --> 03:05:08,564
equal terms equally torturing to all,
all of us had a good idea of like a 

4275
03:05:11,691 --> 03:05:14,550
competition,
like some sort of competition and,

4276
03:05:14,560 --> 03:05:16,370
and how do we monetize that?
Again,

4277
03:05:16,430 --> 03:05:17,690
I can't even remember.
Thank you.

4278
03:05:18,060 --> 03:05:19,760
I mean if we were just playing any kind 
of game,

4279
03:05:19,761 --> 03:05:22,230
we could just put down money.
We would pass.

4280
03:05:22,340 --> 03:05:24,260
We would bet her own hard earned money 
on it.

4281
03:05:24,560 --> 03:05:26,750
What can we do that involves US spending
money?

4282
03:05:29,120 --> 03:05:30,700
Well let's wash your lady drinker on 
pissed.

4283
03:05:30,701 --> 03:05:31,160
All right.
Yeah.

4284
03:05:31,160 --> 03:05:32,690
Yeah.
I think when in doubt,

4285
03:05:33,590 --> 03:05:34,640
here we go.
Why?

4286
03:05:35,200 --> 03:05:38,180
I don't know Ethan,
you think this is too gross?

4287
03:05:38,270 --> 03:05:40,370
Is that one girl was going to have to 
turn off this stream?

4288
03:05:40,520 --> 03:05:41,353
Well,
I mean,

4289
03:05:41,480 --> 03:05:45,440
how realistic is this drop off of John?
Alex,

4290
03:05:45,441 --> 03:05:47,600
do you want me to draw Papa John?
Alright.

4291
03:05:47,860 --> 03:05:48,980
Alright.
Strange.

4292
03:05:48,990 --> 03:05:49,823
Addictive thinking that was fun.
Which she believes will maintain her 

4293
03:05:53,001 --> 03:05:54,680
house cast.
Carter,

4294
03:05:55,520 --> 03:05:59,030
my strange your that you love this show.
Honda's my strange addiction.

4295
03:05:59,090 --> 03:06:00,010
Oh my God.
Yeah.

4296
03:06:00,011 --> 03:06:01,550
I feel like you guys are late to the 
party though.

4297
03:06:01,551 --> 03:06:04,400
This is stuff I was watching you know,
years ago.

4298
03:06:06,090 --> 03:06:07,910
What have you moved on to,
man,

4299
03:06:07,911 --> 03:06:09,500
I'm so far.
You're going to be like,

4300
03:06:09,501 --> 03:06:11,030
what?
What are you talking about?

4301
03:06:11,430 --> 03:06:12,630
It's futuristic,
man.

4302
03:06:13,030 --> 03:06:13,863
No,
but I have been watching a show that's 

4303
03:06:14,691 --> 03:06:15,251
a,
it's a,

4304
03:06:15,251 --> 03:06:19,430
it's a BBC show that sorta like Bachelor
in paradise.

4305
03:06:19,490 --> 03:06:21,380
I can't remember the name but you know,
whatever.

4306
03:06:22,010 --> 03:06:24,680
Oh somebody donate a dollar and remind 
me what it's called.

4307
03:06:24,681 --> 03:06:25,940
But it's like,
it's on Hulu.

4308
03:06:26,390 --> 03:06:27,223
I think it's on Hulu or someone donate a
dollar and remind me what channel it's 

4309
03:06:30,321 --> 03:06:35,321
on,
but it's a higher oh idea.

4310
03:06:38,140 --> 03:06:39,010
Hey stop.
No,

4311
03:06:39,360 --> 03:06:43,260
no.
Justin refuses to see there's no,

4312
03:06:43,270 --> 03:06:44,460
no,
let's by here.

4313
03:06:45,160 --> 03:06:47,800
Cause Aussie Aussie can play and then 
you're dumb asking,

4314
03:06:47,810 --> 03:06:49,400
saying,
wow,

4315
03:06:49,401 --> 03:06:50,234
really.
Also Justin should draw on know what 

4316
03:06:53,110 --> 03:06:54,920
crashed for me.
Oh,

4317
03:06:55,230 --> 03:06:56,063
I see Justin

4318
03:06:56,090 --> 03:06:57,300
[inaudible].
I don't see it.

4319
03:06:57,540 --> 03:06:59,940
You don't see it?

4329
03:07:19,790 --> 03:07:21,920
I'm going to donate at least another 
2000.

4330
03:07:21,980 --> 03:07:24,170
I mean the guy flew all the way here

4331
03:07:24,171 --> 03:07:26,640

draw a rick and Stan celebrating the 

4336
03:07:34,671 --> 03:07:36,230
holidays together.
So add that to your list.

4337
03:07:36,231 --> 03:07:37,110
Make that happen.

4338
03:07:37,111 --> 03:07:37,944

Yes.

4339
03:07:38,380 --> 03:07:39,213
Hi.
You're buying and somebody wants me to 

4340
03:07:40,351 --> 03:07:41,990
sing country roads.
I don't know what that is,

4341
03:07:41,991 --> 03:07:45,020
but I could try.
Let's watch a lady drinker on Piss.

Drink your own pit.

4348
03:07:55,930 --> 03:07:59,030
Sorry.
Here we go.

4349
03:07:59,090 --> 03:08:00,110
Nice.
Oh,

03:08:00,111 --> 03:08:03,830

If you guys want to draw on the,

4351
03:08:03,831 --> 03:08:05,960
on everyone's faces,
it's a up again,

4352
03:08:06,320 --> 03:08:10,950
I think I do some as well.
Um,

4353
03:08:11,300 --> 03:08:12,030
let's go ahead.

4354
03:08:12,030 --> 03:08:12,321
Yeah,
I'm,

4355
03:08:12,321 --> 03:08:16,300
I'm watching Carrie and 50 years old.
I'm from Colorado.

4356
03:08:18,190 --> 03:08:22,410
I'm watching drinking my urine break.
Your color,

4357
03:08:23,030 --> 03:08:25,150
your vitamin D vitamins,
that's for sure.

4358
03:08:26,100 --> 03:08:29,970
It's easier to drink than water.
They drink the water.

4359
03:08:30,710 --> 03:08:34,680
Carry all the liquid is all easy 
streets.

4360
03:08:34,800 --> 03:08:35,340
Well,
uh,

4361
03:08:35,340 --> 03:08:36,151
well,
you know,

4362
03:08:36,151 --> 03:08:38,160
I would disagree with that.
You consider,

4363
03:08:38,161 --> 03:08:38,994
uh,
you know,

4364
03:08:39,410 --> 03:08:41,760
first flyer viscosity.
All right.

4365
03:08:41,770 --> 03:08:42,510
All right.
You got this.

4366
03:08:42,510 --> 03:08:43,890
Gostudy are fine.
I mean,

4367
03:08:43,891 --> 03:08:45,810
saltwater is not,
you know,

4368
03:08:45,840 --> 03:08:47,420
Alex frankly,
speaker

4369
03:08:48,030 --> 03:08:50,480
my building the largest one or yarn 
morning.

4370
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:54,190
Now she consumes up to five glasses 
every day.

4371
03:08:54,220 --> 03:08:55,150
You know,
I feel like I'm wasting

4372
03:08:55,460 --> 03:08:56,293
great urinary.
No,

4373
03:08:56,300 --> 03:08:57,051
this is great.
No,

4374
03:08:57,051 --> 03:08:57,511
no,
keep going.

4375
03:08:57,511 --> 03:09:00,130
I'm sorry.
I'm buckled this big common buckle.

4376
03:09:00,180 --> 03:09:02,640
Then let's go ahead and buckle down.
I'm here to get eight glasses a day.

4377
03:09:02,641 --> 03:09:04,420
I heard that eight eight,
eight oh nine.

4378
03:09:04,470 --> 03:09:05,303
She is addicted to it,
but it looks like she's suffering when 

4379
03:09:06,841 --> 03:09:07,800
she drank.
Well,

4380
03:09:07,801 --> 03:09:09,150
let's listen to her.
Listen guys,

4381
03:09:09,151 --> 03:09:09,984
let's,
let's see.

4382
03:09:10,110 --> 03:09:10,943
Let's go over this.
Let's listen for a minute and see where 

4383
03:09:13,550 --> 03:09:14,530
we are.
Where we're buddy.

4384
03:09:14,640 --> 03:09:16,560
Focus right on it,
dude.

4385
03:09:16,561 --> 03:09:19,560
Drinking your own year.
Let's see where we're at with her.

4386
03:09:19,670 --> 03:09:21,930
All right,
everybody ready?

4387
03:09:22,470 --> 03:09:23,303
Okay.

4388
03:09:24,180 --> 03:09:29,180
It's comforting.
It don't make fun of this moment.

4389
03:09:30,700 --> 03:09:31,533
I'm trying to make sense of it all.
The first time I drank my year and I 

4390
03:09:36,091 --> 03:09:41,091
didn't throw out and it wasn't horrible.
So I thought you trusted can do this.

4391
03:09:45,190 --> 03:09:46,023
So

4392
03:09:46,140 --> 03:09:49,080
you know what the first time I drank my 
urine,

4393
03:09:49,630 --> 03:09:51,990
not bad.
I didn't throw up.

4394
03:09:52,470 --> 03:09:53,590
I can do this.
Yeah.

4395
03:09:53,800 --> 03:09:54,190
So

4396
03:09:54,190 --> 03:09:55,810
I have a couple of questions.
Why,

4397
03:09:56,810 --> 03:09:57,970
why did you,
why did you,

4398
03:09:58,040 --> 03:09:58,980
what,
what I,

4399
03:09:58,990 --> 03:09:59,980
if she was here,
I'd go,

4400
03:09:59,981 --> 03:10:00,401
well,
what,

4401
03:10:00,401 --> 03:10:01,234
like very respectfully,
why did you want to drink your own 

4402
03:10:04,211 --> 03:10:05,320
urine?
Good.

4403
03:10:05,680 --> 03:10:06,513
Um,
I think she was doing it as some health 

4404
03:10:07,961 --> 03:10:09,550
kick.
She's like,

4405
03:10:09,551 --> 03:10:11,980
Oh,
I saw it somewhere.

4406
03:10:11,981 --> 03:10:14,580
I was at the,
I was at the corner of a lake or like at

4407
03:10:14,590 --> 03:10:16,540
the edge of a lake and a charity stream.
Dude,

4408
03:10:16,541 --> 03:10:21,541
she was just like us.
This is what it escalates to get joey to

4409
03:10:21,911 --> 03:10:23,660
drink his own piss her front.
Oh,

4410
03:10:24,560 --> 03:10:26,410
free sleep.
Her making that kind of money.

4411
03:10:27,310 --> 03:10:30,610
I mean if it's this easy for her,
well Joey's piston his mouth famously,

4412
03:10:31,300 --> 03:10:33,260
but if he goes to the bathroom contract 
with a jar,

4413
03:10:33,280 --> 03:10:34,810
piss would we kicked down to watch them 
drink?

4414
03:10:34,890 --> 03:10:37,180
Thank you too,
but just would shut the street down.

4415
03:10:37,690 --> 03:10:41,260
He hasn't done one show deck is just,
he comes down with the yellow.

4416
03:10:41,320 --> 03:10:43,450
I mean we're watching her drink piss.
What's the difference?

4417
03:10:44,080 --> 03:10:44,750
I mean,
listen,

4418
03:10:44,750 --> 03:10:48,480
I leave it up to the audience and uh,
you know,

4419
03:10:48,490 --> 03:10:52,570
pay with your wallets or what is it a 
vote with your wallets?

4420
03:10:52,571 --> 03:10:53,260
I mean,
do,

4421
03:10:53,260 --> 03:10:55,150
who wants to Wash Joey?
Let's do a poll.

4422
03:10:55,210 --> 03:10:56,410
Let's do a poll.
Well wait,

4423
03:10:56,411 --> 03:10:57,520
hold on.
Can I get back to this?

4424
03:10:57,550 --> 03:10:58,710
Like what?
What on,

4425
03:10:58,720 --> 03:10:59,553
hold on.
I want to,

4426
03:11:00,340 --> 03:11:03,190
do you want joey to drink his own piss?
Yes or yes or no?

4427
03:11:03,240 --> 03:11:05,170
Thanks.
Joe Even agreed to this.

4428
03:11:07,630 --> 03:11:09,010
He just said,
I'm not doing it.

4429
03:11:09,410 --> 03:11:11,910
That going to poll,
you know,

4430
03:11:11,920 --> 03:11:12,753
drink his pool water.
But the problem is I'm not doing it 

4431
03:11:14,921 --> 03:11:19,810
unless the entirety of this bowl hits 
like fucking 50 grand or 40 grand,

4432
03:11:20,250 --> 03:11:22,310
which is,
you know jody not going to happen.

4433
03:11:22,860 --> 03:11:24,760
Will you ask him?
I did.

4434
03:11:24,761 --> 03:11:25,750
He said No.
He said,

4435
03:11:25,751 --> 03:11:28,930
hell no.
He said he hasn't done that in years.

4436
03:11:28,931 --> 03:11:31,890
He's over it.
He hasn't done that fast.

4437
03:11:32,710 --> 03:11:33,640
No,
no.

4438
03:11:33,641 --> 03:11:34,474
Better time than now.
Dog grown up to know what can we get a 

4439
03:11:36,920 --> 03:11:37,870
bike joey?

4440
03:11:38,240 --> 03:11:38,600
Yeah.

4441
03:11:38,600 --> 03:11:39,433
Yeah.
Once you drink tasting your own piss 

4442
03:11:43,020 --> 03:11:43,830
here.
No.

4443
03:11:43,830 --> 03:11:44,663
I'll let her know.
How much for you to drink your own 

4444
03:11:45,571 --> 03:11:47,910
person today.
That's not happening.

4445
03:11:50,970 --> 03:11:53,770
I'm not seeing stuff still.
It's like fucking pissing me off.

4446
03:11:54,390 --> 03:11:56,370
Dan,
are you making an equivalence between me

4447
03:11:56,371 --> 03:11:58,540
drinking my own piss and Joey Salads?
I mean the guy's,

4448
03:11:59,970 --> 03:12:02,130
he's a known mouth.
Buser he said no,

4449
03:12:02,131 --> 03:12:05,640
so I was seeing if you'd be down.
Are you down to drink your on pissed?

4450
03:12:05,641 --> 03:12:06,930
Absolutely not.
Okay.

4451
03:12:06,931 --> 03:12:09,240
Well obviously you don't care about burn
victims.

4452
03:12:10,710 --> 03:12:11,780
We got pizza here.
Standby.

4453
03:12:16,150 --> 03:12:18,810
Yeah,
it tasted it did four years ago.

4454
03:12:19,640 --> 03:12:23,920
Sometimes the southgate,
champaign,

4455
03:12:23,930 --> 03:12:28,930
sometimes it tastes like champagne.
Sometimes it tastes like lemon.

4456
03:12:33,360 --> 03:12:37,560
I liked this raw shit in my mouth.
I want to know why.

4457
03:12:37,620 --> 03:12:38,453
I want to like why she started like what
got her start like what was the day 

4458
03:12:41,821 --> 03:12:43,760
where she was like,
I'm going to do this here.

4459
03:12:43,761 --> 03:12:45,930
Listen to this quote of her saying,
you know,

4460
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:47,910
I tried,
it wasn't so bad.

4461
03:12:48,060 --> 03:12:49,860
I can do this.
I can do this.

4462
03:12:49,920 --> 03:12:51,350
It's a health kick.
It is.

4463
03:12:51,360 --> 03:12:52,193
Yeah.
There's a whole counter or there's a 

4464
03:12:53,631 --> 03:12:55,910
whole help saying that,
but I'm telling you,

4465
03:12:55,911 --> 03:12:57,890
there's a bunch of pissed drinkers out 
there.

4466
03:12:57,920 --> 03:12:59,690
She's not the only one.
Rain.

4467
03:12:59,691 --> 03:13:01,250
Florence is another one.
Yeah.

4468
03:13:03,550 --> 03:13:04,660
And will you enjoy this?

4469
03:13:07,580 --> 03:13:09,590
Maybe a little lemony,
a little lemonade.

4470
03:13:10,190 --> 03:13:12,930
You can taste different things going 
through your bodies.

4471
03:13:12,950 --> 03:13:13,783
There are certain things.
I don't like to eat it anymore because 

4472
03:13:16,611 --> 03:13:19,400
they know it tastes good.
Oh,

4473
03:13:19,440 --> 03:13:21,070
you mean like this?
Love,

4474
03:13:21,080 --> 03:13:22,370
love,
love asparagus.

4475
03:13:22,640 --> 03:13:23,860
I won't need it.
And he gets,

4476
03:13:24,010 --> 03:13:25,570
nope,
it makes the hearing tasting.

4477
03:13:26,320 --> 03:13:27,920
I'll take a Hawaiian Hawaiian.
Yeah,

4478
03:13:27,921 --> 03:13:30,490
a pizza already a flavor Hawaiian.
Oh,

4479
03:13:30,491 --> 03:13:32,110
we have cheese,
we have mushroom,

4480
03:13:32,720 --> 03:13:35,860
the works.
I'll just take a slice a,

4481
03:13:36,820 --> 03:13:37,630
what do you guys want?
Yeah,

4482
03:13:37,630 --> 03:13:39,980
I mean we can come out and grab a slice 
till two.

4483
03:13:40,590 --> 03:13:42,330
Yeah.
Uh,

4484
03:13:42,340 --> 03:13:43,200
yeah.
We'll just come up.

4485
03:13:43,240 --> 03:13:44,900
We'll just,
yeah,

4486
03:13:44,930 --> 03:13:45,850
whatever.
Flex the cheese.

4487
03:13:46,300 --> 03:13:47,133
Yeah.

4488
03:13:48,980 --> 03:13:51,250
Well we really hit a low point on the 
street.

4489
03:13:51,340 --> 03:13:54,330
Everyone's just sitting here.
I focused on this drawing.

4490
03:13:55,750 --> 03:13:57,200
She's got a daughter.
You guys,

4491
03:13:57,201 --> 03:13:58,780
her daughter's going to comment on the 
piss.

4492
03:13:58,790 --> 03:14:01,160
Drinking show the drawing.
All right.

4493
03:14:01,190 --> 03:14:03,060
I'm watching this piss video y'all can 
do it.

4494
03:14:05,500 --> 03:14:08,350
Body has decided to filter through and 
get,

4495
03:14:08,710 --> 03:14:11,830
get rid of.
So it doesn't seem healthy to me that to

4496
03:14:11,831 --> 03:14:13,180
put that back into your body.

4497
03:14:13,700 --> 03:14:14,533
Yeah.
Carrie doesn't drink urine just because 

4498
03:14:16,161 --> 03:14:16,994
she loves the taste.
Her addiction began two years after 

4499
03:14:20,181 --> 03:14:21,950
being diagnosed with cancer.

4500
03:14:22,870 --> 03:14:26,950
Really diagnosed with one of the,
of course,

4501
03:14:26,951 --> 03:14:30,640
the number one a month.
Got It.

4502
03:14:31,570 --> 03:14:34,330
Got It.
That's of course the,

4503
03:14:34,331 --> 03:14:36,320
uh,
the doctor recommended.

4504
03:14:36,460 --> 03:14:37,293
That's just a sign of how fucking loss 
we are as a species when it comes to 

4505
03:14:41,140 --> 03:14:44,290
something as horrible as cancer.
It's like,

4506
03:14:44,291 --> 03:14:45,340
yeah.
It's like,

4507
03:14:45,341 --> 03:14:46,140
I'll just,
I have,

4508
03:14:46,140 --> 03:14:48,700
I guess I'll fucking drink my piss then.
I mean,

4509
03:14:48,701 --> 03:14:50,080
it's like,
okay,

4510
03:14:50,081 --> 03:14:52,000
what else am I going to do?
Maybe that'll work.

4511
03:14:52,001 --> 03:14:53,380
I mean,
that's just fucking depressed.

4512
03:14:54,550 --> 03:14:57,280
Really sad spin on this story.
Well,

4513
03:14:57,281 --> 03:15:00,490
I believe Justin,
she's cured and she's still drinking her

4514
03:15:00,491 --> 03:15:01,300
peers.
All right,

4515
03:15:01,300 --> 03:15:02,580
so don't be too sad.
Oh,

4516
03:15:02,650 --> 03:15:03,483
she loves it.

4517
03:15:05,410 --> 03:15:06,243
Stage three and they took out 16 of my 
lymph nodes found cancer in three of 

4518
03:15:10,601 --> 03:15:15,601
them and do this and they told me with 
the chemo I'd have a year to now.

4519
03:15:18,140 --> 03:15:22,100
Carrie decided against chemo instead 
turning to urine therapy.

4520
03:15:22,150 --> 03:15:22,983
Is it working ancient and long 
discounted practice to maintain health 

4521
03:15:25,700 --> 03:15:27,320
ancient and long discounted.

4522
03:15:28,550 --> 03:15:29,110
Okay.

4523
03:15:29,110 --> 03:15:29,943
Is it,

4524
03:15:30,360 --> 03:15:34,590
does it work for four years later?
She still uses it to five years later.

4525
03:15:34,591 --> 03:15:35,890
He's crushing it.
She's alive.

4526
03:15:36,160 --> 03:15:39,380
She has never consulted a physician 
about her unorthodox treat.

4527
03:15:39,750 --> 03:15:42,780
Wouldn't that be funny if the cure of 
cancer was just actually this whole time

4528
03:15:42,781 --> 03:15:43,614
drinking your own piss,
it sounds like that's what they're 

4529
03:15:45,691 --> 03:15:46,524
saying.
Yeah.

4530
03:15:46,570 --> 03:15:48,240
They couldn't put it on tv,
but it wasn't true.

4531
03:15:49,170 --> 03:15:50,020
Here we go.
This is,

4532
03:15:50,040 --> 03:15:51,450
this is your pocket,
John Right here.

4533
03:15:52,380 --> 03:15:54,370
He's admitted.
He's devouring this.

4534
03:15:55,410 --> 03:15:58,150
We're drippy pizza.
Alex tried to capture his stolen.

4535
03:15:58,530 --> 03:16:01,450
I tried to capture like,
he's like a wrestler.

4536
03:16:01,451 --> 03:16:04,830
What was happening inside his heart but 
devouring his own pizza.

4537
03:16:04,831 --> 03:16:05,664
There it is.
This like a play on like a saturn 

4538
03:16:08,191 --> 03:16:13,191
devouring his son plastic for all your 
art or art fans out there is amazing.

4539
03:16:15,370 --> 03:16:18,390
Wow.
Is this this right here,

4540
03:16:18,420 --> 03:16:20,130
dude.
That's amazing.

4541
03:16:21,470 --> 03:16:22,480
Bring in mind close.
Sorry.

4542
03:16:22,930 --> 03:16:23,370
Yeah,
sorry.

4543
03:16:23,370 --> 03:16:24,480
Yeah,
yeah,

4544
03:16:24,481 --> 03:16:25,350
that.
Wow.

4545
03:16:25,410 --> 03:16:26,243
That is incredible.
That is so for someone in the Papa 

4546
03:16:29,240 --> 03:16:32,070
John's family is going to be bidding on 
that [inaudible] himself.

4547
03:16:32,071 --> 03:16:32,904
Man.
John's going to want that above his 

4548
03:16:33,511 --> 03:16:35,430
mantle.
It's going to remind him of the power he

4549
03:16:35,431 --> 03:16:36,264
gets from eating his own pizza.
It's can remind him of how high he's 

4550
03:16:39,001 --> 03:16:40,470
climbed,
how far he's fallen.

4551
03:16:42,300 --> 03:16:43,530
Oh yeah.
One of these.

4552
03:16:43,531 --> 03:16:47,550
So much art to sketches.
We got a karaoke machine there,

4553
03:16:47,551 --> 03:16:48,031
right?
Yeah.

4554
03:16:48,031 --> 03:16:50,820
We gotta be doing Karaoke.
We gotta be doing care.

4555
03:16:50,970 --> 03:16:52,120
Rio.
Can you want to sing it?

4556
03:16:52,121 --> 03:16:53,000
You want to sing with me?

4557
03:16:55,150 --> 03:16:57,820
My favorite song.

4558
03:16:58,010 --> 03:16:58,843
So what's the deal?
How do we get people to pay $500 you 

4559
03:17:04,640 --> 03:17:08,770
named the person on the list like people
are,

4560
03:17:08,890 --> 03:17:09,723
people are,
people are able to donate and she'll 

4561
03:17:11,841 --> 03:17:13,580
learn whatever song,
um,

4562
03:17:14,270 --> 03:17:18,020
$500 you named the song,
you name the person.

4563
03:17:18,890 --> 03:17:21,020
I think that's $500.
You understand?

4564
03:17:21,021 --> 03:17:22,130
You hear that?
What if,

4565
03:17:22,131 --> 03:17:24,230
what if the person doesn't know the 
song?

4566
03:17:24,290 --> 03:17:25,610
They just have to wing it.
Well,

4567
03:17:25,611 --> 03:17:27,290
we can probably pull up the lyric.
Okay.

4568
03:17:27,291 --> 03:17:27,711
Yeah,
yeah,

4569
03:17:27,711 --> 03:17:28,221
yeah,
that's right.

4570
03:17:28,221 --> 03:17:29,900
We'll just find a karaoke video.
Yeah,

4571
03:17:29,901 --> 03:17:30,830
exactly.
All right.

4572
03:17:30,831 --> 03:17:32,090
We're doing this.
I'm in,

4573
03:17:32,091 --> 03:17:34,730
I'm in on this and I'll sing any songs 
for 500 bucks for charity.

4574
03:17:34,731 --> 03:17:35,930
Absolutely.
Dan.

4575
03:17:37,960 --> 03:17:41,480
Hey,
500 bucks.

4576
03:17:41,720 --> 03:17:44,950
Sing any song.
And they get to choose.

4577
03:17:44,951 --> 03:17:46,840
They choose the person in the song 
person.

4578
03:17:46,890 --> 03:17:50,840
And we doing this instead of for Ozzie 
to come in and in a company.

4579
03:17:50,841 --> 03:17:51,680
Well,
this is an addition.

4580
03:17:51,681 --> 03:17:52,560
This is an addition.
Oh,

4581
03:17:52,561 --> 03:17:53,394
this is an addition.
Okay.

4582
03:17:53,430 --> 03:17:54,580
Yeah.
Oh,

4583
03:17:55,310 --> 03:17:57,110
copywriter.
Yeah.

4584
03:17:57,200 --> 03:17:58,880

4585
03:17:58,881 --> 03:18:00,860

I mean,
I've never seen anything as long bought 

4596
03:18:20,531 --> 03:18:22,920
a phone on broken,
you just can't find the draw.

4597
03:18:22,940 --> 03:18:23,900
I just,
I like,

4598
03:18:23,910 --> 03:18:25,440
I give up.
I can't,

all right.
I give up,

4601
03:18:27,900 --> 03:18:30,660
I give up what's happening.
I don't even fucking know.

4602
03:18:30,661 --> 03:18:31,494
It's like,
I'm so,

4603
03:18:31,800 --> 03:18:34,170
it's so it's impossible.
I try.

4604
03:18:34,171 --> 03:18:34,880
Okay.
You want to know,

4605
03:18:34,880 --> 03:18:36,000

4606
03:18:36,001 --> 03:18:39,650
So I tried to,

to fucking draw something on your face 
and,

4610
03:18:45,910 --> 03:18:48,160
and every time I fill it out it like 
resets

4611
03:18:48,160 --> 03:18:48,993
and then it's like I have to fill it out
again and then I go to paypal and it's 

4612
03:18:51,641 --> 03:18:52,474

I was trying to fucking do something and

4620
03:19:08,041 --> 03:19:11,340
I had to start over nine times and I was
ready to jump out the window.

4621
03:19:11,341 --> 03:19:14,640
So that could be why we're only at 
$55,000

4622
03:19:14,910 --> 03:19:15,743
because we're,
it's,

4623
03:19:15,810 --> 03:19:17,020
it's,
it's a broken,

4624
03:19:17,750 --> 03:19:21,510
it's a bright fucking mess.
Can we pick another Goddamn company?

4625
03:19:21,630 --> 03:19:23,500
Tilt the Phi you want to call it?
Let's get tilt.

4626
03:19:23,501 --> 03:19:24,334
Defy on the phone.
I want to get the CEO of tilt to fight 

4627
03:19:26,151 --> 03:19:28,080
and I want to,
I want them to atone.

4628
03:19:28,320 --> 03:19:30,320
I want him to fix our problems.

4629
03:19:31,610 --> 03:19:32,650
You know,
take it easy.

4630
03:19:32,651 --> 03:19:34,120
That's a,
that's a prank call right there.

4631
03:19:34,121 --> 03:19:36,560
Yes.
Britain called the act.

4632
03:19:36,600 --> 03:19:39,070
The thing we're using to generate all 
this money here.

4633
03:19:39,100 --> 03:19:41,640
Their website crashed on us.
Oh yeah.

4634
03:19:41,650 --> 03:19:45,580
Guess that they had made a lot of gains 
because the thing about tilts,

4635
03:19:45,581 --> 03:19:47,230
fight,
they had a lot of question.

4636
03:19:47,231 --> 03:19:48,100
Let me ask Dan.
Dan,

4637
03:19:48,101 --> 03:19:49,120
if you're listening,
you look,

4638
03:19:49,121 --> 03:19:49,954
can you bring some zoo?

4639
03:19:50,200 --> 03:19:52,960
How many,
how many face drawing things have sold,

4640
03:19:53,740 --> 03:19:56,710
how many Aussie music things

4641
03:19:57,200 --> 03:20:00,350
I haven't seen for Aussie yet because we
just threw that up a few minutes ago.

4642
03:20:01,590 --> 03:20:06,590
I mean we got a lot of those slots in 
any nuance.

4643
03:20:06,670 --> 03:20:08,170
And if for Jenny for uh,
even,

4644
03:20:08,430 --> 03:20:08,931
uh,
let me,

4645
03:20:08,931 --> 03:20:10,310
let me check if there's some new ones 
right now.

4646
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:11,193
Cause man,
I see a face that's just begging for 

4647
03:20:13,821 --> 03:20:14,654
drawing.
You just get forehead wants to mink on 

4648
03:20:16,101 --> 03:20:16,821
it right now,
man.

4649
03:20:16,821 --> 03:20:18,680
You guys need to watch Elan's 
announcement.

4650
03:20:18,681 --> 03:20:20,510
Who steals a cheese grater?

4651
03:20:21,250 --> 03:20:22,083
Wait,
what?

4652
03:20:24,930 --> 03:20:28,440
Give it another shot.
Thank you Justin.

4653
03:20:28,590 --> 03:20:29,423
This isn't,
well,

4654
03:20:29,490 --> 03:20:32,520
so now we've got

4655
03:20:33,600 --> 03:20:34,170
okay,

4656
03:20:34,170 --> 03:20:35,160
uh,
sold out.

4657
03:20:35,340 --> 03:20:37,270
Oh I can't.
Oh and then,

4658
03:20:37,271 --> 03:20:41,520
and then you're sold out and it says 
Aussie's thing says sold out then.

4659
03:20:42,100 --> 03:20:42,933
Okay.

4660
03:20:42,980 --> 03:20:44,470
And your thing,
your thing is like,

4661
03:20:44,480 --> 03:20:46,280
just drive me fucking crazy.
Let me see.

4662
03:20:46,281 --> 03:20:47,770
I want to see what you want to see what 
happens.

4663
03:20:48,330 --> 03:20:50,050
I'll be,
so justin is a type,

4664
03:20:50,270 --> 03:20:52,190
I'll go watch it.
It'd be like,

4665
03:20:52,970 --> 03:20:57,470
this is where I,
so justin is typing his request.

4666
03:20:58,850 --> 03:20:59,870
It says,
don't,

4667
03:20:59,871 --> 03:21:00,710
don't say it.
Don't read it.

4668
03:21:00,711 --> 03:21:01,520
Okay,
sure.

4669
03:21:01,520 --> 03:21:02,353
It's a surprise,
but I need to narrate the frustration 

4670
03:21:06,110 --> 03:21:07,040
they see.
That's good.

4671
03:21:07,070 --> 03:21:09,140
I want that.
I need that on me now.

4672
03:21:09,200 --> 03:21:10,580
It's great out,
right?

4673
03:21:10,760 --> 03:21:11,593
I want to hit that button.
So I think you have to write something 

4674
03:21:13,251 --> 03:21:13,870
here.
Maybe.

4675
03:21:13,870 --> 03:21:18,870
Okay.
Just say hi and then write out what else

4676
03:21:18,981 --> 03:21:20,960

Oh,

4677
03:21:21,020 --> 03:21:21,531
okay,

4678
03:21:21,531 --> 03:21:22,620
Was that,
what was the butter?

4679
03:21:22,770 --> 03:21:24,200
Okay,
I was doing that before.

4680
03:21:24,530 --> 03:21:26,710
Let me delete this because I don't want,
that's confusing.

4681
03:21:26,750 --> 03:21:28,640
You won.
So now donate.

4682
03:21:28,820 --> 03:21:30,350

Every time.

4688
03:21:41,840 --> 03:21:43,220
well we're in business,
right?

4689
03:21:43,221 --> 03:21:44,630
Frustrating.
We're in business.

4690
03:21:44,740 --> 03:21:45,620
Whoo.
Whoo.

4691
03:21:45,770 --> 03:21:46,070
Thank

4692
03:21:46,070 --> 03:21:46,640

4693
03:21:46,640 --> 03:21:48,450
I wanted to fucking,
I want this for wine.

4694
03:21:48,930 --> 03:21:50,360
I Love Hawaii.
What's wrong with a client?

4695
03:21:50,510 --> 03:21:51,680
Go ahead.
Just gets a bad rap dude.

4696
03:21:52,340 --> 03:21:54,110
Yeah.

4697
03:21:54,980 --> 03:21:55,813
Um,

4698
03:21:56,150 --> 03:21:56,761

4699
03:21:56,761 --> 03:21:57,810

Okay.

4701
03:22:00,050 --> 03:22:00,883
Ah,

I just think tilts.
Fires.

4703
03:22:05,020 --> 03:22:06,860
What?
What are you looking to do?

4704
03:22:07,010 --> 03:22:08,520
Did you just donate?
Well.

4705
03:22:09,310 --> 03:22:10,143
Well,
there's other people who donated 

4706
03:22:11,451 --> 03:22:13,610
apparently,
at least from my,

4707
03:22:13,670 --> 03:22:14,503
from my phone,
unless that's a Delta Phi is broken 

4708
03:22:17,060 --> 03:22:17,893
situation.

4709
03:22:19,650 --> 03:22:20,483
Okay.

4710
03:22:22,020 --> 03:22:24,400
Tony's in the mic.
I said,

4711
03:22:24,730 --> 03:22:27,950
know what man?
We got it.

4712
03:22:27,951 --> 03:22:31,290
We got beloved.
I mean we're in personalities.

4713
03:22:31,300 --> 03:22:32,133
We're and so deep on fine eating pizza 
and there's been a lot of trying to 

4714
03:22:36,381 --> 03:22:37,214
figure out what this is on the flight.
We're kind of building the plane while 

4715
03:22:38,931 --> 03:22:41,960
we're flying it a little bit here.
He could sing and I,

4716
03:22:41,980 --> 03:22:45,440
while we can't talk.
Well,

4717
03:22:45,441 --> 03:22:47,030
how about,
okay,

4718
03:22:47,031 --> 03:22:48,650
Cigna,
old man by Neil Young.

4719
03:22:48,710 --> 03:22:51,110
Bam.
Why don't we bring us,

4720
03:22:51,111 --> 03:22:55,210
he and Brian to come in and she here?
Yeah,

4721
03:22:55,370 --> 03:22:56,600
she's here,
but I got her set up.

4722
03:22:56,690 --> 03:22:58,910
Let's bring her in and does,
does this Mike g work?

4723
03:22:58,940 --> 03:23:00,230
Is this on?
No,

4724
03:23:00,231 --> 03:23:01,550
that one doesn't work.
We'll have to pull it.

4725
03:23:01,580 --> 03:23:02,720
I'll,
I'll come in and get her set up.

4726
03:23:03,140 --> 03:23:04,180
Okay.
Hey,

4727
03:23:04,190 --> 03:23:05,023
little blooper.

4728
03:23:06,270 --> 03:23:06,990
Okay.

4729
03:23:06,990 --> 03:23:07,830
The book,
donate him.

4730
03:23:08,250 --> 03:23:09,690
Alex called Disney.
Yeah.

4731
03:23:09,691 --> 03:23:11,580
I just,
I dial one 800 Disney.

4732
03:23:12,030 --> 03:23:12,691
I'm just like,
Hey,

4733
03:23:12,691 --> 03:23:16,200
thank you for the television show up by 
the very polite and respectful.

4734
03:23:16,800 --> 03:23:17,633
You tell me more about working for 
Disney because I always hear awful 

4735
03:23:19,280 --> 03:23:20,113
thing.
No,

4736
03:23:20,200 --> 03:23:20,890
I mean,
here's the thing,

4737
03:23:20,890 --> 03:23:25,740
like trying to talk about Disney is like
trying to talk about an entire country.

4738
03:23:25,940 --> 03:23:28,770
Like it's such a huge company that like 
if somebody be like,

4739
03:23:28,800 --> 03:23:29,581
Oh man,
you know,

4740
03:23:29,581 --> 03:23:30,414
I was,
it'd be like trying to talk about 

4741
03:23:31,411 --> 03:23:32,161
Google.
It's like,

4742
03:23:32,161 --> 03:23:33,060
well what?
Yeah,

4743
03:23:33,061 --> 03:23:34,710
which department?
But there's the park,

4744
03:23:34,711 --> 03:23:36,090
there's TV,
there's movies,

4745
03:23:36,091 --> 03:23:38,370
there's interactive.
Like I mean for me,

4746
03:23:38,371 --> 03:23:39,204
like I was just working for the kids 
channel and like the main problems 

4747
03:23:41,161 --> 03:23:43,650
weren't Disney's fault.
They were my fault for trying to work at

4748
03:23:43,651 --> 03:23:44,484
a kid's channel.
Cause like that's not how my brain 

4749
03:23:46,021 --> 03:23:47,010
naturally works.

4750
03:23:47,250 --> 03:23:48,870
And it was like one of these things 
where they're like,

4751
03:23:48,900 --> 03:23:50,040
oh,
we're going to pick up your show and I'm

4752
03:23:50,041 --> 03:23:51,180
like Rad.
And then I was like,

4753
03:23:51,210 --> 03:23:52,043
oh no,
they won't let me use any of the funny 

4754
03:23:53,281 --> 03:23:55,910
parts.
Do you have a good example?

4755
03:23:55,930 --> 03:23:59,130
Is aware of stuff you would fight?
Like hell yeah,

4756
03:23:59,190 --> 03:23:59,761
no,
I mean we,

4757
03:23:59,761 --> 03:24:00,620
um,
for,

4758
03:24:01,140 --> 03:24:03,180
for my wrap party,
for gravity falls,

4759
03:24:03,181 --> 03:24:06,930
I printed out a giant list of all the 
most bullshit snp notes that we ever got

4760
03:24:06,931 --> 03:24:08,910
and I just,
we did a dramatic reading of them.

4761
03:24:09,750 --> 03:24:10,583
We had like somebody playing the 
Moonlight Sonata in the background 

4762
03:24:12,061 --> 03:24:13,560
because it was so depressing and I was 
like,

4763
03:24:13,600 --> 03:24:17,680
I read my butt back and forth and 
somebody else read that cause like I,

4764
03:24:17,790 --> 03:24:20,070
I started out with this idea at the 
beginning of the channel.

4765
03:24:20,071 --> 03:24:20,850
Like,
okay,

4766
03:24:20,850 --> 03:24:22,140
it's a,
it's a conversation.

4767
03:24:22,141 --> 03:24:23,190
We're going to do our best,
you know,

4768
03:24:23,191 --> 03:24:24,024
if they have a disagreement,
we'll try to hash it out and I'm going 

4769
03:24:25,441 --> 03:24:27,630
to be respectful and by the end I would 
just be like,

4770
03:24:27,720 --> 03:24:28,830
I'm not changing.

4771
03:24:29,550 --> 03:24:31,470
Like I've got,
like if you'd just like flip through all

4772
03:24:31,471 --> 03:24:32,304
of the emails,
you'd see a man slowly losing his mind 

4773
03:24:33,631 --> 03:24:35,190
because they would just ask for the 
dumbest,

4774
03:24:35,191 --> 03:24:36,780
craziest bullshit.
Like,

4775
03:24:37,020 --> 03:24:38,280
um,
oh my God,

4776
03:24:38,281 --> 03:24:40,350
where do I even begin?
Like every puddle,

4777
03:24:40,680 --> 03:24:42,750
every shape,
every Bush,

4778
03:24:42,751 --> 03:24:43,800
every,
every cloud,

4779
03:24:43,801 --> 03:24:44,760
every puddle,
they'd be like,

4780
03:24:45,300 --> 03:24:47,430
let's looks like a dick.
Wow.

4781
03:24:47,810 --> 03:24:48,061
Yeah.
Well,

4782
03:24:48,061 --> 03:24:50,010
it's like if you're an s you're looking 
for day,

4783
03:24:50,220 --> 03:24:51,850
their job,
it's like you're going to cost you.

4784
03:24:52,460 --> 03:24:54,000
It's like you have to write a ticket.
You know what I mean?

4785
03:24:54,001 --> 03:24:56,160
Like they've got a quota,
they got to find these problems.

4786
03:24:56,161 --> 03:24:57,350
Even if they don't exist,
that's what,

4787
03:24:58,260 --> 03:25:01,320
that's their job is like,
see dicks were dicks don't exist.

4788
03:25:01,380 --> 03:25:02,213
Right.
So like constantly having to just like 

4789
03:25:04,130 --> 03:25:05,550
feel these questions,
they'd be like,

4790
03:25:05,580 --> 03:25:06,720
is that a secret deck?
I'd be like,

4791
03:25:06,900 --> 03:25:08,640
no,
that's a carrot.

4792
03:25:09,380 --> 03:25:13,000
Like constantly believe they pay people 
to just watch for dicks.

4793
03:25:13,360 --> 03:25:16,620
They find double entendres where there 
were no double entendres constantly.

4794
03:25:16,940 --> 03:25:19,140
Um,
imagine the,

4795
03:25:19,830 --> 03:25:20,770
well we would,
we,

4796
03:25:20,771 --> 03:25:22,470
we would like even,
I mean,

4797
03:25:22,650 --> 03:25:24,390
I don't know how much we should be 
talking about this,

4798
03:25:24,391 --> 03:25:25,730
but like on fish hooks,
it'd be like we,

4799
03:25:25,731 --> 03:25:26,564
we would,
we would write something and then 

4800
03:25:27,990 --> 03:25:32,670
without even thinking about the,
that it has the potential to be some way

4801
03:25:32,671 --> 03:25:33,060
in which,
yeah,

4802
03:25:33,060 --> 03:25:33,893
they'd always find it and then they 
would take the thing and they would be 

4803
03:25:35,521 --> 03:25:36,354
like,
oh,

4804
03:25:36,450 --> 03:25:38,690
like they dig up this lane,
it's like,

4805
03:25:38,720 --> 03:25:39,553
it's fine.
Like definition 12 on urban dictionary 

4806
03:25:41,161 --> 03:25:42,300
and they'd be like,
that's a,

4807
03:25:42,301 --> 03:25:45,210
that's an offensive phrase ever heard of
before.

4808
03:25:45,850 --> 03:25:46,683
It would be like this Rube Goldberg 
machine of like how it's offensive or 

4809
03:25:50,281 --> 03:25:53,880
how it could be perceived as a Dick 
Bush,

4810
03:25:53,950 --> 03:25:54,750
you know what I mean?

4811
03:25:54,750 --> 03:25:56,250
A lack of a better,
it was,

4812
03:25:56,310 --> 03:25:59,010
it was pretty well,
but I will say great place to work.

4813
03:25:59,820 --> 03:26:01,620
Uh,
a wonderful company.

4814
03:26:02,100 --> 03:26:02,933
Oh yeah.
I mean just don't tweet jokes and years 

4815
03:26:05,400 --> 03:26:08,190
ago the company was tweet jokes.
10 years ago,

4816
03:26:08,200 --> 03:26:09,810
whatever you do,
don't get in a time machine.

4817
03:26:09,811 --> 03:26:12,780
Not to be a show 10 years ago,
period.

4818
03:26:13,200 --> 03:26:14,400
Not do it.
Like they were Rad.

4819
03:26:14,401 --> 03:26:15,720
It was mainly just the standards 
department.

4820
03:26:15,721 --> 03:26:18,750
They were just like gigantic tools and 
that every firm from day to day,

4821
03:26:18,751 --> 03:26:20,040
week to week,
they would constantly change.

4822
03:26:20,250 --> 03:26:22,890
I remember one time we had like,
there was like,

4823
03:26:23,160 --> 03:26:24,450
there's like some scene where it was 
like,

4824
03:26:24,451 --> 03:26:25,620
oh,
we're going underground and there's some

4825
03:26:25,621 --> 03:26:27,120
trolls.
Um,

4826
03:26:27,150 --> 03:26:27,983
there's some like dwarves,
there's some ogres or whatever and 

4827
03:26:29,341 --> 03:26:29,821
they're like,
oh,

4828
03:26:29,821 --> 03:26:32,520
you cannot,
you cannot have dwarves anymore.

4829
03:26:32,550 --> 03:26:33,383
That team,
that term is kind of offensive and 

4830
03:26:34,501 --> 03:26:35,334
update and we would never allow,
we would never allow a dwarf to be in a 

4831
03:26:37,591 --> 03:26:38,580
Disney production.

4832
03:26:38,580 --> 03:26:39,413
And literally as they were saying that,
I was looking out my window looking at 

4833
03:26:41,431 --> 03:26:44,130
the giant stone,
seven dwarves holding up the roof of the

4834
03:26:44,131 --> 03:26:44,964
Disney filling and I was like these guys
are so I've completely gone off the 

4835
03:26:47,101 --> 03:26:49,940
fucking reservation.
They reboot the seven dwarves.

4836
03:26:49,941 --> 03:26:50,774
It was like a newer,
they call it the seven d maybe they 

4837
03:26:52,531 --> 03:26:54,720
can't say the word door,
I'm not sure.

4838
03:26:54,750 --> 03:26:55,583
And maybe they're right,
but it was just like the hypocrisy of 

4839
03:26:56,851 --> 03:26:57,684
like you guys just the roof is literally
being held up by giant stone one you're 

4840
03:27:00,391 --> 03:27:01,224
playing like a,
like a like a world of warcraft and you 

4841
03:27:03,240 --> 03:27:05,820
and your role at dwarf characters and 
that,

4842
03:27:06,030 --> 03:27:11,030
I mean yeah I'm not up or like I'm not 
an expert medical term.

4843
03:27:12,600 --> 03:27:15,010
I guess maybe it,
it is medical term and now like,

4844
03:27:15,030 --> 03:27:16,470
but it wouldn't be one thing if they 
were like,

4845
03:27:16,860 --> 03:27:20,400
I have a few door friends and that's 
what they prefer to be called.

4846
03:27:20,401 --> 03:27:21,234
Like war ride it cause I've paid.
They don't like what did you say it in 

4847
03:27:26,040 --> 03:27:29,950
the mic?
Furries rule from I believe C K N c.

4848
03:27:30,760 --> 03:27:32,510
A n.
C a way to go.

4849
03:27:32,730 --> 03:27:35,030
I'm going to talk on Ethan's fancy mic 
wait ago.

4850
03:27:36,010 --> 03:27:37,890
Hey,
got,

4851
03:27:38,160 --> 03:27:40,080
what else?
We got 56,000

4852
03:27:40,081 --> 03:27:41,480
how are you feeling about the next 
round?

4853
03:27:41,510 --> 03:27:42,343
Yeah,

4854
03:27:42,660 --> 03:27:45,880
I just want to get it over with.
And your dog keeps licking my feet.

4855
03:27:47,740 --> 03:27:49,090
Oh,
I paid for one,

4856
03:27:49,091 --> 03:27:52,550
but all right.
Hooks ready up?

4857
03:27:52,980 --> 03:27:57,980
How many,
how many people on the donation check?

4858
03:27:58,320 --> 03:28:00,000
It's just throwing a dollar.
You know,

4859
03:28:00,001 --> 03:28:02,400
it's not that much to just answer this 
question.

4860
03:28:02,730 --> 03:28:03,563
How many people have paid to either 
write on joey or Ethan's face or for a 

4861
03:28:10,291 --> 03:28:13,500
song by Aussie and it's just kind of 
never happened?

4862
03:28:14,120 --> 03:28:15,360
That's a great question.
Yes.

4863
03:28:15,550 --> 03:28:19,000
Oh yeah.
I feel really bad that I'm,

4864
03:28:20,090 --> 03:28:21,850
we're,
we're working through them right now.

4865
03:28:21,890 --> 03:28:22,421
Oh,
okay.

4866
03:28:22,421 --> 03:28:22,931
Okay.
Okay.

4867
03:28:22,931 --> 03:28:23,950
Sorry,
I just,

4868
03:28:23,951 --> 03:28:25,990
I just,
I don't know if it's tilted by or,

4869
03:28:25,991 --> 03:28:26,720
or,

4870
03:28:26,720 --> 03:28:28,530
um,
that was from,

4871
03:28:28,560 --> 03:28:32,590
we've got tube charts.
Dot Net [inaudible] dot net,

4872
03:28:32,940 --> 03:28:35,160
which is from tube charts.net.
Oh Wow.

4873
03:28:35,610 --> 03:28:36,443
What is tube charts and styles go to two
charts down that it's not like I'm a 

4874
03:28:41,131 --> 03:28:41,964
little afraid to go check.
And then we've got at s squared is from 

4875
03:28:47,470 --> 03:28:48,303
I from Ihg.
I guess big money is getting involved 

4876
03:28:51,540 --> 03:28:53,260
here.
Um,

4877
03:28:53,820 --> 03:28:54,690
uh,
Moses,

4878
03:28:54,691 --> 03:28:58,260
can you come hook shredding up with some
food or treats or something?

4879
03:28:59,460 --> 03:29:01,000
You should read it on the front.
It's not again,

4880
03:29:01,350 --> 03:29:03,660
you can start over.
Yeah,

4881
03:29:03,720 --> 03:29:05,820
I've been asked to draw something in 
Justin's style.

4882
03:29:06,510 --> 03:29:08,220
Justin,
don't be offended if I fuck it up.

4883
03:29:08,510 --> 03:29:09,750
Oh,
nobody's watching the feed.

4884
03:29:09,751 --> 03:29:10,584
You ask them a really important question
and now nobody's watching and they just 

4885
03:29:13,381 --> 03:29:14,214
donated more money.
I can't watch if people had donated in 

4886
03:29:21,781 --> 03:29:22,614
vain.

4887
03:29:24,880 --> 03:29:26,460
Oh my God.
Not My mouth.

4888
03:29:26,530 --> 03:29:30,660
Mitchell stashed there.
What did you,

4889
03:29:30,661 --> 03:29:31,494
uh,
right.

4890
03:29:33,210 --> 03:29:33,991
Okay.
Thank you.

4891
03:29:33,991 --> 03:29:37,940
In my mouth as well.
Straight.

4892
03:29:38,310 --> 03:29:40,770
Go get joey.
You're up next.

4893
03:29:40,800 --> 03:29:43,980
You look like kind of crushed joey.
Your stomach.

4894
03:29:43,981 --> 03:29:44,814
All right.
And you can't eat pizza cause you're on 

4895
03:29:47,431 --> 03:29:49,290
a diet.
Now tell me,

4896
03:29:49,310 --> 03:29:49,760
uh,
can you,

4897
03:29:49,760 --> 03:29:52,530
uh,
give joey the Michaela now tell me about

4898
03:29:52,531 --> 03:29:54,960
your diet,
if you would a why are you dieting?

4899
03:29:55,430 --> 03:29:56,910
Um,
I was training for the fight.

4900
03:29:57,420 --> 03:30:00,510
Yes.
So that's why I'm just kidding.

4901
03:30:00,630 --> 03:30:03,420
Binom I'm doing not well no,
that's a fair point.

4902
03:30:03,421 --> 03:30:07,140
We were going to have this battle meme 
royale and it was supposed to happen,

4903
03:30:07,141 --> 03:30:07,974
but um,
we had a production company looking at 

4904
03:30:09,631 --> 03:30:11,700
and they just straight up ghosted us,
which is strange.

4905
03:30:12,240 --> 03:30:13,073
When I was trying to train,
I was doing the Quito cause I want her 

4906
03:30:14,771 --> 03:30:19,110
to look ripped and uh,
I mean I'm back on it now.

4907
03:30:19,470 --> 03:30:22,560
Hopefully the fight eventually happens,
but like I,

4908
03:30:22,590 --> 03:30:23,423
I've been,
I was training hard every morning for a 

4909
03:30:25,041 --> 03:30:25,874
while and then I slowly stopped.
You stopped just because I didn't know 

4910
03:30:29,761 --> 03:30:31,920
what was happening.
It's too much work now.

4911
03:30:31,921 --> 03:30:33,330
Are you,
are you interested in fitness?

4912
03:30:33,331 --> 03:30:35,270
You're trying to get jack to,
um,

4913
03:30:35,280 --> 03:30:40,130
read what this says.
So we just got furries rule

4914
03:30:40,130 --> 03:30:44,980
once more and we also got race.
Oh Wow.

4915
03:30:45,370 --> 03:30:46,670
You have it.
Not True.

4916
03:30:46,671 --> 03:30:48,340
That was no.
Oh,

4917
03:30:48,350 --> 03:30:50,970
there's no a race.
Baiter hey man,

4918
03:30:53,300 --> 03:30:55,340
that's great.
Congratulations.

4919
03:30:55,400 --> 03:30:58,540
What else is left?
Thank you for your donation bag.

4920
03:31:00,790 --> 03:31:01,623
Topic topic.

4921
03:31:03,910 --> 03:31:06,400
Thank you Mitchell.
Now Joey,

4922
03:31:06,401 --> 03:31:07,234
are you,
you were had a significant other last I 

4923
03:31:09,401 --> 03:31:10,720
saw you.
Is that still going on?

4924
03:31:10,990 --> 03:31:12,070
Not,
not that one new one.

4925
03:31:12,280 --> 03:31:13,630
Oh No.
On what happened with the last one?

4926
03:31:13,631 --> 03:31:14,680
Seemed like you guys were hitting it 
off.

4927
03:31:15,310 --> 03:31:17,350
I don't remember.
We broke up like a year ago.

4928
03:31:17,380 --> 03:31:19,240
Where were you guys living together?
It seemed real serious.

4929
03:31:19,270 --> 03:31:21,570
No,
she was just over every day.

4930
03:31:22,240 --> 03:31:23,830
And so the new one,
tell me about her.

4931
03:31:23,860 --> 03:31:28,610
This new one or do you guys making like 
a facebook page that you guys had a hope

4932
03:31:28,620 --> 03:31:30,760
that prank channels?
Facebook doesn't,

4933
03:31:30,761 --> 03:31:32,680
let me change the name of the page.
It's ready.

4934
03:31:34,110 --> 03:31:35,290
It's done.
You're done.

4935
03:31:35,580 --> 03:31:37,420
All right.
And what was the new one?

4936
03:31:37,570 --> 03:31:38,403
The new one.
Her name's actually Gila or what's the 

4937
03:31:39,821 --> 03:31:40,654
new?
A little sharpie subscribed to lab coat 

4938
03:31:43,860 --> 03:31:44,693
and toppy the topic.
Can you say that into the mic once more 

4939
03:31:48,610 --> 03:31:51,220
subscribed,
a lab coat and toppy the topic.

4940
03:31:51,250 --> 03:31:52,083
Thank you guys.

4941
03:31:53,410 --> 03:31:55,180
Hey,
I mean it's moving slowly.

4942
03:31:55,181 --> 03:31:56,380
We're going to be here all fricking 
night.

4943
03:31:56,400 --> 03:31:58,660
Bus 57,000.

4944
03:31:59,220 --> 03:32:00,220
So wait,
listen to this.

4945
03:32:00,310 --> 03:32:02,320
The new ground scene,
she's half black,

4946
03:32:02,321 --> 03:32:04,690
half Jewish.
So I'm very exotic.

4947
03:32:04,720 --> 03:32:06,490
They can't call me a racist Nazi no 
more.

4948
03:32:07,090 --> 03:32:08,440
Is that why you were with her?
Yup.

4949
03:32:09,030 --> 03:32:10,720
Covered everything.
I don't care at all about her.

4950
03:32:10,721 --> 03:32:13,000
I just need a date or for like a week.
How long have you guys been together?

4951
03:32:13,750 --> 03:32:15,330
A couple of months.
Yep.

4952
03:32:15,550 --> 03:32:17,560
And does she sympathize with your 
political beliefs?

4953
03:32:18,520 --> 03:32:19,001
Yeah,
I'm red.

4954
03:32:19,001 --> 03:32:20,690
Pilling are a little bit,
hmm.

4955
03:32:22,170 --> 03:32:23,003
Is it red is red pilling um,
do you find it strange that this whole 

4956
03:32:28,181 --> 03:32:30,910
movement is based around a matrix 
metaphor?

4957
03:32:32,680 --> 03:32:34,990
I think that's kind of cool.
It's a little Corny,

4958
03:32:34,991 --> 03:32:35,824
isn't it?
But it's an easy way to like put it 

4959
03:32:37,940 --> 03:32:38,773
know.
And do you think that being enlightened 

4960
03:32:39,971 --> 03:32:42,460
red pill is,
is like as if Morpheus,

4961
03:32:42,461 --> 03:32:45,580
we're giving you the option to blue or 
red?

4962
03:32:45,610 --> 03:32:48,500
I don't think it's that serious.
It's not that serious.

4963
03:32:49,000 --> 03:32:49,833
Okay.

4964
03:32:51,030 --> 03:32:51,863
Okay.

4965
03:32:52,020 --> 03:32:52,853
Do,
what's the difference between woken red 

4966
03:32:54,651 --> 03:32:57,320
pilled?
I think they're the exact opposite.

4967
03:32:57,321 --> 03:32:58,610
Right?
It's like,

4968
03:32:58,860 --> 03:33:01,700
depends on what side you're on.
That's what woke means,

4969
03:33:01,940 --> 03:33:02,930
you know what I mean?
So it's like,

4970
03:33:02,931 --> 03:33:03,950
oh,
you can be woke.

4971
03:33:04,280 --> 03:33:07,220
But it's like you can also be on the 
left or you going to be woke and you can

4972
03:33:07,221 --> 03:33:09,590
be on the right.
It depends on what you're woke to.

4973
03:33:09,650 --> 03:33:12,770
So red building woke,
does it mean the same thing?

4974
03:33:13,310 --> 03:33:14,530
It depends what side you're on.

4975
03:33:14,910 --> 03:33:15,743
I've attempted to draw,
do a drawing and Justin royal and style 

4976
03:33:18,720 --> 03:33:19,553
way as close as I can to something that 
might look like adjusting oil and 

4977
03:33:22,051 --> 03:33:22,380
drawing.
Oh,

4978
03:33:22,380 --> 03:33:23,213
let's see.
Let me hold.

4979
03:33:23,650 --> 03:33:25,530
Let me hold it here.
And I ain't got the fake,

4980
03:33:25,560 --> 03:33:26,610
uh,
saying,

4981
03:33:27,090 --> 03:33:28,170
Hey folks,
I'm Mister Malora.

4982
03:33:28,200 --> 03:33:29,940
So I'm an original character.
I'm scared of dying.

4983
03:33:29,941 --> 03:33:31,020
That's my gimmick.
That's my thing.

4984
03:33:31,021 --> 03:33:32,370
I'm really scared.
We should all be scared.

4985
03:33:32,620 --> 03:33:34,770
And this mouth is saying number three,
bro.

4986
03:33:34,771 --> 03:33:36,150
I'm less scared letting up,
bro.

4987
03:33:37,230 --> 03:33:38,430
Do.
We've got a new official,

4988
03:33:38,430 --> 03:33:40,410
just character.
Alex.

4989
03:33:40,411 --> 03:33:41,820
Don't,
don't let Justin know.

4990
03:33:43,170 --> 03:33:44,910
Alex,
it looks pretty plausible.

4991
03:33:45,400 --> 03:33:50,400
Think I'm going to do a second careers.
Maybe it's close as I could remember it.

4992
03:33:50,541 --> 03:33:51,374
Uh,
what he's,

4993
03:33:51,540 --> 03:33:52,373
what his signature looks like.
I know there's curling reuland original 

4994
03:33:55,201 --> 03:33:59,330
by Alex now he needs to do it.
Alex was original by Justin Roiling.

4995
03:33:59,350 --> 03:34:01,620
I'd be curious to see.
I'd be curious to see what it would look

4996
03:34:01,621 --> 03:34:02,454
like.
I'm hoping they make mark that somebody 

4997
03:34:04,621 --> 03:34:08,260
can take straight out.
He's getting a little restless now.

4998
03:34:08,340 --> 03:34:10,280
There's more pizza.
There should be a lot more pizza.

4999
03:34:10,340 --> 03:34:11,790
It's a fuels.
My drawings ma'am.

5000
03:34:11,791 --> 03:34:14,040
So we're at 57,000
guys,

5001
03:34:14,400 --> 03:34:17,970
let me tell y'all this.
This day is getting long.

5002
03:34:18,360 --> 03:34:20,520
I mean,
here's $57,000

5003
03:34:20,850 --> 03:34:23,690
there's a lot of money we shouldn't,
we shouldn't be a,

5004
03:34:23,700 --> 03:34:26,940
you know,
this isn't chop liver here needs 75 are,

5005
03:34:26,941 --> 03:34:29,190
we're all stuck here.
That's true you guys.

5006
03:34:29,190 --> 03:34:30,023
We are physically a contractually.
We're unable to leave until this guy 

5007
03:34:34,411 --> 03:34:37,410
pukes ups and peppers unfortunately puke
and shit.

5008
03:34:37,411 --> 03:34:38,244
And I mean those are the,
how long does this stream lesson four 

5009
03:34:39,750 --> 03:34:43,650
never would get to a hundred there is no
end because we can be here for 24 hours.

5010
03:34:43,680 --> 03:34:46,590
If it takes that long to get 75 I'll be 
right back.

5011
03:34:47,310 --> 03:34:50,520
I think we'd all be happy ending on 75.
I think that 75 is good,

5012
03:34:51,120 --> 03:34:54,360
but we can do is if we get 100,000
off stream,

5013
03:34:54,361 --> 03:34:55,194
maybe we can just,
we'll get a widget thousand offers room 

5014
03:34:57,871 --> 03:34:58,960
for sure,
but I'll,

5015
03:34:58,980 --> 03:35:02,270
I'll eat the reaper for like another 
broadcast or something real there.

5016
03:35:03,630 --> 03:35:06,270
That's pretty amazing because I forget 
what we're doing.

5017
03:35:06,271 --> 03:35:08,320
A recap on Friday.
Hey are we live?

5018
03:35:08,520 --> 03:35:10,730
And I think we'll hit it before then.
Hey,

5019
03:35:12,630 --> 03:35:13,463
I could take one of them back with me to
New York and then I could just do it 

5020
03:35:15,601 --> 03:35:15,900
though.

5021
03:35:15,900 --> 03:35:17,670
That's awesome.
Can you maybe save this for,

5022
03:35:17,671 --> 03:35:20,250
uh,
you know when we're done you guys,

5023
03:35:20,251 --> 03:35:22,650
uh,
your defeatist fucking like I'll do,

5024
03:35:22,651 --> 03:35:25,360
I'll figure out how to do it then we'll 
share defeat.

5025
03:35:25,410 --> 03:35:27,240
It's happening tonight.
All right.

5026
03:35:27,450 --> 03:35:29,580
Everyone share it on their twitter right
now.

5027
03:35:29,581 --> 03:35:31,000
Just,
just share the everyone.

5028
03:35:31,010 --> 03:35:32,750
Okay.
Did you see Alex's,

5029
03:35:32,790 --> 03:35:33,760
uh,
Justin?

5030
03:35:34,560 --> 03:35:37,170
Somebody has adjust and reuland style 
drawing.

5031
03:35:37,180 --> 03:35:38,610
This looks great.
Oh my God,

5032
03:35:38,611 --> 03:35:39,444
this is so consistent advice.
Very close to what I would actually 

5033
03:35:42,691 --> 03:35:44,280
draw.
Now,

5034
03:35:44,281 --> 03:35:45,810
do you have notes?
What would you have done differently?

5035
03:35:46,320 --> 03:35:48,510
How do I make this more like a justin 
royal and drawing?

5036
03:35:49,110 --> 03:35:51,810
What are like the telltale giveaways for
like an art curator?

5037
03:35:53,190 --> 03:35:54,030
Wow.
No,

5038
03:35:54,100 --> 03:35:56,730
I mean you really,
this is a,

5039
03:35:56,731 --> 03:36:00,000
this is pretty dead on.
Justin is kinda shocked here.

5040
03:36:00,030 --> 03:36:01,920
I think a,
I think it might be out of business.

5041
03:36:03,210 --> 03:36:04,500
What about,
what about the signature?

5042
03:36:04,500 --> 03:36:06,450
What are the telltale mistakes in the 
signature?

5043
03:36:07,050 --> 03:36:10,440
The signature is a shit show,
but everything else is like they,

5044
03:36:10,441 --> 03:36:12,900
the handwriting and signature of the or 
the or the,

5045
03:36:13,410 --> 03:36:15,340
that character is like,
like if,

5046
03:36:15,860 --> 03:36:20,160
if like if I put that in a drawer and 
like a few years later I would not even,

5047
03:36:20,370 --> 03:36:23,530
I wouldn't just assume I drew it.
That's pretty amazing.

5048
03:36:25,080 --> 03:36:27,290
Are you going to draw a,
you going to draw an Alex Harris drawing

5049
03:36:27,300 --> 03:36:28,690
now?
Are you going to try to talk the world?

5050
03:36:29,160 --> 03:36:31,110
I'm not the chameleon of artists.
You know,

5051
03:36:31,260 --> 03:36:33,240
just like I'm not the chameleon of voice
actors.

5052
03:36:33,420 --> 03:36:36,070
Should we go over the reward 
impressionism

5053
03:36:37,420 --> 03:36:38,253
impression?
Do we need to tell these people what's 

5054
03:36:39,551 --> 03:36:40,384
at stake here guys?
We really are trying to help $500 

5055
03:36:44,920 --> 03:36:47,670
people.
Oh no sir.

5056
03:36:47,850 --> 03:36:48,683
A hundred bucks.
That's all it cost to draw to deface 

5057
03:36:50,081 --> 03:36:53,350
Joey's face,
500 to face my face.

5058
03:36:53,510 --> 03:36:55,870
Those were not,
those were down for a while,

5059
03:36:56,240 --> 03:36:57,700
right?
Or or what?

5060
03:36:57,701 --> 03:37:00,760
I mean it's up now.
We figured out what it was actually.

5061
03:37:01,150 --> 03:37:05,620
So we originally thought we were only 
going to six and we didn't want those to

5062
03:37:05,621 --> 03:37:09,490
go after and so they had expired and so 
I just,

5063
03:37:09,880 --> 03:37:12,490
I just reinitiated them and I said it to
eight,

5064
03:37:12,520 --> 03:37:14,380
but if we get close to eight and we're 
still going,

5065
03:37:14,790 --> 03:37:19,150
oh you got to keep going and half hours 
we got,

5066
03:37:19,151 --> 03:37:20,920
we got,
we got to go to at least seven hours.

5067
03:37:21,010 --> 03:37:23,810
I mean we did five hours last year,
so we still have an hour and a half,

5068
03:37:23,811 --> 03:37:25,090
but we definitely get to thousand.

5069
03:37:25,900 --> 03:37:28,970
We're not that close to 75 though.
No,

5070
03:37:28,971 --> 03:37:31,480
we got to hit,
we got to hit a Christmas miracle.

5071
03:37:32,200 --> 03:37:33,550
You know what it was,
you know what it was?

5072
03:37:33,551 --> 03:37:36,910
It was my fault for building that 
fucking toy in the beginning.

5073
03:37:38,110 --> 03:37:38,943
I wasn't contributing.
I wasn't like given the given the show 

5074
03:37:41,531 --> 03:37:43,660
the energy not too late Bro.
For game changing.

5075
03:37:43,661 --> 03:37:44,980
Prank call.
That's all I'm saying.

5076
03:37:45,070 --> 03:37:46,330
Who can we prank?
No,

5077
03:37:46,331 --> 03:37:50,680
so the law is as long as we call someone
outside of California,

5078
03:37:51,360 --> 03:37:52,193
it was also recording.
Some states have a one party consent 

5079
03:37:55,090 --> 03:37:58,570
call enzymes,
which up out I was like,

5080
03:37:58,680 --> 03:38:01,930
well we can call it enzyme.
We can call like scammers.

5081
03:38:01,931 --> 03:38:04,930
I mean let's call it,
let's do some print color.

5082
03:38:05,140 --> 03:38:10,140
Let's call it scammer.
Like cash for gold people or a role.

5083
03:38:10,530 --> 03:38:12,150
This is legitimate company.
No,

5084
03:38:12,151 --> 03:38:17,151
but if you go on Google and type like 
type something like how to send money to

5085
03:38:18,221 --> 03:38:20,800
my grandchild and click one of the ads.

5086
03:38:20,880 --> 03:38:23,480
Oh it was like a straight up scammer.
Yeah.

5087
03:38:24,070 --> 03:38:26,890
I don't know if we'll do it as good as 
like some of these other ones like,

5088
03:38:27,790 --> 03:38:30,850
well why don't you guys recommend some 
people that we don't have to feel guilty

5089
03:38:30,851 --> 03:38:32,200
about Pradco.
Are there any,

5090
03:38:32,201 --> 03:38:33,034
are there any guilt free frank calls?
If you could give us some suggestions 

5091
03:38:34,841 --> 03:38:37,150
from the donation spot cause we would 
love to,

5092
03:38:37,151 --> 03:38:39,640
frank calls him the dollars.
I'm like no.

5093
03:38:39,641 --> 03:38:41,860
Karma.
Karma points docked on us.

5094
03:38:41,970 --> 03:38:44,280
Yeah,
we got a call from the president of the,

5095
03:38:44,340 --> 03:38:45,430
yeah.
What's going on with that,

5096
03:38:45,431 --> 03:38:46,490
Dan?
Where's the park?

5097
03:38:46,491 --> 03:38:48,030
We president.
I heard we were going to,

5098
03:38:48,031 --> 03:38:53,031
and we'll get a call from Donald Trump.
Me Check my text messages.

5099
03:38:54,971 --> 03:38:58,030
Just cause I'm in tight with the,
I'm going to fight with the president.

5100
03:38:58,900 --> 03:39:00,820
Let me ask you a bunch of questions for 
the president.

5101
03:39:00,821 --> 03:39:01,960
Donald,
are you ready?

5102
03:39:02,120 --> 03:39:02,980
Yeah,
hold on.

5103
03:39:03,160 --> 03:39:05,920
Will you let me sort of like talk to the
president when he's on?

5104
03:39:05,921 --> 03:39:07,180
Yeah.
Yes,

5105
03:39:07,210 --> 03:39:08,170
absolutely.
I mean,

5106
03:39:08,171 --> 03:39:09,470
that's why we're doing this.
I thought,

5107
03:39:10,030 --> 03:39:12,550
I specifically thought that you would 
have a lot to,

5108
03:39:12,551 --> 03:39:15,100
a lot of questions for the president 
that I think are like,

5109
03:39:15,280 --> 03:39:16,113
you know,
important and I would love just an 

5110
03:39:19,211 --> 03:39:20,044
opportunity of like an uninterrupted 
little moment for me to ask some of 

5111
03:39:22,961 --> 03:39:25,750
those questions.
Can I use that?

5112
03:39:26,790 --> 03:39:28,630
Oh,

after taking out the hood and duct 
system.

5138
03:40:28,850 --> 03:40:32,720
Suspect is now in custody,
no word on his condition or possible.

5139
03:40:32,870 --> 03:40:34,750
Do you know what?

could just correct to the name.

5195
03:42:31,230 --> 03:42:33,540
What's his name?
His correct name is c,

5213
03:43:09,700 --> 03:43:12,280
is a little difficult.

Want Pepperoni or like by backwards?
Is there just cheese?

5217
03:43:18,400 --> 03:43:19,370

5220
03:43:24,951 --> 03:43:26,240
voice.
If you donate $1,000,

5221
03:43:26,270 --> 03:43:27,350
oh,
I 100% would do it,

5222
03:43:27,351 --> 03:43:29,930
but doesn't seem super reluctant to do 
the ric voice right now.

5223
03:43:30,110 --> 03:43:32,940
Maybe it busts his throat up,
but yeah,

This is very thrilling and very 
exciting.

5287
03:45:56,620 --> 03:45:58,530
Um,
little known fact.

5288
03:45:58,531 --> 03:46:01,440
I am very close and tight with the 
president of the United States.

5289
03:46:01,441 --> 03:46:03,480
Donald Trump.
Good old friends.

5290
03:46:03,780 --> 03:46:05,070
We go way back,
way,

5291
03:46:05,071 --> 03:46:05,904
way back.
You went to my bar Mitzvah and 

5292
03:46:07,291 --> 03:46:09,190
everything.
Um,

5293
03:46:09,240 --> 03:46:14,240
grabbed my mom by the pussy but that was
fine because he's such a superstar.

5294
03:46:15,590 --> 03:46:16,590
Um,
is he there?

5295
03:46:16,591 --> 03:46:17,424
I don't hear him but he decided to call 
us in to help donate for the cause is 

5296
03:46:21,781 --> 03:46:24,450
wonderful cause and to do an Faq with 
us.

5297
03:46:24,451 --> 03:46:25,284
So he is piping in right now.
The secret service is establishing a 

5298
03:46:28,801 --> 03:46:33,801
connection and it should only be a 
matter of moments now,

5299
03:46:34,560 --> 03:46:36,720
shortly before Donald Trump

5300
03:46:38,100 --> 03:46:38,933
zipped right in so many really like 
super important questions to ask 

5301
03:46:42,391 --> 03:46:44,100
residents.
What kind of buried the lead.

5302
03:46:44,101 --> 03:46:44,934
I mean it just says Alex version and 
Justin Reuland has guests and we kind 

5303
03:46:47,091 --> 03:46:47,611
of,
I know,

5304
03:46:47,611 --> 03:46:48,444
I downplayed it.

5305
03:46:48,660 --> 03:46:50,320
Just wanted it to be surprised.
And it is.

5306
03:46:50,560 --> 03:46:55,560
So without further ado and coming up 
very shortly,

5307
03:46:56,320 --> 03:47:00,100

5342
03:48:32,140 --> 03:48:32,973
Nope.

5343
03:48:33,670 --> 03:48:34,470
Hello.

5344
03:48:34,470 --> 03:48:36,150
Oh my God.
Oh my goodness.

5345
03:48:36,151 --> 03:48:38,030
What a honor to be.
I think guys were joking.

5346
03:48:38,040 --> 03:48:39,570
We get some precedent music.
Please.

5347
03:48:39,750 --> 03:48:41,850
Thank you.
The music down.

5348
03:48:41,880 --> 03:48:44,610
He's the president is to quiet music is 
still out.

5349
03:48:47,350 --> 03:48:51,390
I can't hear.
Interesting.

5350
03:48:51,730 --> 03:48:53,880
Mr President,
is anybody back there?

5351
03:48:53,900 --> 03:48:57,120
We turn them up.
Stop talking over him.

5352
03:48:57,720 --> 03:49:00,750
Yeah.
Well the music is pretty loud.

5353
03:49:01,500 --> 03:49:03,200
It's an honor to have you here.
I,

5354
03:49:03,330 --> 03:49:05,610
I had a few questions that,
uh,

5355
03:49:06,030 --> 03:49:07,140
I think,
you know,

5356
03:49:07,530 --> 03:49:11,220
the larger populous would,
would really like you to answer.

5357
03:49:11,400 --> 03:49:14,520
And I answered them honestly.
Um,

5358
03:49:15,290 --> 03:49:16,530
what do you,
what do you think about that?

5359
03:49:18,030 --> 03:49:19,230
Oh,
that's all right.

5360
03:49:19,231 --> 03:49:21,890
We'll do it.
I think whatever of life that took it,

5361
03:49:22,130 --> 03:49:24,110
nobody will do it.
But go ahead.

5362
03:49:24,760 --> 03:49:25,600
All right,
so,

5363
03:49:25,630 --> 03:49:29,950
so the first question I have is what do 
you think of slender man?

5364
03:49:30,760 --> 03:49:32,580
That whole,
that crazy cooky.

5365
03:49:33,050 --> 03:49:33,491
Oh,
you know,

5366
03:49:33,491 --> 03:49:37,030
there's so many complicated things to do
with others,

5367
03:49:37,110 --> 03:49:42,110
but it's true that this person got to,
Alli sent through,

5368
03:49:42,951 --> 03:49:47,160
we don't talk weight.
We tried to throw a fit.

5369
03:49:48,130 --> 03:49:48,963
That's probably,
but first what we will see static and 

5370
03:49:56,381 --> 03:49:58,000
that's that good.
So we're looking at today,

5371
03:49:59,380 --> 03:50:04,380
I've got my cup.
I said,

5372
03:50:05,500 --> 03:50:06,333
yes,

5373
03:50:07,560 --> 03:50:08,393
Mr President.
It's clear you have a strong opinion on 

5374
03:50:11,311 --> 03:50:14,880
a lot to say about slenderman.
We didn't,

5375
03:50:14,970 --> 03:50:16,940
we didn't quite hear most of it,
but I,

5376
03:50:16,941 --> 03:50:20,640
I hope the audience out out there 
watching the screen and see on Air Force

5377
03:50:20,641 --> 03:50:21,910
One right now.
President,

5378
03:50:22,010 --> 03:50:24,300
are you on Air Force One or what's going
on here?

5379
03:50:25,400 --> 03:50:30,150
We are totally bobby.
All of the countries worldwide initially

5380
03:50:30,170 --> 03:50:31,790
started.
It's total chaos.

5381
03:50:32,050 --> 03:50:32,883
Hmm.
Well,

5382
03:50:33,500 --> 03:50:34,333
well as it,
as interesting as that line of 

5383
03:50:36,681 --> 03:50:37,730
discussion might be,
I,

5384
03:50:37,731 --> 03:50:38,564
I'm,
I'm actually more curious to know what 

5385
03:50:40,521 --> 03:50:44,140
do you think of these Weird Nintendo?
You know,

5386
03:50:44,210 --> 03:50:46,580
Nintendo just sent out these little 
like,

5387
03:50:46,640 --> 03:50:47,473
you know,
original nes game pads that kind of 

5388
03:50:49,371 --> 03:50:51,660
slide into the side of your,
your,

5389
03:50:51,680 --> 03:50:54,110
your switch system.
You know what I'm talking about?

5390
03:50:54,111 --> 03:50:54,944
They just,
they just recently sent those out and 

5391
03:50:55,821 --> 03:50:57,250
you had to,
in order to get them,

5392
03:50:57,430 --> 03:50:58,263
well,
just what she's doing started with the 

5393
03:50:59,021 --> 03:51:03,180
company as long as you rest,
but you're looking at Mario and you look

5394
03:51:03,181 --> 03:51:08,181
at least gets you out of bed the whole 
day and it doesn't make any sense.

5395
03:51:08,620 --> 03:51:10,380
Okay.
I little,

5396
03:51:10,420 --> 03:51:11,710
I look at Barrio,
I say,

5397
03:51:11,711 --> 03:51:13,300
what is he?
It doesn't make sense.

5398
03:51:13,301 --> 03:51:14,800
Why does he want to be a bit?
Okay.

5399
03:51:14,801 --> 03:51:18,520
But they are totally fairly,
from what I understand,

5400
03:51:18,550 --> 03:51:19,383
you see,
you get it.

5401
03:51:19,570 --> 03:51:22,090
It's family and May in the dumpster.
Okay.

5402
03:51:23,230 --> 03:51:26,610
What you should really invest it is new 
soldier boy cut.

5403
03:51:26,620 --> 03:51:28,530
So that's what the body is dead.
I kill you.

5404
03:51:29,010 --> 03:51:29,461
Yeah,
I have,

5405
03:51:29,461 --> 03:51:30,294
I've been hearing,
I've been hearing good things about the 

5406
03:51:31,291 --> 03:51:33,330
soldier boy console,
so that's a really good thing.

5407
03:51:33,840 --> 03:51:34,560
Um,
what,

5408
03:51:34,560 --> 03:51:35,860
do you know what,
yeah,

5409
03:51:35,910 --> 03:51:36,840
sorry,
sorry to interrupt.

5410
03:51:36,870 --> 03:51:37,350
I know.
Uh,

5411
03:51:37,350 --> 03:51:37,951
what,
what do you,

5412
03:51:37,951 --> 03:51:40,230
what do you think about the,
the um,

5413
03:51:40,980 --> 03:51:42,090
this whole,
uh,

5414
03:51:42,091 --> 03:51:43,530
you know,
uh,

5415
03:51:43,680 --> 03:51:44,513
uh,
digital streaming channel that lets you 

5416
03:51:45,991 --> 03:51:47,520
watch nickelodeon

5417
03:51:48,030 --> 03:51:48,863
depo her and,
and they are both really the Boogie 

5418
03:51:50,370 --> 03:51:53,410
board vote people in or what to did you 
bond?

5419
03:51:53,860 --> 03:51:55,150
They stripped out Jeff,
three,

5420
03:51:55,151 --> 03:51:57,050
four,
five up to five days.

5421
03:51:57,051 --> 03:52:02,051
So you have a evolution.
So that's something we liked but we have

5422
03:52:03,581 --> 03:52:04,414
to look at Yoga.

5423
03:52:05,280 --> 03:52:07,020
Mr President,
I just have to ask,

5424
03:52:07,021 --> 03:52:07,860
you know,
you brought up,

5425
03:52:07,861 --> 03:52:09,330
did you mind um,
you know,

5426
03:52:09,331 --> 03:52:12,270
Michael Huckabee is famously come out so
that he doesn't believe in,

5427
03:52:12,330 --> 03:52:13,110
uh,
did you,

5428
03:52:13,110 --> 03:52:14,400
did you,
did you evolution,

5429
03:52:14,430 --> 03:52:15,263
uh,
he doesn't believe that.

5430
03:52:15,270 --> 03:52:16,900
Uh,
did your mind can ditch evolve?

5431
03:52:17,100 --> 03:52:19,020
What is your,
what is your take on that Mr President?

5432
03:52:20,240 --> 03:52:24,540
I think if you put shit people compared 
to a get you by Roy Taylor then,

5433
03:52:24,570 --> 03:52:27,330
which I think if I have to be right,
it's totally about get be a puppy,

5434
03:52:27,340 --> 03:52:29,270
be what gives it,
did you post right?

5435
03:52:29,271 --> 03:52:30,104
You get of through the circuits.
I said you would be a very different 

5436
03:52:33,321 --> 03:52:34,154
story.

5437
03:52:36,190 --> 03:52:37,021
Yeah,
that's the,

5438
03:52:37,021 --> 03:52:38,680
that's a pretty,
I mean,

5439
03:52:38,710 --> 03:52:39,910
I can't disagree with that.

5440
03:52:39,950 --> 03:52:42,170
No.
Mr President,

5441
03:52:42,320 --> 03:52:43,153
as you all know,
the power rangers was a very popular 

5442
03:52:46,101 --> 03:52:51,101
show and the 90s now a lot of people say
the pink power ranger was,

5443
03:52:51,640 --> 03:52:53,240
it was the most powerful,
but I,

5444
03:52:53,330 --> 03:52:56,500
but many also say the red power ranger 
was the most powerful.

5445
03:52:57,570 --> 03:52:58,403
Yeah.
You were looking at the power rangers 

5446
03:52:59,690 --> 03:53:02,780
and the black one was black.
I don't know what was going on there,

5447
03:53:02,781 --> 03:53:06,200
but it was just total dictatorship.
I don't really talk about it,

5448
03:53:06,201 --> 03:53:07,380
but text off.
Yay.

5449
03:53:07,670 --> 03:53:08,503
Go ahead.

5450
03:53:11,060 --> 03:53:12,270
Um,
uh,

5451
03:53:12,740 --> 03:53:15,230
w what do you think of Japanese candies?
I mean,

5452
03:53:15,231 --> 03:53:16,064
are you,
are you familiar with these little 

5453
03:53:17,511 --> 03:53:17,800
monkeys?

5454
03:53:17,800 --> 03:53:19,830
Sure.
You look at Japanese women and they look

5455
03:53:19,831 --> 03:53:21,810
a little bit younger than the rest of 
the world.

5456
03:53:21,811 --> 03:53:22,550
Right.
That joke yet.

5457
03:53:22,550 --> 03:53:23,383
But it's legal and the whole thing is 
legal and they say the people go there 

5458
03:53:26,791 --> 03:53:30,080
to get a white people go to give hand 
because of the way every,

5459
03:53:30,160 --> 03:53:32,700
I show younger than six fit because of 
like white guys.

5460
03:53:32,701 --> 03:53:34,450
But that's the case,
so.

5461
03:53:36,810 --> 03:53:37,490
Okay.

5462
03:53:37,490 --> 03:53:39,090
But Mr President,
what do you think about the,

5463
03:53:39,140 --> 03:53:39,973
the treats,
the Japanese treats like the pokey or 

5464
03:53:42,860 --> 03:53:46,970
Paki Hello Panda Panda.
You know some of these mushroom shaped a

5465
03:53:46,971 --> 03:53:49,820
little chocolate.
Three avoiding the question.

5466
03:53:49,940 --> 03:53:52,670
Romney's soda.
How do you feel about the light full?

5467
03:53:52,760 --> 03:53:53,890
Avoiding.
Avoiding both.

5468
03:53:54,100 --> 03:53:56,120
We could just judge you how you see 
yourself.

5469
03:53:56,800 --> 03:53:59,010
You people put this fake stuff.
Okay.

5470
03:53:59,020 --> 03:54:00,580
But this is what the truth is.
Okay.

5471
03:54:00,581 --> 03:54:05,581
I'm telling you it is okay.
I am totally cool.

5472
03:54:06,131 --> 03:54:08,450
Why?
I love the animation epic.

5473
03:54:08,470 --> 03:54:09,610
Okay.
That's what I love.

5474
03:54:09,670 --> 03:54:11,020
Okay.
I keep telling you people,

5475
03:54:11,021 --> 03:54:13,290
but they would print it like you beside 
your [inaudible].

5476
03:54:13,400 --> 03:54:17,680
So I've sat though,
I love Japanese culture.

5477
03:54:17,681 --> 03:54:19,660
I love the pictures.
Right?

5478
03:54:19,690 --> 03:54:22,820
The contracts that was present.
Mr Braden,

5479
03:54:23,220 --> 03:54:25,180
as I have super powers.
Ed,

5480
03:54:25,380 --> 03:54:26,950
I see pizza.
I say it's crazy.

5481
03:54:26,951 --> 03:54:27,430
Okay.

5482
03:54:27,430 --> 03:54:31,230
Now Mister President,
do you consume a Hentai?

5483
03:54:31,240 --> 03:54:34,360
What do you think that Hentai it should 
be illegal.

5484
03:54:34,361 --> 03:54:35,194
I know a lot of Hentai depicts very 
young girls in it and a lot of people 

5485
03:54:39,911 --> 03:54:41,320
find that question.
What do you,

5486
03:54:41,321 --> 03:54:44,410
what do you think about this type of 
Hentai that depicts very young girls?

5487
03:54:44,411 --> 03:54:45,244
Mr President.

5488
03:54:46,050 --> 03:54:48,690
Well,
I was sitting there and I never heard of

5489
03:54:48,691 --> 03:54:49,290
this.
I said,

5490
03:54:49,290 --> 03:54:52,940
how did it all by people?
What am I tap?

5491
03:54:52,941 --> 03:54:55,680
People came up to me and it shouldn't be
surprised.

5492
03:54:55,800 --> 03:54:57,720
What did you think of head size has ever
heard of it?

5493
03:54:58,420 --> 03:54:59,253
So they gave me a laptop with that guy.
He said the elders and they left me 

5494
03:55:03,211 --> 03:55:05,940
alone for third one out.
But you're looking at these pictures and

5495
03:55:05,941 --> 03:55:08,190
they're horrible.
And his knees.

5496
03:55:09,390 --> 03:55:10,500
I look,
girls look so young,

5497
03:55:10,560 --> 03:55:11,960
but they like it.
It's sort of like,

5498
03:55:12,440 --> 03:55:13,273
but that's okay.
We can talk about that because they are 

5499
03:55:14,941 --> 03:55:17,220
like it.
But you look at these authentic,

5500
03:55:17,221 --> 03:55:21,470
those fucking Webinar.
So weak Leo Speedo say this.

5501
03:55:21,510 --> 03:55:22,343
That's okay.

5502
03:55:22,490 --> 03:55:23,660
Um,
do you,

5503
03:55:23,930 --> 03:55:24,763
uh,
what was a really thought provoking 

5504
03:55:25,641 --> 03:55:26,141
answer?
Yeah,

5505
03:55:26,141 --> 03:55:27,350
that was going to answer like,
well,

5506
03:55:27,351 --> 03:55:28,910
what do you think?
What do you think of these?

5507
03:55:28,911 --> 03:55:29,840
Uh,
what do you think of these?

5508
03:55:29,841 --> 03:55:31,730
Like these,
these scooters,

5509
03:55:31,880 --> 03:55:35,210
lyme or bird,
all these companies,

5510
03:55:35,211 --> 03:55:36,530
these scooters and,
and,

5511
03:55:36,531 --> 03:55:38,540
and,
and what do you think about segway,

5512
03:55:39,020 --> 03:55:39,920
the segway pro.

5513
03:55:40,440 --> 03:55:41,360
Wait,
hold on.

5514
03:55:42,350 --> 03:55:45,010
Okay.
Okay.

5515
03:55:46,670 --> 03:55:48,110
I'm sorry.
You took video.

5516
03:55:48,430 --> 03:55:50,390
2 billion views.
Thinking there's 2 billion people.

5517
03:55:50,391 --> 03:55:53,050
That's a lot of people.
That's a lot of people killed,

5518
03:55:54,060 --> 03:55:58,010
but it has 2 million views.
I sorted edit with a little boy,

5519
03:55:58,070 --> 03:55:59,960
a little Mexican boy.
I,

5520
03:56:00,030 --> 03:56:02,750
we showed one of these scooters.
I said,

5521
03:56:02,751 --> 03:56:04,580
what is that?
But the little boy,

5522
03:56:04,581 --> 03:56:06,640
he falls off the scooter in the video.
Okay.

5523
03:56:08,660 --> 03:56:10,300
Yes.
Uh Huh.

5524
03:56:11,100 --> 03:56:11,933
Go ahead.

5525
03:56:15,310 --> 03:56:16,061
Okay.
Are you,

5526
03:56:16,061 --> 03:56:17,500
is that the,
so you're,

5527
03:56:17,501 --> 03:56:19,270
is that Mr President,
are you there?

5528
03:56:19,360 --> 03:56:21,190
Are you,
is that you saying?

5529
03:56:21,191 --> 03:56:21,380
Yeah.

5530
03:56:21,380 --> 03:56:22,213
Oh,
I really,

5531
03:56:22,450 --> 03:56:24,320
yes.
That was a little boy fell off the stool

5532
03:56:24,321 --> 03:56:24,950
and that's it.

5533
03:56:24,950 --> 03:56:28,810
Okay.
So,

5534
03:56:28,811 --> 03:56:29,591
so,
okay,

5535
03:56:29,591 --> 03:56:30,630
got it.
You're against them.

5536
03:56:30,700 --> 03:56:31,260
Um,
I'm,

5537
03:56:31,260 --> 03:56:32,860
I'm kind of curious,
Mr President,

5538
03:56:32,861 --> 03:56:34,450
who do you mean?
Maybe he's for them.

5539
03:56:34,451 --> 03:56:35,284
I,
yeah,

5540
03:56:35,290 --> 03:56:40,120
not quite clearly dodging the Co.
I think the president wants to move on

5541
03:56:41,370 --> 03:56:42,203
the little boy,
the [inaudible] the four simple than I 

5542
03:56:46,891 --> 03:56:48,510
am.
Maybe you take things typically,

5543
03:56:48,511 --> 03:56:49,650
I just know,
pick up,

5544
03:56:50,670 --> 03:56:51,503
look at the little boy.
And once you see that video you'll just 

5545
03:56:53,591 --> 03:56:54,390
stared.
Okay.

5546
03:56:54,390 --> 03:56:55,400
Mr President,
what,

5547
03:56:55,880 --> 03:56:56,713
what's your take on Mario paint?
The classic Mario Paint for Nintendo 

5548
03:57:01,220 --> 03:57:02,510
Super Nintendo.
Do you think it should be remade?

5549
03:57:02,511 --> 03:57:04,730
Do you think there should be a modern,
more,

5550
03:57:04,760 --> 03:57:05,870
more featured,
uh,

5551
03:57:05,880 --> 03:57:07,190
uh,
more features,

5552
03:57:07,191 --> 03:57:08,930
more fleshed out version of Mario paint?

5553
03:57:09,100 --> 03:57:09,933
Hmm.
Barrio be released for the switch 2019 

5554
03:57:13,281 --> 03:57:16,010
and then there was easily 20.
Thank you Lord.

5555
03:57:16,100 --> 03:57:16,930
Okay.
That's,

5556
03:57:16,930 --> 03:57:17,960
is that a basis?

5557
03:57:18,180 --> 03:57:18,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

5558
03:57:18,960 --> 03:57:21,420
Can I ask who do you mean and smash?
Mr Who?

5559
03:57:21,421 --> 03:57:22,254
Who,
who do you mean when you play smash 

5560
03:57:22,911 --> 03:57:24,290
brothers against other world leaders?
Yeah.

5561
03:57:25,400 --> 03:57:28,340
Where are you looking at?
You're looking at what you gave is right

5562
03:57:28,341 --> 03:57:31,380
there.
There's all these killings doesn't sell,

5563
03:57:31,430 --> 03:57:32,960
but that's just,
okay.

5564
03:57:33,440 --> 03:57:37,890
But I saw somebody playing the scale by 
playing the game.

5565
03:57:38,570 --> 03:57:39,640
They should be on.
What is that?

5566
03:57:39,830 --> 03:57:40,361
He said,
dad,

5567
03:57:40,361 --> 03:57:41,061
don't look.
I said,

5568
03:57:41,061 --> 03:57:46,061
what is that edge?
I realized that Super Smash Brothers was

5569
03:57:46,131 --> 03:57:47,390
epic.
I looked at word right.

5570
03:57:47,391 --> 03:57:48,230
If you've heard of this,

5571
03:57:50,770 --> 03:57:52,220
we have heard of the word man.

5572
03:57:53,030 --> 03:57:54,690
It gets fucking sweet.
Lowest,

5573
03:57:54,691 --> 03:57:55,710
every religious great,
right?

5574
03:57:55,711 --> 03:57:57,600
This is what we'd like to talk about.
But,

5575
03:57:58,120 --> 03:58:00,830
so I saw his very far.
They shared my thoughts with this.

5576
03:58:01,470 --> 03:58:03,010
I don't get it.
There's all these gay,

5577
03:58:03,300 --> 03:58:05,000
they're fighting.
That's what's,

5578
03:58:05,060 --> 03:58:06,060
what's with the fighting

5579
03:58:07,040 --> 03:58:08,920
you're,
you're saying you'd like to see a,

5580
03:58:09,010 --> 03:58:10,710
a more peaceful,
uh,

5581
03:58:10,711 --> 03:58:11,730
a version of

5582
03:58:12,990 --> 03:58:13,823
Oh,
smash brothers.

5583
03:58:14,750 --> 03:58:19,750
The situation with all the kids so that 
we will get into that.

5584
03:58:20,490 --> 03:58:23,580
But you're looking at bowery [inaudible]
Gel dot.

5585
03:58:23,581 --> 03:58:25,140
Okay.
And it's so great.

5586
03:58:25,650 --> 03:58:26,640
It's so cool.

5587
03:58:27,760 --> 03:58:28,900
Now,
Mr President,

5588
03:58:28,901 --> 03:58:30,490
what is a,
what is done?

5589
03:58:30,760 --> 03:58:33,550
What do you think about?
So when you think of the game,

5590
03:58:33,580 --> 03:58:35,180
Zelda,
the,

5591
03:58:35,190 --> 03:58:39,730
the main protagonist,
the hero of that game is link actually.

5592
03:58:39,731 --> 03:58:43,720
But a lot of people think that it's 
Zelda because the name is Zola,

5593
03:58:43,721 --> 03:58:45,460
but that's the name of the princess.
Now,

5594
03:58:45,461 --> 03:58:46,294
do you think that this name,
that this game should be called the 

5595
03:58:48,551 --> 03:58:49,384
adventures of link?
Do you find that that the way that it's 

5596
03:58:51,191 --> 03:58:52,570
branded is inappropriate?

5597
03:58:52,680 --> 03:58:56,070
I talked to get totally this lady.
I say it should be happy.

5598
03:58:56,080 --> 03:58:58,180
Look to do,
we will be putting my copy both.

5599
03:58:58,190 --> 03:58:59,850
I would like to look at the public.
Not People.

5600
03:59:00,040 --> 03:59:01,620
You want to do it?
Your president.

5601
03:59:02,070 --> 03:59:02,903
Okay.

5602
03:59:05,500 --> 03:59:07,240
Uh,
yeah.

5603
03:59:07,420 --> 03:59:10,450
Um,
so what do you think of Bitcoins,

5604
03:59:10,460 --> 03:59:13,010
Mr President?
Are you a big fit coin guy?

5605
03:59:13,670 --> 03:59:15,100
He are.
You,

5606
03:59:15,610 --> 03:59:17,780
you buy a couple of bitcoins or what

5607
03:59:18,340 --> 03:59:20,660
though?
They per se do the Bitcoin,

5608
03:59:21,270 --> 03:59:22,103
they were second best.
The best of best did I looked at doing 

5609
03:59:24,100 --> 03:59:25,840
it.
It looks like a total fraud.

5610
03:59:25,841 --> 03:59:29,580
Just see what the stem,
I think anybody about bitcoin before the

5611
03:59:29,581 --> 03:59:30,900
crash is stupid.
That's okay.

5612
03:59:30,901 --> 03:59:34,860
We won't get it today.
But what I did was I invested heavily in

5613
03:59:34,920 --> 03:59:35,753
goats going judge.
Cause I could write babe of course 

5614
03:59:39,540 --> 03:59:40,373
thing.

5615
03:59:40,540 --> 03:59:43,120
Now Mr President,
if I can ask you something a little more

5616
03:59:43,121 --> 03:59:44,510
personal,
uh,

5617
03:59:44,530 --> 03:59:45,363
do you,
how do you wipe the Ed when you have a 

5618
03:59:47,680 --> 03:59:49,630
debt,
when you defecate in the bathroom,

5619
03:59:50,470 --> 03:59:53,020
do you end with a wet one?
Do you use baby wipes?

5620
03:59:53,021 --> 03:59:54,140
Do you have a,
um,

5621
03:59:54,360 --> 03:59:55,193
do they,
how do you clean up the feces around 

5622
03:59:56,741 --> 03:59:57,790
your,
your asshole,

5623
03:59:57,791 --> 03:59:58,890
Mr President after that

5624
04:00:00,490 --> 04:00:03,180
covered look at us and off the both 
feeling a certain way,

5625
04:00:03,181 --> 04:00:04,140
right?
A very good day.

5626
04:00:04,141 --> 04:00:06,730
I do that pretty much a bad day.
I just feel bad.

5627
04:00:06,731 --> 04:00:10,050
I should wear where you have two people 
come in and do it themselves.

5628
04:00:10,051 --> 04:00:11,670
But there's a lot of ways to do it 
right.

5629
04:00:11,671 --> 04:00:13,440
It's that great,
but there's a lot of ways.

5630
04:00:13,441 --> 04:00:14,274
That's right.

5631
04:00:15,270 --> 04:00:16,390
Well,
Mr President,

5632
04:00:16,391 --> 04:00:18,370
I have to say it's been very eye 
opening.

5633
04:00:18,371 --> 04:00:20,280
Uh,
you've dodged some questions,

5634
04:00:20,280 --> 04:00:22,470
but for the most part you've been very 
forthcoming.

5635
04:00:24,230 --> 04:00:26,870
Yes.
I love all of you people.

5636
04:00:26,871 --> 04:00:28,970
I think you're all great in sales.
I don't be,

5637
04:00:29,120 --> 04:00:30,910
you keep video,
get it shoved communities.

5638
04:00:30,920 --> 04:00:34,130
My favorite one of all,
I love this.

5639
04:00:34,250 --> 04:00:35,083
It's great.

5640
04:00:35,140 --> 04:00:36,340
Okay.
That's the president.

5641
04:00:36,341 --> 04:00:37,420
Well,
Eh,

5642
04:00:37,570 --> 04:00:38,171
gut.
Please.

5643
04:00:38,171 --> 04:00:40,480
Thank you for,
for all of your hard work.

5644
04:00:40,481 --> 04:00:43,950
I know that being depressed,
being done the hard work hard.

5645
04:00:44,740 --> 04:00:48,340
These are hard questions.
We held your feet to the fire today.

5646
04:00:48,341 --> 04:00:49,174
I really appreciate you really held,
you really like telling us the truthful 

5647
04:00:52,541 --> 04:00:54,730
answers to some of these hard questions 
that we,

5648
04:00:54,731 --> 04:00:58,460
that we,
we lobbed at you and we appreciate it.

5649
04:01:00,370 --> 04:01:02,410
But I have to tell you before I leave,
I have to tell you,

5650
04:01:02,930 --> 04:01:05,200
look up on Youtube.
Pitcher 40 do videos.

5651
04:01:05,201 --> 04:01:06,580
They calling it viral.
Okay,

5652
04:01:06,581 --> 04:01:07,414
that's probably fine.
But what they say to you is if you look 

5653
04:01:09,341 --> 04:01:14,170
on youtube and you type,
it was a funny,

5654
04:01:15,490 --> 04:01:16,323
it's still funny.
It's the funniest thing I've ever seen 

5655
04:01:18,611 --> 04:01:19,444
before.
Okay,

5656
04:01:19,460 --> 04:01:21,480
so you would just stay.
That's all I wanted to tell him.

5657
04:01:22,250 --> 04:01:23,083
Well,
I'm the president of the united well 

5658
04:01:25,601 --> 04:01:28,090
Mister President,
I'm sure you have a lot to get to.

5659
04:01:28,091 --> 04:01:29,950
You must be very busy,
man.

5660
04:01:30,430 --> 04:01:32,920
Um,
so we wish you all the best and uh,

5661
04:01:32,921 --> 04:01:35,980
good luck running the country and thank 
you so much for calling trouble,

5662
04:01:35,981 --> 04:01:37,120
Huh?
Yes,

5663
04:01:37,121 --> 04:01:37,720
absolutely.

5664
04:01:37,720 --> 04:01:38,920
All right.
Thank you very much.

5665
04:01:38,921 --> 04:01:40,270
Your ledger for peace out.

5666
04:01:41,350 --> 04:01:42,183
Hmm?

5667
04:01:44,140 --> 04:01:45,090
I don't know.

5668
04:01:45,880 --> 04:01:46,900
Yes,
of course.

5669
04:01:46,901 --> 04:01:47,734
Well,
did you say something about he did say 

5670
04:01:49,451 --> 04:01:51,280
yes,
he did ask him about all the,

5671
04:01:51,310 --> 04:01:52,930
all the aliens,
but I guess we missed our chance,

5672
04:01:52,931 --> 04:01:53,764
but we know about slapping man.
We could have really gotten into some 

5673
04:01:55,601 --> 04:01:57,290
CIA actual helpful thing.
I,

5674
04:01:57,291 --> 04:01:58,210
well maybe not.
I had,

5675
04:01:58,290 --> 04:01:59,123
yeah,
there was a lot of questions about 

5676
04:02:00,281 --> 04:02:02,250
policy and stuff.
Yeah,

5677
04:02:02,530 --> 04:02:04,080
I had written down but we never got 
there.

5678
04:02:04,081 --> 04:02:04,914
There's a lot of stuff,
but really want to know it was an area 

5679
04:02:06,371 --> 04:02:09,760
51 on next.
Well that was fascinating.

5680
04:02:09,840 --> 04:02:12,130
Yeah.
60,500

5681
04:02:12,131 --> 04:02:13,630

He got the trump bomb.

5682
04:02:14,110 --> 04:02:15,070
Trump bump.
Thank you.

5683
04:02:15,100 --> 04:02:16,910
Thank you Mr President for the bump 
15th.

5684
04:02:17,080 --> 04:02:18,100
Oh,
we got more to right.

5685
04:02:18,130 --> 04:02:19,860
So Dan,
do we have a Saturday?

5686
04:02:19,861 --> 04:02:21,140
We've got a song.
We've got a song,

5687
04:02:21,220 --> 04:02:23,740
a song by song time.
Yeah.

5688
04:02:23,741 --> 04:02:24,370
Let's,
uh,

5689
04:02:24,370 --> 04:02:26,320
let's go back and real quick,
can I show you I got,

5690
04:02:26,350 --> 04:02:30,280
I got another heart might full guys.

5691
04:02:31,650 --> 04:02:34,810
Whoa dude.
Alex,

5692
04:02:36,450 --> 04:02:41,290
let me show this quest.
Look at this.

5693
04:02:41,680 --> 04:02:46,680
See very talented artists.
Freaking kidding me.

5694
04:02:47,441 --> 04:02:50,940
You a little redder red.
They tread boy that I think.

5695
04:02:50,950 --> 04:02:52,330
I think I have.
I'm getting this.

5696
04:02:52,331 --> 04:02:55,330
I'm getting the vibe that maybe Ethan's 
going to try to snag that one.

5697
04:02:55,900 --> 04:02:58,160
I need to be maybe your bullshit.
Well,

5698
04:02:58,230 --> 04:02:59,830
what do you,
what art do you want to bid on?

5699
04:03:01,540 --> 04:03:02,830
Mom?
Is this the one you want?

5700
04:03:02,860 --> 04:03:07,480
Mama approved every mom on earth once 
that are made above for kitchen.

5701
04:03:07,481 --> 04:03:10,570
She wants that image.
500 500 to a,

5702
04:03:10,630 --> 04:03:13,960
I'm working on some random,
I could draw on him.

5703
04:03:14,050 --> 04:03:15,760
I don't know what.
Oh Jesus.

5704
04:03:15,761 --> 04:03:18,100
It's all that.
So was working on something spicy

5705
04:03:18,100 --> 04:03:19,390
and hot.
Okay,

5706
04:03:20,050 --> 04:03:21,370
here we gotta.
We gotta get,

5707
04:03:21,400 --> 04:03:22,750
we gotta get you.
Oh by the way,

5708
04:03:22,751 --> 04:03:24,430
take these out and you should all go up 
for auction.

5709
04:03:24,780 --> 04:03:26,650
The grease on them.
That's amazing.

5710
04:03:26,651 --> 04:03:29,650
Original or y'all better fucking bad to 
me and then is ready.

5711
04:03:29,651 --> 04:03:32,080
So let's get her in here to play.
Play player first driver.

5712
04:03:32,081 --> 04:03:32,914
Justin.
I feel like I'm being violated whenever 

5713
04:03:34,421 --> 04:03:37,670
Justin writes on me like look at this my
head,

5714
04:03:37,690 --> 04:03:42,610
it's a very personal thing like on a 
head back against my back.

5715
04:03:42,810 --> 04:03:43,643
Come on.
I'm looking up under him as if like the 

5716
04:03:46,931 --> 04:03:49,620
girls view and the blow job made me 
think,

5717
04:03:51,970 --> 04:03:54,100
Oh God,
what are you writing?

5718
04:03:54,750 --> 04:03:55,583
It's just so somebody asking to be sub

5721
04:04:08,080 --> 04:04:09,750
What a hero.
Well,

5722
04:04:09,760 --> 04:04:12,070
let me make sure that that's clear that 
that's a c.

5723
04:04:13,690 --> 04:04:14,530
Yeah,
there we go.

5724
04:04:14,531 --> 04:04:16,900
That was e k nine c right?
That was his name.

5725
04:04:18,380 --> 04:04:20,620
Nicey nicey.
No one else.

5726
04:04:22,380 --> 04:04:24,940
All right,
here we go.

5727
04:04:25,720 --> 04:04:27,640
Let's keep it going guys.
Let's keep it going.

5728
04:04:32,500 --> 04:04:36,700
This is already set up so,
all right.

5729
04:04:36,701 --> 04:04:38,770
Any moron.
Any more drawing requests,

5730
04:04:38,800 --> 04:04:41,280
drop them in.
Drop them in the truck by men to chat.

5731
04:04:41,550 --> 04:04:43,530
Let's bid on one of the drawings.
Which one he wants.

5732
04:04:43,560 --> 04:04:48,430
These get to 75.
Can we please get to 75 I like the first

5733
04:04:48,431 --> 04:04:51,970
one that Justin made stories up the 
three characters.

5734
04:04:52,270 --> 04:04:53,290
Okay.
Damn.

5735
04:04:53,500 --> 04:04:54,333
Oh,
you're here to here.

5736
04:04:55,980 --> 04:04:57,170
All right,
let's bid.

5737
04:04:57,910 --> 04:05:02,910
And these apparently let's bid.
Should I wait?

5738
04:05:04,120 --> 04:05:06,280
Should we bid 2000 on it?
I'm going to be pissed.

5739
04:05:06,281 --> 04:05:07,114
Maybe do it.
That wasn't on Alex's drawing of our 

5740
04:05:08,741 --> 04:05:10,180
baby.
That one was also,

5741
04:05:10,181 --> 04:05:12,810
yeah.
Do you really want to see that every day

5742
04:05:13,220 --> 04:05:15,680
then?
I want to see that in the paper.

5743
04:05:17,650 --> 04:05:21,880
How long is this?
Well first let's introduce our guests.

5744
04:05:22,260 --> 04:05:24,400
We have Aussie here from chaos,
chaos,

5745
04:05:24,670 --> 04:05:25,480
uh,
previous,

5746
04:05:25,480 --> 04:05:27,550
uh,
welcome back to the show by the way.

5747
04:05:27,580 --> 04:05:30,490
Yes,
we can see her.

5748
04:05:32,590 --> 04:05:33,610
Yeah,
you can move.

5749
04:05:33,850 --> 04:05:35,400
Oh my God.
My face is fuck.

5750
04:05:36,060 --> 04:05:39,690
I realized.
Yeah,

5751
04:05:39,760 --> 04:05:41,060
scoot that way.
Screwed that way.

5752
04:05:42,260 --> 04:05:45,780
So we have a performance.
What was the request for?

5753
04:05:45,830 --> 04:05:46,970
Let's say,
yeah,

5754
04:05:47,130 --> 04:05:49,270
Ossie.
Yeah,

5755
04:05:49,730 --> 04:05:53,400
you should just hear it,
but somebody donated.

5756
04:05:53,410 --> 04:05:55,600
Can we shout them out?
Yeah.

5757
04:05:56,500 --> 04:05:57,870
Okay.
All right.

5758
04:05:57,970 --> 04:05:59,970
So to do this right,
I have to,

5759
04:06:00,610 --> 04:06:02,680
I'm going to kill off your mics.
Okay.

5760
04:06:03,720 --> 04:06:04,553
Okay,
cool.

5761
04:06:08,960 --> 04:06:09,793
Yeah,

5762
04:06:10,940 --> 04:06:12,540
there's so many things that could go 
wrong with this.

5763
04:06:13,110 --> 04:06:13,580
All

5764
04:06:13,580 --> 04:06:14,413
right.

5765
04:06:19,640 --> 04:06:24,530
Uh,
uh,

5766
04:06:55,860 --> 04:07:00,860
yeah.
[inaudible] then for the charity.

5767
04:08:01,250 --> 04:08:04,600
Wow.
Keep and creepers never sounded so cool.

5768
04:08:05,680 --> 04:08:06,513
Is that going on your new album?
Are we are Mike's back on deep and 

5769
04:08:09,321 --> 04:08:10,760
creep,
peep and creep.

5770
04:08:10,880 --> 04:08:13,550
Oh my God,
I didn't know that was awesome.

5771
04:08:13,580 --> 04:08:15,230
So who is responsible?
Who?

5772
04:08:15,330 --> 04:08:15,921
Yeah.
Dan.

5773
04:08:15,921 --> 04:08:17,020
Who?
Who indeed.

5774
04:08:17,370 --> 04:08:19,470
I don't know who it was.
Dan.

5775
04:08:21,030 --> 04:08:22,980
Okay.
Was it you just told her?

5776
04:08:22,981 --> 04:08:24,930
I though I couldn't get through.
I swear to God,

5777
04:08:25,570 --> 04:08:28,480
be able to choose.
You definitely got to be able to choose.

5778
04:08:28,660 --> 04:08:29,493
I was trying to like get one in like 
every time I would try it with like 

5779
04:08:31,781 --> 04:08:32,614
another,
it would be a slot would be taken and 

5780
04:08:33,311 --> 04:08:34,144
then I'd try again.
That was a fan named Spencer that 

5781
04:08:36,011 --> 04:08:41,011
requested that.
Tell me,

5782
04:08:42,401 --> 04:08:46,870
I see you were backstage at rehearsing.
How was your preparation for that?

5783
04:08:47,160 --> 04:08:47,800
Um,
it was,

5784
04:08:47,800 --> 04:08:50,470
it was interesting up.
Do I need to talk in this mic?

5785
04:08:51,160 --> 04:08:52,890
You don't want to hear Mike's now that.
Oh,

5786
04:08:52,900 --> 04:08:53,733
okay.
Oh,

5787
04:08:54,040 --> 04:08:54,873
okay.
Yeah.

5788
04:08:55,280 --> 04:08:56,113
Okay.

5789
04:08:56,580 --> 04:08:57,413
Um,
all right.

5790
04:08:57,810 --> 04:08:59,130
Um,
it was interesting.

5791
04:08:59,131 --> 04:09:02,730
I was like sitting out in front of the 
bathroom and there was a guy,

5792
04:09:02,970 --> 04:09:03,803
actually,
he was kind of interesting with the 

5793
04:09:04,501 --> 04:09:05,334
context of the song,
but there was a guy walking around with 

5794
04:09:07,061 --> 04:09:09,170
the flashlight for some reason just like
shoot,

5795
04:09:09,180 --> 04:09:12,090
like shining a flashlight is puffin and 
creeping.

5796
04:09:12,120 --> 04:09:13,780
And he was explaining on me,

5797
04:09:14,310 --> 04:09:16,710
I don't know,
is that normal around the building?

5798
04:09:17,310 --> 04:09:18,780
Oh,
that definitely,

5799
04:09:18,781 --> 04:09:20,130
that happened the whole time.
And I was like,

5800
04:09:20,131 --> 04:09:24,070
you're a while you're playing.
People think so.

5801
04:09:24,730 --> 04:09:28,600
I think what it was like for him,
mommy,

5802
04:09:29,470 --> 04:09:32,910
Justin dresses up as a security guard 
and walks around with a flashlight.

5803
04:09:32,911 --> 04:09:33,744
It was not me guys.
You guys would know that there's going 

5804
04:09:35,961 --> 04:09:39,060
to be some like really rational reason 
why that was happening.

5805
04:09:40,920 --> 04:09:45,630
Building.
But he died and he was like,

5806
04:09:47,850 --> 04:09:50,460
we called them flashlight,
flashlight on.

5807
04:09:50,461 --> 04:09:53,280
You did,
he was already doing it.

5808
04:09:53,430 --> 04:09:54,263
He was doing it before I got there.
And then and then kind of like continue 

5809
04:09:57,471 --> 04:09:59,860
to know why I should have just chose a 
different location.

5810
04:10:00,490 --> 04:10:03,090
I am.
I sat like right next to him.

5811
04:10:04,330 --> 04:10:05,910
You can,
you can do them right in this room.

5812
04:10:05,970 --> 04:10:07,680
So it seems like you probably want to 
be,

5813
04:10:07,690 --> 04:10:08,520
you can just do it.

5814
04:10:08,520 --> 04:10:09,630
Any song.
Right?

5815
04:10:09,631 --> 04:10:13,770
If you,
if you have a moment,

5816
04:10:13,771 --> 04:10:14,604
one of hers,
he's just not like sheet music for peep 

5817
04:10:17,231 --> 04:10:20,190
and creep is available on line listening
to it.

5818
04:10:21,230 --> 04:10:22,063
I was looking at your lyrics.
You bet you got three more to learn and 

5819
04:10:24,091 --> 04:10:24,924
come back in and play.
So I feel like I should leave on this 

5820
04:10:27,211 --> 04:10:28,270
note though.
But I know.

5821
04:10:28,630 --> 04:10:31,980
Learn the next good leave for good.
Just go out there.

5822
04:10:32,820 --> 04:10:35,100
How many songs should shit doing?
I should pay for one.

5823
04:10:35,640 --> 04:10:36,920
I know what's up.
I should get,

5824
04:10:37,000 --> 04:10:38,070
I should pay for a song.
I do.

5825
04:10:38,080 --> 04:10:39,640
I think we only thought we already 
capped yet.

5826
04:10:39,740 --> 04:10:43,140
Well it's like,
it's like once she gets through the next

5827
04:10:43,460 --> 04:10:45,830
we do or be popular.
So we put a cap of,

5828
04:10:45,840 --> 04:10:50,840
we only saw three or four.
Dan,

5829
04:10:51,480 --> 04:10:52,313
what did we sell those we sold for?
Because you've got to look at my $500 

5830
04:10:55,470 --> 04:10:57,990
donation that I did and that's copy 
that.

5831
04:10:57,990 --> 04:10:58,930
All right,
we'll take a look at that,

5832
04:10:58,940 --> 04:11:01,020
Justin.
I snuck around the barriers.

5833
04:11:01,760 --> 04:11:04,650
I have a song I want guys,
we're up to 61,000

5834
04:11:04,680 --> 04:11:05,910
we're getting close.
We're getting close.

5835
04:11:05,911 --> 04:11:07,710
Come on,
but it's going really slow.

5836
04:11:07,711 --> 04:11:08,720
Thank you.
Aussies,

5837
04:11:09,360 --> 04:11:11,160
aussies performance.
Just donate.

5838
04:11:11,190 --> 04:11:13,140
You know,
five bucks,

5839
04:11:13,141 --> 04:11:14,280
10 bucks,
whatever.

5840
04:11:15,210 --> 04:11:18,300
$80 you should get a shot of joey salads
sitting on the couch,

5841
04:11:18,301 --> 04:11:23,301
on his phone and let's see,
this one's got a shot at Joey Salads.

5842
04:11:27,571 --> 04:11:29,460
Please on the couch for Christ's sake.
Look,

5843
04:11:29,461 --> 04:11:31,020
and like,
I mean,

5844
04:11:31,050 --> 04:11:32,460
look at this guy.
He,

5845
04:11:32,820 --> 04:11:36,380
he probably doesn't even know like,
look at this.

5846
04:11:38,040 --> 04:11:39,420
Eat that pepper man.
He's like,

5847
04:11:39,421 --> 04:11:40,530
where's that pepper?
And he's like,

5848
04:11:40,531 --> 04:11:44,490
why?
Why are your fans so so,

5849
04:11:44,530 --> 04:11:48,420
so heartless that they can't even like 
think of these poor people?

5850
04:11:48,510 --> 04:11:51,660
Can we play some more sad videos?
Let's play some more sad videos.

5851
04:11:51,860 --> 04:11:54,010
Show up.
Fuck devastate.

5852
04:11:54,690 --> 04:11:55,523
Maybe that's what we need to do is to 
really using up tug at their heart 

5853
04:11:58,160 --> 04:11:59,820
strings.
I don't know,

5854
04:12:01,040 --> 04:12:04,230
maybe it was incredible.
That's creep.

5855
04:12:04,800 --> 04:12:07,140
Well let's pray called the psychic cause
we actually have,

5856
04:12:07,170 --> 04:12:08,003
okay,
let's do it.

5857
04:12:08,190 --> 04:12:09,720
Dan,
can we connect to the psychic?

5858
04:12:09,721 --> 04:12:11,950
I gave you a website.
Hollywood

5859
04:12:11,980 --> 04:12:13,860
psychics.com.
Yeah,

5860
04:12:13,910 --> 04:12:16,840
let's do it as long as your phone 
number.

5861
04:12:17,890 --> 04:12:20,290
Um,
Hollywood psycho.com

5862
04:12:21,820 --> 04:12:23,770
but I think we should do karaoke as 
well.

5863
04:12:25,420 --> 04:12:27,590
Hello?
Be Bank.

5864
04:12:27,591 --> 04:12:32,591
Greed will set you giuffre I don't 
remember the words be.

5865
04:12:35,130 --> 04:12:35,963
Do you want to sing it?
You know my throat P I can get glue 

5866
04:12:38,620 --> 04:12:39,580
helped me out.
How's it go?

5867
04:12:41,830 --> 04:12:45,380
You just be one person who just knew it.
Just,

5868
04:12:46,790 --> 04:12:47,910
yeah.

5869
04:12:48,160 --> 04:12:49,710
Oh,
hey Joe Greene.

5870
04:12:50,060 --> 04:12:53,390
The cuties at the beach.
The cuties at the,

5871
04:12:53,420 --> 04:12:54,051
yeah.
All right.

5872
04:12:54,051 --> 04:12:56,360
Enough.
If that fucking thing out of your face.

5873
04:12:57,010 --> 04:13:02,010
[inaudible] is this Mike actually 
picking up the vocals like Oh God.

5874
04:13:04,140 --> 04:13:05,190
Well on.
I'm just curious.

5875
04:13:05,250 --> 04:13:06,290
Hopefully not.
Oh No,

5876
04:13:06,330 --> 04:13:08,040
it's closed right now.
I mean we can,

5877
04:13:08,041 --> 04:13:10,170
we can hear it just from the ambiance a 
little bit,

5878
04:13:10,171 --> 04:13:14,310
but I wonder like was it too loud like 
it was,

5879
04:13:14,311 --> 04:13:16,560
it was her vocals were quiet in the 
room.

5880
04:13:16,620 --> 04:13:18,390
But I want,
but in the overall mix,

5881
04:13:18,391 --> 04:13:21,450
was it like if anything the vocals were 
yeah,

5882
04:13:21,600 --> 04:13:22,680
cause we don't,
we don't have,

5883
04:13:22,681 --> 04:13:25,380
we don't have her a keyboard Mike.
So what else we got here?

5884
04:13:25,680 --> 04:13:28,960
Vocals were way we may do.
I mean it was okay.

5885
04:13:30,410 --> 04:13:30,831
Okay.
Yeah,

5886
04:13:30,831 --> 04:13:31,200
yeah,
yeah.

5887
04:13:31,200 --> 04:13:33,180
There's no hard line in for the,
for the,

5888
04:13:33,210 --> 04:13:34,410
for the stupid,
uh Oh yeah.

5889
04:13:34,411 --> 04:13:35,760
What the fuck for that keyboard?

5890
04:13:35,930 --> 04:13:37,650
It's all good.
Hello?

5891
04:13:37,770 --> 04:13:41,160
Hello guys.
What the fuck is this?

5892
04:13:41,230 --> 04:13:43,890
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

5893
04:13:44,040 --> 04:13:46,620
61,000
we're going to be here a while.

5894
04:13:51,000 --> 04:13:53,100
So which one do you want to donate for?
Hey look,

5895
04:13:53,160 --> 04:13:54,750
we've,
how much have we donated so far?

5896
04:13:54,751 --> 04:13:59,550
3000 so let's drop another two.
Where do you want to put them?

5897
04:13:59,650 --> 04:14:02,640
He creep.
I'm on the drawing height,

5898
04:14:02,670 --> 04:14:03,361
by the way,
Ethan,

5899
04:14:03,361 --> 04:14:07,560
I think you should leave this raffle up 
for more than just a week.

5900
04:14:08,250 --> 04:14:10,080
We can't extend it.
I think you should.

5901
04:14:11,300 --> 04:14:12,510
Well,
we can always extend it.

5902
04:14:12,990 --> 04:14:14,190
And you know what,
I'll be the bad guy.

5903
04:14:14,191 --> 04:14:16,830
I'll take the bullet.
We're going to extend it for a month.

5904
04:14:17,310 --> 04:14:19,230
A month.
That's what we did last year.

5905
04:14:19,780 --> 04:14:20,910
Did we really?
Come on?

5906
04:14:20,911 --> 04:14:22,520
No,
I don't think it would matter.

5907
04:14:22,521 --> 04:14:25,140
I think it was two weeks.
We had three weeks.

5908
04:14:25,141 --> 04:14:28,230
We also got to get all the,
I say it's never let it end.

5909
04:14:28,290 --> 04:14:30,060
That's a lot of work.
The thing is,

5910
04:14:30,061 --> 04:14:31,880
I don't think they get the money until 
the campus.

5911
04:14:31,920 --> 04:14:32,753
No,
that's not true.

5912
04:14:32,970 --> 04:14:35,220
They get the money.
All these for us.

5913
04:14:35,221 --> 04:14:37,560
People are like waiting.
We just keep extending.

5914
04:14:39,640 --> 04:14:40,473
Um,

5915
04:14:41,130 --> 04:14:42,960
I want to create Paul.
I want to prank call,

5916
04:14:42,990 --> 04:14:45,090
but I'll tell you what guys.
No,

5917
04:14:45,091 --> 04:14:47,380
let's just call a psychic hotline.
Assigned me to prank calls.

5918
04:14:47,400 --> 04:14:49,220
Just those call a psyche.
Cause my prank,

5919

5922
04:14:58,080 --> 04:14:59,190
Well,

5923
04:14:59,250 --> 04:15:01,370

So patch us into the first one.

5924
04:15:01,390 --> 04:15:03,750
You Go pee all he this,

5926
04:15:06,841 --> 04:15:08,340

04:15:08,341 --> 04:15:09,174

5928
04:15:13,790 --> 04:15:16,340
he can put it in your mouth.
Joey wants to pee in my mouth.

5929
04:15:16,341 --> 04:15:17,174
I want to be in his mouth and somebody 
go grab some ginger beer like from the 

5930
04:15:21,260 --> 04:15:22,410
local.
Okay.

5931
04:15:22,640 --> 04:15:23,480
Down the street.

5932
04:15:23,480 --> 04:15:25,310
Liquor store.
They were the ones from ginger beer.

5933
04:15:25,460 --> 04:15:26,600
Oh,
I would kill for it.

5934
04:15:27,650 --> 04:15:30,140
I'll see what I can do.
You can just post mates.

5935
04:15:30,141 --> 04:15:32,620
It's a known as to go to a porsche or 
you can send somebody to do it.

5936
04:15:33,080 --> 04:15:34,250
Let me know somebody.
Postmates it.

5937
04:15:34,251 --> 04:15:36,050
I'm afraid to do it on my phone.
Don't worry.

5938
04:15:36,051 --> 04:15:39,080
We got it.
And why is I'm broke.

5939
04:15:39,250 --> 04:15:40,083
Yeah,

I'll pay whoever it is.

5941
04:15:43,221 --> 04:15:44,600
Okay,

5942
04:15:44,601 --> 04:15:46,500

Ooh,

5943
04:15:46,690 --> 04:15:50,270
but people,

5945
04:15:55,401 --> 04:15:56,234
Okay,

And then do you want to put another 
thousand on another drawing?

5947
04:15:58,851 --> 04:16:01,500
Ila One.
Do One.

5948
04:16:02,240 --> 04:16:03,073
I don't remember.
I remember there was ones I really 

5949
04:16:04,071 --> 04:16:04,790
liked,
but I don't,

5950
04:16:04,790 --> 04:16:06,440
let me look on the rewards

5951
04:16:07,010 --> 04:16:07,843
thing.

5952
04:16:08,800 --> 04:16:09,281
Yeah,
I got it.

5953
04:16:09,281 --> 04:16:10,480
I got to donate.
So man,

5954
04:16:10,481 --> 04:16:12,550
I got to drop down a big donation.
Let's see.

5955
04:16:12,700 --> 04:16:14,140
A big boy.
Big Boy.

5956
04:16:14,160 --> 04:16:14,993
Yeah,
you've got to get to 75 k because let's 

5957
04:16:16,571 --> 04:16:17,404
see which thing do I want the most?
So maybe I'm just going to try to get 

5958
04:16:20,441 --> 04:16:24,910
that morty Chia pet.
You lose to the one taller.

5959
04:16:25,910 --> 04:16:27,990
It dropped three k for the morning.
Chia pet.

5960
04:16:28,840 --> 04:16:30,280
Hilarious.
And you still lost.

5961
04:16:31,390 --> 04:16:33,160
Okay,
so I have worse all the art.

5962
04:16:36,050 --> 04:16:39,810
I feel like it's too dark.
You can't see the Goddamn Shit.

5963
04:16:39,830 --> 04:16:41,840
I'm mobile.
I see as like a muddy,

5964
04:16:43,190 --> 04:16:45,260
muddy wall of,
of of things.

5965
04:16:45,261 --> 04:16:46,940
I can't see it.
And like $1,

5966
04:16:46,941 --> 04:16:47,930
$1,
$1.

5967
04:16:47,931 --> 04:16:48,764
And it's either Justin's baby Klein,
there's a little vote you wanted a baby 

5968
04:16:51,700 --> 04:16:56,700
klein that rick and morty crew zip up 
Hoodie.

5969
04:16:57,440 --> 04:17:02,440
That is legitimately fucking crazy.
Crazy.

5970
04:17:02,661 --> 04:17:03,770
Fucking rare.
Rare,

5971
04:17:03,771 --> 04:17:05,870
valuable.
That's like crew only.

5972
04:17:05,871 --> 04:17:07,640
And if you look at it,
can you click on zoom?

5973
04:17:07,730 --> 04:17:08,780
Like,
can you get a bigger,

5974
04:17:08,820 --> 04:17:10,730
I can one sec.
Wait,

5975
04:17:10,731 --> 04:17:12,720
do you get to like what do you have to 
open up a special arc?

5976
04:17:12,740 --> 04:17:15,860
Like can you do it through till to fi 
really here.

5977
04:17:15,861 --> 04:17:17,730
Actually here.
Okay.

5978
04:17:17,900 --> 04:17:19,430
Here we go.
Fucking for Christ sake.

5979
04:17:19,940 --> 04:17:20,810
So,
so,

5980
04:17:20,811 --> 04:17:21,644
so like these are all like all the 
drawings are from the original doc and 

5981
04:17:26,241 --> 04:17:27,340
Marty Short,
right?

5982
04:17:27,600 --> 04:17:30,230
That got this whole thing started and 
um,

5983
04:17:30,410 --> 04:17:31,243
I added some new ones for the interior 
hoodie and this is by daylight curfew 

5984
04:17:34,550 --> 04:17:36,320
and um,
there's not,

5985
04:17:36,380 --> 04:17:36,941
I mean I'm,
I'm,

5986
04:17:36,941 --> 04:17:38,300
I'm not shitting around.
There's like,

5987
04:17:38,420 --> 04:17:40,520
there's like,
I'm not shitting around guys.

5988
04:17:40,640 --> 04:17:43,670
I know that varies.
That's a famous spray familiar with,

5989
04:17:44,040 --> 04:17:46,570
there's like maybe a hundred of these 
total made.

5990
04:17:47,060 --> 04:17:48,770
Um,
so you know,

5991
04:17:48,771 --> 04:17:50,300
if you're looking at,
if you're looking to,

5992
04:17:50,360 --> 04:17:52,750
if you're looking for bitcoin style 
investments,

5993
04:17:52,910 --> 04:17:53,870
well,
and then if,

5994
04:17:53,871 --> 04:17:55,400
I dunno if you want to pitch this a 
little,

5995
04:17:55,450 --> 04:17:57,770
but this,
this is worth 100,000,

5996
04:17:57,771 --> 04:17:58,604
I think.

5997
04:18:00,500 --> 04:18:01,333
But it is like,
it's literally priceless because there 

5998
04:18:03,351 --> 04:18:05,930
aren't any,
there aren't any more of that.

5999
04:18:05,931 --> 04:18:06,764
Yeah.
There's no way.

6000
04:18:06,890 --> 04:18:07,940
There's,
there's nothing one of the

6001
04:18:08,050 --> 04:18:08,883
Bible,
but it's also one of a kind because 

6002
04:18:11,370 --> 04:18:12,001
it's,
it's,

6003
04:18:12,001 --> 04:18:12,834
it's the first one ever.
It's the test print with mistakes that 

6004
04:18:16,810 --> 04:18:18,360
you like.
There's some like there's some,

6005
04:18:18,420 --> 04:18:19,253
I think there's some typos in there.
There's some slight differences between 

6006
04:18:21,061 --> 04:18:22,730
the final version dude guys.
Oh,

6007
04:18:22,740 --> 04:18:23,850
also by the way,
you should,

6008
04:18:23,880 --> 04:18:24,713
you should in the front cover of that.
You should write down like all of that 

6009
04:18:28,381 --> 04:18:29,980
information's in the bush.
Sure.

6010
04:18:30,140 --> 04:18:30,973
Yeah,
because that will really fucking like 

6011
04:18:32,551 --> 04:18:34,350
authentic,
authentic,

6012
04:18:34,360 --> 04:18:36,210
utilize it and if the winter wants it 
signed,

6013
04:18:36,211 --> 04:18:37,470
I'll sign it.
If they don't want it signed,

6014
04:18:37,471 --> 04:18:38,790
I won't sign it,
but I'll find go back.

6015
04:18:39,130 --> 04:18:39,590
Wait,
Dan,

6016
04:18:39,590 --> 04:18:43,210
did you already donate a thousand?
I was actually just filling it out.

6017
04:18:43,300 --> 04:18:44,011
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

6018
04:18:44,011 --> 04:18:45,210
Okay.
Stopping please.

6019
04:18:45,211 --> 04:18:47,220
For the love of God,
do 1,200

6020
04:18:47,221 --> 04:18:48,780
so I can bump this guy.
No,

6021
04:18:51,030 --> 04:18:52,140
I want the bump him.

6022
04:18:52,170 --> 04:18:53,760
He's had it all day.
You know what?

6023
04:18:53,761 --> 04:18:55,260
You're right.
I think you've got to bump it.

6024
04:18:55,710 --> 04:18:59,070
A real person has to bump at night yet.
No bumpers person.

6025
04:18:59,670 --> 04:19:02,040
I'm a real person.
I'm donating to directly.

6026
04:19:02,041 --> 04:19:03,750
You bump it.
Bump your bump.

6027
04:19:03,800 --> 04:19:04,340
Yeah,
you go,

6028
04:19:04,340 --> 04:19:05,700
this is how it works.
Poppers,

6029
04:19:05,710 --> 04:19:09,030
competition,
game 1,200

6030
04:19:09,600 --> 04:19:12,220
being no,
because they do it.

6031
04:19:12,240 --> 04:19:12,841
They're going to be like,

6032
04:19:12,841 --> 04:19:13,980
well then I'm out.
No,

6033
04:19:13,981 --> 04:19:14,814
they're going to bump me.
You have a guy or girl out there who's 

6034
04:19:17,430 --> 04:19:20,250
going to be like,
I'm going to bump a whitmore phillips.

6035
04:19:20,400 --> 04:19:23,280
I only put a hundred above him.
It's a total bumper bowl bid.

6036
04:19:23,310 --> 04:19:25,140
What other fun stuff do we have here?
We got,

6037
04:19:25,141 --> 04:19:26,610
we got,
we get saggy.

6038
04:19:26,611 --> 04:19:27,331
Is this the one?
Yeah,

6039
04:19:27,331 --> 04:19:28,080
this one.
Yeah.

6040
04:19:28,080 --> 04:19:28,930
That's the way.
No,

6041
04:19:28,931 --> 04:19:29,191
no,
no,

6042
04:19:29,191 --> 04:19:30,300
not this one.
Not this one.

6043
04:19:30,780 --> 04:19:31,571
Look at though.
The sack.

6044
04:19:31,571 --> 04:19:32,404
You asked for the hugging it out is what
we called it is looking at three guns 

6045
04:19:35,421 --> 04:19:35,730
right there.

6046
04:19:35,730 --> 04:19:37,170
Right there.
Bam.

6047
04:19:37,171 --> 04:19:38,670
There you go.
To 1,200

6048
04:19:38,671 --> 04:19:39,750
on hugging.
Oh my God.

6049
04:19:39,780 --> 04:19:40,620
Well,
I colored it.

6050
04:19:40,800 --> 04:19:42,570
I want that one.
I colored that one.

6051
04:19:42,571 --> 04:19:45,300
Should I put 2000 on this one?
Well,

6052
04:19:45,301 --> 04:19:49,110
I mean don't,
don't do all this.

6053
04:19:49,111 --> 04:19:49,944
Art will be framed when it shipped.
It's going to be put in really nice 

6054
04:19:52,771 --> 04:19:53,700
frame.
Holy Shit.

6055
04:19:53,701 --> 04:19:56,670
I really hope I win this.
Justin,

6056
04:19:56,671 --> 04:19:58,590
can you just make 1,200
here we go.

6057
04:19:59,150 --> 04:19:59,983
How can you just draw me something?
Just kind of like football pushing on 

6058
04:20:03,691 --> 04:20:04,524
this guy in the middle.
None of them look like they're enjoying 

6059
04:20:05,971 --> 04:20:08,130
themselves.
They all look like they're in pain.

6060
04:20:08,131 --> 04:20:10,650
The guy in the middle does with the 
other two look like they're in pain.

6061
04:20:10,660 --> 04:20:12,830
I should put 5,000
for a video from Ross.

6062
04:20:13,860 --> 04:20:14,560
Yeah.
How,

6063
04:20:14,560 --> 04:20:17,340
how are we doing with the,
with the Ros one or I guess we don't,

6064
04:20:17,341 --> 04:20:18,450
we have no fucking clue.

6065
04:20:18,450 --> 04:20:19,980
Right?
Well Dan does have,

6066
04:20:20,010 --> 04:20:21,900
um,
well we we should,

6067
04:20:21,901 --> 04:20:24,510
we should not know that that information
cause that that'll,

6068
04:20:24,511 --> 04:20:26,310
that'll totally wait.
What does that Mr.

6069
04:20:26,310 --> 04:20:28,950
Moore Mo oh that's [inaudible] I did 
look at that.

6070
04:20:29,220 --> 04:20:30,053
Wait,
click on this cause the cause like it 

6071
04:20:31,381 --> 04:20:32,214
says,
look,

6072
04:20:32,560 --> 04:20:34,050
it'll Justin Roy.
Oh my God.

6073
04:20:34,520 --> 04:20:35,353
It's not by me.
It needs to explain it that original 

6074
04:20:40,930 --> 04:20:45,930
cause otherwise and you actually need to
sign them your own way.

6075
04:20:47,880 --> 04:20:50,050
We'll edit the title right now.
Yeah.

6076
04:20:51,300 --> 04:20:53,310
I want to see that one bump around in 
such a good job.

6077
04:20:53,320 --> 04:20:55,300
Imitating,
look,

6078
04:20:55,320 --> 04:20:55,940
believe me,
I,

6079
04:20:55,940 --> 04:20:57,990
I said the same thing.
I was like,

6080
04:20:57,991 --> 04:21:00,510
oh my God,
I needed more saggy pendulous breasts.

6081
04:21:00,530 --> 04:21:01,363
Oh guys.
You know what I'm going to do while 

6082
04:21:03,991 --> 04:21:06,190
we're waiting for,
you know,

6083
04:21:06,190 --> 04:21:07,023
all kinds of fun and,
and I think the next video that Ethan's 

6084
04:21:09,341 --> 04:21:10,174
going to pull up,
I'm going to go ahead and build a 

6085
04:21:11,921 --> 04:21:13,570
skateboard.
Ooh.

6086
04:21:13,600 --> 04:21:16,180
That we're going to put up for auction,
but before we build it,

6087
04:21:17,500 --> 04:21:20,470
we're going to draw something on Joey.
Like,

6088
04:21:20,620 --> 04:21:22,810
should I buy like a 10 things to write 
on Jelly?

6089
04:21:23,350 --> 04:21:24,183
Yeah,
I think so.

6090
04:21:26,200 --> 04:21:29,110
Can I?
I want to write 10 things to write on,

6091
04:21:29,111 --> 04:21:33,730
Joey.
That's six things here.

6092
04:21:33,790 --> 04:21:35,320
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to donate.

6093
04:21:36,070 --> 04:21:39,810
What?
Can you bring a tent?

6094
04:21:39,950 --> 04:21:40,783
Yeah,
of course.

6095
04:21:41,110 --> 04:21:41,943
If I donate $1,000,
can I draw a huge penis on Joey's face 

6096
04:21:45,251 --> 04:21:47,620
where the balls are over his eyes and 
the peanut.

6097
04:21:47,630 --> 04:21:50,770
I want Justin to do it,
but the balls are on his forehead and go

6098
04:21:50,771 --> 04:21:51,604
all the way.
Let me just send him in so you can ask 

6099
04:21:52,640 --> 04:21:54,760
him.
All right guys.

6100
04:21:54,760 --> 04:21:56,560
So I'm gonna,
I'm gonna,

6101
04:21:56,561 --> 04:21:58,570
I'm gonna make a skateboard that I would
ride.

6102
04:21:59,460 --> 04:22:04,460
I don't know if you guys can see this is
signed by Paul Rodriguez at the top.

6103
04:22:06,370 --> 04:22:08,680
Can you see this real quick?
This is signed by Paul Rodriguez.

6104
04:22:08,710 --> 04:22:10,940
Rodriguez.
He's a fucking bad ass skate boarders.

6105
04:22:11,330 --> 04:22:14,430
Where the fuck have you been joe?
So Joe,

6106
04:22:14,431 --> 04:22:15,264

6107
04:22:18,461 --> 04:22:22,330
your face where the balls are each above
and then all the way down?

6108
04:22:22,560 --> 04:22:23,710
Well,
you got a beard on though.

6109
04:22:23,740 --> 04:22:25,930
I would say do it for,
just do it.

6110
04:22:26,170 --> 04:22:27,250
Okay.

6112
04:22:27,550 --> 04:22:29,310
I'm not doing anymore.
You know,

6113
04:22:29,320 --> 04:22:30,153
I always,
I was walking to the bedroom before and 

6114
04:22:31,790 --> 04:22:32,860
I'm just walking around.
I'm like,

6115
04:22:32,861 --> 04:22:35,410
why the fuck is everyone looking at me?
Yeah,

6116
04:22:35,420 --> 04:22:36,570
no,
I go into the bed now.

6117
04:22:36,610 --> 04:22:37,540
I look in the mirror.
I'm like,

6118
04:22:37,570 --> 04:22:39,720
oh,
you're also dressed up.

6119
04:22:41,050 --> 04:22:43,690
I had that same thing.
When I see myself in the preview,

6120
04:22:43,691 --> 04:22:44,780
I'm like,
oh my God.

6121
04:22:45,100 --> 04:22:47,660
See this,
this $1,000

6122
04:22:48,250 --> 04:22:50,440
some people making some funny jokes 
about how I look.

6123
04:22:50,470 --> 04:22:51,430
Oh yeah.
What are they saying?

6124
04:22:51,460 --> 04:22:54,610
Oh dear.
They call me like a cracked at Jesus.

6125
04:22:55,000 --> 04:22:57,100
Mr Jokes.
He make joke on me.

6126
04:22:57,101 --> 04:22:58,210
Dot.
How about that?

6127
04:22:59,050 --> 04:22:59,883
If I donate $1,000,
what's the funniest thing we can do to 

6128
04:23:02,070 --> 04:23:03,260
joey?
Um,

6129
04:23:03,310 --> 04:23:05,480
can we paint your whole face black at 
the sharpie?

6130
04:23:07,330 --> 04:23:09,420
Is faces already covered?
I mean there's,

6131
04:23:10,270 --> 04:23:13,240
there's not any room or where can I show
the grip tape?

6132
04:23:13,241 --> 04:23:15,000
I'm going to,
I'm going to put on this skateboard.

6133
04:23:15,030 --> 04:23:16,480
So cool.
That drifting.

6134
04:23:16,520 --> 04:23:17,130
Whoa,
Whoa,

6135
04:23:17,130 --> 04:23:17,700

6136
04:23:17,700 --> 04:23:18,510

Whoa,

6137
04:23:18,510 --> 04:23:19,161
Whoa,
Whoa,

6138
04:23:19,161 --> 04:23:19,911
whoa,
Whoa,

6139
04:23:19,911 --> 04:23:22,570
whoa.
That's pretty tubular grip tape.

6140
04:23:23,800 --> 04:23:24,633
Oh my God.
That's going to go on this side of the 

6141
04:23:26,771 --> 04:23:27,790
board.
So,

6142
04:23:28,380 --> 04:23:28,991
oops,
sorry.

6143
04:23:28,991 --> 04:23:30,070
It's going to be Bam,
right?

6144
04:23:30,071 --> 04:23:32,200
You can see her fucking and you're going
to whoa.

6145
04:23:32,440 --> 04:23:35,170
Whoa.
It's going to be morty.

6146
04:23:35,580 --> 04:23:37,180
And then I'm gonna,
I'm gonna also,

6147
04:23:37,181 --> 04:23:41,860
I'm going to do this board with risers 
and some big fat 70 millimeter wheels,

6148
04:23:42,250 --> 04:23:45,910
and I'll build this today on building 
skateboards.

6149
04:23:47,080 --> 04:23:48,840
Now I'm Dan.
Okay,

6150
04:23:49,070 --> 04:23:50,770
well,
I'm going to run to the bathroom.

6151
04:23:51,490 --> 04:23:54,750
I'm doing 1200 for the first drawing,
right?

6152
04:23:56,910 --> 04:24:00,100
So I'm gonna run to the bathroom and 
then when we come back,

6153
04:24:00,190 --> 04:24:02,230
we're going to call a psychic.
Okay.

6154
04:24:02,380 --> 04:24:03,860
All right.
I love back in five minutes.

6155
04:24:04,360 --> 04:24:05,210
Um,
Ooh.

6156
04:24:05,211 --> 04:24:07,340
Shout out to not go away.
Where at 62,000

6157
04:24:07,341 --> 04:24:08,174
guys pull it together for Christ's sake,
but thank you to everybody that's 

6158
04:24:13,030 --> 04:24:15,870
donated a,
yeah,

6159
04:24:15,930 --> 04:24:19,820
it just rolls off the tongue,
doesn't it like three and a half hours.

6160
04:24:19,821 --> 04:24:20,654
It was pretty well at that.
Shout out to the grandma's virginity 

6161
04:24:21,711 --> 04:24:22,730
podcast.
Justin.

6162
04:24:22,940 --> 04:24:27,270
Ah,
you've got an old school dry Yang.

6163
04:24:28,620 --> 04:24:29,930
Oh eat.
Oh Ethan,

6164
04:24:29,931 --> 04:24:30,764
you asshole.
He should have left that dude up there 

6165
04:24:32,541 --> 04:24:34,530
as the top donor.
I'm telling you he's,

6166
04:24:34,560 --> 04:24:37,160
he stole it man.
Well that means that means one of us.

6167
04:24:37,330 --> 04:24:37,911
Oh No,
no,

6168
04:24:37,911 --> 04:24:38,210
no,
no.

6169
04:24:38,210 --> 04:24:40,310
That means the fans have to outdo you 
ethan.

6170
04:24:40,340 --> 04:24:42,560
Like fucking knock him off.
And I was like someone looking for knock

6171
04:24:42,561 --> 04:24:45,140
him off his little pedestal not to 
donate.

6172
04:24:45,200 --> 04:24:47,150
All right,
I'm getting drawn on me.

6173
04:24:47,930 --> 04:24:49,070
Uh,
I don't know if,

6174
04:24:49,080 --> 04:24:51,350
uh,
I think that was Ethan's brainchild.

6175
04:24:51,380 --> 04:24:53,600
Ethan's got to decide what exists on 
your face.

6176
04:24:53,601 --> 04:24:54,560
It's up to him,
man.

6177
04:24:54,790 --> 04:24:55,970
Your face.
This is property,

6178
04:24:56,030 --> 04:24:57,170
unfortunately.
Yeah.

6179
04:24:58,010 --> 04:24:58,550
They,
uh,

6180
04:24:58,550 --> 04:24:59,570
uh,
people in the,

6181
04:24:59,571 --> 04:25:01,310
uh,
everyone donating.

6182
04:25:01,311 --> 04:25:03,410
Any suggestions for what I should do for
my next,

6183
04:25:03,411 --> 04:25:04,940
uh,
drawing dropping on me.

6184
04:25:04,941 --> 04:25:06,890
Let me know.
$1.

6185
04:25:06,891 --> 04:25:09,310
Just $1 to believe a comment.
It could be a,

6186
04:25:09,320 --> 04:25:10,880
it could be anything.
Got this tattoo.

6187
04:25:12,960 --> 04:25:13,920
Oh,
look at that little guy.

6188
04:25:14,160 --> 04:25:15,780
Peanut.
Should I be drawn one of those drawers?

6189
04:25:15,810 --> 04:25:18,090
Joe's showing me the Dick on his leg.
He's got a leg dick.

6190
04:25:19,650 --> 04:25:20,850
But um,
it was,

6191
04:25:20,860 --> 04:25:22,650
it has to be requested by the audience.
All right.

6192
04:25:22,651 --> 04:25:24,190
And you got to see what they're going to
ask for.

6193
04:25:25,510 --> 04:25:27,130
I just want a sweater.
I'm sorry.

6194
04:25:27,131 --> 04:25:28,990
Sad bear.
I can't give you a sweater,

6195
04:25:28,991 --> 04:25:32,830
but I was,
I was having a hard time donating.

6196
04:25:32,831 --> 04:25:35,880
I was just trying to donate right now.
It's just so hard.

6197
04:25:36,700 --> 04:25:37,533
I should like,
I shouldn't be like pointing my phone 

6198
04:25:38,711 --> 04:25:41,560
towards the camera.
Entering my credit card number.

6199
04:25:42,450 --> 04:25:45,190
[inaudible] Santa Joey,
we got,

6200
04:25:45,220 --> 04:25:46,760
we got was popping.
You know,

6201
04:25:49,050 --> 04:25:50,220
we've got the dyngus

6202
04:25:50,840 --> 04:25:51,490
love you guys.
Hey,

6203
04:25:51,490 --> 04:25:52,640
every single person.
Look,

6204
04:25:52,641 --> 04:25:54,260
I know there's been a little bit of 
negativity,

6205
04:25:54,261 --> 04:25:56,570
a little bit of like,
why don't you guys fucking donate more?

6206
04:25:56,571 --> 04:25:57,404
But Hey,
like literally every single person who 

6207
04:25:58,611 --> 04:25:59,444
donated a dollar is like bureau.
Like every single dollar is going 

6208
04:26:02,511 --> 04:26:06,770
straight to a good cause.
All of you guys would feel amazing hours

6209
04:26:06,770 --> 04:26:09,980
ago.
I'm almost 64 grand.

6210
04:26:09,981 --> 04:26:11,990
That's a lot of the money.
That's like a nice car.

6211
04:26:12,050 --> 04:26:14,180
Somebody keeps saying draw.
Ethan has post Malone,

6212
04:26:14,181 --> 04:26:15,014
but it's like all we have to do is keep 
drawing on his face and he's like 

6213
04:26:16,980 --> 04:26:19,030
[inaudible] he's getting there.
He's getting closer.

6214
04:26:19,460 --> 04:26:21,500
Just write like always tired.
Right?

6215
04:26:21,501 --> 04:26:23,240
Isn't that it on the,
on the eyelids.

6216
04:26:23,510 --> 04:26:24,740
Keep it up.
Proud of you.

6217
04:26:24,860 --> 04:26:27,080
Thank you.
Michelle Obama always tired too.

6218
04:26:27,081 --> 04:26:28,310
Fuck.
That's relatable,

6219
04:26:28,311 --> 04:26:31,490
right?
Lots of thick boys in this dream.

6220
04:26:31,520 --> 04:26:34,280
Wowza.
I don't know if that was,

6221
04:26:34,370 --> 04:26:35,700
I don't know if I can take that.
Yeah,

6222
04:26:35,720 --> 04:26:36,553
that's probably me.
I feel like I want to take the 

6223
04:26:39,531 --> 04:26:40,364
compliment,
but I don't think I'm thinking of for 

6224
04:26:41,241 --> 04:26:42,074
that.
Do you guys want to see me light myself 

6225
04:26:44,391 --> 04:26:48,470
on fire for the next okay,
here.

6226
04:26:48,500 --> 04:26:49,820
$1 donations.
Yes.

6227
04:26:49,821 --> 04:26:50,654
$2 for no.
I know I kind of took the prime real 

6228
04:26:52,401 --> 04:26:53,720
estate but you will,
you will.

6229
04:26:53,721 --> 04:26:54,860
You just,
right.

6230
04:26:54,980 --> 04:26:57,650
You want me to be some there Paul Paul 
Rodriguez,

6231
04:26:57,651 --> 04:26:59,220
the skateboarder wrote it.
This is like,

6232
04:26:59,320 --> 04:27:02,100
this is like and then and then and then 
when you just,

6233
04:27:02,100 --> 04:27:03,810
just,
just like somewhere in like the cold war

6234
04:27:03,820 --> 04:27:05,400
in like Zig Zag.
The foil.

6235
04:27:05,401 --> 04:27:06,450
Yeah,
the core foil.

6236
04:27:07,410 --> 04:27:09,980
I want to get Ethan to sign it.
Like everyone should sign it once,

6237
04:27:09,981 --> 04:27:11,550
once and then I,
then I'm going to fucking,

6238
04:27:11,790 --> 04:27:13,350
I'm going to like,
I'm going to literally build that.

6239
04:27:13,351 --> 04:27:16,890
That will be a full complete deck.
If I sign it you'll get devalued.

6240
04:27:16,891 --> 04:27:18,570
So yeah,
Joe,

6241
04:27:18,571 --> 04:27:21,630
you're not allowed to sign it.
Draw some cool shit.

6242
04:27:21,660 --> 04:27:24,540
This is a pretty great prize.
I think it is cause it's amazing.

6243
04:27:24,820 --> 04:27:27,540
We're all going to draw on this deck and
then I'm going to actually,

6244
04:27:27,630 --> 04:27:28,980
I'm going to,
I'm going to set this deck up.

6245
04:27:29,010 --> 04:27:31,350
The Wa like as like a deck that I would 
ride.

6246
04:27:31,351 --> 04:27:34,190
Like this was sort of my,
you know,

6247
04:27:34,290 --> 04:27:35,370
preference.
Justin,

6248
04:27:35,371 --> 04:27:37,680
would you describe yourself risers?
Oh by the way,

6249
04:27:37,770 --> 04:27:39,700
keep in mind you're drawing,
right?

6250
04:27:39,701 --> 04:27:43,830
Well pads are going to be speaking out 
the corner so like yeah,

6251
04:27:43,831 --> 04:27:46,190
he's peeking out of the corner so,
but I'll put the signature over there.

6252
04:27:46,270 --> 04:27:47,103
Yeah,
like keep drawing but go and draw mabel 

6253
04:27:49,720 --> 04:27:50,850
like like right,
right here.

6254
04:27:51,450 --> 04:27:52,710
Probably just going to frame it as it 
is.

6255
04:27:52,711 --> 04:27:53,544
I don't think they gonna ride.
No,

6256
04:27:53,550 --> 04:27:55,470
but it's going to come to them complete 
with,

6257
04:27:55,500 --> 04:27:56,790
oh,
I'm going to build it.

6258
04:27:56,791 --> 04:27:57,624
I'm going to,
I'm going to build it all at school 

6259
04:27:58,951 --> 04:27:59,784
full.
But they could take the trucks off and 

6260
04:28:00,991 --> 04:28:05,991
then frame it if that's what they want 
with the trucks were actually true.

6261
04:28:07,020 --> 04:28:08,280
We could,
here we go.

6262
04:28:08,460 --> 04:28:12,990
I'm putting some big fat fucking a 70 
millimeter wheels on it and then eat and

6263
04:28:12,991 --> 04:28:16,080
this and this.
Amazing as the thing.

6264
04:28:16,081 --> 04:28:17,040
Which side do you frame?

6265
04:28:19,220 --> 04:28:21,360
What company is is?
Oh enjoy.

6266
04:28:22,290 --> 04:28:24,420
This is some good grip tape.
This is fucking great.

6267
04:28:24,570 --> 04:28:26,910
Better than just plain old.
Like flat,

6268
04:28:27,300 --> 04:28:29,040
flat black.
Yeah.

6269
04:28:29,041 --> 04:28:31,920
The Joan donations of slowed down.
I feel like we got to think of like a,

6270
04:28:32,220 --> 04:28:35,040
Hey,
donate in the goddamn money.

6271
04:28:35,070 --> 04:28:35,903
Think of like a sub one for a 65 until 
we fucking just just burn the midnight 

6272
04:28:40,741 --> 04:28:42,780
oil.
Just get some coffee man.

6273
04:28:45,760 --> 04:28:49,170
It's Tuesday.
Well what could we do to get more people

6274
04:28:51,360 --> 04:28:52,193
to your friends?
Tweet it to your very famous friends to 

6275
04:28:53,791 --> 04:28:54,624
have like millions of followers just to 
save way more famous friends and you do 

6276
04:28:58,021 --> 04:28:59,910
but he's not going to bug them.
So you got a bug.

6277
04:28:59,911 --> 04:29:02,500
Your own famous friends grabbed some 
famous friends for sure.

6278
04:29:02,510 --> 04:29:06,630
I have been sort of pinging be nudging,
pinging and nudging and then they like,

6279
04:29:06,910 --> 04:29:07,743
it's a gentle and then they like pop 
into the feed and just see it's like 

6280
04:29:10,710 --> 04:29:13,260
eating pizza and like dropping a pencil 
on the ground.

6281
04:29:14,640 --> 04:29:15,480
Let's go.
Let's do it.

6282
04:29:19,880 --> 04:29:24,750
This is commitment man.
Sorry Ethan.

6283
04:29:24,751 --> 04:29:29,751
Will you do the graver phone call now?
Will you just sign right over here?

6284
04:29:30,900 --> 04:29:31,733
Keep in mind there's going to be,
there's going to be a riser pad right 

6285
04:29:33,871 --> 04:29:35,490
here.
Right here.

6286
04:29:35,510 --> 04:29:36,343
So like right in this neighborhood and I
want Elo to sign somewhere like along 

6287
04:29:39,960 --> 04:29:44,960
along the side here for credit card.
Put it in.

6288
04:29:45,570 --> 04:29:46,403
This is a tax write off because we were 
doing a benefit for a church or a 

6289
04:29:50,640 --> 04:29:54,480
church.
Whatever weird stuff you see we're doing

6290
04:29:54,481 --> 04:29:57,070
a charity event.
What have,

6291
04:29:57,710 --> 04:29:59,980
see by the way,
I'm

6292
04:29:59,980 --> 04:30:03,790
really sick today.
I'm taking you the,

6293
04:30:04,500 --> 04:30:07,150
let me list a total fucking trooper.
She woke up this morning like

6294
04:30:08,010 --> 04:30:10,590
sore throat,
not feeling good and by the way,

6295
04:30:11,610 --> 04:30:14,430
gargle some salt water and did it work?
Did it help a little bit?

6296
04:30:14,431 --> 04:30:15,264
Yeah.

6297
04:30:17,520 --> 04:30:19,450
Helps that.
You hear that ladies and gentlemen,

6298
04:30:19,451 --> 04:30:21,640
Garbo that salt.
We'll have my signature.

6299
04:30:21,850 --> 04:30:25,330
That's how I sign everything.
You asshole.

6300
04:30:25,420 --> 04:30:26,770
I actually like it.
That's great.

6301
04:30:27,490 --> 04:30:30,700
Okay,
so you look right here.

6302
04:30:31,060 --> 04:30:32,950
Okay.
Just anything you want.

6303
04:30:33,010 --> 04:30:34,870
Maybe even draw something cool.
Okay.

6304
04:30:35,050 --> 04:30:38,800
You can do it.
Portrait or landscape,

6305
04:30:39,300 --> 04:30:40,133
whatever you want it.
It's crazy that the president called in 

6306
04:30:41,741 --> 04:30:42,180
earlier.

6307
04:30:42,180 --> 04:30:43,050
Yeah.
Oh my God.

6308
04:30:43,051 --> 04:30:44,530
I'm still like tripping out.
You know,

6309
04:30:44,610 --> 04:30:46,770
none of us expected.
I'm glad we hit,

6310
04:30:46,820 --> 04:30:48,600
you know,
I'd love to have him call back in,

6311
04:30:48,780 --> 04:30:50,220
but after I kind of think about

6312
04:30:50,430 --> 04:30:53,310
a few more things I'd like to ask,
right?

6313
04:30:53,550 --> 04:30:54,241
Yeah.
We kind of,

6314
04:30:54,241 --> 04:30:57,450
we missed some opportunities.
Crayola crayon color names.

6315
04:30:59,130 --> 04:31:00,750
That'd be a good one,
right?

6316
04:31:01,310 --> 04:31:02,930
Yeah.
I want to know what he thinks about like

6317
04:31:02,931 --> 04:31:03,764
polly pocket and mighty Max.
That whole war from the eighties you 

6318
04:31:05,541 --> 04:31:06,374
know,
which one's better?

6319
04:31:06,560 --> 04:31:07,850
What's his opinion on these,
uh,

6320
04:31:07,851 --> 04:31:09,350
on these new rereleases of,
yeah,

6321
04:31:09,410 --> 04:31:11,180
the Shama Gotchas.
It's like,

6322
04:31:12,470 --> 04:31:14,000
you know,
why don't,

6323
04:31:14,001 --> 04:31:16,180
why do Japanese people get all the cool 
Tamma got cheese?

6324
04:31:16,190 --> 04:31:17,023
You know,
I really do want to ask such a good 

6325
04:31:18,711 --> 04:31:19,544
question.
Does he think that Amiibos gives an 

6326
04:31:22,661 --> 04:31:24,190
unfair balanced,
I mean,

6327
04:31:24,540 --> 04:31:28,790
what's he going to do to prevent the 
rise of ai in the form of Amoebas?

6328
04:31:29,870 --> 04:31:31,840
Amoebas is not fair.
Like Amoeba is.

6329
04:31:31,850 --> 04:31:36,700
Ain't ain't fair there too expansive.
All right.

6330
04:31:37,380 --> 04:31:40,490
Where are we literally gave some psychic
hotline.

6331
04:31:40,580 --> 04:31:45,580
Oh my God.
It says top donor $2,000

6332
04:31:45,711 --> 04:31:47,450
shredder.
Give me one more minute.

6333
04:31:47,780 --> 04:31:49,430
I'm getting us set up an account with 
them.

6334
04:31:49,520 --> 04:31:52,270
I don't see that to me.
Why do I see that?

6335
04:31:52,600 --> 04:31:53,930
You got to refresh.
Maybe.

6336
04:31:54,500 --> 04:31:58,530
Maybe it's in your need to refresh and 
there it is.

6337
04:31:58,700 --> 04:32:00,590
There we go.
Nope.

6338
04:32:00,800 --> 04:32:01,633
Draw Jesus eating.

6339
04:32:02,580 --> 04:32:03,830
Oh wait,
wait,

6340
04:32:03,840 --> 04:32:04,673
wait.
Who is that red or is someone that 

6341
04:32:07,300 --> 04:32:10,510
someone here,
Lex Machina.

6342
04:32:12,740 --> 04:32:13,573
The higher that gets,
the more unlikely it's going to be that 

6343
04:32:16,080 --> 04:32:17,570
it'll,
it'll be from like a real fan.

6344
04:32:24,450 --> 04:32:29,450
Most of that 75 just see that joey 
salads eat that yummy little mugs.

6345
04:32:29,580 --> 04:32:30,510
Gummy.

6346
04:32:30,590 --> 04:32:31,423
All right.
We're going to call it an where we got 

6347
04:32:32,571 --> 04:32:35,960
to get to that 75 you guys eat do it for
Ila for Christ's sake.

6348
04:32:35,961 --> 04:32:37,130
She's sick.
She,

6349
04:32:37,131 --> 04:32:38,210
she's pregnant.
Yeah,

6350
04:32:38,211 --> 04:32:42,210
she her.
He wants to sleep but she has had 25 no,

6351
04:32:44,660 --> 04:32:46,420
I'll stay,
but you list style.

6352
04:32:46,790 --> 04:32:50,000
It's already been five hours.
The dying to get out of here.

6353
04:32:51,230 --> 04:32:54,830
The crows dying.
I don't know if that's going to happen.

6354
04:32:54,940 --> 04:32:56,450
Yeah.
I don't know if it's going to happen.

6355
04:32:56,451 --> 04:33:00,300
Maybe we tell they get the call if we 
get to 70 what is you been on with?

6356
04:33:00,301 --> 04:33:01,170
Shredder.
Oh,

6357
04:33:01,171 --> 04:33:02,004
that was you toes literally having such 
a hard time like getting all the pieces 

6358
04:33:05,031 --> 04:33:08,660
to work that I just dropped it.
I just drop it in the hard.

6359
04:33:09,080 --> 04:33:10,880
You were having a hard time bidding on 
something.

6360
04:33:10,900 --> 04:33:12,110
Are you decided?
I just kept,

6361
04:33:12,111 --> 04:33:14,830
every time I kept selecting it kept like
popping off.

6362
04:33:14,870 --> 04:33:17,090
So tell [inaudible] was fucking you.
I mean,

6363
04:33:17,091 --> 04:33:18,890
I'm also an idiot,
so it might've been my,

6364
04:33:18,930 --> 04:33:23,930
you're not that dog ready?
You getting into anything?

6365
04:33:24,111 --> 04:33:26,180
Where are you being a cutie pie?
All right Dan,

6366
04:33:26,181 --> 04:33:30,050
how are we doing on the psychic draw?
A T rex surfing on a chainsaw.

6367
04:33:31,350 --> 04:33:35,320
Happies them 70,000
we call the psychic.

6368
04:33:35,360 --> 04:33:36,980
Yeah.
If we get to 70,000

6369
04:33:37,250 --> 04:33:38,083
just in really wants to prank calling a 
psychic and maybe maybe it'll turn out 

6370
04:33:41,121 --> 04:33:41,954
the psychic has like our future and like
maybe we'll actually learn something 

6371
04:33:44,331 --> 04:33:45,164
like this in reuland.
We're Joe not humanity hangs in the 

6372
04:33:50,181 --> 04:33:51,290
balance.
Oh,

6373
04:33:51,320 --> 04:33:53,720
Zach says he's on the phone right now.
I get it.

6374
04:33:53,721 --> 04:33:54,640
Less plus.
Okay.

6375
04:33:56,090 --> 04:33:57,980
Wow.
This is really fascinating stuff.

6376
04:33:58,550 --> 04:34:00,020
I didn't know you were into 
skateboarding.

6377
04:34:00,021 --> 04:34:01,540
Justin.
What?

6378
04:34:02,450 --> 04:34:03,760
I didn't know you were into 
skateboarding.

6379
04:34:03,970 --> 04:34:08,970
I just realize I need a fucking like a 
box cutter style blade.

6380
04:34:09,770 --> 04:34:10,910
Do you skateboard,
Justin?

6381
04:34:12,100 --> 04:34:15,810
Really?
I'm not fucking out there and do.

6382
04:34:15,940 --> 04:34:17,260
Well you can create,
you can like,

6383
04:34:18,380 --> 04:34:23,210
you can roll your role.
When you were younger did you skateboard

6384
04:34:23,211 --> 04:34:26,290
like as its mode of transportation?
No kidding.

6385
04:34:30,320 --> 04:34:32,320
That's really pleasant.
I'm sure all the podcasts,

6386
04:34:32,340 --> 04:34:35,570
this nerves,
y'all put my mind towards that.

6387
04:34:35,690 --> 04:34:37,880
The only thing tops that is me chewing 
into the mic.

6388
04:34:40,580 --> 04:34:41,900
Well,
I'm excited about this.

6389
04:34:41,901 --> 04:34:44,900
Uh,
uh,

6390
04:34:45,350 --> 04:34:50,350
people are saying isla go home girl.
Well we wish it was possible.

6391
04:34:51,440 --> 04:34:54,230
We're getting close to 67,000
yet cock suckers.

6392
04:34:54,620 --> 04:34:58,400
Anyone have a fucking,
I forgot to bring my little razor blade.

6393
04:34:58,401 --> 04:34:59,234
Like there's probably not a box cutter.
I can just take the blade out and just 

6394
04:35:05,830 --> 04:35:08,300
going to shit.
I already got the grip tape on,

6395
04:35:08,330 --> 04:35:10,340
but how does it stay on there?
Did you glue it or something?

6396
04:35:10,341 --> 04:35:14,250
It doesn't load sticker.
Oh sticker.

6397
04:35:14,670 --> 04:35:16,970
And so you can see,
wow,

6398
04:35:16,971 --> 04:35:18,270
that's a CIC board.
Yeah,

6399
04:35:18,271 --> 04:35:19,104
that looks pretty awesome.
This grip tape and then the signature 

6400
04:35:22,430 --> 04:35:25,520
and once I get the trucks and yeah,
I think,

6401
04:35:25,521 --> 04:35:26,930
I think this will be this,
this one's good.

6402
04:35:26,931 --> 04:35:29,300
That's a nice option.
And I think that's a nice build.

6403
04:35:29,301 --> 04:35:33,560
Would you say it's a pretty nice,
I'll call that a build,

6404
04:35:34,330 --> 04:35:35,420
right?
While we wait for that,

6405
04:35:35,421 --> 04:35:40,421
for that little razor blade.
Let's see what other fucking stuck in my

6406
04:35:40,790 --> 04:35:42,590
Dan and Sarah,
whoever's out there.

6407
04:35:42,650 --> 04:35:44,840
If you have a razor blade,
help help a brother out.

6408
04:35:45,260 --> 04:35:48,260
I haven't got a video.
I'm not sure I wanted to show it because

6409
04:35:48,261 --> 04:35:51,050
I love it so much that I wanted to save 
it for a main channel,

6410
04:35:53,840 --> 04:35:54,860
but nobody's doing paying.

6411
04:35:56,040 --> 04:35:56,873
I'm paying attention,
but I'm not going to play it unless we 

6412
04:35:58,201 --> 04:36:02,940
get 70,000.
We need to some hip hop Ila Ethan drop a

6413
04:36:02,941 --> 04:36:04,990
beat freestyle.
Oh yeah,

6414
04:36:06,330 --> 04:36:08,940
that's a,
that's a blast from the past.

6415
04:36:09,510 --> 04:36:10,470
Um,
Oh,

6416
04:36:10,620 --> 04:36:13,290
you know what?
I want it to reminisce a little bit.

6417
04:36:13,291 --> 04:36:14,124
I was,
I was thinking how did we raised last 

6418
04:36:16,920 --> 04:36:17,850
year,
so much money.

6419
04:36:17,910 --> 04:36:21,030
And then I watched this clip back and I 
was just,

6420
04:36:21,450 --> 04:36:24,840
I thought it was so wonderful.
So I want you to reminisce,

6421
04:36:24,900 --> 04:36:28,050
reminisce a little bit here.
I love so much.

6422
04:36:28,260 --> 04:36:29,093
Oh,
it's so well [inaudible] it's just 

6423
04:36:41,820 --> 04:36:42,653
legendary I guess.
Like you really can't talk this right 

6424
04:36:46,520 --> 04:36:51,520
since is Christmas morning.
So happy about it.

6425
04:36:52,870 --> 04:36:55,600
Just so fun.
Just amazing.

6426
04:36:59,350 --> 04:37:03,760
I'm like telling him there's so much 
horrible for him.

6427
04:37:03,761 --> 04:37:04,594
I was like,
come on.

6428
04:37:08,300 --> 04:37:13,010
All right.
Who Do we have to dig up that,

6429
04:37:13,050 --> 04:37:15,880
that Pepsi versus bringing it back?
I mean,

6430
04:37:15,881 --> 04:37:20,260
it's dark.
When do we do it?

6431
04:37:20,261 --> 04:37:21,200
Last year,
what?

6432
04:37:21,270 --> 04:37:23,080
It was about September,
I think.

6433
04:37:23,140 --> 04:37:25,370
Oh,
so it was before the time changed.

6434
04:37:25,500 --> 04:37:26,970
Just yeah.
Or wait,

6435
04:37:27,100 --> 04:37:27,933
what was it was before?
Probably was 50 bucks from anonymous 

6436
04:37:31,600 --> 04:37:33,020
ruins my life.
I hate it.

6437
04:37:34,340 --> 04:37:36,280
I was,
oh man.

6438
04:37:37,270 --> 04:37:38,230
Well,
we're only eight guys.

6439
04:37:38,231 --> 04:37:40,570
We are here.
We are ratcheting.

6440
04:37:40,571 --> 04:37:43,610
We're getting up there.
We're getting up there guys.

6441
04:37:43,660 --> 04:37:44,740
Hello.
Hello.

6442
04:37:44,741 --> 04:37:48,490
We see you guys eat me.
Eat me up inside boys.

6443
04:37:49,830 --> 04:37:52,320
The um,
the psychic Dennis queuing that up.

6444
04:37:52,380 --> 04:37:53,550
Uh,
Zachary Ian.

6445
04:37:54,690 --> 04:37:57,720
Almost there you say scrambling.
Trying to set up is insane.

6446
04:37:58,180 --> 04:38:01,230
I love how they are like charging you by
the minute and they're like,

6447
04:38:02,010 --> 04:38:04,650
they're probably start right dude,
I just need a,

6448
04:38:04,740 --> 04:38:06,330
Oh,
we're getting some big donations.

6449
04:38:06,331 --> 04:38:07,350
Yeah,
I think it helps having,

6450
04:38:07,380 --> 04:38:08,970
having the donation wall up people.
Yeah.

6451
04:38:09,030 --> 04:38:11,040
You can see the name up there.
We read some of this.

6452
04:38:11,120 --> 04:38:11,980
Oh yeah,

Thank you guys.

6454
04:38:14,290 --> 04:38:16,090
M nickel,
Katie.

6455
04:38:17,160 --> 04:38:18,810
She's almost ready for the next.
Excellent.

6456

That's perfect guys.
75 k's a great,

6457
04:38:23,100 --> 04:38:24,450
that's,
that's nothing to be ashamed.

6458
04:38:24,710 --> 04:38:25,810
Yeah.
That's nothing to sneeze at.

6459
04:38:26,070 --> 04:38:27,840
That's just a lie.
Pepper.

6460
04:38:27,850 --> 04:38:28,700
Right.
Ready?

6461
04:38:28,701 --> 04:38:31,300
Let's get her in and play the next song.

6462
04:38:31,301 --> 04:38:32,780
What while we,
while we wait for,

6463
04:38:32,810 --> 04:38:35,390
shall I pull up some media?
No.

6464
04:38:36,020 --> 04:38:37,850
Well I mean,
I don't know.

6465
04:38:37,910 --> 04:38:38,743
I was going to say,
let's get onto you to go until so 

6466
04:38:40,740 --> 04:38:43,310
awesome.
Should I save this video?

6467
04:38:43,670 --> 04:38:47,450
I mean people got this good shit.
We're going to get to the video.

6468
04:38:47,600 --> 04:38:50,930
People got to pay.
They want to watch this.

6469
04:38:50,931 --> 04:38:53,270
People got up there and do a God damn 
monster.

6470
04:38:53,290 --> 04:38:54,160
I'm just saying,

6471
04:38:54,160 --> 04:38:56,780

6475
04:39:02,441 --> 04:39:04,700

6476
04:39:05,620 --> 04:39:06,920
I'm sure we've got some of,
I think,

6477
04:39:07,860 --> 04:39:09,550
is there anything in this chick?
Tell me,

6478
04:39:09,551 --> 04:39:11,800
how are you feeling right now?
As a matter of fact,

6479
04:39:11,970 --> 04:39:13,720
I don't know.
I wonder if I should go.

6480
04:39:14,490 --> 04:39:15,940
Do you want to lay down in the other 
room?

6481
04:39:16,390 --> 04:39:19,510
Maybe bloody low.
Lay down dealers earned,

6482
04:39:19,590 --> 04:39:22,000
uh,
that check.

6483
04:39:22,030 --> 04:39:22,863
Okay.
Look sick.

6484
04:39:23,220 --> 04:39:25,540
Actually I don't know why but

6485
04:39:25,750 --> 04:39:27,790
back really hard because you're 
pregnant.

6486
04:39:28,060 --> 04:39:33,060
I guess you've got like all this weight.
You never even get that jacket.

6487
04:39:33,551 --> 04:39:37,540
Looks fricking amazing.
Is that one coming out in January?

6488
04:39:37,660 --> 04:39:38,493
Oh my God.
I love the zipper and the yellow like a 

6489
04:39:40,510 --> 04:39:41,620
cough.
I want it.

6490
04:39:43,420 --> 04:39:44,640
You got it?
Fine.

6491
04:39:45,580 --> 04:39:46,413
So why don't you go lay down in the 
other room and I think we're gonna be 

6492
04:39:48,521 --> 04:39:51,370
hitting 75 here pretty soon.
All right,

6493
04:39:55,870 --> 04:39:56,703
hold on guys.

6494
04:39:56,730 --> 04:39:57,870
You guys,

6495
04:39:57,871 --> 04:39:58,704

6496
04:39:59,030 --> 04:39:59,851
All right.
All right.

6497
04:39:59,851 --> 04:40:01,510
We'll keep it.
We'll keep it home and take care of.

6498
04:40:01,630 --> 04:40:05,570
All right,
let's do two new vibe.

6499
04:40:06,570 --> 04:40:09,170
This is the 70 5:00
AM we have all the sound stuff.

6500
04:40:09,620 --> 04:40:10,960
Every sound that you get.
Roll them.

6501
04:40:11,010 --> 04:40:16,010
Roll.
We've got whatever today about Munchkins

6502
04:40:16,521 --> 04:40:18,060
and I'm not talking about what you 
think.

6503
04:40:18,080 --> 04:40:22,940
We're pressing all the buttons,
non offensive month type of Munchkin.

6504
04:40:25,320 --> 04:40:26,850
I do like this groaning crowd.

6505
04:40:27,150 --> 04:40:30,480
Whoa.
Oh,

6506
04:40:31,550 --> 04:40:32,860
oh,
hello.

6507
04:40:32,861 --> 04:40:37,310
Whoever's still watching this chaos.
Listen,

6508
04:40:37,311 --> 04:40:38,144
I'm just trying to build me a god Dang 
skateboard deck and I'm just trying to 

6509
04:40:41,061 --> 04:40:42,980
have a good time.
All right.

6510
04:40:42,981 --> 04:40:44,540
Can we get some,
let's see.

6511
04:40:45,060 --> 04:40:45,390
Yeah,

6512
04:40:45,390 --> 04:40:46,770
let's,
can we get some,

6513
04:40:46,771 --> 04:40:47,720
let's see.
Oh,

6514
04:40:47,730 --> 04:40:51,220

Get Stan let Georgia state at the time.

6515
04:40:52,800 --> 04:40:54,480
Got me all right.
Sorry.

6516
04:40:54,530 --> 04:40:57,550
Sorry.
Sorry Lou Lou Lou hanging free.

6517
04:40:58,560 --> 04:40:59,930
All right.
I think I'm going to do that.

6518
04:40:59,931 --> 04:41:00,764
I think I'm good.
I am going to draw Ethan as George 

6519
04:41:02,220 --> 04:41:02,800
Constanza.
I liked that.

6520
04:41:02,800 --> 04:41:03,421
Oh yeah.
That's a good,

6521
04:41:03,421 --> 04:41:05,220
that's a good,
when can we get a downward,

6522
04:41:05,300 --> 04:41:07,470
uh,
as he draws camera angle.

6523
04:41:08,120 --> 04:41:10,080
I don't think that camera exist.
That would be fun.

6524
04:41:10,680 --> 04:41:12,700
It's like an unboxing style camera.

6525
04:41:14,060 --> 04:41:14,210
Okay.

6526
04:41:14,210 --> 04:41:16,700
Tell him aussie hero nation.
The hockey song.

6527
04:41:16,790 --> 04:41:17,451
Yes.
Yeah,

6528
04:41:17,451 --> 04:41:19,830
we got the donations up.
Raiden renards they're,

6529
04:41:19,850 --> 04:41:21,080
they're right up there.
Let me clear,

6530
04:41:21,081 --> 04:41:23,060
you're clear this out of the way.
Oh,

6531
04:41:23,061 --> 04:41:23,990
thank you.
Hand that over to me.

6532
04:41:24,020 --> 04:41:25,100
Yes.
You're going to need that.

6533
04:41:25,130 --> 04:41:27,050
I've been requested.
Ethan's actually really hard.

6534
04:41:27,390 --> 04:41:28,730
Now this,
this deck is like,

6535
04:41:28,790 --> 04:41:30,890
all I need to do is cut the grip tape 
off and then I can

6536
04:41:30,980 --> 04:41:32,810
move onto the next step.
Alex,

6537
04:41:32,811 --> 04:41:35,240
have you left the room since our

6538
04:41:36,490 --> 04:41:37,323
oh yeah.
Once.

6539
04:41:37,500 --> 04:41:38,333
We never lead the rule.
We've always been here and we will 

6540
04:41:41,081 --> 04:41:41,570
always

6541
04:41:41,570 --> 04:41:43,820
be here.
No Shit.

6542
04:41:45,440 --> 04:41:47,030
Oh fuck.
Sorry.

6543
04:41:48,530 --> 04:41:52,190
I knew I forgot the fucking box.
Like the razor

6544
04:41:52,190 --> 04:41:53,630
blade.
I knew,

6545
04:41:53,631 --> 04:41:55,490
I forgot that.
I didn't know,

6546
04:41:55,491 --> 04:41:57,290
but I was like,
I know I'm going to forget something for

6547
04:41:57,291 --> 04:41:58,370
the skateboard.
I know it.

6548
04:41:58,550 --> 04:41:59,720
I mean it shouldn't.
How hard,

6549
04:41:59,780 --> 04:42:01,370
how long does it take to finish 
something up like that?

6550
04:42:01,371 --> 04:42:02,210
You just have to cut it.
Right.

6551
04:42:02,230 --> 04:42:03,063
I got to do is turn it around and like 
it's so easy to just cut that off line 

6552
04:42:05,090 --> 04:42:06,800
and ran it down and then you're good.
And then,

6553
04:42:06,830 --> 04:42:08,930
then I can,
then I can do the rep really good one.

6554
04:42:09,290 --> 04:42:11,090
It's going to be,
by the way,

6555
04:42:11,091 --> 04:42:14,000
I'm going to build three decks.
That's awesome.

6556
04:42:14,030 --> 04:42:15,710
So,
and each in all three.

6557
04:42:15,711 --> 04:42:18,440
We're going to draw all over them.
It's going to be awesome.

6558

You got me there.

04:47:50,921 --> 04:47:51,754
What's his birthday?

6712
04:47:54,300 --> 04:47:57,250
Yeah.
Hello?

6713
04:48:00,790 --> 04:48:01,720
I can hear you.
Yeah.

6714
04:48:01,721 --> 04:48:03,100
How are you?
Hello,

6715
04:48:03,101 --> 04:48:04,510
how are you?
Okay.

6716
04:48:05,520 --> 04:48:06,353
Okay,
let me,

6717
04:48:07,180 --> 04:48:09,250
I'm good.
I just had a couple of questions.

6718
04:48:09,940 --> 04:48:10,773
Question number one,
thinking of opening to chucky cheese 

6719
04:48:14,380 --> 04:48:19,380
franchise and I am just,
it's causing me a bunch of grief.

6720
04:48:20,020 --> 04:48:20,853
By the way.
I just want to let you know that I'm 

6721
04:48:21,551 --> 04:48:24,490
recording this just for my own purse,
for my own playback.

6722
04:48:24,670 --> 04:48:27,790
I'm not even going to say personal,
but just from my own playback.

6723
04:48:28,660 --> 04:48:29,493
So this is important.
It's important because you know this 

6724
04:48:31,661 --> 04:48:32,494
isn't,
this isn't a pennies we're talking 

6725
04:48:34,391 --> 04:48:35,081
about.
This is,

6726
04:48:35,081 --> 04:48:35,914
you know,
this is,

6727
04:48:36,250 --> 04:48:39,640
this is the real mccoy.
So I can listen.

6728
04:48:39,690 --> 04:48:43,570
We can so we can all listen to this back
later and really get it all figured out.

6729
04:48:43,571 --> 04:48:46,610
So I'm trying to,
I'm thinking about open and um,

6730
04:48:46,770 --> 04:48:48,730
um,
e cheese.

6731
04:48:49,140 --> 04:48:49,973
Uh,
but really bringing it back to the old 

6732
04:48:51,311 --> 04:48:53,020
school,
like awesome.

6733
04:48:53,140 --> 04:48:55,600
Animatronic,
that style,

6734
04:48:55,690 --> 04:48:57,460
you know,
chuck e cheese,

6735
04:48:57,550 --> 04:48:58,990
you know,
variety hour,

6736
04:48:58,991 --> 04:49:02,940
like the rock fire explosion style,
you know,

6737
04:49:02,941 --> 04:49:05,550
the,
the kids get called in.

6738
04:49:05,551 --> 04:49:05,820
Yeah,

6739
04:49:05,820 --> 04:49:07,110
I know exactly what you're talking 
about.

6740
04:49:07,210 --> 04:49:11,140
So I'm thinking about doing that and I 
have a little bit of money.

6741
04:49:11,440 --> 04:49:12,273
I'm going to get some loans and some 
investments from friends and family and 

6742
04:49:16,690 --> 04:49:20,230
I'm doing this in Bakersfield.
So,

6743
04:49:20,231 --> 04:49:21,160
you know,
I'm thinking,

6744
04:49:21,161 --> 04:49:21,994
I'm thinking it'll work.
I'm thinking it's going to work and I 

6745
04:49:23,351 --> 04:49:26,140
just wanted to call and see what your 
opinions are.

6746
04:49:26,141 --> 04:49:28,900
Do you think that this will fly?
Do you think that this will really,

6747
04:49:29,290 --> 04:49:30,123
this,
is this going to put the wind in my 

6748
04:49:31,031 --> 04:49:32,410
financial sales?

6749
04:49:33,830 --> 04:49:35,870
Okay.
What I'm going to do is wrong with this.

6750
04:49:35,871 --> 04:49:39,900
I'm going to go straight to the cards.
I'm going to do a three card pull.

6751
04:49:39,901 --> 04:49:40,790
Let's see what we get.

6752
04:49:41,270 --> 04:49:44,860
Three Card Monte as they call it.
In my lap.

6753
04:49:45,620 --> 04:49:48,320
I gambled,
gambled all my money away last year.

6754
04:49:48,321 --> 04:49:49,850
So that's,
that's why I said that.

6755
04:49:52,300 --> 04:49:55,540
Okay.
Let's see what we get first cards and,

6756
04:49:55,840 --> 04:49:56,700
and by the way,
you might,

6757
04:49:56,710 --> 04:50:00,500
this could be an evaluation call,
this could be an evaluation call.

6758
04:50:00,501 --> 04:50:01,690
So just letting,
you know,

6759
04:50:04,000 --> 04:50:05,020
don't,
don't mess it up.

6760
04:50:05,640 --> 04:50:09,060
Are driving a brand salary like a 
negative nancy,

6761
04:50:09,650 --> 04:50:12,850
but we're talking money in here and,

6762
04:50:13,530 --> 04:50:15,240
but we're also talking dreams.

6763
04:50:15,880 --> 04:50:17,780
Whoa.
Um,

6764
04:50:18,470 --> 04:50:23,240
I've got the through with tenable's 
direct pedicles are known as the points

6765
04:50:23,990 --> 04:50:26,950
is fine.
So the Druid pinnacle direct,

6766
04:50:26,951 --> 04:50:27,784
is that what you said?

6767
04:50:29,190 --> 04:50:29,990
Okay.

6768
04:50:29,990 --> 04:50:31,460
I've tentacles direct.

6769
04:50:32,510 --> 04:50:37,000
I using the grandmom yet from the deck,
the Grumman Deck.

6770
04:50:37,270 --> 04:50:38,650
I'm just trying to like,
you're a bit,

6771
04:50:39,370 --> 04:50:40,420
it's a bit hard to hear,
but I'm,

6772
04:50:40,900 --> 04:50:42,130
I think I'm following you.

6773
04:50:42,640 --> 04:50:44,680
I know.
I think you've got me on speaker phone,

6774
04:50:44,681 --> 04:50:47,360
which is making a very fuzzy on my end 
also.

6775
04:50:50,400 --> 04:50:51,010
Hold on.
Okay.

6776
04:50:51,010 --> 04:50:51,843
Can you hear me?

6777
04:50:51,990 --> 04:50:52,823
Yeah,
yeah,

6778
04:50:52,860 --> 04:50:53,550
I can.
Okay.

6779
04:50:53,550 --> 04:50:54,383
Is that better?

6780
04:50:56,020 --> 04:50:57,130
Okay.
That's a little better.

6781
04:50:57,240 --> 04:50:58,073
Okay.

6782
04:51:00,810 --> 04:51:01,750
Okay.
Go ahead.

6783
04:51:04,810 --> 04:51:05,643
Panicles

6784
04:51:08,220 --> 04:51:10,110
right.
When you look directly at finances,

6785
04:51:10,111 --> 04:51:13,510
my concern is the level,
um,

6786
04:51:13,710 --> 04:51:14,790
it's reading low.

6787
04:51:15,830 --> 04:51:17,990
Oh,
you like my finances are reading low.

6788
04:51:19,780 --> 04:51:20,613
Okay.
We're reading directly on the thought 

6789
04:51:22,691 --> 04:51:27,691
process of starting this business,
doing the chuck e cheese investing.

6790
04:51:29,680 --> 04:51:30,513
Okay.

6791
04:51:31,390 --> 04:51:35,010
Chuck e cheese.
Are you saying I don't have enough coins

6792
04:51:35,011 --> 04:51:35,844
to do it?

6793
04:51:43,660 --> 04:51:44,493
Yeah.

6794
04:51:47,130 --> 04:51:47,970
Big,
big,

6795
04:51:48,660 --> 04:51:50,780
big money,
right?

6796
04:51:53,510 --> 04:51:56,080
Oh,
oh well that's quite an upset.

6797
04:51:56,950 --> 04:51:57,783
Yeah,

6798
04:51:58,690 --> 04:51:59,351
I mean,
you know,

6799
04:51:59,351 --> 04:52:00,800
you,
you know I,

6800
04:52:00,810 --> 04:52:04,810
I'm a big firm believer of of the chucky
cheese original model.

6801
04:52:04,811 --> 04:52:05,920
I'm like,
you know,

6802
04:52:05,921 --> 04:52:06,754
we might be living in a different time,
but I think where they went wrong was 

6803
04:52:09,911 --> 04:52:10,744
when they started taking out the cool 
animatronics and then they started 

6804
04:52:13,271 --> 04:52:15,910
taking out all the fun,
weird,

6805
04:52:15,911 --> 04:52:19,750
creepy rooms with the flashing strobe 
lights and all that kind of stuff.

6806
04:52:20,020 --> 04:52:22,720
As soon as they got rid of that stuff.
Yeah,

6807
04:52:22,750 --> 04:52:26,020
you're with me there.
Well at least we have some common ground

6808
04:52:26,021 --> 04:52:31,021
to build this.
Okay,

6809
04:52:33,641 --> 04:52:35,110
well see,
you know what I'm talking about.

6810
04:52:35,350 --> 04:52:40,350
So I'm ready to bring that back to 
Bakersfield with a punch to the city,

6811
04:52:40,931 --> 04:52:41,764
right in the throat of the city.
I'm going to bring this thing back and 

6812
04:52:43,991 --> 04:52:46,300
I'm going to,
and I think that,

6813
04:52:46,630 --> 04:52:50,260
so you're saying,
so the first card is the card of coins,

6814
04:52:50,890 --> 04:52:52,130
which could be good or bad,
right?

6815
04:52:54,730 --> 04:52:55,563
Tentacles

6816
04:52:55,770 --> 04:52:57,260
the three of pentacles

6817
04:52:58,630 --> 04:52:59,990
when you read directly.

6818
04:53:01,090 --> 04:53:01,990
Okay.
And so,

6819
04:53:01,991 --> 04:53:06,991
and three is that 3 million?
Is that 300 is it 3000 how many levels?

6820
04:53:11,830 --> 04:53:14,440
Like a hundred levels or 10 levels.

6821
04:53:14,680 --> 04:53:15,513
All right.

6822
04:53:17,000 --> 04:53:17,590
Oh,
okay.

6823
04:53:17,590 --> 04:53:18,423
So

6824
04:53:19,030 --> 04:53:19,930
I'm at a three

6825
04:53:20,190 --> 04:53:21,600
so you know,
I mean,

6826
04:53:21,870 --> 04:53:22,703
you know,
you look at it from a bitcoin 

6827
04:53:23,550 --> 04:53:24,540
perspective,
it's like,

6828
04:53:24,541 --> 04:53:25,374
well,
if I had,

6829
04:53:25,710 --> 04:53:30,710
if I had bought $300 a bitcoin in 2009 
or 2008 or if I bought $100 a bitcoin in

6830
04:53:33,841 --> 04:53:37,050
2008 so it was three versus 10 or sorry.
You know what I mean?

6831
04:53:38,160 --> 04:53:41,120
So it's not so bad.
Always a glass half full type.

6832
04:53:41,460 --> 04:53:44,610
I'm always a glass half full type.
Go ahead.

6833
04:53:44,910 --> 04:53:49,320
The next car is upon.
My other concern is the progress.

6834
04:53:51,000 --> 04:53:55,620
Well know my,
I hired my uncle and my cousin Dave,

6835
04:53:55,680 --> 04:53:57,060
they're out of work.
They need a job.

6836
04:53:57,061 --> 04:53:58,560
That's part of the reason why I'm doing 
this,

6837
04:53:58,620 --> 04:53:59,453
uh,
to dress up as the mascots and to help 

6838
04:54:01,411 --> 04:54:04,590
me oversee business and accounting and 
financing and all that stuff.

6839
04:54:04,591 --> 04:54:07,020
So I'm pretty confident on that front.
What,

6840
04:54:07,090 --> 04:54:07,923
what is,
what's the,

6841
04:54:08,040 --> 04:54:10,380
what's the next card you got

6842
04:54:12,560 --> 04:54:17,560
the middle car represent the movement.
I'm a mover and a shaker.

6843
04:54:20,770 --> 04:54:23,470
Well,
it's incorporated with the numerology of

6844
04:54:23,471 --> 04:54:27,040
the five.
It represents change.

6845
04:54:27,180 --> 04:54:30,750
You said something about a crawl space,
like number one.

6846
04:54:31,890 --> 04:54:32,723
Oh,
sorry.

6847
04:54:32,890 --> 04:54:33,970
No

6848
04:54:34,550 --> 04:54:35,383
number one is the side of the mover and 
a shaker and it's a crawl space kind of 

6849
04:54:39,651 --> 04:54:43,760
scenario where it's like you're going to
have to crawl to get to your dream.

6850
04:54:43,800 --> 04:54:45,740
I never said that.
And let me tell you something.

6851
04:54:45,741 --> 04:54:46,970
I have crawl,
I cry.

6852
04:54:46,990 --> 04:54:51,080
I crawled 12,000
feet.

6853
04:54:51,110 --> 04:54:56,060
I think it was our 12 12,000
feet out of a tunnel just to escape from

6854
04:54:56,061 --> 04:54:58,210
a situation.
I'm not going to get into it.

6855
04:54:59,330 --> 04:54:59,770
Good.
All right.

6856
04:54:59,770 --> 04:55:00,790
Can you hear me?
Yeah,

6857
04:55:00,791 --> 04:55:01,600
yeah.
I'm sorry.

6858
04:55:01,600 --> 04:55:05,200
I can hear you.
So you think about a crawl space.

6859
04:55:05,800 --> 04:55:06,850
Oh,
okay.

6860
04:55:06,851 --> 04:55:07,750
Sorry about.
Okay.

6861
04:55:07,751 --> 04:55:11,420
So I must have misheard that.
Okay.

6862
04:55:11,421 --> 04:55:12,050
So you said?
Yeah.

6863
04:55:12,050 --> 04:55:13,230
Wow.
I was explaining,

6864
04:55:14,190 --> 04:55:15,290
go ahead.
Oh,

6865
04:55:15,350 --> 04:55:18,650
I was at,
I was explaining the numerology.

6866
04:55:19,250 --> 04:55:24,250
Oh,
I'm looking at the flow of a business.

6867
04:55:25,830 --> 04:55:27,450
How is it going to flow?

6868
04:55:28,160 --> 04:55:29,390
I mean,
it flows,

6869
04:55:29,391 --> 04:55:31,370
you know what I mean?
It's just like with all the,

6870
04:55:31,550 --> 04:55:32,383
the,
just the relaxation and just 

6871
04:55:34,061 --> 04:55:34,894
[inaudible].
You go with the flow and you put all 

6872
04:55:36,951 --> 04:55:39,290
your heart and soul and effort and 
energy

6873
04:55:39,380 --> 04:55:41,570
and you're not,
you're not understanding.

6874
04:55:42,050 --> 04:55:43,820
Oh,
but what I'm trying to,

6875
04:55:44,270 --> 04:55:45,130
I'm looking at it.

6876
04:55:45,280 --> 04:55:47,590
Are you thinking of it like a 
psychedelic kind of a way?

6877
04:55:47,591 --> 04:55:48,424
Like,
um,

6878
04:55:48,940 --> 04:55:49,773
like,
uh,

6879
04:55:50,800 --> 04:55:51,633
okay.

6880
04:55:52,830 --> 04:55:55,410
No,
no.

6881
04:55:55,830 --> 04:55:57,310
Okay.
I'm okay.

6882
04:55:57,470 --> 04:56:00,220
I'm doing a business reading.

6883
04:56:00,380 --> 04:56:01,310
Okay.
Yes,

6884
04:56:01,311 --> 04:56:02,144
please.

6885
04:56:02,240 --> 04:56:04,530
Okay.
Hello.

6886
04:56:05,580 --> 04:56:10,580
Hello.
This is ever going to be consistent.

6887
04:56:11,090 --> 04:56:11,930
Okay.
There's,

6888
04:56:11,990 --> 04:56:13,060
there's always going to be okay

6889
04:56:13,620 --> 04:56:15,600
downs and I'm ready for that big up.

6890
04:56:16,280 --> 04:56:16,510
Okay.

6891
04:56:16,510 --> 04:56:18,850
When we opened the doors that were 
rolling in it,

6892
04:56:19,850 --> 04:56:23,240
buying our maseratis and all that stuff.

6893
04:56:24,140 --> 04:56:24,973
Okay.
Okay.

6894
04:56:26,260 --> 04:56:27,093
This is where I've got to do this.
I'm not going to give you false hope on 

6895
04:56:30,491 --> 04:56:31,324
this.
My advice to you would be they spend at 

6896
04:56:33,791 --> 04:56:38,791
least the next six months doing some 
major research possibly.

6897
04:56:40,290 --> 04:56:41,500
Oh Man.
Are you kidding me?

6898
04:56:43,350 --> 04:56:43,980
Demographic.

6899
04:56:43,980 --> 04:56:45,990
I'm going to cut you off right there 
because I,

6900
04:56:46,020 --> 04:56:46,853
the last year,
last 12 months I've been doing major 

6901
04:56:49,111 --> 04:56:49,944
research.
I watched a bunch of rocket fire 

6902
04:56:52,201 --> 04:56:56,910
explosion videos on youtube.
I went to a bunch of chuck e cheeses.

6903
04:56:56,911 --> 04:57:00,480
I talked to the employees,
talk to some of the children there.

6904
04:57:00,481 --> 04:57:02,430
I watch.
I watch that one video.

6905
04:57:02,431 --> 04:57:04,140
Have you seen that video of the little 
kid?

6906
04:57:04,830 --> 04:57:06,200
I can't help you.

6907
04:57:08,720 --> 04:57:09,620
No,
you're helping me.

6908
04:57:09,621 --> 04:57:11,180
This is incredible.
You are giving me,

6909
04:57:11,920 --> 04:57:12,753
you're giving me the fire.
I need to go achieve this situation 

6910
04:57:16,731 --> 04:57:18,410
because we got a lease on the building.

6911
04:57:19,420 --> 04:57:20,253
I'm not going to give you false hope 
when it comes to putting out a lot of 

6912
04:57:22,661 --> 04:57:23,150
money,

6913
04:57:23,150 --> 04:57:24,890
but you know what though?
False hope.

6914
04:57:25,380 --> 04:57:30,380
A hope floats hope.

6915
04:57:31,640 --> 04:57:33,680
Okay,
tonight I'm ending the call.

6916
04:57:33,681 --> 04:57:37,130
I'm not going to give you false hope and
I don't want you to waste your money.

6917
04:57:37,440 --> 04:57:40,560
What about Bob Hope?
Would you give me a little Bob Hope?

6918
04:57:40,590 --> 04:57:43,170
Let me just hear it.
Everyone can do a good bob hope.

6919
04:57:45,600 --> 04:57:46,433
Okay.

6920
04:57:47,090 --> 04:57:49,400
$5 an hour.
You're going to turn that down.

6921
04:57:49,980 --> 04:57:52,190
$5 a minute.
I think we lost her.

6922
04:57:52,230 --> 04:57:54,680
Yo.
I have to say I'm depressed that she was

6923
04:57:54,681 --> 04:57:57,560
pretty honest later just to give you 
good advice,

6924
04:57:57,620 --> 04:57:58,453
but like I said,
like it sounds like you're the 

6925
04:57:59,990 --> 04:58:02,150
connection wise with money were no 
longer being,

6926
04:58:02,210 --> 04:58:03,860
oh,
so she ended the call.

6927
04:58:04,240 --> 04:58:05,073
Maybe I noticed it in a way too still.
She was taking advantage of a man who 

6928
04:58:09,481 --> 04:58:12,680
had gone bankrupt who crawled through it
now for some reason,

6929
04:58:13,210 --> 04:58:15,740
just think his life savings into it.
Chuck e cheese.

6930
04:58:15,790 --> 04:58:17,570
He was a decent lady.
Oh by the way,

6931
04:58:17,571 --> 04:58:18,404
no offense to chuck e cheese,
although I do think you've got to bring 

6932
04:58:20,391 --> 04:58:23,000
back those animatronics was in the ball 
pit.

6933
04:58:23,540 --> 04:58:26,060
Do you know what can we each do one of 
those?

6934
04:58:26,090 --> 04:58:27,190
Oh man,
this,

6935
04:58:27,200 --> 04:58:27,950
yeah,
please.

6936
04:58:27,950 --> 04:58:30,440
Versus wait two hours to you.
I'll do one by the way,

6937
04:58:30,441 --> 04:58:32,290
by the way,
how much,

6938
04:58:32,310 --> 04:58:33,740
what was the total on that call?

6939
04:58:33,740 --> 04:58:34,573
How long?
How long?

6940
04:58:34,770 --> 04:58:35,603
What did that cost delight?
So the introductory rate is a dollar as 

6941
04:58:38,720 --> 04:58:40,280
president and we can't,
we can't hear Dan.

6942
04:58:40,450 --> 04:58:41,141
Hold on.
There you go.

6943
04:58:41,141 --> 04:58:43,970
And so the introductory rate is a a a 
dollar a minute.

6944
04:58:44,270 --> 04:58:46,010
Um,
but that's just for the first 30.

6945
04:58:46,011 --> 04:58:50,640
And then after that it's a $5 a fucking 
minute for the first 30 minutes.

6946
04:58:50,990 --> 04:58:53,120
So right now that was only a dollar a 
minute.

6947
04:58:53,170 --> 04:58:53,680
Oh,
okay.

6948
04:58:53,680 --> 04:58:55,190
So he,
she done shit.

6949
04:58:55,191 --> 04:58:56,600
How so?
How so what was that?

6950
04:58:56,601 --> 04:58:57,980
How many minutes was that?
Uh,

6951
04:58:58,250 --> 04:59:00,120
I think we had her on her about,
no,

6952
04:59:00,140 --> 04:59:01,460
it was less than that.
It was maybe 10.

6953
04:59:01,610 --> 04:59:02,391
Okay.
So hold on,

6954
04:59:02,391 --> 04:59:03,500
hold on.
Before we do that,

6955
04:59:03,680 --> 04:59:05,540
before we do that,
Aussie has the song cause it,

6956
04:59:05,570 --> 04:59:06,880
cause like people have paid for 
something.

6957
04:59:06,910 --> 04:59:08,210
So hold on.
Is it,

6958
04:59:08,650 --> 04:59:11,350
that took so long.
Is it going to be easy to connect now or

6959
04:59:11,370 --> 04:59:12,170
should you were caught up?

6960
04:59:12,170 --> 04:59:13,580
Now we're ready to just throw money.
Right.

6961
04:59:13,610 --> 04:59:14,570
Can you just,
can you,

6962
04:59:14,571 --> 04:59:17,180
should you start working on that and 
then Aussie will perform.

6963
04:59:18,400 --> 04:59:19,550
So we're working on what,
sorry,

6964
04:59:19,660 --> 04:59:21,320
we're on the next call because I want to
do one.

6965
04:59:21,590 --> 04:59:22,150
Oh,
you want him?

6966
04:59:22,150 --> 04:59:23,330
You want to call back?
Yeah.

6967
04:59:23,331 --> 04:59:24,270
Yeah,
we'll get,

6968
04:59:24,290 --> 04:59:27,560
I don't want to talk to Ron a callback.
It listens.

6969
04:59:27,561 --> 04:59:29,870
A roxy isn't like we're,
we're good guys.

6970
04:59:29,871 --> 04:59:31,250
We're almost a 75.
Come on.

6971
04:59:31,251 --> 04:59:32,160
Keep it calm.
And guys,

6972
04:59:33,400 --> 04:59:35,270
this is,
this is when the real fun starts.

6973
04:59:35,271 --> 04:59:39,020
Once we get to 75,
that's when it gets real wild and crazy.

6974
04:59:39,890 --> 04:59:40,370
Well,

6975
04:59:40,370 --> 04:59:43,000
if ozzy is ready to go,
I think we should probably do that.

6976
04:59:43,030 --> 04:59:43,870
Okay.
Go ahead.

6977
04:59:43,880 --> 04:59:44,840
Do that.
It's ready to go.

6978
04:59:44,890 --> 04:59:45,610
Okay.
All right.

6979
04:59:45,610 --> 04:59:46,700
So hold on.
Standby.

6980
04:59:46,760 --> 04:59:48,740
Let me make sure we get her audio setup.

6981
04:59:49,700 --> 04:59:52,600
Yup.
And ethical.

6982
04:59:53,740 --> 04:59:56,410
What's so for watch,
her vocation is,

6983
04:59:56,411 --> 04:59:58,540
was so sweet.
Are Ripping people off.

6984
04:59:58,570 --> 04:59:59,260
Yeah.
She's like,

6985
04:59:59,260 --> 05:00:01,080
I can't,
she ended the call.

6986
05:00:01,090 --> 05:00:03,820
Faith I'm going to do,
I think she may be really believes those

6987
05:00:03,821 --> 05:00:07,300
cards because she looked like don't do 
it.

6988
05:00:07,330 --> 05:00:08,530
It's not going to work.
And he's just like,

6989
05:00:08,850 --> 05:00:10,620
oh.
She's like,

6990
05:00:10,650 --> 05:00:12,190
Oh fuck what have I.
Oh wow.

6991
05:00:12,840 --> 05:00:13,750
Hey good.

6992
05:00:14,350 --> 05:00:16,060
Maybe to her it's not,
it's maybe I should,

6993
05:00:16,061 --> 05:00:18,160
uh,
maybe so much take [inaudible] home.

6994
05:00:18,520 --> 05:00:19,353
Save her.

6995
05:00:19,490 --> 05:00:21,410
Oof.
I think so as,

6996
05:00:21,480 --> 05:00:23,300
as Dan,
is that is that is,

6997
05:00:23,301 --> 05:00:24,420
that sounded good.
You let,

6998
05:00:24,470 --> 05:00:25,620
do you want to go home?
They look,

6999
05:00:25,890 --> 05:00:26,750
yeah,
it looks a whole lot.

7000
05:00:26,751 --> 05:00:27,584
Let me,
uh,

7001
05:00:27,950 --> 05:00:28,640
it's,
it's,

7002
05:00:28,640 --> 05:00:29,810
it's,
it's this Mike,

7003
05:00:29,811 --> 05:00:30,840
so,
yeah,

7004
05:00:30,850 --> 05:00:33,090
it's it there.
You don't even like that.

7005
05:00:34,280 --> 05:00:35,120
I don't know.
I think,

7006
05:00:35,150 --> 05:00:37,870
I think,
I think it's gotta be sort of like both,

7007
05:00:38,900 --> 05:00:40,010
just it again.
Yeah,

7008
05:00:40,011 --> 05:00:45,011
go ahead.
Okay.

7009
05:00:45,530 --> 05:00:47,970
That looks okay.
All right.

7010
05:00:48,070 --> 05:00:48,903
And by the way,
let us know if the audio sucks for the 

7011
05:00:50,831 --> 05:00:52,660
music.
Will keep adjusting.

7012
05:00:52,720 --> 05:00:53,553
We're,
we're figuring.

7013
05:00:55,340 --> 05:00:58,080
All right.
Uh,

7014
05:00:58,300 --> 05:00:59,680
whenever you're ready.

Close the door and we'll,

7016
05:01:00,791 --> 05:01:01,624
we'll dive in.

7017
05:01:01,820 --> 05:01:02,653
All right.
You Ready?

7018
05:01:04,500 --> 05:01:06,060
All right.
Here we go.

7019
05:01:06,660 --> 05:01:07,950
What is the song?
Could you tell us?

7020
05:01:12,660 --> 05:01:13,493
Okay,

7021
05:01:13,880 --> 05:01:15,210
Yeah.
All right.

7022
05:01:18,810 --> 05:01:20,460
MMM.

7023
05:01:34,670 --> 05:01:35,503
No.

7024
05:01:47,790 --> 05:01:48,623
Oh,

7025
05:01:48,960 --> 05:01:50,220
I take much.

7026
05:02:15,300 --> 05:02:16,300
Some stuff.

7027
05:02:36,400 --> 05:02:41,400
Uh,
maybe.

7028
05:02:48,990 --> 05:02:49,823
Huh?

7029
05:02:50,090 --> 05:02:51,770
She was like,
I'm just,

7030
05:02:54,500 --> 05:02:55,590
Oh man.

7031
05:03:07,980 --> 05:03:08,813
Smile.

7032
05:03:14,170 --> 05:03:14,970
Okay.

7033
05:03:14,970 --> 05:03:19,970
Oh,
it seems,

7034
05:03:40,720 --> 05:03:43,440
I don't know,
but somebody who did,

7035
05:03:43,660 --> 05:03:45,190
Dan who pay,
who,

7036
05:03:45,200 --> 05:03:48,100
what is a song called and who paid for 
it?

7037
05:03:48,720 --> 05:03:49,553
Like if super familiar for me.
Now the song definitely far away by 

7038
05:03:53,621 --> 05:03:58,621
black field.
It's called a far away by black field.

7039
05:03:58,991 --> 05:04:01,990
And that was a request from a Jack O v 
Daily.

7040
05:04:01,991 --> 05:04:05,210
So thank you very much for the $200 Jack
be daily.

7041
05:04:05,270 --> 05:04:06,103
All right,
so we're gonna let Aussie go out and 

7042
05:04:07,661 --> 05:04:09,160
learn.
Learn Song three.

7043
05:04:09,430 --> 05:04:12,430
So Isla I want to say first of all,
I want to say a couple things.

7044
05:04:12,760 --> 05:04:14,200
First of all,
Isla is going home.

7045
05:04:14,201 --> 05:04:16,090
She's not feeling well.
She's a soldier.

7046
05:04:16,300 --> 05:04:19,340
She made it all the way to 70,000
and that is,

7047
05:04:19,660 --> 05:04:20,860
Hey,
we're at 70,000

7048
05:04:20,861 --> 05:04:23,860
by the way,
and we are inching our way.

7049
05:04:24,160 --> 05:04:25,020
I heard that,
uh,

7050
05:04:25,150 --> 05:04:28,180
some people were unable to donate 
through the website for some reason,

7051
05:04:28,181 --> 05:04:29,014
so thank you to everyone that's stuck 
through the frustration of trying to 

7052
05:04:31,660 --> 05:04:32,290
donate.

7053
05:04:32,290 --> 05:04:34,000
Yeah,
no wonder it's a,

7054
05:04:34,001 --> 05:04:36,010
it's an issue with mobile.
So yeah.

7055
05:04:36,011 --> 05:04:36,844
Yeah.
We looked at some tweets and I people 

7056
05:04:38,141 --> 05:04:40,000
that are tracking is what I was going 
through.

7057
05:04:40,001 --> 05:04:40,834
Yeah.
So I'm,

7058
05:04:40,900 --> 05:04:41,733
I'm reaching out to tilt by and I'm like
Ethan said we are keeping this open for 

7059
05:04:45,491 --> 05:04:46,324
a week at least.
I think you should double that because 

7060
05:04:47,950 --> 05:04:48,870
just for,
yeah,

7061
05:04:48,910 --> 05:04:51,450
for the fact that we've had issues 
because we would,

7062
05:04:51,460 --> 05:04:53,440
we would be at a hundred right now if it
weren't for it.

7063
05:04:53,450 --> 05:04:54,283
Cause I think easily,
I feel like I feel like 90% of the 

7064
05:04:56,411 --> 05:04:57,244
people are on there.
Well maybe that's not true but I would 

7065
05:04:59,501 --> 05:05:00,600
be,
most people are on their phones.

7066
05:05:01,350 --> 05:05:02,930
Even if I was watching it on,
on my,

7067
05:05:03,400 --> 05:05:04,780
at home,
on my laptop,

7068
05:05:04,781 --> 05:05:06,750
I would be trying to donate on my phone.
Yeah,

7069
05:05:06,820 --> 05:05:09,430
100% for sure.
If you guys keep trying.

7070
05:05:09,431 --> 05:05:10,264
Thank you so much.
And also I do want to say to all the 

7071
05:05:12,731 --> 05:05:14,020
people giving one,
two,

7072
05:05:14,021 --> 05:05:14,621
three,
four,

7073
05:05:14,621 --> 05:05:17,650
$5 how much we,
that all makes it dead.

7074
05:05:17,651 --> 05:05:18,381
Still Matters.
Yeah.

7075
05:05:18,381 --> 05:05:22,270
We appreciate it.
You fucking don't listen to cheat by the

7076
05:05:22,280 --> 05:05:23,410
way.
I also want to stay,

7077
05:05:23,411 --> 05:05:24,244
you know,
last year we did this in September but 

7078
05:05:26,111 --> 05:05:26,944
this is right before Christmas.
People have already tapped their bank 

7079
05:05:29,351 --> 05:05:30,410
account,
you know,

7080
05:05:30,540 --> 05:05:31,373
oh,
everyone is big in super deep and 

7081
05:05:32,981 --> 05:05:35,140
helping us raise,
we've already at 70,000

7082
05:05:35,440 --> 05:05:36,040

7083
05:05:36,040 --> 05:05:38,880
incredible.
You guys are so selfless and so amazing.

7084
05:05:38,900 --> 05:05:41,470
That's a ton of money we've already 
raised for charity.

7085
05:05:41,620 --> 05:05:42,453
So everybody who keeps trying,
everybody who has donated from $1 even 

7086
05:05:46,151 --> 05:05:48,250
and beyond.
I thank you all so much.

7087
05:05:48,251 --> 05:05:49,150
Every,
I mean it really,

7088
05:05:49,240 --> 05:05:51,040
it's all money man.
It all matters.

7089
05:05:51,041 --> 05:05:53,170
So thank you guys so much.
And we're so close.

7090
05:05:53,390 --> 05:05:53,870
So

7091
05:05:53,870 --> 05:05:56,330
close to that 75 baby.
I can taste it.

7092
05:05:56,600 --> 05:05:57,470
Yeah,
we're going to get there.

7093
05:05:57,471 --> 05:05:59,120
So I don't want to,
I say,

7094
05:05:59,121 --> 05:06:03,110
I say we do it.
I say we stick with it and um,

you know,
I know Ilos gone,

7096

weird vibe to the,

7097
05:06:08,870 --> 05:06:10,750
it's weird to the,
it's all weird.

05:08:51,381 --> 05:08:52,214
we're almost there.
Somebody has the novel idea in the 

7165
05:08:55,341 --> 05:08:57,230
Aussie songs.
That's wonderful.

7166
05:08:57,500 --> 05:08:58,920
If she could just,
she hasn't,

7167
05:08:59,030 --> 05:09:03,200
she hasn't played these songs before and
just like not even heard of them.

7168
05:09:03,370 --> 05:09:04,210
She'd be like,
just went out.

7169
05:09:04,240 --> 05:09:06,200
Listen to her once on her phone.
Man Powers.

7170
05:09:06,480 --> 05:09:07,600
It's crazy.
She's,

7171
05:09:07,760 --> 05:09:10,250
she doesn't realize how talented she is.
Hey,

7172
05:09:10,251 --> 05:09:12,110
by the way,
I got a new original piece of art.

7173
05:09:12,230 --> 05:09:13,800
Oh my God.
What?

7174
05:09:13,900 --> 05:09:14,970
How long we would have full

7175
05:09:17,400 --> 05:09:20,560
that we're going to put up for auction.
Just want to love and be loved.

7176
05:09:20,561 --> 05:09:23,230
Accept me for who I am.

7179
05:09:27,520 --> 05:09:28,353

throughout the week just tweeting like 

7180
05:09:30,641 --> 05:09:31,141

7181
05:09:31,141 --> 05:09:33,480
our work with a link to the donate page.

7182
05:09:33,640 --> 05:09:36,960
Me That's going to be raffled off.
So you know,

7183
05:09:37,290 --> 05:09:38,230
let's get it one.
It,

7184
05:09:38,231 --> 05:09:40,050
should I color it?
Fuck yeah,

7185
05:09:40,270 --> 05:09:41,970
sure.
I coloring is like my most,

7186
05:09:42,000 --> 05:09:43,980
my least favorite part of it.
It all depends though.

7187
05:09:43,981 --> 05:09:46,470
I was asked to draft Freddy Freaker.
Do you know Freddy Freaker?

7188
05:09:46,740 --> 05:09:47,620
Do you know?
That's fucking wait,

7189
05:09:47,630 --> 05:09:49,170
you've never seen Freddie freaker 
before?

7190
05:09:51,120 --> 05:09:52,880
Neither of you guys know what Freddy 
freakers.

7191
05:09:52,910 --> 05:09:53,970
Oh,
you got to pull this up.

7192
05:09:53,971 --> 05:09:56,520
It only takes two seconds to watch.
This is just the weirdest fucking video.

7193
05:09:56,550 --> 05:09:58,200
So like,
and I'm lining up another second.

7194
05:09:58,201 --> 05:09:59,360
Great.
Now by the way,

7195
05:09:59,720 --> 05:10:02,120
the other a face tat core request I saw.

7196
05:10:02,320 --> 05:10:05,410
Oh hundreds.
We'll take a look at that as well.

7197
05:10:05,800 --> 05:10:06,633
Alrighty.
Is there a way to give Sarah access so 

7198
05:10:07,871 --> 05:10:09,460
she can just what?
I know she's,

7199
05:10:09,461 --> 05:10:11,290
she's been filling it out.
In other words were,

7200
05:10:11,430 --> 05:10:12,430
you know,
we got a couple of cake,

7201
05:10:12,431 --> 05:10:13,211
right?
Uh,

7202
05:10:13,211 --> 05:10:14,830
Freddy free.
Let me set this up.

7203
05:10:14,831 --> 05:10:16,630
So Freddy Freaker.
Oh Wow.

7204
05:10:16,631 --> 05:10:18,430
Look at this.
This is kind of creepy.

7205
05:10:18,431 --> 05:10:21,010
Yeah,
there used to be Justin,

7206
05:10:21,011 --> 05:10:22,210
you've never seen this thing before.

7207
05:10:22,860 --> 05:10:23,171
Wait,
wait,

7208
05:10:23,171 --> 05:10:24,004
hit pause.
A pause.

7209
05:10:25,030 --> 05:10:28,320
I just wanna I just wanna explain like 
in the fucking,

7210
05:10:28,350 --> 05:10:29,610
like what?
Like late,

7211
05:10:29,700 --> 05:10:31,920
late eighties maybe like they,
you know,

7212
05:10:31,921 --> 05:10:34,470
they would do these like phone sex.
Sure they had that.

7213
05:10:34,471 --> 05:10:37,260
But also they were like anything we can 
do boggling.

7214
05:10:37,261 --> 05:10:39,190
It's like call them any,
exactly.

7215
05:10:39,191 --> 05:10:41,430
You'd be like,
talk to the fucking toy.

7216
05:10:41,431 --> 05:10:43,450
I bought it with the garbage pail 
grants.

7217
05:10:43,590 --> 05:10:44,460
Right.
And so they were just,

7218
05:10:44,461 --> 05:10:48,180
they kept making these up and this,
this one was very brief.

7219
05:10:48,210 --> 05:10:49,043
Like it only existed briefly as one of 
these and people saw it like at two in 

7220
05:10:51,241 --> 05:10:53,190
the morning and they thought like,
was I hallucinating?

7221
05:10:53,400 --> 05:10:56,190
Because it's not clear what they're 
advertising or trying to sell.

7222
05:10:56,191 --> 05:10:58,140
And then it was just gone.
And until the Internet,

7223
05:10:58,141 --> 05:10:59,760
like a lot of people out there,
we're just like,

7224
05:10:59,790 --> 05:11:01,680
I think I was losing my mind.
All right,

7225
05:11:01,681 --> 05:11:03,480
let's,
let's watch the free phone.

7226
05:11:05,030 --> 05:11:06,680
All my fucking,
wow.

7227
05:11:07,090 --> 05:11:09,310
You nailed it.
By the way,

7228
05:11:09,380 --> 05:11:10,213
by the way,
I was looking at some references and a 

7229
05:11:11,361 --> 05:11:13,540
little greener.
But is there,

7230
05:11:13,580 --> 05:11:14,820
what's that?
A person with a fingers.

7231
05:11:14,890 --> 05:11:16,280
Listen,
the sweet song,

7232
05:11:19,080 --> 05:11:20,780
why do you,
why are you calling?

7233
05:11:20,781 --> 05:11:25,520
What are you calling for?
This exists now wound up Chicago.

7234
05:11:25,530 --> 05:11:27,810
All these curious.
Yes.

7235
05:11:30,440 --> 05:11:31,980
$2 car and

7236
05:11:31,980 --> 05:11:32,940
then he disappears.
Yeah.

7237
05:11:32,941 --> 05:11:34,620
That's pretty freaky.
And that's all you know.

7238
05:11:34,621 --> 05:11:36,510
So is it just a goof too.
Dot.

7239
05:11:36,900 --> 05:11:37,733
They're really trying to get people to 
call to talk to Freddy Freaker and what 

7240
05:11:40,231 --> 05:11:41,790
they're promising is,
uh,

7241
05:11:42,020 --> 05:11:43,860
it's the free phone.
He's the party freak.

7242
05:11:43,920 --> 05:11:46,590
Freddie freaker across the nation.
He's a sensation.

7243
05:11:46,620 --> 05:11:47,510
Call now.
$2.

7244
05:11:47,590 --> 05:11:52,140
All this is a drug only information.
Like a message.

7245
05:11:52,141 --> 05:11:54,150
Like there's no one else cause it's $2 
per call.

7246
05:11:54,300 --> 05:11:56,220
So they probably just play your 
prerecorded.

7247
05:11:56,700 --> 05:11:59,820
Hey there.
Welcome to the freak zone.

7248
05:12:00,030 --> 05:12:01,500
We'll come to the party.
Yeah,

7249
05:12:01,520 --> 05:12:04,440
it's fucking pretty cute.
Let me talk to her.

7250
05:12:04,710 --> 05:12:07,230
Just some pervy guy who calls himself 
Freddy Freaker.

7251
05:12:07,730 --> 05:12:10,380
But what if he tells you where the 
hotspots are to buy drugs?

7252
05:12:10,381 --> 05:12:12,800
He's,
it's like a,

7253
05:12:12,801 --> 05:12:15,090
the the,
the Alex Jones voice.

7254
05:12:15,091 --> 05:12:15,924
Someone said,
I've got,

7255
05:12:16,320 --> 05:12:17,570
now let me tell you,
uh,

7256
05:12:18,090 --> 05:12:19,530
now,
Freddy Freaker a lot of people.

7257
05:12:19,570 --> 05:12:21,210
Good.
Not a lot of people say that.

7258
05:12:21,211 --> 05:12:22,044
Fray.
The freaker is the life of the party 

7259
05:12:22,921 --> 05:12:23,754
now.
He now freddy barely takes enough 

7260
05:12:29,450 --> 05:12:30,283
happens to me when I do the record here.
Maybe that the rep boy impression or 

7261
05:12:34,581 --> 05:12:36,370
not.
I can't cook.

7262
05:12:36,720 --> 05:12:38,130
He does cough.
A fair amount.

7263
05:12:38,460 --> 05:12:39,520
Alex Jones.
Yeah.

7264
05:12:39,990 --> 05:12:42,120
Every now and then there's a free 
course,

7265
05:12:42,121 --> 05:12:43,980
a Goblin.
Goblin blood.

7266
05:12:43,981 --> 05:12:46,400
What's up Joey?

7267
05:12:47,220 --> 05:12:49,680
Now Joey have a seat here because Joey 
Salads here.

7268
05:12:49,681 --> 05:12:51,090
He's a good man.
Now he,

7269
05:12:51,590 --> 05:12:52,423
we're tattooing on him,
but really what's in this tattoo is 

7270
05:12:54,751 --> 05:12:55,584
going to turn.
It's going to make your penis small and 

7271
05:12:57,331 --> 05:12:59,220
that's why you need to be taking on.
Oh,

7272
05:12:59,250 --> 05:13:01,780
well joey letting out the globalist will
happen.

7273
05:13:02,740 --> 05:13:03,573
Don't be shy.
We're going to get your butthole ripped 

7274
05:13:06,061 --> 05:13:10,520
out out.
Joe got Corn is not joe.

7275
05:13:10,540 --> 05:13:12,870
We've got a supplement here.
It's made of,

7276
05:13:12,871 --> 05:13:13,704
uh,
what,

7277
05:13:13,780 --> 05:13:18,030
what we do is we grind up kidney stones 
made from about Korean baby fortune.

7278
05:13:18,240 --> 05:13:19,073
And what you do is you take that and it 
lifts your testosterone levels so high 

7279
05:13:23,160 --> 05:13:28,160
that basically your penis are going to 
blast out of your pants like a rocket to

7280
05:13:29,161 --> 05:13:30,310
the moon.
Man,

7281
05:13:30,360 --> 05:13:33,510
I never actually went into the movement.
This will make your penis.

7282
05:13:33,511 --> 05:13:36,210
Well Kayla goober bake that for the 
resident of this guy.

7283
05:13:36,240 --> 05:13:39,940
That's the best impression in the room.
Sorry,

7284
05:13:39,950 --> 05:13:41,490
the keys to just,
uh,

7285
05:13:41,520 --> 05:13:43,410
you know,
just lit up really badly.

7286
05:13:43,720 --> 05:13:46,270
Now.
What did he say about the church?

7287
05:13:46,280 --> 05:13:51,280
But you got something to write it up.
Don't be shy now destroyed the child.

7288
05:13:51,930 --> 05:13:52,763
Don't be shy.
Bot Mitchell's looking real good over 

7289
05:13:55,021 --> 05:13:56,100
there now,
but look,

7290
05:13:56,150 --> 05:13:58,870
I'm real fine or whatever that do I 
needed to grant,

7291
05:13:59,270 --> 05:14:01,200
uh,
that was me or no,

7292
05:14:01,201 --> 05:14:02,370
that wasn't you.
That was Alex.

7293
05:14:03,300 --> 05:14:03,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

7294
05:14:03,850 --> 05:14:04,683
Shredder or I mean shredder,
frankly speaking now that was Freddie 

7295
05:14:07,020 --> 05:14:07,740
freaker.
Now,

7296
05:14:07,740 --> 05:14:08,573
now,
now the coastal liberals will have you 

7297
05:14:11,401 --> 05:14:13,950
believe that?
Uh No joey,

7298
05:14:13,951 --> 05:14:15,960
why are you laughing?
Because you know now Joey,

7299
05:14:16,020 --> 05:14:20,310
cause Alex Jones is hilarious.
Not hilarious.

7300
05:14:20,311 --> 05:14:22,860
This is serious and I know I'm trying to
warm the people.

7301
05:14:22,861 --> 05:14:24,820
I put it in a humble [inaudible] of him 
up just doing the,

7302
05:14:24,840 --> 05:14:29,830
you don't need a copulation sorry.

7303
05:14:31,170 --> 05:14:32,860
I like the one person who asks for 
Freddy.

7304
05:14:32,861 --> 05:14:35,080
Freaker is definitely not going to see 
that this drawing is there.

7305
05:14:35,950 --> 05:14:36,783
I just love that this is,
this is in there for the one person 

7306
05:14:38,321 --> 05:14:39,154
who's heard of this thing.
I would have sworn that you guys would 

7307
05:14:40,661 --> 05:14:42,060
know what that is.
I never heard.

7308
05:14:42,061 --> 05:14:42,894
It's so fucking weird.
And there's like a puppet tier guy who 

7309
05:14:44,471 --> 05:14:45,304
like look on reddit explaining like,
oh I'm the one who designed pretty 

7310
05:14:47,861 --> 05:14:49,390
frequent.
I don't know why.

7311
05:14:49,391 --> 05:14:50,610
Like the people who paid me,
they never do

7312
05:14:50,650 --> 05:14:54,550
told me what it was.
It was a device by liberals to brainwash

7313
05:14:54,551 --> 05:14:55,384
the kids you call a bop to party.
But what they're actually doing is that 

7314
05:14:58,451 --> 05:15:00,910
they're whispering this liberal messages
from another dimension.

7315
05:15:01,210 --> 05:15:03,070
Right.
And they're company in your ear and what

7316
05:15:03,071 --> 05:15:04,090
is just doing as a target?
Neat.

7317
05:15:04,220 --> 05:15:05,590
Our kids,
transsexual.

7318
05:15:05,800 --> 05:15:07,870
Okay.
And kids are chopping off their penises.

7319
05:15:07,871 --> 05:15:08,704
They're tucking.
The penis is in there growing vaginas 

7320
05:15:10,360 --> 05:15:13,900
and it's all Freddie Freaker is,
is spreading subliminal messages.

7321
05:15:14,410 --> 05:15:17,190
You know,
I know Hillary Clinton frog and it's not

7322
05:15:17,210 --> 05:15:21,600
furby greater this monstrosity.
Oh,

7323
05:15:21,610 --> 05:15:24,010
knows he's on campuses.
He's destroying free speech.

7324
05:15:24,250 --> 05:15:25,870
He just wants people to call the free 
catiline.

7325
05:15:26,150 --> 05:15:27,790
Frankly,
he sounds like a cool guy.

7326
05:15:28,330 --> 05:15:30,430
Oh,
you call that fruit hotline?

7327
05:15:31,050 --> 05:15:32,070
Oh my God.
Joey,

7328
05:15:32,470 --> 05:15:34,230
what was getting sick?
This is gone sexual,

7329
05:15:34,770 --> 05:15:36,800
I mean need is back to,
yeah.

7330
05:15:36,960 --> 05:15:39,570
Can we show that we are really backed up
on writing.

7331
05:15:39,870 --> 05:15:40,703
We've got to stay on top of this.
We need to be a character limit because 

7332
05:15:42,901 --> 05:15:45,280
it's like the writing full paragraphs.
Yeah.

7333
05:15:45,490 --> 05:15:46,323
Well whatever it is,
it actually that it expired at eight 

7334
05:15:48,421 --> 05:15:50,280
o'clock so we're getting caught up right
here.

7335

7337
05:15:57,960 --> 05:15:59,810

just a second.

7338
05:16:00,160 --> 05:16:00,993

7342
05:16:07,261 --> 05:16:09,360

7346
05:16:26,530 --> 05:16:27,363

Yep.

sorry.

7358
05:17:05,960 --> 05:17:09,600
So we are waiting for Dan to connect us.
He told us it's connecting,

7359
05:17:09,601 --> 05:17:10,620
but nothing's happening.

7360
05:17:15,530 --> 05:17:16,363
Okay.

7361
05:17:16,550 --> 05:17:20,940
What is it takes so fucking long for 
these cause they charged by the matthew.

7362
05:17:21,000 --> 05:17:21,833
These psychics.
It's like they're taking your $5 a 

7363
05:17:23,981 --> 05:17:25,720
minute.
She talks super slow.

7364
05:17:25,721 --> 05:17:28,040
Did you notice till he,
didn't he do it to

7365
05:17:28,040 --> 05:17:30,920
weed out people like us?
People like us or like they're listening

7366
05:17:31,100 --> 05:17:32,240
on our money,
right?

7367
05:17:32,450 --> 05:17:33,283
That's what I'm saying.
What do they care if they're getting 

7368
05:17:33,951 --> 05:17:35,290
pranked?
Yeah.

7369
05:17:36,950 --> 05:17:38,240
Oh,

7370
05:17:38,241 --> 05:17:41,870

In all seriousness.

7371
05:17:41,871 --> 05:17:44,900
I really do want to do one of these 
where it's like super,

7372
05:17:44,901 --> 05:17:47,230

7377
05:17:54,260 --> 05:17:56,190

7378
05:17:56,390 --> 05:17:58,760
super serious and like see how,
how close they are.

7379
05:17:59,780 --> 05:18:01,240
I think,
I think you guys blew it.

7380
05:18:01,270 --> 05:18:02,920
I was trying to get you to be quiet.
She,

7381
05:18:02,930 --> 05:18:06,530
it was ringing and she heard you.
I never heard the colgate connect yet,

7382
05:18:06,531 --> 05:18:07,364
but I know but she said hello and I 
connected it and you guys were in the 

7383
05:18:09,851 --> 05:18:11,980
midst of saying these fucking psychic,

7384
05:18:15,100 --> 05:18:16,840
well let's get another one on the far 
right.

7385
05:18:16,850 --> 05:18:18,990
I'll work on another one.
When I say it's going to come,

7386
05:18:19,130 --> 05:18:19,963
we got it.
We got to just stand by for a second 

7387
05:18:20,931 --> 05:18:22,370
cause they,
that she will be coming.

7388
05:18:23,130 --> 05:18:23,963
Dan,
can you just pipe in on your mic and 

7389
05:18:26,311 --> 05:18:26,851
just say,
all right,

7390
05:18:26,851 --> 05:18:28,980
I'm about to connect just so we know to 
shut the fuck up.

7391
05:18:29,700 --> 05:18:30,533
Oh he did.
But it was like we had like a couple of 

7392
05:18:32,570 --> 05:18:35,210
minutes of silence but no,
but it's got a ring on it be like right,

7393
05:18:35,300 --> 05:18:35,940
okay.
It's,

7394
05:18:35,940 --> 05:18:38,910
it starts ringing and so any moments you
might pick up.

7395
05:18:38,990 --> 05:18:39,890
Got It.
Okay.

7396
05:18:39,891 --> 05:18:43,570
Theoretically it was a different one.
I think these probably work for me.

7397
05:18:45,110 --> 05:18:47,300
Yeah.
So it probably got to be some lady.

7398
05:18:47,360 --> 05:18:48,810
God bless and God bless him.
What,

7399
05:18:48,811 --> 05:18:49,311
what,
what,

7400
05:18:49,311 --> 05:18:50,510
what?
I will try,

7401
05:18:50,511 --> 05:18:54,020
I will try a different lady because uh,
because we blew our cover on that one.

7402
05:18:54,210 --> 05:18:55,790
Dang it.
I was sorry that was my bad

7403
05:18:56,330 --> 05:18:58,610
fault.
I'll take the full responsible blame for

7404
05:18:58,611 --> 05:18:59,380
that

7405
05:18:59,380 --> 05:19:01,720
guys.
We are nearing on 72,000

7406
05:19:01,721 --> 05:19:05,330
we are surging more.
Is there any face,

7407
05:19:05,800 --> 05:19:06,633
whoa.
Let me get a close up that this one is 

7408
05:19:09,011 --> 05:19:09,810
amazing.

7409
05:19:09,810 --> 05:19:12,630
So this one's for all you folks out 
there that are,

7410
05:19:13,860 --> 05:19:15,810
you know,
just want to supply.

7411
05:19:15,811 --> 05:19:16,644
That looks awesome.
I want to support you want to support 

7412
05:19:18,300 --> 05:19:20,520
the right side of the debate.

7413
05:19:20,580 --> 05:19:22,320
Do you want to be on the right side of 
history here?

7414
05:19:22,620 --> 05:19:25,460
I love that.
It's pretty much no matter who he,

7415
05:19:25,470 --> 05:19:27,540
who buys a lumps on the right side of 
the debate.

7416
05:19:28,220 --> 05:19:29,550
I'm a fan.
I'm a fan of,

7417
05:19:29,551 --> 05:19:33,330
of creating art.
That is that either side,

7418
05:19:33,800 --> 05:19:36,390
that either side could get behind and 
go,

7419
05:19:36,391 --> 05:19:39,450
you know what works for me and listening
to the audio.

7420
05:19:39,451 --> 05:19:41,370
And if you are,
and you've made it this deep,

7421
05:19:41,400 --> 05:19:45,560
I don't know how that's possible,
but he's drawn a man with the,

7428
05:20:02,411 --> 05:20:04,390
that's offensive.
It's a thing.

7429
05:20:05,590 --> 05:20:09,070
It's a thing is intense.
You person being joey,

7444
05:20:45,750 --> 05:20:46,583
Okay,

7445
05:20:48,031 --> 05:20:48,864
days,

it's a,
it's a one,

7449
05:20:54,590 --> 05:20:57,120
a real talented.
This is 18 days.

7450
05:20:57,121 --> 05:20:59,820
So this is basically like,
I will draw it on you.

7451
05:20:59,880 --> 05:21:01,650
Not My thing.
Why not?

7452
05:21:01,651 --> 05:21:05,490

By the way,

7493
05:23:22,700 --> 05:23:24,850
Go to a different psychic.com

7494
05:23:25,240 --> 05:23:26,110
Hey guys,

inkbox hang up right here.

every time.

7498
05:23:33,460 --> 05:23:36,190
One person Mac thing.
That's pretty cool.

7499
05:23:36,510 --> 05:23:36,831
Yeah.
Right.

7500
05:23:36,831 --> 05:23:38,980
So what do you put it on me?
I don't think it's,

7501
05:23:39,210 --> 05:23:42,580
I don't think if I give $1,000,
you could just sharpie your whole face.

7502
05:23:42,581 --> 05:23:46,760
Black.
Can anyone to see this mean black face,

7503
05:23:47,480 --> 05:23:48,820
black face,
sharpie face.

7504
05:23:50,020 --> 05:23:51,850
Oh,
you don't show it on yours.

7505
05:23:52,930 --> 05:23:54,280
So what,
what this,

7506
05:23:54,520 --> 05:23:55,450
what that is,
is that,

7507
05:23:55,451 --> 05:23:56,860
that that's a,
that's a,

7508
05:23:56,861 --> 05:23:57,694
um,
that's a tattoo that you can put on 

7509
05:24:00,221 --> 05:24:04,670

Um,

7510
05:24:05,290 --> 05:24:06,123

7511

And so,

7512

7521

suffering here over,

7522
05:24:42,220 --> 05:24:44,540
although joey will just be entering.
Yeah.

7523
05:24:45,790 --> 05:24:47,500
Okay.
So I swear to God,

7524
05:24:48,130 --> 05:24:51,520
can you ask the team out there?
Was there any other baggies like this in

7525
05:24:51,521 --> 05:24:52,480
this box?
So if you guys,

7526
05:24:52,720 --> 05:24:54,340
Roger that is,
do we have any more of this?

7527
05:24:54,670 --> 05:24:55,810
No.
Yeah,

7528
05:24:55,811 --> 05:24:58,230
I think there was just that one and then
a bunch of the,

7529
05:24:58,240 --> 05:24:59,510
uh,
by the way,

7530
05:25:00,250 --> 05:25:01,210

7531
05:25:01,210 --> 05:25:04,640
So we're going to hit 75 k tonight.
We're 3000 away.

7532
05:25:04,641 --> 05:25:07,960

hot pepper and I will give him a free 

7534
05:25:13,071 --> 05:25:16,120

Well,

7535
05:25:16,121 --> 05:25:16,954

last 18 days and he'll take a photo of 

7536
05:25:22,781 --> 05:25:24,220

7539
05:25:27,011 --> 05:25:28,120

this is the lead.

7540
05:25:28,150 --> 05:25:29,950

05:25:34,120 --> 05:25:34,953
Would you let me do a swastika?
Still just be a bunch of dis for 10 

7544
05:25:37,571 --> 05:25:38,381
days.
18 days.

7545
05:25:38,381 --> 05:25:41,230
Hell,
it's just going to be a bunch of dicks.

7546
05:25:41,231 --> 05:25:42,064
That's,
but anyway,

7547
05:25:42,310 --> 05:25:45,070
so we're going to hit a hundred what?
The vod,

7548
05:25:45,280 --> 05:25:46,720
so joey's going to do one of these.

7549
05:25:46,720 --> 05:25:51,100
When we hit 75 he's going to take this 
bag of Carolina reapers with him through

7550
05:25:51,101 --> 05:25:55,450
the airport and while on the plane.
Ooh.

7551
05:25:55,451 --> 05:25:58,480
Would you do that on the plane?
Oh my God,

7552
05:25:58,600 --> 05:25:59,890
Joey.
Oh Dude,

7553
05:25:59,891 --> 05:26:01,600
you better not that my book.
That might be,

7554
05:26:01,601 --> 05:26:03,550
that might be too dangerous because 
Andrew's,

7555
05:26:03,900 --> 05:26:04,480
yeah.
Yeah.

7556
05:26:04,480 --> 05:26:05,170
Don't,
don't,

7557
05:26:05,170 --> 05:26:07,600
don't do when you're in the fucking,
you're in the air,

7558
05:26:08,080 --> 05:26:10,020
the pool full of milk,
wherever you do this.

7559
05:26:10,030 --> 05:26:13,150
That's very important.
At the time of your choosing,

7560
05:26:13,180 --> 05:26:14,680
we are going to give you this whole last
hour,

7561
05:26:15,120 --> 05:26:18,970
it's going to record himself and send it
to us so that we could on Friday when we

7562
05:26:18,971 --> 05:26:21,890
did the recap on,
enjoyed the video of joey

7563
05:26:22,040 --> 05:26:23,540
living,
living up to his,

7564
05:26:23,600 --> 05:26:25,250
his honorable name.
He's an honor.

7565
05:26:25,700 --> 05:26:27,050
I'm going to do some try to live up to 
it.

7566
05:26:27,520 --> 05:26:29,560
We're searching.
We're searching things.

7567
05:26:29,630 --> 05:26:31,220
You all come on.
Thank you.

7568
05:26:31,500 --> 05:26:32,990
How about we're getting there.
We're getting there.

7569
05:26:32,991 --> 05:26:33,824
We're getting close,
strong guys talking right now to see if 

7570
05:26:35,211 --> 05:26:40,211
there's any last plop that money hours I
one or two songs.

7571
05:26:44,120 --> 05:26:48,860
All I want us to talk to a psychic man.
Do you want me to try it one more time?

7572
05:26:48,890 --> 05:26:52,250
Try it one more time Dan.
Try the other.

7573
05:26:52,300 --> 05:26:56,620
We are the,
they give us to this one more time.

7574
05:26:56,960 --> 05:26:59,980
Getting set up with the psychic thing.
I can't even tell you how crazy it was.

7575
05:26:59,981 --> 05:27:02,690
It was,
it was a 30 minute process and I bet,

7576
05:27:02,691 --> 05:27:03,524
and I bet you the reason for that is 
because the second they realize they're 

7577
05:27:06,950 --> 05:27:07,783
being fucked with,
they have the ability through that 

7578
05:27:09,381 --> 05:27:13,310
process to completely block you or,
or just like cut you off.

7579
05:27:13,330 --> 05:27:14,163
Right.
And I played it really cool when I was 

7580
05:27:14,571 --> 05:27:15,404
signing up.
I just,

7581
05:27:15,780 --> 05:27:16,613
he played at night so cool.
So I think we might've blown what it's 

7582
05:27:22,611 --> 05:27:26,990
just been justin like yelling at the 
time like got my box.

7583
05:27:27,020 --> 05:27:27,880
So Cy,
the way,

7584
05:27:27,890 --> 05:27:29,540
Ari,
I read your message.

7585
05:27:29,541 --> 05:27:32,560
Thank you so much for the donation.
God bless you know m and?

7586
05:27:32,640 --> 05:27:33,081
M?
Yes.

7587
05:27:33,081 --> 05:27:36,860
Weird Al's hairs.
Very good work or good work are also,

7588
05:27:36,861 --> 05:27:38,570
I'm still doing drawing requests,
so people,

7589
05:27:38,571 --> 05:27:41,690
if you want to draw in the crest,
donate what justin like Doug,

7590
05:27:41,691 --> 05:27:43,610
funny world.
You got to,

7591
05:27:43,700 --> 05:27:45,070
it looks a little like a doug.
Like,

7592
05:27:45,270 --> 05:27:46,103
yeah,
a nineties Nickelodeon for 100 bucks I 

7593
05:27:49,581 --> 05:27:50,414
will definitely draw anything,
but if you just want to make a request 

7594
05:27:52,701 --> 05:27:53,121
for,
you know,

7595
05:27:53,121 --> 05:27:55,310
a dollar five I might do it.
If I feel like it,

7596
05:27:56,060 --> 05:27:59,240
Ethan needs to dance bucks more for 
that.

7597
05:27:59,870 --> 05:28:03,290
I just want to talk to a psychic man.
Yeah,

7598
05:28:03,291 --> 05:28:07,370
I mean I'm really surprised that it's 
that hard to get ahold of them.

7599
05:28:07,371 --> 05:28:09,890
I'm surprised that they hang up on you.
It's like if you're a psychic,

7600
05:28:09,910 --> 05:28:12,410
your phone's not ringing off the hook.
You should be really excited.

7601
05:28:14,220 --> 05:28:16,550
Just let me fuck with you,
dude.

7602
05:28:16,580 --> 05:28:17,413
That lady could have still been on the 
line still getting those $5 every 

7603
05:28:19,760 --> 05:28:20,810
minute.
They don't care about the money.

7604
05:28:20,811 --> 05:28:22,790
They're dedicated and given people 
there.

7605
05:28:22,910 --> 05:28:24,870
You think it's all about the real big 
beat.

7606
05:28:24,890 --> 05:28:28,340
I'm starting to maybe think that list 
based on that.

7607
05:28:28,400 --> 05:28:30,170
That last girl was like,
I don't want to waste your money.

7608
05:28:30,171 --> 05:28:31,004
I'm hanging,
you know,

7609
05:28:31,070 --> 05:28:33,140
which is crazy.
I was blown away.

7610
05:28:33,680 --> 05:28:36,950
I don't want to waste your money is mind
blowing to me.

7611
05:28:37,250 --> 05:28:38,850
Let me tell you about these psychics 
sub.

7612
05:28:39,080 --> 05:28:39,913
A lot of people think that they're fake,
but every single one of them is real 

7613
05:28:42,390 --> 05:28:43,223
man.
Break it and consulted board parker 

7614
05:28:48,050 --> 05:28:50,000
brothers,
they are part of the Illuminati.

7615
05:28:51,470 --> 05:28:53,220
Destroyed the child.
Can't do that.

7616
05:28:53,221 --> 05:28:55,670
I kept you the super deep.
That's the hardest to do.

7617
05:28:58,580 --> 05:28:59,413
How does anyone do a voice that deep 
destroyed the child has an incredible 

7618
05:29:03,921 --> 05:29:05,030
voice.
He does have an amazing,

7619
05:29:06,440 --> 05:29:09,380
beautiful voice.
If he wasn't like a horrible,

7620
05:29:11,730 --> 05:29:12,563
I think he once said that he was,
he got a lot of offers to do trailers 

7621
05:29:16,011 --> 05:29:17,210
for movies.
Oh,

7622
05:29:17,211 --> 05:29:18,590
interesting.
Thank you Alex.

7623
05:29:19,530 --> 05:29:20,160
In a world

7624
05:29:20,160 --> 05:29:22,380
where you're writing them as cabin side 
pizza,

7625
05:29:23,550 --> 05:29:28,550
one man,
where is at Mr Beast.

7626
05:29:29,370 --> 05:29:30,600
I know.
Where's Mr Base?

7627
05:29:30,601 --> 05:29:32,580
We need to sponsor us.
You stick boy.

7628
05:29:32,850 --> 05:29:36,450
I think that's really,
really inspiring that they would ask for

7629
05:29:36,451 --> 05:29:38,040
that.
I,

7630
05:29:38,041 --> 05:29:42,330
if somebody donates $250 all dance to a 
song of their request,

7631
05:29:42,390 --> 05:29:44,670
I feel like I'm on a strip club.
How about that?

7632
05:29:44,700 --> 05:29:46,650
Sort of weird like it's the purple 
couch.

7633
05:29:47,460 --> 05:29:47,941
No,
no,

7634
05:29:47,941 --> 05:29:49,290
no.
It's the,

7635
05:29:49,291 --> 05:29:50,220
uh,
oh,

7636
05:29:50,221 --> 05:29:53,430
you want me to dance for you?
I need 250 bucks.

7637
05:29:53,880 --> 05:29:54,301
What?
I mean,

7638
05:29:54,301 --> 05:29:54,991
not,
not that,

7639
05:29:54,991 --> 05:29:57,480
but maybe script strip club.
Right.

7640
05:29:57,810 --> 05:29:59,270
It's like,
well shit.

7641
05:29:59,290 --> 05:30:01,710
I will show my Dick for $1,000
right now alive.

7642
05:30:02,820 --> 05:30:05,310
I will pay $1,000
for him not to show his Dick.

7643
05:30:05,520 --> 05:30:07,150
I will,
I will pay you have it.

7644
05:30:07,780 --> 05:30:08,820
Thanks.
All right,

7645
05:30:09,180 --> 05:30:11,430

You're a little peep.

7650
05:30:20,071 --> 05:30:23,340
Congrats on the pregnancy healer.
Alright.

7651
05:30:23,370 --> 05:30:24,210
Yeah.
If he's not here,

7652
05:30:24,211 --> 05:30:27,120
but I'll take it a little later.
Congratulations.

7653
05:30:27,210 --> 05:30:29,810
Good for you.
Heela alright,

7654
05:30:29,920 --> 05:30:32,690

Hildago as they say,

7655
05:30:34,010 --> 05:30:34,843
Oh,
do you want to bring out a thousand 

7656
05:30:36,030 --> 05:30:36,863
dollar donation?

7657
05:30:46,060 --> 05:30:46,893
Okay.

7658
05:30:48,420 --> 05:30:50,850
A friend of a mutual friend of ours,
uh,

7659
05:30:51,820 --> 05:30:55,520
clothes.
He wants to see your Dick fucking dope.

7660
05:30:57,060 --> 05:30:57,893
Yeah.
If you're willing to beat the top donor 

7661
05:31:00,340 --> 05:31:01,790

Um,

7662
05:31:01,810 --> 05:31:03,940

7663
05:31:03,970 --> 05:31:05,620
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

7664
05:31:06,920 --> 05:31:08,140
We're so close,
Shane.

7665
05:31:08,141 --> 05:31:09,520
That was amazing.
Oh my God.

7666
05:31:09,521 --> 05:31:11,660
Was the floats.
Y'All want to do it?

7667
05:31:11,680 --> 05:31:14,170
And you went here.

It,
you walked me out.

7676
05:31:52,681 --> 05:31:53,514
Honestly,
I feel like that was kind of the 

7677
05:31:53,821 --> 05:31:54,930
highlight of the stream,
man.

7678
05:31:55,210 --> 05:31:57,420
That's pretty exciting to work.
Fuck am I?

7679
05:31:57,450 --> 05:31:59,160
Wow.
That's amazing.

7680
05:31:59,280 --> 05:32:03,140
Like a Shitty,
this goddamn came through big.

7681
05:32:04,230 --> 05:32:06,090
Woke my ass up.
Yeah,

7682
05:32:06,091 --> 05:32:08,700
you got your second wind.
You ready for the next 10 hours?

7683
05:32:09,150 --> 05:32:09,990
I'd go,
dude,

7684
05:32:09,991 --> 05:32:14,820
it would take us to get to a hundred.
We just need 1,301

7685
05:32:15,510 --> 05:32:17,770
you guys,
this is stuff we're close.

7686
05:32:17,890 --> 05:32:18,070
This

7687
05:32:18,070 --> 05:32:20,770
is the worst fuck I need.
Like a regular fucking,

7688
05:32:20,950 --> 05:32:25,420
oh man.
Two 50 someone just gave a hundred.

7689
05:32:26,680 --> 05:32:28,570
What does this mean?
That means you're going to dance.

7690
05:32:28,600 --> 05:32:31,440
Oh,

Although it's gone.

7692
05:32:34,951 --> 05:32:37,230
They can't play soccer.
Yeah.

7693
05:32:37,240 --> 05:32:39,690
What are the rules you'll get?
Dude,

7694
05:32:39,700 --> 05:32:42,670
we're surging big time.
Anonymous.

7695
05:32:42,730 --> 05:32:43,563
Yo,

7696
05:32:43,780 --> 05:32:46,480
do we have any writings to do,
cause I see big donations here.

7697
05:32:46,481 --> 05:32:48,860
That's a great question.
Let's see.

7698
05:32:48,890 --> 05:32:49,481
Uh,

7699
05:32:49,481 --> 05:32:51,280
I just checked and uh,

7700
05:32:51,281 --> 05:32:53,920

This is just your love coming in,

7701
05:32:53,921 --> 05:32:54,754
right?
How are we getting on a queue for 

7702
05:32:55,451 --> 05:32:57,470
another psychic?
Uh,

7703
05:32:57,790 --> 05:33:00,460
I was about to call them and then you 
started dancing and I had,

7704
05:33:01,450 --> 05:33:02,283
so let me them on the line please.
The Blue Raspberry is when washing for 

7705
05:33:05,441 --> 05:33:06,274
four hours.
Ethan's left cheek is still undrawn 

7706
05:33:09,140 --> 05:33:11,020
upon.
That's prime.

7707
05:33:11,021 --> 05:33:16,021
Realize the stream.
Adobe premiere settings.

7708
05:33:17,320 --> 05:33:18,340
Oh wait,
was it this?

7709
05:33:18,970 --> 05:33:20,970
I'm tripping balls.
Wait,

7710
05:33:20,980 --> 05:33:22,320
was that a adobe premiere?
Danner.

7711
05:33:22,330 --> 05:33:24,940
My tripping.
You're tripping.

7712
05:33:26,930 --> 05:33:27,760
Yeah,
I've been,

7713
05:33:27,760 --> 05:33:30,850
I've been spending too much time on 
adobe premiere.

7714
05:33:31,060 --> 05:33:32,250
I thought it was like,
Hey,

7715
05:33:32,380 --> 05:33:33,910
I just want to let everyone know I'm 
cutting.

7716
05:33:33,911 --> 05:33:36,090

7717
05:33:37,640 --> 05:33:41,940
Oh guys,

7718
05:33:42,470 --> 05:33:44,000
We are 1000 away.

7719
05:33:45,320 --> 05:33:48,770
You want to know what this is from?
It's like my favorite video of the year.

7720
05:33:48,850 --> 05:33:49,683
What is that from?
It's a new meme that's just taking the 

7721
05:33:51,981 --> 05:33:52,814
world by storm.
I was wondering why someone chose to 

7722
05:33:54,291 --> 05:33:55,250
draw that on me.
Yeah.

7723
05:33:55,251 --> 05:33:56,084
Let me show you guys.

7724
05:33:57,010 --> 05:33:58,620
You just wash it.
Good.

7725
05:33:58,940 --> 05:34:00,060
Yeah.
I won't even say anything.

7726
05:34:00,061 --> 05:34:00,894
Just watch it

7727
05:34:01,130 --> 05:34:02,810

This takes place in a store.

7728
05:34:03,690 --> 05:34:08,240
Then I met.
Oh yeah.

7729
05:34:09,770 --> 05:34:14,770
Fuck that shit up.
No,

7730
05:34:18,040 --> 05:34:23,040

Right now I want to hit this guy for 
real.

7732
05:34:40,560 --> 05:34:43,800
You just roll this guy to convenience 
stores and just like he's still going?

7733
05:34:43,801 --> 05:34:44,634
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

7734
05:34:44,640 --> 05:34:47,400
He just started giving you put him in 
the bag.

7735
05:34:48,030 --> 05:34:48,863
Just most like the primary emotion you 
feel when you see this is all about a 

7736
05:34:53,341 --> 05:34:54,174
game.
I'm going to make way too early to talk 

7737
05:34:57,430 --> 05:35:01,200

but I'm telling you watch games is going

7738
05:35:01,201 --> 05:35:03,820
to come to the table with the game.
That is this.

7739

05:35:32,030 --> 05:35:34,680
That's your game.

7743
05:35:40,040 --> 05:35:42,370
Fill that bag up.
I was trying to rob at bag.

7744
05:35:45,180 --> 05:35:46,013
You can just pick him up,
pick him and thought he was saying 

7745
05:35:48,800 --> 05:35:51,610
something completely different right 
now.

7746
05:35:54,630 --> 05:35:55,760
All these coming,
come on.

7747
05:35:56,300 --> 05:35:58,520
Come on please.
Just trying to help this guy.

7748
05:35:59,240 --> 05:36:02,450
He just refuses to get help.
Oh my God.

7749
05:36:02,660 --> 05:36:04,370
Wow.
He's still going.

7750
05:36:09,260 --> 05:36:13,310
What's the aftermath of it all starts 
and ends.

7751
05:36:13,311 --> 05:36:18,311
They want video sitting here when you 
got it.

7752
05:36:37,530 --> 05:36:40,390
Everybody to attention the best takedown
ever.

7753
05:36:40,930 --> 05:36:41,763
I'm just struggling here with these.
I feel like you're going to cut your 

7754
05:36:43,661 --> 05:36:46,900
thumb off.
Don't cut yourself now justin,

7755
05:36:46,901 --> 05:36:48,620

Huh?

7756
05:36:50,170 --> 05:36:52,000
I'm calling.
I'm trying to get one on one with Dan.

7757
05:36:52,001 --> 05:36:53,010
I mean Dan for credit.
Yeah,

7758
05:36:53,350 --> 05:36:54,240
I'm working on it.

05:40:47,210 --> 05:40:49,340
Hi Lucas.
How are you brother?

7823
05:40:50,360 --> 05:40:52,030
I'm fine.
How are you?

7824
05:40:52,620 --> 05:40:55,900
Let me ask you how,
what's your a spread,

7825
05:40:55,940 --> 05:40:57,660
you know,
are you good with dreams?

7826
05:40:57,661 --> 05:40:59,970
Do you know how to analyze dreams?
I had a doozy.

7827
05:41:02,550 --> 05:41:04,830
Well,
where do I begin?

7828
05:41:06,010 --> 05:41:06,843
Oh,

7829
05:41:07,180 --> 05:41:10,330
just by telling me about the injury.
Okay.

7830
05:41:10,331 --> 05:41:12,410
And or asking whatever questions you 
have.

7831
05:41:13,220 --> 05:41:15,290
Okay.
Well I,

7832
05:41:15,291 --> 05:41:16,124
myself,
I'm about 65 and my pappy passed when I 

7833
05:41:19,911 --> 05:41:21,690
was still around,
uh,

7834
05:41:21,860 --> 05:41:25,130
12.
So it's been a long time since I've seen

7835
05:41:25,131 --> 05:41:25,964
my pappy,
but I'm what was visited in my dreams 

7836
05:41:29,211 --> 05:41:33,680
last night by my pappy and uh,
it's a strange one.

7837
05:41:33,681 --> 05:41:36,710
So bear with me.
It's a little embarrassing.

7838
05:41:36,770 --> 05:41:38,670
So I hope you forgive me.
Um,

7839
05:41:38,750 --> 05:41:39,583
okay.
Well my back while I was sleeping in my 

7840
05:41:42,171 --> 05:41:43,004
bed,
I was a little boy and my pappy come in 

7841
05:41:46,371 --> 05:41:47,204
my room.

7842
05:41:48,740 --> 05:41:49,150
Yeah.

7843
05:41:49,150 --> 05:41:52,000
And he lifted the blanket and say more.
He said,

7844
05:41:52,030 --> 05:41:53,830
Ma,
ma,

7845
05:41:54,490 --> 05:41:56,320
little johnny,
that's my name,

7846
05:41:56,321 --> 05:41:57,820
Jonathan.
He called me little johnny.

7847
05:41:57,821 --> 05:41:58,770
He says,
well,

7848
05:41:58,790 --> 05:41:59,623
a little Jonathan.
I had peed the bed and it was soaking 

7849
05:42:02,201 --> 05:42:05,980
wet all the way and the dream I was,
there was so much yarn.

7850
05:42:06,280 --> 05:42:09,280
It was like I didn't stop and the whole 
room was filling up with a yard.

7851
05:42:09,610 --> 05:42:12,130
And so he comes swimming in and he said,
boy,

7852
05:42:12,131 --> 05:42:13,990
a little Joanie,
let me,

7853
05:42:13,991 --> 05:42:17,020
uh,
let me turn the faucet off for you.

7854
05:42:17,470 --> 05:42:18,303
And this we want to get real 
embarrassing because he put his mouth 

7855
05:42:19,961 --> 05:42:20,830
on,
you know,

7856
05:42:21,510 --> 05:42:23,260
uh,
you know,

7857
05:42:23,261 --> 05:42:25,150
on my penis,
my little penis.

7858
05:42:25,450 --> 05:42:27,720
And he say,
let me turn the faucet off for you,

7859
05:42:27,730 --> 05:42:32,020
a little johnny and he suck and you suck
and all the gear and come out.

7860
05:42:32,080 --> 05:42:32,913
And he's turned it off,
like turned it off with his mouth and 

7861
05:42:35,830 --> 05:42:38,870
then the urine keep slowly drain it out 
of the room.

7862
05:42:39,760 --> 05:42:42,040
The urine.
Well,

7863
05:42:42,250 --> 05:42:44,890
I'm getting a little emotional and the 
urine clear out.

7864
05:42:44,891 --> 05:42:48,190
And when it was dry,
my pappy lay down next to me and the bed

7865
05:42:48,520 --> 05:42:51,430
and he gave me a tend to hug and he 
kissed me on the neck and he said,

7866
05:42:51,431 --> 05:42:55,660
little johnny,
I just want you to know that anytime you

7867
05:42:55,661 --> 05:42:58,270
need me to suck on your a little penis.

7868
05:43:01,730 --> 05:43:06,730
Well,
yeah.

7869
05:43:08,150 --> 05:43:09,860
Disappeared.
He was a ghost.

7870
05:43:10,790 --> 05:43:12,110
So what do you,
what do you think about it?

7871
05:43:14,010 --> 05:43:19,010
So let me ask you a question.
When you were 12 before he passed,

7872
05:43:21,300 --> 05:43:23,340
were you ever afraid of him?

7873
05:43:25,060 --> 05:43:27,370
Well,
yes,

7874
05:43:27,400 --> 05:43:31,600
because sometimes my pathway would come 
home and he would,

7875
05:43:31,601 --> 05:43:33,350
uh,
what,

7876
05:43:33,351 --> 05:43:36,670
what he was a nurse and he sometimes he 
would,

7877
05:43:36,880 --> 05:43:41,830
he would change colostomy bags or the 
old folks and he would come,

7878
05:43:41,831 --> 05:43:45,960
smelled of urine at home.
And I thought that was our thought.

7879
05:43:45,970 --> 05:43:48,610
That was a little strange.
And I do think,

7880
05:43:49,720 --> 05:43:50,390
well,
yes,

7881
05:43:50,390 --> 05:43:52,360
I was very terrified on my pappy.

7882
05:43:54,260 --> 05:43:56,270
Okay.
Second question.

7883
05:43:56,720 --> 05:43:59,180
Did you really peed the bed when you 
were young?

7884
05:44:00,510 --> 05:44:04,920
Oh yes.
I peed the bed a lot and fact I,

7885
05:44:05,380 --> 05:44:07,740
okay.
I'm ashamed to admit it once again cause

7886
05:44:07,741 --> 05:44:09,290
it's quite embarrassing.
But I,

7887
05:44:09,800 --> 05:44:12,810
well I sleep with rubber sheets because 
that had been,

7888
05:44:12,811 --> 05:44:14,440
I'm afraid has never,
uh Huh.

7889
05:44:17,250 --> 05:44:20,850
I'm afraid that habit is not a left me.

7890
05:44:25,590 --> 05:44:30,590
Beautiful thing about this can really be
your breakthrough of being able to leave

7891
05:44:35,161 --> 05:44:40,161
this pattern.
So the metaphysical reason for peeing in

7892
05:44:41,851 --> 05:44:45,570
the bed,
it's fear of a parent,

7893
05:44:46,170 --> 05:44:47,003
especially a male parent.
So it makes sense that a with the way 

7894
05:44:52,801 --> 05:44:57,030
you felt about him,
that you would do it and that b,

7895
05:44:57,660 --> 05:45:01,140
that your memory of him would involve 
that.

7896
05:45:02,040 --> 05:45:07,040
So the sucking away represents you suck 
in a way.

7897
05:45:09,331 --> 05:45:10,164
This kind of,
if I'm looking at my father who think 

7898
05:45:12,391 --> 05:45:16,680
about it in the dream,
he was so sensitive and he was so tender

7899
05:45:16,681 --> 05:45:18,660
and he was so loving,
so kind.

7900
05:45:19,380 --> 05:45:22,920
So when he was here,
you paid attention to the scary part.

7901
05:45:23,910 --> 05:45:28,910
Now years later you ready to move into 
this next part of your life.

7902
05:45:29,670 --> 05:45:32,220
So you made it to leave that pattern 
behind.

7903
05:45:32,460 --> 05:45:34,830
So you focused on the tinder,
they're loving,

7904
05:45:35,370 --> 05:45:37,470
tender and loving part was there when he
was alive.

7905
05:45:37,710 --> 05:45:40,410
That's true.
Not what you focused on as a kid.

7906
05:45:42,630 --> 05:45:43,463
Well that's true.
He wants Mary tend to with the whole 

7907
05:45:45,691 --> 05:45:47,010
what?
The penis and the mouth.

7908
05:45:47,011 --> 05:45:47,844
But the problem I'm having now,
and I do think what you said was 

7909
05:45:51,480 --> 05:45:54,330
fascinating,
I'm really struck by it,

7910
05:45:54,780 --> 05:45:55,613
but the problem is I've gotten my wife 
and she has a thing she likes and I 

7911
05:45:59,701 --> 05:46:02,670
don't know how this all connect,
but she liked to poop in the bed.

7912
05:46:02,671 --> 05:46:06,300
I tell you and I'm,
I'm okay with it because,

7913
05:46:06,690 --> 05:46:09,390
well,
my father used to poop in the bed and he

7914
05:46:09,391 --> 05:46:10,224
thought it was a good time,
but my wife is into it now and I think 

7915
05:46:13,141 --> 05:46:16,020
it's a little uncomfortable too.
I like,

7916
05:46:16,230 --> 05:46:17,063
I loved the wife,
but I sometimes think there's a little 

7917
05:46:18,871 --> 05:46:20,220
too much poop in the bed.

7918
05:46:25,820 --> 05:46:28,250
Oh wait real quick.
I just want to say real quick,

7919
05:46:28,251 --> 05:46:29,960
hold on.
Before you start talking,

7920
05:46:30,260 --> 05:46:35,260
I just want to say also that I,
I in my dreams,

7921
05:46:35,301 --> 05:46:36,134
I would poop in the bed too.
And I used to poop and spray poop all 

7922
05:46:40,521 --> 05:46:42,410
over the room.
And lately,

7923
05:46:42,411 --> 05:46:45,230
and this is why I'm calling the last few
days,

7924
05:46:45,231 --> 05:46:50,231
I'm just been Skorton ropes a poop out 
of my butt all into my bed and I,

7925
05:46:51,890 --> 05:46:54,020
and that's why I'm calling,
I'm trying to figure out,

7926
05:46:54,021 --> 05:46:59,021
is this some sort of source that this is
coming from where I'm just Skorton these

7927
05:46:59,631 --> 05:47:00,470
ropes.

7928
05:47:04,420 --> 05:47:09,420
So what you're saying is that in your 
quest to move away from urinating in the

7929
05:47:11,551 --> 05:47:12,384
bed,
you think it may disrupt what your wife 

7930
05:47:15,001 --> 05:47:15,900
likes.
So tell me.

7931
05:47:15,901 --> 05:47:16,734
Okay.

7932
05:47:18,130 --> 05:47:22,060
I'm worried about that.
It might have something to do with this.

7933
05:47:22,180 --> 05:47:23,013
In my quest is get away from urinating 
in the bed that it's now been the door 

7934
05:47:26,980 --> 05:47:31,980
to Skorton brown ropes in the bed.
Just huge turd snake.

7935
05:47:36,630 --> 05:47:37,463
Yeah.

7936
05:47:38,760 --> 05:47:42,540
So what is it that your wife likes?
What form that she preferred?

7937
05:47:43,120 --> 05:47:43,953
Well,
my wife likes it when the poops in the 

7938
05:47:45,941 --> 05:47:49,300
bed and I think it's fine,
you know,

7939
05:47:49,450 --> 05:47:53,410
every once in a while.
But she asks me every evening,

7940
05:47:53,411 --> 05:47:55,540
I tried to go to the bathroom.
I liked to,

7941
05:47:55,660 --> 05:47:56,340
you know,
uh,

7942
05:47:56,340 --> 05:47:59,470
let it out before the bedtime.
But she says,

7943
05:47:59,471 --> 05:48:01,120
no.
She says,

7944
05:48:01,121 --> 05:48:01,901
no,
Johnny,

7945
05:48:01,901 --> 05:48:04,000
I want you to poop right here in the 
bed.

7946
05:48:04,330 --> 05:48:05,163
And she likes to cuddle because we lost 
a child and she likes to pretend that 

7947
05:48:08,441 --> 05:48:09,640
the poop is the child.

7948
05:48:11,080 --> 05:48:11,913
So if she cuts,

7949
05:48:15,540 --> 05:48:18,280
does it matter to her?
Which one of yours,

7950
05:48:18,820 --> 05:48:22,000
whether it's hers or yours,
in terms of pretending is the child?

7951
05:48:22,150 --> 05:48:23,150
Well,
I,

7952
05:48:23,230 --> 05:48:25,930
you know,
it's just the most important thing,

7953
05:48:26,080 --> 05:48:26,913
not so much about the child,
it's just that having shooting these 

7954
05:48:31,121 --> 05:48:33,730
ropes,
a snake like poop in the bed,

7955
05:48:33,731 --> 05:48:36,910
just splattering them all in around the 
bed and,

7956
05:48:38,080 --> 05:48:43,080
and pn in the bed and just,
it's a wild situation.

7957
05:48:46,400 --> 05:48:47,233
Okay.

7958
05:48:47,790 --> 05:48:48,500
Is,

7959
05:48:48,500 --> 05:48:49,890
and I mean,
I feel that,

7960
05:48:50,600 --> 05:48:51,510
oh,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

7961
05:48:51,511 --> 05:48:55,980
but I feel like that's the most 
important part of the conversation.

7962
05:48:57,580 --> 05:48:58,413
Okay.

7963
05:48:58,470 --> 05:49:00,210
You know,
I keep bringing up my wife,

7964
05:49:00,510 --> 05:49:03,360
I keep bringing up my wife and all this 
other stuff,

7965
05:49:03,361 --> 05:49:06,870
but really it's about me just Skorton 
these brown rope,

7966
05:49:06,871 --> 05:49:10,390
snake ropes,
just shooting these snake ropes out

7967
05:49:11,890 --> 05:49:12,723
it.

7968
05:49:17,200 --> 05:49:19,860
I totally get it.
And I do think that's important,

7969
05:49:20,250 --> 05:49:22,230
but we have to relate it back to the 
dream.

7970
05:49:22,860 --> 05:49:25,140
The dream is,
was this conversation.

7971
05:49:25,710 --> 05:49:26,543
So I think that there's some 
significance to the fact that you're 

7972
05:49:30,211 --> 05:49:35,211
paying on a bed of fear of a parent who 
is the male period.

7973
05:49:36,510 --> 05:49:38,910
So when you started telling me about 
your wife,

7974
05:49:39,450 --> 05:49:40,283
it made me think about the actual 
activity that your father did in the 

7975
05:49:44,440 --> 05:49:45,273
drink

7976
05:49:47,530 --> 05:49:49,000
real quick.
One last thing is,

7977
05:49:49,040 --> 05:49:51,910
I don't,
when I say my wife,

7978
05:49:51,970 --> 05:49:52,803
I should make it clear that,
I mean my pillow because I don't 

7979
05:49:56,651 --> 05:49:59,110
actually have a wife.
I have a pillow,

7980
05:50:02,040 --> 05:50:03,600
but I,
but to me that is,

7981
05:50:03,670 --> 05:50:07,380
but to me that is,
is my wife and,

7982
05:50:07,381 --> 05:50:08,630
and,
and,

7983
05:50:09,420 --> 05:50:09,910
and,
and,

7984
05:50:09,910 --> 05:50:10,421
and,
and,

7985
05:50:10,421 --> 05:50:11,320
and,
and,

7986
05:50:11,321 --> 05:50:13,510
and I'm,
well it's,

7987
05:50:13,511 --> 05:50:16,750
it's a little ball of cotton inside of 
the pillow is,

7988
05:50:17,350 --> 05:50:18,040
but,
but,

7989
05:50:18,040 --> 05:50:21,700
but to me,
but to me it's a real baby.

7990
05:50:21,701 --> 05:50:25,630
And I want to just say that when I'm 
Skorton these snake,

7991
05:50:25,631 --> 05:50:27,700
like,
like four feet.

7992
05:50:28,170 --> 05:50:29,003
Yeah.

7993
05:50:36,730 --> 05:50:37,563
Johnny.

7994
05:50:38,450 --> 05:50:39,230
Yeah.

7995
05:50:39,230 --> 05:50:39,941
I'm sorry.
When,

7996
05:50:39,941 --> 05:50:44,941
I'm sorry.
When I'm scoring these four feet snake,

7997
05:50:47,301 --> 05:50:51,680
like ropes of Poop,
snake ropes in my bed,

7998
05:50:52,460 --> 05:50:57,460
I'm starting to put that onto my pillow 
wife and I'm starting to project the,

7999
05:50:59,060 --> 05:51:03,650
she's doing that.
But it's really me and I'm by myself and

8000
05:51:03,651 --> 05:51:06,070
I'm by myself and,
and I,

8001
05:51:06,080 --> 05:51:07,890
and I'm a bit,
I'm a bit ashamed to,

8002
05:51:08,150 --> 05:51:08,983
to,
to come out just right out of the gate 

8003
05:51:10,611 --> 05:51:12,310
and admit that.
So that's,

8004
05:51:12,320 --> 05:51:13,220
that's my problem.

8005
05:51:13,550 --> 05:51:15,320
That's okay.
I want to just be yourself.

8006
05:51:16,130 --> 05:51:16,963
So can we please go back to the dream?
Tell me the part again about what your 

8007
05:51:20,631 --> 05:51:22,760
dad was doing to get rid of the urine.

8008
05:51:23,250 --> 05:51:25,770
So my daddy,
what had my little,

8009
05:51:26,460 --> 05:51:31,460
my little baby penis in his mouth and he
kept on suck in and buttons it.

8010
05:51:36,660 --> 05:51:37,493
Yeah.

8011
05:51:38,230 --> 05:51:40,360
Yeah.
I think there's some significance there.

8012
05:51:40,361 --> 05:51:44,980
I think that that's the key.
The key is that your father,

8013
05:51:45,420 --> 05:51:47,080
well,
just to,

8014
05:51:47,700 --> 05:51:50,230
just to make it clear,
just not to interrupt,

8015
05:51:50,231 --> 05:51:51,064
but I just want to let you know that one
important part of my dream is that my 

8016
05:51:56,351 --> 05:51:57,184
dad,
he was actually in my dream was a 

8017
05:51:59,710 --> 05:52:00,543
pillow.

8018
05:52:02,130 --> 05:52:02,520
Okay,

8019
05:52:02,520 --> 05:52:05,310
so it wasn't your real no,
no,

8020
05:52:05,311 --> 05:52:07,050
no.
In the junior real path know,

8021
05:52:07,051 --> 05:52:08,160
in,
in the dream.

8022
05:52:08,161 --> 05:52:10,080
My,
pappy was a beautiful,

8023
05:52:11,100 --> 05:52:15,370
like a long pillow,
like one of those leg pit,

8024
05:52:15,390 --> 05:52:18,840
like the kind of pillows you put it 
between your legs and cuddle with.

8025
05:52:19,710 --> 05:52:21,270
And in my dream and,
and,

8026
05:52:21,300 --> 05:52:23,160
and,
and when I say suck,

8027
05:52:23,190 --> 05:52:28,190
I think more accurately would be brushed
up against because he was a pillow and,

8028
05:52:32,220 --> 05:52:33,053
and I,
I'm so confused and contort it about 

8029
05:52:36,151 --> 05:52:39,180
these things,
but I don't know,

8030
05:52:39,181 --> 05:52:41,940
I just think that it's more,
I'm just,

8031
05:52:41,941 --> 05:52:44,550
I'm,
I'm fighting against being truthful with

8032
05:52:44,551 --> 05:52:45,221
you and,
and,

8033
05:52:45,221 --> 05:52:46,350
and then,
you know,

8034
05:52:46,920 --> 05:52:48,210
the,
the fantasy that,

8035
05:52:48,211 --> 05:52:49,890
that the,
the lies,

8036
05:52:49,891 --> 05:52:52,050
you know,
the truthfulness and the lies.

8037
05:52:52,600 --> 05:52:55,390
So my question is,
who do I pee?

8038
05:52:55,391 --> 05:52:57,520
I should I pee or poop in the bed?

8039
05:52:58,370 --> 05:52:59,203
Okay.

8040
05:53:01,080 --> 05:53:04,400
Well,
I think that's a good question,

8041
05:53:04,401 --> 05:53:05,234
Johnny.
But I think a deeper way to look at it 

8042
05:53:07,010 --> 05:53:07,843
is,
what does it mean when you visualize 

8043
05:53:11,571 --> 05:53:12,404
your wife,
when you're awake and your father when 

8044
05:53:15,261 --> 05:53:16,094
you're asleep,

8045
05:53:16,100 --> 05:53:18,470
but they're both close.
Oh,

8046
05:53:19,260 --> 05:53:22,540
exactly.
That's the significance right there.

8047
05:53:23,280 --> 05:53:25,290
That's where you really have to look at 
and say,

8048
05:53:25,291 --> 05:53:27,160
what does that mean?
That,

8049
05:53:27,170 --> 05:53:28,570
um,
you had a real,

8050
05:53:28,710 --> 05:53:33,060
there's another piece of information.
It's the important thing.

8051
05:53:33,070 --> 05:53:38,070
You should know that I'm an heir to a 
large pillow company.

8052
05:53:39,560 --> 05:53:40,393
I can't say which,
because it's very private and I only 

8053
05:53:43,821 --> 05:53:48,821
grew up around pillows and I only have 
pillows around me and I refuse.

8054
05:53:50,450 --> 05:53:54,310
I'm very rich,
so I've sent away all human interaction,

8055
05:53:54,410 --> 05:53:56,480
only pillow interaction.
So,

8056
05:53:56,481 --> 05:54:01,100
and people that help me and work with me
or in giant pillow suits,

8057
05:54:01,580 --> 05:54:05,690
uh,
and that could be a part of it.

8058
05:54:05,691 --> 05:54:08,180
And I've been living that way for the 
last 17 years.

8059
05:54:09,500 --> 05:54:10,610
But,
uh,

8060
05:54:10,700 --> 05:54:11,533
I don't know.

8061
05:54:14,970 --> 05:54:15,601
No,
you're,

8062
05:54:15,601 --> 05:54:17,670
you're real.
Pappy died when you were 12,

8063
05:54:17,671 --> 05:54:18,960
is that correct?
That's right.

8064
05:54:20,860 --> 05:54:21,693
He really was.
He really did work at the hospital and 

8065
05:54:24,311 --> 05:54:26,560
deal with those [inaudible] bags.
Correct.

8066
05:54:26,760 --> 05:54:28,500
Oh,
well that's so that poppy.

8067
05:54:28,530 --> 05:54:31,020
So that was the poppy.
That was my pillow,

8068
05:54:31,050 --> 05:54:34,230
but my real poppy was the,
the owner.

8069
05:54:34,231 --> 05:54:38,520
He established a big below company.
I don't want to say which one it was.

8070
05:54:38,690 --> 05:54:39,361
Oh,
of course.

8071
05:54:39,361 --> 05:54:42,600
But uh,
the one that was changing colostomy bags

8072
05:54:42,601 --> 05:54:45,360
as a nurse.
Well that one was a,

8073
05:54:46,050 --> 05:54:47,250
that one was a pillow.

8074
05:54:48,780 --> 05:54:49,613
Okay.

8075
05:54:49,650 --> 05:54:50,790
Oh,
I see.

8076
05:54:51,360 --> 05:54:53,820
Now.
It all makes sense to me.

8077
05:54:53,930 --> 05:54:55,800
So what do you,
what?

8078
05:54:55,850 --> 05:54:57,580
What do you think I should do?
Like just,

8079
05:54:57,970 --> 05:55:01,390
I'm going to let you talk and sort of 
let me know what you think.

8080
05:55:02,790 --> 05:55:03,623
Yeah.

8081
05:55:04,430 --> 05:55:09,430
Well Johnny,
I think that both pee and poop represent

8082
05:55:10,730 --> 05:55:13,130
parts of your life that you want to 
release,

8083
05:55:13,670 --> 05:55:17,210
parts that you want to get rid of to 
excrete.

8084
05:55:17,980 --> 05:55:18,813
So the form does it really matter.
What matters is that you continue to 

8085
05:55:23,181 --> 05:55:28,181
have a method to be able to take all the
things that you deal with in life and be

8086
05:55:28,281 --> 05:55:33,281
able to release them.
So the question of which form of release

8087
05:55:34,040 --> 05:55:37,520
should I use is less important than it 
should.

8088
05:55:37,521 --> 05:55:38,354
I believe the answer is yes,
you have to release because it's really 

8089
05:55:43,281 --> 05:55:45,290
a symbol.
It's a symbol for the,

8090
05:55:45,300 --> 05:55:46,133
what has gotten you this far in life is 
your ability to be able to take in 

8091
05:55:49,371 --> 05:55:53,390
things and then be able to release them 
so you're not holding on to them.

8092
05:55:53,480 --> 05:55:56,040
That's the real significance here,
jen.

8093
05:55:57,050 --> 05:55:59,840
That's incredible that you were able to 
decipher that.

8094
05:55:59,841 --> 05:56:04,470
So I will tell my wife that you said I 
will keep shitting in the bed and that's

8095
05:56:04,471 --> 05:56:05,370
fine.
And that,

8096
05:56:05,371 --> 05:56:06,600
uh,
I'm sorry,

8097
05:56:06,601 --> 05:56:07,680
what was your name again?

8098
05:56:11,350 --> 05:56:12,820
Lucas.
Thank you so much.

8099
05:56:12,821 --> 05:56:13,654
I will keep shitting in the bed and uh,
I will tell my wife that Lucas was told 

8100
05:56:18,431 --> 05:56:21,760
me I need to release God Dab it.
Right.

8101
05:56:22,150 --> 05:56:25,960
And so I will keep shit and some comes 
up because black,

8102
05:56:26,500 --> 05:56:27,333
you got to shit the bed sometimes and if
that sometimes was every night and then 

8103
05:56:31,841 --> 05:56:34,570
by Golly,
I'll shit the bed every damn night.

8104
05:56:35,380 --> 05:56:40,380
Amen brother.
All right,

8105
05:56:41,320 --> 05:56:42,670
well Lucas,
I tell Ya,

8106
05:56:42,790 --> 05:56:43,623
I recommend it to you.
It's a very cut the dick situation to 

8107
05:56:47,561 --> 05:56:49,840
shit in your own bed and I recommend it 
to you.

8108
05:56:49,841 --> 05:56:51,100
Well you'll give it a shot for me.

8109
05:56:52,380 --> 05:56:53,213
Okay.

8110
05:56:53,430 --> 05:56:54,590
I'm open to everything.

8111
05:56:56,120 --> 05:56:57,390
I also just want to say that

8112
05:56:58,420 --> 05:56:59,253
I called in,
I paid for the Guinness World Book of 

8113
05:57:02,980 --> 05:57:03,813
Records People to come and uh,
I do squirt the longest brown snake 

8114
05:57:08,170 --> 05:57:09,003
ropes out of my butt in w in my bed and 
I think I might get a Guinness World 

8115
05:57:13,930 --> 05:57:16,480
record for that.
So I'm pretty excited about that.

8116
05:57:16,481 --> 05:57:20,320
So that's at least a bright,
that's one at least bright,

8117
05:57:20,350 --> 05:57:21,183
bright light in my life.
So I thought I'd let you know about 

8118
05:57:23,891 --> 05:57:24,724
them.

8119
05:57:25,530 --> 05:57:27,840
They really would.
Thank you for sharing that Johnny.

8120
05:57:28,170 --> 05:57:29,970
Well thank you.
Thank you for your call,

8121
05:57:29,971 --> 05:57:30,804
but thank you for listening.
I hope that you'll be pooping in your 

8122
05:57:32,731 --> 05:57:36,370
own bed cuddling.
Get Ben.

8123
05:57:36,690 --> 05:57:37,920
Appreciate Ya.
Right.

8124
05:57:38,040 --> 05:57:39,760
Take care now.
Bye Bye.

8125
05:57:42,170 --> 05:57:43,003
Bye Bye.

8126
05:57:44,950 --> 05:57:48,580
So I have a question real quick,
real quick.

8127
05:57:48,581 --> 05:57:50,290
God,
anybody here skate?

8128
05:57:51,310 --> 05:57:52,510
Whoa,
wait,

8129
05:57:52,511 --> 05:57:55,100
we got a lot to talk about.
What just happened?

8130
05:57:55,750 --> 05:57:56,321
Well,
I all,

8131
05:57:56,321 --> 05:58:00,640
I can tell you it's fucking ethan 
comedic sensibilities and I'm like stop.

8132
05:58:00,641 --> 05:58:03,430
Like I keep trying to reroute it like 
you're talking about like,

8133
05:58:03,460 --> 05:58:04,720
like child rape.
I'm like,

8134
05:58:04,721 --> 05:58:09,721
can we make this more about like it was 
a dream because the headline here is how

8135
05:58:12,101 --> 05:58:15,670
that guy commonly encouraged you to 
never stop shitting for the rest of your

8136
05:58:15,671 --> 05:58:16,504
life.
Pull you around like a localizer 

8137
05:58:19,580 --> 05:58:22,480
headline.
Fairly impressed.

8138
05:58:22,690 --> 05:58:23,523
I was really impressed.
Like the type of people we're going to 

8139
05:58:25,031 --> 05:58:25,864
be calling this person up or people who 
are at the end of their rope who have a 

8140
05:58:28,391 --> 05:58:32,590
lot of legitimate problems and you could
just like scam him and this guy's like,

8141
05:58:32,750 --> 05:58:34,210
at least this is a voice to talk to.

8142
05:58:34,210 --> 05:58:35,620
He's like kind.
He's gentle.

8143
05:58:35,800 --> 05:58:39,930
I'm pretty impressed with psychics.
Yeah,

8144
05:58:39,931 --> 05:58:41,190
two for two.
For two.

8145
05:58:41,440 --> 05:58:43,030
The first one didn't want to take your 
money.

8146
05:58:43,031 --> 05:58:45,520
Second one was just like,
you couldn't face him.

8147
05:58:45,550 --> 05:58:47,890
By the way,
that was my real problem in life.

8148
05:58:47,920 --> 05:58:48,753
That guy helped me like that was,
I think he's like a good therapist and 

8149
05:58:51,400 --> 05:58:54,670
calling themselves shitting the bed for 
17 years.

8150
05:58:54,790 --> 05:58:56,260
You know,
now's not the time to stop.

8151
05:58:56,500 --> 05:58:57,970
Keep shitting that bed.
Little Johnny.

8152
05:58:58,000 --> 05:58:58,990
He's just like,
keep going.

8153
05:58:59,260 --> 05:59:01,420
Just don't feel bad about it guys.
I mean,

8154
05:59:01,480 --> 05:59:03,430
I got to say,
first of all,

8155
05:59:03,431 --> 05:59:06,370
I do want to say that we did hit 75,000
words back,

8156
05:59:06,400 --> 05:59:08,280
read 76,000
all we did it.

8157
05:59:08,490 --> 05:59:09,323
We did it,
guys

8158
05:59:12,420 --> 05:59:17,130
do.
Well,

8159
05:59:17,131 --> 05:59:19,860
let's do the pepper and then we'll do 
our thing.

8160
05:59:19,890 --> 05:59:20,723
Yeah,
perfect.

8161
05:59:21,680 --> 05:59:22,620
That best way to do it.

8162
05:59:23,080 --> 05:59:23,590
Okay,
sure.

8163
05:59:23,590 --> 05:59:25,650
As you guys are doing the call,
I already ate the peppers.

8164
05:59:25,660 --> 05:59:28,930
So yeah,
those donation money's coming.

8165
05:59:29,560 --> 05:59:33,130
They're going for a good cause guys.
It was a dream.

8166
05:59:33,140 --> 05:59:35,860
My Dad didn't,
he peed in the kid beat.

8167
05:59:35,980 --> 05:59:38,230
He stuck the pee out of the room through
his penis.

8168
05:59:38,860 --> 05:59:39,693
Was that an autumn reasonable day?
I was trying to steer it back onto a 

8169
05:59:43,240 --> 05:59:44,740
well,
I appreciate the poop snake.

8170
05:59:46,010 --> 05:59:48,790
I was just trying to make it just trying
to,

8171
05:59:49,250 --> 05:59:50,083
I just wanted to get it back into where 
we're all laughing really hard and not 

8172
05:59:52,211 --> 05:59:53,080
going,
Oh God,

8173
05:59:53,081 --> 05:59:56,110
this is maybe a little too real for some
people.

8174
05:59:57,970 --> 05:59:58,803
Wait,
where the fuck?

8175
05:59:58,860 --> 05:59:59,860
Yeah.
Well,

8176
05:59:59,890 --> 06:00:00,723
you know,
I was just a feeling you're just having 

8177
06:00:02,381 --> 06:00:03,730
fun.
We're all having fun.

8178
06:00:04,210 --> 06:00:06,610
I want to make you feel bad.
Um,

8179
06:00:07,390 --> 06:00:08,890
do we?
Wow.

8180
06:00:09,400 --> 06:00:11,020
Wow.
The question is,

8181
06:00:11,880 --> 06:00:13,970
and we don't even know what this third 
song is.

8182
06:00:13,990 --> 06:00:14,823
I know what the fourth song did he know 
that there was two of us when we were 

8183
06:00:17,561 --> 06:00:19,870
goofing around cause he was taking it 
very serious.

8184
06:00:19,871 --> 06:00:20,704
I don't think he did because I was 
copying your pitch was like raising and 

8185
06:00:26,980 --> 06:00:29,430
[inaudible].

8186
06:00:29,630 --> 06:00:30,463
My name is miss social experiments where
like a white guy will be there and then 

8187
06:00:35,891 --> 06:00:36,724
they'll turn around and then like a 
black guy stands up and they act like 

8188
06:00:38,830 --> 06:00:40,200
nothing happened.
No.

8189
06:00:41,140 --> 06:00:41,973
Yeah.
Are only paying attention with like 30% 

8190
06:00:43,781 --> 06:00:44,614
of their brain.
And they tend to like that video where 

8191
06:00:46,691 --> 06:00:48,730
there's like a,
there's like a guy in a gorilla suit.

8192
06:00:48,900 --> 06:00:49,920
Yeah,
yeah.

8193
06:00:49,930 --> 06:00:50,763
Ask a ball field and you're like,
did you see most people just tend to 

8194
06:00:52,931 --> 06:00:54,880
kind of assumed you it again and you're 
like,

8195
06:00:54,881 --> 06:00:57,160
oh,
these 6,000

8196
06:00:57,860 --> 06:01:01,060
I wonder what the CEO of direct really 
thought of that call.

8197
06:01:01,110 --> 06:01:03,980
Oh,
so sorry to the CEO of [inaudible].

8198
06:01:04,210 --> 06:01:05,290
I was making,
sorry.

8199
06:01:05,310 --> 06:01:06,143
No,
all about poop and stuff and you are 

8200
06:01:07,481 --> 06:01:08,314
making it about your bottle or whatever.
He was sucking urine out of my penis to 

8201
06:01:12,401 --> 06:01:17,030
help bring the room guy.
The important thing is $76,000

8202
06:01:19,810 --> 06:01:22,300
and $76,000
for charity.

8203
06:01:22,880 --> 06:01:24,970
Patrice Wilson.
I'm still watching.

8204
06:01:25,930 --> 06:01:27,100
Oh,
that's gotta be a gag.

8205
06:01:27,160 --> 06:01:31,480

8207
06:01:34,820 --> 06:01:37,150
We did it.
We are fucking killing it.

8208
06:01:37,390 --> 06:01:40,300
We've got 70,002

8209
06:01:40,510 --> 06:01:42,220
Take you to every single person has done

8210
06:01:42,230 --> 06:01:44,400
We're going to throw it to Aussie to 
play it.

8211
06:01:44,470 --> 06:01:45,303
The next requested song,
we're going to go back into the lobby 

8212
06:01:47,680 --> 06:01:50,350
for joey to eat a pepper.
I'm super excited.

8213
06:01:51,260 --> 06:01:53,790
This,
this night is just beginning.

8214
06:01:56,490 --> 06:01:57,560
We're going to keep going.

8215
06:01:58,280 --> 06:02:00,590
I think we could do it.
Let's do it.

8216
06:02:00,591 --> 06:02:01,424
I'm down.
I mean it's going to be a 10 hour 

8217
06:02:02,271 --> 06:02:03,680
stream,
but oh no,

8218
06:02:03,681 --> 06:02:04,311
I don't.
By the way,

8219
06:02:04,311 --> 06:02:06,420
if we open it up and doesn't look happy 
about that,

8220
06:02:06,500 --> 06:02:08,160
we,
if we opened up aussies,

8221
06:02:08,830 --> 06:02:10,520
we,
there'd be like a ton more.

8222
06:02:10,521 --> 06:02:13,340
Like,
all right,

8223
06:02:13,341 --> 06:02:14,330
here we go.
Throw it to her.

8224
06:02:14,380 --> 06:02:15,230
Hey wait,
wait.

8225
06:02:15,231 --> 06:02:17,660
How does this sound though?
Like in the,

8226
06:02:17,661 --> 06:02:18,494
in the old setup switching.
So we're going to switch over to music 

8227
06:02:21,681 --> 06:02:22,130
mode now,
so,

8228
06:02:22,130 --> 06:02:22,581
okay.
Okay.

8229
06:02:22,581 --> 06:02:25,270
So don't start.
Don't start until they go ahead and up.

8230
06:02:25,760 --> 06:02:26,900
Keep doing that so they can hear

8231
06:02:28,710 --> 06:02:30,070
good check,
check

8232
06:03:06,320 --> 06:03:11,320
to see the words.

8233
06:03:41,490 --> 06:03:46,490
Well,
welcome.

8234
06:03:58,430 --> 06:04:03,430
Yes.
Pay.

8235
06:04:53,580 --> 06:04:58,580
You said well,
yes,

8236
06:05:19,980 --> 06:05:20,813
yes.

8237
06:05:23,650 --> 06:05:24,483
Yeah.

8238
06:05:29,210 --> 06:05:31,480
Wow.
Wow.

8239
06:05:32,810 --> 06:05:33,581
Nope.
No,

8240
06:05:33,581 --> 06:05:34,950
dude,
this is incredible.

8241
06:05:36,700 --> 06:05:40,150
You've never heard the song before you 
went out of the room and by the way,

8242
06:05:40,180 --> 06:05:45,180
you were ready a long time ago,
so no Aussie fucking nailed it.

8243
06:05:46,030 --> 06:05:47,050
Chaos.
Chaos.

8244
06:05:48,100 --> 06:05:49,810
If you want more.
So that was a,

8245
06:05:49,811 --> 06:05:50,644
that was a year zero by ghost.
And that was donation was from a tech 

8246
06:05:53,861 --> 06:05:56,860
data tech data.
Tag it up.

8247
06:05:56,861 --> 06:05:58,540
Dan,
do we have any other more writing or are

8248
06:05:58,541 --> 06:05:59,920
we good to go to the pepper?
No,

8249
06:05:59,921 --> 06:06:00,880
no.
We got to go to the pepper.

8250
06:06:01,000 --> 06:06:02,370
We are so ready for the pepper,
but,

8251
06:06:02,371 --> 06:06:04,900
but I just want to say that aussies 
still has one more song.

8252
06:06:05,620 --> 06:06:06,620
Ready?
No,

8253
06:06:06,630 --> 06:06:08,350
you got it.
I paid for that one.

8254
06:06:08,351 --> 06:06:10,450
It's a minor one.
Did you grab that one?

8255
06:06:11,070 --> 06:06:11,980
Okay.
Bull Shit.

8256
06:06:12,190 --> 06:06:13,800
You're doing it.
Yeah,

8257
06:06:13,810 --> 06:06:14,643
yeah,
yeah.

8258
06:06:14,790 --> 06:06:15,623
Also Dan,
should we open it up for more Aussie 

8259
06:06:17,621 --> 06:06:18,454
songs?

8260
06:06:18,970 --> 06:06:21,520
I mean that's,
that's up to you guys ultimately.

8261
06:06:21,570 --> 06:06:22,870
Um,
a,

8262
06:06:22,871 --> 06:06:23,681
by the way,
Justin,

8263
06:06:23,681 --> 06:06:25,150
even,
what do you think a lot of the donations

8264
06:06:25,151 --> 06:06:26,920
are saying that you're setting up the 
skateboard wrong?

8265
06:06:27,040 --> 06:06:28,350
I don't know if that's accurate.
Not really.

8266
06:06:28,610 --> 06:06:29,830
Yeah,
but they saw you doing it.

8267
06:06:29,860 --> 06:06:31,570
I know there's been multiple people 
saying that.

8268
06:06:31,571 --> 06:06:34,180
So am I fucking it up?
I don't know.

8269
06:06:35,410 --> 06:06:36,580
Let's go.
You're probably right.

8270
06:06:36,940 --> 06:06:38,380
I'm a little guy.
It's pepper time.

8271
06:06:39,310 --> 06:06:40,270
No,
I'm not sure at all.

8272
06:06:40,271 --> 06:06:42,210
I'm just saying what the donation 
stream.

8273
06:06:42,700 --> 06:06:47,700
I think it's good and can get somebody 
just like donate $10 any $10 donations.

8274
06:06:47,981 --> 06:06:50,230
I'll read your comments and like,
tell me,

8275
06:06:50,231 --> 06:06:52,000
am I doing it wrong or what?

8276
06:06:54,550 --> 06:06:56,860
I feel like the trucks might be wrong.
I'm not going to lie.

8277
06:06:58,000 --> 06:07:00,580
I think that's what people are,
but I feel like I got the trucks right.

8278
06:07:00,581 --> 06:07:03,220
Like our,
aren't the bushings going in or do the,

8279
06:07:03,280 --> 06:07:07,030
are the bushing is going out,
but waiting for Groin for advice guys,

8280
06:07:08,690 --> 06:07:10,900
am I the only way they can communicate 
with those?

8281
06:07:10,901 --> 06:07:12,850
Like,
I know,

8282
06:07:12,880 --> 06:07:14,530
like,
I fucking know this and I'm like,

8283
06:07:14,620 --> 06:07:16,090
just being retarded,
I think.

8284
06:07:16,091 --> 06:07:16,751
I think,
I think,

8285
06:07:16,751 --> 06:07:18,220
you know what?
I think they're right.

8286
06:07:18,280 --> 06:07:21,640
I think would go out.
Oh No.

8287
06:07:21,700 --> 06:07:25,150
What have I done?
Well,

8288
06:07:25,510 --> 06:07:27,370
that's just on me.
I got a fucking,

8289
06:07:27,371 --> 06:07:30,460
uh,
just re-installed the bush,

8290
06:07:30,520 --> 06:07:32,650
but I feel like,
I feel like that's the way it goes.

8291
06:07:32,651 --> 06:07:34,270
Right.
You're asking the wrong dude,

8292
06:07:34,271 --> 06:07:35,104
man.
I got on a skateboard for two seconds 

8293
06:07:37,541 --> 06:07:38,680
and Mike,
can we get a,

8294
06:07:38,681 --> 06:07:40,900
can we get like Tony Hawk or somebody on
the line?

8295
06:07:40,901 --> 06:07:42,490
Do you think about it?
I was trying to drop Peter Griffin.

8296
06:07:42,550 --> 06:07:43,450
What do you think?
It's more,

8297
06:07:43,460 --> 06:07:44,293
it's more good,
right?

8298
06:07:44,300 --> 06:07:45,160
Keep going.
Yeah.

8299
06:07:45,260 --> 06:07:47,390
That little spot.
Like make that be more,

8300
06:07:47,500 --> 06:07:48,580
more Simpson.
Okay,

8301
06:07:48,940 --> 06:07:50,130
got it.
That's,

8302
06:07:50,131 --> 06:07:51,520
that's a,
that's a fucking bat.

8303
06:07:51,521 --> 06:07:54,670
That will go for some money.
Um,

8304
06:07:54,790 --> 06:07:58,780
is there anybody out there they could 
confirm or deny?

8305
06:07:59,740 --> 06:08:02,090
I should have brought my own square when
we were switching over down here.

8306
06:08:02,100 --> 06:08:04,780
Here we go.
All right.

8307
06:08:05,560 --> 06:08:09,820
Hey everybody and welcome to the second 
annual h three podcasts,

8308
06:08:09,821 --> 06:08:12,280
charity bonanza,
and give it up.

8309
06:08:12,281 --> 06:08:13,114
Everybody.
Thank you to everyone who participated 

8310
06:08:15,311 --> 06:08:16,630
so far,
so glad to have you.

8311
06:08:16,840 --> 06:08:17,740
Now,
as you know,

8312
06:08:17,741 --> 06:08:21,250
we've hit our third milestone here today
with me.

8313
06:08:21,251 --> 06:08:24,130
I have the notorious,
didn't ghost pepper.

8314
06:08:24,131 --> 06:08:24,821
Yes,
that's right.

8315
06:08:24,821 --> 06:08:27,040
It was one of the spiciest peppers in 
the world.

8316
06:08:27,170 --> 06:08:30,670
Attila was dethroned recently by the 
Carolina reaper.

8317
06:08:30,850 --> 06:08:31,631
Yes.
Well,

8318
06:08:31,631 --> 06:08:32,464
Joey Salads.
We have here dressed as a crackhead 

8319
06:08:35,640 --> 06:08:39,910
Santa with his life fest and rotting 
milk that has been there for about eight

8320
06:08:39,911 --> 06:08:40,750
hours.
Joey,

8321
06:08:40,751 --> 06:08:44,530
how are you feeling today?
I feel like 75 grand.

8322
06:08:45,130 --> 06:08:46,960
75 grand.
That's right.

8323
06:08:46,961 --> 06:08:49,090
We got a superstar here with a great 
attitude.

8324
06:08:49,300 --> 06:08:50,133
Now tell me,
Joe,

8325
06:08:50,200 --> 06:08:51,033
what's the temperature of the milk?
Is that Luke warms at room temp on your 

8326
06:08:53,921 --> 06:08:54,790
feet?
Tell me about it.

8327
06:08:55,130 --> 06:08:56,710
Finally,
lesson room temperature.

8328
06:08:57,060 --> 06:09:00,610
Slightly less than room temperature.
It's how he,

8329
06:09:01,660 --> 06:09:04,060
yes,
we've got Kurds forming on the bottom of

8330
06:09:04,061 --> 06:09:05,740
the pool.
That's how cheeses made Joey.

8331
06:09:06,430 --> 06:09:08,080
Well,
we didn't actually quite,

8332
06:09:08,081 --> 06:09:09,340
I don't believe we,
uh,

8333
06:09:09,850 --> 06:09:13,630
con enough donations for that,
but thank you for bringing that up now.

8334
06:09:13,631 --> 06:09:14,464
Joey,
are we going to be able to be donating 

8335
06:09:17,771 --> 06:09:18,790
your underwear today?

8336
06:09:21,630 --> 06:09:23,200
Um,
Daniel,

8337
06:09:24,970 --> 06:09:26,620
we're going to have to get it nice and 
soggy.

8338
06:09:26,950 --> 06:09:27,783
Well,
a Napo enough to do enough to do about 

8339
06:09:29,411 --> 06:09:31,360
that.
Let's get started.

8340
06:09:31,690 --> 06:09:33,880
Joey,
do the honors please.

8341
06:09:33,881 --> 06:09:36,040
You can remove the stem here.
I'll hold the stem.

8342
06:09:36,520 --> 06:09:37,353
Okay.
And now you have to consume the whole 

8343
06:09:38,531 --> 06:09:43,531
thing as you know that as the rules.
And that is $75,000

8344
06:09:43,691 --> 06:09:46,360
raise for direct relief.
Thank you all so much.

8345
06:09:46,390 --> 06:09:47,320
Ian,
how are you feeling?

8346
06:09:48,100 --> 06:09:51,070
I'm excited for this and wait and we've 
all been waiting patiently.

8347
06:09:51,310 --> 06:09:54,820
It's been a long day and everyone has 
patiently awaited this big,

8348
06:09:54,821 --> 06:09:55,870
big,
big moment.

8349
06:09:55,871 --> 06:09:56,704
And we've all,
we're so happy that we made it here to 

8350
06:09:58,061 --> 06:09:59,560
75,000.
So Joey,

8351
06:10:00,040 --> 06:10:01,120
what,
what's going on here?

8352
06:10:01,121 --> 06:10:04,600
What are we doing?
Well I probably not.

8353
06:10:04,630 --> 06:10:06,850
That's probably the least of your 
worries there joey.

8354
06:10:09,890 --> 06:10:11,670
All right to pop that little baby boy.

8355
06:10:12,010 --> 06:10:15,100
Well pop that little mcnugget in your

Savoring the Melanin.

8373
06:10:58,610 --> 06:11:01,280
He is chewing it.
He is coughing.

8374
06:11:01,540 --> 06:11:04,730
He is going already for the water.
Oh No.

8375
06:11:05,120 --> 06:11:05,990
Oh No,

8376
06:11:06,350 --> 06:11:07,183
Oh No,

8377
06:11:08,290 --> 06:11:09,123
no.

8378
06:11:11,100 --> 06:11:13,100
It makes it worse.
It's like stuck in my teeth.

8379
06:11:13,580 --> 06:11:14,690
So it's like,
Eh,

Jewelry making up for all the,

8384
06:11:32,520 --> 06:11:37,520
All right.
What are you feeling right now?

8385
06:11:42,870 --> 06:11:43,800
Oh,
he's shaking.

8386
06:11:43,801 --> 06:11:46,530
He's trying to drink milk.
His hand is shaking.

8387
06:11:46,950 --> 06:11:49,470
Zack is going absolutely.
Tell me,

8388
06:11:49,471 --> 06:11:50,670

What is that Joe?

8389
06:11:53,030 --> 06:11:53,311
No,

8390
06:11:53,311 --> 06:11:53,941

Just smell.

8391
06:11:53,941 --> 06:11:55,110
Just smell.
Just smell.

8392
06:11:55,380 --> 06:11:56,220
Joey,
tell me what you,

8393
06:11:56,221 --> 06:11:57,054
what do you think of right now?
I'm thinking he's having trouble 

8394
06:12:00,511 --> 06:12:02,460
speaking was,
I'm assuming it's very spicy.

8395
06:12:02,461 --> 06:12:03,294
He's gargling milk,
said all the way in the back of the 

8396
06:12:07,411 --> 06:12:08,340
throat.
It's stuck there.

8397
06:12:08,520 --> 06:12:11,370
I'm trying not to laugh because this is 
quite a site.

8398
06:12:11,550 --> 06:12:12,830
Get a shot of Justin.
He's high.

8399
06:12:12,831 --> 06:12:13,980
He's a concerned,

8400
06:12:16,290 --> 06:12:18,720
oh,
he's going for the coke zero joey.

8401
06:12:19,000 --> 06:12:19,833
I hear,
I hear,

8402
06:12:19,890 --> 06:12:24,000
I hear coke zero has a really good 
calming effect for hot peppers.

8403
06:12:24,420 --> 06:12:25,230
Uh,
that's,

8404
06:12:25,230 --> 06:12:26,063
that's a shout out to you.
Coke zero and also McDonald's mcnuggets 

8405
06:12:29,400 --> 06:12:31,770
are delicious and good.

8406
06:12:32,100 --> 06:12:32,933
Joey is the heat.

8407
06:12:36,160 --> 06:12:38,850
It's still getting worse than worse.
Oh No,

8408
06:12:40,230 --> 06:12:42,040
it's starting to hit the stomach now.
So you guys,

8409
06:12:42,041 --> 06:12:46,330
this is why we got to get to $100,000
tonight.

8410
06:12:46,410 --> 06:12:48,370
We got to do it.
I mean,

8411
06:12:48,371 --> 06:12:52,030
not because we want to torture joey,
but also because you know,

8412
06:12:52,031 --> 06:12:55,300
look at how fun this is for us as we 
watch this poor guy.

8413
06:12:55,650 --> 06:12:58,470
Now Joey,
just remember as you are suffering,

8414
06:12:58,471 --> 06:13:03,471
they're in a pool of a spoiled milk that
we did raise $75,000

8415
06:13:04,081 --> 06:13:04,914
and remember,
at least she didn't get pepper spray in 

8416
06:13:06,301 --> 06:13:07,350
the fucking face.

8417
06:13:08,460 --> 06:13:09,390
Joey,
what's worse?

8418
06:13:09,391 --> 06:13:11,850
Pepper spray or this?
Probably the beverage spray,

8419
06:13:11,851 --> 06:13:13,560
but then pepper spray,
I was like blacked out for us.

8420
06:13:13,770 --> 06:13:14,371
Yeah.
No,

8421
06:13:14,371 --> 06:13:17,520
he don't eat a pepper spray was worse.
Pepper spray was worse.

8422
06:13:17,770 --> 06:13:18,160
Nope.

8423
06:13:18,160 --> 06:13:19,540
No.
Do you need water or anything?

8424
06:13:19,541 --> 06:13:20,980
Are you okay?
You will need some.

8425
06:13:21,040 --> 06:13:24,070
What do you need?
Do you need anything from us?

8426
06:13:24,570 --> 06:13:26,410
I'm actually feeling dizzy.
Oh No.

8427
06:13:26,720 --> 06:13:31,720
We'll stop drinking that milk.
Do you need to sit down?

8428
06:13:35,250 --> 06:13:39,700
Lay down.
Are you okay?

8429
06:13:39,810 --> 06:13:40,643
You all right?

8430
06:13:40,870 --> 06:13:41,631
You're doing it right.
You,

8431
06:13:41,631 --> 06:13:44,710
you can garner the milk and spit it out.
If I pass out,

8432
06:13:44,711 --> 06:13:46,280
you guys can laugh.
Oh No,

8433
06:13:46,290 --> 06:13:47,230
no.
We're not going to laugh.

8434
06:13:47,990 --> 06:13:49,960
You're right.
No one's going to laugh at you want

8435
06:13:49,980 --> 06:13:51,930
to pass that?
Do you want water?

8436
06:13:52,890 --> 06:13:53,723
You want some?
I don't know,

8437
06:13:53,830 --> 06:13:57,020
but I'm actually like really dizzy.
I think he needs a big nugget.

8438
06:13:57,050 --> 06:13:58,130
It's like I'm somebody.
Get on.

8439
06:13:59,040 --> 06:14:01,160
Can we get Joe's smart water?
Well,

8440
06:14:01,290 --> 06:14:03,870
we got you covered.
Joey is dizzy.

8441
06:14:06,040 --> 06:14:07,640
Build pool of milk.
I swelling.

8442
06:14:07,690 --> 06:14:08,430
He pays.
No,

8443
06:14:08,430 --> 06:14:09,263
we're not going to let you die.
If you do Saint Peter's gonna at those 

8444
06:14:13,380 --> 06:14:15,360
pearly white gates,
he's going to look at you and go,

8445
06:14:15,361 --> 06:14:16,194
Joey,
you atoned by eating those peppers for 

8446
06:14:19,021 --> 06:14:21,100
charity.
You atoned there,

8447
06:14:21,310 --> 06:14:22,143
Joe.
We've got another glass of water for 

8448
06:14:23,071 --> 06:14:24,090
you.
You're doing great.

8449
06:14:24,240 --> 06:14:25,790
I don't think I'd be able to survive the
reason.

8450
06:14:27,290 --> 06:14:28,230
Ah,
come on.

8451
06:14:28,380 --> 06:14:30,360
That's what we're here for.
Now can you get a shot?

8452
06:14:30,390 --> 06:14:32,730
There's a,
there's something floating kind of dark,

8453
06:14:32,840 --> 06:14:34,780
like a dark patch in there.
Can you get a shot of that?

8454
06:14:35,470 --> 06:14:37,430
What is that?
Oh,

8455
06:14:37,440 --> 06:14:41,940
Santa Shit from the beard now joey.
How's the heat?

8456
06:14:41,941 --> 06:14:44,190
Is it a kill it dude,

8457
06:14:44,200 --> 06:14:44,761
Joey,
tell me,

8458
06:14:44,761 --> 06:14:46,830
what are you feeling right now?
Is it getting worse or

8459
06:14:50,810 --> 06:14:51,643
but has the heat,
is it getting worse or is it staying 

8460
06:14:52,821 --> 06:14:53,810
about the same?
Are you

8461
06:14:54,020 --> 06:14:54,853
same now but like I know it's stuck in 
my teeth a little bit so if I like try 

8462
06:14:58,130 --> 06:15:01,210
to lodge it out,
I like reactivate so I'm just leaving.

8463
06:15:01,610 --> 06:15:02,860
I'll,
I'll deal with that later.

8464
06:15:03,230 --> 06:15:04,770
All right,
well there you have it.

8465
06:15:05,430 --> 06:15:08,610
This is Santa,
his lowest point and North Pole history,

8466
06:15:08,970 --> 06:15:09,803
but it was for a good cause and the kids
are definitely getting presence this 

8467
06:15:12,330 --> 06:15:13,163
year.
Fox.

8468
06:15:13,530 --> 06:15:15,270
Well let's,
why don't we show,

8469
06:15:15,271 --> 06:15:17,840

on back and let,

8470
06:15:18,120 --> 06:15:18,960
yeah,
we'll head on back.

8471
06:15:18,961 --> 06:15:22,140
We'll let Santa think about things here 
in the North Pole.

8472
06:15:22,440 --> 06:15:24,510
You just let us know if you need thing.
If you pass out,

8473
06:15:24,511 --> 06:15:25,344
we'll make sure not that you don't drown
in a pool of spoiled milk and I think 

8474
06:15:28,141 --> 06:15:31,440
you're a,
you are a hero and as Joey said you are,

8475
06:15:32,460 --> 06:15:34,740
you will be accepted by St Peter.
Okay.

8476
06:15:35,300 --> 06:15:36,510
All right.
This just got real,

8477
06:15:37,110 --> 06:15:40,320
real word now.
All right,

8478
06:15:40,321 --> 06:15:41,400
let's go back in there.
Yeah.

8479
06:15:47,480 --> 06:15:49,050
Good job.
Good job.

8480
06:15:51,410 --> 06:15:54,920

Keep her on it.

8482
06:15:56,690 --> 06:15:58,580
Yeah.

8483
06:15:58,581 --> 06:16:00,170

06:16:03,620 --> 06:16:05,210
Finally the screens picking up.

thank you so much.
Okay.

8487
06:16:06,321 --> 06:16:08,540
If there is a god,
he's against this.

8488
06:16:09,710 --> 06:16:11,060
If there's a god he's against 
everything.

8489
06:16:11,390 --> 06:16:13,580
All at one point we were thinking of 
letting them shit in there.

8490
06:16:13,581 --> 06:16:16,220
So don't say weed.
That was all on you.

8491
06:16:16,221 --> 06:16:18,470
He was like,
I'm not sure that's a no,

8492
06:16:20,180 --> 06:16:21,800
that's why you two are perfect for each 
other.

8493
06:16:21,950 --> 06:16:22,783
You guys both wanted to make it happen.

8496
06:16:28,551 --> 06:16:31,110

Well,

8500
06:16:36,750 --> 06:16:37,583
It's amazing.
There's a huge amount of money made in 

8501
06:16:39,370 --> 06:16:41,780
nation considering that we had a little 
bit of tech issues.

8502
06:16:41,781 --> 06:16:43,340
You know what I mean?

this is only the first

8506
06:16:48,220 --> 06:16:49,053
day.
We're going to have a week of these 

8507
06:16:50,261 --> 06:16:53,840
prizes up there.
Um,

8508
06:16:53,950 --> 06:16:55,630
well I dunno,
should we wrap it up?

8509
06:16:55,631 --> 06:16:57,340
Should we share it?
Feel like,

8510
06:16:57,341 --> 06:16:58,660
uh,
what else?

8511
06:16:59,360 --> 06:17:00,550
You Ready?
I think that's a high end.

8512
06:17:00,551 --> 06:17:05,551
A little ready to wrap it up.
I mean,

8513
06:17:06,281 --> 06:17:09,550
we started at three,
which at six and a half hours,

8514
06:17:10,050 --> 06:17:11,980
which we're starting to hit that,
starting to hit that wall.

8515
06:17:12,230 --> 06:17:16,180
We'll try not trying to fucking call,
call it a half day.

8516
06:17:16,900 --> 06:17:18,220
I mean,
come on guys.

8517
06:17:18,790 --> 06:17:21,230
Bushings go in.
So if that means anything.

8518
06:17:21,231 --> 06:17:21,461
Yeah,
no,

8519
06:17:21,461 --> 06:17:23,210
I'm good.
Hey,

8520
06:17:23,400 --> 06:17:24,910
I know a lot of people going,

8521
06:17:24,911 --> 06:17:26,710

8522
06:17:26,730 --> 06:17:29,970
Who would rate for us?
I'm impressed with royal and stamina.

8523
06:17:29,980 --> 06:17:32,590
This guy's running shows.
Three video games.

8524
06:17:33,280 --> 06:17:36,080
Uh,
20 hour live stream.

8525
06:17:36,860 --> 06:17:40,510
I'm just trying to make sure that we at 
this rate,

8526
06:17:41,020 --> 06:17:45,190
I think we would take us like another 
two hours to hit 100,000

8527
06:17:45,191 --> 06:17:47,010
and I'm not sure at least,
dude,

8528
06:17:47,290 --> 06:17:48,190
here's what we're going to do.

8529
06:17:48,670 --> 06:17:49,503
We're going to push.
I don't know that Joe has got to eat 

8530
06:17:50,921 --> 06:17:54,430
that.
We're going to push for one more hour.

8531
06:17:54,431 --> 06:17:57,470
What time is it right now?
We're not going to make it.

8532
06:17:57,500 --> 06:17:58,333
You're not going to make it dude.
It's nine 39 30 by 10 30 we have to do 

8533
06:18:04,481 --> 06:18:08,260

Everybody please hold going.

8534
06:18:08,350 --> 06:18:12,490
Get to 105 by 10 30 cause we are going 
to stop at 10 30 we have to,

8535
06:18:12,491 --> 06:18:16,550

8538
06:18:19,931 --> 06:18:20,764
We have to believe.
Should we do another part time down 

8539
06:18:23,411 --> 06:18:25,060
here?
What are we going to do for an hour?

8540
06:18:25,500 --> 06:18:26,333
Yeah,
we've kind of done all the things that 

8541
06:18:28,170 --> 06:18:31,160
eat the peppers.
They called the drawings.

8542
06:18:31,180 --> 06:18:32,550
Build a skateboard.
All right,

8543
06:18:32,560 --> 06:18:36,610
well we're at 77,000
we did you guys,

8544
06:18:37,180 --> 06:18:41,050
is there any chance we can raise another
$23,000

8545
06:18:41,080 --> 06:18:41,913
I'm not sure.

8546
06:18:42,220 --> 06:18:43,390
I'm not sure.
Yeah,

8547
06:18:43,391 --> 06:18:44,224
I'm not sure.
Nobody's even beaten shredder as a top 

8548
06:18:46,241 --> 06:18:47,380
donor.
You know what I mean?

8549
06:18:47,381 --> 06:18:48,214
Like I mean,
I could kick down another thousand that 

8550
06:18:51,611 --> 06:18:54,160
would put me out like 5,000
if we just,

8551
06:18:54,340 --> 06:18:55,900
okay guys,
this is what we gotta do.

8552
06:18:55,901 --> 06:18:59,380
Everyone watching,
just send a link to your friend,

8553
06:18:59,480 --> 06:19:02,110
send a link to that friend.
Every link gets,

8554
06:19:02,170 --> 06:19:05,770
if you say you do that whole thing where
it's like if you don't spread this to 12

8555
06:19:05,771 --> 06:19:06,604
friends,
you die and like an hour lions 

8556
06:19:08,540 --> 06:19:13,370
threatened whole thing.
I mean friends overseas,

8557
06:19:13,420 --> 06:19:14,253
should we do another guy?
They got to get to how or we have to do 

8558
06:19:17,621 --> 06:19:18,760
it.
We have to do it.

8559
06:19:18,761 --> 06:19:19,594
It will be the best for you.
For us in the studio and also for the 

8560
06:19:22,151 --> 06:19:22,984
world and for the poor vern.
Burn and burn victims a little inspired 

8561
06:19:27,071 --> 06:19:28,180
right now.
That wasn't,

8562
06:19:28,480 --> 06:19:32,870
that was the cat backstage.
You inspired to eat a pepper.

8563
06:19:34,950 --> 06:19:38,770
It's hard time down here.
Uh,

8564
06:19:38,860 --> 06:19:39,580
Dan,
can you,

8565
06:19:39,580 --> 06:19:41,800
can you give joey the Mike and switched 
to him?

8566
06:19:41,801 --> 06:19:42,634
Let's get,
let's talk to Joe and see if he's up 

8567
06:19:45,150 --> 06:19:45,983
shot.
I

8568
06:19:46,030 --> 06:19:51,030
don't know that joey can eat another 
pepper because Joe said he's in.

8569
06:19:51,251 --> 06:19:52,084
He's ready.
He's ready to push it to the limit to 

8570
06:19:54,350 --> 06:19:55,630
raise.
It's um,

8571
06:19:56,390 --> 06:19:58,790
it's about,
I feel it working its way to my asshole.

8572
06:19:58,900 --> 06:19:59,733
Ah,
so I don't know if you want to get up 

8573
06:20:01,760 --> 06:20:04,160
bathroom cam going.
Are you throwing up there?

8574
06:20:05,130 --> 06:20:09,230
We're going to do this.
You look like a hero.

8575
06:20:11,930 --> 06:20:15,360
Saddam Hussein popping out of that hole 
after her.

8576
06:20:15,380 --> 06:20:17,240
It was,
my mouth is perfectly fine.

8577
06:20:17,241 --> 06:20:17,900
It's like just,

8578
06:20:17,900 --> 06:20:20,210
Oh my God.
It's boiling this stomach.

8579
06:20:20,300 --> 06:20:22,050
Oh No,
you're all right.

8580
06:20:23,030 --> 06:20:25,670
I'm just going to break my Kito Diet.
Give me a fucking pizza.

8581
06:20:26,590 --> 06:20:28,780
There's a fucking pizza.
Hey.

8582
06:20:30,150 --> 06:20:31,880
Hell No.
It's worse now.

8583
06:20:31,881 --> 06:20:33,110
Joey,

8584
06:20:33,230 --> 06:20:36,290
If we get 100,000

8591
06:20:45,951 --> 06:20:50,390
We're all in this together.
How are we going to do this guys?

8592

How many people are still watching this?

8601
06:21:18,891 --> 06:21:19,870
It's so late.
Yeah.

8602
06:21:19,880 --> 06:21:22,280
At this power,
how many audience members do we have?

8603
06:21:22,370 --> 06:21:25,130
A,
it looks like we're at about 15 k,

8604
06:21:25,131 --> 06:21:27,380
which we've been at for the last like 
hour and a half.

8605
06:21:27,381 --> 06:21:28,970
It's kind of holding steady at this 
point.

8606
06:21:29,060 --> 06:21:31,440
I don't know if we can,
everybody who's still watching and tries

8607
06:21:31,450 --> 06:21:32,590

the people have forgotten about the like
people who have already moved on.

8616
06:21:55,130 --> 06:21:57,080
Yeah,
that's part of the problem.

8617
06:21:57,720 --> 06:22:00,140
And that's true.
But that's also part of the problem.

8618
06:22:00,141 --> 06:22:03,590
Why it's the last,
it's a tough time.

8619
06:22:04,820 --> 06:22:09,820
Last time we did it,
it was like right as it was in September

8620
06:22:10,551 --> 06:22:14,060
to when people didn't show what a 
fucking shit show humanity is.

8621
06:22:14,061 --> 06:22:14,894
Man,

8622
06:22:14,950 --> 06:22:16,370
we are fucked as a,

8623
06:22:16,371 --> 06:22:17,720

We're just a parasite on this planet 
because listen,

8625
06:22:20,440 --> 06:22:22,880

You need to give them hope.

06:22:23,690 --> 06:22:25,480
Hope.
Give me some fucking smoke.

8627
06:22:26,780 --> 06:22:27,613
By the way.

06:22:30,610 --> 06:22:32,570

it.

8630
06:22:33,380 --> 06:22:35,660
I want to see what Ellis thinks about 
all of that.

8631
06:22:36,800 --> 06:22:39,140

8634
06:22:43,470 --> 06:22:43,980

8636
06:22:46,940 --> 06:22:47,700

8637
06:22:47,700 --> 06:22:50,550
I don't know if it was exactly her that 
pushed us over the edge,

8638
06:22:50,551 --> 06:22:55,551
but she doped from home donated another 
$200 and she said,

Isla said everyone was donating those a 

8645
06:23:16,231 --> 06:23:17,610

Your tenacity,

8646
06:23:17,611 --> 06:23:19,980
Justin,

8647

I'm the about these port for victim.
What about the burn victims?

8648
06:23:26,251 --> 06:23:27,084
All right.

8649
06:23:29,731 --> 06:23:32,730

06:23:35,880 --> 06:23:36,713
I do do this shit for free.
How many people or how many people are 

8652
06:23:39,001 --> 06:23:40,920
watching right now?
15,000.

8653
06:23:41,640 --> 06:23:45,480
It's actually climbing every single 
person watching donated two bucks.

8654
06:23:45,570 --> 06:23:47,670
We'd be golden is,
I'm not even kidding.

8655
06:23:47,850 --> 06:23:49,800
We have to hit a hundred.
How can we share this?

8656
06:23:50,760 --> 06:23:52,020
I came here today.
Go.

8657
06:23:52,050 --> 06:23:53,280
Should we share this?
Should I like,

8658
06:23:53,281 --> 06:23:54,114

You know what Justin type is working on 

8659
06:23:57,890 --> 06:24:00,460

Okay.

8660
06:24:00,540 --> 06:24:01,373
All right.
All right.

8661
06:24:01,680 --> 06:24:03,870
Can you put up a cup of coffee?
We're going all the way.

8662
06:24:04,390 --> 06:24:09,390
Here we go.
Doing this or doing this.

8663
06:24:10,740 --> 06:24:15,340
Close to calling an uber,
but Justin's no is firing me the fuck.

8664
06:24:15,341 --> 06:24:17,700
Let me right now.
Let me just promote this more.

8665
06:24:17,701 --> 06:24:18,660
So here,
Justin,

8666
06:24:18,661 --> 06:24:23,460
do more yelling for my,

8667
06:24:23,461 --> 06:24:24,780
raise money.
Tuna.

8668
06:24:25,170 --> 06:24:29,580
It's the final hours.
If the final is the final,

8669
06:24:29,581 --> 06:24:30,414
our final,
final fucking these poor people in 

8670
06:24:35,011 --> 06:24:40,011
California,

8671
06:24:40,111 --> 06:24:40,944
I'm convinced.

8672
06:24:44,310 --> 06:24:47,520
Perfect.
That's going everywhere.

8673
06:24:48,570 --> 06:24:50,160
Justin,

8674
06:24:50,170 --> 06:24:52,290
Mister fucking who?
Midnight Hour.

8675
06:24:52,500 --> 06:24:55,710
Send a tweet out man.
Of course I'm going to,

8676
06:24:55,711 --> 06:24:58,750
I'm building a Goddamn skateboard that 
we're going to put up for that.

8677
06:24:58,860 --> 06:24:59,693
By the way,
this skateboard signed by Paul 

8678
06:25:02,340 --> 06:25:03,630
Rodriguez.
It's signed by weight.

8679
06:25:03,631 --> 06:25:05,250
Is that?
Oh,

8680
06:25:05,251 --> 06:25:06,750
thank you Maggie.
Thank you.

8681
06:25:06,751 --> 06:25:08,910
Uh,

8682
06:25:09,490 --> 06:25:14,490
a c k nine k nine seat keeps coming back
from war drawing donations back on.

8683
06:25:20,310 --> 06:25:21,600
Donations are off,
Dan.

8684
06:25:21,660 --> 06:25:23,280
All right,
let me get him back.

8685
06:25:23,700 --> 06:25:28,700
I'd send them to expire anyway and then,
and then when we're done,

8686
06:25:32,350 --> 06:25:33,183
turn them off.
We need your help to reach 110 can I 

8687
06:25:35,911 --> 06:25:36,980
just say that?
Uh,

8688
06:25:37,470 --> 06:25:41,030
this skateboard is like literally 
exactly how I would,

8689
06:25:42,000 --> 06:25:44,440
this would be my skateboard.
Thank you.

8690
06:25:44,441 --> 06:25:46,720
Talk to panda.
Thank you.

8691
06:25:46,721 --> 06:25:47,740
Our Bas.

Tall.
Cool.

8693
06:25:49,150 --> 06:25:51,250

8695
06:25:52,890 --> 06:25:54,310
Bro.
You think of another place.

8696
06:25:54,610 --> 06:25:56,630
Okay,
so Alex,

8697
06:25:56,650 --> 06:25:57,720
you should do a site.
Oh Man,

8698
06:25:58,440 --> 06:26:00,640

I get stressed out,

8699
06:26:00,641 --> 06:26:01,840

Show it off.

8700
06:26:01,841 --> 06:26:02,950
Showed off.
Can you,

8701
06:26:03,530 --> 06:26:04,480

8702
06:26:04,510 --> 06:26:06,820

8703
06:26:06,821 --> 06:26:08,980
look at Joe and get a shot of joy where 
you get a shout of joy.

8704
06:26:09,040 --> 06:26:12,550
I'm going to the bathroom.
Get a shot of joe going in the bathroom.

8705
06:26:12,990 --> 06:26:16,390
When you show this off.
We can see going to shit.

8706
06:26:16,800 --> 06:26:18,280
Wait,
is he asking him if he's going to shit?

8707
06:26:18,281 --> 06:26:21,340
Ask him what he's going to shit based on
his speed.

8708
06:26:21,341 --> 06:26:23,100
He's definitely going in the hall

8709
06:26:24,000 --> 06:26:24,840
on your,
on your,

8710
06:26:24,990 --> 06:26:26,100

So go ahead.

8711
06:26:26,430 --> 06:26:27,510
I'm doing socials.
Okay.

8712
06:26:28,070 --> 06:26:28,850
Oh,

8713
06:26:28,850 --> 06:26:30,170
okay.
I don't want to fuck anything up.

8714
06:26:30,720 --> 06:26:32,370
Bump it.
But guys,

8715
06:26:32,371 --> 06:26:33,010

8716
06:26:33,010 --> 06:26:35,010

this is a skateboard.

8717
06:26:35,310 --> 06:26:37,510
This has got some risers.
Uh,

8718
06:26:37,560 --> 06:26:40,260
as you can see,
it's got a really cool grip tape.

8719
06:26:40,890 --> 06:26:43,560
It's one of my faves.
Um,

8720
06:26:43,860 --> 06:26:46,410
and uh,
this is a morty skateboard.

8721
06:26:46,411 --> 06:26:49,460
Those I drew all over morty shirt.
Uh,

8722
06:26:49,470 --> 06:26:50,370

8723
06:26:50,371 --> 06:26:51,330

8724
06:26:51,331 --> 06:26:54,210
we got,
who drew on a isla?

8725
06:26:54,211 --> 06:26:56,040
Isla,
Isla sign right there.

8726
06:26:56,730 --> 06:26:58,740
Oh God.
We've got to get the light on it.

8727
06:26:58,741 --> 06:27:00,750
There it is.
It's a foil.

8728
06:27:00,751 --> 06:27:02,670
It's a foil deck.
So it's like very,

8729
06:27:02,880 --> 06:27:03,713
very,
very,

8730
06:27:04,050 --> 06:27:06,270
very light sensitive.
Paul Rodriguez,

8731
06:27:06,840 --> 06:27:08,490
who was the,
uh,

8732
06:27:09,930 --> 06:27:13,110
I feel like he might've been the 
instigator of all these decks.

8733
06:27:13,200 --> 06:27:14,550
I don't know.
100%,

8734
06:27:14,551 --> 06:27:19,551
but I know he's a bad ass skateboarder.
I hope I'm going to say yes.

8735
06:27:19,980 --> 06:27:21,780
I'm just a dumb dumb.
But anyways,

8736
06:27:21,840 --> 06:27:22,950
uh,
and then,

8737
06:27:22,951 --> 06:27:23,611

8741
06:27:29,250 --> 06:27:30,870
Alex drew here.
Sorry.

8742
06:27:30,910 --> 06:27:32,130
Oh,

8743
06:27:32,350 --> 06:27:35,580
William and uh,

8744
06:27:35,581 --> 06:27:37,420
So this,

8745
06:27:37,800 --> 06:27:42,800

All right Justin,

8746
06:27:47,731 --> 06:27:51,450
drop the skateboard.
I am covered in water.

8747
06:27:51,451 --> 06:27:52,284
The computer is covered in water.
Justin dropped the skateboard and all 

8748
06:27:54,901 --> 06:27:57,420
the electronic keys now scooping water 
onto my lap.

8749
06:27:57,440 --> 06:28:01,620
We are all still hold sober right now.
We're just exhausted and that's why this

8750
06:28:01,621 --> 06:28:03,540
has just been knocked.
The mic over.

8751
06:28:03,541 --> 06:28:06,280
Justin is drunk for sure.
Um,

8752
06:28:06,510 --> 06:28:07,343
so we have a bit of a travesty here.
Everyone is scrambling to clean the 

8753
06:28:10,231 --> 06:28:12,750
water on the desk.
We have water on the laptop,

8754
06:28:12,751 --> 06:28:14,670
make sure it's coming in clutch with the
towels.

8755
06:28:14,910 --> 06:28:15,780
Zach,

8756
06:28:15,781 --> 06:28:16,614
Sarah swarming with paper towels.
Dan is in there quick with the paper 

8757
06:28:19,111 --> 06:28:20,730
towels.
I've got water on the mic.

8758
06:28:20,731 --> 06:28:23,010
I've got water on my pants as well.
They're all over the place.

8759
06:28:23,160 --> 06:28:26,790
The mic is all loose and Goosey.
We need some bag or we need some quick,

8760
06:28:26,791 --> 06:28:28,980
we need some male stimulates here.
We need a fluffer.

8761
06:28:29,900 --> 06:28:34,290
Juston keeps trying to pitch.
The escape party is not missed a beat.

8762
06:28:34,291 --> 06:28:35,124
We are in the middle of a travesty and 
Justin is pitching the skateboard as we 

8763
06:28:39,410 --> 06:28:40,243
to everybody tuning in,
who is wondering what is going on 

8764
06:28:41,631 --> 06:28:44,150
because I just tweeted this out.

06:28:48,020 --> 06:28:50,710
Justin continues to spray water 
everywhere.

8767
06:28:50,910 --> 06:28:51,743
He's been to scale.

8768
06:28:54,290 --> 06:28:57,860
Welcome to our nine of the h three h

That was a quick APP by everybody.
Excellent work.

8771
06:29:06,280 --> 06:29:10,000
The donation screen went unresponsive.
How do we make that thing a shit?

8772
06:29:10,040 --> 06:29:15,040
How do we fix that Biz?
Everything is falling apart.

8773
06:29:16,050 --> 06:29:18,470
Refresh.
God himself is trying to stop this.

8774
06:29:18,500 --> 06:29:19,333

Oh No.
Is the Internet down?

8777
06:29:25,370 --> 06:29:27,440
What's going on right now?
Just in broke.

8778
06:29:27,441 --> 06:29:29,900
The fucking everything is good,

8779
06:29:29,930 --> 06:29:34,430
But the page isn't loading.
It's loading on this monitor right here.

8780
06:29:34,460 --> 06:29:35,930
So you fucked my computer.

8781
06:29:38,960 --> 06:29:39,793
Probably.
There's water all over the electronics 

8782
06:29:41,151 --> 06:29:42,130

Down.

8783
06:29:42,530 --> 06:29:43,350
No,

8784
06:29:43,350 --> 06:29:44,183
You're fine.
There's a bunch of water on the table 

8785
06:29:46,790 --> 06:29:51,200

06:30:34,660 --> 06:30:36,260
Wait,

8802
06:30:36,261 --> 06:30:38,210
That you spilled water on your fucking 
bitch.

8803
06:30:38,600 --> 06:30:42,320
You do it on camera.
Fuck you justin.

8804
06:30:42,321 --> 06:30:45,350
Reuland people look into the camera and 
tell him,

8805
06:30:45,650 --> 06:30:47,480
tell him how you really feel.
Ethan,

8806
06:30:47,900 --> 06:30:49,760

Okay,

8807
06:30:49,761 --> 06:30:52,710

Oh,

8808
06:30:53,660 --> 06:30:56,900

Oh,

8809
06:31:01,340 --> 06:31:04,640
I'm going to build it on a skateboard.
I'm going to build another skateboard.

8810
06:31:04,670 --> 06:31:05,560
Well hold on,
hold on.

8811
06:31:05,990 --> 06:31:06,823
I think it's a skateboard.

8812
06:31:08,870 --> 06:31:13,320
for hang on now tweeted out justin and 
I'll do and I'll make a plea.

Tell Him we need help.
The link to your social media.

8814
06:31:18,950 --> 06:31:22,380
No one cares about me.
Weed it out regionally.

8815
06:31:22,400 --> 06:31:24,580

8817
06:31:25,250 --> 06:31:26,083
On what?
A platform and instagram and I did a 

8818
06:31:28,140 --> 06:31:29,990
story.
I did everything then.

8819
06:31:30,710 --> 06:31:32,090
Oh,

8820
06:31:32,091 --> 06:31:33,680

06:31:41,490 --> 06:31:46,490
You're doing it.

8828
06:31:47,011 --> 06:31:49,860
Oh my God.
Talk to your fancy.

8829
06:31:50,280 --> 06:31:55,280
It's Ted to talk to everybody.
Huge bubble blesses.

8830
06:31:59,330 --> 06:32:02,460
Cub it out to everybody.
This is our seven.

8831
06:32:02,610 --> 06:32:05,120
You think this is a fucking joke?
No,

8832
06:32:05,121 --> 06:32:08,480
don't hit me with that music jazz.
I want some real shit.

8833
06:32:08,520 --> 06:32:13,410
Let me give up some like give them some 
like really hardcore heart.

8834
06:32:15,400 --> 06:32:17,560
Listen,
we're over 81,000

8835
06:32:17,561 --> 06:32:19,240
now.
This is the seventh hour.

8836
06:32:19,241 --> 06:32:20,920
You think we're going everywhere?
No.

8837
06:32:21,010 --> 06:32:22,570
$1,
$2.

8838
06:32:22,571 --> 06:32:25,520
Three,
five every fucking dollar account.

8839
06:32:25,700 --> 06:32:28,940
Because they love the fuckers up north.
Oh,

8840
06:32:28,941 --> 06:32:31,520
when my house burned down,
Oh,

8841
06:32:31,521 --> 06:32:32,120
poor me.

8842
06:32:32,120 --> 06:32:32,953
Well that's why we'll come in and help 
you out because they're not little cry 

8843
06:32:35,681 --> 06:32:38,480
babies.
They lost everything and we,

8844
06:32:38,720 --> 06:32:43,450
we'd have everything and that's why it 
just did.

8845
06:32:43,460 --> 06:32:45,230
I don't have everything.
I mean like,

8846
06:32:45,260 --> 06:32:47,250
Oh,

8847
06:32:47,260 --> 06:32:51,290
His screen I love good at do I of those 
like go swimming pools.

8848
06:32:51,291 --> 06:32:56,291
They have it a Mandalay bay now.
They've all their goddamn houses.

8849
06:32:58,250 --> 06:33:02,150
You got $1 in your bank account.
That makes a big difference.

8850
06:33:02,360 --> 06:33:04,390
It's December.
I know I'm not.

8851
06:33:05,280 --> 06:33:07,610
I bet all your needs,
your house.

8852
06:33:08,180 --> 06:33:11,600
You don't care about the fire victim 
because that happened a while ago.

8853
06:33:13,010 --> 06:33:15,720
Let let's stop eating.
Stop even stop Viva.

8854
06:33:15,740 --> 06:33:17,000
No more Ethan.
Okay.

8855
06:33:17,270 --> 06:33:18,103
Hey Sue,
it's too abrasive to embrace risk from 

8856
06:33:20,040 --> 06:33:24,310
squanch was the donator for $500 so 
Chris from,

8857
06:33:24,960 --> 06:33:29,180
and he asked her or a drawing of a power
baby on a Ethan's face.

8858
06:33:29,180 --> 06:33:30,120
I,
Justin,

8859
06:33:30,121 --> 06:33:30,910
do you know what that means?
Yeah,

8860
06:33:30,910 --> 06:33:31,880
absolutely.
All right,

8861
06:33:31,940 --> 06:33:33,690
well let's get a power of 80 gone.
By the way.

8862

package up yet?

8864
06:33:40,800 --> 06:33:42,030
Uh,
let me check.

8865
06:33:42,060 --> 06:33:42,893
Hold on a second.
We should put the squanch games package 

8866
06:33:44,521 --> 06:33:45,354
up and we should talk about that for a 
second while I get really passionate 

8867
06:33:49,980 --> 06:33:52,260
about really seriously getting to a 
hundred grand.

8868
06:33:52,410 --> 06:33:56,370
No Zack Cause I've just hitting that.
That's somebody in there.

8869
06:33:56,480 --> 06:33:57,313
I think Alex is jewelry that goes out.
We're about to introduce a whole nother 

8870
06:34:01,531 --> 06:34:02,364
tier of shit you can throw your money 
into to win because God dammit we are 

8871
06:34:07,611 --> 06:34:08,444

we're living in a world where it's time 

8872
06:34:12,381 --> 06:34:13,214
to fucking get serious.
Someone's got to do it and win or not 

8873
06:34:17,751 --> 06:34:18,830
win,
but you know,

8874
06:34:18,980 --> 06:34:23,980
get us up to a hundred grand so that we 
can help these poor they were fuck sake.

8875
06:34:29,430 --> 06:34:34,130
Cause number one I got to draw power 
baby.

8876
06:34:34,131 --> 06:34:36,120
You keep it cut a lose

8877
06:34:36,120 --> 06:34:36,953
in our mind for Alpha two why do I feel 
like you're sexually assaulted me every 

8878
06:34:42,341 --> 06:34:43,174
time your fingers in my mouth,
we deal with the devil that by 

8879
06:34:47,321 --> 06:34:49,520
sovereignty at least a little bit too 
much.

8880
06:34:51,550 --> 06:34:56,550
I'm going to cough in your face.
Thousands of dollars as a up.

8881
06:35:05,010 --> 06:35:05,940
There it is

8882

8898
06:35:38,460 --> 06:35:39,001

I can't say when,

A dollar.

8913
06:36:14,860 --> 06:36:16,960
Um,
I haven't seen this.

8914
06:36:16,961 --> 06:36:18,090

prize pack.

8917
06:36:21,301 --> 06:36:22,380
This is a video game.
That's,

8918
06:36:22,381 --> 06:36:24,150
this is my game.
I've played it.

8919
06:36:24,210 --> 06:36:25,250
It's incredible.
I completed,

8920
06:36:25,260 --> 06:36:29,610
it's stupid fucking crazy.
It plays both in Vr and uh,

8921
06:36:29,611 --> 06:36:31,050
on a regular,
you know,

8922
06:36:31,590 --> 06:36:33,180
right.
Like non vr.

8923
06:36:33,210 --> 06:36:36,140
So you don't need vr to play it.
It's really fun and non vr.

8924
06:36:36,880 --> 06:36:39,500
He climbing inside Justin's brain.

8925
06:36:40,040 --> 06:36:40,873
It's pretty surreal experience.
Now vr is the preferred method of 

8926
06:36:43,390 --> 06:36:45,090
playing justin.
No,

8927
06:36:45,091 --> 06:36:46,340
no dude,
it's so much fun.

8928
06:36:47,130 --> 06:36:47,701
Oh,
it's great.

8929
06:36:47,701 --> 06:36:48,720
Either way.
It's great.

8930
06:36:48,721 --> 06:36:49,554
Either way.
I don't like rotating my chair marriage 

8931
06:36:52,891 --> 06:36:55,170
to work correctly.
Your chair got damaged.

8932
06:36:55,530 --> 06:36:56,960
Just use the right thumb.
Stick to it.

8933
06:36:57,010 --> 06:37:01,370
And I went out here.
No,

8934
06:37:01,380 --> 06:37:02,820
I'm hearing it.
A little bit of crack.

8935
06:37:02,850 --> 06:37:03,630
Oh wait,
a stop.

8936
06:37:03,630 --> 06:37:06,180
There's some crisis.
I think the video might be cracking.

8937
06:37:07,260 --> 06:37:09,900
Try to a different video.
Let me just play this dumb shit.

8938
06:37:10,170 --> 06:37:12,660
Let's see.
Oh,

8939
06:37:12,661 --> 06:37:14,580
I hear crack.
Oh wait one second.

8940
06:37:14,770 --> 06:37:15,603
Yeah,
maybe went into the speakers or went 

8941
06:37:16,720 --> 06:37:21,080
into the call me mister crackle.
By the way,

8942
06:37:21,300 --> 06:37:24,630
when I get pumped up and I want to 
fucking raise money for a charity,

8943
06:37:24,631 --> 06:37:25,464
I caused crackling and people's computer
by spilling drinks and water everywhere 

8944
06:37:29,970 --> 06:37:32,340
and I will do it every single time.
Okay,

8945
06:37:32,370 --> 06:37:33,920
so if you want to invite me to a

8946
06:37:34,310 --> 06:37:35,143
money raising stream,
I will spill crackled juice in your 

8947
06:37:38,250 --> 06:37:41,190
computer.
Donation donation.

8948
06:37:41,730 --> 06:37:44,190
Moving right along.
Katy.

8949
06:37:44,820 --> 06:37:46,340
Dan,
can you tell me why Jay,

8950
06:37:46,370 --> 06:37:47,203
when Joey in and creed?
Haley just texted me that he's having a 

8951
06:37:49,341 --> 06:37:50,780
rough time in bathroom.
Really?

8952
06:37:50,781 --> 06:37:51,860
Yeah.
All right,

8953
06:37:51,861 --> 06:37:53,900
well let's let him have that rough time.
We can.

8954
06:37:53,970 --> 06:37:56,630
It's probably going to be just enough to
get us to a hundred.

8955
06:37:56,660 --> 06:38:00,680
I think we're again,
I think we do a hundred in the bathroom.

8956
06:38:02,100 --> 06:38:03,240
Maybe you can phone,
maybe.

8957
06:38:03,420 --> 06:38:05,070
Can you ask him to do a little 
interview?

8958
06:38:05,770 --> 06:38:06,460
Hot,
hot.

8959
06:38:06,460 --> 06:38:07,293
Hot.
Yeah.

8960
06:38:07,580 --> 06:38:10,340
How about Paul Paul in Joe calling from 
the bath,

8961
06:38:10,420 --> 06:38:12,320
calling from the bathroom.
Justin.

8962
06:38:12,321 --> 06:38:13,154
Josh.
Josh wants to know how do we get to the 

8963
06:38:14,631 --> 06:38:17,840
secret zoo level asks Jack.
Oh man,

8964
06:38:17,841 --> 06:38:19,460
dude,
the Zeke secrets you level.

8965
06:38:19,461 --> 06:38:22,250
It's like one of the most difficult 
because not only did,

8966
06:38:22,320 --> 06:38:23,870
not only did the crows,
crows,

8967
06:38:23,871 --> 06:38:24,200
crows,

8968
06:38:24,200 --> 06:38:25,130
guys,
Kelly on the line.

8969
06:38:25,640 --> 06:38:27,500
Oh here.
Hold on one second.

8970
06:38:27,940 --> 06:38:30,290
So guys,
we have Joey Salads.

8971
06:38:30,291 --> 06:38:32,360
Who's in the stall right now having a 
rough time.

8972
06:38:32,570 --> 06:38:33,920
Joey,
you're on the air.

8973
06:38:34,310 --> 06:38:36,860
Oh my bad call.
A static not static.

8974
06:38:38,000 --> 06:38:38,840
Can you hear me all right

8975
06:38:39,280 --> 06:38:42,700
cause I spill water everywhere.
Healing Buddy.

8976
06:38:42,730 --> 06:38:43,563
Sorry.

8977
06:38:45,390 --> 06:38:46,590
Oh,
is that how you feeling?

8978
06:38:48,020 --> 06:38:48,910
It's like it out.

8979
06:38:49,270 --> 06:38:51,040
You like buttholes.
So Joe,

8980
06:38:51,041 --> 06:38:51,874
you like bottles

8981
06:38:52,550 --> 06:38:53,720
Dan,
it's not working.

8982
06:38:53,721 --> 06:38:58,721
So maybe ask him to just record a little
update for us is not a voice update.

8983
06:39:00,740 --> 06:39:01,970
Oh No,
it is signed by.

8984
06:39:02,420 --> 06:39:04,130
Do we have any,
I'm writing updates.

8985
06:39:04,131 --> 06:39:04,964
Dan.

8986
06:39:06,620 --> 06:39:08,170
Uh,
I'll check.

8987
06:39:08,320 --> 06:39:09,153
Okay.

8988
06:39:09,940 --> 06:39:13,180
We don't fill that bag up.

8989
06:39:13,350 --> 06:39:14,330
Wow.
We are the,

8990
06:39:14,440 --> 06:39:17,070
we're up to 83 guys.
We were up to 83.

8991
06:39:17,200 --> 06:39:18,930
Oh it gets off.
We are moving.

8992
06:39:19,490 --> 06:39:21,030
We are moving.
Then you put the uh,

8993
06:39:21,031 --> 06:39:21,661
the,
the,

8994
06:39:21,661 --> 06:39:23,880
the,
the trover saves the universe.

8995
06:39:23,881 --> 06:39:24,714
Perko yeah.
So I can just tell everyone what that 

8996
06:39:26,341 --> 06:39:26,940
is,
right?

8997
06:39:26,940 --> 06:39:27,540
Oh,
he fixed your,

8998
06:39:27,540 --> 06:39:29,610
rotate my chair.
I still repeat.

8999
06:39:29,611 --> 06:39:30,061
Okay.
So,

9000
06:39:30,061 --> 06:39:31,890
so this is just the beginning of the 
game.

9001
06:39:31,891 --> 06:39:32,724
This was like just this is a dressing 
are too fucking game but ground or the 

9002
06:39:36,341 --> 06:39:38,840
thing it's an adventure game.
You're,

9003
06:39:39,430 --> 06:39:40,263
you're a co op.
It's a cooperation and interact with 

9004
06:39:42,211 --> 06:39:44,940
them by pressing on yourself.
First person,

9005
06:39:44,941 --> 06:39:46,710
third person.
They don't have time for this right now.

9006
06:39:46,720 --> 06:39:48,470
Action,
exploration,

9007
06:39:48,480 --> 06:39:50,180
comedy.
We need adventure.

9008
06:39:51,560 --> 06:39:54,360
And when you have a cool pack for 
people,

9009
06:39:55,380 --> 06:39:56,213
donate,
donate to the cause and you're going to 

9010
06:39:59,181 --> 06:40:02,310
get all kinds of rare shit that no one 
else will get it.

9011
06:40:02,880 --> 06:40:03,340
Yeah,

9012
06:40:03,340 --> 06:40:04,780
it's still playing.
I just muted it.

9013
06:40:05,000 --> 06:40:07,870
We're going to get a bunch of fucking 
cool shit that no one else will get.

9014
06:40:07,960 --> 06:40:08,793
And this is the only game maybe ever 
made in history where the plot involves 

9015
06:40:12,610 --> 06:40:13,443
a monster who steals your pet dogs and 
uses the dogs to go into his eye holes 

9016
06:40:16,661 --> 06:40:17,494
and power is,
but then also you find out that he's 

9017
06:40:19,121 --> 06:40:22,390
part of a weird collective of like 
beings.

9018
06:40:22,391 --> 06:40:26,170
It can see every version of the future 
and it's fucking insane.

9019
06:40:26,200 --> 06:40:29,420
None of that red dead redemption.
I'm muting none of that in Super Mario.

9020
06:40:32,330 --> 06:40:33,140
Hey,
open up.

9021
06:40:33,140 --> 06:40:33,973
Come out here.

9022
06:40:36,080 --> 06:40:38,710
Sounds a lot like some other characters.
I,

9023
06:40:38,760 --> 06:40:41,180
that's my fault.
It's definitely the right place.

9024
06:40:41,210 --> 06:40:42,043
You're the one,
we don't have time to get into it right 

9025
06:40:44,001 --> 06:40:44,834
now,
but you're coming.

9026
06:40:47,080 --> 06:40:47,913
Oh,
this is the funniest shit ever because 

9027
06:40:48,520 --> 06:40:49,353
full ground points,
it wasn't breaking numerous giant big 

9028
06:40:51,351 --> 06:40:52,760
monster.
You heard that right?

9029
06:40:52,790 --> 06:40:53,623
A motherfucker giant damn near half the 
city stolen science equipment 

9030
06:40:58,580 --> 06:41:03,580
microscopes because I'm talking about 
that's a great idea.

9031
06:41:05,430 --> 06:41:09,420
Hundred dollars and they are powered 
him.

9032
06:41:10,440 --> 06:41:12,490
I've never seen,
he's scared people.

9033
06:41:12,510 --> 06:41:16,300
My grandmother's afraid.
Your dogs.

9034
06:41:19,070 --> 06:41:19,903
Literally.
That's the beginning of the fucking 

9035
06:41:20,691 --> 06:41:21,530
game.
I'm gonna text him,

9036
06:41:21,531 --> 06:41:26,531
Yo baby,
you're going to be seeing a lot of these

9037
06:41:27,441 --> 06:41:28,480
throughout the whole game.
I mean,

9038
06:41:28,481 --> 06:41:30,230
I really wish we were playing this right
now.

9039
06:41:30,231 --> 06:41:33,970
Like it's so much fun announcement.

9040
06:41:35,090 --> 06:41:36,440
Go ahead.
Breaking announcement.

9041
06:41:36,860 --> 06:41:38,480
I just wanted to show you,

9042
06:41:39,020 --> 06:41:40,100
Oh,

it's great cause you paid 500 bucks.

9053
06:42:15,221 --> 06:42:16,240
You earned it.
Yeah.

9054
06:42:16,440 --> 06:42:18,700
Do we put that as a,
as a goal I guess?

9055
06:42:18,701 --> 06:42:20,200
Or if you donate five,
just say,

9056
06:42:20,201 --> 06:42:21,520
but we'll put it on the,
as a goal.

9057
06:42:21,580 --> 06:42:23,200
500.
Give us a call.

9058
06:42:23,350 --> 06:42:27,490
Get us to our dream of making poor joey.
He's on this call right now.

9059
06:42:27,491 --> 06:42:29,500
He's going to have to come back in and,
but if you,

9060
06:42:29,501 --> 06:42:31,210
do you want a limit on how many calls?

9061
06:42:31,630 --> 06:42:32,970
No,
I mean people are $500.

9062
06:42:33,510 --> 06:42:34,470
There should be no,

9065
06:42:39,341 --> 06:42:40,810
If they fucking brain gum.
Yeah.

9066
06:42:40,811 --> 06:42:42,800
We're not obligated to talk to them if 
they suck.

9067
06:42:43,020 --> 06:42:43,853
But before we do it,
can you just finish this part because 

9068
06:42:46,061 --> 06:42:48,850
this feels like how the game works and I
really,

9069
06:42:48,851 --> 06:42:50,870
I'm excited because like the,

9074
06:43:05,540 --> 06:43:10,540
Look at the thumbnail from this video

9075
06:43:13,971 --> 06:43:14,421
dude.
Yeah.

9076
06:43:14,421 --> 06:43:16,640
That's 100% of poison video.
Dan,

9077
06:43:16,641 --> 06:43:19,490
I'm going to forward this to you.
I wonder if we can edit in it.

9078
06:43:19,580 --> 06:43:21,090
Well,
I guess it's just a livestream.

9079
06:43:21,480 --> 06:43:21,921
Well,
here,

9080
06:43:21,921 --> 06:43:25,730
let's hear what he has to say.
Here we go.

9081
06:43:27,200 --> 06:43:28,033
Can you hear this?

9082
06:43:30,880 --> 06:43:31,713
I'm trying to throw up.
It won't come out of my stomach is like 

9083
06:43:34,541 --> 06:43:38,770
swollen,
like a big bubble in my stomach.

9084
06:43:38,771 --> 06:43:40,050
So I be tired.

9085
06:43:41,160 --> 06:43:43,080
He's a toning for his sins.
Guys.

9086
06:43:43,380 --> 06:43:44,213
You know what?
Why don't I send this to you Dan and 

9087
06:43:46,080 --> 06:43:48,240
maybe you can throw it up on the screen 
on the,

9088
06:43:48,250 --> 06:43:49,083
like he said the were dying and there,
should we send somebody to check it out 

9089
06:43:51,850 --> 06:43:52,710
now you know he's,
he's,

9090
06:43:52,760 --> 06:43:55,160
he's hamming it up.
He loves the camera.

9091
06:43:56,000 --> 06:43:58,140
I don't doubt that he's in pain,
but like,

9092
06:43:58,170 --> 06:43:59,450
yeah,
he's not dying.

9093
06:43:59,451 --> 06:44:00,560
He's fat here.
I'm going to,

9094
06:44:00,780 --> 06:44:02,790
he wouldn't be here if it wasn't like,
you know what?

9095
06:44:02,791 --> 06:44:05,310
I got to atone for my fucking horrible 
prank sin.

9096
06:44:06,150 --> 06:44:07,600
Hold on.
I'm going to email this to me.

9097
06:44:07,620 --> 06:44:08,940
Why is it just,
what the fuck?

9098
06:44:09,870 --> 06:44:12,600
It won't let me email this fucking cup 
video or listen,

9099
06:44:13,110 --> 06:44:13,943
is Aussie ready with the next song?
Cause like I want to hear another 

9100
06:44:15,751 --> 06:44:16,730
fucking song.
I don't know.

9101
06:44:16,980 --> 06:44:19,170
I'm emailing this to myself and I'm 
going to pull it up.

9102
06:44:19,171 --> 06:44:21,160
So we go on joy.
Um,

9103
06:44:23,090 --> 06:44:26,380
US says we're at 85,
85.

9104
06:44:27,930 --> 06:44:31,580
Oh my God.
We are really close to 85 this God.

9105
06:44:33,870 --> 06:44:36,700
Noah's Ark says don't fucking quit.
All right.

9106
06:44:36,980 --> 06:44:38,500
All right.
Do we need dinner?

9107
06:44:38,510 --> 06:44:42,480
Is anyone hungry?
Ethan?

9108
06:44:42,481 --> 06:44:44,280
Actually,
I need to,

9109
06:44:45,240 --> 06:44:46,073
I need to actually cut our record for so
long and just restart it to ensure that 

9110
06:44:50,251 --> 06:44:51,720
we don't lose our footage.
So,

9111
06:44:51,750 --> 06:44:54,360
but the stream won't go down the stream.
Just the record.

9112
06:44:54,361 --> 06:44:57,000
So we're just going to stop recording 
right now for just a brief moment.

9113
06:44:57,630 --> 06:44:58,463
Standby guys,
we are here to fucking help the fucking 

9114
06:45:04,981 --> 06:45:05,814
California burn people.
Please help us help the California burn 

9115
06:45:10,681 --> 06:45:12,330
people.
Got a dark world.

9116
06:45:12,331 --> 06:45:13,590
We need the need to pick it up.
Oh,

9117
06:45:13,600 --> 06:45:14,670
by the way,
next year.

9118
06:45:14,671 --> 06:45:16,950
It could be your house,
your town,

9119
06:45:17,310 --> 06:45:20,160
it next year.
It could be your home and you don't know

9120
06:45:20,161 --> 06:45:22,050
what it is.
You could have been a fucking weird,

9121
06:45:22,510 --> 06:45:26,960
a water balloon,
a giant water hits your town.

9122
06:45:27,000 --> 06:45:28,710
Super Likely.
But anything's possible.

9123
06:45:28,730 --> 06:45:30,570
No,
and we're here every year.

9124
06:45:30,571 --> 06:45:35,571
We do this every fucking,
all right,

9125
06:45:36,211 --> 06:45:37,044
I've got joey salads like Ethan stand 
tall and strong and we're going to beg 

9126
06:45:42,960 --> 06:45:45,450
for your pennies and peanuts

9127
06:45:48,990 --> 06:45:52,340
trying to throw up.
It won't come out and my stomach is like

9128
06:45:52,350 --> 06:45:53,183
swollen

9129
06:45:56,090 --> 06:46:01,090
that angle almost look and all this shit
all over him,

9130
06:46:01,970 --> 06:46:02,803
man.
I've never seen a man broken like 

9131
06:46:04,280 --> 06:46:07,430
picture him after this stream walking 
out onto the street.

9132
06:46:07,940 --> 06:46:10,760
Like what do people think is going on in
this guy's life?

9133
06:46:10,790 --> 06:46:12,780
I'm s I'm crossing the road.
Yeah,

9134
06:46:12,830 --> 06:46:13,940
yeah,
absolutely.

9135
06:46:14,000 --> 06:46:15,920
Let's watch this one more time.
Oh my God bless.

9136
06:46:15,921 --> 06:46:18,560
You can watch it without sound and just 
enjoy.

9137
06:46:19,960 --> 06:46:22,010
You got to love the guy.
You got to appreciate him.

9138
06:46:22,011 --> 06:46:27,011
He flew out.
You know he's here hustling.

9139
06:46:29,930 --> 06:46:32,210
He's gonna eat another one.
Do we really want that?

9140
06:46:32,730 --> 06:46:35,100
I mean,
we want that hundred thousand so I guess

9141
06:46:35,101 --> 06:46:38,850
we do want it right guys.
Guys,

9142
06:46:39,090 --> 06:46:42,270
this is all part of helping people 
going.

9143
06:46:42,690 --> 06:46:45,470
I don't know.
I don't know.

9144
06:46:45,570 --> 06:46:48,570
We still have 50,000
he's try to hit that wall a little bit.

9145
06:46:48,610 --> 06:46:50,580
Starting to hit that wall.
Justin,

9146
06:46:50,880 --> 06:46:52,230
Justin,
we need another need,

9147
06:46:52,231 --> 06:46:55,440
another speech.
Justin that's been hitting that wall all

9148
06:46:55,440 --> 06:46:56,730
night.
I'm not going to accept it.

9149
06:46:56,880 --> 06:46:58,830
We're going to keep going and we're 
going to fucking do it.

9150
06:46:58,831 --> 06:47:00,060
Right?
Look at this drawing,

9151
06:47:00,061 --> 06:47:03,210
that fucking Hershey's she's working on.
I get a drawing to work on I.

9152
06:47:03,211 --> 06:47:04,110
We are going.
All right.

9153
06:47:04,111 --> 06:47:05,690
We're going to send it.
I'll tell you what,

9154
06:47:07,570 --> 06:47:12,570
you can leave Ethan.
I think Justin has hit a wall.

9155
06:47:19,680 --> 06:47:23,250
We should have Aussie and then let's do 
another prank call for Christ's sake.

9156
06:47:23,310 --> 06:47:26,210
We just got to keep things rolling.
You're not leading it.

9157
06:47:26,370 --> 06:47:28,290
I'm Justin.
I,

9158
06:47:28,291 --> 06:47:30,390
you know,
I'm feeling the vibe I'm getting.

9159
06:47:30,391 --> 06:47:31,224
You know

9160
06:47:31,670 --> 06:47:33,620
Jesus.
That was like really too much.

9161
06:47:33,621 --> 06:47:38,621
He just somebody saying your flies down.
What somebody's saying.

9162
06:47:40,640 --> 06:47:42,770
Oh it is totally fine.
It's totally now.

9163
06:47:42,771 --> 06:47:44,000
By the way,
on purpose.

9164
06:47:44,001 --> 06:47:44,834
On purpose.
It's on purpose down and if you get a 

9165
06:47:47,091 --> 06:47:48,830
sneak peak,
you get a pq peak.

9166
06:47:50,900 --> 06:47:53,010
Oh wait.
There was a $500 riding requests.

9167
06:47:53,370 --> 06:47:55,900
Oh,
someone monitoring those.

9168
06:47:57,260 --> 06:47:59,620
What is it?
Oh there,

9169
06:47:59,621 --> 06:48:03,350
it means it's somebody just said like 
don't ignore it or whatever.

9170
06:48:05,030 --> 06:48:09,110
Love you too James though.
Thank you Stephanie.

9171
06:48:09,111 --> 06:48:09,910
Thank you.
Tinkled bird.

9172
06:48:09,910 --> 06:48:11,720
Thank you.
G off regular.

9173
06:48:12,030 --> 06:48:12,863
Ooh Gee off.
Says intense gastrointestinal pressure 

9174
06:48:16,641 --> 06:48:18,350
can cause a rupture,
which is a medical emergency.

9175
06:48:18,351 --> 06:48:20,480
Pay attention to Joey's responses.
Thank you.

9176
06:48:20,490 --> 06:48:21,323
Thank you,
Jeff.

9177
06:48:21,350 --> 06:48:22,183
Thank you.

9178
06:48:22,470 --> 06:48:24,450
Yeah,
good thousand please.

9179
06:48:24,451 --> 06:48:27,540
Next pepper.
That's what Justin says.

9180
06:48:27,570 --> 06:48:32,220
No,
I say we care about Joey and Justin next

9181
06:48:32,221 --> 06:48:33,480
pepper.
Well,

9182
06:48:33,481 --> 06:48:34,800
no,
ha ha ha.

9183
06:48:35,110 --> 06:48:35,943
Raise a hundred grand so we can give 
joey another pepper with medical 

9184
06:48:40,031 --> 06:48:40,864
supervision.

9185
06:48:41,740 --> 06:48:43,160
We've got better.
Be careful

9186
06:48:43,630 --> 06:48:46,000
who here is the medical supervision,
by the way.

9187
06:48:46,910 --> 06:48:48,090
Hey listen.
Look,

9188
06:48:48,130 --> 06:48:48,963
I didn't fucking organize this thing.
You're pretty up and he ain't no 

9189
06:48:52,700 --> 06:48:55,150
stopping to the stream.
Hoppity thank you.

9190
06:48:55,300 --> 06:48:56,620
Thank you.
Colby Mitchell.

9191
06:48:57,120 --> 06:48:58,360
Yo,
I'm on these coast.

9192
06:48:58,361 --> 06:49:00,590
Keep me up til two please.
You?

9193
06:49:00,610 --> 06:49:01,930
Yes,
of course you can.

9194
06:49:02,090 --> 06:49:02,923
Yeah.

9195
06:49:05,760 --> 06:49:06,900
Betty McKay.
Maddie says,

9196
06:49:06,901 --> 06:49:10,470
this is my last $5 from my pappy.
Thank you.

9197
06:49:13,470 --> 06:49:15,540
Someone keeps saying Justin ride the 
skateboard.

9198
06:49:15,541 --> 06:49:16,830
Yeah.
You saw what Justin just tried to,

9199
06:49:16,890 --> 06:49:18,540
when he tried to hold the Skateboard,
right?

9200
06:49:18,541 --> 06:49:20,480
He,
he almost broke the entire ustream.

9201
06:49:20,700 --> 06:49:23,280
Maybe you shouldn't write it in here.
All right.

9202
06:49:23,281 --> 06:49:25,830
Here we crossed 85,000
whoa.

9203
06:49:25,831 --> 06:49:26,190
We're getting

9204
06:49:26,190 --> 06:49:28,980
a surge.
You guys were getting a surge.

9205
06:49:29,530 --> 06:49:30,363
We're getting a surge.
Somebody saying the face drawing isn't 

9206
06:49:32,880 --> 06:49:34,800
open right now.
Oh again.

9207
06:49:34,920 --> 06:49:35,960
Oh yeah,
no it does.

9208
06:49:36,000 --> 06:49:37,930
I'm just saying what that guy said.
Joe,

9209
06:49:37,931 --> 06:49:38,641
how are you feeling?
Oh,

9210
06:49:38,641 --> 06:49:40,980
Joey's back.
How you feeling buddy?

9211
06:49:41,370 --> 06:49:43,860
Joey turned the mic towards you and tell
us all about yourself.

9212
06:49:45,060 --> 06:49:49,940
You want to know everything about me?
Let me talk to joey.

9213
06:49:49,941 --> 06:49:50,560
Joe,
you want to know?

9214
06:49:50,560 --> 06:49:52,440
You want to know that you're okay?
Are you?

9215
06:49:52,500 --> 06:49:53,490
Yes sir.
No ma'am.

9216
06:49:53,550 --> 06:49:56,130
I'm good.
Did you always sell a drawing is not up.

9217
06:49:56,160 --> 06:49:56,993
Uh,
Dan,

9218
06:49:57,720 --> 06:50:01,920
of course it's fine.
We should all prior joey salad drawing.

9219
06:50:02,250 --> 06:50:03,083
You and I should draw Joey Salad drawing
so that we could add more money to the 

9220
06:50:07,681 --> 06:50:09,420
money bucket.
Come on people.

9221
06:50:10,170 --> 06:50:11,030
What are we doing?
We're,

9222
06:50:11,040 --> 06:50:15,810
we're all living in a fuck it shit hole.
We're trying to say.

9223
06:50:15,840 --> 06:50:16,501
Hold on,
hold on.

9224
06:50:16,501 --> 06:50:17,334
Hold on.
Justin.

9225
06:50:17,510 --> 06:50:18,930
Sorry Joey,
tell me,

9226
06:50:18,931 --> 06:50:20,390
how are you feeling dude?
It,

9227
06:50:20,460 --> 06:50:25,460
my mouth is 100% fine.
That dissipated in like five minutes.

9228
06:50:26,051 --> 06:50:27,250
So that's good news.
Yeah,

9229
06:50:27,300 --> 06:50:30,250
but it's this,
does it feel,

9230
06:50:30,270 --> 06:50:35,270
it feels like someone's stabbing me in 
with what are you doing skateboard?

9231
06:50:36,901 --> 06:50:37,734
It's is important.
Where he ended up like we're having an 

9232
06:50:39,541 --> 06:50:41,250
important conversation with,
oh,

9233
06:50:41,430 --> 06:50:42,270
by the way,
when you,

9234
06:50:42,271 --> 06:50:45,480
when you put a grip tape on,
you cut off the excess.

9235
06:50:45,481 --> 06:50:49,020
You got to sing in that puppy down.
Justin,

9236
06:50:49,740 --> 06:50:50,573
hang on one sec.
We're literally trying to find out if 

9237
06:50:51,721 --> 06:50:53,520
this man is dying.
It just as like,

9238
06:50:53,521 --> 06:50:55,130
what about my skateboard?
No,

9239
06:50:55,140 --> 06:50:56,700
that was getting picked up and I'll 
wait.

9240
06:50:56,701 --> 06:50:57,534
Go for it.
I didn't know that was getting picked 

9241
06:50:59,161 --> 06:50:59,994
up.

9242
06:51:02,110 --> 06:51:07,110
Dan.
A face tat is not up and then it's super

9243
06:51:07,741 --> 06:51:09,510
quiet after that.
By the way,

9244
06:51:09,511 --> 06:51:12,300
this skateboard we're all going to write
on and uh,

9245
06:51:12,301 --> 06:51:17,301
this is gonna be a big Joey skateboard 
situation.

9246
06:51:17,730 --> 06:51:18,680
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

9247
06:51:18,890 --> 06:51:21,060
All right.
All right.

9248
06:51:21,990 --> 06:51:24,390
Good luck.
Go in and talk to them.

9249
06:51:24,890 --> 06:51:28,290
Just say you or out of fucking control.
Please talk to him.

9250
06:51:28,291 --> 06:51:30,240
Not getting stronger.
The like the later,

9251
06:51:30,241 --> 06:51:34,020
this goes,
just as like gaining power rising.

9252
06:51:34,021 --> 06:51:38,460
As I get more passionate about it,
like as we get more exhausted,

9253
06:51:38,490 --> 06:51:41,190
he starts to radiate super thing in 
lunatic energy.

9254
06:51:41,640 --> 06:51:42,473
Look,
Bam.

9255
06:51:42,690 --> 06:51:44,280
Done.
Look at that.

9256
06:51:44,310 --> 06:51:46,440
Look at this.
Look at this fucking shit.

9257
06:51:46,710 --> 06:51:48,630
It's a rip.
It's up right now.

9258
06:51:49,710 --> 06:51:54,710
It's a rip and dip fucking grip tape 
with a brand new primitive,

9259
06:51:55,340 --> 06:51:56,173
uh,
rick deck with bill foil moisture 

9260
06:52:00,180 --> 06:52:02,770
magician.
Why does this keep crashed?

9261
06:52:02,771 --> 06:52:05,730
His name waste and then,
and then we're all going to draw on it.

9262
06:52:06,060 --> 06:52:06,893
So,
and then I'm going to put a bunch of 

9263
06:52:08,161 --> 06:52:09,510
wheels,
trucks and wheels on it.

9264
06:52:09,540 --> 06:52:10,373
Okay.
So,

9265
06:52:11,070 --> 06:52:12,300
oh,
we are surging.

9266
06:52:12,301 --> 06:52:14,370
We're almost to 86.
Hello.

9267
06:52:15,440 --> 06:52:16,740
Hello?
She said that,

9268
06:52:16,741 --> 06:52:20,130
uh,
she feels like the little alien in the,

9269
06:52:20,580 --> 06:52:24,160
in the cat's stomach is what's going on 
and in and joey

9270
06:52:24,160 --> 06:52:24,993
stomach,
right.

9271
06:52:25,720 --> 06:52:27,580
Like are really good.
So we weren't.

9272
06:52:27,610 --> 06:52:28,720
So Joey,
tell me,

9273
06:52:28,721 --> 06:52:29,770
first of all,
you said you're,

9274
06:52:30,130 --> 06:52:32,890
the pain in your mouth has gone quickly 
after the pepper,

9275
06:52:32,891 --> 06:52:33,724
but we're,
so what is happening in your body right 

9276
06:52:34,721 --> 06:52:38,320
now?
My stomach is not able to handle it.

9277
06:52:38,560 --> 06:52:41,410
And did you have a diarrhea?
It wasn't diarrhea.

9278
06:52:41,411 --> 06:52:43,930
I don't think it's sitting.
I don't think it went through my system.

9279
06:52:44,170 --> 06:52:46,630
You didn't know it was fly or not 
pooped,

9280
06:52:46,631 --> 06:52:49,990
but like it wasn't spicy.
I think once it gets old digested,

9281
06:52:50,230 --> 06:52:51,700
that's when my ass just going to 
explode.

9282
06:52:52,000 --> 06:52:55,020
You didn't have a spicy pope,
just a normal pole.

9283
06:52:55,021 --> 06:52:57,100
It was like a normal,
he was a fly hurry.

9284
06:52:57,370 --> 06:52:58,930
And Are you,
is your stomach and pain?

9285
06:52:58,931 --> 06:53:01,180
Are you feeling better?
Are you afraid of 100,000

9286
06:53:01,220 --> 06:53:04,960
it's like 70% I am afraid of 100,000
but like if I have to do it again,

9287
06:53:04,990 --> 06:53:06,370
I have to do it.
Good question.

9288
06:53:06,910 --> 06:53:08,830
Oh sorry.
Please go ahead.

9289
06:53:09,010 --> 06:53:10,720
Well,
Justin says you have to do it.

9290
06:53:10,960 --> 06:53:13,390
He's been wasted.
You don't have to do anything,

9291
06:53:13,720 --> 06:53:18,190
but what we have to do is get to 
$100,000

9292
06:53:19,940 --> 06:53:21,520
pool.
How many people are watching right now?

9293
06:53:23,860 --> 06:53:24,581
Yeah,
that's right.

9294
06:53:24,581 --> 06:53:27,660
Because we're getting fucked up because 
we're getting excited,

9295
06:53:28,040 --> 06:53:33,040
excited.
It gives $1 with hell scape.

9296
06:53:35,700 --> 06:53:37,930
So here's what we're going to do.
Aussies going to play.

9297
06:53:38,050 --> 06:53:40,330
We're going to print out their psychic 
call.

9298
06:53:40,960 --> 06:53:44,110
We're going to do another cycle call,
continue to build the skateboards.

9299
06:53:44,111 --> 06:53:46,690
So we're going to put away,

I do not want to make Dan.
If it mcnugget even comes close to me,

I will fucking have a panic attack.
You've got to get justin doughnut place.

9306
06:54:13,910 --> 06:54:16,390
You or we don't all agree we're donating

9307
06:54:16,960 --> 06:54:20,110

Yep.
Okay.

06:56:23,590 --> 06:56:24,423
All right.

9350
06:56:30,130 --> 06:56:32,210
Free one is completely different.
Yeah,

06:56:33,900 --> 06:56:34,733
correct.

9352

She came from Greece.
She studied sculpture at St Martins.

9353
06:56:56,040 --> 06:56:56,873
Good.

9354
06:56:58,800 --> 06:56:59,633
Oh,

I sit in that case ramen and then 30 

9356
06:57:16,800 --> 06:57:21,800
seconds I want to do sleep with people 
like you to see what I can do.

9357
06:57:45,550 --> 06:57:50,550
I took it to a supermarket.
I don't know why I had status,

9358
06:57:54,460 --> 06:57:59,460
so it started then I said,
but you've got no money.

9359
06:58:01,750 --> 06:58:05,360
She laughed and say yes.
The funny I said,

9360
06:58:07,750 --> 06:58:12,750
I can't see anyone a smiling and here 
are you sure you got I want to sleep.

9361
06:58:25,720 --> 06:58:30,720
I'm asleep with common people that thank

9365
06:59:42,951 --> 06:59:47,951
while you did that,
we crossed into 91 close to 100,000

9366
06:59:49,161 --> 06:59:50,720
I didn't think we were going to make 
food.

9367
06:59:50,750 --> 06:59:53,900
I thought it was impossible.
We were right there yet,

9368
06:59:53,901 --> 06:59:57,050
but we're getting close so we're almost 
at 91 dude,

9373
07:00:06,471 --> 07:00:10,130

It does not stop.

9374
07:00:10,160 --> 07:00:12,140
Hold on.
Can we see how much he's donated?

9375
07:00:12,141 --> 07:00:12,974
Yeah,
I'm curious.

9376
07:00:13,940 --> 07:00:14,773
I'm curious,
how long have you seen it and they're 

9377
07:00:16,491 --> 07:00:19,510
getting more aggressive.
You kiss me.

There's so many amazing donations 
happening right now.

9405

07:01:27,250 --> 07:01:29,480
Oh,

9409
07:01:29,560 --> 07:01:30,393

Okay.

9414
07:01:36,850 --> 07:01:37,900
They're going to be all right.

9415
07:01:37,901 --> 07:01:39,670
We're again close.
There's not gonna be that much longer.

9416
07:01:39,671 --> 07:01:44,280

Hold on guys.

9421
07:01:52,871 --> 07:01:56,860

amazing musician can check her out.

07:02:02,621 --> 07:02:03,131
Okay.

That was your idea.

9438
07:02:33,550 --> 07:02:34,720
That was the one you asked me to do.
I just,

9439
07:02:35,110 --> 07:02:37,470

9443
07:02:48,611 --> 07:02:50,440

He just emailed me.

9444
07:02:50,441 --> 07:02:51,190

That dude a lot.
Yeah.

9447
07:02:58,060 --> 07:02:59,380
Wow.
I'd have to crunch the numbers.

9448
07:02:59,381 --> 07:03:01,300
Well we'll have a,
we're doing,

9449
07:03:01,301 --> 07:03:03,490
like Ethan said,
we're doing like a report this Friday.

9450
07:03:04,600 --> 07:03:06,250
Took over everything and uh,

9451
07:03:06,251 --> 07:03:07,084
we'll,
we'll definitely shout out all these 

9452
07:03:07,901 --> 07:03:11,260
awesome donations up dog.
She changed her name to up dog.

9453
07:03:11,261 --> 07:03:13,990
I'm a girl asshole because I kept 
guessing the gender.

9454
07:03:13,991 --> 07:03:14,824
Ron Up dog wants to hurry up.
You are so thirsty for these two thick 

9455
07:03:19,001 --> 07:03:19,834
boys to lock list.
I never had someone donated in total up 

9456
07:03:23,651 --> 07:03:24,040
dog.

9457
07:03:24,040 --> 07:03:25,900
I think it's amazing.
We're pretty impressed.

9458
07:03:25,960 --> 07:03:28,840
You guys are crushing it.
You guys are fucking crushing it.

9459
07:03:28,841 --> 07:03:30,990
We're almost a 94,000
this is incredible.

9460
07:03:31,000 --> 07:03:33,070
This is a,
this is a holiday miracle right there.

9461
07:03:33,071 --> 07:03:34,870
I'm rallying right now.
Awesome.

9462
07:03:35,080 --> 07:03:39,040
I didn't think we were going to make it.
You guys are fucking Joey.

9463
07:03:39,041 --> 07:03:40,840
How do you feel seeing these numbers 
right?

9464
07:03:40,841 --> 07:03:45,841
I'm excited but scared at the same time.
Every time I see a big donation I'm like

9465
07:03:47,680 --> 07:03:51,160
now Dan is legitimately worried.
He keeps taking me aside and being like,

9466
07:03:51,580 --> 07:03:53,950
I don't know if we should make them.
I'm worried for myself as well.

9467
07:03:53,951 --> 07:03:58,320
My stomach still gargling and it's like 
my God,

9468
07:03:58,540 --> 07:04:01,110
I can't not do it.
I don't want to,

9469
07:04:01,210 --> 07:04:03,520
I don't want him.
I don't want a medical emergency.

9470
07:04:03,521 --> 07:04:04,480
On our hands.
Well,

9471
07:04:04,481 --> 07:04:08,350
maybe make him eat the whole thing.
Just half of the whole thing.

9472
07:04:09,690 --> 07:04:11,040
So just take a bite.
I'm not even,

9473
07:04:11,050 --> 07:04:14,020
I wasn't even screaming before when I,
when I felt like I was on a pest out,

9474
07:04:14,110 --> 07:04:14,570
like,
oh,

9475
07:04:14,570 --> 07:04:15,830
I didn't think so.
Yeah.

9476
07:04:16,070 --> 07:04:19,760
So what we're going to do joey,
and you don't have to commit to this.

9477
07:04:19,761 --> 07:04:20,594
Okay.
Um,

9478
07:04:21,740 --> 07:04:23,090
first of all,
we have to,

9479
07:04:23,750 --> 07:04:25,930
there's two Carolina reapers.
Which one looked?

9480
07:04:25,940 --> 07:04:29,120
This one kind of looks less scary to me.
This one looks like more lame,

9481
07:04:29,540 --> 07:04:31,400
but you can decide which bag do you want
to hit up?

9482
07:04:34,110 --> 07:04:34,943
Let's wait for Justin.
It's before we take the call and media 

9483
07:04:36,871 --> 07:04:39,750
to eat.
So you think you think those ones,

9484
07:04:40,020 --> 07:04:43,010
I mean they probably does it really,
I don't know.

9485
07:04:43,020 --> 07:04:43,853
You decide,
you pick your poison as they say and 

9486
07:04:45,200 --> 07:04:46,290
literally,
yeah.

9487
07:04:46,890 --> 07:04:47,723
But would you still rather get pepper 
sprayed or would you rather do the 

9488
07:04:49,891 --> 07:04:50,860
question?
Yeah,

9489
07:04:52,590 --> 07:04:53,423
yeah.
I think I'll be good if we just take a 

9490
07:04:54,991 --> 07:04:55,920
bite out of it.
So here,

9491
07:04:55,921 --> 07:04:57,930
let's see.
I'm going to pick one out for you.

9492
07:04:57,990 --> 07:04:58,823
A small one.

9493
07:04:59,070 --> 07:04:59,903
Okay.

9494
07:05:01,960 --> 07:05:03,880
It's crazy.
Yeah,

9495
07:05:04,970 --> 07:05:07,200
I'm going to have to at least need a 
real small one minute.

9496
07:05:09,140 --> 07:05:10,040
What do you think?
That's still,

9497
07:05:10,041 --> 07:05:10,874
I mean,
I'm reading up on this pepper right now 

9498
07:05:12,790 --> 07:05:13,623
and uh,
there's like multiple farmers being 

9499
07:05:15,831 --> 07:05:16,491
like,
Oh God,

9500
07:05:16,491 --> 07:05:17,324
no,
you would never put the thing in your 

9501
07:05:17,721 --> 07:05:18,890
mouth.
Well,

9502
07:05:18,891 --> 07:05:21,200
you put a little bit in it for cooking.
You know what I'm saying?

9503
07:05:21,230 --> 07:05:21,891
Like,
well,

9504
07:05:21,891 --> 07:05:22,850
people do.
It is,

9505
07:05:22,851 --> 07:05:24,740
it is something people do for a 
challenge.

9506
07:05:24,741 --> 07:05:25,550
Okay.
All right.

9507
07:05:25,550 --> 07:05:28,720
Like retinal link have done it.
I've written linky they were fine,

9508
07:05:29,780 --> 07:05:31,430
fine as a,
you know,

9509
07:05:32,150 --> 07:05:33,710
subjective,
but they survived.

9510
07:05:34,790 --> 07:05:36,590
God,
that smells so strong.

9511
07:05:36,591 --> 07:05:37,490
Dude.
Smell that.

9512
07:05:38,240 --> 07:05:41,090
That's a Carolina reaper.
Well,

9513
07:05:41,120 --> 07:05:42,080

you know,

9514
07:05:42,380 --> 07:05:45,470

9515

07:05:46,911 --> 07:05:47,744

9517
07:05:48,120 --> 07:05:48,953
Okay.

9518

send,
sent shivers down your spine.

9520
07:05:52,240 --> 07:05:56,970
I think I saw somebody fake eating a 
online and it was like,

9521
07:05:57,630 --> 07:05:59,130
I'm sure there's a lot of people faking 
it.

9522
07:05:59,190 --> 07:05:59,860
So,

$1,700.

9538
07:06:47,860 --> 07:06:49,300
Thank you man.
That's very generous

9539
07:06:49,570 --> 07:06:53,020
member.
These are all tax deductible donations,

9540
07:06:53,040 --> 07:06:55,450
which does help a lot at the end of the 
year.

9541
07:06:57,370 --> 07:06:58,203
That's my boy.

9542
07:06:59,250 --> 07:07:01,140
Well the thing is when you make a 
donation,

9543
07:07:01,141 --> 07:07:02,030
charitable donation,

9544
07:07:02,370 --> 07:07:03,203
you pretty much depending on your tax

9569
07:08:04,120 --> 07:08:05,590
Can I wash this without getting claimed?

9570
07:08:07,580 --> 07:08:09,200
I'm curious.
If you watch this,

07:08:09,201 --> 07:08:11,600
I will.
White List your channels like right now.

07:08:12,190 --> 07:08:13,720
Wait,
so you could so wait.

9573
07:08:13,750 --> 07:08:16,510
You would auto claim it if it,
that's this.

9574
07:08:16,810 --> 07:08:18,070
I'm not gonna.
I don't wanna deal with that.

9575
07:08:19,140 --> 07:08:19,960
I don't care.

I'm just seemed a little reluctant.

9604
07:09:25,510 --> 07:09:28,170
She owes us a song,
I think less worried about the dogs.

9605
07:09:28,210 --> 07:09:31,960
This a fucking anonymous for the $250.
By the way.

9606
07:09:32,110 --> 07:09:33,580
I'll say that it's,
well,

9607
07:09:33,840 --> 07:09:34,673
he doesn't play the song she owes us 
then she's letting down every single 

9608
07:09:39,641 --> 07:09:43,720
fire victims of California.
She's done a lot of brush.

9609
07:09:43,730 --> 07:09:46,090
She's done a lot for us.
We appreciate her.

9610

9618
07:10:10,531 --> 07:10:13,780
We can we get one more song from Aussie?
One more song.

9619
07:10:14,540 --> 07:10:19,540
Why the one song that I pick?
God dammit.

9620
07:10:20,860 --> 07:10:21,400
So,

9621
07:10:21,400 --> 07:10:23,770

9622
07:10:23,771 --> 07:10:27,910
Here's what we decided with Joey.
We've got this too by the way.

9623
07:10:28,320 --> 07:10:29,650
Went to a good cause.
Okay.

9624
07:10:29,710 --> 07:10:30,251
I know,
I know,

9625
07:10:30,251 --> 07:10:31,940
I know.
I feel like,

9626
07:10:32,140 --> 07:10:33,500
I feel like,
I feel like a,

9627
07:10:33,501 --> 07:10:35,510
a fan.
Like,

9628
07:10:35,520 --> 07:10:36,140
Hey,
I,

9629
07:10:36,140 --> 07:10:36,973
I paid for Justin and,
and just want to see Ethan shake that 

9630
07:10:40,380 --> 07:10:41,840
make out.
And it didn't happen.

9631
07:10:42,110 --> 07:10:43,970
Just Justin,
Jesse Var,

9632
07:10:44,020 --> 07:10:47,660
everyone's decided that they want you to
eat the pepper instead of fucking shit.

9633
07:10:49,030 --> 07:10:51,530
So Justin were talking about,
uh,

9634
07:10:51,550 --> 07:10:54,160
what Joey's going to eat now.
Here's the smallest one.

9635
07:10:54,161 --> 07:10:57,070
We can find it.
Are you going to nibble kind of the tip?

9636
07:10:57,071 --> 07:10:59,430
Like what are you comfortable with?
Just the tip.

9637
07:11:00,030 --> 07:11:02,540
Just the tip or are we talking about 
guys?

9638
07:11:02,720 --> 07:11:04,000
We can,
we can just cut the tip off.

9639
07:11:04,600 --> 07:11:09,010
I feel you eat the tip or the stem.
I mean this shaft.

9640
07:11:09,090 --> 07:11:14,090
I mean like the head of the penis.
Which part do you want to head?

9641
07:11:17,260 --> 07:11:20,740
Half of it off.
Let me see it.

9642
07:11:21,580 --> 07:11:22,110
Yeah,
I know.

9643
07:11:22,110 --> 07:11:22,943

9644
07:11:23,140 --> 07:11:23,973

[inaudible] heard that call.

9646
07:11:26,540 --> 07:11:27,373
We'll just rip it off.
I'm a very quiet person in the 

9647
07:11:29,081 --> 07:11:30,450
background.
Usually killing it.

9648
07:11:30,670 --> 07:11:31,503
We might have to like cut it off.
Glad on your part of this part of the 

9649
07:11:34,251 --> 07:11:35,800
straight.
You can pay when a troll bro.

9650
07:11:35,801 --> 07:11:38,220
Yeah,
make a song about it.

9651
07:11:38,990 --> 07:11:40,360
There's a university.
Joey,

9652
07:11:40,870 --> 07:11:44,680
why?
Cause I want to know what he's doing all

9653
07:11:44,681 --> 07:11:49,681
in music for taking the safe as you're 
so close.

9654
07:11:51,030 --> 07:11:52,930
So close.
Here's what I'm going to do.

9655
07:11:52,931 --> 07:11:54,700
Finally escape.
Look at this.

9656
07:11:54,701 --> 07:11:56,380
It looks like that one's nasty.
Look,

9657
07:11:56,440 --> 07:12:01,440
I'm going to lick it.
You're going to lick it nuts like get to

9658
07:12:01,951 --> 07:12:03,010
100,000
no,

9659
07:12:03,011 --> 07:12:05,380
I want it.
Know what I want to in consolidate,

9660
07:12:05,740 --> 07:12:09,940
consolidate,
consolidate and consolidate.

9661
07:12:10,030 --> 07:12:12,460
Consolidate.
By the way,

9662
07:12:12,940 --> 07:12:13,773
by the way,
we've been going for seven and a half 

9663
07:12:14,920 --> 07:12:16,840
hours.
My charitable motherfucker.

9664
07:12:18,190 --> 07:12:19,023
It feels like 20 hours.
There's a lot of charitable energy in 

9665
07:12:21,281 --> 07:12:22,114
this room,
so when are you going to like black 

9666
07:12:23,091 --> 07:12:23,924
pepper?
This is why I think Aussie needs to 

9667
07:12:25,571 --> 07:12:29,650
learn the last song and I think because 
here's what's going to happen.

9668
07:12:29,830 --> 07:12:30,663
We're going to hit a hundred and joy's 
can have to use that last pepper and we 

9669
07:12:34,601 --> 07:12:36,370
need it.
We need a beautiful song.

9670
07:12:37,340 --> 07:12:39,860
Yeah.
I mean you're not arguing with us.

9671
07:12:39,890 --> 07:12:41,380
We're not in charge of what have herb or
not.

9672
07:12:41,381 --> 07:12:43,910
That's up to her man.
Have her play as we do the outro.

9673
07:12:44,890 --> 07:12:45,723
I'm going to lick this fucking pepper.
Y'All want to do that or I want to see 

9674
07:12:48,011 --> 07:12:49,420
it now.
I don't want us,

9675
07:12:50,980 --> 07:12:54,040
I want to see it.
Justin smelling like tension music.

9676
07:12:54,041 --> 07:12:58,210
Do we have any like kind of intense with
the tension going stand by.

9677
07:12:59,500 --> 07:13:00,850
Okay.
This tension music's coming up.

9678
07:13:01,030 --> 07:13:01,863
I'm going to look at,
don't do anything stupid though because 

9679
07:13:04,541 --> 07:13:05,720
you're drunk,
but give it a lift.

9680
07:13:05,730 --> 07:13:07,030
Bite.
Bite the tip.

9681
07:13:08,170 --> 07:13:09,410
Give it a look.
Just just eat it.

9682
07:13:09,411 --> 07:13:10,070
Then I'll

9683
07:13:10,070 --> 07:13:11,660
tell you what.
I will like this.

9684
07:13:12,020 --> 07:13:15,590
If Aussie goes and play and learn this 
song,

9685
07:13:15,850 --> 07:13:18,320
so she's in the other room.
If she learns,

9686
07:13:19,640 --> 07:13:24,640
I will look to the song has to learn the
song and come in and play the song.

9687
07:13:26,510 --> 07:13:31,460
Okay,
here we go ahead.

9688
07:13:32,600 --> 07:13:34,460
Oh Yup.
Might as well eat it at that.

9689
07:13:34,490 --> 07:13:36,770
Oh boy.
God,

9690
07:13:37,020 --> 07:13:39,560
Joey.
Justin went in for a little suck.

9691
07:13:39,590 --> 07:13:43,940
Yeah,
a little sucky suck that you're doing.

9692
07:13:43,941 --> 07:13:45,200
Okay.
You might have to fight it.

9693
07:13:45,470 --> 07:13:48,350
That's apparently no,
I can tell you from experience,

9694
07:13:48,351 --> 07:13:51,110
just touching it to your lips.
Yo,

9695
07:13:51,111 --> 07:13:54,590
he's just sobered up the spiciest pepper
in the world,

9696
07:13:54,690 --> 07:13:57,350
dude.
And I'll tell you what,

9697
07:13:58,520 --> 07:13:59,353
I did that.
Now I want Asi to play Justin war 

9698
07:14:07,460 --> 07:14:10,110
winning.
Whatever this argument is with argument.

9699
07:14:10,160 --> 07:14:11,520
It's just,
what's that hot?

9700
07:14:11,580 --> 07:14:13,840
It's really good song and I'll see you 
shit.

9701
07:14:13,850 --> 07:14:15,050
How's the pen?
We've got the pepper.

9702
07:14:15,180 --> 07:14:16,013
Uh,
it's,

9703
07:14:16,030 --> 07:14:21,030
it's a spicy,
and this is going to be my home.

9704
07:14:24,350 --> 07:14:26,210
Can I just say my whole mouth is on 
fire.

9705
07:14:27,440 --> 07:14:28,640
I'm just,
I'm just playing

9706
07:14:28,760 --> 07:14:30,800
cool.
But my whole mouth is on fire.

9707
07:14:30,801 --> 07:14:31,730
It's very painful.

9708
07:14:32,910 --> 07:14:34,520
I'm going to look at everyone's taking.
Yeah.

9709
07:14:35,100 --> 07:14:37,860
I just want to hear this secretly that 
somebody donated.

9710
07:14:37,890 --> 07:14:38,820
Uh,
uh,

9711
07:14:38,940 --> 07:14:41,010
we have,
but lips are our good friend.

9712
07:14:41,020 --> 07:14:42,900
But out there,
$600.

9713
07:14:42,901 --> 07:14:46,380
Can Justin do a mighty,
mighty Leben grabbed screechy scream

9714
07:14:49,060 --> 07:14:50,680
for 600 bucks.
Go ahead.

9715
07:14:50,681 --> 07:14:54,370
Just wait right now while I'm thinking.
That's the idea.

9716
07:14:54,540 --> 07:14:56,800
Yeah.
I don't know how we'll do it.

9717
07:14:56,801 --> 07:15:00,520
As long as Aussie men is a psychopath.
All right.

9718
07:15:00,700 --> 07:15:03,250
How are you feeling about the whole 
thing in his mouth and he didn't react?

9719
07:15:03,740 --> 07:15:07,900
There's long as audrey problems turned 
up inside my mouth.

9720
07:15:07,990 --> 07:15:11,380
She's not in the room right now,
but I'm sure they're learning the song.

9721
07:15:11,770 --> 07:15:13,400
I think so.
I'm going to give it,

9722
07:15:13,510 --> 07:15:16,600
I'm going to give it a good shot.
I'm going to do it.

9723
07:15:16,770 --> 07:15:18,220
What do they,
you go first.

9724
07:15:18,880 --> 07:15:20,410
The exact words.
A mighty,

9725
07:15:20,411 --> 07:15:24,010
mighty lemon grabs screechy screams.
Oh,

9726
07:15:24,310 --> 07:15:26,980
so just say anything like lemon grab.
What should I say?

9727
07:15:27,160 --> 07:15:27,611
Probably.
I mean,

9728
07:15:27,611 --> 07:15:29,170
everyone just wants unacceptable,
right?

9729
07:15:29,171 --> 07:15:32,800
Or you know,
how about this hub of this?

9730
07:15:33,420 --> 07:15:34,180
God,
I don't know.

9731
07:15:34,180 --> 07:15:38,770
Fuck my vocal cords up.

arm is $400.

9733
07:15:42,321 --> 07:15:44,110
Here comes Justin [inaudible].

9734
07:15:44,111 --> 07:15:44,950

9739
07:15:55,070 --> 07:15:56,590

9741
07:15:58,340 --> 07:15:58,881
Okay.
So,

9743
07:16:00,831 --> 07:16:04,280

$96,773
and 66 cents.

9749
07:16:26,930 --> 07:16:28,770
Those extra good.
Considering that you're,

9750
07:16:28,860 --> 07:16:30,930
you just licked the fucking ghost 
pepper.

9751
07:16:30,960 --> 07:16:32,560
Okay,

9752
07:16:32,790 --> 07:16:35,430
We all and solidarity with you,
Joey,

9753
07:16:35,431 --> 07:16:37,590
which we appreciate.
I'm going to suck this little baby.

9754
07:16:38,220 --> 07:16:39,210
Oh yeah,

9755
07:16:39,211 --> 07:16:40,380

Oh my God,

9756
07:16:40,500 --> 07:16:42,720
Dude.
It's fucking hard that touch your tongue

9757
07:16:42,721 --> 07:16:45,210
or just hovering in your mouth that

9758
07:16:45,510 --> 07:16:48,600
And now the heat is,
the heat is building.

9759
07:16:49,170 --> 07:16:50,610
At first you feel nothing.
Yeah.

9760
07:16:50,611 --> 07:16:51,444
You don't feel anything builds.
That's why I was trying to eat the fast 

9761
07:16:53,761 --> 07:16:54,421

So cool.

9762

Oh my God man.
Describe it.

9763
07:16:57,000 --> 07:16:57,840
Well,
it's building.

9764
07:16:57,841 --> 07:17:01,260
It's like pepper spray in my mouth.
So when I did it,

9765
07:17:01,261 --> 07:17:03,600
I like sucked on it.
I did that and it hurt,

9766
07:17:03,990 --> 07:17:04,823
but I was just like,
I'm going to pretend like it doesn't 

9767
07:17:06,871 --> 07:17:09,030

Well sure because you didn't eat it.

07:28:03,250 --> 07:28:04,083
This night is really just begun.
We'll offered him to come back and play 

9992
07:28:07,571 --> 07:28:10,060
a really good song.
And then by the way guys,

9993
07:28:10,630 --> 07:28:12,410
if aussies cool with it,
we'll,

9994
07:28:12,420 --> 07:28:14,140
we'll open up another.
Uh,

9995
07:28:14,200 --> 07:28:16,500
we have to raise the price up though.
Cause like the,

9996
07:28:16,520 --> 07:28:19,240
that shit so bad to know.
We should close it up at this point.

9997
07:28:20,190 --> 07:28:22,760
Someone keeps asking me about my fondest
memories of interval.

9998
07:28:22,830 --> 07:28:24,400
Yeah.
You've got to give them that memory.

9999
07:28:24,520 --> 07:28:29,520
Hundred dollars from Neil kibbutznik.
Thank you nail Christmas miracle.

10000
07:28:33,310 --> 07:28:35,320
You know,
we are going to help a lot.

10001
07:28:35,510 --> 07:28:36,343
All this has just been amazing.
This has been inspiring a fuck then 

10002
07:28:39,341 --> 07:28:40,174
amazing.
I mean to say that our charity last 

10003
07:28:42,340 --> 07:28:45,370
year,
it was like the most by far by far I and

10004
07:28:45,371 --> 07:28:47,830
it looks like we did it again dude.
I can't believe it.

10005
07:28:47,860 --> 07:28:48,693
This is incredible.
We have to keep this going for two 

10006
07:28:50,051 --> 07:28:51,610
weeks.
I know it says seven days.

10007
07:28:51,611 --> 07:28:54,070
It's kind of same last year.
We'll do it for two weeks.

10008
07:28:54,480 --> 07:28:56,320
So I actually know what after this.

10009
07:28:59,250 --> 07:29:01,300
Uh,
thank you neil.

10010
07:29:01,301 --> 07:29:02,134
Thank you card Lynn.
My fondest memories of they say 

10011
07:29:04,121 --> 07:29:04,954
something.
Can I,

10012
07:29:04,960 --> 07:29:07,810
can I just say something like that?
And by the way,

10013
07:29:07,811 --> 07:29:08,644
I want,
I want the audience to sort of weigh in 

10014
07:29:09,611 --> 07:29:10,280
on this,
uh,

10015
07:29:10,280 --> 07:29:11,290
in the,
in the uh,

10016
07:29:11,350 --> 07:29:15,070
paid chat chat stream code,
custom kiss me,

10017
07:29:16,670 --> 07:29:17,340
I'll,
I'll,

10018
07:29:17,340 --> 07:29:18,130
I'll wait.
Go back.

10019
07:29:18,130 --> 07:29:18,963
You guys just need to do it.
That bar has been diligent that we 

10020
07:29:21,671 --> 07:29:25,240
reached that goal because we can't do 
the goal retroactively back to that chat

10021
07:29:25,241 --> 07:29:26,740
stream.
We can't do it retroactively,

10022
07:29:26,741 --> 07:29:28,540
but they've been,
they've been insistent on this.

10023
07:29:28,541 --> 07:29:30,910
It could just be a little,
we need to go.

10024
07:29:30,911 --> 07:29:33,050
We need a goal.
I don't kiss for free.

10025
07:29:35,590 --> 07:29:37,140
I caught him the way there's a lot of 
people.

10026
07:29:37,190 --> 07:29:42,190
Wayne person set up a goal for $2,000
uptalk starting to get more aggressive.

10027
07:29:42,491 --> 07:29:43,324
She's starting to,
we'll set up a goal of 2000 Dan when 

10028
07:29:45,251 --> 07:29:47,500
I've got a bag.
What I want to say?

10029
07:29:48,250 --> 07:29:50,800
It's not what I say.
Y'All shit in the shower.

10030
07:29:50,801 --> 07:29:51,320
I need to,
no,

10031
07:29:51,320 --> 07:29:52,210

Listen,

10032
07:29:52,211 --> 07:29:53,710
listen me,
it's a Tuesday night,

10033
07:29:54,460 --> 07:29:55,293
right before Christmas break.
What else did we get to do except make 

10034
07:29:57,611 --> 07:29:58,910
out?
Except for fuck's sake,

10035
07:29:58,920 --> 07:30:01,800
raise money for people's Egos.
Anyway,

10036
07:30:02,040 --> 07:30:04,350
Lips.
I'm saying,

10037
07:30:04,890 --> 07:30:06,640
I'm saying,
Hey Fox.

10038
07:30:06,641 --> 07:30:08,740
Mine.
Thank you for your hundred dollars.

10039
07:30:08,770 --> 07:30:11,290
I don't know what you said.
I don't understand what that means,

10040
07:30:11,291 --> 07:30:13,570
but thank you so much ty.
Kisses.

10041
07:30:13,620 --> 07:30:14,630
Oh yeah,

10042
07:30:14,640 --> 07:30:17,920
the donations are rolling.
103,000

10043
07:30:19,350 --> 07:30:20,620
so that's what I'm saying.
I'm saying.

10044
07:30:22,600 --> 07:30:25,480
I'm saying that we stay here for a 
little bit more.

10045
07:30:25,590 --> 07:30:26,423
We're not going anywhere.
We got shit and Austin is going to play 

10046
07:30:29,411 --> 07:30:30,244
some more songs.
We should open that back up for the 

10047
07:30:33,440 --> 07:30:34,273
Jews.

10048
07:30:34,300 --> 07:30:35,133
Sounds gnarly right now.
God Damn fucking pepper the Johnny Cash 

10049
07:30:38,741 --> 07:30:40,570
right now.
Jeez.

10050
07:30:40,571 --> 07:30:45,571
Rick Moranis voice.
We're bagging it up.

10051
07:30:52,590 --> 07:30:53,860
I'm going to fucking,
uh,

10052
07:30:54,550 --> 07:30:57,500
I'm going to take you in a shed.
Morty cheese.

10053
07:30:57,501 --> 07:30:58,334
Rick.

10054
07:31:00,050 --> 07:31:00,700
Geez.
Rick,

10055
07:31:00,700 --> 07:31:02,240
what are you talking about?
This is the GS.

10056
07:31:02,260 --> 07:31:03,093
Rick.
I don't want to go on the shed more to 

10057
07:31:04,881 --> 07:31:06,350
you.
What do you mean what?

10058
07:31:06,360 --> 07:31:11,360
Even a fucking suck in a buttholes that 
had gonorrhea.

10059
07:31:12,710 --> 07:31:14,160
This is a flu nightmare,
right?

10060
07:31:16,600 --> 07:31:19,640
Jeez man.
Suck it hard.

10061
07:31:19,750 --> 07:31:22,960
But Jose had gonorrhea.
Morty,

10062
07:31:23,020 --> 07:31:27,530
you're fuck I had gonorrhea but holes in
my mouth.

10063
07:31:30,710 --> 07:31:32,270
Morty,
you're a fucking mess.

10064
07:31:32,750 --> 07:31:37,100
I am just trying to hang on and raised 
money for fire victims.

10065
07:31:37,101 --> 07:31:37,934
Rick morty.
I don't know what the fuck you talking 

10066
07:31:41,151 --> 07:31:46,151
about.
Fucking this is that we're doing.

10067
07:31:47,570 --> 07:31:48,403
It's working.
This is what the book obviously in 

10068
07:31:51,610 --> 07:31:53,420
everyone to everyone.
By the way.

10069
07:31:53,540 --> 07:31:56,680
We started this fucking thing.
It like what type?

10070
07:31:58,280 --> 07:32:03,280
What type of oil?
Boy,

10071
07:32:04,131 --> 07:32:06,290
three o'clock.
That's when everyone's at home.

10072
07:32:06,380 --> 07:32:08,860
Eight fucking hours.
Is that the Gazebo?

10073
07:32:10,570 --> 07:32:13,250
This is the real time to fucking do it,
right?

10074
07:32:13,270 --> 07:32:15,490
Cause email comes down when you reach 
100,000

10075
07:32:15,500 --> 07:32:16,191
man.
That shit to do.

10076
07:32:16,191 --> 07:32:20,270
Dan Do.
We got calls to take a fifth who donated

10077
07:32:20,510 --> 07:32:23,000
for the call twice actually.
So Tony had $1,000

10078
07:32:23,001 --> 07:32:23,834
to do the column on the Goddamn fucking 
file phone system won't let us call 

10079
07:32:28,551 --> 07:32:30,140
internationally and nationally.

10080
07:32:32,160 --> 07:32:35,270
So why don't we call him from my phone 
and just hold it up to the mic?

10081
07:32:35,360 --> 07:32:36,490
Okay,
let's do that work for you.

10082
07:32:36,920 --> 07:32:38,810
I'll get him on the line right now and 
I'll come into the room

10083
07:32:38,880 --> 07:32:43,880
and then,
and then you'll take the yes dude.

10084
07:32:46,431 --> 07:32:49,430
That fucking pepper fucked my tender 
suck.

10085
07:32:49,460 --> 07:32:50,293
No,
but can I tell you they're going to get 

10086
07:32:50,901 --> 07:32:52,340
me a spicy?
Can I tell you that?

10087
07:32:52,341 --> 07:32:54,620
I can never do that again because like 
my voice,

10088
07:32:54,830 --> 07:32:56,060
your voice goes,
we'll see.

10089
07:32:56,061 --> 07:32:57,730
You've been shouting like a lunatic.
No,

10090
07:32:57,740 --> 07:33:00,110
that has nothing to do was to fucking 
pepper.

10091
07:33:00,111 --> 07:33:04,220
I was fine.
Are you doing all right?

10092
07:33:04,250 --> 07:33:06,170
How's your stomach?
It's just your mouth.

10093
07:33:06,720 --> 07:33:08,390
It's my,
it's my fucking throat.

10094
07:33:09,320 --> 07:33:12,080
Sounds like it's closing up guys.
Or is anyone hungry?

10095
07:33:12,081 --> 07:33:13,520
I mean,
we're probably not going to be here that

10096
07:33:13,521 --> 07:33:14,241
much longer,
right?

10097
07:33:14,241 --> 07:33:15,720
We shouldn't.
No.

10098
07:33:15,760 --> 07:33:17,450
So order order,
um,

10099
07:33:17,540 --> 07:33:18,500
um,
food.

10100
07:33:18,980 --> 07:33:20,330
Let's hang out.
No,

10101
07:33:20,331 --> 07:33:23,300
stop trying to look at you trying to 
fucking check out dude.

10102
07:33:23,350 --> 07:33:28,350
You have to try and have a fun day and

Half Day motherfuckers fucker.

10104

10112
07:33:59,890 --> 07:34:01,380
Vern.
This must be what?

10113
07:34:01,381 --> 07:34:05,400
Like,
like if they're paying to say that now,

10114
07:34:05,410 --> 07:34:08,010
I guess so.
I guess that's true.

10115
07:34:08,060 --> 07:34:10,210

07:35:08,760 --> 07:35:09,870
Well,
I'm saying I'll be here.

10137
07:35:09,871 --> 07:35:12,810
I'll stay all night.
I'll say all fucking night.

10138
07:35:13,020 --> 07:35:16,070
But what I do,
he wants to hear about the zoo.

10139
07:35:16,071 --> 07:35:17,280
Dude,
wait real quick.

10140
07:35:17,281 --> 07:35:18,114
I got to do a shout out.
I just got an email from somebody that 

10141
07:35:19,621 --> 07:35:20,670
we missed,
um,

10142
07:35:20,820 --> 07:35:23,160
that donate 500 bucks.
Nicole Sands.

10143
07:35:23,370 --> 07:35:24,270
Um,
I think we,

10144
07:35:24,300 --> 07:35:25,133
we actually did get an earlier donation 
where we wrote their website called 

10145
07:35:28,260 --> 07:35:30,090
those comics.com
on,

10146
07:35:30,091 --> 07:35:33,990
I think it's on Ethan's Fubu somewhere.
I think that was an ethan one.

10147
07:35:33,991 --> 07:35:35,140
Yeah.
Said let's take a look real quick.

10148
07:35:35,150 --> 07:35:36,150
Is that side.

10149
07:35:36,310 --> 07:35:38,710
And so what are we told me to look at?
Well,

10150
07:35:38,910 --> 07:35:40,560
listen,
thank you so much.

10151
07:35:40,561 --> 07:35:41,394
We're sorry we missed you.
And she also wanted to say it was 

10152
07:35:42,781 --> 07:35:43,614
important that she said she loves Ila.
Should we appreciate her so much as an 

10153
07:35:46,501 --> 07:35:47,850
artist?
We're all sad.

10154
07:35:47,851 --> 07:35:49,770
Eli's in here.
Very Sad.

10155
07:35:50,000 --> 07:35:51,690
Those are the name of the website again.
Damn.

10156
07:35:51,780 --> 07:35:55,110
It's colorless comic Dotcom comics,
not comics,

10157
07:35:55,111 --> 07:35:57,590
comic.com.
Check it out.

10158
07:35:58,040 --> 07:36:00,390
Sam's that little button.
I know that for some reason.

10159
07:36:00,600 --> 07:36:03,090
Is there any other,
you wrote it on Ethan over here.

10160
07:36:04,130 --> 07:36:05,910
That's why I know you're right.
All right.

10161
07:36:05,911 --> 07:36:06,810
We got shit to do.
Let's,

10162
07:36:07,080 --> 07:36:09,030
let's pump through it.
Um,

10163
07:36:09,180 --> 07:36:11,580
Ethan,
can we just hang out here and like while

10164
07:36:11,581 --> 07:36:12,414
we're together,
just you and I pull up a fun video and 

10165
07:36:14,791 --> 07:36:16,350
make comments on.
Absolutely.

10166
07:36:16,640 --> 07:36:17,850
Let's do.
Thanks Bro.

10167
07:36:18,090 --> 07:36:20,070
Oh Shit.
I need some fucking bearing.

10168
07:36:20,610 --> 07:36:22,200
Yeah,
we got all kinds of good shit.

10169
07:36:24,330 --> 07:36:24,810
Okay,
wait.

10170
07:36:24,810 --> 07:36:27,200
Oh,
somebody wanted me to talk about the the

10171
07:36:27,201 --> 07:36:28,650
the zoo level.
Yes.

10172
07:36:29,130 --> 07:36:34,090
So there's so many donations actually.
So no,

10173
07:36:34,100 --> 07:36:34,470
no,
no.

10174
07:36:34,470 --> 07:36:36,050
In all seriousness.
So,

10175
07:36:36,080 --> 07:36:36,913
so 103,000
accounting accounting was made as a 

10176
07:36:40,351 --> 07:36:45,351
collaboration between me and some water.
You good?

10177
07:36:46,080 --> 07:36:47,220
We got water.
I don't know man.

10178
07:36:47,221 --> 07:36:50,270
This shit is like fucking to mucus.
It's like a mucus buildup.

10179
07:36:50,280 --> 07:36:51,113
I'm starting to write.
It's fucked it all audio trying to 

10180
07:36:53,140 --> 07:36:54,070
protect itself cause

10181
07:36:54,070 --> 07:36:55,450
it feels good.
Yeah.

10182
07:36:55,451 --> 07:36:56,980
What the fuck?
Good too.

10183
07:36:57,070 --> 07:36:59,860
It is not cool from,
if I had known that was a case,

10184
07:37:00,940 --> 07:37:05,320
never done that shit sound like Duncan 
trussler right now it's just the mucus.

10185
07:37:05,440 --> 07:37:06,273
I Love Duncan trussell I sound like I 
ever want to sound like Duncan trussell 

10186
07:37:10,060 --> 07:37:12,770
I'll just eat a hot pepper and then 
people will be,

10187
07:37:12,870 --> 07:37:16,540
and I'll be able to do the Duncan 
trussell family hour podcast.

10188
07:37:16,570 --> 07:37:18,000
Mr.
But it'd be like Holy Shit.

10189
07:37:18,010 --> 07:37:22,130
$60 about the zoo level so we can just 
check it.

10190
07:37:22,140 --> 07:37:22,950
Oh yes.
All right.

10191
07:37:22,950 --> 07:37:24,400
So,

10192
07:37:24,430 --> 07:37:26,950
the secrets,
who level is a zoo is a,

10193
07:37:26,951 --> 07:37:30,540
is a thing that,
oh fuck God.

10194
07:37:30,600 --> 07:37:31,433
Oh my God.

10195
07:37:33,740 --> 07:37:36,140
Okay.
So no,

10196
07:37:36,210 --> 07:37:37,043
no,

10197
07:37:37,800 --> 07:37:40,320
Start at the c level story about 14.
Okay.

10198
07:37:40,370 --> 07:37:41,710
Okay.
So no,

10199
07:37:41,711 --> 07:37:42,431
no,
I mean it's,

10200
07:37:42,431 --> 07:37:44,140
it's a real,
it's a real fucking,

10201
07:37:44,141 --> 07:37:46,890
it's a real thing.
And is,

10202
07:37:47,310 --> 07:37:52,310
this is a partnership between,
between me,

10203
07:37:53,120 --> 07:37:56,190
uh,
between squatch games and,

10204
07:37:56,200 --> 07:37:57,033
and,
um,

10205
07:37:58,330 --> 07:37:59,920
and um,
and,

10206
07:37:59,990 --> 07:38:01,090
uh,
uh,

10207
07:38:01,240 --> 07:38:01,781
uh,
crows,

10208
07:38:01,781 --> 07:38:02,441
Crows,
crows,

10209
07:38:02,441 --> 07:38:04,680
which is one of the,
they did the Stanley parable.

10210
07:38:04,860 --> 07:38:06,490
One of the best,
by the way,

10211
07:38:06,491 --> 07:38:08,260
if you haven't played the Stanley 
parable,

10212
07:38:08,600 --> 07:38:11,380
fuck you go on steam right now.
And by the Stanley parable,

10213
07:38:11,381 --> 07:38:13,870
it's a fucking name.
If I'm not even kidding,

10214
07:38:13,871 --> 07:38:16,310
if you have not played that game,
fucking get on there and play it.

10215
07:38:16,311 --> 07:38:18,550
It's fucking amazing.
It's brilliant.

10216
07:38:18,580 --> 07:38:20,680
It's a brilliant game.
But anyways,

10217
07:38:20,681 --> 07:38:22,240
he level so,
so,

10218
07:38:22,300 --> 07:38:23,080
so,
yeah.

10219
07:38:23,080 --> 07:38:24,730
So is there a zoo level?
Well,

10220
07:38:24,731 --> 07:38:26,110
guess what?
Yeah,

10221
07:38:26,440 --> 07:38:27,840
there is.
And,

10222
07:38:27,841 --> 07:38:30,220
and they,
they went out of their fucking,

10223
07:38:30,520 --> 07:38:31,650
uh,
they went out,

10224
07:38:32,260 --> 07:38:33,093
they went out of their way to make sure 
that you couldn't just like data dump 

10225
07:38:39,041 --> 07:38:40,750
the fucking game.

10226
07:38:41,310 --> 07:38:42,770
Um,
God,

10227
07:38:43,000 --> 07:38:45,500
it,
this isn't,

10228
07:38:47,660 --> 07:38:50,530
there's so it exists.
It exists.

10229
07:38:50,560 --> 07:38:51,393
You can play it.
They went out of their way to make sure 

10230
07:38:52,810 --> 07:38:55,180
you couldn't,
you couldn't just like do like a,

10231
07:38:55,990 --> 07:38:58,790
like a data dump of the entire row,
uh,

10232
07:38:58,900 --> 07:39:00,010
the game,
you know,

10233
07:39:00,011 --> 07:39:01,230
all,
all the data,

10234
07:39:01,250 --> 07:39:04,630
the game and like find it and go,
oh,

10235
07:39:04,631 --> 07:39:07,000
there it is and here's what we have to 
do to get to it.

10236
07:39:08,500 --> 07:39:09,071
Like,
pretty,

10237
07:39:09,071 --> 07:39:09,970
pretty,
pretty,

10238
07:39:09,971 --> 07:39:11,710
like,
pretty like awesome.

10239
07:39:11,740 --> 07:39:12,580
Like,
you know,

10240
07:39:12,610 --> 07:39:16,330
Revolutionary Indie Shit.
Um,

10241
07:39:16,360 --> 07:39:17,193
so there you have it and the [inaudible]
and the fuck is who level does exist 

10242
07:39:21,700 --> 07:39:22,533
and,
and like good luck finding it because 

10243
07:39:24,130 --> 07:39:25,750
nobody has yet.
Oh,

10244
07:39:25,751 --> 07:39:27,550
for real.
It's an Easter egg that nobody's,

10245
07:39:27,610 --> 07:39:29,200
nobody's found and,
and,

10246
07:39:29,230 --> 07:39:30,430
and um,
yeah,

10247
07:39:30,850 --> 07:39:31,511
yeah.
And,

10248
07:39:31,511 --> 07:39:32,344
and,
and I think a big part of is because 

10249
07:39:35,110 --> 07:39:37,180
they're like,
picked it up.

10250
07:39:37,200 --> 07:39:38,950
They made sure that you couldn't 
actually,

10251
07:39:38,951 --> 07:39:40,930
for teaching me to love myself.
Love you guys.

10252
07:39:43,320 --> 07:39:45,190
All right,
well there you haggle.

10253
07:39:46,900 --> 07:39:47,950
Dan,
can you set up,

10254
07:39:47,951 --> 07:39:50,860
I seriously want to do for $2,000
goal.

10255
07:39:51,020 --> 07:39:52,010
We mean Justin will

10256
07:39:52,010 --> 07:39:54,260
finally give her a little peck.
Okay.

10257
07:39:55,640 --> 07:39:56,473
Why do you want a thousand dollar goal?
Because they keep begging for it so I 

10258
07:39:58,731 --> 07:40:00,170
don't want to let him went down.
Yeah.

10259
07:40:00,171 --> 07:40:03,750
But I want to go 2000 starting when,
right.

10260
07:40:03,770 --> 07:40:05,780
Well when I just want Dan to set up a 
bowl.

10261
07:40:05,810 --> 07:40:06,560
Okay,
no problem.

10262
07:40:06,560 --> 07:40:08,270
Also,
we've passed the eight hour mark,

10263
07:40:08,271 --> 07:40:12,910
which I think is actually the Max that 
the live stream we'll store said,

10264
07:40:12,920 --> 07:40:14,790
are you for real?
Yeah.

10265
07:40:16,500 --> 07:40:17,333
I mean maybe we could talk to youtube 
and see if they can make an exception 

10266
07:40:19,810 --> 07:40:20,643
for us,
but uh,

10267
07:40:20,690 --> 07:40:21,523
we,
we might either have to re up load or 

10268
07:40:23,720 --> 07:40:26,310
the end of this is going to get cut off.
No,

10269
07:40:26,350 --> 07:40:27,183
we're way,
if you're watching live just literally 

10270
07:40:30,921 --> 07:40:35,450
never done an eight or a license,
then that means fucking this.

10271
07:40:35,720 --> 07:40:38,840
This is a special that we share.
Are we sure about that?

10272
07:40:38,840 --> 07:40:41,360
That.
That's a thing I can definitely for sure

10273
07:40:41,361 --> 07:40:46,100
it is a thing at least because we didn't
get the seven hour and 40 minute mark,

10274
07:40:46,101 --> 07:40:47,680
so we're not that dangerous.
Okay.

10275
07:40:47,740 --> 07:40:48,360
Okay.
Okay.

10276
07:40:48,360 --> 07:40:50,710
Joey's eating that pepper we got to get,
no,

10277
07:40:50,720 --> 07:40:52,880
he's not.
We got to get him and we're only have 20

10278
07:40:52,881 --> 07:40:53,960
minutes left.
Hold on.

10279
07:40:53,990 --> 07:40:54,823
I know,
but,

10280
07:40:55,070 --> 07:40:59,710
but I thought,
I thought that we would be able to lower

10281
07:40:59,711 --> 07:41:01,460
and slower.
It's getting painful.

10282
07:41:01,640 --> 07:41:03,240
We only got 20 minutes.
I'll just shut us down.

10283
07:41:03,540 --> 07:41:05,230
We got to give people what they paid for
it.

10284
07:41:05,240 --> 07:41:06,380
Yeah.

10287
07:41:18,360 --> 07:41:19,193
the peppers and then youtube is going to
shut us down if we're going to do 

10288
07:41:23,581 --> 07:41:28,581
anything.
Yeah,

10291
07:41:34,400 --> 07:41:37,740
Brian.
Joe Jovana you've been watching since we

10292
07:41:37,741 --> 07:41:38,574
started.
You're a glutton for punishment and 

10293
07:41:39,931 --> 07:41:42,240
you're a hero.
Thank you so much for your donation.

10294
07:41:42,530 --> 07:41:47,530
You're a glutton for fun.
No,

10295
07:41:50,071 --> 07:41:51,840
that's bullshit.
Are you kidding me?

10296
07:41:56,330 --> 07:41:59,580
Welcome back everybody to the second ad

10297
07:42:01,960 --> 07:42:05,290
charity stream.
We have just crossed $100,000.

10298
07:42:05,410 --> 07:42:08,770
We have defied the expectation of 
everybody,

10299
07:42:08,771 --> 07:42:09,790
even ourselves.
Joey,

10300
07:42:09,791 --> 07:42:11,470
how are you feeling about this 
incredible,

10301
07:42:11,471 --> 07:42:14,800
incredible milestone we've hit?
Yeah,

10302
07:42:15,850 --> 07:42:17,770
that's how a lot of hype,
a lot of hype,

10303
07:42:17,771 --> 07:42:19,360
a lot of excitement.
Um,

10304
07:42:19,390 --> 07:42:20,500
what is,
what are we at,

10305
07:42:20,501 --> 07:42:22,240
by the way right now?
Can we uh,

10306
07:42:26,990 --> 07:42:28,500
wow.
103,

10307
07:42:28,680 --> 07:42:29,850
dude,
you know what?

10308
07:42:29,940 --> 07:42:32,850
We only have 20 minutes left on the 
stream before youtube cuts us up.

10309
07:42:32,970 --> 07:42:34,710
We are closing in on the eight hour 
mark.

10310
07:42:34,711 --> 07:42:35,830
So Joey,
why don't you Whoa,

10311
07:42:35,870 --> 07:42:40,870
get to take a seat and uh,
prepare yourself after being in this tub

10312
07:42:44,431 --> 07:42:44,850
with,
you know,

10313
07:42:44,850 --> 07:42:47,430
my feet being in this tub like my feet 
feel great.

10314
07:42:47,820 --> 07:42:48,900
Oh,
well there you,

10315
07:42:49,110 --> 07:42:50,460
we just,
we stumbled.

10316
07:42:51,060 --> 07:42:53,850
We stumbled upon something of area 
valuable.

10317
07:42:53,851 --> 07:42:55,260
They're good.
Keep a close eye on that.

10318
07:42:55,261 --> 07:42:57,630
I don't want to make sure we go over.
Don't go over that eight hour mark.

10319
07:42:57,631 --> 07:42:58,570
But Joey,
um,

10320
07:42:59,000 --> 07:43:01,830
now is the time really true that if we 
go over eight hours,

10321
07:43:01,850 --> 07:43:03,000
I yes,
it's true.

10322
07:43:03,030 --> 07:43:03,580
No,
it's true.

10323
07:43:03,580 --> 07:43:05,550
I've,
I've heard it is true.

10324
07:43:05,910 --> 07:43:06,960
What?
We can go longer,

10325
07:43:06,961 --> 07:43:09,480
but I want to make sure that we get this
because I can talk to them.

10326
07:43:09,750 --> 07:43:11,220
So here we go.
So Joey,

10327
07:43:11,490 --> 07:43:14,070
this is for the people.
This is for the fire victims.

10328
07:43:14,310 --> 07:43:16,770
I'm think that you're a superstar.
Think you're a trooper

10329
07:43:16,860 --> 07:43:19,890
or you're looking like a cracked out 
Santa and this is rock bottom.

10330
07:43:20,940 --> 07:43:23,430
Yeah.
People aren't believing anymore.

10331
07:43:24,810 --> 07:43:26,190
So go ahead.
Whenever you're ready.

10332
07:43:26,191 --> 07:43:30,090
Can we get a drum roll?
Can we get some music just to tip baby.

10333
07:43:30,360 --> 07:43:31,140
Just the tip.

10334
07:43:31,140 --> 07:43:34,860
You know how they do just the tip.
Just the tip.

10335
07:43:35,190 --> 07:43:39,120
Just the tip spongebob.
Where he's like,

10336
07:43:40,230 --> 07:43:42,090
we didn't have time for memes,
unfortunately.

10337
07:43:43,050 --> 07:43:45,960
Only got 20 minutes.
Good job.

10338
07:43:45,961 --> 07:43:48,030
Jelly.
Took a nice clean bite off the tip.

10339
07:43:48,780 --> 07:43:51,510
He took a nice clean bite.
Munched it down.

10340
07:43:52,590 --> 07:43:54,000
Yep,
he's working it.

10341
07:43:54,010 --> 07:43:55,830
He's tilting his head.
He's in pain.

10342
07:43:55,831 --> 07:43:57,660
He's wincing.
This is it.

10343
07:43:57,900 --> 07:44:02,900
Well second is faces can volted go ahead
joey.

10344
07:44:04,371 --> 07:44:05,430
Tell me about it.
It's hot.

10345
07:44:06,140 --> 07:44:07,050
It's hot,
it's hot.

10346
07:44:07,500 --> 07:44:12,120
The word is in a todd.
It's less.

10347
07:44:14,110 --> 07:44:16,110
It's not as bad on the stomach cause I 
didn't eat the whole thing.

10348
07:44:16,350 --> 07:44:18,090
But like all the spices in it.
That's true.

10349
07:44:18,091 --> 07:44:20,970
I'm glad you didn't get the whole thing 
cause that would have been a tragic,

10350
07:44:20,971 --> 07:44:23,480
but he swashing he's slashing.
They get,

10351
07:44:24,420 --> 07:44:25,890
he gets,
it gets dry.

10352
07:44:26,280 --> 07:44:29,490
So you gotta like water it down.
Exactly.

10353
07:44:29,491 --> 07:44:30,324
That's right.

10354
07:44:36,050 --> 07:44:40,470
Joe.
Joey.

10355
07:44:41,640 --> 07:44:45,100
Joey goes in for a second bite to prove 
his merit.

10356
07:44:45,670 --> 07:44:50,400
It looks like he's regretting it though.
He spit it out.

10357
07:44:50,650 --> 07:44:53,310
It doesn't look like you swallowed it.
Joey.

10358
07:44:53,460 --> 07:44:54,480
Joey,
how about this?

10359
07:44:54,720 --> 07:44:57,210
You don't have you chew that up.
You don't have to swallow it.

10360
07:44:57,240 --> 07:45:01,380
You can chew it up and the spit it out.
That goes to is worse here.

10361
07:45:01,400 --> 07:45:04,260
Well you ate more.
Here's what we're going to do,

10362
07:45:04,261 --> 07:45:05,640
cause I don't want to destroy your 
stomach.

10363
07:45:05,641 --> 07:45:06,474
Chew it up,
chew it up and then spit it out so you 

10364
07:45:08,761 --> 07:45:09,594
don't,
your stomach doesn't have to deal with 

10365
07:45:10,201 --> 07:45:11,430
all that.
Hold on.

10366
07:45:11,431 --> 07:45:12,264
Wait Joey.
The legend is putting it in his mouth 

10367
07:45:14,851 --> 07:45:17,670
and he's crunching it and now he's 
spitting it out into the,

10368
07:45:18,000 --> 07:45:18,781
into the mill.
Yeah.

10369
07:45:18,781 --> 07:45:19,880
That's good.
Shit.

10370
07:45:21,330 --> 07:45:23,970
Not Spicy.
You know what?

10371
07:45:23,971 --> 07:45:24,804
I think my,

10372
07:45:24,950 --> 07:45:28,760
my taste buds are all burned off.
It's not that bad.

10373
07:45:29,660 --> 07:45:31,730
Should we get another one?
Well,

10374
07:45:31,731 --> 07:45:34,010
there's another bag of ghost peppers.
Okay.

10375
07:45:34,040 --> 07:45:36,300
Joey is challenging us.
Grab the other bag that goes.

10376
07:45:36,301 --> 07:45:37,950
Peppers.
Great.

10377
07:45:38,030 --> 07:45:38,211
No,

10378
07:45:38,211 --> 07:45:40,130

There's another bag of Carolina reapers.

10379
07:45:40,131 --> 07:45:42,680
Grab those please.
The big fat ones.

10380
07:45:42,681 --> 07:45:45,980
So Joey is being a fucking absolute 
legend here.

10381
07:45:46,340 --> 07:45:47,770
Yeah.
What is this shit?

10382
07:45:48,580 --> 07:45:50,080
What'd you order these?
I Dunno.

Now there's another bag of low fat,
chunky little boys,

07:45:57,461 --> 07:46:00,010
Chub sisters.

What are we at here?
A hundred and fourth under three.

10394
07:46:21,371 --> 07:46:22,210
What are we out here?

10395
07:46:24,490 --> 07:46:27,010
There you have it.
These chunky boys.

10396
07:46:28,450 --> 07:46:33,450
All right.
Oh Man.

That's this is,

10400
07:46:40,180 --> 07:46:43,450
this is a dried Carolina reaper.
There's two different types.

10401
07:46:44,230 --> 07:46:46,420
Well here,
let me put this down over here.

10402
07:46:48,310 --> 07:46:49,870
Well,
he was calling them a little bit shit.

10403
07:46:49,871 --> 07:46:54,871
And you don't have to swallow it.
Remember took a big bite.

10404
07:46:55,390 --> 07:46:59,150
Half of the bite of the big Chubby,
spit it right out of the media,

10405
07:46:59,500 --> 07:47:01,170
right?
Yeah,

10406
07:47:01,210 --> 07:47:02,770
there you go.
That's the real deal.

10407
07:47:03,700 --> 07:47:05,710
Cause you never know,
you know with the farm.

10408
07:47:05,890 --> 07:47:07,150
Those are a little chubby boys.
Huh?

10409
07:47:08,350 --> 07:47:11,250
Give me the ghost.
We'll give them the ghost.

10410
07:47:14,810 --> 07:47:15,643
Justin,
his scream and give them that goes from 

10411
07:47:16,751 --> 07:47:21,751
the other room and here we go.
So you've already gone above and beyond.

10412
07:47:25,030 --> 07:47:26,380
Well,
he's not slowing them down,

10413
07:47:27,370 --> 07:47:28,720
so we're safe,
right?

10414
07:47:32,980 --> 07:47:35,080
Yeah.
All right,

10415
07:47:36,430 --> 07:47:40,810
Justin screaming.
Give him that ghost chewed up.

10416
07:47:40,811 --> 07:47:41,561
Chewed up.
I mean,

10417
07:47:41,561 --> 07:47:42,394
you know,
shoot up.

10418
07:47:44,050 --> 07:47:46,540
I'm getting,
I feel the pepper.

10419
07:47:50,410 --> 07:47:52,690
Maybe just cause there's three of them.
It's possible there.

10420
07:47:52,810 --> 07:47:57,810
They're all in a bit,
a larger higher league and it's Joey,

10421
07:47:58,541 --> 07:48:03,541
whatever you got to do buddy,
they want you to eat it.

10422
07:48:08,660 --> 07:48:09,880
I mean,
that's just the truth.

10423
07:48:14,230 --> 07:48:16,720
You're not in pain.
Well,

10424
07:48:16,721 --> 07:48:18,580
you're not chewing them up and you're 
spitting.

10425
07:48:18,590 --> 07:48:23,590
You're just giving like you gotta like

10426
07:48:24,851 --> 07:48:25,780
right?

Mitchell.
Thank you so much.

10429
07:48:28,390 --> 07:48:31,350
I'm,
I'm feeling the pepper.

10430
07:48:31,390 --> 07:48:33,220
Thank you.
Chew it up all the way.

10431
07:48:33,460 --> 07:48:34,271
There you go.
Keep chewing.

10432
07:48:34,271 --> 07:48:35,260
Keep chewing.
Keep chewing.

10433
07:48:35,620 --> 07:48:37,750
You don't have to swallow it,
but keep chewing it up.

10434
07:48:37,780 --> 07:48:39,490
There you go.
Now there you go.

10435
07:48:39,700 --> 07:48:43,120
Now he's getting there.
We have it and there we go.

10436
07:48:45,410 --> 07:48:50,150
So did that hit the spot?
Yeah,

10437
07:48:51,030 --> 07:48:52,220
I did it.
He did it.

10438
07:48:52,221 --> 07:48:53,960
Yeah.
I think you've got to really chew it up.

10439
07:48:55,790 --> 07:48:59,330
Is that right?
Are you an end more or less pain?

10440
07:48:59,331 --> 07:49:00,920
Then the third one,
I think my,

10441
07:49:00,921 --> 07:49:02,150
um,
I grew up an immunity.

10442
07:49:02,180 --> 07:49:03,470
You're just a meal.
Yeah.

10443
07:49:03,770 --> 07:49:06,320
Well there you have it.
We conducted a little science experiment

10444
07:49:06,321 --> 07:49:08,180
here and I think we've all learned 
something.

10445
07:49:08,780 --> 07:49:12,740
And most importantly we've learned that 
putting your feet in a rotten milk,

10446
07:49:12,741 --> 07:49:15,090
we'll give you a nice glossy finish on 
your feet.

10447
07:49:15,091 --> 07:49:16,790
Is that right?
That is true.

10448
07:49:17,300 --> 07:49:18,380
Well,
okay,

10449
07:49:18,620 --> 07:49:20,240
Joe,
you're a trooper and we thank you all so

10450
07:49:20,241 --> 07:49:22,250
much for your service.
You're doing okay.

10451
07:49:26,390 --> 07:49:28,190
All right.
Joey,

10452
07:49:28,350 --> 07:49:29,240
your legend,
man.

10453
07:49:29,360 --> 07:49:30,150
Yeah.
Big,

10454
07:49:30,150 --> 07:49:31,430
big up.
Big applause.

10455
07:49:31,580 --> 07:49:33,980
Good job.
What a legend.

10456
07:49:34,910 --> 07:49:35,760
That's bad.
That's,

10457
07:49:35,840 --> 07:49:40,510
that's the bad Santa sql we all deserve.
All right,

10458
07:49:42,700 --> 07:49:43,950
well what's going on in here?

10459
07:49:45,190 --> 07:49:47,200
I think we gotta wrap it up and we're in
eight hours.

10460
07:49:49,490 --> 07:49:52,520
All I know is we got another fucking 
skateboard we get,

10461
07:49:52,660 --> 07:49:54,680
I gotta have another skateboard to put 
together,

10462
07:49:54,681 --> 07:49:55,040
but

10463
07:49:55,040 --> 07:49:55,940
all right,
fine.

10464
07:49:55,941 --> 07:49:59,930
You want to fucking you in a fucking,
not give as much money away to,

10465
07:50:00,000 --> 07:50:03,050
sorry for victims of the,
we're reaching eight hours,

10466
07:50:03,051 --> 07:50:05,750
which at that point youtube cuts it off.
So there's literally,

10467
07:50:05,810 --> 07:50:09,440
oh,
is youtube the one that's going to say,

10468
07:50:09,800 --> 07:50:10,633
sorry,
you almost raised a bunch of money for 

10469
07:50:13,821 --> 07:50:18,110
poor people in California that we're 
fucked over by a fire.

10470
07:50:18,140 --> 07:50:23,140
It is us rich youtube.
People are going to have to say no.

10471
07:50:24,740 --> 07:50:28,090
We draw the line.
Here it is burning my mouth now.

10472
07:50:28,091 --> 07:50:29,150
I'm like,
thank you.

10473
07:50:29,240 --> 07:50:30,440
Nothing.
So Dan is,

10474
07:50:30,441 --> 07:50:32,660
do we,
so we owe a couple of calls,

10475
07:50:32,661 --> 07:50:33,950
is that right?
Is that it?

10476
07:50:34,700 --> 07:50:36,290
Uh,
it just one actually,

10477
07:50:36,291 --> 07:50:37,760
and they,
they sent me an alternate number,

10478
07:50:37,761 --> 07:50:39,860
so let me try him right now and if we 
could squeeze it in real quick,

10479
07:50:39,861 --> 07:50:41,450
that would be awesome.
And then do we have another song?

10480
07:50:41,451 --> 07:50:44,050
Is Aussie want to perform one more song?
Yeah,

10481
07:50:44,870 --> 07:50:46,850
I don't think she's going to tell that.
I don't think.

10482
07:50:46,870 --> 07:50:47,840
I don't mind.
I just,

10483
07:50:47,841 --> 07:50:49,460
I don't want to let her down.
If she's ready.

10484
07:50:49,790 --> 07:50:51,620
She's going here.
I don't think she's doing it.

10485
07:50:52,110 --> 07:50:52,943
Awesome.
And then let me know if there's any 

10486
07:50:55,941 --> 07:50:57,230
other big ones that we've got to shout 
out.

10487
07:50:57,231 --> 07:50:58,910
You guys are amazing.
One Oh four.

10488
07:50:58,911 --> 07:50:59,810
I mean,
this is like,

10489
07:50:59,811 --> 07:51:01,850
I'm,
I'm honestly so happy.

10490
07:51:02,000 --> 07:51:02,960
Yeah,
I'm blown away.

10491
07:51:03,500 --> 07:51:05,600
This is fucking amazing.
You guys are so,

10492
07:51:06,040 --> 07:51:07,040
oh,
did you set up the,

10493
07:51:07,041 --> 07:51:08,990
uh,
the milestone for the kiss?

10494
07:51:10,700 --> 07:51:14,070
No,
I just do it then.

10495
07:51:14,230 --> 07:51:14,651
No,
no,

10496
07:51:14,651 --> 07:51:15,041
no,
no,

10497
07:51:15,041 --> 07:51:15,874
no.
Set it up and then we'll move forward 

10498
07:51:17,501 --> 07:51:21,880
because that's big money.
Are you saying it's not more important,

10499
07:51:21,881 --> 07:51:23,140
Dan?
Nothing's more important.

10500
07:51:24,280 --> 07:51:28,230
You sign down here.
You want the bottle thing like dee dee,

10501
07:51:28,550 --> 07:51:29,830
yeah.
To your whole thing.

10502
07:51:30,160 --> 07:51:34,330
Okay.
Is this on film?

10503
07:51:35,590 --> 07:51:36,580
Yes.
Okay.

10504
07:51:36,581 --> 07:51:37,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

10505
07:51:37,631 --> 07:51:40,770
We've been on for saying this is all 
right.

10506
07:51:40,960 --> 07:51:42,220
Yeah.
Okay.

10507
07:51:42,221 --> 07:51:43,054
So,
Hey,

10508
07:51:43,530 --> 07:51:43,920
wait,
wait,

10509
07:51:43,920 --> 07:51:44,250
no.

10510
07:51:44,250 --> 07:51:45,490
Come on right here.
Oh,

10511
07:51:45,610 --> 07:51:49,830
right here.
Uh Oh no.

10512
07:51:50,100 --> 07:51:50,470
Here.
Wait,

10513
07:51:50,470 --> 07:51:51,480
let me go.
Let me go.

10514
07:51:51,481 --> 07:51:54,220
Let me get over there and show this.
Show this.

10515
07:51:54,610 --> 07:51:57,300
Show the camera.
It gets a little blurry,

10516
07:51:57,301 --> 07:52:00,030
I think when you get close because it's 
got a focal range.

10517
07:52:00,360 --> 07:52:05,360
God dammit that I'm in.
I can hear myself that what's going on.

10518
07:52:07,370 --> 07:52:08,670
Um,
we need that.

10519
07:52:08,880 --> 07:52:10,850
Sarah,
is it possible for you to set up a,

10520
07:52:10,880 --> 07:52:12,780
uh,
incentive,

10521
07:52:12,960 --> 07:52:15,000
the 2000 mark for a little smudge?

10522
07:52:15,760 --> 07:52:16,840
Because we're not going to make it.

10523
07:52:18,980 --> 07:52:21,470
Who gives a fuck?
All right.

10524
07:52:21,500 --> 07:52:25,220
We got six minutes apparently according 
to Dan to kind of make the most of it.

10525
07:52:25,430 --> 07:52:26,263
I'm just going to wait.

10526
07:52:28,440 --> 07:52:29,273
Why don't we,
uh,

10527
07:52:29,460 --> 07:52:30,293
why don't we let you too.
Why don't we stop and start new new 

10528
07:52:33,171 --> 07:52:34,050
stream?
No,

10529
07:52:35,460 --> 07:52:37,680
what do we know?
It's not good.

10530
07:52:38,250 --> 07:52:39,180
That would,
uh,

10531
07:52:39,181 --> 07:52:41,560
that would actually solve the problem.
Thank you Stewart.

10532
07:52:43,800 --> 07:52:44,790
Alright,
up dog.

10533
07:52:44,820 --> 07:52:48,210
You,
you need to chill is up to,

10534
07:52:48,211 --> 07:52:49,190
I'm telling.
I've done.

10535
07:52:49,210 --> 07:52:52,130
I'm trying,
but these guys are not doing that.

10536
07:52:52,180 --> 07:52:54,990
If there what I mean,
I'll go over eight hours gentlemen.

10537
07:52:55,020 --> 07:52:58,330
I don't mind going over eight hours Dan.
It's just that your dream.

10538
07:52:58,650 --> 07:53:00,060
Ethan,
stop talking about money.

10539
07:53:00,061 --> 07:53:00,894
What are you talking as a charity 
donation you could kiss this image is 

10540
07:53:02,671 --> 07:53:05,130
beautiful drawing of just the oil and I 
love that.

10541
07:53:05,131 --> 07:53:08,430
It's like I'm fine.
It would basically be be him dude.

10542
07:53:08,431 --> 07:53:09,264
Your,
I guess it's obvious to say but you are 

10543
07:53:10,531 --> 07:53:12,180
an incredible artists out.
Hey Man,

10544
07:53:12,181 --> 07:53:15,240
I'm doing my best.
Trying to capture,

10545
07:53:15,270 --> 07:53:16,380
trying to capture a spirit.

10546
07:53:17,460 --> 07:53:20,700
Ethan sergeant draw though cause your 
face has been in so many memes.

10547
07:53:20,730 --> 07:53:21,563
It's like I got all the memes in my head
and I'm like how do I capture the memes 

10548
07:53:24,271 --> 07:53:26,220
and the man at the same time?
Interesting.

10549
07:53:26,350 --> 07:53:27,183
I'm happening.
You've done a good one of me in the 

10550
07:53:28,441 --> 07:53:29,550
past.
It takes a minute though.

10551
07:53:29,551 --> 07:53:33,200
It's hard after it.
It was even harder to draw.

10552
07:53:33,450 --> 07:53:34,283
I'm donating the last dollar.
I love you all and have been watching 

10553
07:53:35,911 --> 07:53:37,710
the whole stream.
All they want us to see Justin sink,

10554
07:53:37,711 --> 07:53:39,890
Terry folds and see this message.
I don't,

10555
07:53:39,950 --> 07:53:41,460
I don't really,
and I'm flat broke.

10556
07:53:41,461 --> 07:53:43,620
I love y'all and I want to be like you 
all some day.

10557
07:53:43,680 --> 07:53:44,610
Thank you.
Austin.

10558
07:53:44,670 --> 07:53:45,540
Should we do a q and?
A?

10559
07:53:45,600 --> 07:53:50,600
I wanted to do another going on out 
there to do it.

10560
07:53:53,421 --> 07:53:55,200
Third a skateboard,
but fuck it.

10561
07:53:56,700 --> 07:53:58,530
While we should probably just,
um,

10562
07:53:58,950 --> 07:54:01,590
kill ourselves.
Justin's head too much ginger beer.

10563
07:54:03,260 --> 07:54:04,650
Hey,
you've had too much Japanese candy.

10564
07:54:04,651 --> 07:54:08,040
Justin Aussie.
He's going to perform as Dan.

10565
07:54:08,050 --> 07:54:09,220
Chez does like this out.

10566
07:54:10,960 --> 07:54:11,170
Okay,

10567
07:54:11,170 --> 07:54:14,020
well we can set that up there until for 
the next dance.

10568
07:54:14,470 --> 07:54:16,600
Don't take,
don't hurt yourself.

10569
07:54:18,100 --> 07:54:19,900
Milky.
I literally don't know what that means.

10570
07:54:19,930 --> 07:54:20,763
You want to prank call some shit after 
we'll start a new track and then we'll 

10571
07:54:24,251 --> 07:54:26,590
just prank call people.
Yeah.

10572
07:54:26,591 --> 07:54:28,240
Why not?
Fuck it where it's late.

10573
07:54:28,300 --> 07:54:30,980
We're up.
Okay.

10574
07:54:32,060 --> 07:54:33,580
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

10575
07:54:33,581 --> 07:54:34,414
you can.
Can I get a merry Christmas from Justin 

10576
07:54:35,710 --> 07:54:40,390
for my brother Dominic,
can you up on that?

10577
