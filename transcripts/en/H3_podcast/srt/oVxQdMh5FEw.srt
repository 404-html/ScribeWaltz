1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,940
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,163
two.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,243
Well,
hello everybody and thanks for joining 

4
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:11,721
us today on the HD podcast joined by the
wonderful Jack Black and kyle gas yes,

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,900
of tenacious d of whom we are all we all
love and appreciate.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,780
Uh,
today's episode is sponsored by me,

7
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:24,630
Andy's Vince Zero Robin Hood and meant 
mobile.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,920
Now you guys are here.
I can hear myself Dan,

9
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:29,754
but that's okay.
Do you guys have a new animated series 

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,270
posts apocalypto that is on youtube 
right now for free.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,473
Yeah.
Why isn't everyone closing this and 

12
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:44,090
watching that?
Well listen to what they have to say,

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,493
right?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,900
I think it's kind of hard to find,
but I'm an old man.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,093
I think the best way to find the full 
movie post apocalypto is to go to 

16
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:56,790
tenacious d.com
and just click on it there for free.

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,043
And if you also go to tenacious d.com
you can find out that these two 

18
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,800
wonderful men are touring all throughout
this month.

19
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,860
So grab some tickets and catch the d 
live.

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,923
The best one to see of all the shows 
were playing is a December 30th in Las 

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,170
Vegas.
We're doing something very special,

22
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:17,180
like it's,
I can't say what we're doing there,

23
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,040
but that's the one,
if you can,

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,933
you should get on a plane and fly to see
tenacious d in Las Vegas on a lot of 

25
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:25,960
people are gravitating.
Yeah.

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,320
Towards our New Year's eve show in Las 
Vegas.

27
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:34,321
And that's the natural show.
But the good show has nothing to do with

28
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:37,140
the tickets.
Tickets left.

29
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,450
It's a little well,
and also variety for your consideration.

30
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,130
Tenacious d did you guys see that 
though?

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,940
I don't know who put that in there,
Huh?

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,990
Well,
clearly I watched em

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,480
loved so much this,
this,

34
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:05,110
uh,
is it a movie or Shell?

35
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,640
Because it's six parts and then you've 
got it all together in one slot.

36
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:10,680
So do you think of it as a movie or a 
show or a show?

37
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,773
Well,
we have found that the best delivery 

38
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:15,204
system is actually on a big screen in a 
movie theater and just see it at all at 

39
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:23,470
once,
sharing it with the fellow fans.

40
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:24,120
And

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,460
it's more of a movie.
So we didn't know we,

42
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:30,630
I think we accidentally made a movie.
We're making little episodes.

43
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:33,510
You're making little five to 10 minutes 
episodes.

44
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:37,080
And then when we got,
when we got to the sixth episode,

45
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:37,914
the finale,
we realized if we took away the intro 

46
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:44,280
outro and,
and ran them as one movie,

47
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,590
it actually played the best.
So yeah,

48
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:48,150
we think of it in a lot of different 
ways.

49
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,340
It's an album,
it's a TV show.

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,360
It's a movie.
It could be a broadway play,

51
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,203
could.
It is.

52
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,823
Yeah.
Well the live show is very a rock opera 

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,040
ask presentation of

54
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,450
the material as well.
Yeah,

55
00:03:02,451 --> 00:03:03,880
that sounds Super Fun.
Yeah.

56
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,743
Yeah.
Now I can maybe one up and you know 

57
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,850
Bruce springsteen's on Broadway right 
now doing his show.

58
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:12,400
I don't think he has any,
any lights and magic.

59
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,000
He's an old singer songwriter.
So I thought,

60
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,290
why don't we just,
you know,

61
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,390
well,
I think you're kidding,

62
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,224
but I would,
I would watch the heck out of a post 

63
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:23,650
apocalypto Broadway show.
Well,

64
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,780
you know,
part of the reason why we did,

65
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,614
part of the reason,
part of the reason why we did post 

66
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:29,524
apocalypto as we were jealous of a book 
of Mormon are our arch enemies in south 

67
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:36,054
park.
Did this incredibly funny musical 

68
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,690
comedy.
If you get a chance to see it,

69
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:42,940
it's probably playing near your town 
now.

70
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,810
A Super Raunchy,
uh,

71
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,470
politically incorrect,
a broadway musical.

72
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,641
And we were like,
yeah,

73
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:54,520
we,
we want to party in that sphere.

74
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,410
Genre rock the dramas.
Well,

75
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,230
there's isn't really a rock opera.
Yeah,

76
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,090
you're true.
It's actually classical classic.

77
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,680
It was a broadway,
it was so hard to see.

78
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,470
And I was living in Israel at the time 
and there was so much hubbub about it.

79
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:12,304
I really wanted to see it.
And the only thing I was able to find 

80
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:19,651
was a gentlemen recording it on his cell
phone the best way,

81
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,320
one of the back isles.
And I have to say,

82
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:27,430
I don't remember much,
but I think it was good.

83
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,800
Yeah.
We should still like,

84
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,993
yeah,
we should catch it.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,833
Yeah,
but so you guys did everything on this 

86
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:37,060
and it's a very unique style you've got.
It's a cartoon,

87
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:40,030
but it's what,
it's like one frame every 10 seconds.

88
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,760
So you guys kind of,
which I find charming.

89
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:46,550
It's not like I wouldn't consider it 
like it's,

90
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,830
it's just a style.

91
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,670
And I think it's very charming.
Was this some like a style that you guys

92
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:55,360
chose four or was it kind of an 
expedient thing?

93
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,183
Well at first we were thinking this is,
we're just going to do a real rough 

94
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,970
version of what our fully animated show 
would be.

95
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,191
You know,
we're,

96
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:08,030
we were making our rick and morty 
basically and uh,

97
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,610
nobody wanted it on any other network.
So then we were like,

98
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,470
oh,
we're going to just do it our way.

99
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:18,720
And it was,
uh,

100
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,940
just the cheapest way to do it.
Right.

101
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,403
But at the end of the day,
it ended up being in a way funnier than 

102
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:27,910
it is here.
It is charming.

103
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,730
Yeah.
I,

104
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,240
there wasn't any point where I was like,
oh,

105
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,440
I wish I had more frames.
Right.

106
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,110
Cause you get it.
You totally got it.

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,590
And I mean this,
I totally understand.

108
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:41,620
As I watched that robot vagina suck and 
swirl on that cough,

109
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,483
I Scott boiler alert in a way.
It makes it less than a graphic while 

110
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:48,280
it's just frame.
You know what I mean?

111
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,030
I don't know.
I was,

112
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,620
I was stopped up.
I never,

113
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,080
I never wanted to fuck a robot before I 
watched your guys's go.

114
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,380
We're ahead of the curve for,
Hey,

115
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,100
when we're done with this youtube

116
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,933
series,
we're going to like release it on apple 

117
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,340
tv with an apple was like,
well wait a second,

118
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,010
you have to get a rating from the 
ratings board,

119
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,960
the MPA ratings.
And we're like,

120
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,310
fine.
We went to the MPA,

121
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:11,144
we paid them the thousand bucks or 
whatever it costs to get the thing and 

122
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:19,001
then they said this is nc 17 and it 
cannot be shown anywhere ever drawing of

123
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,314
a penis.
And it's like a badly drawn drawing of 

124
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:26,290
it,
but it's not like real photo realistic.

125
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,823
And at the end of the day,
I think it's like the sweetest 

126
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,540
pornography I've ever seen.
It's like it's got a,

127
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:37,541
it's got a real message of love.
It's not coming from a place of a

128
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,830
exploitation.
Absolutely no expectation at not at all.

129
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:43,780
Everyone is enjoying themselves.
There is,

130
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:44,614
I mean it's,
there's a scene of will the robot does 

131
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,880
put a finger on the but yeah,
and also,

132
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:49,714
spoiler alert,
take the balls and guys the penis into 

133
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:53,560
the vagina.
Oh Gosh.

134
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,850
But um,
I had,

135
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,960
I was free.
I was like,

136
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:56,794
wow.

137
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,760
Well in a way it's,
it's very uh,

138
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,490
educational.
That's true.

139
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,920
It saves you a conversation about the 
birds and the bees.

140
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:06,590
If you want to just show parents,

141
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,510
well you guys,
you guys gave a warning beforehand,

142
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,490
but through,
I noticed the only,

143
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,070
so on Youtube you've got these six 
episodes in the movie.

144
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,760
The only one that is an age restricted 
is the first episode.

145
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,370
And I don't know if you guys know about 
how youtube works,

146
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:25,360
but when a video gets age restricted,
they share it less.

147
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,470
Yeah.
Oh,

148
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:27,880
we know.
All too.

149
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:28,714
Well,
I think there's bots flying around 

150
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,400
looking for shapes of penis chariot.

151
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,373
Hey,
it's not the craziest that they don't 

152
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:35,994
share it.
It's like,

153
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,163
it's impossible to find the full movie.
If you type in tenacious d post 

154
00:07:41,371 --> 00:07:44,280
apocalypto full movie,
it still doesn't come up.

155
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,590
And if you have not signed Daniel can't 
watch it.

156
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,813
That's okay.
But I just want people to be able to 

157
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:52,110
find it.
That's why I'm only telling people to go

158
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:53,880
to [inaudible] dot com is the best way.

159
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,940
But,
um,

160
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,700
if you go to the channel,
you'll see it all there.

161
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,410
But yeah,
Youtube does it.

162
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:00,560
They bury stuff.
They,

163
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,403
they'll just bury it because they're so 
afraid of it harming their platform and 

164
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,140
scaring advertisers away.
But it's just a little,

165
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,950
what about this for promotion though?
The show youtube did watch.

166
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,413
That's excellent.
It doesn't that always have to watch it 

167
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:17,141
then.
Well,

168
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:17,974
I'm telling you,
you,

169
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,903
you're going to wash this robot,
swirl this vagina around a cock and 

170
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:21,844
you'd be like,
damn,

171
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,380
I can't wait for the future.
Yeah.

172
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,760
I mean,
the future is already are robots.

173
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,040
They're talking about robot and draw 
falls now.

174
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,120
Yeah.
So I heard of a sex doll bronco,

175
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,743
but I don't know that there's mechanics 
in the vagina because we're always just 

176
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:40,300
a sloppy plastic is just around the 
corner.

177
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,110
That sounded really appealing.
Now would you guys fuck a robot that had

178
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:45,100
like a super badge?

179
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,450
Um,
I must admit in my youth,

180
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,000
I think there might've been a doll 
experience.

181
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,320
Tell me about that more.
Well,

182
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,183
I might've continued in the early days 
of experimentation when you want to 

183
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:06,564
practice.
I think that the adults can be a great 

184
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,310
educational tool.

185
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,790
I fully,
first of all,

186
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,230
no judgment on my side.
I mean,

187
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:16,064
I put at that age,
you put your Dick in just about 

188
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:18,974
anything.

189
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,010
Yeah.
I mean,

190
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,290
tell me about what did the doll look 
like?

191
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,260
Kind of like a,

192
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,560
where do you get those because you'll 
have to be of age or do you get those at

193
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:33,520
a six shot?

194
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,713
It,
there might've been some shoplifting 

195
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,430
involved.
Like I should go into all the detail.

196
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,563
There might've been a crazy night out 
from a ucla that's in the theater 

197
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,170
department.
Uh,

198
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,690
yeah,
I might've been like 19 years old.

199
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:54,524
So it's like,
wait,

200
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,410
that's a little old for,
for uh,

201
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,090
needing a doll.
Well,

202
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,003
no,
there's no age limit on when you need a 

203
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:03,210
dog.

204
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,530
Well,
apparently you are not,

205
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:05,364
you can't even buy it until you're 18.
So the people that need it the most 

206
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:09,210
don't have access to it.
Right?

207
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,940
Yeah.
In fact,

208
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:13,490
I think maybe the target audience is,
is uh,

209
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,300
men in their forties for the dog.
Huh?

210
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,770
It could be.
Absolutely.

211
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,970
Thank God I'm too old for that.
I think I just,

212
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:25,500
depending on a large pillow,
I think with that vivid imagination,

213
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,420
um,
I have,

214
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,380
I want to expand on this further and I 
don't know,

215
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,990
I'm taking it too far.
But if you fuck a robot sex doll,

216
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:34,824
is it cheating?

217
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,300
Oh,
if you're married and you have,

218
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,251
and then you're like,
oh,

219
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:43,830
I want this vagina can swirl and soc and
do all of them do everything.

220
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:46,050
But I mean it's just a robot.
Is that cheating?

221
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,200
Uh,
I think it depends on the,

222
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,550
the,
the secrecy of the act.

223
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,423
If,
yeah.

224
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,690
Um,
hmm.

225
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,490
Maybe,
maybe you're going on the road,

226
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,310
uh,
to do a job and your wife would actually

227
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:04,660
give you a doll or like a little,
a little flashlights,

228
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,580
something that would fit in the,
isn't a fleshlight basically,

229
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:08,414
or a sex robot.

230
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,690
Well,
it's not a robot,

231
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,910
but it is a sex flush.
Like,

232
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,490
well,
let me show you a flash.

233
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,180
A flashlight.
Can I kill the question?

234
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,730
I don't understand what you think.
Oh Wow.

235
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,780
There's a,
there's a lot there.

236
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,970
Well here,
this point is not very graphic.

237
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:33,120
So let me show you this one.
Christ sake.

238
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:36,090
It's on Amazon here.
Wasting my time with my hand.

239
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:37,490
This all these years.
Well,

240
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,060
so,
so let's start here.

241
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,200
Ila is a fleshlight,
uh,

242
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,580
infidelity.
Hmm.

243
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,740
So here,
this is a fleshlight usually shaped more

244
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,780
like a vagina,
but I don't want to think you can see it

245
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:49,670
on the screen there.
Oh.

246
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,380
But it's a basically,
and I love that they make it look like a

247
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,280
flat,
like a flashlight

248
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,980
of all things.
Like put your Dick in this flashlight.

249
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,050
Any,
any kind of sphere or any kind of,

250
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,330
does it light up?
So there's no light.

251
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,560
There's,
Oh wow.

252
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,130
Does this only when you're doing it.
But here we have a video.

253
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,930
Please don't be a penis.
Okay.

254
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:11,764
We'd better know.
It seems like the light could create 

255
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,270
some warmth.
Hmm.

256
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,473
Wow.
So can I use a fleshlight Isla without 

257
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:25,840
consulting with you?
Um,

258
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,020
I guess it would just be a little weird 
if you did.

259
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,750
Okay.
So if it doesn't have a face,

260
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:36,130
it's not cheating.
I don't think the parameter just have to

261
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:36,964
be decided on together.
But what's the fleshlight and 

262
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:44,140
masturbating and sorry doing include you
guys on this conversation.

263
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,200
It's all right.
No masturbation.

264
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,510
Well maybe.
Yeah.

265
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,360
Is Masturbation shooting?
Yeah.

266
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,400
No,
no,

267
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,110
no.
Especially if you're like,

268
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,810
ah,
get outta here and go masturbate.

269
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,950
Yeah.
You don't want to see that.

270
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,420
Exactly.
I think I was reading though you,

271
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,010
it's important that you should 
masturbate together though.

272
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,960
You should be.
Not all the time.

273
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,240
Well no,
but comfortable enough with that contact

274
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,000
laser.
We need to try that cow.

275
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:20,030
I assume you guys had done that.
That was a Howard Stern interview.

276
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:24,510
I heard that.
Yeah.

277
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:26,920
And Ringo claimed he wasn't there for 
that session,

278
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,770
the band,
yet he had the perfect alibi.

279
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,583
He was there finally.
I find it funny how people made such a 

280
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:37,060
big scoop out of it.
Well,

281
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:38,830
it's funny besides that,
it's funny,

282
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:39,664
but like people started trying to draw 
the conclusion that they were like 

283
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,380
lovers and all this,
you know,

284
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:46,270
and it's just a couple of dudes jerking 
off in the dark.

285
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,223
I mean,
right.

286
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,633
They're young.
They're all up the early Beatles and 

287
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:52,810
maybe,
yeah,

288
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,423
maybe that's why they kicked out the 
drummer if they didn't like the way he 

289
00:13:57,281 --> 00:14:02,281
masturbated with them was a snare and 
all the ladies though he was an American

290
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,630
and apparently he was very good looking.
Is he still available for drumming?

291
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,203
Curious.

292
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,040
You've got Sasha?
No,

293
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,953
we got,
we got,

294
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,080
we got great drummer.
Um,

295
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,380
so you guys did the voice,
the art,

296
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,670
the music,
the writing.

297
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,840
This is your baby post apocalypto yeah,
you're saying tour De Force?

298
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,490
I was,
I,

299
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,503
that was coming next toward him from 
wars and who was the art director 

300
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:36,301
because there is a very distinct art 
style throughout art direction.

301
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,870
All Art Times,
man.

302
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,783
I actually tried to draw a cell just to 
show Jack what it would be like if he 

303
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:46,060
wasn't drawing it and it was really bad 
burns.

304
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,240
Did you actually draw it?
I did draw it,

305
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,730
but we got uh,
uh,

306
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,023
how probably too we got a colorist is a 
amazing Michael Molina to do all the 

307
00:14:57,471 --> 00:15:01,070
color with his computer and uh,
yeah,

308
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:01,904
we were going to hand over the reigns to
some other animator and artists at some 

309
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,364
point.
But that was back when we had dreams of 

310
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,650
having a Netflix or hbo series and then 
we were like,

311
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,850
it's better this way.

312
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,300
Anyway,
we were laughing until late version,

313
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,270
but butthead isn't well drawn,
but it's great.

314
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,890
It's someone or to draw beavis and 
butthead a style.

315
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,490
It's because they're badly them.
So hilarious.

316
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,040
So nobody wanted to show,
I mean I find that a pure insanity.

317
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,380
Well I would love spicy somebody's neck.
What was that one?

318
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,580
Yeah,
the color was interested.

319
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,330
Well,
I forgot.

320
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:46,430
I know none of the major players,
but where are you guys uncompromising on

321
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,910
the penis and set like very graphic sex 
shots.

322
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,240
We presented what we wanted to put on 
the air.

323
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,051
We weren't saying,
hey,

324
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,520
we want to do something like this.
We were like,

325
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,960
we want,
we want to do this.

326
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,890
Yeah.
No one wanted to go with us down that,

327
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,783
that,
uh,

328
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,300
crazy a half.
But,

329
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:09,320
um,
in a way we were kind of glad about that

330
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:10,160
because,
uh,

331
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,970
it gave us an opportunity to really go,
it seemed kind of liberating.

332
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,811
It's like,
yeah,

333
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,520
no,
it's just kind of a fun project to do it

334
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,354
with your friends.
Exactly how we want to do to make it 

335
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,133
well,
I loved it and I urge everyone to go 

336
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,040
watch it now.
You guys,

337
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,930
do you guys watch youtube?
I know.

338
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,480
Oh really?
I do.

339
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,553
Could you do,
you're like,

340
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,240
Oh yeah,
I'm sorry.

341
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,520
Oh Man.
Thank you.

342
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,363
Well,
I'll just go down and strange wormholes 

343
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,493
as we call like a wow.
I wonder if thin lizzy played a live 

344
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:42,524
concert in the UK in 74 or something and
I'll just find myself watching fold 

345
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:50,150
concerts or anything.
I mean,

346
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,273
where it leads and Youtube's got a 
brilliant at leading you to the next 

347
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,920
thing might be like,
oh,

348
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,910
that's where I would be interested in 
that.

349
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:59,390
And yet their algorithm,
they know if there,

350
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,224
then we do.
Yeah.

351
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,101
Yeah.
So,

352
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:02,270
uh,
I find it,

353
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,040
yeah,
eminently entertaining.

354
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,910
That's great.
But I guess I'm,

355
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,780
most people don't watch it like I do.
Well,

356
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:10,820
there's different,
there's different worlds.

357
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:15,850
There's people that like watch youtube 
for the personality or I don't know what

358
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:18,314
to say.
There's people that could produce 

359
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:23,840
content on youtube and then there's,
I think a lot of people like you who use

360
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:24,674
it just because everything's on youtube 
cause everything's going watch 

361
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:27,680
tutorials.
You can watch music,

362
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:28,514
you can watch bands,
and then you just go down this crazy 

363
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,183
rabbit hole of like endless content.
So there's two types of people and I 

364
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:36,830
guess you're very much,
they'll,

365
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:38,420
well,
and there's the endless,

366
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:42,200
I mean,
how do I play of something on guitars?

367
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,583
It's like,
wow,

368
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,750
that's so easy.
Yeah,

369
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:45,561
it is.
Jack,

370
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:48,770
do you use,
I do go on the youtubes.

371
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,733
Uh,
mainly to like figure out how to make 

372
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:55,890
potato lot because like that I'd be 
doing today,

373
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,490
I'm having some family over this evening
for a Hanukah celebration though.

374
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,393
Let me see if I know I've never made the
potato lot because somebody else in the 

375
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:08,160
family,
it would be in charge of those.

376
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:10,020
So this time,
how did you get stuck with luck?

377
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,660
QCA duty this year?
Um,

378
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,070
it's,
you know,

379
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:18,660
it's sad but my mom used to make the lot
just recently so I'm sorry.

380
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,290
But uh,
yeah,

381
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,050
so I think it's going to take a village.
We're all done.

382
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,993
I'm going to have,
I have a bunch of graders and a pile of 

383
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:30,894
potatoes.
I think log cause is like poker as they 

384
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:35,454
say.
It takes a day to learn a lifetime to 

385
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:38,760
master.
Yeah.

386
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,923
So you will be a lot code kings like 
you're always just one youtube video 

387
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:45,900
away from making the perfect lots cup.
That's true.

388
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,460
That's my,
in this day and age.

389
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,313
Do you guys live,
do your light the Menorah and do the 

390
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:52,770
whole thing?
Of course.

391
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:54,690
You say the prayer.
Are you ready for it?

392
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,330
Are you kidding me?
Tell me if I do this correctly.

393
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,743
I'll tell Ya.

394
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,230
Bottle.
Ha.

395
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,530
Yeah.
Hello.

396
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,990
Hey Dude.
This is the hard part.

397
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,640
I shed get a baby's photon.
The tiva.

398
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,483
Huh?

399
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,830
Very hard.

400
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,120
Ha.
That's impressive.

401
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,410
Um,
wow.

402
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,240
Rabbi black

403
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,100
music.
The savage beast.

404
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,120
Do you know any other Hebrew prayers?
Because I am just,

405
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,390
I bought it already.
I know some of the songs.

406
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,840
Oh No.

407
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,260
Give like a modern,
hey,

408
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,610
hey.

409
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,443
Well you know what?
It doesn't sound like that was written 

410
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,090
back in the 18th century.
Oh pretty sure.

411
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:03,424
Jesus,
they had him in a chair and they were 

412
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,820
doing the whole,
yeah,

413
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,530
I don't remember that.
A Jew.

414
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,290
The Jews,
in fact,

415
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,383
the king,
you actually pronounced everything 

416
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:18,010
correct too.
Cause she's Israel.

417
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,663
Shalom.
How do you say thank you in Hebrew toe 

418
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,890
down.
When in doubt I go Shalom.

419
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,430
It means so many things.
Yeah.

420
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,103
Yeah,
it is.

421
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,320
Um,
you are a,

422
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,470
a lot of us were surprised to learn that
you're Jewish.

423
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,304
I don't know why,
but that's came as a surprise to a lot 

424
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:42,394
of us.
But you,

425
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,460
your father was born a Jew.
Oh my father was,

426
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,910
my father was born Protestant.
Right.

427
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,970
My mother was born a Jew,
which makes me full Jew according to the

428
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:55,621
Jews.
I,

429
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,580
man,
I'm not out.

430
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,483
I'm not questioning your doing.
And the idea is we know where you came 

431
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,970
from because we have witnesses were not 
positive if your dad was a Jew or not.

432
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:08,284
So true.
I never thought of it that you came out 

433
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:11,800
of that vagina.
You are.

434
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,010
Yes we did.
We don't have DNA.

435
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,080
Right.
You are.

436
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,773
Is that the best show everyone,
they start break dancing and shit in 

437
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:21,304
front of the baby.

438
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
That I love it.
I love it so much.

439
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,700
But your story is unusual because I'm 
usually,

440
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,690
I find that it's the male or the female 
that a convert to Judaism.

441
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,570
But your dad converted to Judaism,
right?

442
00:21:39,571 --> 00:21:40,990
Yeah,
I find that fascinating.

443
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,990
Well,
it wasn't just because he loved my mom,

444
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:46,690
but also because uh,
he was into Judaism.

445
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,690
Wow.
But since they divorced,

446
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,120
he is now no longer a practicing Jew.
He drunk.

447
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,170
It's like when you lose certain friends 
in a divorce,

448
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,030
you lost.
He left the dude.

449
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,350
But uh,
yeah,

450
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,420
so,
so I was raised you,

451
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:05,254
I got my bar Mitzvah and then I 
immediately sort of a bales you taking 

452
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,280
the chance or price.
Exactly.

453
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,500
They'll do the,
but now you're back.

454
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,363
They'll do the bar Mitzvah and then 
they'll stick around until 16 or let it 

455
00:22:17,851 --> 00:22:22,851
sit around for the confirmation hearings
or whatever it is that I booked it at 13

456
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,810
I know what the calls from hr then 
officially adult.

457
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,240
Well you get the check,
you got the check,

458
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:30,530
right.
Get the big pay that I would expect.

459
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,900
That's the socks and an intellivision 
cartridge.

460
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,580
Somebody got the money,
somebody.

461
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,790
And a lot of times the parents will be 
like,

462
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,624
thank you.
Repaying all those years of tourists 

463
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:43,504
school.
Cause I know my parents got thousands 

464
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,440
and all they bought me and I was 
grateful at the time.

465
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:49,000
But in retrospect I'm like,
Holy Shit.

466
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,940
They bezels my bar Mitzvah money and 
this is a,

467
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:53,230
yeah,
I'm calling you guys out.

468
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,390
All I got was a [inaudible] 64 and I 
know they got like 10 Jews and 64 C.

469
00:22:58,391 --> 00:22:59,224
I'm a little older than you because 
Nintendo wasn't even out in 1982 when I 

470
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:05,560
got my bar Mitzvah.
You got socks?

471
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,900
Yeah,
Emma and television cartridge.

472
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,630
It was,
it was a sad turnout,

473
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,250
but,
uh,

474
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,390
it was a celebration because as you say,
I no longer had to go to Hebrew school,

475
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,450
which was additional school.
I had school and then I had to go school

476
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,580
Tuesdays and Sundays.
You go in the evening.

477
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,890
Well,
it's so,

478
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:28,780
Isla doesn't understand but are 
pressured by they,

479
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,703
they part of your life.
You didn't have to think about extra 

480
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,420
Judaism.
Yeah,

481
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,970
exactly.
She doesn't understand what us,

482
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:37,804
American Jews have been.
She speaks Hebrew and she doesn't 

483
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:43,300
understand that.
We just learned the Hebrew,

484
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:44,134
so we couldn't do the Bar Mitzvah and 
that of us even know what the F we're 

485
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,970
talking about.
Yeah.

486
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:49,970
That's pretty weird.
I still have a couple words.

487
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,760
Shalom.
Ah,

488
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,080
Ema,
Ema.

489
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,350
[inaudible].

490
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,790
Wait,
where did he say?

491
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,530
What was that like pesach,
Passover.

492
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,140
Maneesh Denalis some lyrics from a song.
I don't even know the painting goes.

493
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,660
Well,
my favorite,

494
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:12,560
if you guys want something to take away 
from this is a by rule Hashem,

495
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,430
I'll root.
Which means you're like,

496
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,860
Oh man,
this is live.

497
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:21,170
We can't go back these rot.
Hachette,

498
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:24,350
which means it's like what God's house 
with God's help.

499
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,800
When someone will say like,
let's say,

500
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,120
Oh,
you're going on tour.

501
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,770
That's cool.
You'll say,

502
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:33,530
but it's lots of shame.
Like what I liked about it.

503
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,510
Yes,
but let's not,

504
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:40,550
let's not get over our skis.
But what I like about it is when you use

505
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:44,580
it and very like trivial things like,
well,

506
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,670
I'm going to take a sh,
I got to go take a shit.

507
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,590
[inaudible] Hashem with God's help.
You know?

508
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,140
That's when it really gets a little more
humorous.

509
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,880
I love it.
Love it.

510
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,620
Just thinking about the prayer,
but real and ny,

511
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,980
it's blessed at our God king of the 
universe.

512
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,020
Amaz yeah.
Could you use that in every day?

513
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,890
Like,
yeah.

514
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,930
Big Mac,
King of the universe.

515
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,150
I don't know.
That might not work.

516
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,200
Uh,
yeah.

517
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,510
That reminded me of flash can go for the
impossible.

518
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,100
Yeah.
Oh,

519
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,920
that makes me think I need to see that 
queen movie.

520
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,560
Oh yeah.
Have you seen huge fan of Queen?

521
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,633
Very little desire to see it.
I know it was kind of the thing to see 

522
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:39,680
and then it wasn't the thing to say.
It was weird,

523
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:41,670
like the opposite.
It was,

524
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,533
well,
it was the thing to see it and then it 

525
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:46,040
wasn't the thing to see.
And then I think it is the thing,

526
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,430
not the thing to say no,
like it's become a worldwide phenomenon.

527
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,293
The good really,
I saw it all over the world when it 

528
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,054
wasn't the thing to see.
And I was so pleasantly surprised 

529
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,670
because it wasn't the thing to see.
And it was good.

530
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,523
It was like,
yeah,

531
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,040
I mean he'd go in his,
it's a Hollywood biopic.

532
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,570
Yeah.
They're going to fudge this,

533
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:06,890
that and the other and the details.
What?

534
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:09,080
It's like that guy's performance.
I mean,

535
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:10,040
imagine like,
okay,

536
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:13,410
you got to play Freddie Mercury iconic,
uh,

537
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,550
charismatic rock star of all time and 
just nail it.

538
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,181
Work on that.
I mean,

539
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:21,230
he does.
Wow.

540
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,670
Kind of,
kind of amazing.

541
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,533
Well,
I guess I should see it because I'm a 

542
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:28,610
huge fan.
There's a new phenomenon that one of,

543
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:29,444
uh,
when someone on Youtube pointed out 

544
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,180
really funny,
Lee,

545
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,433
that there's a phenomenon of people 
pretending they've never heard Bohemian 

546
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:37,150
rap.
Oh God.

547
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,031
Oh,
I saw that.

548
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,310
I'd like the adults listen to that thing
we did.

549
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,660
Oh yeah.
Oh,

550
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:42,790
like people react.
Yeah.

551
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,450
People react to whatever the phone bros.
Why would they,

552
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,190
why would they pretend like they have 
never heard?

553
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,310
Cause they're getting tons of views and 
it's like related to the video,

554
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,520
but it's like everybody gets hurt.
Come on everyone's door.

555
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,083
They go and they go and they were like,
here's a song by a [inaudible] queen of 

556
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,520
wrap Saudi.
Uh,

557
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,960
and they're like,
why?

558
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,323
Anyway,
Gus Johnson made a video about it and 

559
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:13,340
he's like,
why are they all aligned?

560
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,723
They're all wine.
It's like the Jimmy Kimmel live witness 

561
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:19,140
news.
Yeah.

562
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:20,530
It's getting people to say anything.
Yeah.

563
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,680
You can't.
Well,

564
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,514
they,
yeah.

565
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,723
So we're going to throw it to a quick 
commercial break that we have 

566
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:28,560
prerecorded for our convenience.

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:30,963

568
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,330
But we'll be back after this short 
commercial break with these two fine,

569

hey,
is that a chopstick or my penis and my 

582
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:16,070
case?
It's hard to tell the difference.

583
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,320
It's not as long as the chopstick,
but it is as then why stop it undies.

that luxury is a process.

599
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,810
It's not about specs and it's not about 
price.

600
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,030
It's not a marketing term to be thrown 
around.

601
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,570
It's about attention to detail as step 
by step process to craft.

Every product is this process that 
separates us from the competition,

00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:31,880
yes,
you deserve the best.

606
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,893
They are tired of cookie cutter designs 
and mass produce mentalistic watches 

607
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:38,720
that have flooded the market.
They want to offer a watch that was able

608
00:29:38,721 --> 00:29:40,420
to stand out,
get noticed,

609
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,360
get your Dick sucked and set yourself 
apart.

610
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,650
Rather than conform to civil design all 
at an accessible price,

611
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,723
they are able to provide the look and 
feel of bold luxury watches that are 10 

612
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:55,720
times the price by selling directly to 
the customer.

613
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,030

617
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,110

636
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:12,490
app and he says that they have tutorials
that show you and kind of take your hand

637
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:15,190
and tell you what you're doing so you 
can learn as you trade.

683
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,260
So we've got a lot of a development.
It's over the break.

684
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,543
Uh,
my parents are listening and they have 

685
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,790
some beef with what I said about that,
uh,

686
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,190
uh,
embezzling

687
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,810
my bar Mitzvah money.
So go ahead down.

688
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,640
They messaged me pretty much within a 
minute of you saying that.

689
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:52,474
Ask Ethan if he forgot the Disneyland 
trip with 20 of his friends for his bar 

690
00:33:56,111 --> 00:33:58,090
Mitzvah.
Stole his money.

691
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,250
Huh?
Okay.

692
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,230
I didn't realize I was paying my own 
barbecue.

693
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,280
Great Book where there's more,
there's more.

694
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:07,114
I spent $5,000
on his bar Mitzvah and everything he 

695
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,170
got,
which wasn't very much,

696
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,093
went into his own bank account.
His memory is a bit off using his 

697
00:34:15,431 --> 00:34:17,320
parents for a laugh.
Shameful.

698
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,380
Using the parents back down.
I want to thank God used.

699
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,560
Your parents were alive and where are 
we?

700
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,463
Yeah,
there you heard it from Kyle gas 

701
00:34:30,421 --> 00:34:31,254
himself.
Mom,

702
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:31,980
mom,
mom,

703
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,060
mom,
mom.

704
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,953
If I can retort real fast and this is 
perfect because you cannot respond one 

705
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,093
me,
I'm not supposed to pay for my own Bar 

706
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,420
Mitzvah party.
Yeah,

707
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,263
I'm off on a madness.
Is that Oh I paid and then the money in 

708
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:48,420
the bank.
Uh,

709
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:49,973
she says it went into my college fund,
whatever that that's what they always 

710
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:57,390
say when they take your money college 
fund.

711
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,950
Okay.
You stole my money.

712
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,600
Well we got a lot to deal with.
Did you go to college after all?

713
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,800
I did.
Did you graduate?

714
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,100
Barely.
Cause Jack and I were in your graduating

715
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:08,934
class.
I barely graduated and all the only 

716
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:12,740
reason I did it was because I went to 
ucs.

717
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:17,220
See the most forgiving Santa Cruz world.
Really?

718
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:18,054
Yeah.
No grades.

719
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,350
Remember?
Well they changed that.

720
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,930
They changed that.
Some classes are still pass,

721
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:24,480
no pass.
But for the most part you get grades.

722
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,433
Oh.
But they are very not only liberal in 

723
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:30,900
spirit but also in their forgiveness of 
the grading system.

724
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,680
Yeah.
Learning.

725
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,543
Yeah.
Okay.

726
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,670
Yes.
Was it all teacher?

727
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,860
All the professors?
Hippies.

728
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,780
Yeah,
cause that's what I imagined.

729
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:44,760
Santa Cruz University.
A lot of a hacky sack.

730
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,873
Ultimate Frisbee.
That's well I will tell you a jack that 

731
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:54,900
they had the number one ultimate Frisbee
team and the nation.

732
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,490
That's no joe and you're right,
there was a lot of hacky sack as well on

733
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,900
the sidelines.
That would have been me.

734
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,340
Yeah,
I want to see it.

735
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,430
Do you have any video of a frasier 
falling off stage?

736
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,230
You do.
So coincidental that you asked me that.

737
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,343
Um,
I would love to see that as these guys 

738
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:13,494
were walking in,
the God vape is right outside the door 

739
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,063
and we had the ipad of Kelsey grammer 
falling off stage and so they hadn't 

740
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:20,210
seen this video.
So I,

741
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,243
I absolutely adore this.
Is he like giving a Ted talk here or 

742
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:26,280
something?
He's giving a on recovery.

743
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,680
Let's talk about acting.
He's very,

744
00:36:28,681 --> 00:36:32,490
see he's being very serious and uh,
well without further ado,

745
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,400
enjoy Kelsey grammer falls off stage.

746
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,883
Sure.
We have to smile world pretending I was 

747
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:44,061
a UN interpreter.
I think.

748
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,920
There you have it.
Do that one more time.

749
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,750
And my favorite way goes,
oh dear Lord.

750
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,330
I know cause I was laughing on top of 
the Oh dear Lord.

751
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:09,164
I think let's see it again.
Nasty problems like in character as 

752
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:15,920
frazier.
Wait,

753
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,030
you did it again.
I go back a little bit.

754
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:20,350
Yeah cause I really want to get,
I'm going to get with an interpreter.

755
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,040
You went interpreter.
How did not hurt him?

756
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:35,260
He just took a lot of town hall stage 
looks treachery.

757
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,123
Yeah.
We didn't like the front of the stage 

758
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:42,101
looking like it has jagged wouldn't fell
in between the wooden teeth.

759
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,440
Have you guys ever had any stage

760
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,273
malfunctions or any issues on stage was 
we were recently watching a collection 

761
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:52,570
of artists falling off stage and there's
a lot of help there by the look of it.

762
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:57,760
Well occasionally a fan will run up and 
and try to Hug Jack.

763
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,350
I think that's happened a couple of 
times.

764
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,650
Don't you remember the one though where 
I did have one?

765
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,350
You did and I think it was when we were 
out on tour with the beastie boys.

766
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:07,900
We were doing like uh,
we were rocking the vote.

767
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,933
Oh,
they were rocking the vote and we were 

768
00:38:10,091 --> 00:38:10,924
just sorta coming along time around,
we were opening up for the beast is an 

769
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,633
ena and I was like stomping across the 
stage and then I just like stopped in 

770
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:23,230
between too big.
Like you can also walk on top of the big

771
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,590
speakers that are out there.
Right.

772
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,433
Yeah.
And I like stopped in between speakers 

773
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:29,380
and I went down all the way to my hip.

774
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,150
No,
but uh,

775
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,850
the adrenaline bounced me right back up 
and I just,

776
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,090
I kept on rock and I'm pretending as 
though nothing happened.

777
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:37,924
And I think that might've prevented it 
from going viral was that I recovered 

778
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:42,124
too quickly,
but it was pretty intense and I came 

779
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:46,720
very close to breaking my hip.
One of the great,

780
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,573
you remember cones and one of the great 
falls we had during a show was our 

781
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:54,520
guitar player and he was shredding,
he was shredding the Electric Guitar.

782
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:59,521
So look to the heavens melting phases 
and he's walking back and many trips all

783
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:02,860
over again is just a direct kind of,
he had a,

784
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,620
he had to get right back up though and 
continue rocking.

785
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:07,210
He was,
do we have video videotape of that?

786
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,223
We should might be on youtube,
but luckily there's been no serious 

787
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:14,170
injuries on a tenacious detour.
That's good.

788
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,990
And when you fell,
were you,

789
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,670
were you like,
uh,

790
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,600
injured or you were just,
he came right back.

791
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:25,480
I was sore and bruised,
but now the show must go on and we had a

792
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:27,670
show the next day.
I think it was fine.

793
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,290
But yeah,
I felt it.

794
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,340
The dings and there's like,
there's this one video of Justin,

795
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,690
like there's just a straight up whole 
yeah,

796
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,420
on the stage.
And this poor guy,

797
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,190
right?
The biebs went down the hall.

798
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,053
Yeah.
Let me show you went down the rabbit 

799
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,344
hole and whole,
and I feel so bad for him because it's 

800
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,620
like,
what can you do?

801
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,780
Oh,
wearing a kilt.

802
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,853
He's wearing a lot of layers.
I don't know if it's really cold in 

803
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,320
there.
It's kind of got an axl rose thing go on

804
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:54,840
there.
Yup.

805
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,673
Yeah.
And so Bob's your uncle in bye bye 

806
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,640
birdie.
Oh God.

807
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:07,200
The anticipation.
Oh God,

808
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,620
no.
Why would there be a hole there?

809
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,340
Why would there be a hole

810
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,400
guy?
I fell so bad,

811
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,303
man.
Cool.

812
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,873
Like he never had a chance.
He's got to get an accident lawyer for 

813
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:20,930
that cause he's got it nick deep though.

814
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,480
Play that for you again.
But yeah,

815
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,373
he goes all the way down.
It's never quite as serious when you 

816
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,020
weigh 112 pounds.
Dot.

817
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,950
Right,
right.

818
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,980
Nothing really hurts.
That's not the normal stage.

819
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,043
And then,

820
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,383
oh man.
That last step was a doozy that had to 

821
00:40:39,631 --> 00:40:40,464
be like for an effect or something like,
well these dancers popping up through 

822
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,540
the hole,
but there's the best of clothes.

823
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,670
That's how you got it.
You got to cloquet.

824
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,840
Yeah,
you've got to close the hole.

825
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,220
How often?
But he knows the clothes,

826
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,220
the whole,
everybody knows.

827
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,680
Everybody knows.
There's something I heard about you that

828
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:57,840
I,
that I found was interesting.

829
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,820
I was thinking about,
as you said,

830
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,070
we,
we both had this experience.

831
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,173
We turned 13,
and we said smell your later to the 

832
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:05,790
Jews.
Yeah.

833
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,713
But since you've had kids,
I've heard that you've returned to 

834
00:41:09,421 --> 00:41:10,620
synagogue.
Well,

835
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,483
I did feel like it was important for 
them to feel part of a community and I 

836
00:41:15,301 --> 00:41:18,320
wanted them to have that experience.
And uh,

837
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,163
we did have them enrolled in a school 
that had Hebrew studies as part of the 

838
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:27,770
curriculum so it wouldn't feel like they
had to go to extra school afterschool.

839
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,940
Hmm.
Um,

840
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,980
but it wasn't a good fit for the boy.
We were there for a few years.

841
00:41:31,981 --> 00:41:33,770
This is a good school.
But,

842
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,210
um,
God,

843
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:36,044
uh,
Dan actually so much stress dude is 

844
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:40,490
figuring out the right school for our 
kids.

845
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:45,590
I've spent so much time and energy and 
just like anxiety over this part.

846
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:49,430
I had no idea being a parent could be so
hard.

847
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,930
You thought it was going to become a 
public school,

848
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,650
public school just,
well,

849
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,750
what's wrong with the public?
Well,

850
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:56,310
what's wrong with public school?
Um,

851
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,640
it doesn't feel like our society puts 
enough energy towards public education.

852
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:05,870
Well,
there are tragically,

853
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,913
I feel like even though it's not fair,
I feel like I have to use the resources 

854
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:12,161
that,
that,

855
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:17,120
that we have at our disposal to give our
kids the best possible education.

856
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,350
And that unfortunately does not include 
public school ad this time.

857
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,473
So,
and is it a problem for your kids being 

858
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,190
a,
does it cause issues for them being your

859
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:30,500
son?
Does that ever,

860
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,420
yeah,
that is a factor too.

861
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,261
Interesting.
It's,

862
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:34,280
uh,
you know,

863
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,470
uh,
when,

864
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,820
when everybody knows who your,
your father is,

865
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:44,180
that's kind of a weird situation for 
them to be in.

866
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:49,181
And then to not know if like their 
friends or friends because they're,

867
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,460
yeah.
That's complicated for it.

868
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,360
It's hard enough for an adult.
I mean,

869
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,920
yeah.
But,

870
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:56,330
uh,
I think my boys are,

871
00:42:56,331 --> 00:43:00,860
are relatively well adjusted and it was 
actually my son Sammy,

872
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:03,280
who turned me onto your show.
Oh yeah.

873
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:08,630
Low three h three.
How old is he?

874
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,210
He's 12,
but he's sharp.

875
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,550
Very advanced.
Very advanced.

876
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,710
Tammy,
thank you so much.

877
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,130
I always take sam his advice and he's 
given me,

878
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,860
he's given me lots of golden nuggets 
over the years.

879
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,143
And,
uh,

880
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,580
and uh,
and Kyle's always like,

881
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:25,970
Hey,
wait,

882
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,830
how did you hear about this thing that 
we're doing today?

883
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,660
It's always Sammy,
Sammy,

884
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,390
you've been on,
you've been on good mythical morning and

885
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:33,530
you've been on hot.
Were both,

886
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,370
were those all families?
Examine Samsung is giving you good.

887
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,750
He needs to be your manager.
The best shows.

888
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,360
Well,
I believe that children are,

889
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,180
well,
hold on,

890
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:45,014
back up.

891
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,913
My glasses have a tendency to fog up.
I'm a hot and steamy guy by nature and 

892
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:52,814
sometimes it bothers me and I'll just go
up here for a little while and let them 

893
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:58,820
cool off and then I'll bring them back.
You did it kind of without your hands,

894
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:00,380
which I thought was pretty cool.
Yeah.

895
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:02,150
Well I can bring him down without my 
hands.

896
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:03,710
I can't get them back.
Get them up there.

897
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,130
That would be something that we then had
really business,

898
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,403
well,
the reason we've been thinking about it 

899
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:12,980
is because I'm pregnant.
Oh really?

900
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:16,850
Yes.
They got a little thing happening.

901
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,760
Yeah,
it's exciting.

902
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,390
So we know.
Do we have any idea what's,

903
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:23,240
uh,
what's coming up?

904
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,850
We think we haven't said that yet,
but I don't mind saying we will that the

905
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:30,500
person who did the ultrasound,
they go,

906
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,820
if I had to guess do,
they said,

907
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:33,450
do you want my guests?

908
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,283
I was like,
Oh yeah,

909
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,740
it says I love that move and you do it 
so casually.

910
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,990
There wasn't also,
there is a button on it.

911
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,180
Did you see that?
So it was like boom,

912
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:45,060
look at that.
It's like I'm ready for business.

913
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:47,970
Wow.
I felt like they were default enough but

914
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:48,804
I was wrong.
I actually need like some sauce and a 

915
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:52,800
cloth because they're,
they're being on.

916
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,370
You need to defrost or like a little fan
inside or something.

917
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,200
I'm going to use the phone crazy.
Someone rescue our little,

918
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,900
our little troublemaker.
Um,

919
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:05,680
the ultrasound guys?
Yes.

920
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:08,600
The ultrasound take a guess.
I'm not sure.

921
00:45:08,601 --> 00:45:11,340
But uh,
it looks like a,

922
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:15,030
it looks like a girl really.
Well that is not what they said.

923
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:15,893
Oh,
they said they saw little tiny little 

924
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:20,190
baby penis and they thought it was a guy
that's a tip off.

925
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,290
But I don't know.

926
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,490
I,
cause she's like,

927
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,970
well technically the next ultrasound is 
when you find out,

928
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:31,830
but if you want my opinion at one angle 
I saw a little penis,

929
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:38,780
which was kind of at another angle.
You saw your angle.

930
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,710
I couldn't tell what I was looking now.
I mean the ultra stays early.

931
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:47,544
Ultrasounds are so crazy because there's
like so much space and the babies just 

932
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:53,004
like floating around and she's doing 
this thing where she's putting on 

933
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,270
pushing on the stomach and the baby's 
like,

934
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,643
like uh,
an eight ball and an eight ball and has 

935
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:03,450
shaken the eight ball and it's like 
constant around.

936
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,460
It's crazy.
Yeah.

937
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,473
So it's a little boy.
We think Theodore Theodore already know 

938
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,340
you already met him.
How do you know?

939
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,080
I feel it.
Yeah,

940
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,960
I feel that I'm would call him theo.
We were okay with it.

941
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,870
Yeah.
I like,

942
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:18,721
yeah,
I'm fine.

943
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:20,590
I'm great with that.
I like Sierra.

944
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:25,290
There it is.
So we've been wondering what we would do

945
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,650
as far as Jewish,
the whole Jewish thing,

946
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:31,620
because we're not like religious,
right?

947
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,820
But it is a way of growing up during the
holidays and also a barn.

948
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:40,950
They speak Hebrew cause your family,
but the extra,

949
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,353
the extra schools is just so brutal.
I didn't know it's extra because they 

950
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:46,824
don't teach,
they don't teach Hebrew with public 

951
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:48,570
school.
I tell you that.

952
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,683
No Sir.
I felt like there was something to be 

953
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:57,280
gained also from the,
the,

954
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,880
the moral fabric that you get with,
uh,

955
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,840
with,
uh,

956
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,250
with Judaism.
And just in general when you have that,

957
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:07,080
uh,
that cradle of,

958
00:47:07,081 --> 00:47:09,150
uh,
it's a culture that's,

959
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,820
that's an identity.
And I very much identify,

960
00:47:11,821 --> 00:47:13,590
I think I come from the same.
Yeah.

961
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,290
I'm very much a cultural Jew,
you know,

962
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,160
it is.
What,

963
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,051
what,
what is your,

964
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:20,190
what's going on with you?
What are you,

965
00:47:20,191 --> 00:47:21,024
are you well,
I think my mom tried to cover all the 

966
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:26,130
bases.
I think I was a,

967
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,470
what do you call it when you're a 
Christian,

968
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:32,440
you get baptized and she just sorta go 
Kevin to do that.

969
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:37,030
He's been case fine circumcision in 
there.

970
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,630
That's good.
So she mutilated my genitals.

971
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:41,860
Thanks mom.
No.

972
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,780
Um,
yeah.

973
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:45,190
And then at quickly,
uh,

974
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,083
and then nobody was interested in,
in church or anything and it was just 

975
00:47:48,971 --> 00:47:52,250
evolved into an atheist household 
evolved until eight.

976
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,020
Yeah.
I love that.

977
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:53,853
It's just,
yeah,

978
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,820
I gave up.
Do you regret being circumcised?

979
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:58,654
Because that is a debate that goes on 
today is that people are angry at their 

980
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:03,840
parents for circumstance.
Yeah.

981
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,180
Here's one right here.
You,

982
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:09,850
you wish that were made were made fine.
All the parts are working fine.

983
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,950
You don't do that whole like cleaning 
business.

984
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:14,800
It's just such a pilot who it is it,
but you don't know.

985
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,330
You don't have 40 miss it.
Yes.

986
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:17,164
You don't remember having,
I'm going to just take a chance on 

987
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,660
mutilate it sexually mutilating babies 
is not a good idea.

988
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,580
It's going to call it a leap of faith 
there.

989
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:25,180
I mean,
let's,

990
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,020
let's not do that at that one.
How can do that anytime on my own when I

991
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:29,741
make teen,
oh,

992
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:33,160
I don't want that for skin anymore.
Let me remove that.

993
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,170
I think it looks a little nicer.

994
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,260
Oh,
merry go.

995
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,540
Aesthetically I can,
I think my opinion,

996
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,180
I haven't noticed a drop off.
I don't have anything to compare it to,

997
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:47,140
but the quality of orgasms has been all 
good.

998
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:49,270
All light baby.
So wait a second,

999
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,350
maybe there's something maybe there.
Well,

1000
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,630
do you know what a lot of people get?
So for scan is complicated business.

1001
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:59,710
I've heard a lot of people who end up 
having to get there for skin removed and

1002
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:03,490
their adult life.
And that can be one of the most painful,

1003
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,780
awful like a circumcision apologists,
frankly.

1004
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,033
Because yeah,
the debate rages on because now we have 

1005
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:16,141
to decide if we're gonna do it right.
You really decisions.

1006
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,070
Have you asked your parents what,
what they think about it?

1007
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:21,963
Oh,
I'm sure.

1008
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:28,170
That fucking thing.
I know Jack do well.

1009
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,080
I don't know,
but I just,

1010
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,190
I liked the exuberance.
Yeah,

1011
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:37,090
you're a wild man.
Um,

1012
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,710
I say cut it off,
right?

1013
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:40,980
I say cut it off.
But uh,

1014
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,500
I want to ask you guys about,
first of all that hbo show,

1015
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:49,501
you guys did his beloved to me.
Still one of my favorite shows ever.

1016
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:51,723
Thanks man.
How do you,

1017
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,810
I mean you guys,
I mean,

1018
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:55,090
it stands the test of time.
It's hilarious.

1019
00:49:55,091 --> 00:49:57,040
It was at the time.
How do you,

1020
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,880
tell me about your guys' experience 
making that show.

1021
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:04,910
Think that we were ranked like 36 best 
hbo show by I think Hbo.

1022
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,150
Well it has 100% on rotten tomatoes to 
this day.

1023
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,580
Wow.
That's crazy.

1024
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:12,730
Well,
how could you not like,

1025
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:15,370
so it was like the Sopranos.

1026
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,170
Yeah.
Game of thrones checkout.

1027
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,473
You're,
you're the only real question is where 

1028
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:24,283
were we ranked in relation to flight of 
the conchords cause our whole blank gun 

1029
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:29,294
is great.
Somehow compete with the new generation 

1030
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:33,910
of tenacious d,
right.

1031
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,140
Ceiling Heights.
Are you friends with those guys?

1032
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:37,190
You know those guys?
Yeah.

1033
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,870
We are friends with them.
Even though we do,

1034
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,960
I think there was a pretend rivalry.
Yeah,

1035
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:46,813
that's what I try.
I think I was trying to stoke those 

1036
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:51,200
flames be the greatest thing.
It's good for business.

1037
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:52,034
If you can get a rivalry garden,
the more popular Burchard to fight off 

1038
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:00,500
and then I think they took it,
I think they might've taken it the wrong

1039
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:01,334
way.
Yeah.

1040
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,090
So,
well friendly beef turned to real beef.

1041
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,070
Well in their,
uh,

1042
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,600
in their first show,
they had a thing,

1043
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,443
a little sort of inside joke.
We don't know that this was flight of 

1044
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:16,400
the conchords that put this joke in to 
their episode.

1045
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,400
It could have been an art director.
It's such a small thing.

1046
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,700
But Kyle,
with his powerful lasers,

1047
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:27,110
scope eyes noticed that they had like a 
newspaper,

1048
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,840
right?
Is there an advertisement in a newspaper

1049
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:33,230
that someone's reading in an episode?
What does it say?

1050
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,620
It says tenacious done.
D Oh,

1051
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:40,160
walkodile dial done before except 
tenacious d.

1052
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,040
And if you read into that,
it's like tenacious is done.

1053
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,290
And we've took that very personally and 
ever since then.

1054
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,760
And then we spent the next 10 years,
I'm trying to get to do our festival,

1055
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,050
but we do,
we do.

1056
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,020
We do love the conchords.
Like they're uh,

1057
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,430
uh,
a subtler cuter younger.

1058
00:52:03,431 --> 00:52:05,740
He killed like,
you guys are horrible by,

1059
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:10,990
can I say thank you?
Sort of give a vibe like a,

1060
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:13,610
we're wizards.
You've arrived.

1061
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:20,620
I'd love to see the earth searching.
We're very furry.

1062
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,500
I love many furries.
Furries.

1063
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:29,470
It seems to be sweeping the nation.
Can you tell me army and here,

1064
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,500
let me,
well this,

1065
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:32,390
this first is best presented with 
photos,

1066
00:52:32,391 --> 00:52:36,590
but a furry think it's either go to 
flaming lips,

1067
00:52:36,591 --> 00:52:37,790
concerts.
Nope.

1068
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,713
Anybody.
So this might weird you out because 

1069
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,120
again,
people are sensitive.

1070
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,320
So these are people that dress up as 
critters.

1071
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,870
It's a sexual thing though,
isn't it?

1072
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:48,590
Isn't it part of it?

1073
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:50,530
As far as I know,
it is a sexual thing.

1074
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:51,364
So the aiding other furries,
they dress up as critters and they just 

1075
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,550
have orgies.
Really.

1076
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:57,410
As far as I'm aware,
that seems very,

1077
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,730
very me.
Correct me if I'm wrong,

1078
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,310
I may be representing them.
So Dan and Ian,

1079
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,144
please fact check me.
But it does seem to have a sexual 

1080
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:06,920
component.
I don't know what's the origin,

1081
00:53:06,921 --> 00:53:09,820
but the faces and I and I got a cute 
group there.

1082
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,350
You got to say that's,
and I think that they creep me out.

1083
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,680
There is a sexual component from what I 
understand.

1084
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:18,470
I don't know about orgies happening,
although,

1085
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:22,160
I mean we'll explain this Dan.
Yeah,

1086
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,540
I need to know what you don't know.
What is know why their,

1087
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:26,374
the bases have to be like Toronto.
It doesn't seem like their faces are a 

1088
00:53:29,011 --> 00:53:30,600
little creepy.
Yes,

1089
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:31,270
thank you.

1090
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:32,880
You will.
But if it's sexual,

1091
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:34,320
it's just a dry humping,
right?

1092
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,730
No,
they cut a hole.

1093
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:39,880
There's a hole like the Mormons,
like it's more like,

1094
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,510
it's gotta be like a Velcro flap now 
that sex,

1095
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,130
but I guess,
you know,

1096
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,983
I guess it's kind of Nice if you're 
attractive as a whole bunch of them 

1097
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:56,151
there thing and you don't know who's 
black open and who's fights flaps closed

1098
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,800
and there's a photo you don't know.
I guess if you're real ugly,

1099
00:54:01,801 --> 00:54:02,634
like uh,
you know myself and you've gone a Fox 

1100
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:07,404
outfit and you showed deck and maybe 
you've got a good one and your face 

1101
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:10,254
isn't that good,
then all of sudden you're like king of 

1102
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:14,430
the furries.
It works to your advantage.

1103
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,293
Right?
You think that's like 50% of the reason 

1104
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:20,460
why people go for maybe what you're kind
of hiding your identity.

1105
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:22,260
You can't really see everyone's kind of 
equal.

1106
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,093
And just in Nicaragua it's kind of like 
eyes wide shut but ridiculous if you 

1107
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:31,950
have to adopt a furry voice,
you know like her pet boy.

1108
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,153
Oh good.
They do that then do you guys know if 

1109
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:36,324
they talk [inaudible] I mean I know that
there is a role playing aspect so I 

1110
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:46,560
imagine that that Dan is saying,
yes,

1111
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:51,210
you're going to this length zoom.
You would assume the voice as well.

1112
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,880
Right?
Well I think we should go under cover.

1113
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:58,620
Well you paint your Dick reade like the 
red rocket.

1114
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:01,250
Not Often Jesus,
you know,

1115
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,310
awesome.
But they might just looked it up.

1116
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:09,450
I mean on their wikipedia about for 
these the sexual aspect,

1117
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,570
it's fairly far down in the article 
there.

1118
00:55:11,571 --> 00:55:14,940
There's quite a bit to the sub culture 
other than the sexual aspect.

1119
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,370
Although I will note that the sexual 
aspect,

1120
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:18,970
that is the biggest part of the article.

1121
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:22,260
So there you go.
These guys fuck like crazy.

1122
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,440
I think it's more about the cuddling 
really.

1123
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,970
I mean I think that's what that's about.
You want to get snugly?

1124
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,590
Yeah,
I got to get hot.

1125
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:33,270
And I think all the first watching her 
and being like,

1126
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,160
thank you jack.
Understand man.

1127
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:38,740
So ignorant.
Don't understand.

1128
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,190
Yeah.
Have to get their message out.

1129
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,330
So you guys created that show with,
um,

1130
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:48,360
I didn't know this until recently.
David Cross and Bob owed and Kurt,

1131
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,670
I mean,
what an incredible lineup.

1132
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,140
How'd you guys get a,
they should have,

1133
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,560
well,
they took us under their wing.

1134
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:56,583
Wow.
Our first ever show was a at a little 

1135
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:06,210
club that no longer exists in downtown 
La in [inaudible] 94,

1136
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,253
somewhere around there we played a place
called Al's bar and there was like 12 

1137
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:16,521
drunk hipsters in the audience and one 
of them was David Cross and he was like,

1138
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,480
you guys are Rad.

1139
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,060
Com,
uh,

1140
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:20,933
open for our thing.
We do a thing called Mr Show live at 

1141
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,660
clubs in,
in,

1142
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,900
in La comedy clubs and stuff.
And we're like,

1143
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:29,581
you know,
Oh yeah,

1144
00:56:29,581 --> 00:56:30,900
let's do it.
That sounds good.

1145
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:32,470
We had never heard of them,
but they,

1146
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,753
they had come out,
they had just finished working with Ben 

1147
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:36,963
Stiller on the Ben Stiller show and they
were starting this new thing called Mr 

1148
00:56:39,431 --> 00:56:40,840
Show.
And,

1149
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:41,674
uh,
and then they had already made a deal 

1150
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:46,950
with hbo to have their show,
Mr Show on the air.

1151
00:56:46,951 --> 00:56:47,784
And,
and they finagled a way for us to be on 

1152
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:54,040
Hbo too with short films that they 
helped us.

1153
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:54,550
Well,
Curtis,

1154
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,700
we were going to be part of their show.
Right.

1155
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,700
I remember.
And it's like,

1156
00:56:57,701 --> 00:56:58,534
wait a minute,
these guys don't really fit into our 

1157
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:00,514
show.
They should do their own little after 

1158
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:04,330
our show.
Little specialty.

1159
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:09,370
But first they,
I remember they took us to Aspen for the

1160
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,590
Hbo Comedy Festival and that was very 
exciting.

1161
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,320
Yeah.
Amazing.

1162
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:14,950
Owed.
And Kirk is like,

1163
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:16,563
has a rep.
I mean he also kind of gave Tim and 

1164
00:57:18,221 --> 00:57:19,054
Eric,
they're big.

1165
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:19,810
Yeah.
Well,

1166
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,240
which is just incredible.
Yeah.

1167
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,430
That's a great,
uh,

1168
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,333
mentor.
Both of those guys are huge forces in 

1169
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:27,454
comedy,
but they're kind of like under the 

1170
00:57:29,021 --> 00:57:31,450
radar.
Yeah.

1171
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,180
But a great like,
well,

1172
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,380
that was great.
Great advocates for people.

1173
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:37,750
I find that so awesome.
Totally.

1174
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:40,270
It's great to see Bob just bust out in 
the,

1175
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,533
in the sole role.
I now take over the famous for being on 

1176
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:47,320
better call Saul,
but he was before that,

1177
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:47,891
it was like,
oh,

1178
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:48,491
bob.
I mean,

1179
00:57:48,491 --> 00:57:51,190
he's always doing so many great things,
but yeah.

1180
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:52,024
How was that watching him have a 
breakout and like the breaking bad 

1181
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:54,461
world?
I mean,

1182
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:55,810
he's,
and he's so good.

1183
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:56,863
Yeah.
I think he's just a dramatic actor now 

1184
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,580
really.
I mean that he's just taken in onto that

1185
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:01,893
so amazingly and he's,
he's getting other parts to left and 

1186
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:05,170
right.

1187
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:06,910
Well each rose,
but for me it's,

1188
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:10,180
I always think if that is like a little 
side thing that he's done,

1189
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:12,820
I don't think of that as the main part 
of him.

1190
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:16,630
The main part of Bob Odenkirk is genius 
comedic.

1191
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:20,310
Mine came out of SNL.
He was one of the riders staff on,

1192
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:23,000
on snl just as a rider.
And uh,

1193
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:24,780
and uh,
uh,

1194
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:25,923
yeah,
everything that he touched seemed to 

1195
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,920
turn to gold.
He and,

1196
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:31,763
and uh,
we were really lucky to cross paths 

1197
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:35,770
with,
with him and David Cross.

1198
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,530
They we in a way they,
we owe them everything.

1199
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:42,010
They gave us our big break.
They gave us the big break.

1200
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,173
So I recommend if you are trying to 
break into the industry or in the 90s 

1201
00:58:47,681 --> 00:58:49,450
and you're trying to break into,
I'll just try to help me.

1202
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:50,284
How impressed Bob and David Jack as I 
understand it from a mutual friend of 

1203
00:58:55,061 --> 00:58:56,710
ours,
you are also an advocate.

1204
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,560
I have.
So I have a surprise,

1205
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:01,170
somewhat of a surprise.
I'm like,

1206
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,043
God is,
am I going to be surprised by someone 

1207
00:59:03,371 --> 00:59:05,380
from a blast,
from my past going to enter the room?

1208
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,750
I think so.
No,

1209
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:07,683
I'm really excited.
A friend of mine reached out because he 

1210
00:59:10,181 --> 00:59:13,570
heard you were going to be on the show 
and I don't know that you've seen this,

1211
00:59:13,571 --> 00:59:15,340
he said,
but I think that you will be,

1212
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,830
you'll be joined by it.
Wow.

1213
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,660
You will be joined by,
you will be joined by.

1214
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,690
It's like,
it's never been like this is an issue.

1215
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,020
So hang on.
Here we go.

1216
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,030
Tell me if you've ever met.
Recognize this.

1217
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,230
Oh my God,
it's Justin reuland.

1218
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:30,920
Yeah.
Oh my God.

1219
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,330
So speaking of genius,
so Justin Reuland,

1220
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:41,110
Jack Black helped Justin reuland pitch 
and sell his first show as eap.

1221
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:43,123
Wow.
Jack helped Justin get his foot in the 

1222
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:47,670
door.
No.

1223
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,340
Well,
and by the way,

1224
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,490
well Justin reached out and he's like,
Jack is amazing.

1225
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,230
He helped me and he believed in me and I
just want to say hi and thank you.

1226
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,630
Ah,
and that he loves it.

1227
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,010
What a mench.
Well,

1228
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:03,410
let me see because you did a little 
cameo in this.

1229
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:05,570
His,
this is the first show he ever sold.

1230
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:06,883
Here's your little cameo,
but she says the funniest part of the 

1231
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:09,130
show.

1232
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:09,963
It comes up after this.

1233
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:17,330
This is unfair.
This is juicy threat drag.

1234
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,420
Hey Mitchell has a zone and coming along
over here.

1235
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:28,210
What the Hell's going on?
I ride,

1236
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:29,720
I ride.
Mitchell.

1237
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,030
This isn't the jingle.
He winks time.

1238
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:32,864
It's a job.
Now get back to weight plates that 

1239
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,930
accent.
God,

1240
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:41,990
I love eating maggots out of dead 
animals.

1241
01:00:41,991 --> 01:00:44,090
I love it.
I do it all the time.

1242
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,340
I'm proud of it too.
I show it off.

1243
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,233
It makes me unique comp.
Nobody seems to care that I do it at 

1244
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:51,374
work.
Either.

1245
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,130
You'd think they would consider when I 
work in a grocery store,

1246
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:59,180
but they don't let me do as I please 
listen to me.

1247
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:01,310
Go on.
Tara and I are character.

1248
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,670
I should get my own spinoff show.
I'd be huge.

1249
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,870
Everybody had loved me.
Pull,

1250
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,280
pull,
pull,

1251
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:07,960
pull,
pull,

1252
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,793
pull,
pull.

1253
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,820
I forgot all about that.

1254
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:21,910
Got,
I think was from,

1255
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:23,220
I think

1256
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,650
it was from the early two thousands am I
right,

1257
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:28,650
but really he had shows coming out his 
ears.

1258
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:31,590
He was creating amazing content all over
the place.

1259
01:01:31,591 --> 01:01:34,440
I,
I don't really think that was a stepping

1260
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:35,274
stone.
It was the first show he ever sold 

1261
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,050
thanks to you.
You went around with him.

1262
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:40,620
He,
he peed it.

1263
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:44,663
Oh we did.
We did a little tenacious d thing with 

1264
01:01:47,281 --> 01:01:48,114
Justin when Ireland time fixers,
but justin had tons of people that 

1265
01:01:53,821 --> 01:01:57,180
believed in him and we're looking for 
opportunities to work with him.

1266
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,460
By the way,
another photo I want to show you,

1267
01:01:59,461 --> 01:02:00,780
you're being modest,
but he's,

1268
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,250
this is what he told me.
Okay,

1269
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,080
look,
I couldn't you leave.

1270
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:09,160
He sent me this photo last night,
blow doors down while he's a saver saved

1271
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:15,910
stuff like that horse.
But I can't believe how young this is,

1272
01:02:17,731 --> 01:02:20,010
like history.
I mean this was a beautiful,

1273
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:21,780
brought us together.

1274
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,480
It was all about Dan Harmon and rob 
shrub.

1275
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:26,400
They do that.
They did that thing.

1276
01:02:26,401 --> 01:02:29,970
A Channel One o one which was a 
competitive short film,

1277
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:31,363
uh,
Charlotte thing that they did once a 

1278
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:37,980
month on the youtubes and a yeah,
all kinds of creative types.

1279
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:40,170
Like Justin all came out of that.
Yeah.

1280
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,060
But he told me this was at a,
um,

1281
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:43,583
Mr show.
He was just there in the audience at Mr 

1282
01:02:46,261 --> 01:02:47,580
Shell.
Yeah.

1283
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:48,443
And this,
he just got to meet you randomly as a 

1284
01:02:49,801 --> 01:02:50,880
fan.
Yeah,

1285
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,620
no,
those were the places to be.

1286
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:53,454
Back in 90 11,
you wanted to be at the tapings of Mr 

1287
01:02:57,331 --> 01:02:59,010
Show.
It felt like,

1288
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,750
uh,
you know,

1289
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,650
they were the nirvana of the alts comedy
scene thing.

1290
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:05,543
They,
they,

1291
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,420
and at least to see it'd be seen.
That's right.

1292
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:11,670
Well here you have it.
I love this photo.

1293
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,271
This,
I mean,

1294
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:13,550
this is amazing.
Amazing.

1295
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,300
I got to frame this and put it on the 
wall.

1296
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,230
So,
um,

1297
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,580
that was hard.
I wanted to ask.

1298
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,260
We have questions from fans.
Oh,

1299
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:23,011
nice.
Yes.

1300
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:25,110
We have some questions from our fans.
Noise,

1301
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,630
take them live.
We do not take them live.

1302
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,450
You vet them.
They were posted on our,

1303
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,940
on our subreddit,
on a fan forum.

1304
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:38,280
So let me allow me to read some to you.
This one comes from pj four,

1305
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:38,761
two,
four,

1306
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:39,880
two.
Uh,

1307
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,520
this one's for you,
Jack.

1308
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,640
What was the Eric Andre interview like?
Did,

1309
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:45,623
did you know what you're getting 
yourself into and were there any 

1310
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:48,600
surprises?

1311
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,301
Well,
yeah,

1312
01:03:49,301 --> 01:03:50,134
I knew what I was getting into in that 
I'm a huge fan of Eric Andre and I knew 

1313
01:03:54,491 --> 01:03:55,324
it was going to be some sick shit.
And I was a little nervous about it 

1314
01:03:57,441 --> 01:03:59,320
because I was like,
is he going to treat me bad?

1315
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,120
But he,
he,

1316
01:04:01,121 --> 01:04:04,540
uh,
it was what you'd expect.

1317
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:10,260
It was about 112 degrees on the set by 
design to make me uncomfortable.

1318
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:13,410
I was sweating profusely.
Uh,

1319
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:17,050
it smelled horrible.
And then I found out why later they were

1320
01:04:17,051 --> 01:04:22,051
boiling hot.
Rodding a squid carcasses underneath the

1321
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,300
floor boards.
Uh,

1322
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:26,650
and there was also some,
uh,

1323
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,060
some surprises.
Uh,

1324
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:31,300
here's a little bit of a electroshock 
therapy.

1325
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:36,100
Every time we did a lie detector tests,
in a way it was torture,

1326
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:37,323
but it was also like a rite of passage.
I felt like it was a late Bar Mitzvah 

1327
01:04:41,081 --> 01:04:45,310
for me if I could survive the Eric Andre
experience.

1328
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,453
And,
uh,

1329
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:48,320
uh,
uh,

1330
01:04:48,321 --> 01:04:50,120
I loved it.
It was so funny.

1331
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,133
It was really weird.
Like the soda come in or the coffee 

1332
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:55,220
coming out.
That was pure surprise.

1333
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:59,580
My plan was to try to just approach it 
like any other talk show.

1334
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:04,280
Like I'm going on Conan O'brien now and 
do like a funny little entrance like I,

1335
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,390
I usually do.

1336
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:10,550
And then just descend into hell.
Yeah.

1337
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:12,110
Oh Man.
Yeah.

1338
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,283
It's great.
I highly recommend it if you get a 

1339
01:05:16,301 --> 01:05:18,340
chance to,
to embrace

1340
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,173
the madness.

1341
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,130
Yeah.
That is eric on.

1342
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,970
I love it.
And I was so happy to see you there.

1343
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:25,930
Uh,
this one comes from incendiary war pig.

1344
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,180
Oh,
uh,

1345
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,023
which tenacious d song do you guys most 
enjoy performing and how many cockup 

1346
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,810
Cock pushups can you do today?
Often asked.

1347
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,090
Oh,
off to ask questions in there.

1348
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,050
The cockroach up.
And the answer,

1349
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,890
the real answer is you only need to do 
one.

1350
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:45,980
That's right.
Yeah.

1351
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:53,470
Can you still do one though?
I'm afraid I,

1352
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:55,390
uh,
I can't have,

1353
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,650
you cannot have more out there.

1354
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,790
Uh,
I can,

1355
01:05:58,850 --> 01:05:59,683
I can do a partial,
but it's like a granny pushup there has 

1356
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:06,200
to be there.
It has to be from the knees and I do all

1357
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:08,510
that little hub,
but I can still get there.

1358
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,230
What song do you like to play the most?
You know,

1359
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,070
it's always fun to,
uh,

1360
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:16,880
to,
uh,

1361
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:17,713
to play the crowd pleasers,
but it's one of the deep cuts that I 

1362
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:24,380
enjoy the most.
I think it is a throw down.

1363
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:27,620
I know that in the funnel and it's got 
a,

1364
01:06:27,621 --> 01:06:29,720
it's got some biblical references in 
there.

1365
01:06:29,721 --> 01:06:34,721
We kind of go deep and it's about the,
the dangers of,

1366
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:39,920
of blindly following a organized 
religions and about how it could,

1367
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:43,640
it could end up being the,
the end of the world for all of us.

1368
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:47,930
The Battle of the three major,
uh,

1369
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,003
you start with the Judaism.
Moses came down from the hill and then 

1370
01:06:53,451 --> 01:06:57,490
you go to Jesus and then you go to the 
one that you can't say,

1371
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,780
did he say his name,
his date in the song?

1372
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,820
The three of them end up battling in the
rain.

1373
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:10,290
The world is completely insane sounding.
Alarm bombs.

1374
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,150
Crazy.
Wait,

1375
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:12,983
fuck.
I said what I wrote down was what was 

1376
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:15,464
that song about originally?
Remember we kind of tweaked a little 

1377
01:07:17,301 --> 01:07:18,134
bit.
I remember,

1378
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:19,431
Oh yeah,
no,

1379
01:07:19,431 --> 01:07:21,970
we had the jam for,
for,

1380
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:24,710
for months and we didn't know what the 
lyrics would be.

1381
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:26,710
And then we finally realized this.
Champions.

1382
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,070
So have,
it's important.

1383
01:07:28,071 --> 01:07:28,904
It's an important jam is his needs toss 
to hit that we leave with the big guns 

1384
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:36,190
we're going after.
What was it about before that?

1385
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:42,850
One line is we're clowns,
but we do like to get serious sometimes.

1386
01:07:43,401 --> 01:07:47,330
And maybe that's that those are the most
fun ones when we tackle real issues,

1387
01:07:47,331 --> 01:07:47,850
you know?

1388
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:49,800
Yeah.
Well I that makes me think,

1389
01:07:49,801 --> 01:07:52,020
cause I was watching post apocalypto 
sorry.

1390
01:07:52,021 --> 01:07:52,854
Yeah,
fair for me to ask any question was 

1391
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:57,930
spreading that swollen too and yeah,
I want that dog part of the flavor,

1392
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:03,080
but I don't think he's hypoallergenic.
One of my book that's not first,

1393
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:04,434
that's like,
Hey,

1394
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:05,790
fair.
He gets hair.

1395
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:10,020
Oh my God.
What a come home he has.

1396
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,300
He doesn't shed.
He's a Yorkshire terrier.

1397
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:19,140
Hypo allergenic.
Should we,

1398
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,200
should we get a Yorkshire Shampoo?
Sammy,

1399
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:23,870
if you,
if you trust my word at all.

1400
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:26,270
Are you allergic to the Dander?
I'm not,

1401
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,333
but,
but the non shedding is like beautiful 

1402
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:29,654
because they're so clean.
He literally shares a pillow with us at 

1403
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:36,170
night and I have a good place I can 
recommend to,

1404
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:39,440
if you want to get a similar breed,
I'll tell you off there.

1405
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:40,970
That'd be great.
They're close by.

1406
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:42,403
Yeah.
Let's not say that on the air because 

1407
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:45,050
then there'll be all save the puppies.
Yeah.

1408
01:08:45,051 --> 01:08:48,230
You don't pick up the litter.
I'm swear.

1409
01:08:48,231 --> 01:08:51,830
I need to get a rescue.
Do you know how many dogs need homes?

1410
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:54,410
Oh,
this guy needs a home.

1411
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:55,791
Well,
I'm just saying,

1412
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:57,590
I'm just preparing you.
Kyle's right,

1413
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,640
there will be some hate mail back.
I talk about like,

1414
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,820
you know,
not getting it because I've talked about

1415
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:08,120
it a lot in this because I listen,
we're listening.

1416
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:12,440
I thank you now I'm now I feel stressed 
that everybody's listening.

1417
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,810
This dog needs a home.
Yeah.

1418
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:18,440
What about the dogs that need homes?
Need homes?

1419
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,030
All right.
You can keep a thank you.

1420
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,130
Well,
you know I love him.

1421
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:27,730
He's like my son and when people,
you know,

1422
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,540
they're,
they're all are people that are get a,

1423
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:31,980
I crawl into your heart.
They didn't strange about but,

1424
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,610
and I do think adopting is wonderful,
beautiful thing.

1425
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,860
But I've got an ultimate hookup of pure 
bred,

1426
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:40,120
beautiful paper,
paper papers.

1427
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:42,110
They got papers,
real allergies.

1428
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:43,850
You,
you gotta you gotta be careful.

1429
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:47,030
So,
but uh,

1430
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:48,310
you were about to ask us.
Yes,

1431
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,700
my dog,
uh,

1432
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:52,933
interrupted.
I was asking cause you were saying you 

1433
01:09:54,241 --> 01:09:57,110
like to get real about certain things 
and I was wondering,

1434
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:59,750
well while I was watching post 
apocalypto,

1435
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:03,500
do you guys think that we are on the 
verge of a apocalypse here?

1436
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:07,190
Is that some kind of reaction to 
something you're seeing in the world?

1437
01:10:07,191 --> 01:10:09,020
One hopes not sure.
Of course.

1438
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:09,950
We're one hopes.
Yeah.

1439
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,060
Oops.
Oh

1440
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:12,681
yeah.
I mean that,

1441
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:13,600
that was,
uh,

1442
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:17,190
that was the impetus to do post 
apocalyptic.

1443
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:18,520
We felt like,
Hey,

1444
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:21,220
this is,
this is going south real fast.

1445
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:22,590
This,
this guy who's our,

1446
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:24,810
uh,
the leader of our country is,

1447
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:27,640
is the spew and a lot of hate.
Weird.

1448
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:28,474
It's scary.
And it feels like this is what happens 

1449
01:10:30,431 --> 01:10:33,250
right before some kind of a worldwide 
catastrophe.

1450
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:37,450
This is the kind of talk that you hear 
right before World War.

1451
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:38,723
And,
uh,

1452
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,710
so we were like,
we need to do post apocalypse

1453
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:44,690
to,
to save the world.

1454
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:48,650
That's what we were thinking as we see.
We're still here.

1455
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,370
So you're welcome.
You're welcome.

1456
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:53,780
Well,
there was a scene where you guys cut off

1457
01:10:53,781 --> 01:10:56,180
Donald Trump junior's penis.
No,

1458
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,040
not true or no,
you're right.

1459
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,390
It was a,
you're right,

1460
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:02,780
you guys were very delicate about that 
actually got a tremendous Bj,

1461
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:07,060
he got it to reach a so good that it was
removed from him or we're,

1462
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:07,850
no,
no,

1463
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:08,683
the Bj,
Bj is just like the best Bj of all time 

1464
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:13,980
and we use that as a distraction so that
we can

1465
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,670
get the source of all of his power.
The crystal of Gilgamesh,

1466
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:18,600
right.
Uh,

1467
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:23,490
and then we are discovered and then he 
sends his attack dogs.

1468
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:28,730
He sends a Nazis KKK and a demon from 
hell,

1469
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:31,440
of course,
known as the Gorgonzola.

1470
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:32,274
What's his name?

1471
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:37,600
The goal God.
And then a spoiler alert.

1472
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:40,000
I'm not going to tell you anymore,
but what happens then?

1473
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:43,090
But there is no penis removal,
but there is.

1474
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,073
Oh,
right.

1475
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:45,850
His penis is intact.
Yes.

1476
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,510
His penis and his penis is,
is well featured in the episode.

1477
01:11:49,511 --> 01:11:52,120
It does turn into a mushroom cloud.
Spoiled.

1478
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:52,973
Oh,
I do.

1479
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,770
I pause it as like Isla,
we have to wash this again.

1480
01:11:56,950 --> 01:12:01,090
There's one dissolve in this feature 
film that you guys need to watch.

1481
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:06,010
Is that when a tip of a penis dissolves 
into a mushroom cloud?

1482
01:12:06,011 --> 01:12:07,440
Yes.
Wow.

1483
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:08,303
You know,
the Academy Awards and there are going 

1484
01:12:09,851 --> 01:12:13,090
to use that as part of the montage.
Well,

1485
01:12:13,091 --> 01:12:17,560
and of course just a reminder what,
let me just borrow your magazine.

1486
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:18,423
Oh No.
That tenacious D and post apocalypto is 

1487
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:25,840
in consideration for best picture.
It's just an honor to be nominated.

1488
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,150
It's an honor to be considered 
considered.

1489
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:29,710
Well,
I mean that's all.

1490
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:32,200
I don't know who took that out of,
but thank you.

1491
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,830
Whoever that was,
uh,

1492
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:37,570
yeah.
Honor to pay for your own,

1493
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,610
for your consideration.
Yes.

1494
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:42,773
Well,
I'm considering you guys you're 

1495
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:46,000
considering,
um,

1496
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,630
but you know,
we,

1497
01:12:47,631 --> 01:12:48,464
we,
uh,

1498
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:50,040
we drew that,
uh,

1499
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,033
that sequence before we even knew that 
donald trump's penis was shaped like a 

1500
01:12:56,021 --> 01:12:58,390
mushroom.
And that was in a way,

1501
01:12:58,391 --> 01:12:59,201
it was like a no,
sir.

1502
01:12:59,201 --> 01:13:00,034
Domus moment.

1503
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:02,770
Art Imitating life because it's not on 
senior.

1504
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,670
Oh,
it's life and it's hitting all right.

1505
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,880
We didn't know he was imitating,
I don't know.

1506
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:10,040
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1507
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:11,143
yeah.
But all the penises were very lovingly 

1508
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:18,161
crafted in this series.
Elon musk was Ilan glass.

1509
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:19,600
Danielle is

1510
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,570
it?
Yeah.

1511
01:13:20,571 --> 01:13:21,404
Is featured in there.
I don't know why we talk so much about 

1512
01:13:23,961 --> 01:13:27,370
Ilan Musk and that third episode,
it's just a,

1513
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,700
well,
of course he got highs.

1514
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,380
If you're talking about who's going to 
survive the lock lips,

1515
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:32,283
of course,
the super wealthy and the super to 

1516
01:13:34,691 --> 01:13:35,524
Branson Genius engineers,
we'll find a way to end up on the hill 

1517
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,030
who would end up there.
But,

1518
01:13:41,031 --> 01:13:41,990
um,
you know,

1519
01:13:41,991 --> 01:13:44,720
a big part of it also when we're making 
it was that,

1520
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:46,290
uh,
uh,

1521
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:51,340
we felt like we understood the psychosis
that is donald trump's the,

1522
01:13:53,031 --> 01:13:53,864
the,
the,

1523
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:54,853
the phenomenon that is his astronomic 
rise to power because we have a little 

1524
01:13:59,271 --> 01:14:02,810
seed of his disease too.
It's called,

1525
01:14:02,811 --> 01:14:03,980
what is it called,
Kyle.

1526
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:06,200
Oh,
a grandiosity.

1527
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,170
Narcissism,
narcissism,

1528
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,270
narcissistic,
egotistical,

1529
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,460
uh,
disorder.

1530
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,460
Uh,
because we,

1531
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,480
we,
uh,

1532
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:17,623
have made our whole careers on this 
thing about saying we're the greatest 

1533
01:14:20,501 --> 01:14:22,150
band in the world.
Uh,

1534
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:25,600
everything flows through us.
We are the best band ever.

1535
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:26,434
And our,
our biggest hit song was the first song 

1536
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:29,920
we ever wrote,
uh,

1537
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:30,754
the greatest song in the world tribute.
And so when we see this guy coming out 

1538
01:14:34,001 --> 01:14:34,580
and he'll go,
oh,

1539
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:35,413
good winning,
I'm in the best of movement of we know 

1540
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:39,760
that scam,
that he's planned,

1541
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:41,680
that Shell,
but he's not joking.

1542
01:14:41,681 --> 01:14:43,850
That's the only difference.
And,

1543
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:44,783
and then I,
and then I started to think about other 

1544
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:50,620
people in the industry who have made a 
huge career out of this.

1545
01:14:50,621 --> 01:14:51,454
And you think of like Howard Stern,
the king of all media and he's the best 

1546
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:56,760
and he's kind of joking,
but he's also kind of Nice,

1547
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:59,980
kind of got the narcissistic looking in 
the mirror all the time,

1548
01:14:59,981 --> 01:15:00,814
talking about how great he is.
And then you look around at other 

1549
01:15:02,471 --> 01:15:04,360
people.
You need to see like Kanye West,

1550
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:06,070
he's the greatest and he's,
you know,

1551
01:15:06,071 --> 01:15:11,071
creating and you see different people in
pop culture that I have this disease and

1552
01:15:11,771 --> 01:15:16,090
are succeeding because the world that we
live in now embraces it.

1553
01:15:16,091 --> 01:15:17,800
And they love it.
They love a narcissist.

1554
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,730
Hmm.
Uh,

1555
01:15:18,731 --> 01:15:19,481
and,
uh,

1556
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:20,314
it seems like particular to these times 
right now we are vulnerable to Psychos 

1557
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,880
who think they are the greatest thing.

1558
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:33,790
People are so accepting of this 
grandiose that people are like love that

1559
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:37,460
larger than life figure.
Is it all?

1560
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:38,383
Maybe it's always been like that.
But you had said like today people are 

1561
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:43,030
more accepting of it.
I wonder why that is.

1562
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,553
What do you think kyle?
Kyle knows all the answers to 

1563
01:15:46,211 --> 01:15:47,650
everything.
It's true.

1564
01:15:47,651 --> 01:15:48,484
I do.
I just doing a nicorette piece of gum 

1565
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,110
with this down over here.
Don't pay on the camera.

1566
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:57,640
He stole.
I'm just trying to think of an answer we

1567
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:01,720
talks about as nicotine gum.
I think that a celebrity is a,

1568
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,100
I'm kind of the uh,
the uh,

1569
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,970
the cachet of,
of modern society.

1570
01:16:07,971 --> 01:16:11,060
It seems like it's overly valued and I 
think,

1571
01:16:11,061 --> 01:16:11,894
uh,
I think Donald was spent 14 years being 

1572
01:16:15,021 --> 01:16:15,854
branded over and over again.
Is this kind of a super smart business 

1573
01:16:20,241 --> 01:16:21,074
guy self made.
And I think unfortunately that can 

1574
01:16:24,441 --> 01:16:26,270
really work.
And just repetition.

1575
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:29,700
I mean there's certain just kind of 
dynamics at work that,

1576
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,230
that we know that if you just keep 
repeating something over and over again,

1577
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:38,320
the pinnacle can marketing.
It is,

1578
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,430
I like the best marketing campaign ever.

1579
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:45,890
So anyway,
we thought it would be good to go.

1580
01:16:45,891 --> 01:16:46,724
Flash forward to the whole world has 
been destroyed by this mega maniacal 

1581
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:55,580
demon beast.
And uh,

1582
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:59,610
we have to pick up the pieces because 
all of the great movies in,

1583
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:04,660
in our opinion are the post apocalyptic 
science fiction masterpieces,

1584
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:08,130
road warrior,
uh,

1585
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:09,800
uh,
terminator,

1586
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:10,920
[inaudible]

1587
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,613
wizard of Oz.
These are the movies I think we can all 

1588
01:17:15,951 --> 01:17:20,951
agree objective are the best movies ever
made and they are warnings.

1589
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:24,300
They are like look out for the future.
And we wanted it,

1590
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:26,750
we wanted to jump into that sphere 
because not,

1591
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:31,780
not only because we love those movies 
but also because it seemed like what the

1592
01:17:32,061 --> 01:17:32,894
world needs now and only a narcissist 
could think that they could save the 

1593
01:17:36,321 --> 01:17:38,300
world.
And that's where [inaudible] comes in.

1594
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:43,510
We are the antidote to the demon because
we are the demon.

1595
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:48,610
Well I don't know where I'm talking 
about but it is court jesters.

1596
01:17:48,611 --> 01:17:53,611
Sort of pointing up.
Rice was very much like a road warrior,

1597
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:57,770
rock opera and it's on youtube.
It's at tenacious d.

1633
01:19:28,581 --> 01:19:29,414
