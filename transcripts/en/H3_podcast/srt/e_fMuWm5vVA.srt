video producer,

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,700
What artists are mean?
Artists,

9
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,790
most certainly.
How else is there any classification?

10
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:42,791
I missed a person person.
Let's not forget that.

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,170
Species.
Species.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,253
Animal.
Yeah.

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,870
How are you doing,
Greg?

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,011
Great.
Having,

15
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:49,750
you know,
Jesus.

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,990
Thank you.
So thank you for having me.

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,170
Thanks for.
Thank you.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,220
How was the uh,
how is it here in la?

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,280
It rained,
which is a typical,

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,353
I suppose.
I think it's kind of funny because it 

21
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:05,560
never rains in la.
And your logo is the umbrella here.

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,450
You come to Los Angeles and we brought 
the rain with you,

23
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:10,520
which in La is a miracle,
I would say.

24
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,103
Yeah.
So you are a miraculous young man who 

25
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,160
was very,
very nice of you.

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,150
Yeah.
Um,

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,920
our.
Tell me about,

28
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,420
I want to know about a.
okay,

29
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:27,254
well your first hit,
your first big hit was the penthouse 

30
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,030
where you're,
where you're looking in your timeline of

31
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:35,661
working.
What,

32
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:37,970
what were your first year?
People were like,

33
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:39,320
oh,
what's going on with bill works?

34
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,340
Well,
it's all relative,

35
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:41,750
but here's the thing.
It was like nobody,

36
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:45,530
nobody,
nothing until the going a million.

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,680
My floor got about 200 likes very 
quickly on vine,

38
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:52,580
which 200 compared to zero is like,
that's like what's happening,

39
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,080
right?
Yeah.

40
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,700
So,
but after that it was um,

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,643
school on fine,
I don't want to go to school and it was 

42
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,910
shaving my piano and then it was a bench
and then,

43
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,803
I dunno.
Do you know how people first found you 

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,140
online?
Well,

45
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:09,500
yeah.

46
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,060
Um,
yeah,

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,680
I can tell you the first,
uh,

48
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:13,514
the first person,
the first person who did it was a guy 

49
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,760
named Jack Doris Guitar Player,
uh,

50
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,390
his,
he had a vine called,

51
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,270
um,
back back pain or pain back or something

52
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:24,290
like that.
But yeah,

53
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,120
he was,
he was a big fan and he just sort of,

54
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,350
he just sorta,
you know,

55
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,213
gave me a thing,
know the thing that's amazing that he 

56
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:34,310
just found you in the nether.
Well he found me on twitter,

57
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:35,144
so,
uh,

58
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,493
yeah.
Um,

59
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,770
yeah,
no,

60
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,010
but that was good.
That was good.

61
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,780
Uh,
and then,

62
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,780
and then more people did it and it was 
all from that first 200 likes,

63
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,770
kind of like a steady climb.
Yeah,

64
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,330
I was Kinda like,
yeah,

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,113
I'd like to think that it was inevitable
because your style is so unique and 

66
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,000
everything about like your editing and 
your,

67
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,530
you have such a refined,
specific style,

68
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:02,500
so unique to you.

69
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,980
I think it was inevitable destiny.
It's very much that's very kind of,

70
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:12,000
you know,
metal that.

71
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,240
I mean that's,
that was the strategy.

72
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,010
I was doing it for a long,
long time,

73
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,120
just like,
I don't care.

74
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,190
How long were you doing it before 
anybody noticed?

75
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,640
Well,
I started the five day schedule in early

76
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:23,710
2014,
which was basically where I just snapped

77
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:24,544
because before that it was like I wanted
to do a million things and thought I 

78
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:29,260
could do anything but didn't know how to
put it together.

79
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:32,560
But finally somewhere along the line I 
just snapped and I just said,

80
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:36,360
okay,
we're doing five days a week video every

81
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,091
day.
He said,

82
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,250
I'm just going to grind.
I don't know what.

83
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,250
I don't know how to figure out how to 
put all this stuff in my mind,

84
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,990
so I'm just going to force myself to 
work,

85
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:44,321
work,
work,

86
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:44,810
work,
work.

87
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,643
Yeah.
And unfortunately they have to be very 

88
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:49,930
short if you do one every single day.
So why did you decide to.

89
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,540
What did you think the vine was the 
right medium?

90
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,650
Well,
that wasn't until.

91
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,250
I didn't even know about vine yet.
I was doing it on the website,

92
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,860
actually just the website for the first 
month.

93
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:02,260
They'll works.com.
And then,

94
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,120
um,
someone told me,

95
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:04,781
a friend said,
oh,

96
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,460
you're making videos,
why don't you put them on Youtube?

97
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,470
And I say I,
I like,

98
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,333
I like it when it's,
when you get the file and you can just 

99
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:11,674
watch the file,
like I don't really like streaming 

100
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:13,834
actually because I like to be able to 
pause it and horse it around and really 

101
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:18,880
see what you're dealing with.
So.

102
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,550
So yeah,
I didn't really like youtube but,

103
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,660
but he was like,
well you know,

104
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,900
you got to be on youtube so okay.

105
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,853
So I did you to boot.
So which is a pretty cool but I don't 

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,240
know him well.
But you had your break on mine.

107
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,070
That was probably,
yeah,

108
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:36,904
it was where things started and you were
posting simultaneously to youtube and 

109
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:40,564
vine at the trick was I had already gone
down to two week on youtube and then I 

110
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:46,780
discovered vine and I was like,
that would be,

111
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,200
would be great because you can't go 
longer so no one can be mad at,

112
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,640
you know,
so.

113
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:52,474
And they loop.
So the best way to watch short videos 

114
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:56,740
anyways to see him over and over again.
But I figured so I put them there.

115
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:57,574
I started putting them all there in 
order and I had to do a little bit of 

116
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:05,710
editing to square them and in some cases
edit them down to six from,

117
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:07,340
in some cases,
20 seconds down to six.

118
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,680
And that was kinda fun.
But uh,

119
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,593
yeah,
I put it in there and I wasn't even 

120
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:13,360
going to touch them.
And then I was doing twitter too,

121
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:15,760
so I had decent following on twitter.
Someone,

122
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,520
someone found me,
like I said it was,

123
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:19,570
it was someone found me there and then.
And then.

124
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,320
Yeah.
And so do you think that that has.

125
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:27,910
So for this amount of time you're 
craning on vine doing a video five times

126
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,744
a week.
Do you feel like that was like a really 

127
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:33,070
important creative time in your life?
Yeah,

128
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,220
well unfortunately I was desperate to 
stop as soon as,

129
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,560
as soon as it got going on,
fine,

130
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,553
because I already had like at that point
I was doing two a week on youtube and 

131
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:46,240
then as soon as I discovered the vines 
started to do its thing,

132
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:46,901
I was like,
okay,

133
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:49,780
well I got all of these on hand because 
I wasn't done uploading them all.

134
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,600
So then I said okay,
I'm just going to.

135
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,060
Well hold on.
You had a back log?

136
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,610
Yes,
because I had,

137
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:55,444
because it was like a year after year 
and a half after I'd started them five 

138
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:01,440
days a week that I started on vine.
So you are grant the microwave?

139
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,280
Yeah.
So,

140
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,113
so you were grinding and grinding and 
private and you had this incredible 

141
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,450
backlog of content.
They wasn't private.

142
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,880
It was on youtube.
Okay.

143
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,730
And it was on the website,
but it hadn't reached a mass audience.

144
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,811
So you were like,
man,

145
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:15,644
I've got like a whole library of content
and you were getting followers before 

146
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:21,620
you even were forced to make new stuff 
on vine,

147
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,390
but you were editing it down.
Right?

148
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:24,111
So I was.
Yeah.

149
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:24,944
So I figured I have these on hand,
so I would edit them and release them 

150
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,034
one a day,
so it was easy enough because I was 

151
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:32,780
doing two new ones and seven days a week
I just figured since I have them I'll do

152
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:33,900
7:00
PM every single day.

153
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,020
So and then I was like,
okay,

154
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,063
according to my calculations in two 
months I'm going to run out of content 

155
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,240
and I'm going to have to make a 
decision.

156
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:42,074
I'm going to have to either put the vine
thing down to two a week or accelerate 

157
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,863
everything to seven a week,
which was even more than I was doing 

158
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,234
before.
And this was after I was so sick of 

159
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:51,854
doing short videos,
I could just cry and I was already 

160
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,820
thinking about doing much,
much bigger things.

161
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:57,110
I was thinking about history at that 
point,

162
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,660
but.
But now I'm stuck doing seven,

163
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,770
seven short videos a week.
And how important was it for you to have

164
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:06,260
a schedule to really stick to it?
Oh,

165
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:08,000
it's,
it's life or death really?

166
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,700
Because if,
because if you don't,

167
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,620
you'll drown because you can do.
It's infinite.

168
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:14,090
You could spend infinite time then 
something.

169
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,373
So wait,
you're saying the schedule helps you 

170
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,280
escape the work or focused on the work.
It helps you.

171
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,190
It helps the thing get done.
Yeah,

172
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,730
because uh,
because when we started we also for some

173
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:26,564
reason had this idea that we got to post
a video a week and we were so strict on 

174
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,580
that and I don't even know where he came
from.

175
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,530
We just had this,
you mean back in the day?

176
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,770
I think it was just a personal thing.
It was like a,

177
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,620
it's what kept me motivated and kept 
because like you said,

178
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,210
you can focus forever on something.
You at a certain point got to cut for so

179
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:51,170
many reasons why I love the speed and 
the schedule.

180
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,910
So many reasons.
It's life or death.

181
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,463
Well that's not true because some of 
them were done without a schedule and 

182
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,150
they need it to be.
But when I'm off schedule,

183
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,163
I get obsessed with schedules and I 
start watching behind the scenes a 

184
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,590
seinfeld documentaries behind the scenes
and all of that.

185
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,560
Have you seen the south park one six 
days to air?

186
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,550
I had a while ago.
That's just incredible.

187
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,470
I even get addicted to like how stressed
out they get.

188
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:17,140
I'm just like,
no,

189
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,170
not that.
That's good.

190
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,420
You romanticize that little I.
Well,

191
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,171
yeah.
I mean I am.

192
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:22,004
Whenever I'm not on a schedule,
I get so obsessed with being on a 

193
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:27,080
schedule because it goes on forever.
You can't.

194
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,090
Especially.
I mean if you're a perfectionist,

195
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,220
I mean I'm kind of a raging 
perfectionist so you know there's there.

196
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,520
Yeah,
it'll go on forever.

197
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,913
What was that quite?
You've said you're a perfectionist and 

198
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:37,904
that sparked in me comment that Ila 
thought that she thought was wonderful 

199
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:41,174
and I was struck question because we 
have a question thread that we put on 

200
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:49,380
our separated people to submit questions
for you and there was a question there.

201
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:53,390
That was my favorite and it was how did 
you kill perfectionism?

202
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,380
Well,
yeah,

203
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,990
you can use a steam roller or a 
bulldozer.

204
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,393
It becomes incredibly important to do 
that when you have it as badly as I do 

205
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,743
from.
You're never going to get anywhere 

206
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,370
unless you have a serious strategy for 
steam rolling right over professional.

207
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,233
So you start to do,
there's one called a Monday good fire 

208
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:12,900
truck,
which is like,

209
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:15,210
that's probably,
I think I hit the mark the best in terms

210
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:16,920
of flattening perfectionism,
just like,

211
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,593
just just mash it.
That satisfies you when you smash your 

212
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:26,040
perfection is if it means you can get 
something done instead of if not.

213
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,023
Yeah.
Yeah.

214
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,910
And after you create a work,
do you look back and see like,

215
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,440
oh,
I could have done this different or that

216
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:33,840
different or that's in the past and it's
time to move forward?

217
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,820
No,
no.

218
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,270
Done.
And you're happy?

219
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:36,981
Yeah.
I don't,

220
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:39,840
I don't look interesting and so scary.

221
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,890
The schedule defeats the perfectionism 
when you hit your schedule,

222
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,060
that's it.
Well,

223
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:46,400
it doesn't impede the perfectionism,
but it,

224
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:47,080
it,
it,

225
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,400
it's like a tool to rags you along.
Yeah.

226
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,000
You know,
you get beat up and cut,

227
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,070
but you get there and you get stronger.
Oh my God.

228
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:57,510
The thing,
speaking of which the vine,

229
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,230
when I ran out of vines had to do them 
fast and then I was doing,

230
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,123
um,
started doing a history of Japan and so 

231
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:05,064
I flipped my schedule around and I 
started doing a history first in the 

232
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,420
earlier in the day and then just wait 
until the last two hours to do,

233
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:13,560
to do the,
to do the vine.

234
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,030
It was crazy.
I had some crazy times and I was,

235
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,953
you know,
I learned so many new tricks and 

236
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,440
techniques that I never would have 
learned if I didn't have to,

237
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,730
you know,
crunch down.

238
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,623
Yeah.
Is that because you're most productive 

239
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,874
in the morning?
I like your strongest worth because you 

240
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:31,860
said you did the history in the morning 
and know the reason for that.

241
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:34,930
I was trying to get ahead of the 
schedule with the,

242
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:36,390
with the vines.
Um,

243
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,700
but that never works because the 
deadline is not there.

244
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,563
So I would spend six hours doing one 
even though I thought I was going as 

245
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,020
fast as I can,
but I wasn't.

246
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:43,651
So I just said,
okay,

247
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:44,484
look,
I need to get this history thing 

248
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,390
happening.
Prioritize that as much as you can first

249
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:49,830
and then about 4:00
or something.

250
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:51,380
Just run for it and see what you can get
on.

251
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:52,214
Fine.
You know how many hours a day do you 

252
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:55,970
work?
It sounds you are incredibly productive.

253
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:56,804
You are incredibly focused on your work.
I can tell by the volume and just in 

254
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:01,614
your website and your work has so much 
detail and I mean how much do you do 

255
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:09,870
work and as much as possible how many 
hours as possible,

256
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:11,250
but the problem is I know what you're 
going to say.

257
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,420
You're going to say you got to take 
breaks and stuff.

258
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,530
I was going to say that.
Well,

259
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:15,990
most people say that we have as much as 
possible,

260
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,153
but the problem is when the problem is 
that when you work too much and then it 

261
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,074
starts fucking all of a sudden you can't
get out of bed in the morning or if you 

262
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:28,200
have relationships or other things you 
want to do that you are,

263
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,100
but if you like what you do and that's 
what gets you out of the bed,

264
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:33,930
then work as much as you got them all.
Please.

265
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,103
Yeah,
well I think I naturally tend to take a 

266
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,990
break even though I want to admit it 
sometimes,

267
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,420
even if it's time crunched,
crazy time crunch.

268
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:43,254
Sometimes I'll just go face down into 
bed just for 20 minutes just because I 

269
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,040
can't even just face down but.
But I can't.

270
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,750
But yeah,
I mean I know it's like,

271
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:52,531
yeah,
good to take breaks,

272
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:54,860
but how long should the breakbeat and 
how often should the brakes?

273
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:55,860
B,
you never.

274
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,070
Well,
what are you doing?

275
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,710
He'd say,
well I don't admit it.

276
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,990
I never admitted.
That's the problem.

277
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:02,824
I had that problem.
My problem is that I'll spend all day 

278
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:09,640
working are all spend all day being 
busy,

279
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,020
but then when I look back over the day I
never took a break necessarily.

280
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:16,000
Like where I'm like to step separate 
from my work,

281
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,400
but somehow I was less productive than I
thought I wasn't working the whole day.

282
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,400
I don't know when I took breaks,
I don't know.

283
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,160
I don't know.
I don't have a strategy for that really.

284
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,023
But.
Oh,

285
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,863
but when the.
When things take way too long as it is 

286
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,700
and,
and you know,

287
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,990
you,
there's no time to lose,

288
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:35,780
you know?

289
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,330
So yeah.
I got to make sure.

290
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,370
Do you have hobbies outside of a film 
and music?

291
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,190
Luckily I've been able to sort of 
incorporate most of them.

292
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,710
I'm trying to incorporate all of them 
into,

293
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,180
you know,
like anagrams.

294
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:52,120
I mean I used to just integrate that 
shit is banana.

295
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,600
I have to say I can't believe you.
So bill,

296
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:58,540
for context on his website,
Bill Wirtz.com.

297
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,300
Is that slash anagrams a no.
A yes.

298
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,610
No,
that's right.

299
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,850
That's right.
Um,

300
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,043
people submit sentences for you to 
Anagram and you'll unscramble it and 

301
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,070
make a new phrase.
Is that eh?

302
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:18,160
And some of them are really incredible.
Maybe you can pull some examples up down

303
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:19,210
that we can read it off.
Real well.

304
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,063
Got.
Some of them are really inappropriate 

305
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,630
for,
oh well,

306
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,910
family shout out,
saw the family watching,

307
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:27,850
but they'll have to endure for some 
reason.

308
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:29,960
It's,
it's very tempting to make them.

309
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,263
Dan sent me something here.
Let's say thank you for your recent 

310
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:35,194
purchase was the submission and bill 
turned it into try our corn cake 

311
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:42,700
funhouse therapy.
And then another one,

312
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:45,400
the joy of painting.
Fight to enjoy pain.

313
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,223
Now,
what?

314
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,870
That is incredible.
That in your mind you can anagram.

315
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,400
No it's not.
It's not in my mind.

316
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:52,540
You know,
you can use computers now.

317
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,760
Oh,
so you use like a website though,

318
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,643
a computer.
I know people are going to say I'll use 

319
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,850
computers.
A computer won't give you that.

320
00:13:57,851 --> 00:13:59,970
Look it along,
like go get a really long uh,

321
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,230
help me out here.
But.

322
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:01,671
So what?
Well,

323
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:03,810
what's your technique then?
How do you go?

324
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,691
Jeez,
I don't know if I.

325
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:05,471
can you.
Oh,

326
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,990
this is the match would never tell you.
No,

327
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,190
but you just gotta to.
Okay,

328
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:10,024
let's see.
Let's see.

329
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,973
Well if you have these in their need to 
find out where the V is going to go 

330
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,850
because otherwise it'll turn up leftover
if you have,

331
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:17,920
you know,
you've got to take care of,

332
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,200
you got to take care of that and then 
you just try some stuff.

333
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,100
And then also,
you know,

334
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,380
it's good.
It's good if it relates to the thing,

335
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:25,780
especially if it's a longer thing,
so if you know,

336
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,793
try to try to think of what words you're
gonna need to relate and just take care 

337
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,374
of that.
The long ones are fun because you can 

338
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:31,654
start out saying anything you want 
because the letters are going to be 

339
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,600
there and then you get down to the idea 
like,

340
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:36,050
oh no,
I have like a surprise,

341
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:39,830
huge surplus of ends and start over and 
try to work some more ins and outs.

342
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:40,664
And what is it about anagrams that 
fascinates you that that's a hobby of 

343
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,680
yours?
Yeah.

344
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:46,810
I started,
I went to my friend's house at one point

345
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,673
long time ago when he was rearranging 
scrabble tiles of just doing people's 

346
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,330
names and I was just for some reason,
so I just went home and started doing it

347
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,340
and I've been doing it ever since.

348
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,130
Well,
I tend to do like the things that are in

349
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,560
my life,
like if I would get a job I would do the

350
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:02,880
name of the job or did you know?
And uh,

351
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:04,250
yeah,
I've just been something I've done for a

352
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,140
long time and finally I was able to 
integrate it into the,

353
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,480
into the science.
I definitely noticed in your videos,

354
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:11,590
in your lyrics are very much kind of 
script,

355
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,010
you know,
mixing up words and a lot of wordplay.

356
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,080
Yeah.
Do you,

357
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:20,060
when you plan your videos,
do you plan out like how meticulously do

358
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:23,780
plan out and how much is it?
I know you've like remix jazz and you're

359
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:28,781
kind of a fan of or,
or you have where you remixed gas,

360
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,170
right?
Oh I,

361
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,940
there's a lot of like Coltrane and 
stuff.

362
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,430
Yeah,
it's just like jam jam sessions.

363
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,490
It's like,
it's like when it's like the way,

364
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:38,600
I mean jazz in that sense.

365
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,433
It's like when a bunch of guys get 
together and read standards like out of 

366
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:46,340
the real book.
So what happens to be,

367
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,203
except it's just me.
So what I mean is how much of it is 

368
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,723
improvised because it's,
it seems somewhat random but very 

369
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:53,870
controlled.
So when you're making a video,

370
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,760
do you make up anything as you go or do 
mit or is it completely planned out?

371
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:02,930
And then you execute the visual would be
kind of as I go along,

372
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,190
but in terms of what,
in terms of the audience,

373
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:07,024
in terms of the words melodies,
the exact chords and the timing of all 

374
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:11,843
the,
anything that's spoken or sung and the 

375
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,440
exact chords in the exact timing is all 
written.

376
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,623
If that's written,
everything else is just usually implied 

377
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,193
from there.
And then I just fill in the space and 

378
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,840
the underscoring.
Sorry,

379
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,450
sorry to the underscoring music.

380
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,900
So the extra little instrumental stuff 
that goes in between when I'm speaking,

381
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,860
that's all done after of that.
Makes sense to,

382
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,600
to sort of support.
And so you,

383
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,630
you do the music first,
it sounds like the built around,

384
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,480
not that music,
but the,

385
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,360
the,
anything that's sung or spoken?

386
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,150
I do that first.
The underscoring music is done after.

387
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,570
Interesting.
We've had a long one here.

388
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,170
Back to the anagrams here.
Where does this start?

389
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,410
Okay.
Super Sonic game.

390
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,630
Mega percussion.
Where does it start?

391
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:58,770
Cringe Poland's USS as long.
It's not long.

392
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,910
That's a short one for horizontal value 
that.

393
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,140
That one I had.
Oh,

394
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:03,831
I see what you're saying.
Yeah,

395
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:04,161
yeah,
yeah,

396
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:05,090
yeah.
Come on,

397
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,200
step it up.
Here's a law.

398
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,560
If anyone's wondering if anyone's just 
wondering the answer to that point along

399
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,750
his group is gruesome panics,
use more spacing.

400
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,060
It's escapism.
You're gone.

401
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,040
So you have choices.

402
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,540
Some of them I do.
So here we go.

403
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,374
Here's a long one.
I hope doing these anagrams provide you 

404
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:25,724
with an intellectual challenge.
That's the submission and here's bill's 

405
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:31,460
answer.
Guide me now as I get lunch,

406
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,510
pray to religions and escape the hot 
lava and hell,

407
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,603
that's it.
That's incredible that you untangle 

408
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:39,800
that.
Yeah.

409
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,870
I think once you start,
once you start doing them,

410
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,170
you'll,
you'll see a pattern.

411
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,060
Well,
no it's not,

412
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,090
it's just you just start to find stuff.
If you have a high standard,

413
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:48,850
you know,
you just have to just look and you know,

414
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,060
once you start to get ones that are like
that good,

415
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,220
then you start to like really get 
excited.

416
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,300
Is there anything interesting in the 
fact that like this,

417
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,163
there's a whole sentence with the 
alternative meaning in that original 

418
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:02,184
one,
is there something that fascinates you 

419
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:03,834
about just which one?
Like you're writing a whole new thought 

420
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,400
just from the original one.
Yeah.

421
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,540
I wonder if that's a thread somehow 
throughout your work.

422
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,703
I Dunno.

423
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's Anagram that I can't do it right 
now.

424
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,370
I'm so history of Japan when that came 
out.

425
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,310
That was an incredible,
incredible explosion.

426
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,810
Yeah,
so popular.

427
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,673
Yeah.
I mean right now I think it has 43 

428
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,380
million views,
but.

429
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,453
But that's now.
I mean I think it had something like 

430
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:40,260
just in the first week at like over 10 
million views or something or even more.

431
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:41,370
Maybe it was,
yeah,

432
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,230
probably about 10 maybe after a couple 
of weeks.

433
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,720
So surely.
You were just blown away by it.

434
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,550
Yeah,
because I was so tired of being stuck on

435
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,070
a vine stuck under seven seconds.
Like I said,

436
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:54,330
I was desperate to.
I was like,

437
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:57,840
if only I could do this,
I'm so in a way was a react because this

438
00:18:57,841 --> 00:19:02,040
was a really epic undertaking and this 
was a reaction to being like,

439
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,020
I hate doing the small stuff.
I want to do a huge.

440
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,580
I didn't hate it.
I loved it.

441
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,710
And when I would sit down to write a 
bunch of new ones,

442
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,570
I got really excited every time button 
I've,

443
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:12,300
yeah,
I really wanted to do something the same

444
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,143
thing.
So tell me how long did it take you to 

445
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:16,650
create that video?
Fourteen weeks.

446
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,740
Wow.
That's incredible.

447
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,680
Because on Youtube people do not.
People spend one day,

448
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,200
but it paid off in 14 weeks.
My God.

449
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,173
Tell me,
how did you do you don't want to know 

450
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:34,870
how long history of the world took.
I do want to um,

451
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,860
um,
how did you decide on Japan?

452
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,560
Are you a fan of Japanese culture in any
way?

453
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,420
But I,
I'm not an expert really.

454
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,550
I mean I was during for temporarily,
but I did.

455
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,730
I wrote one for the United States much 
earlier because I wanted to do that.

456
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:54,200
So you'll have this grip for us.

457
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,590
Never,
never got finished.

458
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:59,160
But um,
and it was going really well,

459
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:00,150
but it kind of,
you know,

460
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,030
I'd never done this before so I didn't 
really know it was kind of falling apart

461
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:05,400
because it kind of,
I knew too much about certain things.

462
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:07,560
And so yeah,
that didn't happen.

463
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:10,290
But then,
so when I came around to try it again,

464
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,573
I said I got to pick something that I 
don't really know about interests so 

465
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:16,344
that I can just learn about it from 
beginning to end and then just spit it 

466
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,800
out so it won't be,
you know,

467
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,490
just as a challenge because if I can do 
that then I can do anything.

468
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,370
So that was the idea.
There's almost a nice quality too,

469
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:29,700
I think in the end,
the output when you don't know anything,

470
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:30,361
like you said,
you know,

471
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:33,200
suit so much about USA.
It kind of muddles I,

472
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,034
yeah,
I know too much about some aspects of 

473
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:35,660
not enough.

474
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,160
Yeah.
And um,

475
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,093
what is your research procedure like 
because you know so much about so many 

476
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:43,950
things,
like all these little details,

477
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,220
it seems so well researched and you've 
got timelines,

478
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,690
characters.
How do you,

479
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,220
how do you lay that out?
I don't entirely remember actually.

480
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,760
I mean I did it very fast.
It took a long time to make the video,

481
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:01,450
but I was scrambling.
So how much time on research alone,

482
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,523
I can tell you that research and writing
was kind of together because I would 

483
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,030
just learn a bunch of stuff and then 
write just.

484
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,920
Right.
I think that was about a week.

485
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,040
I have the timeline.
I posted the timeline somewhere.

486
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,720
So yeah,
something like that.

487
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,990
Writing and research was about a week.
And are you re your.

488
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,390
I was always.
I'm wondering,

489
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:22,150
do you find people like nitpicking your 
facts?

490
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,370
Of course.
Does that bother you or you're just like

491
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,263
and whatever?

492
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,850
Uh,
yeah.

493
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,900
No.
Yes and no.

494
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,920
I don't know.
Yes,

495
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:30,970
I did the best I could,
you know?

496
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:31,360
Yeah,
yeah,

497
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,290
of course.
Yeah.

498
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,400
And it is entertaining actually.
I'm surprised at how few people do that.

499
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:40,540
Okay.
So that's your views and so many people.

500
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,374
I mean I was really careful.
I mean I'm obsessed with like 

501
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,500
geographical,
um,

502
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,543
accuracy.
Like I saw Japan video that I was 

503
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:51,010
watching like to learn stuff and they 
had Kyoto really in the wrong place.

504
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,340
It was a cartoon drawing and I was like,
I know I'm just,

505
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,030
I'm kind of obsessed with with that 
while it showed,

506
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,953
it's when I watched that you're like,
this is a guy that knows what he's 

507
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,550
talking about.
It kind of has that vibe.

508
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,533
So.
But when you present yourself in that 

509
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,660
way,
there's always people who are looking to

510
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,490
like find one thing to nitpick,
you know,

511
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:12,610
I probably spend too long on those 
things where I put the stars on the,

512
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:13,960
on the,
on the cities,

513
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,490
you know,
I remember,

514
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,440
I remember actually there was an early.

515
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,970
I haven't seen that since it came out by
the way,

516
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:22,660
but I think there's an early point where
I'm showing where all the old,

517
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,810
like clans are or the old.
So you haven't watched the video?

518
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,080
I've not seen it since it came out.
Why flashbacks?

519
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,530
Flashbacks?
Of what?

520
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:33,580
Just the just.
Yeah.

521
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,920
I don't know.
I don't watch videos after I make.

522
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,180
I try no exception unless someone like 
forces me to,

523
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,090
if I see it by accident,
but what I was going to say is,

524
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,213
yeah,
I probably spend too long on those ones 

525
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,810
with the stars.
Now when you say that you're like,

526
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,350
you're kind of like that one was a 
millimeter like that one was.

527
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,513
That one was difficult because it's like
ancient clans and stuff like that are 

528
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:57,280
ancient ancient locations.
Like one of them is called Hai Hai.

529
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,180
How do you google that?
Yeah,

530
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,250
took a long time and there was one for 
history of the world where I showed like

531
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,084
a million cities and I spent a long time
getting the exact coordinates all for 

532
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:11,350
like half a second on screen,
so I don't know what's wrong with me,

533
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,100
but.
Well,

534
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,030
you know,
whatever.

535
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,680
And I think something's great.
Yeah,

536
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,730
thank you.
Got It all backward.

537
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,140
I find it interesting that you don't 
watch that video back.

538
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:24,700
I,
I love it so much.

539
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,920
That video is amazing.
It's amazing.

540
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,100
It's got to feel good help.
Almost prolific.

541
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:33,040
That video was how it kind of 
reverberated through culture.

542
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,590
It wasn't just youtube,
it was on reddit.

543
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,030
It was online,
it was everywhere.

544
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:40,110
It was on television.
I mean everybody does.

545
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:43,120
You see it on regular television.
I must have.

546
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,350
I must have.
I don't know,

547
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,481
maybe it was.
I don't know.

548
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:48,640
I don't think it was.
I think people,

549
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,780
the way I remember it was people were 
watching it.

550
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:53,540
I remember Black Joe Rogan was watching 
it and talking about it.

551
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,860
It just was so prolific and it's 
influence.

552
00:23:57,861 --> 00:23:58,694
I mean,
that's the mark of this insane quality 

553
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:04,220
that you brought to it that nobody 
really.

554
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,960
None of your contemporaries are really 
doing.

555
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,600
And I see you smiling.
There was too kind,

556
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,560
too kind.

557
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,540
Well,
I think it's amazing.

558
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,160
I think you're incredible.
I think you're a gift.

559
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,610
Oh Geez.
Um,

560
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,730
I love that part by the way.
Um,

561
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,930
when the nuke.
Oh,

562
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,760
Dan just founded on CNN.
Bill,

563
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,480
what's up now?
CNN doesn't count.

564
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,700
Is it on CNN?
We have a clip on there.

565
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,630
One of their youtube channel.
Check it out later.

566
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,030
Oh,
he doesn't want to launch.

567
00:24:34,031 --> 00:24:39,031
CNN must've covered it at some point.
I don't know where it's on television,

568
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:42,860
baby.
I love this moment.

569
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,723
My favorite moment with the Hiroshima.
He does this for those of you who 

570
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,843
haven't seen it,
I mean mostly I'm sure all of you have 

571
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,023
history of Japan.
When the US drops the bomb on Japan and 

572
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,750
the video is very manic,
super fast paced.

573
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,320
It's very dense and then all the sudden 
the bottom drops and it's just like.

574
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,303
Yeah,
and another one and it just gets quiet 

575
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:12,140
for a long time because of the manic 
nature of the video.

576
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,973
It makes that moment so powerful.
It's been a long time getting that 

577
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:17,654
sound.
I'm layering windy sound and the huge 

578
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:24,530
bass sound.
Just really feel that explosion.

579
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,393
A lot of layers in that.
It's like a drum and then it's pitch 

580
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,610
pitch way down now.
Was there you.

581
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,040
You nailed that so beautifully.
Did you read,

582
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,253
was there something in your research 
like that informed that when you were 

583
00:25:39,661 --> 00:25:41,390
just,
you felt the gravity of that?

584
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:44,000
I know that I don't,
obviously it's heavy,

585
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:48,330
but like I feel like there was a real 
expression there,

586
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:50,390
a real empathy there.
From what I heard,

587
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:53,390
they dropped a bomb and destroy it a 
couple of like entire cities,

588
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,760
so that's,
that's a big deal.

589
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,350
That's a big.
Yeah.

590
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,720
Yeah.
That is a big deal.

591
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,420
Well,
I love that.

592
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,243
And then you.
You touched on it again in history of 

593
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:07,160
the world in a really beautiful way to.

594
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,690
What was it?
They did a game.

595
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,190
The game show thing.
It's fun because I got to hit the same.

596
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:15,470
It's kind of like back to the future to 
hit some of the same things,

597
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:16,730
but do it a little bit differently.
Yeah.

598
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,613
Actually the most fun part was doing.
We'd like the video game soundtrack 

599
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,890
music for,
for that,

600
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,050
for that section.
You play video games.

601
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,510
There's no time anymore.
No time became a play.

602
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,760
Now is the one game where I make videos 
so I.

603
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,610
that's fun.
Yeah.

604
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,183
I guess if more people thought about 
life as a video game that might be more 

605
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:37,514
productive.

606
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:46,030
That's a shower thought while we're on 
our first break.

607
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,113
When we come back I have,
I want to talk about so much more 

608
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,063
incredible.
Bill Wirtz the incredible talent to 

609
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,910
apologize.
I'm terrible at doing interviews.

610
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:56,830
I'm sorry.
Now I really.

611
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,580
I so,
I mean this is.

612
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,920
I don't get out first interview.
Oh God,

613
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,390
yeah.
Of this sort?

614
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

615
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,003
Well first,
let me say that trusting us with that 

616
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,400
experience of you coming here,
it means a lot to me.

617
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,593
I appreciate that and I think you're 
doing great and I'm fascinated by 

618
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:19,050
everything you're saying.
So let's go to a quick break.

619
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:21,780
We will be back after this with Bill 
Wirtz.

620
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,940
They'll go away.

621
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,220
Here's a product that I wish I had when 
I was a kid.

622
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
Candid.
Okay.

623
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:35,220
They make these incredible invisible 
braces that you order out.

624
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,350
They measure your teeth,
they send it to you at home.

625
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,150
They go on,
they look clear.

626
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,480
You can't even tell you're wearing 
braces and it fixes your fricking teeth.

627
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,170
I was walking around with metal in my 
mouth and then have ruined your life.

628
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,140
This is so much better.
This is the future candidate.

629
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,840
Have you ever had a problem with your 
teeth that you've always wanted to fix?

630
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,853
I've got an option that can help you.
You won't need to go through the hassle 

631
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:59,280
or longterm treatment of wire braces,
Aka life ruining torture,

632
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,590
and you can do it all from the comfort 
of your own home.

633
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,660
It's a new company called candidate by 
the way,

634
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:06,390
you can pop them out and in to like when
you're eating,

635
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,060
I mean this is so much better.

636
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,313
Candida makes clear aligners that are 
sent directly to your home and are 

637
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:17,010
customized specifically for you to 
straighten your teeth.

638
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:18,090
By the way,
this is what they look like.

639
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:18,924
Ben,
I don't know if you show on the screen 

640
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,200
the aligners fit crooked teeth,
crowding,

641
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:26,034
protrusion and gaps.
The first step is to purchase their 

642
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,124
modeling kit,
which will be sent to your home so you 

643
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:33,390
can take impressions of your teeth.
And,

644
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,423
uh,
after you send back your impressions 

645
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:39,510
with some photos of your teeth,
candids networks of orthodontists review

646
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:40,344
your specific case and provide you with 
the three d preview of what your 

647
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:44,724
treatment will look like.
We're having a real orthodontist is the 

648
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:48,624
main reason you're going to love 
candidate because other companies use 

649
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,540
dental professionals.
Whatever the heck that means,

650
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,790
am I right?
They wrote that.

651
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,990
I don't know.
After you received your red preview,

652
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,070
it's completely up to you.

653
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,820
If you want to move forward with your 
clear aligning treatment plan or not,

654
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,210
and you can always talk to a real person
at any time if you have any questions.

655
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:12,150
They have great customer support.
White Glove,

656
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:15,300
they said whatever that means.
White gloves,

657
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,640
their customer support.
Whereas white gloves,

658
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:20,490
you guys if that's good for you or not.
I don't know.

659
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,430
I prefer without gloves personally and 
here's the best part.

660
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,293
Candidates,
treatment time is an average of six 

661
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,470
months.
I think I had mine for like two years.

662
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,363
I had mine for six months.
Oh well you know you're ruining the 

663
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:35,610
coffee six months and will literally 
save you thousands compared to the other

664
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:36,444
guy I did have mine for like two years.
So you're one step away from getting 

665
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:41,190
straight in whiter teeth.
I did.

666
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,760
They white,
I guess they and them too.

667
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:43,594
I don't know that.

674
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,220
three.
Listen Up.

00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,050
You Bald headed goofs.
All right,

676
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:09,880
this one's for you.
If your hair's falling out,

677
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:10,714
if you're in the shower,
you see that cycle your air going down 

678
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,420
the drain.
Listen,

679
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,210
66 percent of men lose their hair by age
35.

680
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,163
The thing is,
when you start noticing your hair's 

681
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,810
going,
it's already too late.

682
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,793
It's a way easier to keep the hair,
that beautiful hair that you've got on 

683
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:26,770
your head than it is to replace the hair
that you've already lost.

684
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:27,604
Okay?
I know that hairline is slowly moving 

685
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:31,300
backwards like the,
like the,

686

uh,

687
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:35,224
comes back in.

688
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,233
You got bald spots.
How do you feel a year from now when

690
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,840

00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,570

When you think of the perfect gift,
you probably don't think of an electric 

716
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,380
toothbrush,
but guess what?

717
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:07,381
You should because quip is one of the 
most gift guided gifts of the season and

718
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:08,980
this is why.

Here are some of the things that you can
discover just a couple from analyzing 

762
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:33,590
your DNA.
Do you like the taste of Cilantro?

763
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,690
I've heard people say that it tastes 
soapy,

764
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,440
which I found was blew me away because I
love Cilantro and Mexican food.

765
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,740
Apparently that's genetic.
You can find out if you have an aversion

766
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:44,600
to Cilantro.
How about this?

767
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:49,601
Your ability to match musical pitches,
genetical you can see and their DNA.

768
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,320
How about this one?
Uh,

769
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,560
my cell phone?
Yeah.

770
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,833
They say that right?
Everyone hates noises like nails on a 

771
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:56,810
chalkboard.
But for some people,

772
00:34:56,811 --> 00:35:01,811
the reaction can incite rage or panic.
That's something mosquito bites.

773
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:04,100
How frequently do you get bit by 
mosquitoes?

774
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:09,250
This always and so much more.
You can find out from this report report

775
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:11,360
just from spitting out a little tube and
send it off in the mail.

That's a number two or three a and d 

778
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:22,820
meet.com/
[inaudible].

779
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,100
Again,
23andme.com/h

780
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:25,963
three.
Welcome back everybody here with Bill 

781
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,453
Wirtz.
I want to ask you about history of the 

782
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:30,614
world I guess.
But before that I am curious to ask you 

783
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:33,344
about.
You have this very unique aesthetic 

784
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,890
style and to me as a video editor 
myself,

785
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,960
I am captivated by your editing style.
It's incredible.

786
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,850
Um,
how did,

787
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,620
where did you,
how did you develop that style?

788
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,551
I don't know,
I,

789
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:48,930
I,
I'm just trying to get,

790
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,300
you know,
be reasonable really.

791
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:54,210
I mean I'm just trying to do it,
do what needs to be done,

792
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:55,110
you know,
get the job done.

793
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,650
And unfortunately it's the only way I 
can do it really.

794
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:00,480
And some people say everything looks too
much the same,

795
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:03,720
which I don't know how I'm gonna avoid 
that because you know what,

796
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,100
how is that the only way you can get it 
done?

797
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,933
Because it seems like there's a lot of 
effort that goes into the visual 

798
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:08,694
quality.
Like you've got this kind of neon 

799
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:16,431
psychedelic and it's like multilayer.
Well you know the are huge,

800
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,323
right?
You do all the art and the videos are a 

801
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:20,820
lot of most developments.
Clip art.

802
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,451
Right,
right,

803
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:22,290
right.
Which is kind of.

804
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,620
Well I got a graphics thing when doing 
history of the world because I wrote all

805
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:28,380
this stuff about space and stars and 
then you're gonna have earth.

806
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:30,480
Like what are you going to do?
So I got kind of graphics tablet,

807
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,100
so that's cool.
Yeah,

808
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:33,120
that's helpful.
Too Bad.

809
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:33,954
I can't really,
you know,

810
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,940
a long way to go there.
But.

811
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,930
No,
no,

812
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,070
it's great.
I mean it's great.

813
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,660
It's very specific style.
But do what,

814
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,660
what do you edit and can I ask that just
as a,

815
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,730
I'm,
I'm a curious editor myself.

816
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,830
Well,
I'll give you a hint,

817
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,240
it's,
I'm screwed and a lot of a lot of people

818
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:54,744
are in or we're,
I don't know if anyone's stayed screwed 

819
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:58,350
for this long.
If you were to.

820
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,783
Yeah,
there was a popular program that was 

821
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,180
industry standard.
I know long time at a certain.

822
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,070
Yeah,
at a certain point they made another one

823
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,000
with the same name,
but it's,

824
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,220
oops,
it's a different program.

825
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,540
So.
And I'm sure it's fine.

826
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,120
Most people hated it.
X Ten,

827
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,190
whatever.
Most people hated it when it came out.

828
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,243
Then they bad mouth my trusted is going 
to be okay because the other option is 

829
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,240
the one that you have to pay every month
and it's like,

830
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,990
I can't do that.
I don't want to do so.

831
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,340
Um,
so yeah,

832
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:28,110
I trust that it's gonna be okay,
I'm going to switch,

833
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:30,960
but there's never a good time to relearn
everything.

834
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,793
I know every week I learned a new thing 
on the thing that I'm using and I've 

835
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:34,921
had.
I mean,

836
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:37,380
if you want to know what it looked like,
go back to the first Monday video on the

837
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,214
five day schedule.
I think it was about a Pelican or 

838
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:42,750
something and it's nothing.
It's like text and nothing.

839
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,250
Well,
the truth is,

840
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,640
I mean you are using what was considered
industry standard.

841
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:51,270
It's not even that.
It is the light light version of that.

842
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,710
Oh,
it's missing.

843
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:53,970
I don't know what,
but I've never seen it.

844
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:56,740
So I don't know what I mean.
You got eight stuff.

845
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,660
Oh yeah.
The truth is,

846
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:01,494
uh,
I'm looking forward to switching but 

847
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,800
because like we added put me here and 
um,

848
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,260
I feel like with every upgrade they've 
actually added some stuff that are.

849
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:14,920
So sometimes they'll just break the 
software and that was a true.

850
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,170
Are saving so much time.
Let's say a new mask.

851
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,790
And do you know anything about final cut
10?

852
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,090
Yeah,
I know I used final cut but not 10.

853
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,950
So that's the new one you have to pay 
for?

854
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,620
Or is that the one that uses x?
X is the one that x is what replaced.

855
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,483
So which is what you're talking about.
I've literally only met one person ever 

856
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:37,090
that liked X.
everybody else.

857
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,170
But we'll see.
I've heard,

858
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,063
I've heard the same rumors,
but I have found at least two or three 

859
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:43,030
people that say,
yes,

860
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,440
it's fine,
don't worry.

861
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:46,150
It's getting better.
It's getting better.

862
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:46,984
They say they're adding back all the 
things and it's like the one I have is 

863
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:53,800
not even the one that you think I have.
It's worth so you can do.

864
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,490
You can do it on anything as long as you
spend time with it and that's one of the

865
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:59,590
reasons I don't like to go around saying
what program it is going to know.

866
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,423
People are just eager to buy a thing and
they think they're going to get a 

867
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,650
billboard that's a,
that's an emulator.

868
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,863
They won't get that.
That and that's true of kind of any art 

869
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:07,834
craft.
If you have like a sick guitar or an 

870
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:14,080
amazing computer or whatever is the tool
that you use,

871
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:17,800
you have to master your craft and here's
another thing that helps.

872
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,800
If you get really crazy software before 
you know how to use it,

873
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,860
will it will ruin you and it.
I mean I've been,

874
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,140
I've been there,
I've done that and.

875
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,993
And you get frozen for for years,
you just don't even touch the thing 

876
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:32,470
because you don't know what to do.
So intimidating and not intuitive.

877
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,690
Those,
these programs are not intuitive at all.

878
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,681
Well,
they might be,

879
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:37,390
but it takes time to learn.
It's like a language,

880
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:37,960
you know?
Yeah.

881
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,793
Interesting.
Yeah,

882
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,873
I think that's good.
That's good advice for people who are 

883
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:42,094
trying to learn things is just get in 
there and do that first and then worry 

884
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:47,340
about the tools and just got to you.
I just,

885
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,200
you gotta use simpler tools.
I mean you got to just use what you have

886
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,300
used,
what's available and you know,

887
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,570
you'll go really far and then by the 
time you're ready to,

888
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,970
you know,
then one by one step by step you can get

889
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,183
an upgrade.

890
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:05,230
But the.
So did you develop this visual aesthetic

891
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:07,510
with the title fonts that you use and 
all that?

892
00:40:07,511 --> 00:40:11,440
Is that something that you just started 
with or is that something you developed?

893
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,660
I'm just trying to get by.
Yeah.

894
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,290
Yeah,
it does develop over time if you want to

895
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,760
see what it was.
I mean,

896
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,050
you know,
go back to Monday,

897
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,810
Pelicans or whatever the heck that was,
nothing.

898
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,330
And then gradually just a little bit 
more.

899
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:25,450
And then when I started doing vines 
everyday really fast,

900
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,070
it kind of accelerated.
I mean,

901
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:28,370
I just started learning all kinds of 
stuff.

902
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,340
That's cool.
Um,

903
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,103
so let me ask you still learning stuff.
I mean now I'm on a really tight 

904
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:36,460
schedule and I'm learning more and more 
and more.

905
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,980
All good.
I'm learning so much about editing.

906
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,910
I was,
I did what you said not to do and it was

907
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:46,210
to my detriment because I learned how to
edit on premier,

908
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,313
which is like the industry standard on 
pcs and you when you don't know what 

909
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:53,320
you're doing and you don't know the 
right tools,

910
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,513
it's,
you're so freaking slow and it's taken 

911
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:58,510
so long to catch up.

912
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:02,530
Like I was working with an editor we had
hired just a couple of months ago.

913
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,480
Alex,
sweet kid,

914
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,343
great kid.
I don't want to call him a kid that's 

915
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:06,970
like,
he's a sweetheart.

916
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,820
He's a great kid.
Um,

917
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:16,020
and he taught me like a couple of little
key shortcuts that like changed my life.

918
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,460
Like it's literally saves me hands up 
ours.

919
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,070
Yeah.
I have this crazy thing.

920
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:25,630
I mean there's a lot of.
And the thing I use,

921
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:26,464
there's a lot of things that don't,
don't have shortcuts that drives me 

922
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:28,810
crazy.
But there's a trick,

923
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:33,230
I use a on a Mac,
if you could command question mark opens

924
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:34,064
up the help menu and then you can type 
the first two or three letters of what 

925
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:37,754
you need.
So it's like eight strokes but I do it 

926
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:40,940
anyway.
Oh,

927
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:43,220
you got to shortcut the shortcut.
Yeah,

928
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,250
I mean I have all this.

929
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,860
Like I said,
that's why I'm going to be so screwed if

930
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:46,694
I have to switch because it's like I 
keep finding new little tricks and 

931
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,910
inventing new tricks.
Or do you,

932
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:51,803
when you edit,
are you on the laptop or a computer or 

933
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,280
laptop and to use a mouse?
No.

934
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,100
Oh my God.
I had a feeling,

935
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,330
you know,
I had one of those nights,

936
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,660
I had one of those nice trackpads on the
side,

937
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,380
but the um,
the batteries like leaked and it got the

938
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:15,620
door that the battery door got stuck 
that a usual,

939
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,513
I could not get it open and it was,
it was like leaking acid and then I 

940
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:23,870
couldn't get the thing I have,
I cannot edit on a laptop,

941
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,090
you know,
I met a man without a mouse.

942
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,983
I mean the thought of that is 
unbelievable and it's a testament to 

943
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:32,220
your genius and dedication.
But I will say if I were a genius,

944
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,950
I'd probably get something better.

945
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,030
But again,
the problem is we're all screwed because

946
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:41,960
if you go to system higher than whatever
the one high Sierra was the one where it

947
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:44,570
officially stopped working.
So what?

948
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,870
The,
the program doesn't work anymore and the

949
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,940
new computers.
So you're limited.

950
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,520
But I'm going to.
Well,

951
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:53,540
I'll say this,
you run.

952
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,523
I knew a kid.
You may not know anything I'm talking 

953
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:58,820
about,
but it reminds me of this for all of you

954
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:03,050
who have ever played world of warcraft 
or serious video game.

955
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,600
Do you play video games?
We'll work craft.

956
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:05,434
Do you know about any of this stuff?
I don't have time to do anything except 

957
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:08,564
make.
Unfortunately it was a very intense 

958
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:11,354
video game that's played with a mouse 
and a keyboard and I have a friend who 

959
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,343
clocked thousands of hours,
was in the highest level of rating of 

960
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,970
collaborating with 40 plus people,
high level raids and I played with him a

961
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:26,450
lot.

962
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,283
I was good friends with him and one day 
I went to his house and I saw this kid 

963
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,273
on a laptop without a mouse and I didn't
know it was possible to do that and I 

964
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:37,214
was absolutely blown away.
He was playing a high level game with a 

965
00:43:41,691 --> 00:43:42,524
trackpad on a keyboard.
It blew me away and I thought this man 

966
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:49,400
is a.
he's incredible and I have this.

967
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:53,690
I have this admiration for you.
To edit without a mouse is truly a feat.

968
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,850
It's probably not smart.
It's probably not smart,

969
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,133
but the desk that anyone who supports me
on Patrion is going to get so mad 

970
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:01,190
because I,
you know,

971
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,023
because I'm not spending money on.
I have a desk that is 10 years old and 

972
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:08,960
cost $10,
probably 10 bucks.

973
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,340
Where'd you get it?
That was it.

974
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:13,400
Convenience store pharmacies and those 
pharmacies.

975
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,660
Now that you,
that you and you bring up an interesting

976
00:44:17,661 --> 00:44:20,210
point,
you are supported primarily through your

977
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:21,620
Patrion,
is that correct?

978
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:22,331
No,
it's,

979
00:44:22,331 --> 00:44:23,990
it's a combination of,
of,

980
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,830
of things.
Yeah.

981
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,370
But that's a,
that's a big piece of the puzzle.

982
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:29,360
So patrion,
by the way,

983
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:30,194
if you guys want to support bill,
put it in the scripture and 

984
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,660
Patrion.com/bill
wirtz,

985
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:34,710
right?
Yeah.

986
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:36,323
And I have to apologize for my lack of,
of a social skills in tact and 

987
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:42,690
everything,
but thank you to anyone who has.

988
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,501
I've never,
you know,

989
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:46,620
my patron is blank is blank and I've 
never said,

990
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:48,870
you know,
it's like really promoted.

991
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,950
No,
no,

992
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,770
but they are helping pay my rent 
essentially.

993
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:55,950
So thank you for that.
Well I think that's fair.

994
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:57,990
When we were starting off,
we had a patron,

995
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:59,283
um,
and we also had it blank because I 

996
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:03,030
don't,
I think that's the point,

997
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:03,864
right?
Because they want you focusing on what 

998
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:09,760
you do and not necessarily trying to 
make gifts and not central for people.

999
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,480
I'm not sure that's how I saw it.
I was just like,

1000
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:15,000
thank you for supporting me.
We can continue to do what we do,

1001
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:16,410
which is apparently what you want more 
of.

1002
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,690
Right.
So I think that's perfectly fine.

1003
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,260
I hope so and,
and,

1004
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:23,760
and very reasonable because I didn't 
have one and everyone said know,

1005
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,653
Geez,
why don't you just at least make one 

1006
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:26,184
just so you know.
So,

1007
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,163
you know,
so yeah.

1008
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,720
But is it true that you turn off ads on 
your youtube video?

1009
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:31,554
Not entirely.
I had them off for a long time and then 

1010
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:35,220
I realized that if you want to get the 
red,

1011
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,773
uh,
income from that you have to go the way 

1012
00:45:39,061 --> 00:45:40,050
they have it.
Wow.

1013
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:42,960
Uncheck every box except for display 
ads,

1014
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:44,490
which is the one that puts a picture on 
the side.

1015
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:47,410
I still didn't want to do that for a 
long time because,

1016
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,230
uh,
because when I see ads,

1017
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,133
like really when I see them,
it really makes me uncomfortable and 

1018
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:53,490
stuff.

1019
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,750
So really?
Yeah.

1020
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,280
So,
so,

1021
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:59,010
but I have that on there and I know,
you know,

1022
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,053
you're going to be mad at me for not a 
lot of people are mad at me for not 

1023
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:05,230
having the video pre roll video ads on 
like the history video,

1024
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,250
but I don't.
I figure so.

1025
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,420
So you never really had a big payoff 
from those big,

1026
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:16,590
big Japan and history of the world did 
because through the other things,

1027
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,930
the youtube red stuff.
No,

1028
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,720
through patron and there's paypal donate
thing.

1029
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,060
Oh.
So a lot of people responded at directly

1030
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:24,894
support.
Yeah.

1031
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,430
Oh well God blessed.
That's,

1032
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,640
I'm really happy to hear that.
I think so yeah.

1033
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,550
Thanks to those people who are there.
Um,

1034
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,430
I support you on Patrion you just did 
this morning.

1035
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,440
I good enough at it.
You don't promote it as well.

1036
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:42,900
I figured you were just making money 
like the rest of us.

1037
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,330
But here you are like working your ass 
off and amazing content.

1038
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,600
The thing is certain,
I won't even mention the name,

1039
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:52,434
but certain web companies and stuff like
I'm stalking me for the rest of my life 

1040
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:02,650
through through targeted ads like 
interests and you know,

1041
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:03,563
and it's like I can't even,
I can't put other peoples through that 

1042
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:09,540
bother you that people follow you on the
Internet trying to sell you shit.

1043
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,660
You have to becoming targeted ads and 
it's just really annoying.

1044
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:14,100
It's good strategy.
Even though,

1045
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,300
and this might help you be at ease with 
putting ads on your videos,

1046
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:23,100
you have an option as a youtube creator 
to turn off targeted ad.

1047
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:24,210
That's true.
That's true.

1048
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:25,163
I don't know if that helps you.
It might because I do want you to 

1049
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:30,820
prosper and to make money so I don't 
know,

1050
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,160
but that is that the primary reason you,
you don't run ads on your videos,

1051
00:47:35,161 --> 00:47:39,040
it's just a drag for the pure and plenty
of people always tell me,

1052
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:39,580
no,
it's not.

1053
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,270
People are saying,
you know,

1054
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:40,780
no,
it's not.

1055
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,160
You know,
they say we don't mind,

1056
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,650
but they can't speak for everyone,
some people.

1057
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,023
But do you do.
What do you think about the fact that 

1058
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:50,620
like everybody on the,
um,

1059
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,220
how do you say the expected experience 
is that there's an ad there,

1060
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,083
you know,
like television or any popular medium 

1061
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:57,334
because how,
how are you expected to provide for 

1062
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,713
yourself?
That's a good point because maybe the 

1063
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:03,370
reason I haven't done it,
I'm trying to psychoanalyze this because

1064
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:05,140
I really,
I probably should,

1065
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:06,770
you should,
I,

1066
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,970
I think you should.
And so I know what it is.

1067
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,090
I remember when there were no ads on 
youtube.

1068
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,920
I don't know if you remember that,
but youtube is like,

1069
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,540
there's no way they can't put ads on 
youtube.

1070
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:17,374
It's the Internet ads are for the TV.
And then I remember the first day I saw 

1071
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:23,470
an ad on youtube and I felt like the 
outrage,

1072
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:24,623
you know,
so I guess it's been a long time since 

1073
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:27,604
then,
but I still,

1074
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,530
I guess youth that outrage lives.

1075
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,560
Yeah.
Even though maybe I shouldn't anymore,

1076
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,070
but look,
but look at you,

1077
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,420
you are extremely hardworking,
talented,

1078
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:38,410
your life,
your work.

1079
00:48:38,411 --> 00:48:39,244
As you say,
I don't have time to do anything else 

1080
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:40,894
because I'm working.
So this is not just some dude posting 

1081
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:46,630
vlogs are fucking around a hobby.
I mean this is your life,

1082
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:47,464
this is your work.
I mean you're entitled to get paid for 

1083
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:51,124
that work.
And,

1084
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,320
and in addition to Patrion,
which is completely optional,

1085
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:54,480
if people can support you there.
Oh.

1086
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,323
So it was an artist.
You say like your work is your art and 

1087
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:03,610
you put it up there for free and you 
know,

1088
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:07,870
like other artists sell their work so 
you put it out for free.

1089
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:09,940
So at least you could get money that 
way.

1090
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:11,930
Yeah.
Okay.

1091
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:12,763
I'll turn it on.

1092
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:19,310
Not to impress you.
I say that for most things too,

1093
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:19,830
but it,
it,

1094
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:22,580
it doesn't work that well nowadays 
because with the Internet you still have

1095
00:49:22,581 --> 00:49:24,680
to one person and then they can send it 
to everybody else.

1096
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,330
Oh,
you smelled like digital media.

1097
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:27,203
Well it's still music,
but I mean it's also on the streaming 

1098
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:30,170
sites.
So there's paid for that I guess.

1099
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,543
I guess there's ads there,
so technically there are ads so you 

1100
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:34,790
know.
But in the Internet,

1101
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:35,241
you know,
it's like,

1102
00:49:35,241 --> 00:49:36,560
it's kind of,
you know,

1103
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,110
selling stuff on the Internet is kind of
not entirely real good.

1104
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:42,680
I mean you can sell it to the first 
person.

1105
00:49:42,681 --> 00:49:44,960
You could charge a billion dollars for 
the first one,

1106
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,930
but then once one person has it,
they could,

1107
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,960
they could just send it to anyone.
Well,

1108
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:54,830
what do you think about what Wu Tang did
had that album that I was thinking that.

1109
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,873
I mean that's,
that's.

1110
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,110
Yeah,
they did it.

1111
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,173
And as far as I know,
nobody's heard that album at Martin 

1112
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:00,770
Shkreli.
Still.

1113
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,530
That's too bad.
It is too bad to prison.

1114
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:06,470
He can't do anything with it now.
It's probably an evidence been somewhere

1115
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,780
in prison.
It list for them.

1116
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,510
I had heard that he had played a portion
of it on a stream.

1117
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:15,200
Really.
You know,

1118
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,050
I cannot believe that album was sold for
only a million dollars.

1119
00:50:18,051 --> 00:50:20,990
It's Wu Tang.
Like how did nobody pay more than that?

1120
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:25,850
Martin Scarelli is the only guy who 
willing to shell out a milli for that.

1121
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,173
Yeah.
You would think like someone like Jay z 

1122
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:30,074
or you know,
someone who's like really Wu Tang 

1123
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:35,743
anyway,
I still haven't figured out what it 

1124
00:50:37,011 --> 00:50:37,844
means,
what it means to sell stuff on the 

1125
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:40,980
Internet and what.
No,

1126
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,110
because in the old.
Yeah,

1127
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,033
I just looked it up and uh,
apparently that album is now in the 

1128
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:45,944
hands of the government and they seized 
his uncle because I wonder if they ever 

1129
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:53,054
imagined their million dollar album 
would end up in the hands of the 

1130
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:56,480
government of all people.

1131
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,190
Maybe they'll add it to the library of 
Congress.

1132
00:50:58,550 --> 00:50:59,383
Hey,
there you go.

1133
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:01,490
They should.
Sonia.

1134
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:03,470
That's so funny.
So do you,

1135
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,670
what do you consider that?
What,

1136
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:09,470
how do you consider that act by Wu Tang 
to have this one CD?

1137
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:13,250
Is that cool?
Or is theoretically what I thought was a

1138
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:14,084
legit thing,
but I still have not really figured out 

1139
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:19,120
what I think about that.
Because you want people to hear you.

1140
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,600
Do you want your work to be seen by as 
many people as possible?

1141
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:24,920
Exactly.
So that's why you want to.

1142
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,780
Yeah,
it's interesting and strength.

1143
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,260
Definitely.
Interesting.

1144
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,250
But anyway,
not to persuade you about the ad thing,

1145
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:39,550
I only am looking out for your best 
interest and I want you to prosper and I

1146
00:51:39,651 --> 00:51:44,090
think you'd be surprised by how much 
that can then add to your,

1147
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,820
your,
your quality of life for Christ sake.

1148
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:47,740
Yeah,
I might.

1149
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,890
I might do it.
I mean,

1150
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:49,724
do you,
do you have any idea how much money 

1151
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,793
those two videos alone with it?
It'd be a lot of people have deemed me 

1152
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:57,670
on twitter.
I mean hundreds of thousands.

1153
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:59,090
Well No.
People have.

1154
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,120
I used to get dms on twitter saying 
we'll pay you.

1155
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,233
I won't tell you how much money,
but we'll pay you this much money for 

1156
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:11,201
you to just turn over the rights to the 
ads for those big viral hog.

1157
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:15,440
So funny.
Like viral people that wanted to buy the

1158
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:15,841
ads,
right?

1159
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:16,461
I don't know.
Someone.

1160
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:17,670
Someone said we'll give you,
you know,

1161
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:21,390
made a huge hugs and assuming no driver 
for,

1162
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,130
for just that ad sales.
And have you had like sponsors reach out

1163
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,350
to you as well?
Yeah.

1164
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,100
Any interesting people come in rolling 
through your email.

1165
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:32,790
Interesting opportunities.
Yeah.

1166
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:35,540
Anything interesting that you're working
on?

1167
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:36,543
Things usually the most interesting ones
have these long disclaimers at the end 

1168
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:41,510
that says you can't talk about any of 
this.

1169
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:43,380
So.
Okay.

1170
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,620
No,
I'm not asking.

1171
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,483
You don't have to talk about it,
but that's cool to know that you're 

1172
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:49,940
cool.
Yeah.

1173
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,860
That's awesome.
Yeah,

1174
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,173
that's exciting.
I can't wait to find out whatever that 

1175
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:56,810
is.
Well I've,

1176
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:01,670
I've said no to a lot of most of them or
save them or.

1177
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,730
I mean I'm notoriously bad at 
collaboration,

1178
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,830
collaboration kind.
So.

1179
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:08,503
Well that's good.
At least I was hoping that people would 

1180
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:17,570
have recognized kind of what,
what's going on with you and because I.

1181
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,021
well,
what,

1182
00:53:18,021 --> 00:53:19,130
what is your,
um,

1183
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:24,820
what is your aspirations?
Are you feel like you've arrived youtube

1184
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,640
or what is your dream?
I'm going to take take over the world.

1185
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:32,460
Maybe take over the world.
You want to be the dictator?

1186
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:32,700
No,
no,

1187
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:32,851
no,
no,

1188
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:32,990
no,
no,

1189
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:33,180
no,
no,

1190
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:33,870
no,
no,

1191
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:34,040
no.

1192
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,940
I don't wanna do that.
I don't know.

1193
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,830
You want to make a movie?
You want to make a cartoon?

1194
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:40,980
You want to make an animated Alva 
hopefully something better.

1195
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:42,350
You know,
thing,

1196
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,470
figure out what that is,
you know?

1197
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:44,650
Interesting.
Yeah,

1198
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,073
I would.
I would freaking die to have like a 

1199
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:52,680
history of like that as a show would be 
absolutely captivating.

1200
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,680
I want to do that to the problem and 
that's what I wanted to do.

1201
00:53:55,681 --> 00:53:57,890
But the problem is it takes so long to 
make you will,

1202
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,720
you would work with people.
Is that something?

1203
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,460
I know,
I know that would be how to do it.

1204
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,383
You could have a team of 20 people.
You can make one every month or I know 

1205
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:11,700
you can make a whole 10 marks and 
they're already doing it.

1206
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,550
We already got a show.
It's just slow.

1207
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,280
We don't get an episode every week 
about.

1208
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,010
Is that okay or would you be happy to 
see it accelerate?

1209
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:20,640
Is What?
Okay.

1210
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,410
Oh the right now never was.
That's why I.

1211
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:26,280
Yeah.
Well it's been a wrong way.

1212
00:54:26,281 --> 00:54:27,270
Ron,
if you could,

1213
00:54:27,271 --> 00:54:28,104
what?
What's like the perfect rate of 

1214
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:31,710
releasing those in your ideal world 
history videos?

1215
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,450
Yeah.
Once a week.

1216
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,220
Is that enough time to do all the 
research?

1217
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,980
Here's the problem.
Then I did the entire world just because

1218
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:45,420
I figured let's escalate,
how do we see Japan and after doing that

1219
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,920
I don't,
I look,

1220
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,840
I'm really interested in history or I 
was.

1221
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:50,910
I mean I'm really like really,
you know,

1222
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:52,283
and after doing that,
like I don't want to say another word 

1223
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:56,800
about history African.
Oh really?

1224
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:57,813
Yeah.
So you don't want to make the history 

1225
00:55:00,121 --> 00:55:00,954
series.
I did.

1226
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:03,720
It was the only thing I wanted to do for
a long time and then I did.

1227
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,800
I just did the entire world.
Not that I accept everything in that.

1228
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,520
In fact that was the most painful part 
was because the more you learn,

1229
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:13,740
the more you find out how much you're 
going to have to leave out.

1230
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:15,910
It's like 99 percent you have to worry 
about and you know.

1231
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,030
Yeah.
That was painful.

1232
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,650
But I assume so.
Are you not working on a,

1233
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,890
another history video right now?
No,

1234
00:55:21,891 --> 00:55:22,724
not right now.
No.

1235
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,753
I'm doing songs like every.
Is there some longterm project and the 

1236
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:28,350
background that you're working on?
No,

1237
00:55:28,351 --> 00:55:30,180
but I think there's about to be.
Oh yeah,

1238
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,490
because I just got to the.
Yeah,

1239
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,333
I think there's about to be,
you found a topic or something that 

1240
00:55:34,171 --> 00:55:35,970
fascinates you or you don't?
Um,

1241
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,051
yeah,
I can't.

1242
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:37,884
Yeah.
Okay,

1243
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,460
cool.
Yeah.

1244
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,540
Well I know that every,
everybody loves,

1245
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,660
everything you put out is adored,
but those,

1246
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,720
those specific works or just like,
I mean they're modern masterpieces and I

1247
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:54,430
think everybody just can't get enough of
that anymore.

1248
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,770
Just a masterpiece.
You cannot get people on Youtube.

1249
00:55:58,771 --> 00:56:00,180
To what,
how long has the history of the world?

1250
00:56:00,181 --> 00:56:01,014
It's like for like 19.
I was hoping it would be five because I 

1251
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:08,850
didn't have time to take another three 
months off,

1252
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:10,590
you know,
so I was like,

1253
00:56:10,591 --> 00:56:11,470
okay,
five years,

1254
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,120
five to seven.

1255
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,953
And then I was writing,
I was writing it after two months I was 

1256
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:17,100
still writing,
not making the video.

1257
00:56:17,101 --> 00:56:17,934
I was researching writing after three 
months and it's at 12 minutes and it's 

1258
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,680
like reading at 14.
Yeah,

1259
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,100
it's just,
you gotta turn the adds on to.

1260
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,190
So how long did it take you?
Total will be 11 months.

1261
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,630
Wow.
Yeah,

1262
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,640
we're at,
I don't recall.

1263
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:35,680
Were you gone during that whole time?
Just like,

1264
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,630
what do you mean?
Were you posting videos?

1265
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,550
No,
I was like,

1266
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:39,423
it wasn't done.
But I mean on your youtube channel you 

1267
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:42,520
hadn't posted?
No,

1268
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:44,050
there was nothing.
Oh Wow.

1269
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:44,800
Yeah,
it was rough.

1270
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,800
Every single day you wake up to like 
everyone's saying pressure and like gone

1271
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:51,960
from the.
Yeah.

1272
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,850
But you came back big time.
Well,

1273
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,900
I never left when you posted.
Well,

1274
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:00,610
I mean in the end,
the mental collective of the world,

1275
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,210
so to speak.
Yeah.

1276
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:05,933
So let's move on to the history of the 
world then because that video now if I 

1277
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,680
see that video,
uh,

1278
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:12,514
the history of the world I guess has 55 
million views and sits on our videos 

1279
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:20,110
number two of all time with 176,000
up votes.

1280
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:22,150
Do you use reddit?
No,

1281
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:24,280
not really.
But do you understand?

1282
00:57:24,281 --> 00:57:24,691
Kind of.
Yeah,

1283
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,140
I know what I mean.
How nuts that is.

1284
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:27,863
So when you posted that video,
what was your expectation for the 

1285
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:32,380
reception?
Well it was,

1286
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:33,873
I knew Japan did that.
It was number one and read it and all 

1287
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:37,420
that stuff.
So I was like,

1288
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:38,710
okay,
this could end.

1289
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,830
It's a huge escalation from the Japan 
video.

1290
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,500
It's like the ultimate thing,
so I was like,

1291
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:47,080
okay,
this could really get there,

1292
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:49,070
but you just can never get it.
You can never.

1293
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:49,983
Which is scary.
I've been working on this for a year 

1294
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,880
since I was thinking at the end of it I 
was like,

1295
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:56,830
I never want to spend this long on a 
thing again.

1296
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:57,663
It's scary.
I'm very thankful that it came through 

1297
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:00,250
and it,
it,

1298
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,270
it did,
it did as well.

1299
00:58:01,271 --> 00:58:02,950
So what was that like for you when you 
finally.

1300
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,440
That must have been such a relief or 
relief.

1301
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,333
Somebody told me,
somebody texted me and they said it's 

1302
00:58:07,781 --> 00:58:09,690
number one year.
It's number one thing.

1303
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,130
I was just really.
Because I spend that long,

1304
00:58:12,131 --> 00:58:12,830
you know,
you don't want.

1305
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,950
And Are you happy with how it came out?
That video?

1306
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,200
Yeah,
I guess.

1307
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,750
I mean I'm,
I haven't watched it since it came out,

1308
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:20,584
so I think it's okay.
There's plenty of things that are just 

1309
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,380
way under cooked.
I mean look,

1310
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,330
it went through like within the first 
four months and something that I started

1311
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:29,830
working on the graphics and stuff like 
that.

1312
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,740
I was,
I mean I must have spent all day looking

1313
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:36,280
for images of different like apes and 
stuff like that.

1314
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,700
I must have spent all day looking at 
apes and finding that perfect clip art.

1315
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:40,810
Yeah.
And then I was like,

1316
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:42,363
what am I doing?
It occurred to me that this is going to 

1317
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:48,241
take multiple years to finish if I don't
seriously kick myself faster every day.

1318
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,000
So it really just became again and again
and again.

1319
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:53,650
I had to just pick myself up and just go
faster.

1320
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:56,440
That kind of goes back to the whole 
issue of deadlines because you're such a

1321
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,303
perfectionist.
When you remove that deadline it can 

1322
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:00,300
probably drive you crazy.
Yeah,

1323
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,250
I mean,
but you know,

1324
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:05,680
I mean around October I set a deadline 
of December.

1325
00:59:05,681 --> 00:59:07,780
First I was like,
this has got to get somebody.

1326
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:11,470
During October,
November I was kicking ass.

1327
00:59:11,471 --> 00:59:12,380
I was like,
dude,

1328
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,423
working so fast,
but it came around to December and I 

1329
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:17,860
wasn't nearly done and then I just 
couldn't get out of bed for a few days.

1330
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,850
It was just too much,
by the way.

1331
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:19,684
It didn't get done to me.
What you said you couldn't get out of 

1332
00:59:21,651 --> 00:59:23,440
bed.
You mean you were just despair.

1333
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:25,140
Just like working so hard.
I was just like,

1334
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,680
I needed a break because you're,
you're.

1335
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:32,000
Are you up to the point of like you're 
not even sleeping that much there?

1336
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:34,270
I do sleep.
I sleep good sleep.

1337
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:37,620
How much sleep you sleep?
I sleep 10 hours a,

1338
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:38,720
it'll be like nine or 10.
Yeah.

1339
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,993
God bless you.
Unless now I'm on a schedule and 

1340
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:42,254
unfortunately toward the end of the 
schedule it gets ridiculous toward the 

1341
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:46,580
deadline.
It gets you set an alarm clock.

1342
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:50,000
No,
God bless you to do.

1343
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:50,834
I know.
I don't know if for me be the one joy 

1344
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,780
being self employed is not setting an 
alarm clock.

1345
00:59:56,781 --> 00:59:59,320
I mean that's,
that's all that matters for me.

1346
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:02,540
Problem is I tend to drift telling you 
personal things,

1347
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:05,870
but uh,
by sleep schedule drifts forward like an

1348
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:07,520
average,
about an hour a day.

1349
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:12,290
Like on average you would like rotating.
So you sometimes wake up at like 3:00

1350
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:12,801
AM.
Well,

1351
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:13,700
anytime it'll,
it'll,

1352
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,140
it'll keep drifting.
If I don't have to,

1353
01:00:15,141 --> 01:00:16,820
if I don't have to work for anybody 
else,

1354
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:17,810
you know,
it'll,

1355
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,673
it'll gradually drift.
So what's your sleep schedule that like 

1356
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:21,134
right now?

1357
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,650
Right now I woke up early.
You're on the early one,

1358
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,750
but I mean I just released the.
Well yeah,

1359
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,290
it's,
it's,

1360
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,230
it's,
it's weird.

1361
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:31,770
It's.
I got it.

1362
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:35,850
I got enough sleep though and um,
I find that so interesting.

1363
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:36,883
So

1364
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,433
do you find yourself more productive at 
a certain time of day or is it all just 

1365
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:43,550
rotating?
It's all a blur.

1366
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,413
It doesn't matter that much.
What time it is kind of food do you 

1367
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:46,580
like?
Oh,

1368
01:00:46,581 --> 01:00:47,510
I don't know.
You order.

1369
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:48,830
I would cleared.
Food is weird.

1370
01:00:48,831 --> 01:00:50,990
I don't like to talk about food.
You don't like talking about food.

1371
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,060
Food is weird,
man.

1372
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,150
Not that interferes.
Food is weird.

1373
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:57,020
It is weird.
The whole thing go eating thing.

1374
01:00:57,021 --> 01:00:58,170
It's just a weird thing.
No,

1375
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,023
it's good.
And we all,

1376
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,300
I think we all think we all do it.
We,

1377
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,550
I mean certainly that is a requirement.
I have to.

1378
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,000
I think I read a book that says we all 
do.

1379
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,610
We all do it.
It is pretty weird though.

1380
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,770
I don't find it.
That's strange.

1381
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:11,990
I love food.
You can tell by looking at me.

1382
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,380
I'll eat all day and he was pregnant and
she's.

1383
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,240
We can,
we can not talk about food.

1384
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,790
I mean I don't have that much to say 
about it unfortunately.

1385
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:23,390
That's interesting though.
Isla doesn't really love food,

1386
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:27,330
but she's pregnant now and she's turned 
into like a,

1387
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:29,990
I want to say beast mode,
which I love.

1388
01:01:29,991 --> 01:01:30,824
I don't.
I mean that is an absolute compliment 

1389
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:36,350
because I'm a monster and she hardly 
eats so now for the past three nights in

1390
01:01:36,351 --> 01:01:41,150
a row,
we've had pizza at midnight last night I

1391
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:42,560
was eating pizza with the and I was 
like,

1392
01:01:42,561 --> 01:01:46,320
this is the happiest I've ever been.
It really did say that.

1393
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,020
I usually each their own.
Yeah.

1394
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,100
I usually don't care about pizza,
but you don't have a preference.

1395
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:55,920
You don't like specific foods.
Pizza.

1396
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:59,270
It's okay.
I didn't realize how some reason.

1397
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:03,980
I don't really like to talk about food.
I don't know why he lists that way.

1398
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:07,310
What about,
are you a coffee drinker?

1399
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,550
Ice,
ice cold?

1400
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:14,303
I just really don't like to.
I really don't like to talk about 

1401
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,820
preferences of like what,
okay,

1402
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,760
what different people leader or at least
for me sound like to talk about it.

1403
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,660
Okay.
So let me.

1404
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,790
But I will say that.
Um,

1405
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:29,371
yeah,
hot coffee.

1406
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:30,330
I just can't,
I can't,

1407
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,340
it,
it's,

1408
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,280
it's,
it,

1409
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:36,000
it burns me physically.
You're sensitive to the temperature.

1410
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,140
Yeah.
Interesting.

1411
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:37,990
Like,
I dunno,

1412
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,690
I just drink it and you're like,
oh no,

1413
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:42,790
I'm burnt.
Doesn't burn.

1414
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:47,800
Like for the few days as well.
My brother's very temperature sensitive.

1415
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:50,461
He kept.
Yeah,

1416
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:50,910
he,
he,

1417
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:53,880
he can't eat like until it's like 
lukewarm at a hottest.

1418
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,540
Has this explosion in popularity since 
these last two videos,

1419
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:59,040
do you get recognized on the street 
ever?

1420
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,021
Well,
I mean,

1421
01:03:00,021 --> 01:03:00,550
uh,
I mean,

1422
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,340
sorry of those,
those big too,

1423
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:04,480
I feel like really put true.
Yeah.

1424
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,990
Do you get recognized on the street 
ever?

1425
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:07,830
Does that happen to you?

1426
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:15,210
Maybe it does happen sometimes.
And do you um,

1427
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,620
has this popularity affected your life 
in any way or you feel like everything's

1428
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:21,780
the same?
It's weirdly the same.

1429
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,380
Right?
Because before I had it,

1430
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:29,600
I was pretending that I did.
It's just convenient because now I don't

1431
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:32,690
have to change a damn thing.
That's interesting.

1432
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:36,780
When I was posting five times a week on 
the website and I had it all like that,

1433
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:37,623
you know,
I didn't even tell anyone that I was 

1434
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,114
doing that and I was just carrying on,
like pretending that it was really 

1435
01:03:41,641 --> 01:03:42,474
important and they do have a day job.
What was life like before you were 

1436
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:46,770
making money from your art?

1437
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,380
Like music stuff,
you know?

1438
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:52,170
Oh,
music stuff like gigs and stuff.

1439
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:53,630
It's various things,
you know.

1440
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,860
Cool.
Yeah.

1441
01:03:55,140 --> 01:04:00,140
God bless 'em.
I'm just wondering,

1442
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,120
have you gone to you seem,
are you classically trained with music?

1443
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,830
I sort of know.
Uh,

1444
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,013
no,
but I figured out sort of through the 

1445
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:12,960
grapevine,
like the names of stuff,

1446
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:18,030
like the names of the notes in the chord
self-trained oh yeah.

1447
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,080
Completely.
Really?

1448
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,010
Yeah.
And what,

1449
01:04:20,011 --> 01:04:21,870
what was your first instrument?
The keyboard?

1450
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:26,640
It was piano and drums and piano.
Back to drums and piano.

1451
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:29,510
Interesting.
Who are your music inspirations?

1452
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,230
What kind of music do you like?
Oh God,

1453
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,064
I don't know.
But you have a very specific style and 

1454
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:37,850
you know,
and you know,

1455
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,260
that's,
that's unfortunate because,

1456
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,660
you know,
I,

1457
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,570
I wish I could,
I'm just trying to do,

1458
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,980
do whatever I can,
you know,

1459
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,143
you know,
it's like if you have a green tractor 

1460
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:54,480
and if that's the one you have people 
say,

1461
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:55,314
why do you like to drive?

1462
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:57,680
I want to have,
you know.

1463
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,140
Do you listen to music though?
Because yeah.

1464
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,220
Your whole life.
Is Music Your Music Ira?

1465
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,110
It is.
What are you listening to these days?

1466
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:06,150
Unfortunately there's not that much 
time.

1467
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,450
But you have a favorite artist?
No,

1468
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,460
I don't.
I don't break it down like the Beatles.

1469
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:12,923
Well I don't even like really break it 
down by artists because it's every 

1470
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:17,703
single artist is going to have stuff 
that I really love and that I don't 

1471
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,240
like.
And I think it's that way with everyone.

1472
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,450
Maybe it's not even by song,
by Song.

1473
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:28,900
There's parts of the song that I love,
parts of it that I don't even individual

1474
01:05:28,901 --> 01:05:30,250
moments of songs.
Wow.

1475
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,760
Parts of it that I don't think I can do 
and don't it.

1476
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:33,880
So he's funny.
That's funny.

1477
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:36,190
That reminds me of kind of what Jason 
Donkey said.

1478
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,920
He does this,
this blew me away.

1479
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,083
He says he'll take songs that he loves 
and cut out the parts he likes and cut 

1480
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:48,850
out the part that doesn't like and then 
make a cut of his perfect idea.

1481
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:52,500
In that Song I've done that really 
changed the billing to a.

1482
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,910
I cut up the bridge to pretty woman and 
changed it.

1483
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,520
Pretty Woman Roy orbison.
Great tune.

1484
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:58,354
For some reason the bridge just it takes
this detour that really bores the hell 

1485
01:06:01,301 --> 01:06:02,134
out of me.
So I just changed it without adding 

1486
01:06:04,571 --> 01:06:05,404
anything new.
I just took the meat part and I pitched 

1487
01:06:07,211 --> 01:06:09,340
it up a whole step and another whole 
step and comes back around.

1488
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,490
Were you always interested in music or 
was that kind of,

1489
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,200
you know,
keeps coming back.

1490
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,470
I think by the time I was about 10 and I
was just like,

1491
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,400
it was just one of those things that 
kept coming back.

1492
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:19,953
I was like,
oh,

1493
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:21,100
I better do this then.
Yeah.

1494
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:22,653
Is there,
is there an artist or band or style 

1495
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:27,610
where you think like that's like,
what was it?

1496
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,473
Was there something you ever heard as a 
child or whatever where it was kind of 

1497
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:31,984
transformed when you're like,
I want to make music because this is 

1498
01:06:34,931 --> 01:06:36,370
just so brilliant.
Yeah,

1499
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:38,860
it was probably a bunch of stuff.
I don't remember exactly.

1500
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,500
I don't know.
Can you hear those?

1501
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:45,370
There's,
there's sirens outside.

1502
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:46,713
The soundproofing can only do so much.
It was actually a window behind that 

1503
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:52,990
foam Paul Desmond sacks plan on,
on take five.

1504
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:54,460
It's a very famous tune.
I mean,

1505
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:57,310
he does a nice job on that.
That's real good.

1506
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:58,710
I mean,
I heard that at a young age.

1507
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,360
Feel good.
So that's jazz.

1508
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,913
I don't know.
Yeah,

1509
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,210
sure.
Dave Brubeck.

1510
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,650
There you go.
Um,

1511
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:07,863
people.
Uh,

1512
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:09,010
but yeah,
I know.

1513
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:10,640
I don't know.
That's a weird thing to talk about.

1514
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,550
Now people are gonna think.
Well,

1515
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,080
I don't know.
It's all good.

1516
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,140
You don't?
Nope.

1517
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,250
No pressure.
I don't know why I'm so weird.

1518
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:18,940
No,
you don't.

1519
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:22,120
I get the sense you don't like talking 
about your musical inspirations.

1520
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:27,330
Well that's not true,
but I'm a little confused about what you

1521
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:30,340
like or what about what you want to say.
Yeah.

1522
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,500
I'm not sure.
I haven't figured it out yet,

1523
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:38,590
but one thing that I will always come 
back to again and again is popular music

1524
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,500
can't get away from it.
Really can't ignore it.

1525
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:45,610
You loved pop music.
I refuse to hate it unconditionally,

1526
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:50,470
which I think it seems like everyone 
around is always doing it and I can't.

1527
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,150
I,
I will.

1528
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:52,984
I think.
I think that's a wise way because 

1529
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:58,600
clearly there's something there that 
people find irresistible.

1530
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,310
Sure.
At pop music,

1531
01:08:00,311 --> 01:08:00,940
you're right.
As,

1532
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:01,773
as always,
from the times of like what I was a kid 

1533
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:07,180
like backstreet boys and Brittany Spears
or whatever's popular.

1534
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,740
The reaction of everyone is always to be
like everyone was cool.

1535
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,593
Yeah.
But then you start finding these 

1536
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,920
articles and now on youtube,
you know,

1537
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:20,220
you can see interviews from 1955 from 
1925 from a,

1538
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,790
you know,
for any given year in the past.

1539
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:24,163
Everyone's always trying to say that 
nothing's good nowadays and that the 

1540
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:29,750
latest technology has ruined everything.
Right?

1541
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:30,703
Once you see how prevalent that 
viewpoint is at every single moment in 

1542
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:35,564
history,
suddenly you just can't take it 

1543
01:08:36,231 --> 01:08:37,720
seriously anymore.
You know?

1544
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:40,520
Why would it be true now if it wasn't 
true then that's really,

1545
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,500
that's a really great option.
So it's just I have,

1546
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,060
I have no patience anymore for,
for,

1547
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,930
for the pop,
the unconditional pop hate.

1548
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,650
Thanks.
That's a great great.

1549
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:52,280
And I'm not saying I like every tune 
that's ever on the radio,

1550
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,233
but man,
every given your and everyone has 

1551
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:57,530
different tastes but any given year if 
you just check out the charts,

1552
01:08:57,531 --> 01:09:02,531
there's at least a handful of tunes that
are just like here,

1553
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:04,611
you know,
I,

1554
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:05,444
I know and it'll be different ones for 
different people and maybe some people 

1555
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:08,300
like none of them.
That's fine.

1556
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:09,680
Maybe,
maybe that's true,

1557
01:09:09,681 --> 01:09:10,970
but I just think it,
it just never.

1558
01:09:10,971 --> 01:09:11,840
It never stops,
you know,

1559
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,900
2014,
2000,

1560
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:14,810
one,
19,

1561
01:09:14,811 --> 01:09:16,580
52.
I mean sometimes I go to,

1562
01:09:16,581 --> 01:09:19,850
there's a charts website where you can 
just listen to stuff and you'll hear,

1563
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:24,020
you'll hear good stuff and you'll hear 
people that are copying their neighbors,

1564
01:09:24,021 --> 01:09:26,450
just trying to sneak in there and that's
always there too.

1565
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,220
And that's cool.
I don't know.

1566
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:31,220
I think that's really wise and reminds 
me,

1567
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:35,240
the best example of that that I always 
hear is like Bob Dylan,

1568
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,060
when he switched to electric,
everybody was like,

1569
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:40,670
uh,
it's so poppy and it's not authentic,

1570
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:44,600
and everyone was saying that he was a 
hack and it was making pop music because

1571
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:46,010
he switched the electric guitar.

1572
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:47,870
Maybe you could say that about Bob 
Dylan.

1573
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:50,263
You can't say that about anyone is,
do have a artist today that you like a 

1574
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:57,350
pop artist that you're a fan of.
Can't really.

1575
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,630
I can't really,
you don't like naming.

1576
01:09:59,631 --> 01:10:00,740
I can't really say,
you know,

1577
01:10:00,741 --> 01:10:03,790
there's so many things were and I don't 
even pay attention anymore.

1578
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,633
Like,
because there's,

1579
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,620
there's certain songs where I'm like,
yeah,

1580
01:10:06,621 --> 01:10:07,590
I love that song.
And I was.

1581
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:08,823
But I don't even think about whether or 
not it happens to be by the same person 

1582
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:14,030
of another song that I can't stand.
I just don't even notice anymore.

1583
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:15,950
I don't even.
Interesting.

1584
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:17,210
I don't know.
Um,

1585
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:20,203
I would say when I look at your style,
I will consider to be almost 

1586
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:25,250
psychedelic.
Do A.

1587
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:28,400
is that an influence on you at all?
No,

1588
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:30,380
not,
not physically,

1589
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:32,090
not physically,
no.

1590
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,053
But you know what it was.

1591
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,620
What do you mean?
Do you take academic?

1592
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,361
No,
I've never.

1593
01:10:38,361 --> 01:10:39,194
I've never done.
Yeah,

1594
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:40,163
no,
I,

1595
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,040
we were talking about this backstage.
You kind of are,

1596
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:46,100
you have this frank Zappa kind of vibe.
I think about you with this,

1597
01:10:46,101 --> 01:10:49,280
like really excentric brilliant music 
and you,

1598
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,203
you may know about for example,
is that he was very much not a drug 

1599
01:10:53,961 --> 01:10:55,520
user.
He was very sober,

1600
01:10:55,521 --> 01:10:56,354
in fact,
to the point of even expelling people 

1601
01:10:58,191 --> 01:10:59,024
from his band for using drugs and that 
was during the sixties and seventies 

1602
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:04,690
when,
when everybody was on drugs and I,

1603
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:05,743
he was one of the most eccentric and 
creative musicians from that time 

1604
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:10,400
period.
Do you,

1605
01:11:10,401 --> 01:11:11,990
uh,
relate to that?

1606
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,530
But I wouldn't do.
I mean,

1607
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:14,383
I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't kick people off the bat 

1608
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,010
unless it was like messing up.
Yeah.

1609
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:20,551
You're like,
dude,

1610
01:11:20,551 --> 01:11:23,370
you're not good at or not shown up to 
the Gig.

1611
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:24,750
Yeah.
Do you play in bands?

1612
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:26,970
Do you play music with other people?
Right now?

1613
01:11:26,971 --> 01:11:28,080
I just.
Do,

1614
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,430
I just do solo?
Yeah.

1615
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,553
Because you're very much a one man band,
as I understand from watching your 

1616
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:35,150
videos.
Yeah,

1617
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,510
but the.
But the live,

1618
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:38,250
the live show is going to be a band for 
sure.

1619
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,630
Oh,
we got a live show,

1620
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,251
but the thing.
No,

1621
01:11:41,251 --> 01:11:43,070
but the thing is it's going to be.
It's going to be a.

1622
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,960
It was just going to be a band.
Tell me about this live show.

1623
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:46,890
What's.
What is this?

1624
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,930
It's not happening.
It's not happening yet.

1625
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:49,764
But you're planning.
Yeah.

1626
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,120
Well No,
I'm not for it yet,

1627
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:52,950
but I'm planning to plan.
You're planning the planet.

1628
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,793
Yeah.
It's in the word.

1629
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,650
And so I'm very curious about this.
I think a lot of people are.

1630
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,900
This is a tour that you want to do.

1631
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:03,060
Well,
like I said,

1632
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:04,520
I'm not planning it,
but I'm planning to planet.

1633
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:06,120
Okay.
So you haven't got that far.

1634
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,440
No.
And the problem is,

1635
01:12:07,441 --> 01:12:08,274
but while I'm doing it,
I can't make a new any new songs or 

1636
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:13,560
videos,
but it can be a lucrative.

1637
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:16,170
Does that to you?
It does money.

1638
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:18,990
Does money motivate you at all?
Well,

1639
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:20,243
it doesn't change.
I hope it doesn't change what I do or 

1640
01:12:24,211 --> 01:12:25,230
like how I do it.
So.

1641
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:26,041
No,
I mean,

1642
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:26,910
yeah,
I mean I need it.

1643
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,410
You need it.
I need some of it.

1644
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,333
Yeah,
right.

1645
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,173
Yeah.
Yeah.

1646
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:31,203
Are you,
you don't care about being a 

1647
01:12:31,771 --> 01:12:33,930
millionaire.
I think you just want to keep doing what

1648
01:12:33,931 --> 01:12:34,670
you do.
Well,

1649
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:35,940
that'd be convenient.
It'd be nice.

1650
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,340
Well,
touring will be very lucrative.

1651
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:40,703
I don't know if you want to do it like 
that and putting ads on would also be 

1652
01:12:43,021 --> 01:12:45,800
very liquid dude.
You would be making it.

1653
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,060
I'll do it.
I'm telling you,

1654
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,060
you're going to text me and be like,
thank you dude.

1655
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,520
I'll have to text the million people,
other,

1656
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:57,130
other people who told you to get started
first.

1657
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,013
I think the only one.
But can I take credit for having 

1658
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,380
convinced you?
Because this I feel like.

1659
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,510
No because you didn't convince me.
I'm not going to do it.

1660
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,770
I'm just saying that could get you off 
my back basically.

1661
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:08,604
Fair enough.

1662
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,000
Okay,
fair enough.

1663
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:13,560
That's cool.
It's a good.

1664
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:14,700
Honestly,
it's a smart idea.

1665
01:13:14,701 --> 01:13:17,340
I probably should do it.
Well.

1666
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,810
Um,
let me see here.

1667
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,530
Oh,
you won that.

1668
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:24,110
You won the shorty award?
Yeah.

1669
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,900
How was that experience for you?
Because you went up there and just drive

1670
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:30,540
her to thank you and you bounced out.
It was too weird.

1671
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:33,050
What was weird about it?
Well,

1672
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:36,360
it's kind of alarming how bad my social 
skills are.

1673
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:39,990
Like when I go to a place like,
it knocked me out.

1674
01:13:39,991 --> 01:13:41,390
Like I didn't even expect,
you know,

1675
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,473
I went to,
I got invited this vip find party thing 

1676
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:47,130
and it was like I walked in and I walked
right out.

1677
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,710
You just walked in and did a one.
I did.

1678
01:13:49,711 --> 01:13:50,544
It was like at a bar with ping pong and 
stuff and it was like a kindergarten 

1679
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:53,803
flashback because it felt like the whole
room was already talking and already 

1680
01:13:57,241 --> 01:13:59,600
knew each other and I'm just like,
wow,

1681
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:04,520
there's never a good time to interrupt 
someone and awkward for everyone.

1682
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,373
I think socializing,
I think we all need to acknowledge how 

1683
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:12,310
weird socializing is.
It's so hard.

1684
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:13,810
Hey,
hey guys,

1685
01:14:13,811 --> 01:14:15,910
playing ping pong,
can I get next game?

1686
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:23,080
We've never gone to one of those events 
for the same reasons I avoid.

1687
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:24,640
Yeah.
But,

1688
01:14:24,641 --> 01:14:25,780
um,
did,

1689
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:26,580
uh,
what,

1690
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,990
you're alarmed by how bad your social 
skills are.

1691
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:31,900
I'm just surprised because you have like
social anxiety.

1692
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,940
No,
no,

1693
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:36,670
it's just I have no,
there's nowhere to anything.

1694
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:38,020
Once I'm in a conversation,
it's cool.

1695
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,020
As long as there's something to talk 
about.

1696
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,000
I was like,
yeah,

1697
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,800
it's starting to get that foot in the 
door.

1698
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:43,810
Yeah.
So I pretty much had those things.

1699
01:14:43,811 --> 01:14:47,260
I just literally get a beer and stand 
somewhere in the corner,

1700
01:14:47,261 --> 01:14:48,094
just really.
And people approach me because they 

1701
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:51,280
recognize me.
So that was convenient.

1702
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:54,070
That's nice.
Very nice.

1703
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:57,940
And tell me about the award ceremony.
Did you ever play ping pong,

1704
01:14:57,941 --> 01:14:59,000
by the way?
Did you get a game?

1705
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:03,130
Do you play Ping Pong?
I don't know.

1706
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:04,420
Oh No,
no,

1707
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:05,090
I don't,
you know,

1708
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:05,923
let them go.

1709
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:07,200
It's not that big of a deal.
Yeah,

1710
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,710
it's not that hard.
It's not really that big.

1711
01:15:08,711 --> 01:15:10,210
We could actually is probably pretty 
hard.

1712
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,950
It's hard to be good at like forrest 
gump.

1713
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:13,420
Good.
That's hard.

1714
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:14,650
Yeah.
Um,

1715
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:16,900
but it's,
but pink box really not that serious.

1716
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,150
Um,
how was it accepting the award?

1717
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:22,410
Because I was watching you.
Had you,

1718
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:25,960
you had this great little video you put 
I guess on your website,

1719
01:15:25,961 --> 01:15:28,990
but you never posted on,
on Youtube.

1720
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:31,390
Maybe it was on vine about you being 
like,

1721
01:15:31,391 --> 01:15:34,720
I went up and I told her keep the door 
open because I'm going to be fast.

1722
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,560
That was when I explained pretty much 
half of what I just explained actually.

1723
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:39,653
Yeah.
Yeah.

1724
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:43,150
Um,
tell me about that acceptance.

1725
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:46,270
What will you had a strategy where you 
planning on that quick thank you.

1726
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:47,390
Yeah,
I,

1727
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:48,760
it was a,
it was an option.

1728
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:50,440
It wasn't authentic,
you know,

1729
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,400
because I saw,
like I said,

1730
01:15:51,401 --> 01:15:53,570
I saw Andre 3000 doing it at the 
grammy's.

1731
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:57,010
He had a very strong effect on me for 
some reason,

1732
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:59,530
but it's not,
it's not rocket science and he's not the

1733
01:15:59,531 --> 01:16:00,364
first person who's done that.
I'm surprised more people haven't done 

1734
01:16:02,411 --> 01:16:04,390
that.
Well what more needs to be said.

1735
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,520
Probably some more things could have 
been said,

1736
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:09,460
but I just didn't,
I just didn't have it and it was just,

1737
01:16:09,461 --> 01:16:10,294
you know,
like the ceremony was going on and on 

1738
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:12,574
and everyone's like thanking,
thanking their manager's manager and 

1739
01:16:15,521 --> 01:16:18,370
their social media manager and all this 
stuff.

1740
01:16:18,371 --> 01:16:19,820
I'd never heard of him.
Okay.

1741
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:21,123
But the detail of that story that I love
was that you're walking up to the stage 

1742
01:16:24,221 --> 01:16:25,054
to accept the award and you and there's 
a girl who's got her arm on the door 

1743
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:30,390
that you are planning in your head 
ahead.

1744
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,930
You says,
I don't want to be awkwardly waiting for

1745
01:16:32,931 --> 01:16:36,800
her to open the door for me.
So he says to her as he's going to his,

1746
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,530
he says,
I'll be quick.

1747
01:16:38,531 --> 01:16:40,270
So keep the door.
I wanted her to be,

1748
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:42,370
to have the door right here.
That was pretty slick.

1749
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:45,940
I love the that we can see your thing.
Right.

1750
01:16:45,941 --> 01:16:50,941
And the footage that was you show,
you'd be like that door now.

1751
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:51,923
Where was that something you were 
planning while you were in the audience 

1752
01:16:54,161 --> 01:16:55,240
being like,
if I win,

1753
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:56,860
I don't want to be standing there 
awkwardly.

1754
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,960
A brooding over this I,
yeah,

1755
01:16:58,961 --> 01:16:59,410
I,
I,

1756
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:00,243
I,
yeah,

1757
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:02,170
I know I was going to do as soon as I 
walked into the theater,

1758
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:07,260
I knew I was going to just because I was
all the way in the back to this is we're

1759
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:10,970
just talking about how,
you know,

1760
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,000
antisocial and basically that's okay.

1761
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:15,540
Okay.
I,

1762
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,680
I,
I find it charming.

1763
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,160
Yeah.
I mean it's,

1764
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,350
it's genuine.
Um,

1765
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:20,370
I,
I am very,

1766
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,860
hey,
feel like I have social anxiety.

1767
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:27,220
I feel like I need to draw stuff.
I saw Al Williams interview where he was

1768
01:17:27,221 --> 01:17:28,054
just like doodling stuff while he was 
interviewing because I just couldn't 

1769
01:17:29,741 --> 01:17:30,600
deal with it.
He's like,

1770
01:17:30,601 --> 01:17:32,380
he was like,
thank you for interviewing me.

1771
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,600
I know I need to do interviews and it's 
totally cool,

1772
01:17:34,601 --> 01:17:37,070
but just forgive me.
I just have to just A.

1773
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,540
Do you feel that way?
Is that,

1774
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,860
do you want something to draw?
No.

1775
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,153
Do you feel that way?
And that's like you don't want to do 

1776
01:17:44,111 --> 01:17:46,120
interviews but you feel like at some 
point you have to.

1777
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:47,650
Yeah,
probably.

1778
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:50,350
Yeah.
Is this confronting and kind of like a,

1779
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:53,980
I don't know if it's a fear but like a 
necessity of you being here?

1780
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:55,510
Yeah.
Well it's fun to,

1781
01:17:55,511 --> 01:17:58,000
you know,
so cool.

1782
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:58,923
I mean I love,
I love having the opportunity to speak 

1783
01:18:00,701 --> 01:18:05,701
to your logo is the umbrella.
What's the significance of that?

1784
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,320
Well this is what happened really.
I was doing,

1785
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,560
I didn't on my website,
I had no logo,

1786
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:14,130
I didn't really want one.
So,

1787
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:14,973
but then I was setting up the youtube 
channel and so was setting up the 

1788
01:18:16,361 --> 01:18:17,194
banner,
so had the black background and it says 

1789
01:18:19,721 --> 01:18:20,554
hi,
I think it still says to this day said 

1790
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,310
hi or something.
So that was cool.

1791
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,200
And then,
and then the,

1792
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:29,720
the,
there's a thing in the corner where the,

1793
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,240
there's a thing you have to put in the 
corner.

1794
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:33,040
So I was like okay,
well you got to put something there.

1795
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,000
So I just,
I just put,

1796
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,260
I did it based on what was already 
there.

1797
01:18:35,261 --> 01:18:36,510
So the high thing there.

1798
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:37,713
So yeah,
I just picked what would look good and 

1799
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:40,413
then I realized that that's actually 
gonna be the thing that shows up as my 

1800
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,660
thing,
which was a surprise to me.

1801
01:18:43,661 --> 01:18:44,494
I didn't know.
I just thought it was something was 

1802
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:47,920
going to go in the corner.
But you're happy with the umbrella?

1803
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,120
Yeah,
it's okay.

1804
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:52,450
And I try to use a different color when 
I go to each different platform.

1805
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:54,993
Um,
do you have pet peeves or things that 

1806
01:18:57,121 --> 01:19:00,330
annoy you and pee,
Pee,

1807
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,051
pee?
No,

1808
01:19:01,051 --> 01:19:01,884
I,
uh,

1809
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:04,890
uh,
I dunno probably do,

1810
01:19:04,891 --> 01:19:07,400
but I can't think of them right now.
Uh,

1811
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:10,010
what keeps you up at night?
Um,

1812
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,820
I dunno.
Um,

1813
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:14,603
Geez.
I don't know.

1814
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:15,783
I don't have answers to these.
What gives you the most hope in the 

1815
01:19:19,271 --> 01:19:19,721
world?
This is,

1816
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:24,320
you have a list.
Don't twist Sanya whole list.

1817
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,270
Yeah,
I have a list.

1818
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:26,243
Well,
when I was doing the history of the 

1819
01:19:27,941 --> 01:19:30,100
world research,
I sort of,

1820
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:33,970
I already knew this,
but I sort sort of solidified in my mind

1821
01:19:33,971 --> 01:19:34,804
even more was like the way progress and 
discovery and things getting crazier 

1822
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,310
happens all the time.

1823
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:45,400
You know,
like it was just rocks for like billions

1824
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,233
of years and then something more 
interesting and that it was for a long 

1825
01:19:48,221 --> 01:19:51,250
time and then then something gets 
discovered and then like,

1826
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:56,320
you know,
so and that's been happening forever and

1827
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:57,653
faster and faster.
But do you think about the future in 

1828
01:20:00,181 --> 01:20:01,014
regards to that stuff?
Are you interested in like robotics and 

1829
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:05,760
computer science and space and all that 
stuff?

1830
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:07,680
Yeah,
it's probably going to get really crazy,

1831
01:20:07,681 --> 01:20:09,630
really fast.
Are you a fan of Elon Musk?

1832
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,970
Do you follow all that space x stuff and
Tesla?

1833
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,540
I think he's pretty cool,
but I understand there's some,

1834
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:16,900
I dunno.
Yeah,

1835
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:18,303
I dunno.
Do you?

1836
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:20,610
I love him.
I love Elon Musk.

1837
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,790
I love Elon Musk because I feel like 
he's a.

1838
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:24,683
here's a guy who is fabulously rich.
He is one of the richest people in the 

1839
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:34,680
world and he uses his wealth and his 
influence and his intellect,

1840
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:38,160
in my opinion,
for the betterment of mankind,

1841
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,010
and he and he has to do in a way that's 
profitable obviously,

1842
01:20:41,011 --> 01:20:43,260
because how can you,
but space x,

1843
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:48,960
which is basically just fueling his 
fantasy of starting a colony on Mars,

1844
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:52,140
nearly bankrupted him as did Tesla.

1845
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,020
The guy's been on the verge of 
bankruptcy from gambling.

1846
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:55,883
Everything.
He's got his billions is vast wealth on 

1847
01:20:58,411 --> 01:21:01,170
these insane ideas that everybody said 
was impossible.

1848
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:04,710
Having a private company that sends a 
rockets and outer space,

1849
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:06,480
who would ever do that except the 
government,

1850
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,870
uh,
making electric cars,

1851
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:13,310
zero gas with batteries,
efficient enough to take you through.

1852
01:21:13,311 --> 01:21:14,940
And German people said that was 
impossible.

1853
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,680
I love him.
He's incredible.

1854
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:19,410
Love Him.
He's pretty cool.

1855
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,840
I don't know enough to really.
He's amazing.

1856
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:23,303
But I,
I'm fascinated by the rapid increase in 

1857
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:26,860
Texas.
I didn't even know.

1858
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:29,130
I didn't even really.
I feel like I didn't really explain what

1859
01:21:29,131 --> 01:21:30,090
I was trying to say.
You said what?

1860
01:21:30,091 --> 01:21:33,180
What am I hope that gives you hope?
Yeah,

1861
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:34,800
I don't know.
I have it,

1862
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:36,450
but I don't know where it comes from.
Oh,

1863
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:37,323
you.
You feel like you're a naturally 

1864
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:39,090
optimistic?

1865
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:39,840
Hell yeah.
Yeah,

1866
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,180
yeah,
yeah.

1867
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,270
God,
I wish I had that.

1868
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:46,610
I feel like I'm painfully centered,
cynical.

1869
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,180
Do you think I'm painfully cynical?
You know,

1870
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:52,980
not all the time.
Thank God.

1871
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,390
But you feel like you wake up generally 
have a sunny disposition.

1872
01:21:57,391 --> 01:21:58,560
You're happy.
No,

1873
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,290
no.
I've been worse morning.

1874
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:02,910
Anyone does.
I have morning anxiety I think.

1875
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:03,290
Yeah.
No,

1876
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:05,430
I have crazy morning anxiety.
So what does that mean?

1877
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:09,090
Morning anxiety when you wake up and 
you'd have crazy anxiety just because of

1878
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:09,870
like,
of,

1879
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:12,000
of what?
What are you anxious about or is it just

1880
01:22:12,001 --> 01:22:13,950
a general feeling?
So this show this morning.

1881
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:17,160
Well I don't blame you for that.
I mean it's a new experience for you,

1882
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:19,850
like what you have to do that day,
things like that.

1883
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:21,000
I just.
Yeah,

1884
01:22:21,001 --> 01:22:23,750
I think so.
And when you have that eye opener,

1885
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,250
you know [inaudible].
Yeah.

1886
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:25,770
I don't know.

1887
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:28,110
I want you to get into your work.
You feel more comfortable?

1888
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:29,833
Yeah.
Once I figured out what I'm doing and 

1889
01:22:30,691 --> 01:22:33,060
it's cool.
I feel like that's most people.

1890
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,073
It might be,
I almost wouldn't trust someone who 

1891
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:40,410
would tell me they just wake up happy 
and so pink.

1892
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:41,360
Yeah.
Oh,

1893
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:44,850
thank God I'm alive.
That's kind of how you should be.

1894
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:47,520
Right.
That somehow we're not maybe think,

1895
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:50,640
God,
what a day of wonder.

1896
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:51,683
That's like all those self help gurus 
are like every morning I'm blessed that 

1897
01:22:55,021 --> 01:22:55,854
I'm away.
I think if you really care about doing 

1898
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:03,891
really good stuff and good work and 
really care about making stuff good,

1899
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:05,523
there's to be a flip side of the coin 
because you're going to get really 

1900
01:23:07,031 --> 01:23:07,864
paranoid that it's not going to kind of 
have to a little bit and hopefully it 

1901
01:23:11,891 --> 01:23:13,180
doesn't kill you.
You know what I mean?

1902
01:23:13,181 --> 01:23:14,014
It doesn't kill you.
Do you believe in Ufos or ghosts or do 

1903
01:23:18,581 --> 01:23:19,414
you subscribe to any.
What would be considered as conspiracy 

1904
01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:22,594
theories?

1905
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,330
Ghosts?
You know,

1906
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:29,440
I thought ghosts were pretty cool and I 
looked into some things.

1907
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:33,100
I found like some lists of all the most 
famous ghost sightings and stuff.

1908
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:36,370
I was kinda disappointed.
Most of them were not very believable.

1909
01:23:36,371 --> 01:23:39,850
I thought I was going to find some 
really believable stuff.

1910
01:23:39,851 --> 01:23:43,120
I've heard some stories from people I 
know that are very believable,

1911
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:44,413
so I agree.
Whenever I look into the ghost stuff 

1912
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:47,224
because I am,
I'm happy to accept a naturally 

1913
01:23:50,321 --> 01:23:52,610
skeptical person,
but I agree with the.

1914
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:57,010
The evidence is not compelling yet as of
yet.

1915
01:23:57,610 --> 01:23:59,410
I thought I was.
I was expecting to find it,

1916
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,980
but I didn't use it yet.
What about Ufos and aliens?

1917
01:24:02,981 --> 01:24:05,140
Do you think aliens are out there?
Well,

1918
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,650
I think alien just means someone from a 
different planet than yours.

1919
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:11,680
So I think depending on which planet 
you're on,

1920
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,690
the other person would be.

1921
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,720
Do you think there's interplanetary 
beings that.

1922
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,550
Do you think there's things on other 
planets?

1923
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,590
Of course.
And do you think they visited the earth?

1924
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,720
I don't know about that.
Maybe they have,

1925
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:25,530
but the thing is no,
I don't know.

1926
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:28,960
You think there's intelligent cultural 
beings out in the universe?

1927
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:31,180
Yeah,
there would have to be,

1928
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:32,710
but.
But here's the thing though,

1929
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:36,160
where we're going.
How long have we been?

1930
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:40,900
How long have we been here?
Really like zero time.

1931
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:41,890
This is one of the things I was talking 
about,

1932
01:24:41,891 --> 01:24:44,440
things that are like going super fast,
like we're here and we're,

1933
01:24:44,441 --> 01:24:45,274
I mean I don't know what the future is.
We'll either maybe be extinct or maybe 

1934
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:51,710
we'll invent an entire way out of this 
entire paradigm somehow or,

1935
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:54,010
or invent our way off of this planet or 
something.

1936
01:24:54,011 --> 01:24:54,844
I mean like,
so the chances that I don't know what 

1937
01:24:58,631 --> 01:24:59,320
I'm trying to say.

1938
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,930
The chances that there's another,
like that word,

1939
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,280
the only one what,
what,

1940
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:06,940
what you're.
Or what I think is that the chances that

1941
01:25:06,941 --> 01:25:09,700
we're the only ones here cooking on this
planet.

1942
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,593
It's like lower than the chances that 
there's other intelligent cultural 

1943
01:25:14,531 --> 01:25:18,400
beings on other planets.
I would think they would have to be,

1944
01:25:18,401 --> 01:25:20,860
but there might to be right.
It might be pretty quick.

1945
01:25:20,861 --> 01:25:24,070
It might be pretty temporary and pretty 
quick before they like,

1946
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:25,423
well,
what fascinates me about our time on 

1947
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:32,130
earth is that it took a while to cook us
up like and on earth has been around for

1948
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:33,694
a long time and the dinosaurs were cool.
They were dealt but they weren't really 

1949
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:39,160
going anywhere with science and shit 
like that.

1950
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:40,570
So the media was like,
alright,

1951
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:41,560
you know,
hard,

1952
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,170
hard,
reset that let's throw out the leftovers

1953
01:25:44,171 --> 01:25:45,004
and start over and so I wonder how many 
hard resets before you get someone that 

1954
01:25:49,151 --> 01:25:51,850
can build a spaceship or build a 
computer or something,

1955
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:52,684
you know?
Yeah.

1956
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,000
Didn't take that many.
Only like to,

1957
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:55,863
for us to come pop out of there too.
There was like a several mass 

1958
01:25:58,991 --> 01:25:59,824
extinctions.
Right,

1959
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:00,910
right.
There were like five.

1960
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:03,440
So five resets it took.
Yeah.

1961
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:05,303
Huh.

1962
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:09,990
I'm sorry I'm not more of an expert so I
feel like I'm letting you down.

1963
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:12,930
You're not letting me down.
Um,

1964
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:15,900
I think I was an expert while I was 
making the history of the worldview.

1965
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:18,440
There's new stuff in your head now.
Yeah.

1966
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,393
Yeah.
I think Elan Musk believes were living 

1967
01:26:24,271 --> 01:26:25,940
in a,
an,

1968
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:26,803
a,
a simulation of what he thinks that we 

1969
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:36,170
are living in a computer simulation of 
something else entirely.

1970
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,290
That reality is just a computer 
simulation

1971
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:41,013
of

1972
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,353
I guess.
I guess that would mean that someone 

1973
01:26:44,651 --> 01:26:45,484
else's control,
someone else is controlling it for some 

1974
01:26:47,081 --> 01:26:49,350
reason.
Like if you think of like,

1975
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:50,403
okay,
whatever.

1976
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:53,050
Yeah.
All right.

1977
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,780
Well I'm excited for your live show your
concert.

1978
01:26:55,781 --> 01:26:57,250
That's for there isn't there?
Isn't one yet.

1979
01:26:57,970 --> 01:27:01,870
I'm excited about the idea for the idea 
that you're entertaining.

1980
01:27:01,871 --> 01:27:04,300
The idea is ecstatic to me.
I really want to do it now.

1981
01:27:04,301 --> 01:27:06,130
The problem is that I can't make videos 
at the same time,

1982
01:27:06,131 --> 01:27:08,380
so I don't know how I'm going to say.
Well,

1983
01:27:08,381 --> 01:27:11,410
if you guys want to help out a bill 
words,

1984
01:27:11,411 --> 01:27:13,780
if you want to help support him and his 
work,

1985
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:19,180
please head on over to Patrion.com/bill
words like as a description,

1986
01:27:19,181 --> 01:27:20,290
I'll ask because you won't.

1987
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,300
Okay.
Thank you.

1988
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,400
Thank you that you want everybody 
support bill.

1989
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:27,830
He is a gem.
Um,

1990
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:32,090
and I thank you so much for joining us.
Oh Jeez.

1991
01:27:32,091 --> 01:27:32,924
Thank you for having me.
It was an honor and a privilege and a 

1992
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,640
pleasure.
Likewise.

1993
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:41,060
So guys,
I hope you had a laugh.

1994
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:44,030
He'll be at a giggle opiod were 
fascinated as I was.

1995
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:46,250
Um,
why do we have next week?

1996
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,520
Uh,
it's not a 100,

1997
01:27:50,521 --> 01:27:53,310
100 percent confirmed,
but it's a big one.

1998
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:54,750
If it does work out,
I don't know,

1999
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:55,790
should we,
should we say that?

2000
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:57,360
I think,
I think it is.

2001
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:59,790
I think it's pretty much plant.
I think it's happening.

2002
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:01,790
Jack Black.
Jack Black.

2003
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,590
Very exciting.
Big Fan.

2004
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:04,523
Crazy.
And it's cut and kyle's coming on as 

2005
01:28:06,871 --> 01:28:09,210
well as it just yet.
Uh,

2006
01:28:09,211 --> 01:28:11,910
I think it's just Jack.
I don't think kyle is available maybe at

2007
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:13,080
an unusual time.
Right.

2008
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,550
Well we'll figure it out.
Yeah,

2009
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:15,780
we'll,
we'll,

2010
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:17,700
we'll make a twitter post.
Might be at early one.

2011
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:20,280
Yeah,
right in the morning and it sounded like

2012
01:28:20,281 --> 01:28:21,690
that's the only time I work out,
but yeah,

2013
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:25,240
that looks like it's happening.
So we'll see you.

2014
01:28:25,241 --> 01:28:26,300
I will see you,
uh,

2015
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:27,183
I think an unusual time next week,
but we'll keep you guys posted on the 

2016
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:31,660
twitter account.
And once again,

2017
01:28:31,661 --> 01:28:33,560
is there anything else you want to,
uh,

2018
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,880
talk about a million things but I can't 
remember them.

2019
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:41,053
A belt works on Youtube.
Bill Wirtz everywhere except not bill 

2020
01:28:46,721 --> 01:28:47,554
works on social media because you can't 
get the work well on instagram and on 

2021
01:28:51,181 --> 01:28:52,630
and on.
Not the words.

2022
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,260
Yeah,
that's a great one.

2023
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:56,051
Alright guys.
Well,

2024
01:28:56,051 --> 01:28:59,740
have a blessed weekend.
Enjoy.

2025
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,610
Enjoy being alive and when you wake up 
tomorrow morning.

2026
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:07,620
Thank God off miles.
All smiles,

2027
01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:10,470
baby.
Alright guys.

2028
01:29:10,471 --> 01:29:13,230
Thank you so much for watching.
Have a blessed weekend.

2029
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:15,360
See you next week.
Thank you.
