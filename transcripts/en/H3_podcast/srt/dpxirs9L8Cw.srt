00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,620
Welcome everybody to the h three podcast
lie.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,280
Today's episode is sponsored by hinge 
and hymns.

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,550
Thinking for them.
Today's guest is Tim Heidecker,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,650
the triple threat.
I would even say musician,

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,790
actor,
comedian,

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,230
and my humble opinion,
one of the most influential comedians of

7
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:28,760
our generation.
Can I say that?

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,360
Yes.
The most.

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,780
I would say one of the most.
Okay.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,740
I can't think of a more influential one 
off the top of my head in my life,

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,850
but I can definitely tell you on my part
that I wouldn't be in comedy today,

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,800
I think if it wasn't for your 
[inaudible].

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,610
So we're going to get some fears.
Thank you to that.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,370
Um,

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,690
All right,
well thanks for having me.

19
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,370
Very grateful and very honored to have 
you.

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,220
And yeah,
I know it's always tough.

21
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,890
It's tough to get through that.
What'd you think about that intro?

22
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:10,250
Was it too much?
It was very a sarcastic,

23
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:12,050
I assume not.
And start counting to get off.

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,591
Yeah.
Okay,

25
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:13,110
good.
Sure.

26
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,360
Fuck.
Already.

27
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,670
Fucking with me.
I'm trying to put you at ease.

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,513
You don't want this to be uncomfortable.
I want this to be a positive experience 

29
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:21,070
for you.
Most.

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,460
Most important.
Okay,

31
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:23,570
thank you.
Well that's,

32
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,480
I'm glad to hear that because I have to 
admit that I was nervous.

33
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,440
I mean,
you shoot,

34
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,640
yes,
I was nervous,

35
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:32,630
but I'll tell you why because I wasn't 
sure which Tim I was going to get.

36
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,500
I know.
You know what I mean?

37
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,530
They're real tim or the,
uh,

38
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,063
interview Tim,
the interview Tim that kind of makes 

39
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:43,661
like a parody of we'll see how it goes,
but I feel like

40
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,740
good,
I'm in a different place right now,

41
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,850
really.
Um,

42
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,550
but I,
uh,

43
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,590
I've,
we have some mutual friends and,

44
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:52,720
uh,
and I've,

45
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,623
you know,
I,

46
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,100
I'm,
I'm interested to talk to you in a,

47
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,953
uh,
open and frank manner without any kind 

48
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,180
of aggression.

49
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,520
Well,
that's not necessarily confusion,

50
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,930
but you said you're in a different 
place.

51
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,781
Does that mean,
well,

52
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:09,614
I mean,
I guess I've done a fair amount of the 

53
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,640
kind of Kauffman s uncomfortable,
right.

54
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,920
Interviews,
which are fun sometimes and funny,

55
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,940
sometimes results in funny content.
Absolutely content.

56
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,810
I've enjoyed Washington.
So I feel like I've done that.

57
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,350
I've done enough of that.
Where to keep doing it sometimes becomes

58
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,680
redundant and not as much fun.
And uh,

59
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,600
and now that,
that,

60
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,483
that maybe I've made enough stuff that 
there is interesting things to talk 

61
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:39,194
about.
Maybe it's an interesting experience to 

62
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:44,270
watch me talk about things in more of a 
sincere fashion.

63
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,160
Is it,
is it harder for you to be,

64
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,120
is it easier in a way to do interviews 
under that Kauffman ass kind of?

65
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,470
No,
it's um,

66
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,813
it's actually a little easier to do it 
this way because I'm not worried about 

67
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,800
being in a,
in a bit the whole time.

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,220
But we'll see.
I mean,

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,440
we'll talk it out,
see how this goes.

70
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
I think I have a propensity to be 
amusing without being confrontational.

71
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

72
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,390
So,
uh,

73
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,253
but now we're like very,
it's funny that we're analyzing the 

74
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:17,050
style of interview.
We haven't really talked at all.

75
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,913
No.
Yeah,

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,833
just a little,
I guess we should start before play all 

77
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:22,900
that.
Now that we got that out of the way.

78
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,700
Um,
let,

79
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:25,780
let me,
let me ask you,

80
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,190
thanks for the coffee.
Yup.

81
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,090
God bless.
How is it?

82
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,530
And it's very good.
Cool.

83
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,880
Good balance.
Did they,

84
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,751
oh,
it's black.

85
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,584
So it's kind of hard to mess up.
When did you start drinking black 

86
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:36,940
coffee?
Was that right away or did you,

87
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,220
were you cream first grade?
Wow.

88
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,870
Yeah.
You were sipping coffee at first?

89
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,780
No,
I would try it.

90
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,460
I mean that's a very boring question to 
start off.

91
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,580
Well,
you were getting our feet in the,

92
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,730
uh,
we're tipping our code hair.

93
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,990
You know,
you are good.

94
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,960
Yeah.
Who has the braveness?

95
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,760
The ass.
I think I did.

96
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,150
It was boring,
but I did drink coffee in high school.

97
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,100
It's a diner level,
you know,

98
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:05,490
going and cream and the sugar.
Yeah.

99
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,610
And then,
um,

100
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,350
excuse me.
And then,

101
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:10,930
uh,
I stopped for a long time after a very,

102
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,700
uh,
like anxiety.

103
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,370
Like I drank a lot of coffee.
Um,

104
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,710
I just remember drinking a lot of iced 
coffee.

105
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,580
One at a movie,
right.

106
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,320
A friend of mine and got the full panic 
caffeine,

107
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,630
the panic,
like over caffeinated panic,

108
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,553
uh,
cocaine feeling and then stopped for a 

109
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:30,710
long time.
But then like,

110
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,823
you know,
the past,

111
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,200
I would say 15 years.
I drink coffee in the morning,

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,010
but to get even to get even more in the 
weeds and boring,

113
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
uh,
first of all this an event tonight.

114
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,570
So I usually can't drink coffee after 
the afternoon,

115
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,690
you know,
after lunch.

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,020
Sure.
But now the judge tonight,

117
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,490
so I'm just going to,
I'm going to let myself have some coffee

118
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,890
so I could talk very fast during this 
interview and we can get through it,

119
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,880
right?
Sure.

120
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,940
And I could be full of brain fires off.
What do you have going on tonight?

121
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,570
I'm doing a musical performance for 
Kevin Mcdonald's podcast goes live.

122
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,620
I don't know anything about,
so that sounds gives in the hole.

123
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,310
I do know that show,
but I don't know them on a,

124
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,740
on a name basis.
Yeah.

125
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,730
Are you going to be drinking more 
coffee?

126
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,650
No.
No,

127
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,280
this is the last car you got to come 
down now.

128
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,350
Okay,
let me,

129
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:22,781
I,
okay.

130
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,614
I do want to ask you,
so I feel like myself and many of my 

131
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:31,210
contemporaries are,
are so equally influenced by your work.

132
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,220
How old are you?
I could turn into a co interview cause I

133
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:38,380
don't know very much about absolutely.
You know,

134
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,680
a little bit,
but I don't know the background.

135
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,260
Yeah,
sure.

136
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,093
So if I,
if I apologize cause probably knows 

137
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,960
this,
it's redundant for them now.

138
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:47,910
It's all,
it's all good.

139
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,520
So I might just be curious because I 
thought my own show please,

140
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:54,820
please ask away.
That is totally fine.

141
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,620
But I am,
I'm 32 by 33.

142
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,340
Oh

143
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:58,820
yeah.
Right.

144
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,240
So we're about 10 years apart.
I'm 42 so I would say,

145
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:05,300
well basically people who were in 
college at the time that Tim and Eric,

146
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,830
awesome show,
great job.

147
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,693
You know,
cause that's when I discovered you guys 

148
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,770
and for me,
I remembered the end.

149
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:14,210
I think a lot of people do remember the 
exact moment when they saw your show.

150
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:16,550
Almost like a on nine 11 almost in a 
weird,

151
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,190
it's like wow.
It was that it,

152
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,740
yeah,
it was that formative.

153
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,680
Wow.
So tell me about that.

154
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,420
Um,
I was in college,

155
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,553
three m playing world of warcraft in a 
little shithole apartment by myself and 

156
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:29,510
uh,
I just was,

157
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,344
had adult swim on,
it was like some anime and then on came 

158
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,960
tim and Eric,
not tom goes to the mayor.

159
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,450
No,
I can't see Allen came.

160
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,810
Awesome show.
And it was just the editing,

161
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,130
the colors,
the sketches,

162
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,150
the surrealism.

163
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,210
Where you a fan of where your comedy fan
before that?

164
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,440
Yes.
You like,

165
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,640
what?
Like what would you have been?

166
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,020
Well,
a,

167
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,041
I will,
I love,

168
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,110
and I love Seinfeld.
It'd be frank.

169
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,930
I love Seinfeld.
That's always been my favorite.

170
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,750
I love comedy,
but I wasn't so much,

171
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,620
you know,
and deep right.

172
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,903
But I'll tell you when I saw that and I 
was like mind blown because I didn't 

173
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:09,260
know that you could kind of be funny in 
that way and it was done in a way that I

174
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,740
was like accessible to me in a way.
It seems like you could maybe do it.

175
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,023
Yeah.
And it was Seinfeld didn't feel I can 

176
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:17,294
never do that.
I can never ever do that feels so far 

177
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:20,294
away.
Although do you notice now if you watch 

178
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,610
it on Hulu,
it,

179
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,060
it feels like,
it feels like a set now.

180
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,390
It feels like you're way they stretched 
it or the way they've made.

181
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:34,391
Like I think the problem is that all of 
our tvs are so good that you can see the

182
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:38,360
truth.
I'm walking down that street.

183
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,410
You're like,
all right.

184
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,610
But anyway,
you like Seinfeld,

185
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,341
you fan.
Yeah,

186
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:44,630
absolutely.
It's great.

187
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,610
I could watch that every night.
Yeah,

188
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,620
it's probably crazy.
So good.

189
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Um,
so basically when I saw that I knew in a

190
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:55,790
way that I was like,
Oh man,

191
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,624
I would love to work in company.
All of a sudden that crystallizes video 

192
00:07:58,761 --> 00:07:59,594
game.
And you did like,

193
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,600
yeah,
I put down the video game and I told all

194
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:04,370
my friends about it too.
I will say I was,

195
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,370
I was here.
I was your Messenger.

196
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,100
I was,
I was uh,

197
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,810
always call me is they say I was such a 
fan.

198
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,430
You guys,
all my friends hated it.

199
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,780
No,
all my friends loved it.

200
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,703
Everyone.
I would always find that where people 

201
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:18,960
were like little backhand.
My,

202
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,610
yeah.
It's like,

203
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,530
I need to say that you liked it.
Leave it there.

204
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,950
I love to tell me like these backhanded 
things like I loved your show,

205
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:27,740
but my boyfriend,
he gay too.

206
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,300
That's funny.
Okay.

207
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,340
I don't,
I don't need to know those staff.

208
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,610
That is true.
I get my,

209
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:36,370
uh,
my friend's a huge fan of,

210
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,533
yeah.
Yeah.

211
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,300
Tell me about you come on and buy those 
times.

212
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,290
That was the time when we met and I was 
in Israel.

213
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,563
Anything was here and um,
we were talking over skype like every 

214
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:55,120
day and he would always try to send me 
your guys's sketches.

215
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,800
It wouldn't work in Israel and we will 
always like,

216
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:00,810
I want to see it.
I want to see what you're talking about.

217
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:02,230
It like he couldn't stop talking about 
it.

218
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:04,680
It was forbidden fruit.
It was forbidden fruit.

219
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:06,870
And I think we downloaded a bunch of 
them.

220
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,270
I apologize for that.
I believe they were pirated,

221
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,180
but I was spreading the word.
You don't care a bit.

222
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,820
Torrenting everything.
Um,

223
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,480
at that time that was,
yes,

224
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,583
that was the pirate rotted Israel.
And I remember sitting down in your 

225
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:21,054
sister and being like,
you got to wash this Brownie mountain 

226
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,170
shit.
And she,

227
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,910
she liked it.
Everyone was loving it.

228
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,060
So I'm not one of those guys,
but I had to wait till the question is,

229
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,180
is that that first of all,
you probably hear that a lot from people

230
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:38,580
that you have influenced their comedy.
Do you,

231
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,500
how do you accept that level of praise?
I mean,

232
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,940
do you accept that?
Do you,

233
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,250
uh,
do you know what I mean?

234
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:43,981
Not really.
I mean,

235
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:45,990
not first of all.
I think when,

236
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,840
when we talk about our work,
um,

237
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,733
I,
I,

238
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,720
it is,
it is not just me,

239
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,800
it's just,
it's Eric,

240
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,750
it's John's Krystal.
It's Doug Loosen,

241
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:55,531
hop.
It's the whole,

242
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:59,850
it's a collective of people that made 
that what it was.

243
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,750
Um,
so I,

244
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,890
I'm okay.
It's not,

245
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,300
I don't,
I'm not too,

246
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,650
uh,
you know,

247
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,130
narcissistic about it that I'm,
so this is all me.

248
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:10,080
I'm a part of it.
Um,

249
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,630
but yeah,
we admit we,

250
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:16,890
uh,
so much of that period was making stuff.

251
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,980
It's in such an insular way in such a,
uh,

252
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,863
for ourselves that whether people dug it
or not was kind of not as important to 

253
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:27,414
us.
Right.

254
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,583
And we prided ourself on that,
that we were not doing anything for 

255
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:34,260
fans.
We were not fan friendly.

256
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,540
Um,
not that we,

257
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,410
I mean we,
we,

258
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,100
we were very nice to our fans I think.
And um,

259
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,760
but we weren't trying to please anyone 
but ourselves.

260
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,560
So,
um,

261
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,513
I ended,
it's cool to have because I had that I 

262
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,030
had,
um,

263
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,023
the kids in the hall,
we were talking before the show that I 

264
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,610
like something like the kids in the 
hall,

265
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,683
right.
We're totally a influential to me and 

266
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,960
like,
you know,

267
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:58,794
Saturday night live and all those,
and then you get to meet those people 

268
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,120
sometimes in life and you get to share 
that with them.

269
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,980
And it's nice.
It's definitely nice.

270
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:05,814
I appreciate it.
I'm glad that those people are out 

271
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:09,360
there.
I'm glad you're,

272
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,493
you know,
it usually results in kind of decent 

273
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,100
people too.
Interesting.

274
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,980
I think so.
But I,

275
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:16,814
I think it's interesting what you said 
about that you guys were making it for 

276
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:22,240
yourself cause I definitely think that 
shows the,

277
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,950
almost didn't care about how accessible 
it was.

278
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,010
The anyone that wasn't like initiated or
I don't know how to say,

279
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,920
but it's definitely part of what was 
special about it to what they can.

280
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:35,160
A sense that it was very much your own,
just really your guys,

281
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:35,994
his own thing.

282
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,080
Yeah.
We had our,

283
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,730
a strong,
a sense of what we thought was funny and

284
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,270
we felt like we were delivering to each 
other that,

285
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,590
you know,
we were making ourselves laugh and,

286
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,520
and the,
the stakes were so low.

287
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:51,354
I mean we were on in the middle of the 
night and we were given very little 

288
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,640
money relatively to make something.
Right.

289
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,623
And uh,
so it just seemed like we were most of 

290
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:03,790
the time learning on the,
on the job and making stuff.

291
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,624
And if you use,
especially in the first season you see 

292
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:10,060
stuff that was shot like in the hallways
and like out in front of the office.

293
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:10,894
That was all like probably a lot of that
was like making a first pass at 

294
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:16,750
something and it not working and then 
going like,

295
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:17,584
well,
let's just go outside and shoot 

296
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:19,720
something,
you know?

297
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,943
So we were given just tremendous,
a kind of freedom to experiment and 

298
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,670
figure it out.

299
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,190
What time did originally air on adult 
swim?

300
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,760
It's like 1230 or something like that.
1215 maybe.

301
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:34,490
It was like really fun to tell your 
parents that you have a,

302
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,380
I'm on TV at 1215 on something called 
adult swim,

303
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:41,420
which is what we feel all the time 
wasn't,

304
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:42,750
it really was a couple of years.
Yeah.

305
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:44,450
I had been around for a few years,
but no,

306
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,570
nobody,
nobody still knows what I mean.

307
00:12:47,571 --> 00:12:48,380
Yeah.
It's like,

308
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,870
well rick and I saw your show on comedy 
central.

309
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:51,770
Like,
oh,

310
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,360
they don't even do it on their network.
They saw it.

311
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:54,194
Yeah.

312
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,140
Yeah.
And then it's still like people,

313
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,050
the funny thing this year has been,
um,

314
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,710
this free real estate

315
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,480
meme.
Oh,

316
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,200
we wanted to ask you about that.
That happened.

317
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,210
I don't know.
I mean,

318
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:06,830
it comes out of nowhere,
right?

319
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:09,860
It comes out of the reddit Internet.
Yeah.

320
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,120
And it doesn't count.
It doesn't have any

321
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,993
connection to the work really to the 
original piece or to who I am or 

322
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,194
anything.
And so I had this little part and the 

323
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:24,500
ant man movie and people on the internet
or like,

324
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,633
Hey,
did you know the guy from the free real 

325
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:26,650
estate,

326
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,110
these names?
And No,

327
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:28,740
I didn't,
didn't know.

328
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,020
It's like,
that's so fun.

329
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:32,990
And people get mad about that.
And so it's a weird thing.

330
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:36,020
And this happened to Eric with the 
universe thing and you know,

331
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:37,070
it's like,
it's chill.

332
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,130
Um,
how does that mean?

333
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,973
How does that feel almost to be like,
it's like appreciating a piece without 

334
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:46,130
knowing the origin.
Does that bother you at all?

335
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,840
Um,
it does a little bit.

336
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:48,674
I think it certainly does,
but the also there's a resignation to 

337
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,020
not having any control over that.
So it's become yours,

338
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:57,883
you know,
it's whatever kind of cool too on the 

339
00:13:59,271 --> 00:13:59,940
other.
Yeah,

340
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,741
it's fine.
I mean,

341
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:04,850
I saw a fucking free real estate mural 
somewhere.

342
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,450
I loved that sketch.
I mean,

343
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,300
and like I remember writing it

344
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,183
and like it being such a simple stupid 
idea knowing that you didn't have to do 

345
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:18,700
very much to make it work.

346
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,510
I want to ask you about that specific 
sketch because I'm,

347
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,373
I always wonder like where,
where's your guys' minds when you over 

348
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,180
high?
I mean we just get super,

349
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,230
are you serious?
No,

350
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,490
I feel like that's always the 
assumption.

351
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,343
I didn't assume that.
I didn't think you can't be that 

352
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,430
creative when you're no,
not like that.

353
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,383
No,
I don't remember specifically that idea 

354
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:42,784
of where you're headed with that.
It's really probably comes down to it's 

355
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:49,090
free real estate.
Let's do a commercial where were real,

356
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,610
you know,
probably seeing a uh,

357
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,840
late,
I'm carney,

358
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,430
some real estate commercial and yeah,
making that little turn and then knowing

359
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:01,190
that we could just go in front of a 
green screen for a half hour.

360
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,783
Right.
And we would give it to our boys and 

361
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,560
they would turn it into,
as Doug would say,

362
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:07,790
we give them,
you know,

363
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,080
give him some shit to shine.

364
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,263
Is that what it feels like?
Sometimes because I feel like our style 

365
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,650
is similar years off saving it's Meyer 
from you.

366
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,603
But a lot of times we'll go just fuck 
around in front of a camera and then 

367
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:23,630
it's like I have no idea if that was any
good or not,

368
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,350
but I'm going to sit and edit it for a 
thousand years.

369
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,910
That'll work out.
Hopefully.

370
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:29,923
Yeah.
I think there we've gotten more 

371
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:36,641
efficient without I think and are also 
our style or interest in what we want to

372
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:38,324
make has changed a little bit.
So there's some stuff we've done that's 

373
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:41,834
more conceived and thought out and 
planned and then that becomes pretty 

374
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:48,920
much what you intended.
Bedtime stories.

375
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,910
Yeah.
It was just like holy planned out.

376
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:51,963
It's like not that different than the 
script and great things happen in the 

377
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:57,800
edit but um,
but then yeah,

378
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:58,634
there are certain,
lots of great moments from awesome show 

379
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:01,634
that we're just like,
I dunno fucking put on some crazy wig 

380
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:06,404
and you know,
March around and we'll figure something 

381
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,080
out a little,
a few of those moments for sure.

382
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,480
Um,
Bob,

383
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,680
I,
there's this story,

384
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:16,900
I'm not going to make you tell it cause 
I,

385
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,743
I'm sure you've told us so many times 
about how you guys met Bob [inaudible] 

386
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:22,220
and Kirk and you kind of had,
what'd you call it?

387
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:23,270
Your break?
I mean,

388
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,080
absolutely.
Yeah,

389
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,140
it was your brain.
It was our big break out.

390
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:28,760
Just to paraphrase,
uh,

391
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,623
you and Eric,
when it college scent search for Bob 

392
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,643
owed and Kirk's address,
send him a vhs with some of your 

393
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,110
sketches or was it tom goes to mirror on
the vhs?

394
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:38,991
Yes.
Well,

395
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:41,630
the first little short film Tom goes to 
the mayor.

396
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,750
Okay.
Matt and voice and an invoice.

397
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,200
The DVD or the DVD if,
to me it changed from vhs to DVD in this

398
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:50,140
world that you're ehs.
Oh really?

399
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,570
As we shipped it out.
But Bob loved the,

400
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:54,404
he called you guys up and since then he 
kind of mentored you and get your foot 

401
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:57,680
in the door.

402
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,513
Yes.
So I'm curious now that story is 

403
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:03,800
somewhat famous.
I would say apocryphal.

404
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:05,360
Is that the word?
Uh,

405
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,720
Dan,
can we get a yes,

406
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,063
we're good stuff of legend.
Do you guys get a bunch of Shit in the 

407
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:13,934
mail?
We get a bunch of better call Saul Saul 

408
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,600
Swag.
Yeah,

409
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,380
I was there people who hear that story 
and they're like,

410
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:22,880
you know what a little bit,
yeah.

411
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:27,230
It is a encouraged and,
and certainly through social media,

412
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,900
twitter and facebook,
there's more,

413
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,763
it's easier to get.
It's very easy to get in touch with 

414
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:34,040
Maths v they're easier to get in touch 
with.

415
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,143
Yeah.
And every once in a while there's 

416
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:38,504
something that we see or,
and we also are in the business of 

417
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:42,860
making stuff.
Uh,

418
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,610
our production company makes stuff.
So we are actually kind of on the talent

419
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,440
scout.
Have you,

420
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,130
have you ever found talent

421
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,220
and a similar way that Bob found?
Do you guys oh well,

422
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,260
Vic Berger is a big one,
right.

423
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,870
And Love Dick.
And um,

424
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,330
I was telling you earlier the story with
him where he was,

425
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,164
uh,
making fan videos for on cinema and 

426
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,373
sending them in and they're like these 
music videos he's made that are really 

427
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,340
good songs and funny videos just using 
our footage from the show.

428
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,750
And He,
uh,

429
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,613
so he,
we were just amused by that and we 

430
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,830
contacted him and had him make some 
other stuff.

431
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:26,910
And that set amount of course I think 
gave them a little confidence.

432
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:30,270
It's like all you need is that one 
little like one little boost.

433
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,381
No,
it's so true.

434
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:32,620
And now,
I mean,

435
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,503
today's today as you were touching on,
it's like so easy to kind of get ahold 

436
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,880
of people.
Yeah.

437
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,833
It's interesting that if you ever like 
determined and you're make something 

438
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:43,740
good.

439
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,670
Yeah,
you can get,

440
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,480
you can get I to see it.
You can,

441
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,600
but they're getting,
making something good is,

442
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,170
I think the hard part's the,
uh,

443
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,173
the barrier.
Most people are a reductive of other 

444
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:58,740
people's work or they're not ready yet 
or they don't have the resources.

445
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,180
They're not good enough for us or they,
I dunno.

446
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,570
It's just,
I think it's,

447
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,880
it's good.
I think that there's still a small,

448
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:10,141
uh,
you know,

449
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:10,974
it's not a ton of overly,
incredibly talented new voices still 

450
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,374
like going to be a small one kid out of 
a hundred that's got like this new look 

451
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:20,964
at something.
But,

452
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,400
but there's plenty of funny people.
There's plenty of,

453
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,293
yeah.
You know,

454
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,940
definitely good filmmakers and stuff.
Uh,

455
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,290
speaking of Bob and he's gone on to like
this incredible success.

456
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,630
Has it been crazy to watch because,
yeah,

457
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,660
because that's formation from a comedian
to dramatic actors,

458
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:37,650
but really something.

459
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,420
Yeah.
I mean when we were,

460
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:41,254
he was in a transition period I think in
his life when we met him because he had 

461
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:48,750
come out of doing a couple of pilots 
that didn't go,

462
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:49,584
he was directing a couple of movies and 
I think he was not really sure what he 

463
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:55,800
was going to be doing for them.
And he was helping us and he was helping

464
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:59,910
a bunch of other people get started in 
the business and,

465
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,080
and,
and yeah.

466
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:05,580
So I think the,
he was a,

467
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,410
I don't know.
I mean he's,

468
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,990
he's got a good attitude about it.
I know that.

469
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,690
I know.
He's like,

470
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,010
just happy to have the,
have cool work.

471
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,150
You know,
it gets to do cool work.

472
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:15,984
He's incredible.
I feel that people don't even remember 

473
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:22,350
that he was a comedian at this point 
because he's so the breaking bad guy.

474
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,833
It's all right.
But it's all on me lives because I was 

475
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,330
listening to a Dana carvey was on Howard
Stern.

476
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,673
It was a replay,
but I was listening to it and he was 

477
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:38,181
talking about Odin Kirk writing these 
iconic Saturday night live sketches back

478
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,733
in the Dana carvey years cause he was,
I didn't even know he was involved in 

479
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:45,240
the Odin Kirk and smuggle and Conan 
O'brien.

480
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:48,160
We're all writing like this Saturday 
night live

481
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,310
sketch that that got me into comedy.
He was there.

482
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:54,490
So like he's had these incredible,
you know,

483
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,090
several lives in this business.
Are you,

484
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,090
is that something that kind of appeals 
to you?

485
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:05,230
Because I know you just got cast and the
new Jordan peele movie,

486
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,870
which is awesome,
super excited about you.

487
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:08,883
Is that something that you can see 
yourself kind of doing is making a 

488
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:15,130
switch in a way to a dramatic actor,
which by the way they,

489
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,080
I think you're awesome actor.
I love everything.

490
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:17,651
Dot.
Yeah.

491
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,484
I mean,
I've been lucky to dip into that world 

492
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,300
now.
Uh,

493
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:23,951
every,
you know,

494
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:24,784
a cup.
I weirdly a look at my cmdb page and I 

495
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:29,884
noticed this thing where I've been in 
two movies a year for the past several 

496
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,240
years.
Right.

497
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,710
And it's like a neat,
uh,

498
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,880
kind of thing to try to keep doing it,
you know,

499
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,020
like if I keep doing this and they're 
like,

500
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,100
I'm going to start racking them up,
you know,

501
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,410
like I'll stop making movies.

502
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,850
So,
um,

503
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,560
I've,
this is the first big,

504
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,630
I would say,
big movie where like,

505
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:51,730
you can tell your aunt,
although,

506
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:52,564
you know,
bridesmaids was a big movie that I'm in 

507
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:56,880
for a minute.
But you're,

508
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,753
are you a main or you're not allowed to 
talk about you talk too much about it 

509
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,580
because we're shooting right now.
We're actually shooting.

510
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:04,091
Right.
How about the,

511
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:06,670
can I you,
this is part of the,

512
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,160
yeah,
I didn't sign any big,

513
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,250
this is my big,
it is the first one where like,

514
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,640
they announce you.
There's like a,

515
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,110
there's a thing.
It's like,

516
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,990
you know,
um,

517
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,330
and everyone's excited.
Everyone's excited that this,

518
00:22:23,331 --> 00:22:25,990
that what's his next move is going to be
in that whole thing is neat.

519
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:29,140
But it's a great,
it's a great project to be involved in.

520
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,003
Exactly what is the main and,
but then I'm in the middle of it and 

521
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,400
it's so great cause it's just like 
anything else I do really.

522
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,440
It's um,
you know,

523
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:41,960
every,
the,

524
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,870
the production people are great.
The cast members or everyone's nice,

525
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:51,120
everyone's like warm and,
and collaborative and you know,

526
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,003
Jordan's interested in what I think and 
cold and you just feel like welcome and 

527
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,440
that's relaxing and that's kind of like 
a nice environment.

528
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,410
While I am super excited to see what 
comes of that.

529
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,171
Yeah,
me too.

530
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:05,080
Do you audition for that role?
How did you get the wrong?

531
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,263
No,
I didn't,

532
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,010
I'm curious.
I had a friend write me and like,

533
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,070
he was like,
how the fuck are you doing?

534
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,960
Because he's also an actor and he's 
like,

535
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,730
what are you,
why didn't,

536
00:23:15,731 --> 00:23:18,070
I didn't even know about this part.
Like am I,

537
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,780
and I'm like,
no,

538
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:22,990
I just,
I just got asked to do it because Jordan

539
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:25,230
was interested in you playing this role.
I,

540
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,283
me and mine,
but just writing and that's got to feel 

541
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:28,444
good.
Yeah,

542
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,880
it does.
Pretty amazing.

543
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,743
But you know,
I know him a little bit from the world 

544
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,390
of comedy and stuff,
so I'm not,

545
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,510
and he was such a big fan of the comedy,
the movie,

546
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:41,344
the comedy that um,
it was one of those movies that when it 

547
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:45,800
came out again

548
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,020
was a thing that half the people hated.
And you know,

549
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:52,850
if you look at the reviews of that 
movie,

550
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:56,700
it's like an they're angry,
reviewed and um,

551
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,990
we felt rick and I felt just like beaten
up by the whole thing and uh,

552
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,220
like very proud of it.
But,

553
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,140
but also like furious that,
that,

554
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,423
that these people weren't getting what 
rick was trying to do and all this 

555
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:13,220
stuff.
But what happens is like that movie,

556
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:17,630
people like your age and younger fuck 
fucking like love that movie.

557
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,880
And it meant a lot to them.
And somebody like Jordan is like,

558
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,610
that's one of my favorite movies of your
or of a,

559
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,700
maybe not,
it's his favorite movie,

560
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:31,701
but he thinks of me through that movie.
And so I'm very grateful for that.

561
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,443
You know?
Are you tired of being like loved and 

562
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:36,814
hated?
That's kind of been like the defining 

563
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,360
characteristic of like your career.
I mean,

564
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:41,950
it's always a good,
I've always said that

565
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,140
for years that like if you're not 
pissing somebody off,

566
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,180
you're probably not doing something 
interesting.

567
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,240
Do you have to pay them off all the 
time?

568
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,760
I don't try to know.
You don't mind?

569
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:57,200
I might have in the past probably by 
like,

570
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,010
I mean as a,
as a result of your work of people being

571
00:25:00,011 --> 00:25:01,900
like so frustrated,
they don't understand it.

572
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:02,734
It's like,
do you ever fantasize about making this 

573
00:25:06,811 --> 00:25:08,740
be,
would you like to just spill out?

574
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,970
Everybody loved this.
Yeah.

575
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:10,960
I mean,
not sure,

576
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:11,651
but,
uh,

577
00:25:11,651 --> 00:25:15,160
that's just not in my car really heavy.
I mean,

578
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:17,860
I know,
I would tell you like it never happened

579
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,130
up until,
you know,

580
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:23,220
the first from Tom goes to the mayor.
When that came out,

581
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,670
Eric and I were very excited.
We made our TV show.

582
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:30,420
We thought it was pretty good and we 
went on the message boards

583
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,770
and it was just like,
fuck you really,

584
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,810
these guys have aids,
you know that these guys are f word.

585
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,660
It's adult swim forum.
Where like the message,

586
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,850
I didn't know there was such a tough 
crowd.

587
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,680
Oh my God.
It was like,

588
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:48,050
it was a,
and it was just like a flood.

589
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,363
There was like one after the other.
And that was when we learned that this 

590
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:55,430
is a cruel business.
Um,

591
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,503
I mean like,
I know,

592
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,000
but,
but are macho side was like,

593
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,200
good,
fuck them.

594
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,761
Fuck that.
Yeah,

595
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:02,960
we're,
we're pissing you off.

596
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,510
And then we kind of embrace that a 
little bit,

597
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,373
but it still hurts.
It does hurt cause you just want to be 

598
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:11,414
like,
we made this and make you laugh and to 

599
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:15,110
make us laugh.
I'll say if you don't like it,

600
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:15,810
I mean just,
you know,

601
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,430
here's why you care about,
I mean,

602
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,280
there's plenty of things I don't like.
I don't,

603
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,490
that doesn't make me laugh.
I've never like rage.

604
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,680
It doesn't make me go on the message 
board and say like,

605
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,680
I hate the king of Queens or whatever.
Do you,

606
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,230
are you at the point or do you know,
like,

607
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,873
I'm just wondering like,
do you feel like those kind of comments 

608
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:43,980
don't get to anymore when you get into 
stuff with people

609
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,920
now become,
and that's why I've kind of,

610
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:48,803
I try to get off the,
the social media was telling you I'm 

611
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,910
taking twitter breaks and personal.
Yeah.

612
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,250
Um,
I do take it personally.

613
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,084
I've been honest about that.
They do take it personally and then I'm 

614
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:02,204
in,
there was a cycle now of people who are 

615
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:04,414
like,
I used to be your biggest fan and now 

616
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:08,380
you suck.
And that's like,

617
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,380
that's,
I don't know if that's worse or

618
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,570
well,
how does that feel?

619
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:13,404
I mean like genuinely,
how do you feel when people tell you 

620
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:15,504
that?

621
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,570
Um,
it depends.

622
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,580
Like,
if it's something that's,

623
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,820
that I know is a little risky that I'm 
doing that's a little s self,

624
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:29,730
a little personal or something.
Especially my music,

625
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,250
you know,
I put out my music analytical.

626
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,663
Yeah.
And the and which obviously has a 

627
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:38,310
tendency to people that are,
that get upset about it.

628
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,230
Yeah.
But you know,

629
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,680
it's all personal taste.
And I know the music I make is not the,

630
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,860
it's not popular music anyways.
You know,

631
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:49,710
it's like a kind of music I love,
but it's not,

632
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,720
so people are like,
this sucks,

633
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,770
then I get it.
But I also doesn't,

634
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,250
you never want to hear it.
You don't want to hear that.

635
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,223
Rather not hear it.
And the easiest thing to do is just to 

636
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,260
not repeat it.

637
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,100
Yeah.
That's what I've done.

638
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:08,101
I've been very public about how I,
it wasn't even like that I wanted to,

639
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:11,680
I needed to stop engaging in reading and
comments.

640
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,440
And I've,
and it's funny to say,

641
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,293
but I've seen,
it's been a process for me to unstick 

642
00:28:16,421 --> 00:28:19,780
myself because I've been trying to not 
do it for like a year.

643
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,033
I'd say in the past couple months I've 
been successfully really boris like 

644
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,250
completely.
But like in between that process I would

645
00:28:27,251 --> 00:28:30,280
read comments of like,
and this should just really upset me.

646
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:31,114
Like,
uh,

647
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,180
what do you guys think about h three?
Not Reading comments anymore.

648
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:35,920
It's like,
well it's not doing him any good.

649
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,760
And it's like,
I dunno,

650
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,913
it's funny.
[inaudible] man can read probably 20 

651
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:44,530
positive things.
The cortisone car.

652
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:46,270
I said,
why is that?

653
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,160
Why is that?
I know that too.

654
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:49,890
And it really disturbs me.
Yeah.

655
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,510
I don't know 20 people or like changed 
my life.

656
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,950
I was going to go and heal my son.
I've gotten that idiot.

657
00:28:56,951 --> 00:29:00,310
Nothing.
Oh wait.

658
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,750
I do have the funniest

659
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,640
often the funniest fans,
like especially the cinema crowd.

660
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,740
I love you.
Um,

661
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,663
they're,
they're fucking hilarious and they 

662
00:29:11,111 --> 00:29:11,944
contribute to sort of the,
the jokes and the story in a way that's 

663
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,953
like,
I would want to hang out with a lot of 

664
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:19,880
those people,
you know,

665
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,770
so I don't want to,
it's,

666
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,700
it's uh,
it would be too bad to totally,

667
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,873
I know,
I know Michael Jackson and lock myself 

668
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:32,030
up.
Yeah.

669
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,873
Cause I also tried to completely not 
read anything and I started to feel 

670
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:38,280
really like disconnected from 
everything,

671
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:42,520
which also doesn't feel right.
The large human being is you can meet or

672
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:43,990
it'd be be around.
I mean my,

673
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,340
I try to,
Oh,

674
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:46,360
I'm not on the Internet.
Oh,

675
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:48,460
I'm actually playing with my daughter 
more.

676
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,990
Somehow I'd be like,
oh,

677
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,810
that worked out nicely.
You know,

678
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,830
I'll have the guys filters some comments
to me,

679
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:54,664
but I just feel like it's not a bad idea
is you get like a digest only the good 

680
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,820
stuff and it's like somebody says like,
oh you dive aids.

681
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:02,890
I think you have aids and you're awful 
person and downs.

682
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:04,570
Like this guy didn't,
didn't like the video.

683
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,830
I'm like,
okay.

684
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,460
Right,
right.

685
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,400
You know,
you give you sweet 13 years old.

686
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,100
And when I was 10 years old,
not all of them,

687
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:12,934
but I know I used to do terrible.
And this was when the Internet was just 

688
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:18,530
beginning aol chat room.
I would,

689
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,690
I'll tell you the worst thing I ever did
tell me I went into this soap opera chat

690
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:24,720
room.
Hmm.

691
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,110
Okay.
Like back in those days,

692
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:26,944
you'd have like chat rooms but with,
with topics and AOL and I created a 

693
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:37,171
persona that was like a mom and I 
started typing like,

694
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:39,010
um,
my baby,

695
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,830
my baby's choking,
my baby's choking.

696
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,060
And they were like,
get off,

697
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,440
get help,
you know,

698
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,650
call the ambulance.
I'm like,

699
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,790
what should,
what do I do?

700
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:54,100
She's turning blue and this.
And the joke to us was like,

701
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:56,680
why would I be typing this?
You know,

702
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,560
that's the worst thing you've done.
Huh?

703
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,910
I mean,
gear sweet.

704
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,773
Probably more blocked out praying,
but I think you'd do strike on a good 

705
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:09,190
point is that like sometimes I read 
them,

706
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,183
I'll,
I'll brush over 2080 it's that like me 

707
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,031
and I'll be like,
oh,

708
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:13,990
that guy dislikes me.

709
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,973
But the thing you don't know about that 
guy because it's the fucking internet 

710
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,243
and a could be a 10 year old.
It can be a 10 year old where it could 

711
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:22,990
be the same guy 10 times with 10 
different accounts.

712
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,160
Right.
Anyways,

713
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,670
let's stop talking about this because 
it's,

714
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,080
it's,
I can't imagine.

715
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,243
Well,
it's relatable to most people listen 

716
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,380
because when you want to go back talking
about coffee.

717
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,380
No,
I'm just saying like if you're a guy out

718
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:41,950
there with 10 followers who wants to 
make stuff,

719
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:42,784
he's like,
I'd be so happy to have people hate my 

720
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:46,920
work if they would actually.
Does.

721
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,210
The grass is always greener at any way.
We are at a perfect time for a break,

722
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,520
but we've got a ton of more questions 
coming up.

723
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,440
Guys.
Do not go away.

724
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,410
We will be right back after this short 
commercial break.

725
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,160
Thank you.
To hinge for sponsoring this episode.

726
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:12,430
Hinge is a dating app that promotes 
healthy relationships of all kinds.

727
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:17,050
It's a dating app for people looking for
a real relationship with a partner.

728
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,033
Now I'm a married man,
so I was browsing hinge with Dan and I 

729
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:22,744
got to say,
compared to what I've seen of other 

730
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:25,150
dating apps,
it's better.

731
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,500
Okay.
Just straight up.

732
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:27,334
There's more information.
It's a less superficial and there's a 

733
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:31,330
perfect balance between seeing,
okay,

734
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:32,200
look,
I met you.

735
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,180
Gotta be attracted to the person.
That's important,

736
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,950
but you want to know a little bit more 
about,

737
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,020
or they cute.
What are they into?

738
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:38,854
What kind of hobbies do they have?
All this stuff is perfectly presented 

739
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:44,450
there before you give them that 
proverbial swipe and to oblivion.

740
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,530
Okay?
Now,

741
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:46,364
why should you believe me?
That hinges better and offered to 

742
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,580
healthy relationships.

five stars by real users.

It's taking for the hairs on your head.

754
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,620
You Bald Sob,
right?

755
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,420
66% of men lose their hair by age 35 my 
question to you,

756
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,460
what are you going to do about it?
Okay.

757
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,100
Here's the thing.
It's easier to keep the hair.

758
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:37,934
You have them to replace it and once 
you've ordered last tick tock the sweat 

759
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,310
dripping down your forehead,
yet you'll vault son of a gun.

760
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,310
It's a hairline.
Slowly starting to move backwards.

761
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,100
Any bald spots they making me read?
This is something really mean.

762
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,660
I'm just,
I'm going with it,

763
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,620
but it's true guys,
because I will tell you from a year from

764
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,453
now,
is it going to be usual business as 

765
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:59,600
usual up there or are you going to be a 
bald fucking George Castanza ass looking

766
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,520
motherfucker.
Okay,

767
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,220
I love George,
but he's insecure.

768
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:05,810
He's bald and he,
okay,

769
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,733
that's not the point.
Do you want a bald spot or do you want 

770
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:10,550
to do something about it?
You can stop the ticking.

771
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:11,384
Thank you.
Do you want your headlight to recede or 

772
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:15,140
do you want to do something about it 
first?

773
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,183
Why do you guys turned to weird 
solutions or do nothing when they could 

774
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:23,210
turn to medicine and science?

it's so frickin easy.

787
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,640
Answer.
A few quick questions.

788
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,474
Doctors will review and prescribe you 
products are shipped directly to your 

789
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,740
door.
Here's the call to action,

790
00:35:06,741 --> 00:35:07,574
so listen to f up order.
Now my listeners get a trial of for 

791
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:12,620
fruit of hymns,
not for free,

792
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:15,920
for $5.
Scratch that and put $5 instead today,

793
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,020
right now,
while supplies last,

794
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:23,050
that's four hymns and dotcom slash h.
Three you get a month trial for just $5.

795
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:25,844
This would have cost $100 if you went to
the doctor of pharmacy and it'd be 

796
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:29,900
humiliating.
Now you do it online.

797
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,890
No problem.
No trouble,

798
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:32,290
baby.
Go to Ford,

799
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,050
[inaudible] dot com slash atria that's f

802
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,640
We're back with a great tim.
I notes we might occur and,

803
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,873
well,
what I want to say is go on over to Tim 

804
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,310
heidecker.com/events
to crush the site.

805
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,563
Don't blow it up guys.
Get some tickets to my decker and Greg 

806
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,300
Turkin 10 art cinema,
live experience,

807
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,710
live,
live.

808
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,573
It's an experience.
It really is basically an off Broadway 

809
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,090
show.
There's a head on over.

810
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,870
Um,
we,

811
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,320
we were just talking about on cinema.
Yes.

812
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,360
Which is such a,
it's been such a wild ride.

813
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,340
And then,
yeah,

814
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,680
my question with aunt cinema enough for 
you guys that don't know,

815
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,680
started as a movie review,
it's still is essentially broke,

816
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,700
but it was this two couple of guys doing
films,

817
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,010
but he's been a lot of twists,
a lot of turns.

818
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:37,140
Yeah.
A couple of tribulations.

819
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,723
Was it always your intention from the 
beginning that it would have this kind 

820
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:44,120
of story arc to it?
Kinda just as it went?

821
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,720
No.
The story there is,

822
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,870
um,
greg and I were both on the comedy,

823
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:50,704
the movie,
the comedy that we talked about earlier 

824
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,690
and as you do with movies,
uh,

825
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,380
you have a lot of downtime.
Um,

826
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,263
there was this feeling that summer of 
there being kind of a overabundance of 

827
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,550
podcasts,
medians,

828
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,403
just the mark Marin thing had been kind 
of blowing up and there was just this 

829
00:37:08,981 --> 00:37:13,981
like to greg and I at least,
it felt like there was too many voices,

830
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,370
po piping in about garbage,
you know.

831
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:21,610
And uh,
so we had the just idly out of,

832
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,170
we had this idea of doing this movie 
review thing and we did it on my phone.

833
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:29,650
So like the first five episodes of the 
podcast are these three minute,

834
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:31,600
like,
let's talk about ghostbusters.

835
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:32,434
And then like,
not really knowing much about Ross 

836
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:36,760
busters and it was just kind of,
but we,

837
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,893
yeah,
we started doing longer versions of 

838
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:40,510
that.

839
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,990
And in that setting,
when we're back in La and my studio,

840
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:49,210
we'd developed kind of a couple of 
personas that started developing there.

841
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,621
And then,
yeah,

842
00:37:50,621 --> 00:37:54,220
I think we realized that these guys had 
a,

843
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:59,490
that we could tell stories through these
episodes that could be talked about.

844
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,520
You didn't have to actually see happen.
You know,

845
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:07,450
you could just say what kind of what we 
did off camera be talking about them.

846
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,090
And you could almost create these,
this,

847
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,223
these,
this drama that you didn't have to 

848
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,670
actually shoot.
We're actually produce,

849
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
um,
became like a radio play.

850
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:18,934
And,
um,

851
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,230
and it just kind of naturally happened 
just to probably fill,

852
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,273
because we didn't want to just make it 
this one joke of a guys who probably 

853
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:30,040
haven't seen the movies giving good 
reviews.

854
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,230
Um,
so yeah,

855
00:38:32,231 --> 00:38:35,860
it became kind of after a couple of,
I think we,

856
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,550
we saw what the potential of these two 
characters and it could,

857
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,570
it could go anywhere.

858
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,360
And it's been the,
I think,

859
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,550
the most fun,
um,

860
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,830
creatively stimulating project for me.
Yeah.

861
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,120
Wow.
Yeah.

862
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,610
Just because it,
uh,

863
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:58,570
it's such a fun character to be,
and it's a,

864
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:00,100
and,
and Greg really is,

865
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,250
I think,
the funniest person in the world really.

866
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,740
He's a great foil.
I mean you guys,

867
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,670
and uh,
so,

868
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:10,720
and it exists on this,
in this a form that like it can exist on

869
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:11,920
twitter.
It can exist,

870
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,500
um,
in the show itself.

871
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,360
Law,
it can be this,

872
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,663
this soap opera.
It's like we've gotten to make a soap 

873
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:22,660
opera that can go forever.
And that's true.

874
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,310
And that's uh,
that,

875
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:26,980
that is very liberating.
And um,

876
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,303
you know,
lot actors can die and come back as 

877
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,693
well.
The culmination of course they have of 

878
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:36,570
the recent,
yeah.

879
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:41,870
Arc being the trial for murder or those 
20 vanquis parcels.

880
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,220
Yeah,
that was incredible.

881
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,050
That really wasn't,
I've never seen anything.

882
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,970
I've genuinely never seen anything like 
that.

883
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,120
I know,
and I hate like being like,

884
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:55,180
so boy,
so kind of boastful of my own stuff.

885
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,130
Sure.
But somebody has to,

886
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,030
I know I am,
but,

887
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,873
and again,
it goes back to the thing I was saying 

888
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:01,594
earlier with awesome show.
It's this collaborative thing that I'm 

889
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:05,840
so proud of,
Eric [inaudible],

890
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,753
Nicola who directs it and writes with us
and Greg and our producer Andrew and 

891
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,970
these people that make that possible.
Um,

892
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,280
so I feel like it's my job to come out 
and help you got up.

893
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,680
But it does feel like we put that out.
We put,

894
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,910
we made that and I've heard it from 
people like you and we feel it.

895
00:40:24,911 --> 00:40:26,310
We're like,
this is what,

896
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,183
there's nothing else like just,
and the concept alone of seeing you're 

897
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:34,660
saying in a court room and playing it 
like straight straight.

898
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,853
But then people like Boden,
Kirk who is always sort of checking in 

899
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:43,120
with me and I'm checking in with him 
about stuff,

900
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,830
you know,
he wrote me just being like,

901
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,200
this is like the best thing I've seen 
you do.

902
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:48,034
And for in a long time that,
that Ma that's exciting to me cause I'm 

903
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,300
like,
yes,

904
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:54,370
I feel that way too.
Uh,

905
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,700
but it's also a thing where it's like,
it doesn't get,

906
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,750
it doesn't get treated like anything 
else either because it's not,

907
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,960
you know,
I don't care about awards or anything,

908
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:08,030
but like it isn't a TV show.
It's this thing that,

909
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:12,520
that people end up watching on youtube 
as it's five hours folks.

910
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:13,354
So it's like,
it's like it's a thing that you have to 

911
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:18,550
commit to,
but I don't know.

912
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,960
We're extremely proud of it and want to 
do more things like that.

913
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,590
Cause we're like,
oh this is the fun about other,

914
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,433
had other people have said like what a 
great environment to do comedy and just 

915
00:41:29,471 --> 00:41:32,260
as a trial where,
you know,

916
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:33,800
you,
you just set up in the,

917
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,700
it was so fun to make because we just 
did it in a courtroom.

918
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,860
Uh,
that was unused.

919
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,150
It was like,
you know,

920
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,350
it'll real courtroom that had been I 
guess abandoned or something.

921
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,480
But um,
but we just said,

922
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,760
you know,
like this year he set up at five cameras

923
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,570
and then just did this play every day 
for like three days.

924
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,570
Unless you guys plan it out.
It was planned out.

925
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,520
Yeah.
It was pretty planned out.

926
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,770
Um,
but not,

927
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:01,843
I would say not written,
not dialogue written between he got 

928
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:05,181
planned.
Yeah.

929
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:08,960
Cause we had,
we had cast people that knew not to give

930
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:09,794
too much away,
but we,

931
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,750
we cast people that knew how to behave 
in that environment and let them,

932
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,270
and by the end of the couple of days,
I mean,

933
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:20,040
everybody was like,
this is so fun because we're,

934
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,083
we're,
we're just,

935
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,400
we're playing.
It's playing.

936
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,263
You're playing.
Yeah.

937
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,470
And,
um,

938
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,420
if there was an outtakes version of 
that,

939
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:29,930
you'd see much,
lots of like crying,

940
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:30,764
laughing,
lots of,

941
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,150
yeah.
Lots of like what a read them

942
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,130
deal with.
Do you have think about like how do we,

943
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,600
how do we,
this is so good and I'm so proud of it.

944
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,140
How do we get more people to watch this?
I,

945
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:40,520
yeah,

946
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,353
I mean it's very,
it's always,

947
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,900
especially with on cinema,
it's been this sort of frustrating.

948
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,350
Um,
it's not for everyone,

949
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:53,090
but the people that love it,
I'm really care about it and,

950
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,660
um,
support it in different ways and,

951
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,100
and feel like it's the greatest thing.
So I'm happy for that.

952
00:43:01,101 --> 00:43:02,990
I wish it was,
you know,

953
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,240
millions of viewers,
but it's,

954
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,970
it's,
I understand that it's a,

955
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:10,520
uh,
it's a contentious dry,

956
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,403
um,
watching bad people watching of 

957
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,190
negative.
It's not,

958
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,840
it's like a,
it's a kind of comedy that's like that,

959
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:18,674
that kind of buy all this kind of grow 
like not gross but just kind of like 

960
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,643
creates uncomfortable experiences and 
that's been our whole career in various 

961
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:28,754
forms.
So I understand that some people maybe 

962
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:32,624
have enough shit going on in their real 
life that they don't have the luxury of 

963
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:38,690
just like relaxing to that kind of humor

964
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:44,470
that you guys have always had that 
fascination with like an end and you see

965
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:47,590
it in the other shows that you guys 
produce as well.

966
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,610
That absolutely made yeah.
As a real focus on like discomfort,

967
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,430
cringe for lack of a better word.
You know,

968
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:56,883
what is that?

969
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,090
I,
I mean I don't know it,

970
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,380
it comes probably from the kind of 
comedy we liked.

971
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,420
Some of it,
some of it like,

972
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,340
you know,
Albert Brooks,

973
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:11,450
like Albert Brooks is a lost in America 
movie,

974
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,313
which I think is maybe my favorite 
comedy film is every scene is that kind 

975
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:18,560
of scene that makes your stomach kind of
hurt.

976
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,050
It's tenses you up.
It's like,

977
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,000
oh no,
don't,

978
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,540
I don't go there.
Don't say that.

979
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,790
Um,
so some of that,

980
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,070
there's some of that.
Um,

981
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:28,933
most of it's probably though just create
in awesome show at least like creating 

982
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:35,230
absurd situations that,
um,

983
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
go dark for very,
um,

984
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:42,090
not very logical reasons are real 
realistic reasons,

985
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,100
but yeah,
I don't know.

986
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:44,700
It,
it's,

987
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,050
there's something,
I think it's also like a,

988
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:48,884
a,
a fundamental comedy construct of 

989
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:55,050
failing is funny of,
of some of failure.

990
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:58,340
Um,
like slapstick comedy is,

991
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,313
is violence and you know,
somebody slipping on a banana peel or 

992
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:07,190
falling down stairs is essentially them 
failing somewhere out,

993
00:45:07,191 --> 00:45:08,024
you know?

994
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:13,150
And so we're doing it on more of like a 
emotional level sometimes it's just,

995
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,270
nothing's funny about like people things
going well.

996
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,240
I don't think I like to see an attempt 
at that,

997
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:22,470
but I feel it.
Yeah.

998
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:23,304
I mean there,
there was kind of comedy that's like 

999
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,333
people being clever and smart and that 
and witty and quick and that's a 

1000
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,870
different kind of comedy that I didn't,
I'm not that.

1001
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:35,680
I Love Big Bang if,
yeah.

1002
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,060
Quippy and cute.
Well,

1003
00:45:39,061 --> 00:45:39,894
let me ask you about absolutely because 
I'm a huge fan of everything you guys 

1004
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:44,484
produce.
I mean,

1005
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,473
predominantly you guys have two huge 
shows right now that I think a lot of 

1006
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:49,230
people are talking about,
which is the Eric Andre show.

1007
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,073
Nathan for you.
I want to ask you questions about the 

1008
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:54,210
shows,
but how are you involved like personally

1009
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:56,010
in the planning conception of these?

1010
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,420
Not,
not very much at all.

1011
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,240
Really.
No.

1012
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,760
Were pretty removed.
Our Pr,

1013
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,700
our producing partner,
Dave kneebone,

1014
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,661
uh,
you know,

1015
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:04,770
we started,
he,

1016
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:08,420
he's a little more involved than we are,
but we,

1017
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,463
we essentially started the company in 
this second season of Tom goes to the 

1018
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:13,974
mayor because we had terrible 
experiences with another production 

1019
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:19,240
company.
Um,

1020
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,750
and really saw that there wasn't much to
it.

1021
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:23,940
You just needed to kind of like hire a 
manager,

1022
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,313
you know,
and get somebody to manage that kind of 

1023
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,613
that side of the books.
So we started that just to produce our 

1024
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,400
own stuff.
And then,

1025
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:34,260
um,
after awesome show wrapped,

1026
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:36,290
we won,
we,

1027
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,470
Eric and I needed to take some time 
because we wanted to make a movie and we

1028
00:46:40,471 --> 00:46:44,370
needed to kind of write the movie and,
and think about it and develop it.

1029
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:45,204
And w another show came in that was 
looking for a producer and that was the 

1030
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:51,840
John Benjamin has a van show.

1031
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,140
And that,
uh,

1032
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:55,650
that for our,
from our perspective,

1033
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:58,530
it was,
we could keep all of our talented people

1034
00:46:58,531 --> 00:46:59,364
working while we went off and did 
something that didn't require their 

1035
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,993
services for a few months.
So it kind of created a gap and then it 

1036
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:08,340
just became,
you know,

1037
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,953
holistically out of that.
Like I know Nathan Nathan actually was 

1038
00:47:12,631 --> 00:47:14,400
on that,
the Jon Benjamin show.

1039
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,833
And so he got to know dave or producer 
and he pitched his show to us and you 

1040
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:22,080
know,
just try it,

1041
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:24,210
let's go wrong.
So I,

1042
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,070
it's,
there's some maybe a let down,

1043
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:29,690
but we just,
we do what we offer with the company is,

1044
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,993
is the opportunity that we had,
which is sort of creative freedom and 

1045
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,043
nobody telling you nobody budding in 
with their ideas and notes everything 

1046
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:41,860
that you guys practice doesn't have a 
quality till it.

1047
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,170
Yes.
I mean it's a lot of the similar,

1048
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:47,950
it's a lot of same blood,
same editors is that a group of talented

1049
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:51,640
people at work and a lot of them started
with awesome show and came out of,

1050
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:52,923
I mean most of the people that are 
editing and directing have come out of 

1051
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:58,743
the,
most of the people have edited and 

1052
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:00,724
directed the shows that you probably 
like our had worked on awesome show 

1053
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:09,000
basically or check it out or you know,
something like that.

1054
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,450
I mean,
if it's funny you look at,

1055
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,910
we didn't produce the new Sasha Baron 
Cohen show,

1056
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:13,750
but I,
yeah.

1057
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,200
But if you look at the credits of that,
there's like four guys,

1058
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,520
Nathan,
Nathan,

1059
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,373
buddy,
Eric,

1060
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Nicola who directs all the awesome,
all of a on cinema and decker,

1061
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:25,960
um,
and was,

1062
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:28,210
and also worked on new.
These are your employees.

1063
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,120
They w they have been at points.
Yeah.

1064
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:33,820
Um,
there'll be freelancers mostly,

1065
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:35,860
but,
um,

1066
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:36,400
just,
you know,

1067
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,900
it's like a small group of guys,
you know,

1068
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,930
mostly guys,
um,

1069
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:46,170
come editors and producers and writers.
You make like an editorial decision,

1070
00:48:46,811 --> 00:48:48,880
like on a pitch.
Like if Nathan's like,

1071
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:50,140
Hey,
I've got this concept.

1072
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,220
I don't,
you don't know.

1073
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,470
No,
I mean nothing to do with it.

1074
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,120
Oh,
what shell,

1075
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:55,750
what's,
you know,

1076
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:56,460
what,
what,

1077
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,960
you know,
how does absolutely decide what it wants

1078
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:00,070
to produce?
Oh,

1079
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:01,120
we don't decide.

1080
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:01,953
I mean,
we,

1081
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,240
we don't have that,
that luxury.

1082
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,920
Uh,
we have people,

1083
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,200
I mean,
people now we do a little bit,

1084
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:11,110
but we take,
people come in,

1085
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:12,690
pitch us ideas.
Uh,

1086
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:16,900
we sometimes have,
you know,

1087
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:17,734
were developed.
There are certain things or like Nathan 

1088
00:49:19,731 --> 00:49:23,530
show is really what Nathan wants to do 
and it's his vision and you already know

1089
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:24,364
him and we know him and we,
and then you've involved a network like 

1090
00:49:27,191 --> 00:49:31,840
comedy central who has their say.
So the last thing they want is us.

1091
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:32,703
I mean,
of the conversations I've had with 

1092
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:37,300
Nathan about his show have been like,
um,

1093
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:38,403
some,
some stuff having to do with like 

1094
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:40,234
promotion and marketing where he wanted 
my advice on certain that side of it 

1095
00:49:43,811 --> 00:49:46,780
sort of like how to handle the war,
getting whatever,

1096
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:49,270
you know,
what the network wants me to do this,

1097
00:49:49,271 --> 00:49:50,104
what do you think?

1098
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,453
And then watching some rough cuts,
giving maybe a couple of thoughts that 

1099
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,390
aren't certainly aren't required.
Yeah,

1100
00:49:58,391 --> 00:49:59,470
I mean,
so,

1101
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:00,903
um,
no we're just just saying we're glad to 

1102
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:05,470
have our names attached,
but you know,

1103
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,470
I want environment.
I think our,

1104
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,423
our office creates a,
just like a good environment for those 

1105
00:50:12,071 --> 00:50:14,350
kinds of people to feel creative.
Yeah.

1106
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:17,890
I wonder if you're not giving yourself 
enough credit in this situation.

1107
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:22,750
I swear to God,
let me ask you this then in that case.

1108
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,370
Well at any rate,
love him.

1109
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,920
Thank you.
And keep doing.

1110
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:31,060
You're doing what's,
what's the story behind this?

1111
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,320
I've always wondered what the hell is 
going on.

1112
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:34,400
Well,
that's my dad.

1113
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,513
I see the resemble.
How do you not know that common 

1114
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:39,944
knowledge?
It's sort of common knowledge for the 

1115
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,940
people.
Probably all.

1116
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,180
Yeah.
Oh,

1117
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:48,940
there's all sorts of stuff.
Let's close up.

1118
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,760
So that's your dad.
That's home movies from the that day,

1119
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:55,903
which was 1989 whatever it was.
I was in Florida and I was going around 

1120
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,683
with the video camera asking my family 
to describe this vacation in three 

1121
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:07,510
words.
That was pretty quick,

1122
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,420
switch hats,
a little bit high or something.

1123
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:14,540
He said,
absolutely.

1124
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,020
And then when Eric and I were just 
starting making videos,

1125
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:19,303
I had recently gotten all these video 
tapes transferred or something and we 

1126
00:51:23,271 --> 00:51:24,104
were looking through them.
I was looking through them and there 

1127
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:30,770
were a few moments where I was like,
this is great gold right now.

1128
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,023
And one of them was that,
one was my poor sister at a recital 

1129
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:39,401
singing some song from fiddler on the 
roof and her like pho.

1130
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,930
Totally fucking up a second verse.
And we didn't use that for anything.

1131
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:47,060
But um,
yeah,

1132
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:47,923
that's it.
And then that just became pretty early 

1133
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,470
on our slate and it has not changed.

1134
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,660
That gets a little,
he likes it.

1135
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,123
He takes it.
I think he gets a little residual check 

1136
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,120
as he getting a little,
a little,

1137
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:04,460
but I think it might be format.
There was a sketch,

1138
00:52:04,461 --> 00:52:05,294
we did an awesome show.
It was my funeral and it was when I was 

1139
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:12,950
dead and I had this great bloated face 
and uh,

1140
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:17,390
we had my dad and mom make a like a 
video eulogy for me.

1141
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:19,740
That's really funny.
Oh that was your actual pants?

1142
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:21,880
Yeah,
it's still getting a little,

1143
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,120
I think he gets a little,
a couple of cents out of that.

1144
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,710
That's finally allowing.
It looks fine to me cause he,

1145
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:31,130
he did this the most sort of insincere 
like,

1146
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:35,680
oh well we wish you the best and take it
easy,

1147
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,890
you know,
take care and we'll,

1148
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:40,190
you'll be missed.
And just like really insincere though.

1149
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,530
Funny.
Tell me how,

1150
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,560
how was your relationship with your dad?

1151
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,940
You got a lot of dad jokes,
dad jokes in your content,

1152
00:52:49,941 --> 00:52:51,930
which I'm a big fan of,
you know about that debt.

1153
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,020
Want to meet that dad?
Yeah.

1154
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,380
It was mutual with Eric and I,
we both had this sort of a,

1155
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,230
we love our dads.
Um,

1156
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,180
we could,
I think we have a good relationship with

1157
00:53:02,181 --> 00:53:04,910
our dads have a better relationship with
his dad.

1158
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:06,543
Um,
no,

1159
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:10,490
but um,
I think we've just always,

1160
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:11,343
it's been a funny,
it's kind of weird cause it's now kind 

1161
00:53:13,431 --> 00:53:18,431
of like a common understanding comedy,
comedy concept of Dad.

1162
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,270
The jokes,
you know,

1163
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:24,590
you see that like once something gets 
into like the world of like Levi's jeans

1164
00:53:24,591 --> 00:53:27,090
or you know,
stuff,

1165
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:27,691
it's like,
yeah,

1166
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:32,280
it's fully matured into its own.
But for us it was just something,

1167
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:33,363
there's something awkward about the 
relationship and adult man has with his 

1168
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:38,360
dad and he's like,
it's,

1169
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,020
it can be,
it can be awkward.

1170
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:40,854
It can be just like,
well now we're just two adult men were 

1171
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,070
in,
have different tastes.

1172
00:53:47,071 --> 00:53:47,904
And I dunno,
it was just something as me now being a 

1173
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:51,630
dad,
I get it too.

1174
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:53,580
It's like,
um,

1175
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,400
you feel a little unnecessary.

1176
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,260
Oh,
little holiday.

1177
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,103
Your kids,
you can't be on my category three and 

1178
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:04,343
no.
Uh,

1179
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,500
no.
Uh,

1180
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:08,730
for,
uh,

1181
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,953
no,
she just turned my daughter Amelia just 

1182
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:16,200
turned five yesterday and I have had a 
little birthday.

1183
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,613
Just kidding.
And then I have a son who's about to 

1184
00:54:22,561 --> 00:54:24,240
turn two.
And Toby,

1185
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:25,500
what a wonderful,
I mean,

1186
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:27,870
how was it,
how was a fatherhood?

1187
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,550
It's great gains,
cheer game.

1188
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,333
Mesic changed your sense of comedy of 
what's funny and kind of giving you a 

1189
00:54:33,631 --> 00:54:34,770
nail.
Not really.

1190
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,790
Same Old,
same old.

1191
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,560
I know I'm,
when Amelia was born,

1192
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:41,220
if you look at the third or third season
of check it out,

1193
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,560
there's diaper,
there's a diaper joke.

1194
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:44,423
And that's,
I think one of the funniest things to 

1195
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:47,754
ever,
but it's right out of the experience of 

1196
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,280
being,
having diapers in my life.

1197
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,233
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1198
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:55,423
It's,
it's brule changing a grown an adult 

1199
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,950
man's diaper and pissed on.

1200
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,690
Um,
I want to go back.

1201
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,280
I got this,
you'll have this video,

1202
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:06,863
the cat film festival.
I want to ask you some questions about 

1203
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:10,890
it.
So this was,

1204
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:12,750
if I can pop this,
oh my God,

1205
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,620
look at this little,
a little long way.

1206
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,760
So it looked like a monk.
A little funk.

1207
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,653
Yeah,
I look at it obviously cut my own hair 

1208
00:55:21,271 --> 00:55:25,080
or something.
So deviant cut the brow seems very heavy

1209
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:26,670
and yeah,
it was well lit.

1210
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,300
It's clearly well lit.
Um,

1211
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,340
this was this the first,
what's the history on this video?

1212
00:55:32,341 --> 00:55:34,800
Cause I'm not quite sure it was the 
final,

1213
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,910
uh,
project that UN,

1214
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,033
no,
we had been out of college by this 

1215
00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:41,460
point.
I was living in New York,

1216
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:42,893
uh,
with my girlfriend that was our bedroom 

1217
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:46,403
and we an eric would come up from philly
and I would go back to philly and we'd 

1218
00:55:51,151 --> 00:55:55,740
make stuff sort of recreationally for 
fun.

1219
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,370
Back in the days when it was fun to make
stuff,

1220
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,570
no one was paying attention.
There was no chat rooms and there was no

1221
00:56:03,571 --> 00:56:05,850
message boards.
Um,

1222
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,470
but we did I think have this idea to 
actually do this cat film festival.

1223
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:11,304
It was,
we're coming out of like the 

1224
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:16,500
Philadelphia art world a little bit like
I'm out of college.

1225
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:21,501
It was a lot of like trying to like a 
lot of festivals and pr and projects and

1226
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,963
sort of like arts events.
I think we were kind of into but also 

1227
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:32,770
kind of aware of it being silly and kind
of pretentious.

1228
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:37,150
So I think there was this original idea 
to actually do a cat film festival,

1229
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,793
which happened years ago.
I mean it really did happen that we had 

1230
00:56:41,771 --> 00:56:43,230
anything to do with it.
Well,

1231
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,250
I'll play this if you don't mind.
Okay.

1232
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:47,470
That's a man of it.
Those who have not seen it,

1233
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,020
professor,
this is what,

1234
00:56:49,021 --> 00:56:54,021
2001 or something stupid or no,
2000 of school program.

1235
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,120
We put it up later.
This is tim high.

1236
00:56:57,121 --> 00:57:01,470
Decker's interesting in me is like 
welcomes Tim and Eric.

1237
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,650
You guys already.
It was right there at the very rear.

1238
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:06,943
This,
this is the proposal for the cat fills 

1239
00:57:08,311 --> 00:57:09,144
their subs to when you,
when you see like these little videos 

1240
00:57:10,471 --> 00:57:12,810
like this,
is there kind of a golden city,

1241
00:57:12,811 --> 00:57:14,700
its golden days kind of vibe.

1242
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,533
Do you ever feel like that to mental?
I don't have any sentiment in my heart 

1243
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,740
that no.
That's a good for you.

1244
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:22,790
Like no,
it's cool.

1245
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,850
It's a I fun.
I've fondness for it.

1246
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,160
Film Festival visitable.
You got you.

1247
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:30,990
You get,
yeah.

1248
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:31,823
And this was all eric like look at me.
I really did have that picture of me on 

1249
00:57:35,821 --> 00:57:38,820
the wall with my girlfriend and the 
other side.

1250
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,920
And I was like ironic,
you know,

1251
00:57:40,921 --> 00:57:41,754
it was like silly,
but Eric always tells a story that 

1252
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,700
Zamboni or that picture of the girl,
the ice skating,

1253
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:51,460
he says that that was in there cause 
eric would make um,

1254
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,250
like wedding videos and stuff.
Uh,

1255
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,084
and,
and like film people's recitals for 

1256
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:58,860
money and that,
that shot was in,

1257
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:04,040
it was a mistake when he was a genuine,
that he says it was thick and that I saw

1258
00:58:04,441 --> 00:58:05,460
that and said,
don't,

1259
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:08,340
that's the way claims,
that's the case.

1260
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,210
Now.
I don't know about that.

1261
00:58:10,211 --> 00:58:12,460
He's,
he likes to shower me with,

1262
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,230
well why?
But I thought,

1263
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,083
I know why.
I thought for sure that was a school 

1264
00:58:16,481 --> 00:58:17,314
project.
So that kind of messes up my whole line 

1265
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:20,170
of questioning here.
Five we did another one,

1266
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,660
but we did one that was about lobsters 
and film and being better.

1267
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:26,150
It is,
but it's worth,

1268
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,080
but go ahead.
I mean it's probably applicable.

1269
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:32,280
It's not really,
um,

1270
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,510
let me hear it and not really.
All right,

1271
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,530
well we've got it.
Let's see.

1272
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,840
Uh,
what's the story behind this video?

1273
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:39,350
Check off that one.
Uh,

1274
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:41,070
what kind of grades did you get?
Well,

1275
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,420
a's,
a's always.

1276
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,940
Did your peers enjoy it?
Did they understand it?

1277
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,530
Well,
we did make a video.

1278
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:48,970
You can look it up.
It's called,

1279
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,740
oh,
it's called cat film festival.

1280
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:51,574
No,
it's called lobsters and film would 

1281
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:56,830
probably get you there.
But if we're not seeing that,

1282
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,800
I think that one we made for our senior 
project,

1283
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,680
it was like mid,
mid semester senior project.

1284
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:06,130
Similar and yeah,
it was a little more rough.

1285
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,350
It was a little rougher.
Not quite there yet,

1286
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,830
but that one I'm angered our fellow 
classmate.

1287
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:13,870
Really.
And what and what a fashion.

1288
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,790
Well,
we were kind of dicks about it.

1289
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:20,791
We were given a assignment to make.
So we had a full year of,

1290
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,250
of a film class

1291
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,490
that the culmination was making a film,
making a short film.

1292
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,893
Now they needed a way to grade US 
halfway through to for that first 

1293
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:33,770
semester or whatever.
So they gave this assignment that we had

1294
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:37,690
to do a presentation for the class about
some aspect of filmmaking,

1295
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:38,923
uh,
art direction or editing or 

1296
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:41,324
cinematography.
And Eric and I were just so into the 

1297
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,510
idea of making this film and we thought,
well,

1298
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:49,640
this is what we're here for is to do 
this film.

1299
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,190
By the way,
my films awful.

1300
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:55,550
My real film is awful.
Very serious.

1301
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,370
So embarrassed to show you first joined 
film school,

1302
00:59:58,371 --> 01:00:00,560
you were trying to be a serious 
filmmaker.

1303
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,660
There was this period of like,
comedy wasn't a real thing.

1304
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:07,220
It wasn't seemed unattainable.
Yeah.

1305
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:10,100
And it wasn't something you should just 
always a funny guy.

1306
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:10,910
Be like,
Hey,

1307
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:11,990
I'm a funny guy.
Oh,

1308
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:12,740
he's a funny guy.

1309
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,230
Hilarious guy.
Very fine on what's a yes,

1310
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,870
but I'm,
I'm going to make size area flicks,

1311
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,793
but I'll be,
I'll be like woody allen in the mid 

1312
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,820
seventies you know,
I'll be September.

1313
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,673
What do out terriers.
I loved Woody Allen and that's why I 

1314
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:30,230
kind of,
I mean I think I wanted to go in that,

1315
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:34,610
that sort of direction of making my own 
stuff and being funny in that,

1316
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:36,530
was there a point during college where 
you're like,

1317
01:00:36,531 --> 01:00:40,010
this is kind of all these people and the
people I'm around,

1318
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,290
this isn't what this is isn't connecting
with me.

1319
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,280
Yeah,
a little bit.

1320
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:46,880
I mean at Temple University they were 
very socially,

1321
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,820
uh,
in India they're interested in,

1322
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,450
in sort of political,
social justice,

1323
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:58,250
the kind of storytelling,
filmmaking and comedy was not considered

1324
01:00:58,251 --> 01:01:01,400
something that you could do that with,
which is really stupid.

1325
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:02,923
It's almost like the do that more than 
anything is the perfect breeding ground 

1326
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:07,190
for your style.

1327
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,090
Yeah.
So,

1328
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:11,780
and there were also like technically not
capable of,

1329
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,651
of,
you know,

1330
01:01:12,651 --> 01:01:13,484
they didn't do it.
We hadn't entered into like the final 

1331
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:20,801
cut pro era of where everyone could just
load up a bunch of footage.

1332
01:01:21,381 --> 01:01:25,370
We still were doing like a weird video 
toaster slash cutting film.

1333
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:27,920
So it was,
we're in a weird place where we couldn't

1334
01:01:27,921 --> 01:01:32,900
really make anything that great.
You know how you guys pass?

1335
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:36,470
You got to the finish that story.
It was in the middle of the semester.

1336
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:40,880
Instead of doing a presentation on the 
art direction in front of the students,

1337
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:42,163
uh,
we made this absurd film that was me 

1338
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:46,903
with my presentation was that there are 
lobsters in film and then I could show 

1339
01:01:50,421 --> 01:01:51,254
you examples is adults.
It sounds almost like a conspiracy 

1340
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:53,804
theory.
It was just like a meaningless waste of 

1341
01:01:56,601 --> 01:02:00,470
time and interviewed some professors 
about it.

1342
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,333
And then Eric's was like that vhs is 
better than film and we just made these 

1343
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:08,630
stupid like you,
you know,

1344
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,530
you could look it up.
But,

1345
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:11,510
and then what we thought was really 
clever,

1346
01:02:11,511 --> 01:02:12,344
it was,
we shot the presentation in the same 

1347
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:18,810
lecture hall as where we were.
Everyone else was giving the thing.

1348
01:02:18,811 --> 01:02:20,130
So when we played it in

1349
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,930
the room,
we were in the room,

1350
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,793
it was playing,
we were in the room that it was being 

1351
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,230
played in.
So,

1352
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,533
um,
and then it had this musical interlude 

1353
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:32,390
of us like dancing and it was just like 
very primordial,

1354
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,123
but they were pissed off.
We got an a because the professor had 

1355
01:02:36,471 --> 01:02:41,040
thought it was funny.
The students felt like we,

1356
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,580
they're pissed that we got away with 
really not doing the assignment.

1357
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,633
You know,
they're just angry because they didn't 

1358
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:48,270
think about it and none of them are 
doing anything.

1359
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:53,580
You don't hear their names.
They're not two films a year,

1360
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:59,080
not the thought buddy jokes are 
beginning of making videos.

1361
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:04,341
Kind of started at my school too.
I studied art and video art class.

1362
01:03:04,361 --> 01:03:09,030
Then I ended up doing like our early 
videos and show them in class as,

1363
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:13,680
as like my assignment,
which was also kind of kind of like what

1364
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:14,514
you're describing because in art 
everyone was also very serious and huck 

1365
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:23,340
high emotion and talking in classes and 
I was just never very,

1366
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:26,430
I was never very visually uh,
adept.

1367
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,013
And so you'd take those classes in my,
my go to move would be to like make 

1368
01:03:32,611 --> 01:03:35,520
something intentionally bad,
just to be like,

1369
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:36,510
well,
this is my art,

1370
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,610
you know?
But it's also like,

1371
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,090
I really don't know how to do that 
stuff.

1372
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:42,360
You're shielding yourself in a way of 
like criticism.

1373
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:44,010
Yeah.
But it's,

1374
01:03:44,011 --> 01:03:44,844
funnily enough,
Ila had these video art classes in 

1375
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:49,380
college and I mean,
I was just emulating you guys as much as

1376
01:03:49,381 --> 01:03:51,450
I could because that's all I knew.
That was funny.

1377
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:52,913
And we just made,
like the first one would ne was this 

1378
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:58,920
fetal called chocolate,
where I was like grotesquely naked.

1379
01:03:58,921 --> 01:03:59,754
I mean,
it was wearing underwear and just bring 

1380
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,450
my buying chocolate.
I think we must have just horrified,

1381
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,540
horrified everybody.
Well,

1382
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:07,374
there's a lot of that out.
Certainly in college is a lot of just 

1383
01:04:09,871 --> 01:04:11,760
like,
I'm crazy.

1384
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:12,970
What can I tell you?
Uh,

1385
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,810
my favorite anecdote of Ella's a college
years,

1386
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,840
one of her best friends and credit to 
her for thinking of this idea shirt,

1387
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:24,640
her final video,
we should put a camera on the toilet and

1388
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:28,440
filmed herself taking a poop at that 
professor's comment,

1389
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,530
which,
which sticks with me to this day.

1390
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:34,260
One of the best things I've ever heard 
his note to her was,

1391
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,420
was simply this.
Maybe next time,

1392
01:04:36,421 --> 01:04:37,254
less hair.

1393
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,080
Oh,
that's horrifying.

1394
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,800
So that was what we were up against.
So by,

1395
01:04:45,801 --> 01:04:47,940
by contrast,
I think that it probably wasn't,

1396
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:52,380
that wasn't that discussed right?
I would love to never see that.

1397
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:54,550
Yeah.
Let me ask you again,

1398
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:59,990
did you ever have any director disputes 
during the making of pigment with Tommy?

1399
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,640
Uh,
yeah.

1400
01:05:02,641 --> 01:05:04,260
Um,
that was,

1401
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:07,650
I dunno how much to tell you about that,
but,

1402
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:09,380
um,
well why'd you say that?

1403
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:12,210
Or is there some things that you,
you don't like to talk about it.

1404
01:05:12,211 --> 01:05:13,021
Why is that?
No,

1405
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:13,854
I,
I think there's a little nice to have a 

1406
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:18,190
little mystery,
but I think we

1407
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:23,220
brought him in and um,
and made him the director of that direct

1408
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,083
us and then we,
cause we really wanted to be around him 

1409
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:30,003
to watch how he worked.
That's really why we brought deserve 

1410
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,253
that.
You know,

1411
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,273
you guys were kind of ahead of the game 
and the timing wise up because now he's 

1412
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:42,820
kind of a superstar.
He was last year and now it's,

1413
01:05:42,821 --> 01:05:43,790
I don't know,
it's just,

1414
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:45,650
it's probably,
that's probably it,

1415
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,170
right?
I mean that's not going to,

1416
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,070
yeah.
Yeah.

1417
01:05:48,071 --> 01:05:48,730
I mean,
I dunno.

1418
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:50,140
We were trying to get him on the potty 
and he,

1419
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,600
I mean he keep blew us off twice.
Really?

1420
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:54,130
He lost her number.
Oh,

1421
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,130
well he was a big,
not the most satisfying experience.

1422
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,233
I,
I suspected I suspected that and go how 

1423
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,011
I want it to go.
No,

1424
01:06:03,011 --> 01:06:08,011
I mean there was definitely the was so 
room vibe in La,

1425
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,680
you know,
when we got here back in 2003 so I don't

1426
01:06:14,681 --> 01:06:15,514
feel like we were,
we were in that maybe second wave of 

1427
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:19,450
people that were,
because when we went to the screenings,

1428
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:22,060
it was sold out and,
but all the way back then.

1429
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,060
So yeah,
it was fun.

1430
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:27,220
And then I remember going,
the last time I went,

1431
01:06:27,221 --> 01:06:29,380
which is also several years ago,
it was,

1432
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,380
it had like a,
it took a mean turn.

1433
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:32,243
Maybe it was just the night I was there,
but it just felt like people were 

1434
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:39,220
laughing at that woman who was like,
you know,

1435
01:06:39,221 --> 01:06:41,950
kind of implying that she had gotten fat
and it was just,

1436
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:45,000
it had this kind of nastiness to it in 
the audience.

1437
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,140
It's kind of mob mentality.
That claim was like,

1438
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,720
hm.
I don't know if I liked it.

1439
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,310
Yeah.
I don't know about this,

1440
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,580
but it might've just been the night.
Yeah.

1441
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,230
Tough,
tough audience crowd,

1442
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,570
but did you guys ever kind of,
I mean,

1443
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,840
and the editing bay does well I guess 
you don't want to talk about,

1444
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:02,560
no,
go ahead.

1445
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,393
What about him?
Did he ever give his opinion when you 

1446
01:07:05,801 --> 01:07:06,610
guys putting it together?

1447
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:08,620
Like how did he like the piece after I 
came out,

1448
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,473
you know,
I don't know.

1449
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,860
I didn't talk.
I didn't talk.

1450
01:07:12,861 --> 01:07:14,210
Go about,
uh,

1451
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,580
one of a kind.
Yeah,

1452
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:16,414
he is.
We've met with them several times after 

1453
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:21,580
working with them about doing something 
together and it never,

1454
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,490
it would always get weird and um,
you know,

1455
01:07:24,491 --> 01:07:25,450
we wanted,
he did this thing,

1456
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:26,430
the neighbors,
just,

1457
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,570
you ever see the neighbors?
Yeah,

1458
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,060
that was,
we have one off the wall.

1459
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,071
We were like,
well,

1460
01:07:33,071 --> 01:07:36,370
we'd love to help you produce that.
And he'd be like,

1461
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:38,680
great,
maybe you can get me,

1462
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:43,180
you know,
the right editors and the right people.

1463
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:47,140
Like he wanted to do it for like,
I understand that idea,

1464
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:48,423
but it is about it.
Because what made that so special was 

1465
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,473
we're like,
we will literally just find you the 

1466
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:54,784
money and then you make it and whatever 
it is you'd give it to us and we will 

1467
01:07:58,811 --> 01:08:00,400
hand it to the network.

1468
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,010
Like we don't want to have any,
we want to like,

1469
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:05,830
like uh,
like disturbing a tribe in the Amazon.

1470
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,013
I don't want to have any influence.
I don't want to try to like replicate 

1471
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:10,684
what you do,
but I also don't want to assist you to 

1472
01:08:12,851 --> 01:08:13,684
make it better.
But I also understand his desire to 

1473
01:08:15,201 --> 01:08:16,430
like,
why can't I,

1474
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,770
why can't we just have the best people 
working on this?

1475
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,990
But then it just becomes like anything 
else,

1476
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:22,780
the trig.
So we,

1477
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:25,730
it's just like,
it became too complicated.

1478
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:26,570
Yeah.
I can imagine.

1479
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:27,770
Yeah.
That's kind of his style.

1480
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:32,000
But like working with people like 
Tommy's like their bread and butter of,

1481
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,130
of,
of what you guys did an awesome show.

1482
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:36,080
Yeah.
Do you guys ever,

1483
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:39,200
I mean for all for,
I've heard this while to story.

1484
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:40,520
Tell me if this is something you guys 
did.

1485
01:08:40,521 --> 01:08:41,630
You guys used to do.

1486
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:43,970
Put people through uncomfortable 
situations.

1487
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:47,420
They get a good performer react 
performance for example,

1488
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:51,580
is it true that you will put people on 
cranes up in the sky,

1489
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,590
the green screen,
they get a ride to get?

1490
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:55,341
Well No,
it'd be,

1491
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:56,174
I actually opposite.
I was up in the crane with the actor on 

1492
01:08:59,481 --> 01:09:02,930
green and there's just a couple people 
we do that with,

1493
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:05,580
which is to create a,
uh,

1494
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:06,873
just the Doug [inaudible] who's one of 
the announcers on check it out and he's 

1495
01:09:11,391 --> 01:09:14,300
one of the,
he's like the sports guy and he's a real

1496
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:15,134
straight guys,
a real like serious kind of a normal 

1497
01:09:18,471 --> 01:09:20,300
guy.
But when,

1498
01:09:20,301 --> 01:09:22,520
when we,
we just have the system where when we're

1499
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:25,820
shooting him,
we tried to create just like distraction

1500
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,660
so we can get a moment of him being 
like,

1501
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:29,390
like,
what was that?

1502
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:34,070
And those get harder and harder to do.
The more they get more elaborate.

1503
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:38,030
And just so they culminated in me with 
one of those cranes,

1504
01:09:38,031 --> 01:09:38,864
one of those like [inaudible] where you 
change the light bulb just being like 

1505
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,343
operating where those go.

1506
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:44,063
Yeah.

1507
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:47,813
Yeah.
And we just want to create this chaos 

1508
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:54,210
and,
and an uncomfortable environment that,

1509
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:58,560
that gives just that little spark in 
their eye.

1510
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,150
Like,
I might,

1511
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:04,080
something's gonna fall on me.
Just one that moment.

1512
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,610
Yeah.
Um,

1513
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,240
and we've done that.
We probably took it too far,

1514
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,450
too far.
I'm very intrigued by that.

1515
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:14,160
Uh,
you know,

1516
01:10:14,161 --> 01:10:14,994
we would just like,
there's certain people where we would 

1517
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:17,783
just,
uh,

1518
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:21,420
we'd maybe kinda gotten sick of them and
gotten tired of,

1519
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,433
uh,
they had done something a little bit 

1520
01:10:23,491 --> 01:10:25,050
maybe to deserve it,
but,

1521
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:25,973
um,
we would just like amuse ourselves by 

1522
01:10:28,111 --> 01:10:32,610
like sending in a entree,
like sending an appetizers while we were

1523
01:10:32,611 --> 01:10:34,140
shooting and,
you know,

1524
01:10:34,141 --> 01:10:35,730
yelling at the crew,
like,

1525
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:36,690
get Outta here,
you know?

1526
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:37,823
And they're like,
but he said he was like creating these 

1527
01:10:38,671 --> 01:10:41,970
little plays that really were just for 
us in a year.

1528
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:45,600
Um,
and but nothing ever.

1529
01:10:45,601 --> 01:10:49,650
Um,
nothing ever that we felt like bad about

1530
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,270
it.
It would always end.

1531
01:10:51,271 --> 01:10:55,020
It always ended them feeling good and 
like wanting to work with us again.

1532
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,610
That's the ticket.
I mean,

1533
01:10:56,630 --> 01:11:00,720
you walk a thin line because the people 
that act frequently,

1534
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:05,040
I don't know if they know whether or not
they're right on the joke or not,

1535
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:08,700
but I think the real kicker,
we have kind of the same effect.

1536
01:11:08,701 --> 01:11:10,110
We work with people like that too.
Is it?

1537
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:11,940
They want it,
they want to come back.

1538
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,590
They want to be a part it,
yeah,

1539
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,341
no.
Yeah.

1540
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:15,174
I mean we've had a few people that 
weren't happy with the way things went 

1541
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,250
and we feel bad about that,
you know?

1542
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,200
But,
but for the most part,

1543
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:24,060
uh,
there is,

1544
01:11:24,061 --> 01:11:25,020
first of all,
we're never,

1545
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,390
we're never presenting things,
uh,

1546
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:28,940
w with false pretenses.

1547
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:29,783
We're not saying it's something that,
it isn't always like this is a comedy 

1548
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:33,630
show.
It's,

1549
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,340
uh,
but you know,

1550
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,233
there's certain tricks that we do to get
what you say is a little pr little 

1551
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:41,920
reality out of the situation.
Yeah.

1552
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,340
You know,
I feel is fairly benign,

1553
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:45,174
but,
you know,

1554
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,080
not the most honorable,
honorable way to behave,

1555
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:52,030
which is fine.
You can be a little,

1556
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,940
you can be a level dishonorable 
sometimes.

1557
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:56,520
Um,
how do you find these bizarre people?

1558
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,810
Just craigslist.
People are,

1559
01:11:57,811 --> 01:11:58,860
I mean,
do you have techniques?

1560
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:00,300
What do you,
what do you find these folks?

1561
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,760
Uh,
well we'd like to say,

1562
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:06,600
uh,
there's a couple of services that people

1563
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:10,620
sign up for to become actors and then 
forget that they've,

1564
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,050
you know,
it was like three years ago,

1565
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,193
you go for the old ones,
we'd go over like the bottom of the 

1566
01:12:15,781 --> 01:12:16,240
pile.

1567
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:16,951
Like,
Oh yeah,

1568
01:12:16,951 --> 01:12:19,260
I remember doing that,
but do you want me?

1569
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:22,230
And so some of those people and then 
frankly,

1570
01:12:22,231 --> 01:12:23,064
yeah,
it's,

1571
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:26,520
we built,
sometimes there'll be like an extra that

1572
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:29,430
we,
that ha we'd had like working background

1573
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:30,750
and we'd be like,
who's that?

1574
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:33,390
Right.
Bring him up.

1575
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,100
Um,
yeah,

1576
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:38,280
there was a guy in,
in check it out that we call Brown,

1577
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,203
his name is Brown.
And he was a background guy and he was 

1578
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:46,200
just walking behind rule and he had a 
brown a sweatshirt on.

1579
01:12:46,201 --> 01:12:49,500
It's why we call him brown and we're,
we just saw him and we're like,

1580
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:53,720
that guy,
have him keep walking behind brule.

1581
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:58,800
Just like create a line and just,
and have him look at rural and,

1582
01:12:58,980 --> 01:12:59,813
and we were,
it was one of those things we're just 

1583
01:13:00,601 --> 01:13:01,710
zooming in like,
oh,

1584
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:04,230
that's fucking weird.
And they were like,

1585
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:06,510
you stick around,
we have worked for you.

1586
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,370
Hey,
you're recognizing.

1587
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,200
So kind of special quality.
Yeah.

1588
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:12,420
Just a look.
It's a weird,

1589
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:14,380
weird vibe where,
you know,

1590
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:15,780
yeah,
a little on edge.

1591
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:17,820
Um,
that's usually it.

1592
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:21,150
It's,
we get plenty of people sent,

1593
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,620
you know,
who are like,

1594
01:13:22,621 --> 01:13:24,450
you know,
their headshots or wearing a bow tie and

1595
01:13:24,451 --> 01:13:25,800
they've got glasses and then they're 
like,

1596
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,600
you know,
I'm the wacky guy.

1597
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:32,120
And like it's a special thing.
Usually it's like a normal person that,

1598
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:36,150
that feels like they don't belong in 
this,

1599
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:37,223
in this world.
Have you ever had had a bad reaction 

1600
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:40,830
with some of these people because they 
are a little lacking.

1601
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:44,400
Some of them are little and seem like a 
little wackier than others.

1602
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:45,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

1603
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:47,070
Well,
I mean,

1604
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,770
whacked by a Wacky,
I dunno what that,

1605
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:52,740
uh,
there's people that you're like,

1606
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:53,460
yeah,
like,

1607
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:53,881
Ooh,
this,

1608
01:13:53,881 --> 01:13:54,714
I don't want to keep this guy.
I'm going to not give them my cell 

1609
01:13:56,071 --> 01:13:56,904
phone.
We're not going to hang out after the 

1610
01:13:58,681 --> 01:14:00,190
shoot.
Um,

1611
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:04,200
but yeah,
I mean it's usually pretty good vibes.

1612
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:08,200
Everybody you've ever heard of this,
uh,

1613
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:09,283
this phenomenon,
I always hear this now it's like you 

1614
01:14:10,771 --> 01:14:11,311
hear people,
it,

1615
01:14:11,311 --> 01:14:12,040
it's like a tim and

1616
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,600
Eric Sketch,
you know?

1617
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,730
Yeah.
Have you heard of the subreddit?

1618
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,350
It's called.
I'm not knocking him.

1619
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,560
And what do you think about that?
I love that place.

1620
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:20,070
Cool.
Yeah.

1621
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:23,320
I don't go there often,
but sometimes I see stuff there and it's

1622
01:14:23,321 --> 01:14:23,710
like,
yeah,

1623
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:24,800
that's,
I mean it's,

1624
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,090
that's where are a lot of our stuff 
comes from.

1625
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:29,820
We don't look there,
but we under,

1626
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:33,490
that's the world that we would look at 
and I've got one video.

1627
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:34,324
Cool is my favorite.
That actually was one of our first big 

1628
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:40,630
videos was making an edit this video,
I don't know if you've seen this,

1629
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,520
have you seen this?
I don't think so.

1630
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:44,380
I think you'll love it.
This guy's such a leg,

1631
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:46,570
30 seconds.
I mean it's so powerful.

1632
01:14:46,571 --> 01:14:51,571
I'm telling you this is cool.
So while this guy just,

1633
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:54,730
he just kept it cause it's such an old 
video,

1634
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,710
but it's just the guy from a documentary
a,

1635
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,390
he's a ice cream taste tester by 
professional

1636
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,540
gold.
He's think I have seen,

1637
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:08,190
this is what we do is take a small 
amount of right off the top.

1638
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,490
It doesn't take much.
That's the warmest part right here.

1639
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:16,580
I'm going to invert the spoon,
hold 9,000

1640
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:18,623
tastes,
but doug would just loop that part 

1641
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:28,120
having pure vanilla or sweeteners,
that's a 10

1642
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:36,223
so actually you know what I want to do,
if I can just indulge myself so I get 

1643
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:40,334
here for Christ's sake.
The first big video we made was it edit 

1644
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:48,240
kind of a Doug Dj dug a little remix.
Yeah.

1645
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,140
Just show you a picture I just sent to 
vic.

1646
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:56,570
That is like a pretty good example of 
how we work in real time.

1647
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:58,443
Mm hmm.
12 million views on this sick little 

1648
01:16:00,551 --> 01:16:02,690
baby man.
That's crazy.

1649
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:10,010
Oh that was when w I'm ready.
Are you ready to watch this?

1650
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,750
I'll look at the picture.
Oh that's very quick.

1651
01:16:11,751 --> 01:16:13,340
And maybe you can show your crowd,
but yeah,

1652
01:16:13,341 --> 01:16:14,174
we can show them.
I just was watching a little bit of the 

1653
01:16:15,921 --> 01:16:16,754
John Mccain funeral the other day,
like the procession and you know it was 

1654
01:16:20,811 --> 01:16:21,644
just on the news and they just,
you see this guy off to the side and 

1655
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,970
it's the kind of thing I just capture 
and send to.

1656
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:30,850
Who is that guy?
Matt?

1657
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,060
Matt,
can you see that?

1658
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:33,940
Let's get,
let's find out who is.

1659
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:36,980
This is a,
it's probably somebody well known.

1660
01:16:36,981 --> 01:16:39,620
He's standing right by the car.
Buy The car,

1661
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,480
look at this guy.
But like that's a great special call.

1662
01:16:43,481 --> 01:16:46,100
It's like the world is full of the Tim 
and Eric.

1663
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,150
It's all around us.
You are,

1664
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,490
but you guys,
you're,

1665
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,040
you named it,
right?

1666
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,070
You like put a name to this strange?
I guess so.

1667
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:58,130
No.
So here,

1668
01:16:58,131 --> 01:17:01,370
this is my,
this was my big break.

1669
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:03,020
Okay.
This is 27 seconds.

1670
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,020
It's quick.
Quicker than the original.

1671
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:07,243
Yeah.

1672
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:13,420
Cover all thousand taste bud area 
warming up,

1673
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:17,330
driving up,
talking to him.

1674
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,840
That cream pure vanilla.
Yup.

1675
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:24,973
That's a 10

1676
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:35,640
that I mean for for 11 that's 11 million
views.

1677
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:37,280
While 12,
if,

1678
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,580
do you know if you want to round did jay
well,

1679
01:17:41,581 --> 01:17:42,790
good for you.
That was my,

1680
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:43,643
Nathan was learning how to edit.
Like that was the first video I edited 

1681
01:17:46,951 --> 01:17:49,530
possibly by myself and then come on.
Hey,

1682
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:51,090
well good for you.
I mean it's great.

1683
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:55,560
Thank you.
You've found something original and um,

1684
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:56,993
you know,
you found the rhythm of that that made 

1685
01:17:58,231 --> 01:17:59,730
you laugh and you,
thank you.

1686
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:03,480
You sure?
Now we see the original,

1687
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:06,880
we almost do that editing,
right?

1688
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,310
Yeah,
that's right.

1689
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:10,560
It was so simple.
What's going on?

1690
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:13,620
Why's Papa John's so funny because we've
also been John's,

1691
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:17,400
I became fascinated by papa John and 
then almost separately.

1692
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,770
I didn't realize that you guys were 
doing pop that on gags.

1693
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,190
We did it lie papa John.
I,

1694
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:25,350
yeah,
I don't remember.

1695
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:28,280
It's just so benign and lame and,
well,

1696
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:29,850
what year company Papa?

1697
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:32,130
Kind of funny.
Just right out the gate.

1698
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,930
I can't remember what our,
well,

1699
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,390
we started doing live shows,
sort of.

1700
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:38,400
Um,
not,

1701
01:18:38,401 --> 01:18:40,350
we didn't naturally come out of doing 
live.

1702
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:42,100
You're not like standups.
Uh,

1703
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,230
so we were like,
oh,

1704
01:18:43,231 --> 01:18:45,340
we've got to do a live show,
you know,

1705
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,560
where are we going to do,
you know,

1706
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:50,880
and one of that was one of the ideas was
that we'd sort of like throw a pizza out

1707
01:18:50,881 --> 01:18:54,360
in the field.
This is basically what gallagher used to

1708
01:18:54,361 --> 01:18:54,960
do.
You know,

1709
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,780
isn't that complicated?
But yeah,

1710
01:18:56,781 --> 01:18:57,800
I don't remember.
It was just like the,

1711
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:00,330
the world of the khaki pants and the 
bad,

1712
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:05,580
I mean it comes out of that,
which we did with the Shrek videos too,

1713
01:19:05,581 --> 01:19:08,270
which is like a blatant,
uh,

1714
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:13,640
like self promotion for somebody else.
Just sort of like proud of companies.

1715
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:17,830
This is a corporate kind of like no,
uh,

1716
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:22,920
no shame kind of vibe that we'd see in,
in life.

1717
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:25,740
You know,
at like a super bowl or something.

1718
01:19:25,741 --> 01:19:27,720
Like Papa John's presents,
you know,

1719
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:28,554
Whitney Houston,
the whole stadium after Papa Papa is no 

1720
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:34,380
longer in the house.
I've been hearing about it.

1721
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:38,580
They C oh is called Steven Steven pop.
Steven.

1722
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:40,120
No Papa Steve.
Not Love.

1723
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:42,660
Why always think like,
why can't,

1724
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:45,630
why do companies have to keep existing 
forever?

1725
01:19:45,631 --> 01:19:47,310
Like camp,
things just end.

1726
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:52,720
Can't they just tell it all it all off 
now they've all doe way.

1727
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:55,860
He tried giving away a pizza and empire.
These things don't mean think,

1728
01:19:55,861 --> 01:19:57,570
think companies come and go.
Right.

1729
01:19:57,810 --> 01:19:58,643
I'll pop it.
He was built to last I think sauces or 

1730
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,030
butter sauce.
Yeah.

1731
01:20:04,031 --> 01:20:06,270
That's pretty good skill.
It's ridiculous.

1732
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:08,370
Also,

1733
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,670
I've got a couple more,
I mean we're,

1734
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:10,504
we're pretty much done here,
but I've got some videos that I'd love 

1735
01:20:14,221 --> 01:20:15,810
to show you if you got some time.
Okay.

1736
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,990
They my videos now.
Oh,

1737
01:20:17,991 --> 01:20:19,350
okay.
Well Alex Jones,

1738
01:20:19,351 --> 01:20:21,540
I've seen you goofing on him.
You have a great impression.

1739
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:24,020
Yep.
It takes me a little bit to get into it.

1740
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,760
Yeah.
Happy to be here.

1741
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:30,400
He's also been,
um,

1742
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:34,030
in a little bit of a goofball.
He got band a little bit of a Goof,

1743
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,310
but then I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you why they're doing it.

1744
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:40,790
Because the powers that we have,
the influence that we have,

1745
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,170
the ability to reach the people out 
there scares,

1746
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,710
scares them too.
Yeah.

1747
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,050
That is too good.

1748
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:49,400
Well,
here I've got a little soundbite here.

1749
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:52,900
Destroy the child.
That's my little soundboard.

1750
01:20:52,901 --> 01:20:53,540
It,
uh,

1751
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,630
in fact he got banned.
But then the,

1752
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:56,510
I mean that,
you know,

1753
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:58,190
that was a thing that happened.
But then,

1754
01:20:58,590 --> 01:20:59,423
and first of all,
let me just preface this because I 

1755
01:21:01,131 --> 01:21:01,964
don't,
there's nothing wrong with being trans 

1756
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:06,080
and that's not the point of what I'm 
about to tell you.

1757
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:07,063
Transient or,
or transgender close to them are 

1758
01:21:08,811 --> 01:21:09,644
perfectly acceptable.
But he is someone who has said that 

1759
01:21:12,051 --> 01:21:15,020
being a transgender person is a mental 
illness.

1760
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:16,093
And have you seen in the news that he 
was actually found to be a jerk in his 

1761
01:21:20,061 --> 01:21:22,600
toolbox to transport?
Oh,

1762
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,180
oh,
I didn't know.

1763
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,450
No,
let me thank you.

1764
01:21:26,451 --> 01:21:27,350
The of this chick,
well,

1765
01:21:27,351 --> 01:21:28,850
he's kind of,
I want to say,

1766
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:32,540
I don't want to say ruins,
but I feel like being banned,

1767
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:34,010
he had this huge thing.

1768
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:35,870
He was banned off everywhere and 
everyone was like,

1769
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:36,933
it was this great social issue where 
like freedom of speech and he was like 

1770
01:21:39,531 --> 01:21:42,170
riding that.
But like a couple of days later,

1771
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:45,050
I think he's a meme.
I think he's a meme now.

1772
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:48,290
Well,
he's been to meet people.

1773
01:21:48,291 --> 01:21:51,530
There's people that support him.
But I feel like he's been turned off the

1774
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:53,360
video before you,
have you seen the video where the,

1775
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:54,553
the fan of his Milo and him or sitting 
at a diner and this fan comes up to him 

1776
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,333
and he's,
the guy looks like he's on meth like 

1777
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,293
this.
Tweaker you're like living in a trailer 

1778
01:22:07,611 --> 01:22:08,444
somewhere and like he just looks like 
he's got that thing in his eye that he 

1779
01:22:11,121 --> 01:22:14,390
believes everything Alex Jones says.
And he's like,

1780
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:16,280
uh,
you know,

1781
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:18,350
I've been following you for years.
And he's all like,

1782
01:22:18,351 --> 01:22:19,440
yeah.
And I was,

1783
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:21,960
you could see Alex Jones just like 
cringy.

1784
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:22,933
Oh,
I haven't,

1785
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:27,150
yeah,
I've got some,

1786
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:30,050
I got some time to send you.
I've got this footage you need.

1787
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:34,290
And you could see them like getting up 
and leaving and you're like family.

1788
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:37,510
No,
but Alex Jones is going to be haunted by

1789
01:22:37,511 --> 01:22:41,590
these people and it's nice to get a dose
of like,

1790
01:22:41,591 --> 01:22:42,520
Hey,
these are your people.

1791
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:44,640
People suck.
Well,

1792
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:46,960
so Alex Jones,
by the way,

1793
01:22:46,961 --> 01:22:49,150
he's selling beauty products called Info
wars.

1794
01:22:49,151 --> 01:22:49,984
Yes.
For Women.

1795
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:51,183
Well,
it's for skincare for men because I 

1796
01:22:52,411 --> 01:22:53,730
mean,
he is an Alpha male.

1797
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:58,510
He's very alpha as as it gets.
He's so alpha that when he watches porn,

1798
01:22:58,511 --> 01:23:00,100
even the chicks dicks.
Wow.

1799
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:03,680
Let me see this.
So how do we not a joke.

1800
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:07,660
This is real.
This is real is a heart attack.

1801
01:23:07,661 --> 01:23:09,790
And this is fresh news.
This is today.

1802
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,870
It's a cup from him I bought a week ago.
Yeah.

1803
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,310
Well I mean,
I mean you know twitter.

1804
01:23:16,311 --> 01:23:20,860
So who knows?
I wouldn't know.

1805
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,200
Yeah,
no,

1806
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,790
as far as I'm aware that hasn't happened
but close.

1807
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,200
Okay.
Let's see.

1808
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,360
Let's do this in mind

1809
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,480
products.
But these are so good.

1810
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,220
Great skin cream.
Aloe Vera.

1811
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:39,750
There's no spatial.com.
So here we go.

1812
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:43,550
Here's the moment you can stop,

1813
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,510
right?
So,

1814
01:23:46,511 --> 01:23:47,630
uh,
hey baby.

1815
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:51,020
Okay.
Now obviously it was a brief encounter.

1816
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:54,590
Now what was it that we saw?
Dan,

1817
01:23:54,591 --> 01:23:55,424
can you tell me what was the title?
Cause I don't want to pull up and show 

1818
01:23:56,601 --> 01:23:57,560
anything.
I'm not supposed to see.

1819
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:59,050
It was something of like,
um,

1820
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:00,950
Dan,
tell me what was the exact title,

1821
01:24:00,951 --> 01:24:01,784
if you could play,
you need to hear because it's really 

1822
01:24:04,221 --> 01:24:07,370
true cause it was um,
insatiable cock.

1823
01:24:07,371 --> 01:24:09,410
Hunger is a,
and I need a,

1824
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,690
I need a direct,
let me,

1825
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:14,000
let me Google it real quick man.
He's like,

1826
01:24:14,001 --> 01:24:17,060
he's got some,
some uh,

1827
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:20,390
you know,
he used to be satisfied somehow.

1828
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:22,390
Self satisfaction.
Well,

1829
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,470
I mean watching pornography is fine,
but yeah,

1830
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:25,371
no,
I understand.

1831
01:24:25,371 --> 01:24:28,580
You can't be,
you're watching people are mentally sick

1832
01:24:28,581 --> 01:24:31,370
and then beaten your fucking dirty ass.
Alex Jones.

1833
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:32,620
Me.
No,

1834
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:33,950
that's good.
That's good.

1835
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:36,950
Okay.
That's so funny that now we can just see

1836
01:24:36,951 --> 01:24:39,980
everything I'm doing and my can't 
opening windows.

1837
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,990
Who and who knows what's what people saw
on my phone.

1838
01:24:41,991 --> 01:24:43,620
You gave me that phone.
I will.

1839
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:45,343
Yeah,
I showed him the naughty Tba Marissa 

1840
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:53,690
minx relieved of cock hunger by Stud.
So that's,

1841
01:24:53,691 --> 01:24:56,960
that's what it said on the screen real 
briefly is that uh,

1842
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:57,973
trends,
well naughty t girl to girl relieved of 

1843
01:25:00,831 --> 01:25:01,664
cock hunger.
So confusing is a clear like found the 

1844
01:25:08,931 --> 01:25:11,160
video.
They saw the title Naughty Tieger.

1845
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:13,340
Okay.
And people found that video and it was a

1846
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:14,930
very graphic,
I was doing research,

1847
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:19,250
I was finding out what's going on in 
nursing world.

1848
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:25,030
Well actually we don't even need to 
imagine he is the reaction because we've

1849
01:25:25,431 --> 01:25:26,264
got it.
Good

1850
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:32,060
development upset about this thing.
Look a little like Wilson,

1851
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,210
that cut guy,
you know the wheel Sasso from Fox.

1852
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:41,170
I mean from mad tv yet it'll come.
You could look up.

1853
01:25:41,171 --> 01:25:43,190
We'll come and get us to,
well let's look up for,

1854
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:47,200
and don't realize it until just now,
but well Sasso done that right?

1855
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:50,830
We've got another SNA.
Oh yeah,

1856
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,740
it does look like they're on.
Um,

1857
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,850
what was that name of that Vm at TV.
So,

1858
01:25:58,380 --> 01:25:59,213
so here we go.
So caller asked him going to get and 

1859
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:06,560
everyone on the Internet was just 
talking about how he was caught watching

1860
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:09,020
porn.
I'm going to address something.

1861
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:10,723
Here we go.

1862
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:11,930
Okay.
That was neck and neck.

1863
01:26:11,931 --> 01:26:13,760
So people don't get upset about this.
They can win.

1864
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:15,700
Yeah.

1865
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:16,620
Um,
and also,

1866
01:26:16,621 --> 01:26:18,470
um,
what about the Trans Porn on your phone?

1867
01:26:18,471 --> 01:26:19,880
Out of her,
you were going to talk about that?

1868
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:25,190
Say that again.
Sorry.

1869
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:29,690
Articles about that.
It's ridiculous.

1870
01:26:29,691 --> 01:26:30,524
I was like looking up,
some reporter popped up porn on my 

1871
01:26:34,941 --> 01:26:35,960
phone,
everybody's had porn,

1872
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:40,970
popular phones hundreds of times in the 
studio.

1873
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,670
And then like something pops up like,
oh my God,

1874
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:47,923
I looked at,
it wasn't the news blurted out cause 

1875
01:26:49,311 --> 01:26:50,144
there was nothing there.
They blurt it to then say something was 

1876
01:26:51,891 --> 01:26:52,800
there,
he went to it.

1877
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:53,703
But some porn menu,
I probably had porn men use pop up 500 

1878
01:26:56,301 --> 01:26:57,134
times in the line.

1879
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:57,983
By the way,
I've seen it was a four chan detective 

1880
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,400
kind of live and die by the pepe the 
frog.

1881
01:27:05,401 --> 01:27:06,234
Right.
And so I've seen the detective work and 

1882
01:27:08,161 --> 01:27:08,994
there is no doubt that this guy was 
looking to relieve his insatiable 

1883
01:27:12,391 --> 01:27:13,224
coffee.
Determined it wasn't some pop up and it 

1884
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:17,230
was most definitely,
yeah,

1885
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:20,460
I've seen it.
I've seen the detective work.

1886
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,210
Okay.
There's insatiable hunger.

1887
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:23,570
China gets to something,
right?

1888
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:27,530
That's the end.
It's the nihilism that that if they live

1889
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:28,383
to eat just as much pleasure,
it's just about getting whoever's no 

1890
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:37,530
law,
no alliances or ounces for you guys.

1891
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,420
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

1892
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:42,690
No,
I'm the fortune freaks.

1893
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,081
Yeah,
no,

1894
01:27:43,081 --> 01:27:45,560
they got one.
They your own.

1895
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:46,463
Yeah,
but I'll finish it cause he's squirming 

1896
01:27:49,261 --> 01:27:50,540
and it's really fun.
The one who loves,

1897
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:54,580
I appreciate your call.
I mean it's insane.

1898
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:58,180
People,
people that look at porn and people that

1899
01:27:58,181 --> 01:28:01,810
lie about it.
I wasn't looking at porn on my phone.

1900
01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:06,110
There's people who watch porn are people
who lie about it and I wasn't.

1901
01:28:06,111 --> 01:28:06,944
Looking at a bar is a great little piece
of Alex Jones and we do it on my call 

1902
01:28:13,941 --> 01:28:15,030
and show called.
It's a,

1903
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:16,100
by the way,
that's the other thing.

1904
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:17,800
Want to plug office hours,
office hours.

1905
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,890
It's my little podcast Collin's show.
What's the funnel page?

1906
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:23,270
A real tim.
Hi Decker.

1907
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:24,980
But you're telling me I should do it 
here on Youtube,

1908
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,590
I believe.
I truly believe you can subscribe to the

1909
01:28:27,591 --> 01:28:30,320
podcast usual podcast ways.
Yeah,

1910
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:31,333
but he's got a great one.
I use the sample of the time it seemed 

1911
01:28:32,701 --> 01:28:32,860
good

1912
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:33,960
or or or or

1913
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:39,580
that is that edit or was he really just 
trying to get a stop?

1914
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:44,670
He did a few like or times dick really 
gets Alex.

1915
01:28:47,631 --> 01:28:48,760
Man,
you good?

1916
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:49,410
I don't

1917
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:54,410
take phones on here that I look at porn 
on of porn on exclusively in the shower.

1918
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,830
They have a Ziploc bag.
Weird.

1919
01:29:01,831 --> 01:29:06,610
Non Camera's already going.
Like he used to be that bad,

1920
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:07,503
like androids.
It's so great and it reminds me so much 

1921
01:29:11,551 --> 01:29:13,320
of the tech crews,
you know?

1922
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:14,750
I thought he was going to say it was an 
end in

1923
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:15,920
Turner,
so yeah,

1924
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,650
he didn't even know.
Didn't even go that far.

1925
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,840
Right.
Everyone can watch whatever they want,

1926
01:29:20,841 --> 01:29:23,000
but don't think about it and,
right,

1927
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:26,150
exactly.
Exactly.

1928
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:28,610
Well that's about,
I mean we're going to end on that note.

1929
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,193
Yeah.
Is there anything else that we should 

1930
01:29:30,981 --> 01:29:32,240
discuss?
No,

1931
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:34,670
I think it's been lively.
Lovely chat.

1932
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,090
Thank you.
Well,

1933
01:29:36,091 --> 01:29:38,240
I enjoyed it.
First of all,

1934
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:39,560

1935

1936

No pizza's going to be thrown out at 

1937
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:50,300
that show.
Bring your own pizza.

1938
01:29:50,330 --> 01:29:51,080
Oh No.
Yeah,

1939
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:55,190
the on cinema show.
You're going to get a some dkr also.

1940
01:29:55,191 --> 01:29:58,510
I'm doing the adult swim festival.
I should be booked that.

1941
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,680
I think that'll be fun.
You want to go there with Justin,

1942
01:30:01,681 --> 01:30:02,091
right?
Yeah,

1943
01:30:02,091 --> 01:30:03,020
yeah.
Um,

1944
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:04,640
and then,
uh,

1945
01:30:04,641 --> 01:30:09,260
office hours when I have the time and 
see me in Jordan peals new movie,

1946
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,590
March,
2009.

1947
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:15,620
Well that's not [inaudible] release 
already.

1948
01:30:15,621 --> 01:30:16,454
And that is where you get on it.
You're still filming or just you're not 

1949
01:30:18,951 --> 01:30:19,730
even start?
No,

1950
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:21,110
we're in the middle.
In the middle.

1951
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,750
Is that the real time consuming?
Uh,

1952
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:25,220
for him?
It is not for you.

1953
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:25,760
Uh,
no.

1954
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,593
I'm,
I'm kind of in and out throughout the 

1955
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:29,690
next few months.
It's,

1956
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:31,090
it's,
it's lovely though,

1957
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,230
just when you w w when you,
uh,

1958
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:37,550
can do something where you're not 
responsible for that element of it,

1959
01:30:37,551 --> 01:30:40,820
which is unusual for us to just kind of 
be happy,

1960
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,140
you know,
not worry about,

1961
01:30:42,141 --> 01:30:44,150
oh,
we're running a little late here.

1962
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,313
How are we going to get this?
You don't have to worry about any of 

1963
01:30:46,461 --> 01:30:47,720
that.
You just show up.

1964
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:49,220
Just show up,
do your best.

1965
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:50,823
Uh,
say God bless you said a lot of 

1966
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:56,450
memorizing lines and some,
but not much.

1967
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:57,590
And it's very,
you know,

1968
01:30:57,591 --> 01:30:59,890
he's not super specific,
you know,

1969
01:30:59,891 --> 01:31:00,830
it's like say what?

1970
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:01,693
Say what?
How you would say that's good because 

1971
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:04,624
I'm,
that's the one thing I'm not good at is 

1972
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,930
memorizing lines.
I'm afraid I could never do that.

1973
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,060
I think it's a discipline.
Right?

1974
01:31:11,061 --> 01:31:14,390
And it's to get better at it.
It's like you can train your brain to do

1975
01:31:14,391 --> 01:31:16,280
that better,
but I'm not,

1976
01:31:16,281 --> 01:31:18,770
I'm still very,
very like,

1977
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:19,940
what do I see?
Oh,

1978
01:31:19,941 --> 01:31:23,630
it was in a better call Saul,
the last episode there was a,

1979
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:24,943
that gail character.
Do you watch the show caught up except 

1980
01:31:27,441 --> 01:31:28,141
for the new APP?
Oh,

1981
01:31:28,141 --> 01:31:28,974
well,
you know gail characters from breaking 

1982
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:33,350
bad.
That's the guy that business is now.

1983
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:34,543
Yeah.
Well he does this thing where he's like 

1984
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,280
singing all these,
these,

1985
01:31:37,281 --> 01:31:38,114
uh,
chemical compounds to a walkman 

1986
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:44,780
millennium and he's doing it like 
perfectly.

1987
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:48,050
And I'm watching that going like,
I would never be able to do that pretty,

1988
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:48,913
it would be like,
it would be like a week of shooting and 

1989
01:31:50,831 --> 01:31:53,900
like you could edit something together 
and it was such a short scene,

1990
01:31:53,901 --> 01:31:56,780
like the dedication and rehearsing just 
for that brief.

1991
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,040
And I bet you nobody thinks about that.

1992
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:01,653
But yeah,
I did have this sinking feeling like I 

1993
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:08,770
would never be able to do that.
And what else can't I do?

1994
01:32:08,771 --> 01:32:11,150
What if I get something like that?
Oh,

1995
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:16,450
you said you're a big ass while I'm Tim.
I appreciate you so much.

1996
01:32:17,621 --> 01:32:20,230
Coming out of,
I mean we're a needless to say,

1997
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:21,910
but I'll say it again.
Huge,

1998
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:25,060
huge fans and I'm very grateful for 
everything you do and I'm glad this was,

1999
01:32:25,061 --> 01:32:26,950
I think this was a positive experience 
for you.

2000
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:29,620
It was very good.
I feel I'm old.

2001
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,053
I was there.
There you go.

2002
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:32,200
Oh,
it was lovely.

2003
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:34,130
Good time.
Coffee.

2004
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,180
Yeah.
I'll never watch it or listen to it.

2005
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:38,470
No,
I won't even go to mean.

2006
01:32:38,471 --> 01:32:41,740
Like I said,
I hope I didn't hurt anybody's feelings.

2007
01:32:41,741 --> 01:32:43,900
I hope I didn't reveal too much.
I didn't ruin,

2008
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:48,250
I won't read the Common Vic.
Maybe he's watched me feel good to make.

2009
01:32:48,251 --> 01:32:49,084
Are you out there?

2010
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:52,090
You're great.
Thank you.

2011
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:53,260
With one of these,

2012
