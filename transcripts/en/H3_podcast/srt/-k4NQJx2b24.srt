1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,333
Everybody to the h three podcasts,
we were formally known as the h three 

2
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:11,104
experience,
but I have to say after meditating this 

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,463
weekend,
I believe we are now the age three 

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,180
transsexual.

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,360
Welcome to the correct opinion.

6
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,623
This is the Tuesday episode where we 
talk about current events and basically 

7
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:37,360
everything you're going to hear here is 
the correct opinion.

8
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,720
You need another one of those.
This is no longer an experience.

9
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:45,340
My friend did it work then.
Now I guess we missed to hit it one more

10
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:49,600
time.
Let's turn it off that weekend guys.

11
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:54,430
Today's episode is sponsored by honey 
and I want to plead you all guys,

00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:17,944

Excited about that?
So don't miss that.

23
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,820
Or we were on.
Um,

24
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,230
yeah,
last night.

25
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,910
Yeah,
we were on killed.

26
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:37,990
Tony killed.
Tony is the number one they love saying.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,113
Yeah,
that's true.

28
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,290
Number one,
live podcast,

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,623
light world,
but it's alive in front of a live 

30
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,520
audience and they do it every Monday 
night at the comedy store.

31
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,840
They tour a lot too,
but they were gracious enough to have us

32
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:54,910
on the show and it was a blast.
So those guys are awesome.

33
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:58,480
I can't wait to have them in here.
Life Kill Tony.

34
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,370
Check it out.
We were on their,

35
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,320
their,
their show,

36
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:04,480
but obviously don't click away because 
we're just getting started.

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,230
I'm most importantly,
we need to talk about Papa John.

38
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,130
Yeah,
let's let us by.

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,300
John is having a meltdown.
Papa John's spent a little too much time

40
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,850
on the pizza.

41
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,890
I'm saying I liked my pizza a little 
overcooked,

42
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:28,900
but this pizza is.
This pizza's a little too overcooked.

43
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,801
Yeah,
yeah.

44
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,900
No,
I'm check this out.

45
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,690
So Papa John,
as you guys all know,

46
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:35,381
they're late.
Great.

47
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:37,930
Papa John,
who was outed from Papa John,

48
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,220
there's a whole,
there's like a whole kind of paradoxical

49
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:43,054
situation going on with Papa Johns.
Papa John is trying to kick Papa John 

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,313
Out,
but how can papa John Be Papa John 

51
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,013
Without Papa John?
So Papa John the company is trying to 

52
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:56,770
kick out Papa John the person the 
Shatner,

53
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,933
but they are proper.
John just change your name at that 

54
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,470
point.
Your Papa John Pizza.

55
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,304
You can't separate the pizza from the 
man so they're trying to distance 

56
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:10,980
themselves from here as much as possible
like his face is all over.

57
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,640
So they removed his face from the 
branding that was white.

58
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,120
That's what was the final Straw for papa
himself.

59
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,450
He's like,
you cannot take my face off that Pi box.

60
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,373
No,
because basically my face looks like a 

61
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:23,644
pizza pie.
I've spent so much time near a pizza 

62
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:25,924
oven and it's basically a preview of 
what's going to be like when you open 

63
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:31,330
it,
but they're saying we can't be dependent

64
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:34,390
on one person,
especially this person.

65
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,910
So he made.
This is.

66
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,150
I love this story.
This is just so he made a website,

67
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,300
papa himself called.
Hey Papa John Dot com.

68
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,650
I am Papa John like a Spartagen 
[inaudible].

69
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,090
You know that although I am Papa John,
he,

70
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,133
he acts like it's a social movement 
where like everyone fucking cares so 

71
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:57,700
much about Papa John.
I am Papa John.

72
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:58,970
We,
you,

73
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,180
you shall not silence us.
We are,

74
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,170
we are,
we are pizza.

75
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,063
So let me read you some of the excerpts.
You know how long the actual their 

76
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:10,534
website.
When you order a pizza you can choose 

77
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:13,930
the toppings and then in like phones,
like always.

78
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,140
Oh yeah,
I know finance.

79
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,103
Who is here still on this website?
You can still order a pizza from Papa 

80
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,580
John's dot com.
I'm here.

81
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:25,570
You guys.
Let me read.

82
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,490
This is the,
the his homepage.

83
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:30,880
So let me read it.
An excerpt here for,

84
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,743
for you all here.
I built Papa John's from the ground up 

85
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,770
and remain its largest shareholder.
I love my company,

86
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,200
its employees,
its franchisees.

87
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Customers don't love you anymore.
The board wants to silence me.

88
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,100
This is my website and my way to talk to
you.

89
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,190
Save Papa John's dot com.
As I said in a recent letter,

90
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,770
I miss you all very much.
How the fuck you get claimed them?

91
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,790
You're just.
You're a pizza CEO.

92
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,600
I missed you guys all you fat,
butter,

93
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:16,600
loving sauced,
gluttonous.

94
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:17,434
Sons of bitches I love.
Sometimes I'm at home and I imagined 

95
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:23,680
suck in the butter garlic sauce off your
fingers.

96
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,660
I miss it that much.
I miss you very much more than words can

97
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:31,114
express sometime that day though more 
than words can express sometimes garlic 

98
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:43,330
sauce because sometimes I rub garlic,
salt,

99
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,020
peanuts and use it as a lubricant.
It reminds me of how much I love you.

100
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,873
Better Times.

101
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,790
Papa John's is our life's work and we 
will all get this together somehow.

102
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,103
Some way.
I can only imagine how difficult this 

103
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,370
entire situation is on.
You know,

104
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,800
he goes from I to we,
I feel it.

105
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,670
Papa John's and then he's like,
is our life's work?

106
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,923
We will all get through this imagined 
papa John's saying to just some fucking 

107
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,624
guy,
the orders pizza from there at once a 

108
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,424
week.
I can only imagine how difficult this 

109
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,560
entire situation is on you.
I feel like you run this to you,

110
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,020
right?
I think he wrote it to himself.

111
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,570
I'm very sorry that you all have to go 
through this.

112
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,320
Just know that

113
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,960
I still finger my wife with butter.
Garlic sauce though is listening.

114
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:53,820
Ethan and Beau don't even get me started
about that.

115
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:54,654
Kid Ain't right.
I can only imagine how hard this has 

116
00:06:57,811 --> 00:07:01,170
been on boat.
We pack his lunch with butter,

117
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:05,210
garlic sauce every day,
and this,

118
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,123
this part is real.
Know that in every minute of every day 

119
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,930
you're in my thoughts and my prayers.
Who exactly drama queen included in this

120
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:19,350
website or links to recent press 
releases,

121
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,250
news articles and recipes to my world.
Famous garlic sauce,

122
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,383
which also doubles as a really good sex 
lubricant to remind you of the better 

123
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:32,660
times.
Signed.

124
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,210
Sincerely,
pop up.

125
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,171
Butter,
garlic,

126
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:39,950
salt shatner.
Oh,

127
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:42,800
he also wrote,
we are getting the truth out there.

128
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,310
Garlic,
my bar,

129
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,960
my butter garlic sauce was invented as I
tried to make my own sex lubricant.

130
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,410
My wife tasted it accidentally and said,
hey,

131
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:00,130
pretty good.
That was emotional.

132
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,400
Beautiful Journey.
A roller coaster.

133
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,803
And um,
except for the sex stuff that is all 

134
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:09,630
written,
that was very dramatic,

135
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:10,650
Papa.
I mean,

136
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:11,484
I don't know in his mind he really sees 
this as a big pizza war when people are 

137
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:17,670
picking sides there.
He has a lot of support.

138
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,520
I mean there's people demonstrating 
outside the White House right now,

139
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,623
Free Papa

140
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,000
and his mind.
And it's fine.

141
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,160
It's a,
it really is a war right now.

142
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:34,161
But when Papa John's and Papa Johns,
Papa Johns exist without Papa John.

143
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,160
No,
just like when the civil war happened,

144
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,600
a country divided cannot stand as the 
Abraham Lincoln famously said.

145
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,723
And I feel that Papa John is kind of a 
pizza civil rights leader in his own 

146
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:51,861
right when the Cold War.
This isn't a hot or this is a hot oven.

147
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,930
A cheesy on other than about.
Oh,

148
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:01,420
this is just his life story.
Um,

149
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,573
new.
He's actually got all the legal papers 

150
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,730
because he's suing Papa John.
It's like,

151
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:10,510
dude,
y'all started a war with a fucking.

152
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,680
Make sure you could finish it.
He's got feed some money.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,430
Anyway,
I just loved his little cover letter.

154
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,540
So pop.
I wish you all the best in your fight.

155
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,330
There's a standing invitation for Papa 
to complete his case on our show.

156
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,780
We had previously reached out and better
times,

157
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,780
and I have to say papa passed.
He said,

158
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:35,614
I got Peyton manning throwing pizzas 
into the American living rooms of 

159
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,140
everywhere.
Now all the sudden.

160
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,530
Who would you have left?
Papa?

161
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,900
Who Do you have left?
Me.

162
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,150
That's who it's time to.
Come on this show.

163
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:52,330
Bring the butter garlic sauce because 
we're going to have a good old fashion.

164
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,820
Reach around soggy pizza.
Anyone know what that is?

165
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,500
Soggy,
soggy pizza when the pizza got saggy.

166
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,730
Or is this like a metaphor for something
else?

167
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,810
Is it Swiss?
Papa knows I'm Alex Jones is in the news

168
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,694
again,
but this time you may not expect why 

169
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,110
this,
this story just cracked me up.

170
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,160
I had to talk about this.
All right,

171
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,730
now Alex Jones.
Uh,

172
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,860
you know and love him.

173
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,980
You guys.
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:30,160
I think our stream just got pulled down.
Why?

175
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,180
No,
I'm just kidding.

176
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,100
You going to ask you.
I felt for them.

177
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,760
I let him go look.
So stupid.

178
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,280
I was going to make a joke like that.
Dan,

179
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,083
come on.
You guys need to coordinate the jokes 

180
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:43,481
here.
Well,

181
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:46,030
he gives me.
Well I am,

182
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,270
I am somewhat hesitant to mention the 
boogie man's name.

183
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:54,271
Alex Jones.
J A J.

184
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,190
um,
so he,

185
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:57,900
you know,
Mr.

186
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,733
Mr.
turn the frogs gay was doing a 

187
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,323
advertisement during his show recently.
Let me show you the video that he was 

188
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,334
watching and,
and tell me if you catch something in 

189
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:17,290
this video because it's fried.
It's brief,

190
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,310
but the um,
the internet super,

191
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,950
super sleuths did find it.
So watch closely.

192
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:24,770
No,

193
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,603
I heard about it from family and then 
George Dorian and others that I had to 

194
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:29,370
get involved.
Info wars?

195
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:33,090
Yes.
At infowars.com

196
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,370
to go look all of this up.

197
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,520
Oh,
did you catch it?

198
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,880
No.
How does he talk?

199
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,850
How does that guide that end of the day?
Talk to her.

200
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,800
Um,
I like that is,

201
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,020
he's all jacked up advertising in 
nutrition when it's.

202
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,390
Sorry,
it's the Alex Jones voice.

203
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:59,500
Fuck my throat up.
Or was he doing an ad for skincare?

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,620
I love it.
He's so funny,

205
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,300
man.
He thought he puts on so many hats,

206
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,134
like he'll,
he'll advertise anything and all of a 

207
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,920
sudden he's doing info wars.
Yes.

208
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:11,290
It's like a Martha Stewart brand.
If it was.

209
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,340
Yes.
Get your skincare products over here at.

210
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,270
Well.
Anyway,

211
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,103
so what was that George?
Nora and others that I had to get 

212
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,560
involved.
Info wars.

213
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:21,394
Yes.
There's no space in that informs 

214
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,300
cash.com
to go look all of the

215
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,803
looks like flesh.
So he's showing all of his open tab 

216
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,790
browsing and.
Oh Shit.

217
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,913
Yeah.
So the Internet super sleuth went to 

218
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:43,270
work crunching the numbers.
A touring the frogs gay.

219
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,900
And what came up will shock you.
Here it is.

220
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,380
The title of the video in question was 
naughty t babe Marissa minks.

221
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,450
Relieved of caulk.
Hunger by stuck.

222
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,690
Can I open?
Can I show this?

223
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,490
Let me see if I can show an image of 
this.

224
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,620
Um,
yeah.

225
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,410
I can't show the porn.
You know,

226
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:12,221
that,
that thing.

227
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:13,054
But it's basically,
I mean really all you need is that 

228
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:16,900
title.
Let me read that for you again,

229
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:19,840
if I can.
Knotty.

230
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,900
T Babe stands for trans.
So grill,

231
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,080
penis,
for those who are not initiated,

232
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,990
she's naughty.
Tba.

233
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,860
Marissa minks.
Relieved of caulk.

234
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,870
Hunger by Stud.
That's how that is A.

235
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,030
I don't even understand half of the 
sentence.

236
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm really.
What do you want me to break down?

237
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,863
Naughty teabag.
She's a naughty girl with a big old 

238
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,780
thick presumably.
Okay.

239
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,770
She and then her name is Marissa and 
beings and she has.

240
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,590
She has an insatiable hunger.
She is so thirsty for COC.

241
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,080
She's so hungry.
She's relieved.

242
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,920
She's fine.
She has this insatiable hunger for coc,

243
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,900
but yet.
But what's this done?

244
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,420
I feel like I know that.
I want to make sure that if the guy that

245
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:08,900
fucks.
Okay,

246
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,710
think it goes back to a horse.
It's a horse though,

247
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,711
but it's like that guy's a fucking stud.
So this girl with this insatiable hunger

248
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:17,764
for coc has finally after all of her 
searching on the earth for this one 

249
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:24,370
study that could relieve for thirst for 
coc,

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
she was relieved of Caulk,
hunger by Stud.

251
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,060
So that's pretty interesting.
I'm not one to judge,

252
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:38,380
you know,
watch whatever you want.

253
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:39,214
But it is Alex Jones and he did have a 
video titled Naughty Tba Marie Main 

254
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,350
Relieved,
relieved of caulk hunger.

255
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,360
I love the Alex Jones was watching that.
He hasn't addressed it by the way.

256
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Oh,
I mean how,

257
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,750
what do say yes,
she was relieved of our hunger.

258
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,770
To be fair,
he may,

259
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,633
he may have addressed it,
but I hunted really hard and that this 

260
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,850
is such outstanding news that if you,
if you google anything related to this,

261
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:09,620
all you're going to find his articles 
about,

262
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,800
you know,
this insatiable tb.

263
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,860
The interesting thing about Alex Jones 
watching a transport is that heat,

264
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:23,240
one of his strikes that he got before 
the closure of his gentle was four.

265
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,470
He called Trans people mentally ill.
Oh,

266
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,150
that's nice because like you maybe 
mentally ill,

267
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:29,984
but I'm,
I mean that doesn't mean I can't beat 

268
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:31,724
off to it.
Does that make him mentally ill if he 

269
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:37,640
likes it?
I guess it does.

270
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,600
By calling.
Maybe would have said.

271
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,900
Couldn't make him say that.
I just love.

272
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,760
This is so funny.
So funny man.

273
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,060
I'm so relieved of caulk hunger.
Next time you see Alex Jones,

274
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,410
just remember that by

275
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,193
hmm.

276
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,873
Nice little story.
Great little story which we had Alex 

277
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,970
Jones to call him and tell us about 
[inaudible] 90 day fiance.

278
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,440
Love this show.
We've talked about a lot about the show.

279
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,120
Ninety Ninety Day fiance.
Yeah.

280
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:19,710
And Fisa and George the a gold digger 
Isa.

281
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,150
So this store,
this,

282
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,240
this show is just a goldmine.
Ninety day fiance eats well here.

283
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:30,980
I thought this show was like an old 
show,

284
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:32,420
but it's still going.
Oh Man.

285
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,100
I mean it may have been around for,
I don't know.

286
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:37,070
How long has it been around?
Just looks like it's from the night is.

287
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

288
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,543
But it's still going.
I got to set dvr to record this show 

289
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:46,730
because it seems like got to be one of 
the more entertaining shows on TV.

290
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,533
Um,

291
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,863
so this lady has married,
I believe in African and she is an 

292
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:57,530
Africa visiting the family now.
The family,

293
00:16:57,531 --> 00:17:02,531
one of their native dishes is snails and
she's very hesitant to eat the snails,

294
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,473
which makes sense to me,
but be respectful in their face of your 

295
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:11,540
fiance's family and you meet the snails 
and you enjoy them.

296
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,823
Right.
Okay.

297
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,000
She's,
you know,

298
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,730
she doesn't seem to be someone who has a
problem eating food,

299
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,420
so she doesn't seem necessarily that she
should have a problem putting it down.

300
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:23,254
But

301
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,060
yeah,
it looks good.

302
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,440
It looks cooked up.
I mean

303
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,840
got a little nice like tomato sauce in 
there.

304
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,250
Little creamy.
Okay.

305
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,183
So native dish.
Just a central person except for being 

306
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,670
respectful to his mom for every meal.

307
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,100
I'm going to taste.
She out there,

308
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,990
but God,
I'm terrified right now.

309
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,273
It's very quiet.
It's a quiet predestined is I'm a boost 

310
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,030
in it as much as possible.
So cell phone quality.

311
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,510
If she takes a little bite and going 
okay with it,

312
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,410
he ripped off and sent her mouth and a 
kiss me,

313
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,420
her fiance,
me and get it out of my mouth.

314
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,700
Oh,
they're watching by the way,

315
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,090
you're not slipping up.
So what are you doing?

316
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,970
They saw that.
Yeah.

317
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,133
So she basically said to her fiance,
kiss me and let me spit it into your 

318
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,330
mouth so that I don't have to chew it 
anymore.

319
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,060
That's not paying respect to anyone.
I mean,

320
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,580
that's horrifying thing to witness.
Just handed out on your plate and say,

321
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:53,890
hey man,
hey for me.

322
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,590
Hey,
come here.

323
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,580
Pretend to kiss me.
I'll spit in your mouth.

324
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,450
Nobody will know.
They're all like,

325
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,500
they're all like cameras staring right 
at you.

326
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,710
And it was like three cameras watching.
Hey,

327
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,360
let's get.
Let's get another one of that day.

328
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,510
Let's get a slow mo if we can put it in 
the slower.

329
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:15,250
The speed here.
No,

330
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,840
no,
no.

331
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,190
Yeah man.
Let's see.

332
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,450
Let's get a close look.
Guess me.

333
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,003
She's like,
damn,

334
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,780
I only don't.
She's like,

335
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:29,400
I only fuck with butter.
Garlic sauce.

336
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,030
Say Papa.
Say Papa John Dot Com.

337
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,100
This white American.
This takes on a whole new vibe here.

338
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,350
Coaster comes to past and that is a 
romantic kiss

339
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,850
I've ever seen.
One sucks

340
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:53,963
right out of her mouth.
Any fucking choose it to that God damn 

341
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:58,950
mvp.
That guy just saved the day.

342
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,150
Thank you Michael.

343
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,280
And he's like,
man,

344
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:04,114
the things I do for a green card,
these relationships on these shows are 

345
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,320
really all about getting a green card.
I don't think any of these relationships

346
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:13,154
were genuine.
So it's really what's so interesting 

347
00:20:15,351 --> 00:20:16,184
about this show is like,
what is this one person is willing to 

348
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:20,750
take?
Right?

349
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,933
It's like one eligible datable person 
matched up with one completely 

350
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:26,054
undateable person and then you kind of 
just see how much that one datable 

351
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:30,883
person can do indoor for a green card.
And I think that guy in this moment 

352
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:38,910
reached his limit it did it.
No.

353
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,983
Yeah,
he did it.

354
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,383
Hmm.

355
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,650
Am Very special stuff.
Guys.

356
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,073
Want shows on fire today.
Are you saying that you wouldn't suck a 

357
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:52,990
snail out of [inaudible] mouth?
I suck.

358
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,880
I suck.
Garlic butter sauce out of your mouth.

359
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,650
In fact,
I think I have in fact.

360
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:57,401
Isla.
No,

361
00:20:57,401 --> 00:21:02,401
you are.
You sure did you know that I for me,

362
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,170
I'm going to go there to shows on fire 
today.

363
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,183
We are killing it.
All I'm saying is that next time you 

364
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,640
order Papa John Pizza,
Save Papa John Dot Com.

365
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,710
Try replacing.
Yeah.

366
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,730
You're a sex lube with butter,
garlic sauce and see if that doesn't get

367
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:29,300
you somewhere new.
Nice.

368
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,950
This is one of your advisors.
I read it on Safe Papa John Dot com.

369
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,670
It's under tabs of tech of techniques 
and strategies.

370
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,713
Nearing my asshole.
This is what we all came for a lot of 

371
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:44,254
debate over last week about wiping 
techniques about how best to approach 

372
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:52,450
the Asshole,
how best to clean it,

373
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:53,284
how best to manicure it.
I received an email from somebody that 

374
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:59,470
said they near their asshole and that it
changed their life for the better.

375
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,630
I was so intrigued because it was so 
insane.

376
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:04,320
So preposterous.
I have an idea that,

377
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:07,570
um,
I thought I had to try it out.

378
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,663
I'm Ila says,
why do I keep saying messing on 

379
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,503
strangers,
but you're getting messages from 

380
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:16,360
strangers on discord.
I wrote to Dan,

381
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,283
but yeah.
Well now I'm intrigued and you're 

382
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:20,854
getting bombed by strangers on discord.
I just keep saying all kinds of 

383
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:25,080
notifications on my cell.

384
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,010
I'm isla.
I'm talking about narrowing my asshole.

385
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:30,844
Can you please focus?
So I was trying to distract myself from 

386
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,540
the onset.
What the fuck they found you?

387
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,000
Who found her?
I don't know.

388
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,050
These are just like,
we're just in a private channel,

389
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:49,051
which was does.
I don't know who's Raz sneaking in.

390
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,073
Oh No.
Our private discourse getting 

391
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:54,144
infiltrated.
But we are talking about narrowing my 

392
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:57,664
asshole.
So if everyone could please focus 

393
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,690
almost.
Sorry.

394
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:01,660
Sorry.
So anyway,

395
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:02,494
I was about,
I was going to near my asshole because 

396
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:04,960
it just seems so insane.
I was like,

397
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,490
for the sake of the show,
let's do it.

398
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,190
Yeah.
But the other side of me was like,

399
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:12,700
this is kind of really weird,
insane thing to do.

400
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,630
And you could burn your skin.
Yeah.

401
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:18,610
And the asshole is pretty sensitive,
right?

402
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,270
Apparently from what I understand.
But then I also,

403
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,980
I had a feeling that this guy was 
fucking with me.

404
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,350
He seemed genuine,
but I can see someone be like,

405
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:30,184
I'm gonna get Ethan and narrows asshole 
knowing full well that would ruin my 

406
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:34,024
life.
So another great fan emailed me and was 

407
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:38,140
like,
dude,

408
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,980
do not near your app.
And here is why.

409
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:44,440
And he sent me this craigslist story 
that was so funny.

410
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,240
I had to read it to you because I had to
share it with you guys.

411
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,780
So for now this story alone put my 
narrow,

412
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:53,750
my asshole on.
Hold on,

413
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:55,130
hold on.
I'm still open to it.

414
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,870
Frankly.
We got the product at home.

415
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:57,590
Yeah,
I have the PR.

416
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,000
I got three.
I don't know why an Amazon.

417
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:01,780
They made me buy three bottles.
Looks like on this fucking weird guy.

418
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:06,810
It's just like I have an apocalypse,
a stash of narrowing my asshole.

419
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,450
Look,
the world may be ending,

420
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:10,970
but my asshole is going to be clean.

421
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,970
One of them was called involves bomb.
Oh yeah.

422
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:18,530
I wanted to say in my pursuit of the 
sensitive nature that would've burned my

423
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,543
asshole.
I found a product called balls bomb 

424
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,660
that's made for applying to your balls.
Balls.

425
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,450
Bomb Guy.
Got a bike,

426
00:24:27,451 --> 00:24:30,230
some balls bond.
So I don't know.

427
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:32,630
I've got balls bomb.
Yeah.

428
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,680
And I was thinking of just getting it,
just seeing what happens.

429
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,590
But you guys,
you guys read this and tell me.

430
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:41,210
I don't know.
This spooked me most.

431
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,130
Most definitely.
And it rang so true.

432
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,920
Let me zoom in on this.
So this was from craigslist,

433
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,110
it's called a warning,
don't shave that hair.

434
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,220
I've recently made a mistake in my life 
and I offer my story to you that you may

435
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:57,980
learn from my air.
It all started as many things to do with

436
00:24:57,981 --> 00:25:01,610
me having trouble shitting.
Did you write this?

437
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,680
No,
Dan,

438
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:04,940
I think we need some kind of music.

439
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,860
What kind of,
what kind of stories I want to play when

440
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,360
you play sad violin?
Let me,

441
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,690
let me try and find some.
Uh,

442
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:16,520
no.
I was not constipated.

443
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,910
This was not a regularity problem,
but a matter of technique.

444
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:25,100
It seems my ass hair had grown to such a
length that my tiny grope Grogan's we're

445
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:30,101
constantly getting tied up and the 
jungle between my ass cheeks.

446
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,993
It led so much frustration with me 
knowing that I still had something to 

447
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:39,851
drop but not able to shake.
The tenacious turned loose from its butt

448
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:44,570
hair dwelling eventually would have to 
do two things,

449
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:47,760
either reached down with some paper and 
try to pinch off the lingering low,

450
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,093
which required careful precision to 
avoid smearing the creature over my 

451
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:52,304
rear.
Especially since I had no way of seeing 

452
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:55,154
what I was doing or just go for broke,
start wiping and hope that I can remove 

453
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,580
all the leftover fecal matter before the
toilet reached.

454
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,710
It's can't be flushed threshold.

455
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,290
I was contemplating this problem.
This is very long.

456
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,140
Yeah.
Can you cut through the paraphrase here?

457
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,990
Let me paraphrase.
So Yada,

458
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:17,860
Yada,
Yada.

459
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,753
He did the deed.
Now I have great respect for anal hair 

460
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,020
like everything in this world God 
created.

461
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:25,120
It has.
It's all my purpose and existence.

462
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,413
It was only after I had removed it that 
I started to learn how much I had been 

463
00:26:29,141 --> 00:26:31,090
taking it for granted.
For one,

464
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:31,924
it provides friction.
I learned that this next day when I 

465
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:35,770
walked out into the sun,
the headed for class.

466
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,590
After climbing two flights of stairs and
starting to sweat,

467
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,600
I started to notice something 
unpleasant.

468
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:41,434
The sweat was accumulating in my crap 
and what's causing the unpleasant 

469
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:48,390
sensation of Mike to ask Jake sliding 
past each other with every step.

470
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,410
I thought about going to the bathroom 
and starting the wipe it off,

471
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,910
but I had to go to class.

472
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,840
I thought eventually it would drive.
Unfortunately it did dry,

473
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,943
but only after mingling with the 
microscopic shit molecules lingering 

474
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:04,200
around my ground starfish.
Yes.

475
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,143
When I stood up after your class,
my ass chiefs were stuck together and a 

476
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,840
slimy sticky shit sweat combination.
As that made my way back to the dorm.

477
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,143
It started to itch God did it itch.
I felt like a swarm of ants was making 

478
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:22,890
its way up and down my craft fighting to
keep from jamming my hand down there and

479
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,350
scratching away.
I rushed back to the dorm.

480
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,100
Unfortunately again,
this excretion caused me to sweat.

481
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,760
And when I,
uh,

482
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,823
when I finally reached my room,
my cheeks were sliding back and forth 

483
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:38,040
against each other like a pair of Horny 
cane toads.

484
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,233
I quickly dropped my pants and attempted
to drive my ass by sticking it in front 

485
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:45,110
of a fan and spreading my cheeks.

486
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,640
As I pulled the two mounds of flesh 
apart,

487
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,770
a horrible stench burst free and filled 
the room.

488
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,650
Every dog within four blocks started the
house.

489
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,830
I had the worst of it as the ripe aroma,
a festering shit and sweat went into the

490
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:03,930
fan.
And my face,

491
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,850
I thought to keep from heaving as I sat 
there fighting,

492
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:13,320
vomit in my ass cheeks,
bread and tripping with the concentrated

493
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:17,910
aroma of my body odor mixed with the 
tangy smell of my own shit blowing right

494
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:19,590
into my face.
I only had one thought.

495
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,230
I will be like this until my hair grows 
back.

496
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,560
For weeks later on trying to deal as 
best I could,

497
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,693
wiping my asset every opportunity I 
discovered another wonderful use for 

498
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:33,210
this ass hair ventilation.
I attempted to launch a fart only to get

499
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,420
it stuck between my ass cheeks.
Apparently with no hair.

500
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:40,020
The two pink twins kind of get vacuumed,
sealed together.

501
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,370
And the result was a frustrating fart 
that slid up and down between my cheeks,

502
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,760
like a last durable as if there wasn't 
enough.

503
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:48,594
I am known during further torture as 
anyone who has ever shaved anything 

504
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:55,260
knows when hair is growing,
it becomes stubble.

505
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,230
I imagine your ass having the texture of
a Brillo pad.

506
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,770
Well that is what I'm dealing with now 
is a hellish torture.

507
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:02,604
And there are times when I just look out
the window and contemplate why I 

508
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:09,170
shouldn't just jump out and get it all 
over with rather than indoor.

509
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,440
This agony.
Friends,

510
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:14,220
do not shave your ass here.
Wow.

511
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,580
But see,
see it.

512
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,510
Thank.
Thank you.

513
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,790
Um,
thank you for that anecdote.

514
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,780
But what I think about is,
um,

515
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,040
I love the lawyer was almost vomiting.
Yeah,

516
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,440
I definitely get that.
Like,

517
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,480
but he shaved.
Okay.

518
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:35,481
I'm narrowing.
Narrowing is like shaving the stubble.

519
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,280
I won't deal with the stub a while.
It will grow back.

520
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:40,050
So basically once you narrow your 
asshole,

521
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:43,330
you're stuck in a vicious cycle because 
once that stubble grows in and you're,

522
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,690
I can only imagine your asshole itching 
with every step.

523
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,673
You're back in there narrowing.
You're stuck in the net or stuck in a 

524
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:51,064
loop.
Yeah,

525
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,190
I'm going to be doomed to a hairless 
asshole forever.

526
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:57,820
Or I'm gonna have to like take two weeks
off that you can burn yourself.

527
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:58,803
Right?
And I keep telling you because I saw 

528
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:02,350
him,
but he was so entertaining to be like,

529
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,940
okay guys,
I narrowed my asshole.

530
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,620
I feel like.
But then I also don't want to be the guy

531
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:13,450
that narrowed his asshole.
You know what if I bought albums,

532
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:15,280
my asshole.
It's the same thing.

533
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,800
I do fear of the shit and sweat of 
ocean.

534
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:21,634
The potential of vomit.
God wouldn't be so great to hear you 

535
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:27,550
talk about the smell of my shit and 
swimming.

536
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,080
Yeah.
Because you'll be there.

537
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,050
I'll not be there.
You're going to leave me out.

538
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,940
He wasn't going to leave like damn I 
did.

539
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,450
It was doing it for you man.
I was not asking for this.

540
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,660
Well,
I'm still intrigued,

541
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:45,640
but the guy definitely spooked me 
straight.

542
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,760
I do want to tell you that the pole that
you did on twitter.

543
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,253
Oh yeah,
there hasn't been an update with the 

544
00:30:51,731 --> 00:30:55,330
numbers.
So let's open the pool actually.

545
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:59,260
So I was so interested in this debate 
we've been having with,

546
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,473
with,
from the front or from the back because 

547
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:03,340
again,
as I said,

548
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:07,900
there's two worlds of wipers and they 
don't even know that they exist.

549
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,973
And I felt like an outcast my whole life
for lifting up my balls and reaching 

550
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:14,290
under there.
Right.

551
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,470
And so I said,
I go to the HD podcasts on twitter,

552
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:20,410
the HD podcasts,
and I asked our loyal fans,

553
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,450
how do you wipe your ass from the front 
or from the back?

554
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,740
And it may surprise you,
but we have a lot of the,

555
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,850
a lot of results here.
First of all,

556
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,990
66,534
people participated.

557
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,160
So thank you.
I feel like this is an actual legitimate

558
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:39,994
census of the American public life.
This is for men only because women only 

559
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:45,664
have one option.
They're supposed to wipe away from the 

560
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,920
badge.
And um,

561
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,560
I do love the top comment here.
I don't think men wipe him.

562
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,630
And he said,
well,

563
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:57,130
I don't know who the fuck she's been 
with,

564
00:31:57,131 --> 00:32:01,270
but uh,
she's had a foul.

565
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:02,860
She said some foul relationships.

566
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,323
Maybe she dated that guy.
We were just reading really every time 

567
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:11,800
I've been with a guy just smells like 
ass and sweat.

568
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,433
Um,
so last time it was 60 slash 40 and now 

569
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:18,934
it's 60 1:39.
I feel like it's been brigaded by the 

570
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,950
front labors.
But anyway,

571
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,353
39 percent wiped from the front.
Those are like minded brethren who 

572
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:31,120
lifted their balls and prove and you 
know,

573
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,930
perform a scoop from the front.
It's really a scoop.

574
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:36,130
The way I do it.
It is.

575
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:39,590
It's a scoop and scoop.
It's a skilled scoop.

576
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,540
Is this group that I've been developing 
for a long time.

577
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:44,030
You lift the balls,
you scoop your clean baby,

578
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:45,920
you scoop the shit out.
This is a smear.

579
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:46,661
I don't know.
This is.

580
00:32:46,661 --> 00:32:47,494
You can't give it back,
but 61 percent a traditional white 

581
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,600
maybe.
But I like scoot.

582
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:56,540
You want to scoop out when you're 
dealing with a bowl,

583
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,740
you want to be scooping out.

584
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,830
You can't wipe the whole.
You scoop out of a hole.

585
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,840
Am I right?
Thirty one percent.

586
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,450
Thirty nine percent of you know exactly 
what I'm talking about.

587
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,580
Sixty one percent of you wiped from the 
back and that's pretty and I have to say

588
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:11,414
I'm kind of surprised by how many of 
them are out there like me that white 

589
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,610
from the front.
That's pretty.

590
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:18,350
I mean that's really close to 50 
percent.

591
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,243
That's a,
that's a 10 percent variance we're 

592
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:23,900
talking about.
So speak up front.

593
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:27,740
Wipers don't leave me in the trenches 
scoop and grenades out of my ass.

594
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,113
Okay.
Help me represent to the world that we 

595
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:32,540
are out there.
We are strong,

596
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,040
we are people and we have rights.
We are pumper John and go to [inaudible]

597
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,780
dot com and use butter.
Garlic.

598
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,890
I've heard that butter garlic sauce is 
so powerful.

599
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:45,290
It actually can act like Nair and 
burning the hair right off.

600
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,750
Just again.
I'm going to try plain butter.

601
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:49,320
Garlic sauce,
my asshole tonight.

602
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,940
See if that works.
Um,

603
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,620
so I thought that was an interesting 
scientific experiment.

604
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:55,454
We should do more poles because I feel 
like we're actually making an important 

605
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:58,310
contribution to science here.

606
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,680
Good.
We are really.

607
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:05,570
I feel like we're doing important things
here.

608
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:10,990
This is way more than the experience.
We have transcendent experience.

609
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,593
Podcasts.

610
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,943
Moment of silence and clarity.
We'll be right back after this break 

611
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,620
with Logan Paul,
verse Ksi.

612
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,550
Stay tuned.
Okay.

613
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,460
Deal like free money because that.
Oh,

614
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,680
thank you.
You wasn't expecting a response.

615
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,920
Now that I know you like free money,
would you like to hear about honey?

616
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,510
Because that's what it does.
Is it an extension for your browser that

617
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:43,344
browses the website,
the whole Internet for the perfect 

618
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:49,330
coupon for whatever you're shopping for?
Oh,

619
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,050
I'm on Amazon trying to buy dog food.
Oh honey,

620
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,030
boom coupon.
Whoa.

621
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,983
Just save me money like an old man 
clipping coupons by the fireplace every 

622
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:00,930
evening for you for free.
Honey.

623
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,093
That should be their slogan.
An old man clipping coupons for you as 

624
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:07,230
you browse.
Don't believe me.

625
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,400
The Lincoln,
the description,

626
00:35:08,401 --> 00:35:09,234
join [inaudible] dot com slash h three 
has saved people collectively over 

627
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,580
$102,000
in the past couple of months.

628
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:17,790
That's an average saving of $25 per 
person.

629
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,200
You also maybe thinking the honey 
doesn't work at sites that I shop at.

630
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:22,891
Well,
the truth is,

631
00:35:22,891 --> 00:35:26,040
honey works on over 30,000
sites including Amazon,

632
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,360
Ebay,
new egg razor,

633
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:29,940
Walmart,
and more so much more.

634
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,760
Pretty much everywhere that I've 
shopped.

635
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:33,594
Honey,
he's like,

636
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,990
I love.
I love using it on Amazon.

637
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,973
Even shows you like the price history of
a product and if it's like the lowest 

638
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:46,110
now or not.
The big question is how was honey free?

639
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,973
What's the catch?
There's no catch your depths hunting 

640
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:51,750
gets a small commission from sites.
Every time they clip a coupon for you,

641
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,580
so it's always free.
There's no catch.

642
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,503
It's easy to install.
It takes a couple of clicks and then 

643
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,890
you're going to be off to the races 
saving cash.

644
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,873
Give it a shot.
It's free and it literally takes 10 

645
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:03,690
seconds to install.
So use the link in the description.

646
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:06,780
Join honey.com/h
three.

647
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,660

648
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,270

you're going to say,

649
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,500
Dang it,
Ethan.

650
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,000
Thank you for joining honey.com/h
three.

651
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,973
Welcome back everybody.
I'm out of breath from running to the 

652
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,680
bathroom.
Isla is not back yet.

653
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,273
Did we?
Where are we at a screen or was the 

654
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:39,990
comeback?
Slick and perfect.

655
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,720
Then we did have to go to the screen for
about five seconds.

656
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,240
I had just gone to the screen as you 
open the door.

657
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,080
We went to a screen.
Oh No,

658
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,253
not at this day would come now.
Here you come in quiet because you 

659
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:53,550
turned it down.
Oh,

660
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:55,860
okay.
Damn.

661
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,900
We gotta we gotta get out of this 
office,

662
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,280
this office we're in so fucking small.
You've got to run to the bathroom.

663
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,680
We're looking for new office.
Five second slate screen.

664
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,810
Oh my God.
We just got.

665
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:15,620
We just got demoted to experience.
Oh,

666
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,643
we were transcendent,
but we just got back down from 

667
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:22,260
enlightenment.
Back to the experience and too harsh.

668
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,743
Okay.
Well let's get right onto the main 

669
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:29,820
story.
Logan Paul,

670
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:35,020
Verse Ksi.
Everybody is talking about Logan Paul,

671
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:37,710
Verse Ksi,
the boxing match.

672
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,340
Isla,
who do you think?

673
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:44,640
One?
I already know what happened because you

674
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:45,474
think one.

675
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:52,780
I'm a cylon.
It was a tie.

676
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,340
Okay.
Suspicious.

677
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,700
I'll show you guys.
I'll show you guys.

678
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,740
Let's go over some stats.
Okay.

679
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,220
I find this stuff really interesting.
Before I kind of talked about Logan,

680
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:09,300
Paul Brest,
Ksi,

681
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:10,890
the boxing match.
You guys have all heard of it.

682
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,720
I kind of got to give credit to these 
guys because even if you hate them both,

683
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:19,170
it's just irresistible.
Irresistible.

684
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,390
You got attack about it.
You gotTa love it.

685
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:26,010
I mean really it's pretty cool and,
and it was pretty slick.

686
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,050
I have to,
I honestly have to give them credit.

687
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,810
They,
they masterminded this crazy thing.

688
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,290
They saw that this arena,
they have eight.

689
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,690
How many?
800 paperview viewers.

690
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,300
That's right.
I got it.

691
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,090
I got to give him it up,
man.

692
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,283
I'll pay off.

693
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,670
It was definitely pretty exciting.
I'm like,

694
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,790
on the day of like everyone was talking 
about it.

695
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,243
Pretty cool.

696
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,810
Definitely some great memorable moments 
in there that I'd like to share with you

697
00:38:56,811 --> 00:38:57,644
guys.
But on the whole I just want to say I'm 

698
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:01,670
not going to sit there and hate.
Okay.

699
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,350
I want to say I got to give these guys 
some credit where it's due.

700
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,343
Yeah,
definitely taking this whole online 

701
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:12,560
youtube experience to,
to a new level.

702
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,060
Um,
so general admission tickets started at.

703
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,750
I,
I'm,

704
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,583
I,
I want to break this down because 

705
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:27,200
they've always said this fight is bigger
than mayweather verse make rigor.

706
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,210
And I've heard a lot of people say that.

707
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,120
I understand that because that is such a
ridiculous.

708
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,780
I've heard them say,
and I've heard other people reporting on

709
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:36,380
it being like I heard,
um,

710
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,540
I've heard it in really reputable places
have been,

711
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:44,020
like they had more views than they are.
Press conference had more views,

712
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:46,720
more hype.
So I do want to break it down.

713
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:48,070
I want to compare.
I want you,

714
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,680
I want to show what,
what's going on here.

715
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,660
I mean Logan Paul,
Verse Ksi,

716
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:53,494
that's,
you can't really get more hype online 

717
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:00,370
than that.
It's like Max hype.

718
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,330
I mean,
what,

719
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,210
what could you put together that's 
better than that shoe?

720
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:09,211
Nice for Joey Salads.
Would you guys watch for as Joey Salads?

721
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:16,010
I would be scared to put shoe and sent 
Britain niche audience that thing.

722
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,753
Somehow I don't see that point.
Eight hundred thousand page views to 

723
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,930
shoe.
Nice Wood.

724
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:27,931
Fucking eat his opponent.
I want to see that.

725
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,583
I mean don't.
The only real option to get more than 

726
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:36,410
them would be something like a pod by 
pod.

727
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,920
Like Ryan's toy review

728
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,410
beat the shit out of a 12 year old.
Oh yeah,

729
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:44,230
I'd watch that.
Um,

730
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,900
so here's,
here's some stats for you guys.

731
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:47,843
Okay?
A general admission ticket started at 

732
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,024
$39 with the highest price.
Going to 600 average was probably like 

733
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:59,230
50 bucks a.
They sold out the arena,

734
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,093
right?
Dan?

735
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,353
I,
I think they sold out what they were 

736
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:06,040
offering.
I think the arena actually sits 20,000

737
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,950
and they only have 15,000
available for something,

738
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,520
so they sold 15,000
live attendee.

739
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,420
Take.
Why you smiling?

740
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:14,870
You though.
Are you laughing?

741
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,510
Just looking at our notes.
Oh,

742
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,290
we've got funny notes.
Oh,

743
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,413
it's just our notes are funny.
Heads up people with keep defining 

744
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,380
story.
We did.

745
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,990
What did we skip?
But we could go back to it later and bed

746
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,230
a couple of.
Oh well hang on.

747
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,040
This is so related to everything we were
talking about,

748
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,980
but now it's confusing.
Get to it later.

749
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,503
Oh Man.
This young couple was using nair on 

750
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:50,210
their assholes.
I'm Ksi.

751
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,070
So they sold 50,000
live attendees.

752
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,920
They took him about $2 million at the 
box office.

753
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:57,050
That's okay.
I mean,

754
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,490
who am I?
That's great.

755
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,413
That's amazing.
Okay.

756
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,050
Eight hundred thousand youtube streams.
That's incredible.

757
00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:07,170
That is incredible.
It was $10 per a paper review,

758
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,000
so that's about 10 million bucks in 
revenue.

759
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,970
And um,
what do you.

760
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,140
What'd you write here?
Oh,

761
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,180
keep in mind 1 million plus.
Oh yeah.

762
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,770
Over a million people were watching 
illegally on twitch,

763
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,343
which is pretty funny.
I saw a picture of twitch staff was in 

764
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:30,710
the illegal room,
like for twitch staff for watching.

765
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,933
They made this a press release,
like we were trying as hard as we could 

766
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:39,380
to remove.
So that is crazy revenue,

767
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:40,214
but you gotta also remember those 
probably such crazy costs and sane cost 

768
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,390
in putting it together and say,
let me put it this way.

769
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,360
We were considering doing a show at the 
ace theater,

770
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:51,194
which we never did,
but the cost of paying the venue alone 

771
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,860
was like close to 50 percent of the 
take.

772
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,250
And this was a crazy event.
Huge.

773
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,580
Yeah.
I was kind of like really professional.

774
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,830
$10,000,000
may sound like a lot,

775
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,250
but considering how many people were 
involved and the.

776
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,370
And I mean Logan,
Paul and Ksi are super rich.

777
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:17,570
So getting $2,000,000
for a single payday sounds good.

778
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:20,720
But the scope of what it was,
I was like,

779
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,940
hmm.
It doesn't seem like that much money.

780
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:23,774
When you think about mayweather and 
Mcgregor Mayweather got paid like 

781
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:29,600
$300,000,000
alone,

782
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,730
right?
Dan Was it 300 million?

783
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,350
Yeah,
that's what I.

784
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:34,780
I don't think there's actually.
Oh,

785
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,990
here.
Official figure.

786
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:37,940
It's speculated.
300.

787
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:42,320
So mayweather made $300.
Million and Mcgregor get made a $100.

788
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,140
Like how the fuck was that big of a 
difference of money?

789
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,940
It's huge.
I was like,

790
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:48,320
what?
That's so much more.

791
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,370
That was really.
So I.

792
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,640
If I had the guests,
I don't know if they had sponsors and so

793
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,130
I guess that Ksi and Logan Paul each 
made like,

794
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,880
I don't even know that they each made $5
million.

795
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,920
I don't think there was that much money 
involved.

796
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,480
No,
no way.

797
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:07,400
Because the Logan.
Paul definitely made a good amount.

798
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:08,900
They're fine,
they're fine.

799
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:09,763
They made.
They made enough money to buy a house 

800
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:12,380
with cash.
But it was.

801
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,170
Dave made something cool,
man.

802
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,223
GotTa give it up.
So here I want to do them so much time 

803
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,190
to organize the whole thing.
Well,

804
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:21,740
the training's not really amazing work.
It's like,

805
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,690
no,
no,

806
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,840
it's insane.
The training,

807
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:26,450
the promotion,
they were like this whole narrative.

808
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:27,560
They were sewing.
I mean,

809
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:28,423
well I think the peripheral hype was 
really beneficial for them to like all 

810
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:34,950
their videos and everything.

811
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,220
We're getting way more views than usual.
So it's like,

812
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,810
it's kind of this next level of logging 
where you're creating like this crazy,

813
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:44,490
like real draw.
I mean,

814
00:44:44,491 --> 00:44:47,220
it was extremely orchestrated.
These guys are best friends.

815
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:49,440
They're fucking loving it.
They're straight up butter,

816
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:50,221
garlic,
garlic,

817
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:53,160
saucing each other reaching around.
Double Hand Job Right now.

818
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,630
Straight up.
Satisfying.

819
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:59,631
They're insatiable hunger before they're
fine if they what narrowed.

820
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:04,470
Oh yeah,
Bro.

821
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:05,304
You know that Ksi narrowed his asshole 
and Logan Paul ate that ass clean by 

822
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,870
insatiable,
insatiable hunger.

823
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,530
That is the best state.
I love the title.

824
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:18,180
What was the title of that?
Uh,

825
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:21,720
uh,
what was the title of that video?

826
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,430
Because I feel like I can't forget.
I mean,

827
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,220
scroll up you guys,
we're gonna,

828
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,850
we're gonna rewind here.
A relieved of caulk hunger.

829
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,060
So they were relieved of their cock 
hunger for each other.

830
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,283
It's like when you teach a language 
where like teaching you how to use this 

831
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:43,180
sentence,
I feel like that that's,

832
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,670
that phrase has got to live in infamy on
relieved of caulk hunger.

833
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,613
Um,
so I think like not only was it about 

834
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,124
their payday from this single fight,
but everything around it was so hyped 

835
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,870
and so big that it was greatly to the 
benefit.

836
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:02,970
Are you being.
Did we say,

837
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,150
well we're an actual results for people 
don't know.

838
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,390
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

839
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:15,120
So mayweather versus macgregor just for 
comparison.

840
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:19,800
Four point 4 million paper view buyers.
That's insane.

841
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,993
That is insane.
Especially when you consider that the 

842
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:27,441
purchase price of that was $100.
That equals 440 million.

843
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,463
It wasn't St.
everybody was glued to the whole Vegas 

844
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,930
was about.
Defy actually was really weird.

845
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:40,440
We were playing blackjack and the hard 
rock and,

846
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,140
and,
and it was a weird,

847
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:42,974
weird thing where only certain hotels 
had the license to play it even though 

848
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:46,680
you can just buy it.

849
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,010
I find that so weird.
We could go play and watch it on all the

850
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:54,510
therapies and found out.
So then,

851
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:57,360
um,
Austin's bodyguard had his brother,

852
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,420
he had his cell phone on the living room
table,

853
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,420
live streaming on instagram,
on Instagram,

854
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:04,254
his TV,
and so we were watching a livestream of 

855
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,760
instagram,
of a,

856
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:12,810
of a recording of a TV and then random 
livestream ended up having like 10,000

857
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:13,644
viewers by the time.
Then when we found out that it wasn't a 

858
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:16,194
whole team,
there were thousands of people doing 

859
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:18,361
that.
Yeah,

860
00:47:18,361 --> 00:47:19,194
it's kind of hard to take it down.
But like there was a huge crowd behind 

861
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:23,514
us to just to watch on this little 
iphone because you couldn't find it 

862
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:27,510
anywhere.
Well anyway,

863
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:28,823
that's 440 and I just a,
I looked it up again that four point $4 

864
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,170
million.
That's just domestic,

865
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:36,004
that's just us paper.
So overseas it's probably another 

866
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:39,933
million.

867
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:46,150
So that's the live tickets generated $55
million.

868
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:46,984
What the fuck were they charging people?
I think ringside tickets were probably 

869
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:51,870
thousands of dollars.
Tens of thousands.

870
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:56,140
Probably total estimate.
They brought in $600.

871
00:47:56,141 --> 00:48:00,190
Million to do that as close to a billion
dollars from one five crazy.

872
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,650
So Mayweather,
as we said,

873
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,000
got $300,
million mcgregor paid 100 million.

874
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,950
I was just really curious because it was
like why?

875
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,120
I mean like four point four verse 800 is
a big difference,

876
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:13,270
but I mean having a million live viewers
is pretty significant,

877
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:17,440
but I guess at 10,
$10 makes a big difference.

878
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,290
Well anyway,
just a little comparison there.

879
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:23,740
They were very far from,
from the most popular,

880
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:26,410
but again,
to their credit that's a huge event.

881
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,370
We're talking about like the biggest 
live event of all time.

882
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,190
So I just thought it was interesting to 
compare those two events.

883
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,300
Now let's talk about that fight itself.
Shall We?

884
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:40,750
Uh,
J dot Paul,

885
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:45,130
one in the fifth round out of six via a 
technical knockout.

886
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:47,730
They ended it.
But you know what,

887
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:52,770
even though Jake Paul did,
when it seems that the most entertaining

888
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:53,914
and talked about moment of the night was
this image of Jake Paul with a bloody 

889
00:48:57,821 --> 00:49:01,000
nose.
So shout out to comedy shorts Gamer.

890
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:02,500
He looked dazed and confused.

891
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,043
Hmm.

892
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:06,923
That's going to be a lot of people's 
twitter profiles on like a lot of 

893
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:11,460
avatars.
Well,

894
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,353
I don't,
I don't want to take too much pride and 

895
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:14,380
the guy,
he's fine by the way.

896
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,001
Yeah,
he's one,

897
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:18,430
he's fine.
It's just pretty,

898
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,230
pretty great.
I guess.

899
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,510
I don't know.
So that was apparently,

900
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:27,511
that was the highlight of the night,
which it doesn't say much.

901
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,330
Here's a video of Jake Paul being 
punched in the face 40 times.

902
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,890
They've been super strict on the copper 
itself.

903
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:40,891
So I guess this one is editorial enough.
So here you go.

904
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,550
How many times was Jake Paul punched in 
the face?

905
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,280
People really hate Jake Paul.
They're like,

906
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,400
yes,

907
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,573
right.

908
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,680
Lots of people allowing them to kids.
I feel like anyway,

909
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,940
it wasn't than just telling us 30.
Just it is now at Lingq.

910
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:08,200
Who knows how many million?
10 million a lot,

911
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:09,490
man.
I got to say he's,

912
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:11,920
he's more likable than Logan.
Right?

913
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:12,491
I agree.
I mean,

914
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:14,060
he,
when he was a guest on our,

915
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:15,520
on our show,
he was,

916
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:16,873
I,
I,

917
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,733
he came out looking much better and I 
think everyone had a sense of 

918
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,890
appreciation for him,
you know,

919
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,980
that said,
let's watch him get back for and said,

920
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,260
let us,
watch him get punched in the face.

921
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,880
Definitely landings from solid punches.
A veggie definitely land.

922
00:50:40,221 --> 00:50:45,221
It's installed punches now as I've heard
it is jake.

923
00:50:45,931 --> 00:50:50,160
Paul was significantly larger,
taller,

924
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,610
taller,
longer,

925
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:54,680
right.
There was not really a fair match up by,

926
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,240
by uh,
definitely.

927
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,560
Apparently Jake Paul was

928
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,750
forced to slouch down because at the 
height difference in the size difference

929
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:07,120
was so great.
But Hey,

930
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,253
shout out to a dog for getting 40.
Slamming good solid punches to the 

931
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,770
fucking dome.
Not Bad.

932
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,040
Not Bad.
How's that?

933
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,340
It was this,
I don't know,

934
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,280
some guy should I say.
Dang.

935
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,333
Good.
Good.

936
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,440
Thank you too.
Thank you to dank again.

937
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,400
Take a good you.
Yeah.

938
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,200
Um,
this was pretty funny.

939
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:44,080
Tell honestly,
post fight interview with Jake.

940
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:46,540
This just shows you this rivalry.
I,

941
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,260
I've always said and suspect that Jake 
and logan actually hate each other.

942
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,333
Deep,
deep hatred of each other and this kind 

943
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:55,540
of proves like,
here's Jake's big moment,

944
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,093
by the way,
since when did,

945
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,290
when did jake.
He's got a kid.

946
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:00,640
They call them little jake.
Paul.

947
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:02,110
He doesn't have a kid,
right?

948
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,730
What A.
No.

949
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:10,600
So here he's doing his post fight 
interview and his love and belonging and

950
00:52:10,601 --> 00:52:13,130
he's enjoying his victory and his 
brother.

951
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:17,320
That's what the fuck.
I want to know what did what,

952
00:52:17,321 --> 00:52:18,400
what do you.
When the boxing match,

953
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:23,401
you get a kid and that kid's going to be
such a piece of shit when it grows up.

954
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,600
I just googled it.
I guess this is a meme.

955
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,420
There's a whole bunch of Little Jake 
Paul or mini Jake Paul.

956
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:36,450
They call them,
but who is he kidnapped?

957
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,080
I guess it was a bunch of pictures of 
guy.

958
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,070
This kid looks like me.
I'll take him.

959
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,220
It does look like.
Yeah,

960
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:46,690
I'm sure the related.
But when did you shit out a child?

961
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,460
There's no way to Ken,

962
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,060
you know what this kid is?
He's like,

963
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:53,894
um,
he's like from these Greek mythological 

964
00:52:57,081 --> 00:52:57,914
stories where it's like your first born 
is four toll to surpass you and 

965
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:06,110
subscribers and jake tries to like 
prevent it from happening,

966
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:11,510
but the kid ends up bigger and then he 
also fucks Jake's wife,

967
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:15,140
his mom.
Just like the Greek mythology.

968
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:17,810
I'm trying to make it interesting.
No,

969
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,533
oedipus anyone to own.
Not connecting too old for this 

970
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:24,891
audience.
That's my what?

971
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:26,280
I'm.
So anyway,

972
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:28,950
he's enjoying the limelight.
He's having a lot of fun.

973
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,113
Logan Paul comes in and steals the 
steals the thunder and it's a blast to 

974
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:36,670
watch.
Listen,

975
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,503
joy,

976
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,980
Jake,
Paul,

977
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,160
Little Jake.
What's up man?

978
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,430
What do you think that kid's going to be
doing at 18 years?

979
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:49,303
Hello?

980
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:53,580
It was a very cute kid and nobody knows.

981
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,710
Could be anything you want to.
Yeah.

982
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,310
You could be anything.
It could be the president,

983
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:00,900
right?
It could be an astronaut.

984
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,650
He's going to be great.
He's going to be raised really well by a

985
00:54:04,651 --> 00:54:07,260
punch of well adjusted people,
their dad for Napa.

986
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,540
Really good role model.
It's just a meme

987
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,940
that is a superstar and tonight you made
it yourself as well.

988
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:21,941
You're wearing that WBC amateur strap.
It was hard quite.

989
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,173
He was trying to care about.
Jake is really trying to care about 

990
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:41,600
jake.
He's really wants to care about him.

991
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:47,090
It seemed like maybe this going to be an
easy fight for the condition.

992
00:54:47,091 --> 00:54:50,600
What was the toughest part of it?
I think for me personally,

993
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:52,700
I got tired.
I don't know.

994
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,900
I watch logan.
You don't care about what Jake,

995
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,150
but watch logan in the back.
The the hardest thing.

996
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,043
Knowledges that there's an interview.
You see that he looks back like three 

997
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:00,870
times.
You see that?

998
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:01,704
Let me go back so you can.
Everyone acknowledged that and so in 

999
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:05,490
that moment he goes,
you know what?

1000
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:09,240
I'm going to fucking end this interview.
Like you can see the gears moving in his

1001
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:09,780
head,
Washington.

1002
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,780
He looks back my first fight maybe,
but I'm pushing through the fuck.

1003
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,910
Fuck.
All the attention is not on me.

1004
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,570
Look back so many times.
Okay,

1005
00:55:21,571 --> 00:55:22,710
now watch what happens.
Now.

1006
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:27,290
I was surprised by how much heart that 
you had.

1007
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,680
A much,
much respect to him for support.

1008
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:39,530
One of you in this room who's not paying
attention to me.

1009
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:44,300
Please turn the cameras towards me and 
all the interviews and all conversations

1010
00:55:44,301 --> 00:55:47,540
that are about me.
And please everybody focus.

1011
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:57,043
Yes.

1012
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,010
There is no fucking way.
Did with the second time.

1013
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:10,160
You're right.
Jake is so much more enjoyable.

1014
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,133
Yeah.
And in that interview he was being very 

1015
00:56:12,951 --> 00:56:15,620
gracious in victory and everything and 
just,

1016
00:56:15,621 --> 00:56:16,760
you know,
if you see the,

1017
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,260
I don't know if we're going to watch the
logan one,

1018
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:20,020
but Logan's like,
I fucking won that.

1019
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:22,490
I think this is bullshit.
We're not gonna watch it.

1020
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,381
Yeah,
it just.

1021
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:27,700
Jake is definitely necessary.
We need to give that look of Logan.

1022
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,470
Do I know?
Triple check.

1023
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,910
You literally did a triple check and he 
shut down the interview.

1024
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:35,530
So.
Great.

1025
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:36,363
That moment is just beautiful.
This is by Jake's new March dog shop R 

1026
00:56:52,731 --> 00:56:53,280
and B,
O dot.

1027
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,100
I don't know what this is,
but uh,

1028
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,900
does that make it okay?
I get new merge.

1029
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:59,940
Would that mean is march my March?
I'm Logan Paul.

1030
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,400
Merge to someone to say merchant might 
be a maverick Dotcom.

1031
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:07,800
I come visit you said you got tired,
you got.

1032
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:10,140
That's about all you need to see from 
that.

1033
00:57:10,141 --> 00:57:10,974
And that was great,
but I'm telling you that brotherly 

1034
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,330
rivalries thick as foss.

1035
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,130
And let me tell you that sauce is thick 
as it gets.

1036
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:22,810
Okay?
Delicious.

1037
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,410
Creamy,
insatiable hunger.

1038
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:31,470
Relieved of insatiable butter sauce.
Hunkered down.

1039
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:33,820
Anyway,
this shit's fucking gold.

1040
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:34,960
I love it.
Um,

1041
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,330
what else we got?
Okay,

1042
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,860
well guys,
listen,

1043
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:39,873
we've talked about Jake and Logan,
Paul and Ksi and dig and we've talked 

1044
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:46,030
about at all.
Hats off to them.

1045
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:47,883
But the fact of the matter is that the 
real fight is the one that we're all 

1046
00:57:55,421 --> 00:57:59,230
waiting for.
Frank invasion verse Ethan Bradbury.

1047
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,800
Now,
now there is a prelude to this.

1048
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,620
Um.
Oh,

1049
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:06,454
I didn't say it was a tie by the way.
The fight was a tie between Logan and k 

1050
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:12,670
center,
which for if you don't know,

1051
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:13,743
is extremely rare.
One of the rarest outcomes for a boxing 

1052
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:20,770
match extra.
Almost unheard of.

1053
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,253
So a lot of people are saying that the 
outcome was rig to help hype up their 

1054
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:33,280
second match and to that I say,
do you really think they would do that?

1055
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:38,200
And the answer is yes,
absolutely not.

1056
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:39,643
Well that is an interesting claim 
because as far as I could tell that 

1057
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:46,330
would be a pretty serious crime,
um,

1058
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:50,120
to fix a large sporting event like this.
But again,

1059
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,320
you know.
Yeah.

1060
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,540
Would they do this?
Yes,

1061
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:54,403
definitely.
Yes.

1062
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,120
I personally found the outcome pretty 
disappointed.

1063
00:58:59,121 --> 00:58:59,954
I would've been more excited if somebody
wants because then there's an underdog 

1064
00:59:02,721 --> 00:59:07,190
story going into the next fight,
but then that kind of makes it more real

1065
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,770
because they also want like the better 
story.

1066
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,460
Well I think they thought the tie was 
the better store.

1067
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,170
You'd think so.
Yeah.

1068
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:21,000
Does that mean the all the bookies one,
like what kind of bullshit is that?

1069
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:25,340
Like how many people bet on a tie the 
book,

1070
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:26,690
is that like.
Sorry.

1071
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:28,850
Hmm.
Pretty Shady.

1072
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,430
I agree.
It's pretty shady.

1073
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,673
Um,
are people going to be justice hype for 

1074
00:59:34,881 --> 00:59:37,400
the second fight?
I actually don't think so because in,

1075
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:39,110
in there,
first of all it's a tie.

1076
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:41,420
I think everyone's disappointed by that 
frankly.

1077
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,313
I think everyone's kind of over it.
And then the logan and ksi both made 

1078
00:59:46,401 --> 00:59:48,200
videos being like,
it was a great fight.

1079
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,050
I respect him so much and this whole 
facade of being like,

1080
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,270
I'm going to eat your children or 
whatever.

1081
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,840
That's the Mike Tyson.
Classical economics to your children.

1082
00:59:56,841 --> 00:59:59,840
Praise be to Allah.
Like Tyson.

1083
00:59:59,841 --> 01:00:02,030
Nobody can fucking sell a fight like 
Mike Tyson,

1084
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:05,060
he wants said to an opponent,
I'm going to eat your children.

1085
01:00:05,061 --> 01:00:07,110
Praise be to Allah.
I mean,

1086
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,293
shit,
I don't know how I'm better you sell 

1087
01:00:09,101 --> 01:00:09,934
fight.
And then that,

1088
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,370
um,
so back to.

1089
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:17,900
And I don't think that the second one's 
going to be as high because I think the,

1090
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,270
you know,
I think the illusion is busted that they

1091
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:21,770
hate each other.
But anyway,

1092
01:00:21,771 --> 01:00:22,604
I'll be there.
I'm going to be there and I'll tell you 

1093
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:24,674
what.
I want to send Joey Salads on a live 

1094
01:00:28,131 --> 01:00:30,830
report.
I want him to live stream it.

1095
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,720
We haven't asked you that way.
Yeah,

1096
01:00:34,721 --> 01:00:37,470
he's,
I think he's got to do meal,

1097
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:40,040
so anyway,
so that,

1098
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,870
that same day prank invasion tweets at 
me,

1099
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,353
me and either we're in Santa Cruz 
enjoying ourselves having a great 

1100
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:48,520
vacation and this honestly just made it 
even better for me.

1101
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,250
I had a blast with this.
He goes,

1102
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,210
by the way,
for full disclosure,

1103
01:00:55,211 --> 01:00:57,400
I was on the phone with frank invasion 
now on the phone,

1104
01:00:57,401 --> 01:01:00,250
but I was tweeting with him in dms and I
was like,

1105
01:01:00,251 --> 01:01:01,630
Hey,
do you want to do a know your main,

1106
01:01:01,631 --> 01:01:05,380
we'd all love to,
to talk to you and do a segment with you

1107
01:01:05,381 --> 01:01:06,214
because I mean you're been a consistent 
part of the show for so long and we 

1108
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:11,730
caught him.
He's becoming,

1109
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:13,053
starting to become self aware.
I feel like with his recent kissing 

1110
01:01:16,091 --> 01:01:16,924
pranks and then he.
And then we agreed that we would do it 

1111
01:01:20,701 --> 01:01:23,620
and he ghosted out on us,
which is fine.

1112
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,840
But then a couple days later he tweeted 
this at me.

1113
01:01:25,841 --> 01:01:28,630
I challenged h three h three productions
to a fight.

1114
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:31,890
If I lose,
I delete my youtube channel and give him

1115
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,010
$100,000.
Well,

1116
01:01:33,011 --> 01:01:33,940
first of all,
Chris,

1117
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:38,320
if you delete your youtube channel,
what the fuck am I going to talk about?

1118
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:42,100
You think I want you to arrange your 
youtube channel.

1119
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:44,410
I'm going to throw the fight on purpose,
man.

1120
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:45,720
We got to lose that gem.
That's the.

1121
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,170
Come on.
That's history,

1122
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:49,080
man.
That's.

1123
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:51,280
So I,
I proposed to him.

1124
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:54,640
How about a quick game for a quick kiss 
instead,

1125
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,900
which is,
you know,

1126
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,700
something I've been proposing to him for
a long time.

1127
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,900
I want him to come in here and 
challenge.

1128
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,810
I gave you approval to him.

1129
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,480
Hmm?
What if he got my number?

1130
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,190
Is that.
Can I get your number?

1131
01:02:10,191 --> 01:02:12,260
I was like,
fuck you got any butter?

1132
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,340
Butter,
garlic sauce.

1133
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:18,650
I have A.
I have an insatiable thirst for calc.

1134
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,210
I keep forgetting what the exact 
phrases.

1135
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,570
So anyway,
this turn into a whole thing.

1136
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:28,980
Ken Bone stuck up for me.
God bless Ken bone.

1137
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:29,814
He said,
I volunteer to serve as tribute in your 

1138
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:32,760
place.
My Papa.

1139
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:36,930
Bless my efforts in the battle to come.
Ken Bone was prank invasion.

1140
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:40,500
I thought that would be interesting.
But he said and prank invasion.

1141
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:41,334
Not to be outdone tweeted,
how about you ask Isla client about my 

1142
01:02:46,381 --> 01:02:50,730
kissing prowess shall tell you all about
all you need to know.

1143
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,500
Now quit reflecting.
Are you going to fight me or run scared,

1144
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,530
Bro.
You look like you disappeared for a year

1145
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:01,650
and you were in prison and you've been 
lifting weights that whole time.

1146
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,080
Like the last video you made.
I was scared.

1147
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:06,240
I was like,
this guy was in prison for a year.

1148
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:07,980
Like you looked jacked,
bro.

1149
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,250
You Look Patrice Wilson jacked.
Do you think I'm insane?

1150
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:14,430
Do you think that's my skill that would 
get in a ring with you and fight you?

1151
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,460
Why don't you fight Patrice Wilson did.

1152
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,990
I mean he,
he's veins were like surgeon.

1153
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:25,523
It's like,
what did you do to be in prison for the 

1154
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:30,820
past two years to be that Jack?
Because he disappeared to.

1155
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:36,210
I always love when we get into this 
Kinda fuse or whatever the word is.

1156
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:39,300
They always try to.
Yeah,

1157
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:41,710
I know.
Take a stab at me cause it's like,

1158
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:42,521
oh,
you're married.

1159
01:03:42,521 --> 01:03:45,700
I'm going to go after your wife.
Did it work?

1160
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:46,870
No.
Well,

1161
01:03:46,871 --> 01:03:48,920
Isla,
I'm asking you now as you directed me.

1162
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,790
What about Chris's pray kissing prowess.

1163
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:58,170
What about it?
Quit deflecting.

1164
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:05,260
Are you going to fight me or run scared?
You fucking dumb ass.

1165
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,930
You're gonna.
Fight me like everybody.

1166
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:13,530
Like if you challenge me to a fight on 
twitter,

1167
01:04:13,531 --> 01:04:18,531
I am duty.
I'm like honor bound Sarah,

1168
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:21,470
I challenge you to a duel.
No Bro.

1169
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,930
Actually fucking work.
I actually do shit everyday.

1170
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,830
I'm not training in prison to fucking 
kill someone.

1171
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,213
And then he continues all these 
youtubers afraid to take me on in the 

1172
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:37,470
ring.
Look at that face.

1173
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:44,010
And then of course is a changed his 
profile description too.

1174
01:04:44,011 --> 01:04:45,930
I am the best kisser in the world.

1175
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,633
Hmm.

1176
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:52,580
Another step into being the main.
Yeah,

1177
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,020
the main,
the main verse.

1178
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:59,280
Kinda like to self aware at that point.
So what I was really hoping for now that

1179
01:04:59,781 --> 01:05:04,160
prank of Adrian has kind of entered this
world of boxing.

1180
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:09,670
I would love so much to put together the
first ever h,

1181
01:05:10,371 --> 01:05:14,810
three podcast,
h three transcendent experience,

1182
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:19,600
special fight night.
And I will put up a $100,000,

1183
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:20,853
100,000
dollars to the winner of prank invasion 

1184
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:25,984
verse.
I don't know who you guys think is the 

1185
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:29,650
best matchup.
Joey Salads shoe.

1186
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,420
Nice.
Ethan Bradbury.

1187
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,090
Maybe what we can do a poll on our,
um,

1188
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,033
itchy podcast handle.
But we will organize event and put up 

1189
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:39,940
100,000
freaking dollars to the winner.

1190
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,120
I will referee it.
Okay.

1191
01:05:43,121 --> 01:05:45,220
I will be there.
We will judge it.

1192
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:48,490
It's going to be an incredible night.
Prank invasion.

1193
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,790
Put your money where your mouth is.
I'm putting up $100,000

1194
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:56,791
for you to fight Joey Salads.

1195
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,610
I wonder what people think.
We should do a poll or something.

1196
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:01,320
Yeah,
we should definitely do a poll.

1197
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:03,660
But that would be a fricken blessed man.
I,

1198
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,440
I,
I,

1199
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,180
we have to do this.
We have to.

1200
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,330
So that's what I was thinking.
What do you guys think?

1201
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,760
Because that sounds like a fun time or 
what?

1202
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:17,350
Be like a fight outside of Mcdonald's.

1203
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:19,991
Dan?
Yeah.

1204
01:06:19,991 --> 01:06:21,670
Throw up a poll.
Let's get a live count on it.

1205
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:22,880
Um,
no.

1206
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:26,230
I want to rent a venue.
I want to publicize it and wants to be a

1207
01:06:26,231 --> 01:06:29,800
big deal,
not a big deal,

1208
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,070
just like an episode.
It's like an episode of the podcast.

1209
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,320
Hopefully I get sponsors that help me 
pay those,

1210
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:41,460
pay the price.
Did the winner gets a kiss from,

1211
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:45,383
um,
maybe we can get that Papa John's 

1212
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,390
sponsorship that I've always been 
looking after.

1213
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,513
Um,
do you want to talk about this Chinese 

1214
01:06:52,681 --> 01:06:54,570
people's story before we move on to the 
shoe?

1215
01:06:54,571 --> 01:06:55,404
Nice story

1216
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,320
and what kind of move on to.
Nice.

1217
01:06:59,130 --> 01:06:59,963
I love this story.
I guess maybe we can talk about it next 

1218
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,520
week.
So good.

1219
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:06,970
Apparently a Chinese company,
a Chinese couple.

1220
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,133
Apparently sex education is so poor in 
China that a couple was trying to 

1221
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:15,400
conceive for four years and they were 
having anal sex the whole time.

1222
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,430
I don't know.
That's possible.

1223
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:22,710
So they were trying to conceive and then
it wasn't working and they went to see a

1224
01:07:22,711 --> 01:07:27,711
doctor and the lady said every time they
have sex it's usually painful.

1225
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:30,780
So she was like,
let me examine you.

1226
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:31,673
Like why is it painful for four years?
And then if it turns out they 

1227
01:07:39,061 --> 01:07:43,860
mistakenly.
I've been having anal intercourse.

1228
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,013
Lou gave the couple a sex education 
handbook and within months the woman 

1229
01:07:49,261 --> 01:07:53,220
became pregnant to show their 
appreciation.

1230
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:57,660
They sent the doctor a live hand and 100
eggs as a gift.

1231
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:02,383
You know,
you think of humans as these really 

1232
01:08:03,261 --> 01:08:04,640
smart,
evolved creatures,

1233
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:05,653
but when you go out to the rural rural 
parts of the world without medicine or 

1234
01:08:09,741 --> 01:08:10,574
doctors or technology available were 
fucking each other's in the ass trying 

1235
01:08:13,311 --> 01:08:17,660
to make ourselves pregnant.
Huh?

1236
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,870
That's interesting.
Yeah.

1237
01:08:20,871 --> 01:08:21,830
Right.
The guy is just like,

1238
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:22,690
yeah,
that's how,

1239
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:28,290
that's how you get pregnant.
That blows my mind.

1240
01:08:31,251 --> 01:08:34,910
The two human beings can have anal sex 
trying to get pregnant.

1241
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:35,744
Like when you're that disconnected from 
technology that that's how that can go 

1242
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:39,254
down.
I'm rally that is pretty rare to be so 

1243
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:45,710
lacking of knowledge,
but it's not uncommon.

1244
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:46,603
And um,
like sexual education and there is not 

1245
01:08:50,721 --> 01:08:54,350
really sensing enough yet.
Yeah.

1246
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:57,860
The big takeaway that was interesting 
for me is that in rural China,

1247
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:02,720
apparently sex education is.
So I'm all,

1248
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,460
I can't vote on it.
That's disappointing.

1249
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,150
I opened the thread,
the pole,

1250
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,940
just just show me the damn results out.

1251
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:15,320
Apparently sex education in China is so 
poor that people are out there having,

1252
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,233
you know,
shooting loads in each other to 

1253
01:09:16,821 --> 01:09:19,490
buttholes trying to shoot out a baby 
literally.

1254
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,130
So now is the story.
So anyway.

1255
01:09:22,131 --> 01:09:23,280
Okay,
we got that out of the way.

1256
01:09:23,281 --> 01:09:27,110
Great.
Let's move on a little shoe and I says a

1257
01:09:27,111 --> 01:09:30,740
fucking lunatic.
And other nodes we mentioned.

1258
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,583
Should I,
so briefly in our last episode so 

1259
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:35,264
briefly and in fact I want to show you 
the video so you can see how brief it 

1260
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:41,294
was,
just so that you can understand the 

1261
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:47,000
reaction he had,
how insane it is.

1262
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:50,070
Okay.
I'm shoe.

1263
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,080
Nice.
Nice.

1264
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,191
Oh,
he's a legend.

1265
01:09:52,191 --> 01:09:56,090
He eats you yoder and chases alcohol.
So he made,

1266
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:03,160
he made a asm art eating chips video.
He just never showed it by the way.

1267
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,520
So that was,
you know,

1268
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:14,510
very light mentioned.
And we went into the comments section,

1269
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:16,263
um,
boy strap up because this is a wild 

1270
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:21,440
fucking ride.
My dudes.

1271
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:23,263
So apparently shooting ice has like 20 
different accounts and he switches 

1272
01:10:27,741 --> 01:10:28,574
between them.
I don't know if he thinks that we don't 

1273
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:33,404
know that it's him because they all have
his name in the title or maybe he 

1274
01:10:35,421 --> 01:10:38,930
switched into other accounts to upvote 
himself,

1275
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,660
but this is a wild ride shoe.
Nice.

1276
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:44,090
First comments.
Thank God bro,

1277
01:10:44,091 --> 01:10:47,300
for another mention.
Wish I could be the hundredth podcast.

1278
01:10:47,301 --> 01:10:48,860
I'll behave.
Love you guys.

1279
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:52,430
Then he replies to himself.
Thank you.

1280
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,350
Didn't log out of the right one.
Then he logs into shoe.

1281
01:10:57,351 --> 01:10:58,400
Nice.
Youtube.

1282
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,900
Thank you.
Thank you.

1283
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:01,603
Then shoe and ice youtube videos.
Let's do this shoe and inspirational 

1284
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:06,734
quote of the day.
Shoe and ice loves isla and wishes she 

1285
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:13,540
would forgive him if you guys don't know
he had called you a

1286
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:19,130
Jewish whore or something.
Start something sweet like that.

1287
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,950
And then boom and ice.
Ghost hunting was shoe.

1288
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:23,784
Nice.
Let's do this at which is the same 

1289
01:11:26,101 --> 01:11:28,440
comment left by shoe.
Nice youtube videos and sit down.

1290
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:32,850
She and I believe it.
Exclamation.

1291
01:11:32,851 --> 01:11:35,850
I believe Ethan is willing to forgive 
shoe.

1292
01:11:35,851 --> 01:11:36,810
Nice bye.
Ha Ha,

1293
01:11:36,811 --> 01:11:40,530
ha ha.
Wish Ethan would pin this.

1294
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:44,220
He continues shoe.
Nice.

1295
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:47,370
Deleted videos to CSU nights would be 
legendary.

1296
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,950
The real issue.
Nice deleted videos.

1297
01:11:49,951 --> 01:11:51,630
Wish upon a star,
Bro.

1298
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:53,490
Wish.
Wish upon a star,

1299
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:56,070
Bro Shoe.
Nice is not dead shoe.

1300
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,090
Nice.
The mental sad man.

1301
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:02,370
Never duplicated.
Give this a thumbs up.

1302
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:05,130
Everyone shoe.
Nice exposed.

1303
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:06,720
I will come to Cali,
bro.

1304
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:07,554
Let me know this.
Are you fucking mind blowing that it's 

1305
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:13,080
taken to do [inaudible]?
Like are you mind blown yet?

1306
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:17,070
Did He created all those channels?
Your thing,

1307
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:19,260
every comment or you think he already 
had?

1308
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:21,330
I think he already had them shoot and I 
says,

1309
01:12:21,331 --> 01:12:22,164
well known for having multiple channels 
and I'm constantly erasing videos and 

1310
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,370
using other accounts.
As I was saying,

1311
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:31,860
he had an Asm,
our video channel for a moment,

1312
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:34,500
so not surprised that he has all these 
accounts.

1313
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:35,543
I am shocked and awed,
frankly the scope of this operation and 

1314
01:12:40,141 --> 01:12:43,320
I will continue just for the sake of 
posterity.

1315
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:45,990
A shoe.
Nice revival.

1316
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:50,820
She I says in revival mode,
a shooting winning channels and I says,

1317
01:12:50,821 --> 01:12:52,100
always went it,
shoot.

1318
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:54,910
Nice deleted video x nine.
Said Yep,

1319
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:59,550
continue a few.
Nice is nice shoe.

1320
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,900
Nice is nice.
Actually.

1321
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,690
Shoe.
Nice impersonation and parodies.

1322
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,673
Mind over matter.
I'm not sure what's the relevance of 

1323
01:13:07,831 --> 01:13:11,010
that one.
That should have been from the shoe.

1324
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,960
Nice inspirational quotes,
right?

1325
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:16,530
Go to mixed up.
She wanted to get your shit together,

1326
01:13:16,531 --> 01:13:17,364
man.
You've got to keep your identities 

1327
01:13:18,151 --> 01:13:18,980
organized.

1328
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:19,451

1347
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:05,663
Mind over matter.
I feel like he's giving himself a prep 

1348
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:10,740
talk because he's on like the 20th 
account.

1349
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:14,530
A nice war hero deleted videos anyone 
knows.

1350

She.
Nice is a war veteran.

01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:19,630
Like Isla Shoe.
Nice impersonations.

1352
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:20,371
Yep.
Shoe.

1353
01:14:20,371 --> 01:14:21,850
Nice free shout outs.
Thank you.

1354
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,380
Shoe.
Nice back.

1355
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:24,214
The original back to finally close it up
with a thank you for replying to that 

1356
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:33,190
was so fucking nuts and you know what's 
even crazier when I saw that,

1357
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:34,480
I was like,
you know what,

1358
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:36,880
if we're talking about whack pack,
Howard Stern,

1359
01:14:36,881 --> 01:14:41,881
whack pack that we want to build our own
shoe and ice is the beetle juice,

1360
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:46,990
and so we would try every.

1361
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:47,973
I've tweeted at him,
I emailed him and this fucking psycho 

1362
01:14:50,891 --> 01:14:53,410
that spent five hours.
We're applying 100 times.

1363
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,980
I can't get ahold of them.
I have no way of getting a hold of him.

1364
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:58,940
So shoe.
Nice.

1365
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:01,510
I've said your name three times in a 
spin in a circle.

1366
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,440
Shoo.
Shoo.

1367
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:06,080
Shoo.
Not Summon,

1368
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:10,900
disappeared back into the comments.
Give us a way to contact you.

1369
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:13,230
I want you to be part of this show shoe 
and I just.

1370
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,073
I think you have what it takes to be the
first official member of the h three 

1371
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:23,101
goof gang gang gangs.
Pretty good or bad?

1372
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,750
Yeah.
We're out here on the fly.

1373
01:15:25,751 --> 01:15:26,584
People Hae a little update.
This poll is neck and neck going back 

1374
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:33,244
and forth.
Ethan Bradbury and Joey Salads both 

1375
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,890
hovering around 42 percent.
Julia was a head a little bit,

1376
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:40,720
but now Ethan,
let me take you this.

1377
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,940
Who Do you think would put up the best 
fight?

1378
01:15:42,941 --> 01:15:47,170
Because let me tell you guys.
Chris from Pre-eq invasion went away for

1379
01:15:47,171 --> 01:15:49,840
some kind of sexual crime and he is 
jacked,

1380
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,610
so who would give up the best fight?
Ethan?

1381
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:59,230
Ethan has a madness.
He's got the fighting spirit for sure,

1382
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:03,390
but I think joey,
I think joey would.

1383
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:07,000
Who would you say is winning right now?
Are Neck and neck.

1384
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:09,310
It really is not kidding.
It keeps going back.

1385
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:11,390
It's actually tied right now.
Nobody cares about shoe.

1386
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,233
Nice,
right?

1387
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:16,120
He's down at 16 and would actually.
And I'm not saying this as a joke,

1388
01:16:16,121 --> 01:16:20,140
I'm saying literally would kill him.
Think that he would die.

1389
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:25,170
She and I in the ring.
I'm joey salads or Ethan Bradbury.

1390
01:16:26,651 --> 01:16:30,220
Who would offer a better fight.
Are you texting during our show you'll.

1391
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,700
I just voted.
Okay.

1392
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:33,323
Who'd you vote for?

1393
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:37,120
I can't say it because not everyone.
That's true.

1394
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:39,280
That's good.
I want to keep it anonymous.

1395
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:42,460
You have a preference because I'm asking
you.

1396
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,560
Well,
you don't want to say it.

1397
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:50,020
I honestly can't say which one I prefer.
I think they're both great candidates.

1398
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:55,400
Got To vote to see the results.
So I think joey might be a little taller

1399
01:16:55,401 --> 01:16:56,234
and a little heavier,
so I think that he might offer the best 

1400
01:17:00,071 --> 01:17:04,000
challenge to.
Right now it's at Ethan Bradbury.

1401
01:17:04,001 --> 01:17:06,520
Forty two percent.
Really?

1402
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,980
It's 43.
Oh good.

1403
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:09,913
I caught,
I think joey cells would be a better 

1404
01:17:11,181 --> 01:17:14,360
candidate and I think joey salads is 
more up for anything.

1405
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,170
So Shana I'm calling out shoe.
Nice.

1406
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,480
Versus just want to contact you?
Um,

1407
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:25,010
yeah.
Joey Salads and prank invasion.

1408
01:17:25,011 --> 01:17:25,844
If you're watching this,
that gotland has been tossed for the h 

1409
01:17:27,761 --> 01:17:31,220
three Trans sensel transcend.
Transcend.

1410
01:17:31,221 --> 01:17:36,221
Joel didn't say thank you.
I'm calling out Joey Salads.

1411
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,230
Prank invasion,
Bradford,

1412
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,860
all three of them in the ring together.

1413
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:50,240
Referral rumble.
Let us transcend together.

1414
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:56,470
Thank you.
Good spiritual sometimes on the show.

1415
01:17:57,370 --> 01:18:00,490
We've got a couple more things to cover 
here folks.

1416
01:18:00,491 --> 01:18:04,600
We've got this story.
Just makes me rock hard.

1417
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:08,860
Let me pull this up.
I don't know if this is too graphic,

1418
01:18:08,861 --> 01:18:12,340
this photo actually on the main page.
I'm probably not.

1419
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,950
Do you want to look at this time 
article?

1420
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:17,880
Do you want it to look peek at this and 
tell me if you think it's too graphic,

1421
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:22,090
but it's fine.
I saw it really little touch.

1422
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:25,750
Maybe not.
I don't want to show it here.

1423
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,640
This one I could show.
I'll show this.

1424
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:32,320
I just won't move up so that.
I don't know if that helps you at all or

1425
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:33,573
not really.

1426
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:36,943
First North American sex doll,
brothel opens and Toronto actually here 

1427
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:44,490
I can click on that.
Picture it and Laura.

1428
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:46,700
I got this.
So what does that mean?

1429
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:50,660
A brothel instead of having human sex 
dolls.

1430
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:55,040
That sound bad set of having humans you 
can have sex with.

1431
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,700
They have sex dolls.
Realistic sex dolls.

1432
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,510
We have a photo of the adults,
don't we?

1433
01:19:00,511 --> 01:19:02,690
Dan?
Yeah.

1434
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:04,920
Where are they?
The dogs.

1435
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:05,773
I've got it.
You got to go.

1436
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:07,573
So if you're wondering,
what I'm talking about here is some of 

1437
01:19:10,071 --> 01:19:10,904
the choices are adult.
So you have a choice of ana who was 

1438
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:20,690
busty as who can play and see huge,
very busty,

1439
01:19:20,691 --> 01:19:21,524
romantic and spontaneous.
I don't not sure how a doll is 

1440
01:19:24,531 --> 01:19:25,370
spontaneous.

1441
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,333
I mean,
I think a doll is pretty much the 

1442
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,090
opposite of spontaneous,
if that's possible.

1443
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:35,910
As predictable as it get.
Erica,

1444
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:40,820
who's a young,
was gorgeous and sweet.

1445
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,330
You've got harper,
the perfect girl.

1446
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:48,890
Next door.
You've got jasmine exotic faced angel.

1447
01:19:48,891 --> 01:19:53,480
That just means she's black.
Exotic paste angel.

1448
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:58,510
Okay guys,
a scarlet the absolute American dream.

1449
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:05,000
Yes.
Nothing more American than butter.

1450
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:07,830
Garlic.
So are we eating John Snyder?

1451
01:20:07,831 --> 01:20:08,820
What?
Nope.

1452
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:10,583
And Yuki submissive.
I think all dogs are by definition 

1453
01:20:15,241 --> 01:20:16,074
submissive.
They literally cannot help but be 

1454
01:20:18,601 --> 01:20:20,130
submissive,
innocent.

1455
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:24,170
Not when I'm done with her.
And playful.

1456
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,590
So this is some.
This is some wild shit.

1457
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:29,424
You guys that we're talking about here.
So you choose what you want to fuck 

1458
01:20:32,821 --> 01:20:33,654
with.
Now their rate and membership thing 

1459
01:20:34,981 --> 01:20:36,290
cracked me up.
Okay.

1460
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:37,803
And I was like,
you could probably fund a real 

1461
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:44,631
prostitute for this price.
So for half an hour you get one doll for

1462
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:49,170
80 bucks and two dolls.
What do you need to dolls?

1463
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:51,810
They're not living.
Imagine taking the boat.

1464
01:20:51,811 --> 01:20:55,490
They're lifeless heads and like how to 
buy your own dog.

1465
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,370
I think those real ones actually are 
like thousands.

1466
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,083
Yeah.

1467
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,770
Do you really need a real one at that 
point?

1468
01:21:04,771 --> 01:21:06,110
It's like Ian said,
uh,

1469
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:08,340
he,
when he was researching at 4,000

1470
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:10,703
really start and really I didn't ask you
[inaudible] wasn't part of our research 

1471
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:19,410
dollars.
I love that.

1472
01:21:19,411 --> 01:21:22,350
You can have a threesome with these 
things in 180.

1473
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,570
No discount.
That's just double the price.

1474
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:28,680
I know I could double the price.
There's a discount.

1475
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,350
You can get them for a half hour.
One,

1476
01:21:31,351 --> 01:21:32,700
two,
three or four hours.

1477
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:35,700
They have a grand opening in like a $10 
off.

1478
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:36,570
Nothing.
What I'm saying,

1479
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:37,530
man,
give me a discount.

1480
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,440
Grand opening.
Twenty five percent off the price.

1481
01:21:40,441 --> 01:21:41,274
Now guys,
you can use your imagination and 

1482
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:43,254
understand that fucking the same fake 
doll as many men before you gets a 

1483
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:50,970
little strange.
I guess it's true of women,

1484
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:53,970
but there are biological creatures.
They shower,

1485
01:21:53,971 --> 01:21:57,090
they walk around,
you know?

1486
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,273
Yeah.
I'll know that fake vagina is going to 

1487
01:22:00,211 --> 01:22:02,250
get blasted out after like a thousand 
times.

1488
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,084
Right.
But I guess you get the mileage out of 

1489
01:22:04,951 --> 01:22:06,310
it after that.
I mean,

1490
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:07,223
dude,
the human body is regenerative as the 

1491
01:22:10,671 --> 01:22:15,671
very beautiful ability of rejuvenating 
itself and healing itself.

1492
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:21,500
But this is not a.
and that is going to get the last it out

1493
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:25,650
wide tongue me after probably 100 times.

1494
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:28,743
So I guess that's how the prices sweet,
innocent Yuki is going to get blasted 

1495
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:39,010
out anyway.
Yeah,

1496
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,090
I guess they,
they,

1497
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:43,870
they calculate that based on the mileage
they expect to get right now.

1498
01:22:43,871 --> 01:22:46,840
Here's a great little twist on this.
Um,

1499
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:51,880
the,
the prostitution association is fighting

1500
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:56,650
back because they're afraid this is 
going to cut into their market.

1501
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,553
Um,
I w I wonder how much it is for real 

1502
01:23:00,671 --> 01:23:01,880
prostitute.
I'd like to see that.

1503
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,950
Their rate card,
it's probably more $80

1504
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:10,270
for half an hour.
And do you have any information on that?

1505
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:16,770
Are you asking Ian specifically calls?
He said so on your own.

1506
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,950
I think 80 would be quite cheap.
I think that would be like a blow job or

1507
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:24,813
something.
I don't think that would be the full 

1508
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:27,130
Monte,
right?

1509
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:28,863
So you save a couple bucks and you fuck 
a doll that had punched his Dick's had 

1510
01:23:31,391 --> 01:23:32,224
been in.
I wonder if they have insatiable hunger 

1511
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:39,460
for coc.
So,

1512
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:40,563
um,
the,

1513
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:45,280
the people who own the dol said,
uh,

1514
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,640
the doll that could grow will be ready 
and waiting in your room.

1515
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:53,290
We do encourage the use of condoms just 
because we don't want people to.

1516
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:54,693
Well,
there's still a chance of getting a 

1517
01:23:55,661 --> 01:23:57,800
sexual disease.
Can you like you like that?

1518
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:02,900
He gave him a fuck up a lifeless doll,
not a condom these days.

1519
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:06,320
Just sanitize the gauges,
clean it,

1520
01:24:06,321 --> 01:24:07,690
man.
I am not.

1521
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:11,470
When they don't want the responsibility.
You've seen that room.

1522
01:24:11,471 --> 01:24:15,510
I trucked often for the sperm test.
Imagine,

1523
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:17,103
imagine it's that.
And then you fuck this doll that other 

1524
01:24:19,901 --> 01:24:20,734
guys.
All bunch of dudes have had their way 

1525
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,700
with,
excuse me.

1526
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:28,720
And then so the prostitution 
association,

1527
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:32,890
the Association of sex professionals 
strikes back.

1528
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:38,910
They set quote the sex affection of a 
person cannot be provided by a doll.

1529
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:46,500
You would say that they are different 
and compatible services.

1530
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:52,060
They do not communicate.
They do not listen to you or Koresh you.

1531
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,073
They do not come for you or look at you.
They do not give you their opinion or 

1532
01:24:56,531 --> 01:24:57,970
drink.
I didn't ask for your opinion.

1533
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:00,123
Sorry.
They do not give you their opinion or 

1534
01:25:02,951 --> 01:25:06,490
drink a glass of champagne with you.
Champagne.

1535
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:09,043
Alright,
sorry.

1536
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:14,970
Whoa.
I didn't ask for A.

1537
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:20,030
I didn't getting all jacked up on.
They do not give.

1538
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:20,983
Thank you Dan.
They do not give you their opinion or 

1539
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:23,624
drink a glass of champagne with you.
One of the members also said it's 

1540
01:25:25,641 --> 01:25:29,810
another strategy of the patriarchy that 
presents us as objects without rights.

1541
01:25:29,811 --> 01:25:31,940
Are souls a privilege of the wealthy 
class.

1542
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,753
That's funny because in a way isn't any 
better for a woman more accessible like 

1543
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:44,330
to let men do whatever they want.
We to an object instead of a person.

1544
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:45,223
Well,
I think that their perspective is that 

1545
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:48,703
it's female empowerment in that you.
You're not telling a woman what she can 

1546
01:25:51,801 --> 01:25:52,634
or cannot do with their body because 
like prostitution is outlawed a lot of 

1547
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:56,684
places and there's a lot of women that 
do want to make their living that way 

1548
01:25:59,511 --> 01:25:59,991
and they say,
Hey,

1549
01:25:59,991 --> 01:26:02,390
don't tell me what to do with my body,
and that's right,

1550
01:26:02,391 --> 01:26:06,170
that's true,
but to throw these sweet,

1551
01:26:06,171 --> 01:26:11,171
innocent submissive dollars under the 
bus is just low at the level below.

1552
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:19,460
They also added,
do you realize that you're fucking adult

1553
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:23,293
where didn't add added up and that's 
really gross and you have to use a 

1554
01:26:25,631 --> 01:26:28,610
condom with that anyway because you can 
get some dudes on your deck.

1555
01:26:32,170 --> 01:26:34,470
That was their best counterpoint.
I was like,

1556
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:35,323
wow,
that's interesting.

1557
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:36,693
They had a video showing how the build 
though those dollars and it looked like 

1558
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:40,663
graphic west orange.
It was basically a direct parody of 

1559
01:26:43,151 --> 01:26:43,984
westworld hits in the fucking vagina and
that like you guys all watched 

1560
01:26:47,801 --> 01:26:49,630
westworld.
It's like this really epic building of a

1561
01:26:49,631 --> 01:26:52,410
clone accepted this.
It's like we're like,

1562
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:53,483
Teddy's get bolted on.
The ask comes up and like some guys 

1563
01:26:56,501 --> 01:26:58,600
dangling with like layby on a fake 
vagina.

1564
01:26:58,601 --> 01:27:00,400
It's like,
that's crazy.

1565
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,360
You saw that clip,
right?

1566
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:05,320
He was dangling it.
Damn Turkey neck.

1567
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:11,080
The westworld songs playing high 
shredder

1568
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:16,820
shredder would fuck the hell out of a 
doggy sex doll.

1569
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:18,683
So horny all the time.
And sometimes we take shutter the dog 

1570
01:27:20,871 --> 01:27:24,260
park and he,
he's a little Romeo man.

1571
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:26,690
He fucks any trouble maker.
We have to,

1572
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:30,380
we have to strap him up because he just 
fucking everyone at everything.

1573
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:32,203
Oh,
he's eating.

1574
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:33,830
Give you.
Let me give you guys a.

1575
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,410
I plan better boys shredder.
Eat some,

1576
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:39,303
eat some food.
I'll take it a dog park to fuck a small 

1577
01:27:44,391 --> 01:27:45,224
update real quick.
We're up to 3000 votes on the pole and 

1578
01:27:47,451 --> 01:27:49,850
joey is pulling ahead.
Oh,

1579
01:27:49,851 --> 01:27:52,130
interesting.
Is that 45 percent to Ethan?

1580
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,930
Bradbury's 40.
So Jan,

1581
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:55,450
can you reach out?
Um,

1582
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:56,533
now.
So you said that I feel like I can 

1583
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,980
reveal my vote.
Was it was,

1584
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,440
it was Ethan Bradbury.
What's important to that?

1585
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:04,573
Just because it was so crazy.
He has the wild eyes such as what are 

1586
01:28:08,631 --> 01:28:09,464
you talking about?

1587
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:12,740
Blackie Wacko.
Every man rumble.

1588
01:28:12,741 --> 01:28:14,610
Fuck the rules.
Like a free for all.

1589
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:15,943
I think that's what we got to do.
We can try to blow up like a serious 

1590
01:28:18,741 --> 01:28:22,330
event now.
I would love to see a four man rumble.

1591
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:25,010
Nice.
He would fucking kill them all.

1592
01:28:25,011 --> 01:28:30,011
He'd be so psycho psycho.
So anyway,

1593
01:28:31,221 --> 01:28:32,170
Dan,
get a ahold.

1594
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:33,043
Can you get ahold of I'm joey,
Ethan and Prank invasion and see if any 

1595
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:39,410
of them are actually interested.
100,000

1596
01:28:39,411 --> 01:28:41,150
bucks.
I'm putting the price up.

1597
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:45,420
It's very generous of you.
I see what you're right.

1598
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,420
I pray that we can get sponsors because 
that's a lot of fucking cheddar cheese.

1599
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:52,830
If we.
God

1600
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:58,890
there's some sponsors out there that 
they'll do it for 5,000.

1601
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,940
I changed the price.
5,000.

1602
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:11,570
Could we negotiable.
There's gotta be some sterile shares and

1603
01:29:12,351 --> 01:29:13,184
the follows.
So tell him there's some minute for 

1604
01:29:16,081 --> 01:29:17,700
them.
We just haven't decided yet.

1605
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:21,860
No,
we just got Paul Harris.

1606
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,240
Got Them.
Um,

1607
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:29,510
how long have you been going?
Because I have a couple more stories.

1608
01:29:29,511 --> 01:29:31,370
You get to hour and a half.
Okay.

1609
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:35,340
Let's through John Mccain and American 
hero.

1610
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,233
What better to follow up our story on 
fucking dolls blasted open two for the 

1611
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:44,580
price of $1.
Just kidding.

1612
01:29:44,581 --> 01:29:47,070
There's no discounts.
John Mccain,

1613
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:50,730
American here.
A great segue.

1614
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:52,440
John Mccain.
Now,

1615
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,950
as you guys probably heard who recently 
passed,

1616
01:29:57,570 --> 01:29:58,403
um,
I think we had recently discussed John 

1617
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:01,613
Mccain for this,
what I consider and what I cherish as 

1618
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:10,320
one of the classiest moments in American
history,

1619
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:13,110
recent American history.
Because as you know,

1620
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:15,150
the country is so politically divided.

1621
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:17,430
It bothers me.
It bothers most people frankly.

1622
01:30:17,431 --> 01:30:18,264
I mean there's a lot of people did drink
the Koolaid on either side and it's 

1623
01:30:22,081 --> 01:30:22,914
really cut.
Like who watches CNN everyday and who 

1624
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:28,170
watches Fox News every day.
That's your team line.

1625
01:30:28,171 --> 01:30:29,004
Okay.
Now John Mccain was a conservative 

1626
01:30:30,811 --> 01:30:34,560
through and through.
He was a Fox News man and the people,

1627
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:39,030
a lot of people that,
that Bruno didn't like Obama.

1628
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:41,490
There was a lot of weird conspiracy 
theories about him.

1629
01:30:41,491 --> 01:30:43,950
One of which perpetrated,
by the way,

1630
01:30:43,951 --> 01:30:47,340
of our current president,
which is probably the dumbest.

1631
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:48,263
I mean,
there's a lot of things to say about 

1632
01:30:48,931 --> 01:30:50,430
trump.
I'm not going to get into it,

1633
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:51,563
but accusing Obama of not being an 
American citizen and is probably the 

1634
01:30:55,801 --> 01:30:56,634
dumbest and the most insidious,
flat out insane lie I've ever heard of 

1635
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:02,110
in my life.
All right,

1636
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:07,350
so a lot of the people bought into that 
and one of the women at the rally,

1637
01:31:07,351 --> 01:31:08,184
a lot of it's happened several times 
actually a couple of times where they 

1638
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:12,240
say who Obama is.

1639
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,073
An Arab obviously implying a lot more.
Not implying that Arabs can't be good 

1640
01:31:18,481 --> 01:31:19,314
people,
but John Mccain read between the lines 

1641
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:26,430
being you'll see for yourself,
but basically this one,

1642
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:27,743
the classiest moment in my opinion in 
recent American history where he went 

1643
01:31:32,581 --> 01:31:36,180
against the grain.
He risked his own ass.

1644
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:38,260
He's in,
you know,

1645
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:41,720
a town hall meeting with these people 
that are thirsty,

1646
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:42,573
bloodthirsty,
and he just fucking stopped him in his 

1647
01:31:44,461 --> 01:31:45,390
tracks.
He said no,

1648
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:46,343
and he knew even gets booed.
They fucking turned on him for actually 

1649
01:31:50,761 --> 01:31:52,760
standing up for his values and,
and,

1650
01:31:52,761 --> 01:31:54,110
and,
and speaking some,

1651
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:58,350
some sanity and the part that really 
pisses me off.

1652
01:31:58,351 --> 01:31:59,470
Well,
let me show you the clip,

1653
01:31:59,471 --> 01:32:00,304
but actually now that this fucking class
act and true American hero has passed 

1654
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:06,183
on,

1655
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,870
you know,
the people

1656
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:12,013
on the left who I politically are 
supposed to be my political allies 

1657
01:32:15,291 --> 01:32:17,570
because I am very left.
I'm a very liberal person.

1658
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:23,530
Say that all the time are eviscerating 
John Mccain for this clip to people that

1659
01:32:26,031 --> 01:32:29,630
he's reaching out to across the bridge.
Yes,

1660
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,401
because.
Well,

1661
01:32:31,401 --> 01:32:32,980
Lemme let's watch the video.
Yeah,

1662
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:36,770
I mean it's just so sad and it's so 
fucking sad.

1663
01:32:36,771 --> 01:32:37,604
Let me play you this.

1664
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,090
Frankly,
we're,

1665
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:44,200
we're scared.
We're scared of an Obama presidency.

1666
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:48,573
First of all,
I want to be present United States and 

1667
01:32:51,491 --> 01:32:53,800
obviously I do not want central Obama to
be,

1668
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:56,890
but I have to tell you,
I have to tell you,

1669
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:57,833
he is a decent person and a person that 
you do not have to be scared as the 

1670
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:04,983
United States.
Now I hear them turn on him and I just 

1671
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:11,560
now look,
if I didn't think I wouldn't be one heck

1672
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:13,720
of a lot better president,
I wouldn't be running.

1673
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:15,400
Okay,
and that's the point.

1674
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:16,413
That's excellent.

1675
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:20,600
Can hear the crowds turn on him when he 
there to insinuate he's a decent guy.

1676
01:33:20,601 --> 01:33:23,000
You don't have to be scared of.
I mean,

1677
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:26,480
how messed up is our country that,
that simple insinuation,

1678
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:29,810
he is not the antichrist.
You don't have to be scared of him.

1679
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,460
He,
he's a good person.

1680
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:35,170
I can't believe he said that.
You know?

1681
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,393
Yeah.
The second part is the part that people 

1682
01:33:40,711 --> 01:33:41,550
are outraged about.

1683
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:46,610
To the point.
I'm going to ask you a question.

1684
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:47,500
I don't know.

1685
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:50,420
This lady is fucking right.
Yeah.

1686
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:51,700
Look at her hair,
man.

1687
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:55,060
This lady's.
She's Got Fox and he was pumping through

1688
01:33:55,061 --> 01:33:59,020
our veins.
These fellows don't run.

1689
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:02,540
No.
Really her.

1690
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,190
These colors don't run at all.

1691
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:09,730
Well even I can't trust Obama.
I had read about him and he's not.

1692
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:11,290
He's not.
He's a,

1693
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:14,940
he's an Arab.
He is not.

1694
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:16,980
No,
no,

1695
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:18,390
no,
no ma'am.

1696
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,620
She's like,
no ma'am.

1697
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:21,510
What do I say?
Tell me what to think.

1698
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:23,580
Tell me what the thing.
No,

1699
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:25,573
he's a decent family man.
Citizen that I just happened to have 

1700
01:34:28,521 --> 01:34:29,354
disagreements with on fundamental issues
and that's what this campaign is all 

1701
01:34:33,291 --> 01:34:35,360
about.
He's not okay.

1702
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:41,520
He was just saying stuff with this like,
don't even go there with those arguments

1703
01:34:41,521 --> 01:34:44,700
as nonsense.
Exactly,

1704
01:34:45,210 --> 01:34:48,150
and so here's the kind of tweet that 
I've been seeing online.

1705
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:50,640
I'm going to show you one example of 
many people,

1706
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:55,260
many of supposedly enlightened people.
Okay,

1707
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:56,303
look at this.
Fucking stop with the story about how 

1708
01:34:58,971 --> 01:34:59,804
John Mccain shut down a race,
set a rally by saying Barack Obama was 

1709
01:35:02,631 --> 01:35:05,300
an Arab,
but a decent family man as citizen.

1710
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,373
You can be Arab and an American citizen.
You can be Arab and a decent family 

1711
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:11,390
person.
These are not opposed.

1712
01:35:11,391 --> 01:35:13,340
The story perpetuate racism,
Bro.

1713
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:14,263
You perpetuate racism.
You're perpetuating this great divide 

1714
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,700
and you are willfully.
I mean,

1715
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:23,000
you either didn't watch the same clip I 
did.

1716
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:24,410
I mean,
dude,

1717
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:28,140
that's not what he said.
Like he's the,

1718
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,053
the what's,
what really makes me sad as he's 

1719
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:31,244
reaching out to these people,
he's putting his ass on the line to 

1720
01:35:34,101 --> 01:35:34,934
cross to make a bridge of,
of class and dignity that doesn't seem 

1721
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:40,310
to be alive,
left honestly anymore.

1722
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:44,120
Politics and say,
you know what it was saying,

1723
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:48,140
it's a good men like if I'm going to 
lose and he's going to be the president,

1724
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:50,870
you guys don't have to worry,
we disagree,

1725
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:53,630
but you'll have a good guy.
This,

1726
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:56,330
this is so sad to me.
It's great and people are,

1727
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,910
are politicizing this,
trying to be submerged in when,

1728
01:35:58,970 --> 01:35:59,803
when his intention and the purpose of 
what he did was the exact opposite of 

1729
01:36:03,681 --> 01:36:05,690
what they're trying to say after his 
death.

1730
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:07,213
She said he's an Arab,
but her insinuation was so much more 

1731
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:10,970
that,
and he said,

1732
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:12,170
what he's saying is,
no,

1733
01:36:12,171 --> 01:36:13,280
he's not an Arab.
He's saying,

1734
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:15,530
no ma'am,
don't even go there.

1735
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:18,380
Wherever it is that you're trying to 
say.

1736
01:36:18,381 --> 01:36:20,120
Yeah.
Also,

1737
01:36:20,121 --> 01:36:22,220
he's going off the cuff.
It's a live event.

1738
01:36:22,221 --> 01:36:22,830
He's,
yeah,

1739
01:36:22,830 --> 01:36:26,480
he's in the hole with all these people 
ready to turn on him.

1740
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,130
He's making a risk.
They're like,

1741
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:31,040
well,
actually I just want to clarify that.

1742
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:33,710
Um,
Arabs can be good people.

1743
01:36:33,711 --> 01:36:36,530
He is not an era,
but Arabs can be good people.

1744
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:38,090
It's like,
dude,

1745
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:43,120
he shut her down.
I don't know.

1746
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:44,504
I'm so.
I'm so sick of fucking people like this 

1747
01:36:47,931 --> 01:36:50,900
dude.
He could look at this other tweet.

1748
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:53,540
Someone responds to him.
The same guy says,

1749
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:54,613
I hope.
I hope you actually take to heart the 

1750
01:36:56,511 --> 01:36:58,520
idea of reading tweets without your own 
tweet,

1751
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:00,260
from the hip assumptions getting the 
way.

1752
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,720
I clearly said the story was racist.

1753
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:09,190
This is the guy,
by the way.

1754
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:12,860
I don't want to show them.
I'm not talking about the guy,

1755
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:16,300
whatever,
but I'm just like,

1756
01:37:16,301 --> 01:37:17,050
man,
this dude.

1757
01:37:17,050 --> 01:37:17,883
It's not even about him.
I've seen this sentiment echoed a lot 

1758
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:25,510
and I just think it's,
it's a fucking shame.

1759
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:29,750
Like we should be honoring this like a 
really courageous moment of,

1760
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,110
of.
I thought it was really nice of him when

1761
01:37:32,111 --> 01:37:37,111
I saw it courageous and rest in peace to
John Mccain,

1762
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:38,284
the last honest vestige of class.
And how can a guy like that even be 

1763
01:37:42,191 --> 01:37:43,024
classy when the people he's trying to 
reach out to our viscera rating because 

1764
01:37:45,701 --> 01:37:49,540
it's never enough.
I don't know,

1765
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:51,580
man.
That made me really sad.

1766
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:56,730
But I think John Mckinsey and awesome 
dude.

1767
01:37:56,731 --> 01:37:57,564
And,
uh,

1768
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:00,993
he said,
he said in his final statement that he 

1769
01:38:02,441 --> 01:38:04,780
just wants to remember it as someone 
that served his country.

1770
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:08,290
So he definitely will be remembered as 
that.

1771
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:15,950
Hmm Rep

1772
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:22,730
and the words feel Tony from last night.
All right,

1773
01:38:23,450 --> 01:38:24,283
let's move it on to this footage I have 
to share with you guys is one of the 

1774
01:38:28,101 --> 01:38:32,720
most intense and insane things I've ever
freaking seen in my life.

1775
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:35,930
Um,
you guys probably heard,

1776
01:38:35,931 --> 01:38:36,764
we covered a lot of the fires last year 
that were ravaging Ventura and Santa 

1777
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:42,920
Barbara.
There was a fire and nor cal or.

1778
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,193
Yeah,
I think it was in north cal that was 

1779
01:38:45,291 --> 01:38:50,291
even bigger than last year.
Gen savaging and destroying the state.

1780
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:52,723
So on continues.
So this father and son were out hiking 

1781
01:38:57,110 --> 01:38:57,943
and it was all clear.
It was all good and they saw smoke in 

1782
01:38:59,931 --> 01:39:04,931
the distance and didn't think anything 
of it because it was pretty far away.

1783
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:06,463
But the winds picked up and this fire 
started spreading super fast and all of 

1784
01:39:09,831 --> 01:39:11,630
a sudden they're like,
we got get out.

1785
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:12,980
We should,
we should get outta here.

1786
01:39:14,330 --> 01:39:19,330
And so here is their attempt to escape 
this forest.

1787
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:24,710
They were just on a hike.
And this video is just,

1788
01:39:24,890 --> 01:39:25,723
I mean,
it's one of the craziest things I've 

1789
01:39:27,201 --> 01:39:29,430
ever seen,
um,

1790
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:35,720
to 70 year old dad and a son.
And that jeep escaping the forest.

1791
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:51,010
Do I go here in a minute?
I think we can drive through this.

1792
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:00,863
So for those of you that can't see,
they're driving down a narrow forced 

1793
01:40:04,441 --> 01:40:09,441
path and fires raging pretty much on all
sides of them.

1794
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:15,390
Really intense forest fire is insane.
Trees falling over.

1795
01:40:21,290 --> 01:40:23,700
Slow down.
Slow down.

1796
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:29,200
It was like a movie.
Yeah.

1797
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:31,500
It doesn't feel real.
So they got,

1798
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:32,363
they think they're out.
The fires Kinda cleared without the dad 

1799
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:41,034
said we're out.
And then they turn a corner and it's 

1800
01:40:42,421 --> 01:40:46,290
like the craziest hellscape I can 
imagine.

1801
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:51,800
Just fire everywhere.
Fires raging over the road or

1802
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,590
driving through it.
Literally driving through fire.

1803
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:59,340
Can't see.
Just go easy.

1804
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:02,470
Now the car is heating up.
It's going to explode.

1805
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,250
Jesus.
God,

1806
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:10,260
help us.
Carry on so we can see Joe's one.

1807
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:17,540
If a tree falls on us,
please go out and help us get.

1808
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:26,510
Nope,
stop.

1809
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:32,770
Stop you gotta get out of here.
So they reached

1810
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:37,630
a log in the road that was,
that was covering the road.

1811
01:41:37,631 --> 01:41:38,464
It was on fire and it stops.
There were just like the craziest 

1812
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:42,730
cliffhanger of all.
Can't write it.

1813
01:41:42,731 --> 01:41:44,650
Even in the movies that much of a 
cliffhanger.

1814
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:47,380
You know what I've got?
I know how the story ends.

1815
01:41:47,381 --> 01:41:48,340
I'm gonna.
Read it to you guys there.

1816
01:41:48,341 --> 01:41:50,810
Okay.
Does that shredder there?

1817
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:51,920
Okay.
Um,

1818
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,313
I find it interesting because that guy 
who's driving is like forties and the 

1819
01:41:56,051 --> 01:41:56,884
data is 70.
And like in this life threatening 

1820
01:41:58,270 --> 01:41:59,103
situation,
how they like to evolve kind of back to 

1821
01:42:01,751 --> 01:42:05,590
like a little child.
Yeah.

1822
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:08,643
So these fucking lunatics,
they kick it into reverse and backed up 

1823
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:14,223
through that real road,
back through there in reverse and made 

1824
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:20,290
it out.
That's so crazy.

1825
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:22,300
An excerpt of them explaining what 
happened.

1826
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,333
That's when things went bad to worse.
That tree ravaged by the intense fire 

1827
01:42:26,711 --> 01:42:29,110
had fallen down across the road,
blocking their escape route.

1828
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:31,270
I saw that and I thought we were going 
to die.

1829
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:33,160
Justin said,
I thought we were trapped.

1830
01:42:33,161 --> 01:42:36,730
There was no way we could turn around on
the road with his father's guidance just

1831
01:42:36,731 --> 01:42:37,564
in kick the car into reverse and drove 
the vehicle all the way back to the 

1832
01:42:39,911 --> 01:42:41,860
trail head at the end of the road.
At times.

1833
01:42:41,861 --> 01:42:45,940
Justin said he was going as fast as 40 
miles per hour was absolutely insane.

1834
01:42:45,941 --> 01:42:47,950
I don't know how I was able to keep the 
car on the road.

1835
01:42:47,951 --> 01:42:48,784
He said,
but somehow a few prayers in a higher 

1836
01:42:50,141 --> 01:42:50,974
power.
We stayed on the road once they were 

1837
01:42:52,691 --> 01:42:53,524
back at the trail head,
which was safe from the fire for the 

1838
01:42:55,451 --> 01:42:56,284
time being.
They walked down towards a nearby 

1839
01:42:57,971 --> 01:42:59,410
cabinets.
You if anyone could help them.

1840
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:00,483
That's when they saw a small boat 
floating on Lake Mcdonald with two 

1841
01:43:03,191 --> 01:43:04,024
people aboard.
We flagged them down and they came over 

1842
01:43:05,741 --> 01:43:06,574
and grabbed us and we got onto the boat.
Justin said 10 minutes later we were on 

1843
01:43:09,821 --> 01:43:12,970
the water and we saw the whole part of 
the lecture where we had been standing.

1844
01:43:12,971 --> 01:43:15,790
Just go up in flames.
Crazy.

1845
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:18,950
Don.
Unbelievable.

1846
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:21,550
Gape is like,
I was just.

1847
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:26,410
I was mind blown and I watched it.
I'm so happy that they didn't know I had

1848
01:43:26,411 --> 01:43:28,550
to.
When you first showed me the video,

1849
01:43:28,551 --> 01:43:29,384
I was like,
you gotta tell me that they made it 

1850
01:43:31,490 --> 01:43:36,490
because the thing is that you can't like
appreciate is how hot it must've been.

1851
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:40,720
And driving like this road to drive in 
reverse.

1852
01:43:40,830 --> 01:43:44,740
It's got unbelievable.
Jesus definitely took the wheel.

1853
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:50,650
His words.
Anyway,

1854
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:54,260
I just to share that little incredible 
thing I saw with you guys.

1855
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:59,000
Um,
we've got California law makers,

1856
01:43:59,001 --> 01:44:03,980
past bill to erase old poc convictions.
The state a district,

1857
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:09,560
uh,
the doj with the fuck is that department

1858
01:44:09,681 --> 01:44:12,080
of Justice that bless it out.
He's calmed down.

1859
01:44:12,081 --> 01:44:13,880
Sorry.
It's my fault.

1860
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:18,830
A Department of Justice estimates that 
almost 220,000

1861
01:44:18,831 --> 01:44:23,060
cases are eligible for a ratio or 
reduction.

1862
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:27,740
They better pass that you cannot make it
legal and then be like,

1863
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:29,720
oh,
everyone rotting in prison.

1864
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:35,270
Each shit too bad.
Imagine being in prison for 10 years for

1865
01:44:35,271 --> 01:44:36,104
pot.
And then they make it legal and they're 

1866
01:44:37,101 --> 01:44:37,461
like,
okay,

1867
01:44:37,461 --> 01:44:38,720
you can come out now.
It's like,

1868
01:44:38,721 --> 01:44:43,721
fuck anyone who's in jail for president 
in this supposed land of freedom.

1869
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:48,523
Can you imagine like,
I mean anyone could go to jail for 

1870
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,540
having marijuana.
It's in your light,

1871
01:44:53,541 --> 01:44:56,360
like a bright young mind getting wasted 
in prison.

1872
01:44:56,361 --> 01:44:59,990
I fucking our law,
our prison system is the most,

1873
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:05,040
I think barbaric thing about this 
country almost really by far and so man,

1874
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:07,180
everyone,
every one of those 2:20

1875
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:08,023
people should be handed a joint two 
hundred and twenty thousand two hundred 

1876
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:14,090
twenty thousand people should be handed 
a fat blunt,

1877
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,230
100,000
dollars,

1878
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:22,730
hundred thousand dollars because it's a 
lot of people.

1879
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:27,710
They deserve more box in my thing and 
I'll put up a prize,

1880
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:29,473
but they should all be offered a fat 
blunt and a sincere apology from the 

1881
01:45:32,661 --> 01:45:33,494
state of California.
I mean that is just a goddamn crying 

1882
01:45:38,661 --> 01:45:43,661
shame.
It's unbelievable.

1883
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:47,250
I don't think any.
I think that drugs should be legal.

1884
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:50,280
I think all drugs should be illegal.
Personally,

1885
01:45:50,281 --> 01:45:51,114
I don't think what good does it do?
Society locking somebody with a drug 

1886
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:59,670
issue up in prison.
I'll tell what good it does.

1887
01:45:59,671 --> 01:46:02,580
Society,
it creates a system of slavery,

1888
01:46:02,581 --> 01:46:03,540
of Free Labor.

1889
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:05,503
Hm.

1890
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:07,040
In prison.
Yeah,

1891
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:11,780
and it makes a bunch of people that are 
privately owned prisons.

1892
01:46:11,781 --> 01:46:13,970
A bunch of money.
So sick.

1893
01:46:16,730 --> 01:46:18,430
It's.
It shouldn't be private.

1894
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:22,120
That's that.
I know something as prison.

1895
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:25,030
Yeah.
You want to monetize a locking people up

1896
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:32,100
almost as sick as privatizing healthcare
almost.

1897
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,280
Oh Man,
you're dying of cancer.

1898
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:37,170
Well,
if you can't,

1899
01:46:37,171 --> 01:46:40,740
I mean the treatments of million bucks.
Do you have a million bucks?

1900
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:42,810
I guess you're just gonna have to die 
then.

1901
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:48,780
Oh,
you're the richest country of all time.

1902
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,180
Well,
go to prison.

1903
01:46:51,181 --> 01:46:53,400
They have a great health care.
You just don't get paid.

1904
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:55,020
You're basically a slave,
but we will.

1905
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:57,750
I wonder if you get cancer treatment in 
prison probably.

1906
01:46:58,290 --> 01:46:59,910
Hmm.
That's a good question.

1907
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,580
I think you do.
I think.

1908
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,680
I think you do.
I think that that is true.

1909
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:05,573
Yeah.
I think you get hooks on somehow the 

1910
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:08,334
conditions in prison or I guess you have
to make a choice between freedom and 

1911
01:47:11,401 --> 01:47:12,270
dying of cancer.

1912
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:13,763
Hmm.

1913
01:47:14,810 --> 01:47:19,810
They love that.
And finally I'm Ethan.

1914
01:47:20,511 --> 01:47:22,040
You're such a socialist.
Fuck you.

1915
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:25,070
Not a.
So I'm a capitalist.

1916
01:47:25,071 --> 01:47:26,090
Socialist.
Okay.

1917
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:29,000
Let's be realistic.
I'm not talking about communism.

1918
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:31,670
Look at Scandinavia.
I love how people always like,

1919
01:47:31,671 --> 01:47:33,290
socialism doesn't work,
idiot.

1920
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,560
How are you going to pay for it?
Let's go space force.

1921
01:47:36,710 --> 01:47:39,410
Let's give rich people fucking 
$10,000,000,000,000

1922
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:41,610
tax cut.
How are you going to pay for healthcare,

1923
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:46,730
healthcare?
Everyone else in the word sound like you

1924
01:47:46,731 --> 01:47:49,030
sound like a socialist.
Isla Israel.

1925
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:54,050
Configure it on Israel.
Where did they ever agree on anything?

1926
01:47:54,591 --> 01:47:55,424
They don't agree about anything and they
all care about money and somehow they 

1927
01:47:57,801 --> 01:47:58,634
all figured it out and you.
Everyone has healthcare and it's pretty 

1928
01:48:03,111 --> 01:48:06,980
much free Scandinavia.
They always say socialism doesn't work.

1929
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:07,940
Scandinavia

1930
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,710
for university,
free healthcare.

1931
01:48:11,010 --> 01:48:12,810
Utopia.
Everyone's happy.

1932
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:15,190
Great quality of life.
They're not okay.

1933
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:16,980
Yeah,
it's a capitalistic country.

1934
01:48:16,981 --> 01:48:19,650
I'm not talking about communism.
You fucking idiot.

1935
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:22,620
Be Realistic with what I'm saying.

1936
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,990
Just don't want to go bankrupt over 
getting sick.

1937
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:34,200
You sound like a 30 socialistic scumbag.
Now.

1938
01:48:34,421 --> 01:48:35,254
Can I lock you up and give you some 
cancer treatment in exchange for your 

1939
01:48:39,101 --> 01:48:39,934
life?
Get a little political here for a 

1940
01:48:43,661 --> 01:48:44,494
minute.

1941
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:51,823
We just found out it's been one year 
since our lawsuit ended and I can't 

1942
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:59,210
believe it's not been longer.
I cannot believe kind of explains when I

1943
01:48:59,211 --> 01:49:04,211
look back that our lawsuit is ended only
one year ago explains how fucked up I've

1944
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:07,700
been mentally.
We've moved twice in that time.

1945
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:08,923
We were in this gut wrenching lawsuit.
Your Dad has been sick this whole time 

1946
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:14,143
and I've just been like,
it's such a mental fuck this whole time 

1947
01:49:16,821 --> 01:49:19,580
and like you,
it's hard to look from the outside,

1948
01:49:19,581 --> 01:49:21,770
but like damn,
it's been a crazy.

1949
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:25,220
It's been a crazy time.
It's been a crazy year.

1950
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:30,980
I've heard a lot of people say that 2017
was the worst year.

1951
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:34,480
Seems like a New Year's.
Everyone's always like,

1952
01:49:34,510 --> 01:49:36,050
this is going to be my year.
No,

1953
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:38,650
it's not guaranteed.
It's not.

1954
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,270
Anyway,
I thought this was cute or alert.

1955
01:49:43,330 --> 01:49:46,000
Our attorney that did most of the work 
on our case.

1956
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,033
He sent me this picture of his office.
He's got this t shirt hung on the wall 

1957
01:49:52,301 --> 01:49:54,730
of his office,
the matter of law shirt

1958
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,450
that we made that one and I was like,
man,

1959
01:49:57,451 --> 01:50:00,440
that's cool.
That's really cool.

1960
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:01,333
It's a trophy as he put it.
I appreciated that and I thank you guys 

1961
01:50:05,781 --> 01:50:08,540
all for hanging around.
It's been a tough year for us and uh,

1962
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:10,693
you guys hanging around and Karen about 
what we're talking about and what we're 

1963
01:50:13,581 --> 01:50:15,440
going through.
It sure means a lot to us.

1964
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:20,660
Not Been My best over this past year.
I would say that I don't think so.

1965
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:24,170
I felt like it.
What is your best anyway?

1966
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:28,070
I felt like Shit,
you know,

1967
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:30,590
I made a jacket that says I feel like 
shit.

1968
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:35,440
It's no secret there.
A lot of people related.

1969
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:39,530
What do we do about that?
Why we all feel like shit.

1970
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:44,650
What are we going to do about that?
That was great.

1971
01:50:46,970 --> 01:50:50,300
Dan was at you maybe?
Yes.

1972
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:56,293
One last update on the pool.
I think we've got a clear winner with 

1973
01:50:58,371 --> 01:51:00,690
Joey Salads at 44 percent.
1,000

1974
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:01,573
votes in

1975
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:04,970
going on buddy.
So

1976
01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:06,070
reach out to them.
Would you?

1977
01:51:06,071 --> 01:51:07,030
Dan?
Will do.

1978
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:08,530
Okay,
let's set this up.

1979
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:12,760
I'm excited guys.
Fuck you.

1980
01:51:13,330 --> 01:51:15,770
Fuck all the pranksters would want to.
Well,

1981
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:16,633
we can have like a tournament bracket.
It's like a prankster and turned them 

1982
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:19,690
into whole bracket.
Man.

1983
01:51:19,691 --> 01:51:20,524
I don't give a shit,
I kinda liked the idea of like 

1984
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:24,103
untrained.
Just get in there and throw some 

1985
01:51:26,051 --> 01:51:27,820
punches.
I don't mean to make.

1986
01:51:27,821 --> 01:51:30,300
No one is allowed to train.
Yeah,

1987
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:33,880
no big deal.
We're just going to let the rain come.

1988
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:36,370
Shoot and ice is the Guardian.
He's the boss.

1989
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:42,990
She and I still going to eat a stick of 
deodorant before he takes you on guys.

1990
01:51:43,661 --> 01:51:44,494
Thank you for watching.
This has been another correct opinion 

1991
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:50,163
zone h three Tuesday episode.
Hope you are enjoying these Tuesday 

1992
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:56,830
episodes.
I have no plan on stopping because a lot

1993
01:51:56,831 --> 01:51:57,664
of people don't know what to think about
things and if you need to know what to 

1994
01:52:01,091 --> 01:52:02,740
think,
how to feel my friends,

1995
01:52:02,741 --> 01:52:05,830
it's Tuesday.
We are fully enlightened and when you're

1996
01:52:05,831 --> 01:52:08,650
in the correct opinion,
his own you cannot be wrong.

1997
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:12,550
Friday is Tim.
Hi Decker.

1998
01:52:12,551 --> 01:52:16,850
The comedy,
a legend,

1999
01:52:17,050 --> 01:52:18,970
a pioneer.
God legend.

2000
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:24,090
I would say God,
I'm both nervous and excited to make his

2001
01:52:24,611 --> 01:52:26,860
acquaintance because as many of you 
know,

2002
01:52:26,861 --> 01:52:27,694
he is a.
I have said that he is the sole reason 

2003
01:52:32,201 --> 01:52:33,640
I've made comedy.
Yeah,

2004
01:52:33,641 --> 01:52:34,474
I think most of our listeners know that,
so I think everyone is probably feeling 

2005
01:52:38,561 --> 01:52:43,560
you're like dread site man.
Um,

2006
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:46,250
why can't I just be like,
why can't I just

2007
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:50,780
be happily excited?
I feel like that's normal to be like,

2008
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:55,350
I'm going to meet one of my heroes.
I don't know.

2009
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:00,520
Why do I have to offer?
You're actually excited about stuff like

2010
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:04,760
positively excited.
Why do I have to suffer?

2011
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:08,870
It's a good thing.
Why do I have to suffer?

2012
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:11,810
Either jumped out at me.
He's like,

2013
01:53:11,811 --> 01:53:12,621

Yeah,

2014
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:14,960
we're done.
Thank you everyone.

2017
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,760
That was a lot of fun.
It's on youtube.

2018
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:24,290
Just type killed Tony World.
We did it.

2019
01:53:24,291 --> 01:53:26,150
I was great.
Great show.

2020
01:53:26,330 --> 01:53:31,330
And you can degrade.
I didn't say a word that starts shtick.

2021
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:37,160
I was really nervous though.
I was fucking so nervous again.

2022
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:40,760
Why do I have to suffer?
I was excited to be there.

2023
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:42,800
I love their show.
I liked them.

2024
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,540
So why do I have to suffer?

2025
01:53:46,190 --> 01:53:47,023
Hmm.

2026
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:53,240
That's a question for another time.
Why we transcend,

2027
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:55,390
we think deeply

2028
01:53:56,660 --> 01:53:57,493
experience.

2029
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:05,640
We shall see you on Friday on the h
