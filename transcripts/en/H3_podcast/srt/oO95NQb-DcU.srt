1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,730
Well,

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,330

We're back on this blessing,

00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,250

5
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,470
here today.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,470
honey express vpn,
me undies and stitch fix.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,790
I am happy to announce that on Friday,
two Fridays from now,

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,743
the 30th of November,
the great bill works will be here with 

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,980
us,
which I'm so excited about.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,190
So if you want to leave questions for 
him on the subreddit,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,880
there's a thread up there slash a 
reproductions.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,410
Been a wild week for us here,
California.

13
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:47,040
And California's been getting slammed 
this week.

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,730
I'm sure you all heard there was.
Oh,

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,970
insane wildfire here in La and Ventura 
County.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,030
And uh,
starting with shooting though,

17
00:00:57,031 --> 00:01:00,770
we almost didn't even get to pay 
attention to because of the fire.

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,460
There's like,
the new cycle is like,

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,720
it's just a tragedy.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,190
It's sad,
sad stuff.

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,010
So yeah,
right around the corner from my parents'

22
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:08,844
house,
there was a shooting and thousand nodes 

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,333
and then the neck,
the neck night after the fricking whole 

24
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:16,230
town's on fire from a wildfire.
You know,

25
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:18,780
I read something,
I heard something,

26
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:20,100
and correct me if I'm wrong,
Dan,

27
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:24,240
but pretty sure this is true.
I fact I did fact check it myself.

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,460
There was one or two people that was in 
that shooting and thousand oaks that was

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,520
also in the vegas shooting at him being 
like,

30
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:35,881
it's like,
dude,

31
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:36,660
what?
I mean,

32
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,230
well that's,
that's a mind melt for that person.

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,700
But uh,
I do want to say yeah,

34
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,320
my parents were evacuated from their 
house.

35
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,240
They were staying with us.
We were,

36
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,074
luckily not that close to the fire,
but it was smokey and there was ash 

37
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,360
everywhere.
It was really scary.

38
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,190
The whole,
the main freeway in La,

39
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:57,720
the one on one was shut down.

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,980
I mean,
it was,

41
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,650
it was apocalyptic out here.
It was wild.

42
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,013
Um,
we just had the news on like the whole 

43
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,030
weekend.
Yeah.

44
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,363
I'm going to.
Couldn't believe it because it was one 

45
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,830
day.
Just everything's on fire.

46
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,330
Yeah.
And you don't know if it's,

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,060
it could spread over to where we live 
and just,

48
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,940
if the wind changes and it goes the 
wrong direction,

49
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:19,590
you know,
but um,

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,633
we're looking at a place for my parents 
just a week ago in thousand oaks or it 

51
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:28,010
was a Westlake village is where was it?
Yeah.

52
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,690
And just so we could go and it's this 
really beautiful little community,

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,870
the gated community and it's in the 
woods,

54
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:39,420
kind of in thousand oaks is like a 
nature preserve.

55
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:40,254
So a lot of the decks and they have 
trees coming out of the decks and all 

56
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:47,940
the trees are marked and it's like a 
protected area.

57
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,620
But I remember being like,
man,

58
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,810
this is pretty.
Like,

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,570
I feel like a firewood ravage this place
pretty easily.

60
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:58,380
I was telling my parents,
and that was a week ago,

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,710
that whole place burned down.
But yeah,

62
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,510
the whole plate,
that whole community burned down.

63
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,350
It's crazy stuff.
And just,

64
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,213
uh,
there's a been a real tragic loss of 

65
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:12,760
life and property.
And uh,

66
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,800
I will talk about that more later 
because there's a lot of amazing footage

67
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:18,634
and stories that came out of that that I
think is interesting and I'm crazy wild 

68
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:24,814
stuff,
dude.

69
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,780
But before we get now,
as you guys can tell from the title,

70
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,353
we have got to address a lot of the 
criticism that people have been saying 

71
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:34,774
against me.
A lot of people are tuning in probably 

72
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:40,420
to enjoy an epic meltdown for me to wash
me,

73
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,610
make a fool of myself.
So that's why I'm here.

74
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,810
Dan doesn't usually.
He's,

75
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,690
he,
he,

76
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,880
I sleep through the episode.
Yeah,

77
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,580
it has it on mute.
So I promise we will get to that.

78
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,890
I'm just going to be fireworks guys.
It's going to be a firewall.

79
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,773
But before we get to that,
I do want to do a goof for the day to 

80
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,600
kind of lighten it up a little bit here.
What this vape God,

81
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,940
the Fda,
uh,

82
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,853
Tommy the vape God.
Somehow this epic troll got on Fox News 

83
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,800
too,
I guess.

84
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,410
Uh,
he's speaking on behalf of the,

85
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,180
how do you call those?
Damn the jewels.

86
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,990
Yeah.
Which is these tiny little vape pen,

87
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:23,824
it's like a pocket vape pen that 
apparently like in middle school and 

88
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,910
high school,
everybody's hitting these jewels,

89
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:32,680
which is so crazy to me because when I 
was a kid smoking was already not cool.

90
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:33,514
There was a couple of people that like 
went out in high school to smoke a 

91
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:37,480
cigarette,
but now all of a sudden with vaping it's

92
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,314
like cool again and these kids are 
hitting these jewels that like 16 years 

93
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,570
old.
Um,

94
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,733
so this,
this guy got on the news and it's just 

95
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,020
instant credit

96
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,853
installation specifically with regard to
flavored varietals that have helped 

97
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:55,230
propelled explosion in the use among the
young here.

98
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:56,064
Now to focus on very separate sides of 
this issue that Schwab is Dr Tom Scott 

99
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,290
Gabelli,
a blogger at barstool sports.

100
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:08,460
Who affectionally goes by the name.
Tommy smokes.

101
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,530
So because of the videos,
the first thing I'm gonna try sick.

102
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,600
Yeah.
That guy rips that zone and know both.

103
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,390
When they give me those,
do they think,

104
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,650
I really think that Fox News always

105
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,593
does this,
where they'll bring like I was watching 

106
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:36,050
this video during the cabinet,
that whole thing,

107
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,540
they brought on a guy who says he's an 
actual,

108
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,374
which that does incantations against him
and he's like the most absurd looking 

109
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:46,154
person you can imagine.
It's like they always bring on these 

110
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,460
people that you can't tell if they're 
serious or not,

111
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:51,350
which are like the perfect punching band
to there.

112
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,250
So this guy is a apparently I think 
she's taking him seriously,

113
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,360
which is wild bird song.
Joel Kenya.

114
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,700
Wow,
that's cool.

115
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,673
All right.
Sell me on why these flavored e-cigs 

116
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,280
shouldn't be regulated even,
uh,

117
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,870
when teens are using them and these 
increasing numbers will look.

118
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:13,730
I'm 22 years old so I'm using them 
legally and honestly they're just cool.

119
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,020
They're cool.
You rip them.

120
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,040
There's nothing cooler than blowing a 
fat cloud.

121
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,340
Right?
That's truly the Colossus of cloud.

122
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,780
It helps my swag,
it helps my drip.

123
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,630
I just love walking around.
It's really good for getting chicks too.

124
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,464
So honestly,
I started about a year ago and I know 

125
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,260
that I haven't looked back since I have 
a question.

126
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,970
No,
it's.

127
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,200
You use your cell phone quite a bit?
Yeah,

128
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,100
quite a bit.
Okay.

129
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:41,300
So why don't you rig it up to your phone
and that way you won't have like the,

130
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,310
the actual calories burned by grabbing 
your phone so you can visit

131
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,190
what I'm talking about.
She completely lost.

132
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,890
Wait,
where's it gone?

133
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,733
Hold on.
Whoa.

134
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,293
Wow.

135
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,153
Ape and kind of check email and texts at
the same time you have like right off 

136
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:56,911
the side.
Okay.

137
00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:57,990
You could,
that'll be your invention.

138
00:06:57,991 --> 00:07:00,180
I'm giving it to you so you can vape 
like this.

139
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,530
Yeah,
right.

140
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,630
Like you don't have to keep switching 
devices.

141
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,740
The humor that.

142
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,320
Did she preplanned that gag or what 
seems like I'm throwing the.

143
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,363
She's like,
yeah.

144
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,433
The whole writing team came together and
we decided you should vape betty or 

145
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:19,250
phone.
Well I don't know if this goes anywhere,

146
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:21,620
but I just wanted to give a shout out to
Tommy smokes.

147
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,710
The vape.
God what a legend.

148
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,163
You know,
he went out there and Fox and he goes 

149
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:30,680
into the lion's den and he and he fought
the good fight.

150
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,880
He held his own.
Yeah,

151
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,661
he,
he,

152
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,020
you know.
And for those of you wondering,

153
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,360
does vaping help you get checks?
Yes.

154
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,190
Isla didn't truly loved me until I 
started blowing fat clouds interface.

155
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,653
So shout out to Tommy now.
Let's get to the reason we are all here 

156
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:49,004
today.

157
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,100
I've been thinking a lot about this.
Let me take a little sip of water here.

158
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,823
This is difficult for me to talk about 
because it's something I've been 

159
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:03,134
thinking a lot about of late trying to 
wrap my head around it and think about 

160
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:08,294
it,
you know,

161
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,280
honestly and critically and trying to 
deal with things in a healthier,

162
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,900
more mature way.
And it's kind of.

163
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,960
I have a long winded kind of story here 
that I hope that will be interesting and

164
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:27,794
maybe helpful for some people.
Maybe it helps some people explain and 

165
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:36,331
understand where I've been coming from.
There's been a lot of criticism of me of

166
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,310
late,
uh,

167
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,740
there's been a lot of people that have 
said,

168
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:43,670
uh,
lots of lots and lots of videos and,

169
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:44,504
um,
I have a natural aversion to criticism 

170
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,293
specifically,
which is something that I've been 

171
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:54,680
learning about myself through therapy,
which I've started recently.

172
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,333
And so

173
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,560
throughout my career I've.

174
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,680
Well,
let me start from the top.

175
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:04,590
I'm getting ahead of myself.
What do people have been saying about me

176
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,700
recently?
Okay.

177
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,653
That I'm a hypocrite.
That I prioritize money over everything 

178
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:14,280
else,
that I've thrown friends under the bus,

179
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:15,114
that I'm ignorant and poorly informed 
and spread misinformation that I'm 

180
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,853
arrogant,
that I cannot handle criticism and that 

181
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:26,310
I've used to people just to name a 
couple of the reoccurring themes.

182
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:28,620
I'm sure there's so much more you could 
say about me.

183
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,230
Um,
and let me just say this,

184
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,064
okay.
For the record that I am guilty of all 

185
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:40,071
of those things and I'm not going to 
quantify it or make excuses or anything.

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,730
I've done those things.
I am guilty of those things.

187
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:47,980
And,
uh,

188
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,750
and this is something that I've been 
aware of myself over the past couple,

189
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,703
last two years or so,
is that I have been kind of slipping 

190
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,210
into a very unhealthy place mentally and
uh,

191
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,420
I want to try to go through this and 
make sense of it.

192
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:07,254
Okay.
So it's been kind of a slow moving 

193
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:13,590
process.
It's been like a self fulfilling process

194
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:17,610
in a way where it's gotten worse and 
worse and I get criticized more and more

195
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:19,890
and I get more defensive or more hold 
up.

196
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,870
And I went and,
you know,

197
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,704
early on in our youtube career,
I went very early on to somebody that 

198
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:28,854
was universally liked.
I remember in 2016 I could do no wrong 

199
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,563
on youtube

200
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,600
and like on,
on Reddit,

201
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,570
everybody loved us.
We were voted like Reddit,

202
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,620
reddit,
youtube channel the year or something,

203
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,430
2016.
And like the concept of being criticized

204
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:49,264
on,
on that level was something I hadn't 

205
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,240
dealt with.
Um,

206
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,513
and I think the problem was that I,
people had me very high on a pedestal 

207
00:10:58,151 --> 00:10:58,930
back then.
I mean,

208
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,763
people thought very highly of me and 
there's no doubt that at the time it 

209
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:07,111
definitely started to go to my head as 
well and I'm pretty sure,

210
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:08,134
you know,
looking back that I started to become 

211
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:15,421
more arrogant and overconfident and on 
some probably deep unconscious level,

212
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,210
a feeling of almost infallibility that I
could take anything on that.

213
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:25,930
Uh,
when I had,

214
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,550
I had like this one.
I really did.

215
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:30,910
I mean,
it's hard to come to terms with that and

216
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:35,050
to confront that because at the time 
you'll never rationally be like,

217
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,280
oh,
I'm,

218
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm out of control.
I need to tone it down.

219
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:39,274
Right.
And so because of this combination of 

220
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:46,600
like overconfidence and feeling like I 
could take everything on,

221
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,610
it led me to make a lot of mistakes.
And then when I was criticized for those

222
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,400
mistakes,
then I would act extremely

223
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,490
defensive and nasty and not really 
processing them in a healthy way.

224
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,343
Like for example,
the leafy thing was and the Wall Street 

225
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,623
Journal thing and stuff like this where 
I kind of just handled things in a 

226
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,064
really overconfidence,
really thinking that I can take on the 

227
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,650
world.
And not and not do wrong.

228
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,050
And then when I ended up fucking up and 
finds out,

229
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,900
it comes out.
Then when I get criticized,

230
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:25,300
I completely shut down.
I really,

231
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:28,030
I have the cycle I'm learning now 
through therapy,

232
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,270
which I've just started doing about a.
I've only been doing it for like a month

233
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,540
or two,
but I have a psychological,

234
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,390
a problem where when I went for,
for whatever reason that I don't want to

235
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:41,224
get into.
But the way I was raised is that when 

236
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:44,830
I'm,
when I'm criticized,

237
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:45,664
I psychologically shut down.
And so before I became like famous on 

238
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:53,050
the Internet,
I had a problem with criticism,

239
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:57,160
but it was so much less amplified.
But kind of like when you become famous,

240
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,630
whatever,
for lack of a better word,

241
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,663
it,
it,

242
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,770
amplifies certain aspects of,
of yourself.

243
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,930
And it definitely puts you through a 
gauntlet of sorts of kind of,

244
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:11,764
um,

245
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,370
learning about yourself on an emotional 
level and brings out all your flaws,

246
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,413
amplifies everything.
And so that thing of not being able to 

247
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:23,964
handle criticism in my personal life was
something that I could get by on my 

248
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:29,310
life.
And not really have any problems,

249
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:33,670
but then when you have like hordes of 
people on the Internet criticizing Gill,

250
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,733
it can get so overwhelming that it 
actually can cause for me like a real 

251
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:44,130
psychological shutdown,
which what I mean by that is like,

252
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,380
I just feel it feels to me so powerful.
Like it feels like somebody died.

253
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:50,843
Like I get so emotionally and so well.
The result of that one is like I'm 

254
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,163
extremely lethargic,
like I'll just lay down on the carpet 

255
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:00,361
with like,
no.

256
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:01,194
Well then the other thing is that like 
obviously I get super defensive and 

257
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:06,534
super irritable and super aggressive 
towards those that criticized me in a 

258
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,730
way that's not healthy.
And,

259
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:16,731
and instead of learning from criticism,
deflecting it all the time and making it

260
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,200
the world's problem and not mine.
Right?

261
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,783
So that's kind of where my head was 
after these first blunders I made from 

262
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,070
overconfidence,
I would say.

263
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:37,310
And did you know things that I regret.
And it shattered my ego in a way.

264
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:42,630
And a real fundamental way that I've 
also learned about myself is that I'm in

265
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,560
my mind.
And again,

266
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:46,050
this is through pet therapy that's been 
really helpful for me,

267
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,143
is that I'm in my best,
most creative place when I have that 

268
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:53,600
confidence and that kind of,

269
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,143
uh,
not,

270
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,010
not a place of a overconfidence or 
arrogance,

271
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:01,920
but just feeling like that people like 
what I'm doing,

272
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:04,770
that I like what I'm doing,
that it should be a wholesome,

273
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,180
great thing.
I said that.

274
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,153
And so I think that's one of the root 
problems with why I've had so much 

275
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,953
trouble creating videos for such a long 
time is because I've kind of lost my 

276
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:16,790
footing.
Um,

277
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,173
I've lost that wholesome place.
And so everything became very difficult 

278
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,970
for me,
having shattered my ego and never having

279
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,340
address that or deal with it or 
confronted it.

280
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,260
And so what happened from that is that 
it changed,

281
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,153
it set off a chain event of,
of defensive behavior and caused me to 

282
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,304
be depressed.
So I want to make clear that I'm not 

283
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,250
using depression as an excuse for acting
shitty.

284
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:45,084
It's actually the opposite.
I was not processing and handling 

285
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,740
criticism.
I was losing my confidence,

286
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:56,340
my ego was shattered and therefore I 
couldn't make videos.

287
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:58,650
And all this other stuff,
and that's what caused the depression.

288
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,360
And so what happened now is that the 
depression actually made everything even

289
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:04,500
worse,
right?

290
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:06,710
It made it even harder for me.
Um,

291
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,320
so it got worse and worse.
I get criticized more and more.

292
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,270
I get more and more defensive and closed
up.

293
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,200
And uh,
I want,

294
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,600
I want to make clear,
you know,

295
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,043
I just kept shoving it all deep down and
becoming more and more depressed 

296
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,000
essentially.
And it's only been,

297
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,330
uh,
recently that I've been.

298
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,390
I've kind of hit rock bottom a couple 
months ago where I was so amped up.

299
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:42,284
I was so,
so the depression that amplifies all my 

300
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,410
negative feelings,
right?

301
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,290
That's kind of what the problem was.
And,

302
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,590
and,
and worst of all,

303
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,980
it made me extremely irritable,
which is,

304
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,150
if,
I don't know if you know,

305
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:55,520
like irritable on that,
on that level,

306
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,893
but it's the worst.
It's the worst because not only do you 

307
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:00,554
piss people off,
but you start to hate yourself to them 

308
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,200
because you're,
you know,

309
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,034
you're acting irrationally.
But the emotion is so strong that it's 

310
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:11,630
like,
it can't be ignored.

311
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,420
Like just with Isla,
for example,

312
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:18,120
at home,
like um,

313
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,410
a lot of times when I would get 
aggravated or upset,

314
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:22,244
I would direct my frustration towards 
you even though it had nothing to do 

315
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,000
with you because I was so irritable and 
I,

316
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,873
and I'm up to and in that moment I know 
that it's fucked up and I'm being an 

317
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:32,354
asshole and I hate myself so much for it
and I see that it's upsetting you and 

318
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:37,880
then you get angry at me.
But it's like,

319
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,870
it's just this overwhelming Iraq

320
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,590
journal and I've even learned 
irritability.

321
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,023
I would know that.
It's almost like you're not being 

322
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:48,580
yourself right now,
but it's such a cycle that I can.

323
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,010
I still,
I can't not get

324
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,990
upset because you're being worse,
dude.

325
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,650
You being crazy.
So I have every right to be upset and we

326
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:57,640
know that and then it's just such a 
cycle,

327
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,160
like,
can't get out of it.

328
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,450
So because of this crazy irritability,
I was really.

329
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:11,631
I'm just making everything more 
amplified.

330
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,690
I was reacting way too strongly and way 
too negatively lead almost everything.

331
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,513
Even the slightest annoyance.
I would lash out at things and people 

332
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:21,840
that were completely blameless,
Super Moody,

333
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:22,980
irritable,
guilty,

334
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:27,981
always in my head about something and 
even a negative comment or somebody even

335
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,244
criticizing me and the slightly 
slightest would like set me off and I 

336
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:37,470
would just shut down.
Even people that like respectfully would

337
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:41,610
disagree with me,
with turn me like bitterly against them.

338
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,520
So on so bad,
right?

339
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,890
I was feeling I was being attacked,
like fit.

340
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:48,330
Like it was,
like I said,

341
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:49,260
it feels like somebody is dying.

342
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,970
I feel like I'm physically being 
attacked,

343
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:55,920
almost like a flight or fight or flight.
Um,

344
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,040
so for the longest time being stuck in 
my head and not being able to.

345
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,380
So the first two years I've,
I've,

346
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,910
I've always felt like I'm not been able 
to grown or learn or maturing,

347
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,643
which is so difficult because I have 
felt so stuck in like this really dark 

348
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,820
black hole of negative feelings.
Just such an awful place.

349
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,260
And being so frustrated [inaudible] I'm 
like,

350
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:19,230
why am I stuck here?
How do I get added here?

351
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,490
What do I do about this?
And growing more and more desperate,

352
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,590
you know,
by the week and just falling deeper into

353
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:26,424
that black hole.
And so I would say about a month or two 

354
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:32,400
are about two,
three months ago it was when I kinda hit

355
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:36,600
rock bottom and I was like,
it was so.

356
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,660
I was just so miserable that I was so 
tired of being myself that I was willing

357
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:47,820
to do anything to be anything I want.

358
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,683
I didn't know longer want it to be 
myself because I was prescribed 

359
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:54,834
antidepressants so long time ago.
And all throughout my life doctors have 

360
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:02,070
been trying to get me to take them.
But I've always not wanted to take them.

361
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:07,071
And I think the reason for that is,
was probably that will.

362
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:09,490
One of the reasons was that I always 
felt like I wasn't,

363
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,383
hadn't done enough to fix myself.
Like I kind of had this unreasonable 

364
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:18,150
expectation that I should be exercising 
two hours every day and eating salad for

365
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:21,180
every meal and that somehow it's going 
to Jeremiah depression.

366
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:22,014
And until I had done that,
then I had no right to take 

367
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,073
antidepressants.
But I think another aspect was that I 

368
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:33,471
felt that it was weak or that it was 
that it would,

369
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,880
that I was weak or that it was somehow 
giving up or that it was,

370
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,840
it would change me.

371
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,973
I was afraid I'm not a big drug user 
because I don't like altering my state 

372
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:47,860
of mind and I don't like becoming 
reliant on drugs.

373
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,810
But I was afraid that it would change 
me.

374
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,880
And I think at that rock bottom moment I
felt so strongly that,

375
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,570
you know,
what,

376
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,320
if it changes me good because I don't 
want to be this person anymore.

377
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,920
Whatever.
I remember hearing,

378
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,843
I don't know why I was thinking about 
this quote from Paul Mccartney and John 

379
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,510
Lennon talked about acid use and Paul 
said he never really loved it because he

380
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:13,414
was afraid of it changing him.
But John loved it so much because he 

381
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:22,531
wanted it to change him.
And I will always thought how,

382
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,763
what an interesting perspective.
And I feel like I felt both of their 

383
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,980
perspectives now,
you know,

384
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,870
my whole life I was like,
I don't.

385
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,860
I'm scared to change and that.
And then from going from that,

386
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:40,000
like I'll do anything to change.
I'm praying that it changes me.

387
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,660
So I had this bottle of antidepressants 
and my bedside and I said,

388
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,630
you know,
after dealing with this and hitting rock

389
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:53,381
bottom,
I just,

390
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:57,370
I started taking it.
Um,

391
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,303
I just,
I had nothing to lose and I couldn't 

392
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,440
really go on anymore like that.
And so,

393
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,730
you know,
I was,

394
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,583
I'll say this,
the antidepressant is not at all what I 

395
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:13,744
thought it would be.
The first two to three weeks was a 

396
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:17,494
little rough,
I think as your body adjusts to their 

397
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:22,540
medicine because there was kind of,
well,

398
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,280
first of all I was in such a bad place 
mentally.

399
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:28,360
It's Kinda hard to tell what was going 
on in my mind and what I was feeling.

400
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:33,361
But it definitely made me feel kinda 
like foggy and loopy and zoned out.

401
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,660
I'm really zoned out.
Like sometimes I would just be like,

402
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,613
just not just totally absent.
I can remember once in the driving lot 

403
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:50,050
of Ralph's,
we're driving and like,

404
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:51,750
um,
there was some,

405
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,593
uh,
crossing the street and you're almost 

406
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:54,760
done instead.
Well,

407
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:55,594
I was driving super slow and he was 
walking slow watching my car so I was 

408
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,940
ever going to hit him because he saw me 
coming,

409
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,650
but like he was standing there waiting 
for me to stop for him and I was staring

410
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:06,484
right at him,
but I was just inching forward and I 

411
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:11,110
just was like,
are you going to stop?

412
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,300
And I was like,
what he taught and I just,

413
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,640
I didn't see it.
I was just so,

414
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,820
like.
So I almost,

415
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,220
I actually almost gave up on the 
antidepressant.

416
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,300
Uh,
there was a time where I was like,

417
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,530
oh,
this sucks.

418
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,403
But then I would say around like three 
or four weeks because everybody says it 

419
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:31,774
can be rough in the beginning.
And then it starts to work after like 

420
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,700
three or four weeks and the side effects
go away.

421
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,520
I had a lot of anxiety too about being 
able to perform,

422
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,413
being able to come out in the podcast.
We're make videos and feel like I'm 

423
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:43,914
myself.
And I kind of proved to myself that I 

424
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:47,744
was capable of that,
that he's a lot of my anxiety about 

425
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:51,224
taking it to.
But what I noticed about the anti 

426
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,060
depressant after all the side effects 
went away and the fogginess and all this

427
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:04,010
annoying stuff is that I was,
it's Kinda,

428
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,520
it's kind of crazy.
But I was not irritable anymore.

429
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,520
Yeah.
I was still depressed.

430
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:13,280
I was still anxious.
I was still miserable.

431
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,533
But what it did for me that has been so 
amazing and I'm so thankful for is that 

432
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:20,144
it first of all remove the irrational 
irritability and kind of gave me the 

433
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:30,521
foundation and the tools to start seeing
things more for what they are

434
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,813
and not

435
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,273
this kind of crazy irrational,
irritable madness that I was 

436
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,633
experiencing the world through.
And so that for me was the first huge 

437
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:51,010
breakthrough I had in dealing with my 
situation.

438
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,660
And I would just notice it and things 
mostly at home with Isla and stuff.

439
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,653
Yeah.
Things that usually cause somehow fight 

440
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,410
for no reason.
All of a sudden we were like,

441
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:02,940
Oh wow,
we did this without Friday.

442
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,610
I didn't even get a little.
Yeah,

443
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,930
almost removed my irritability 
completely.

444
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,430
And I'm telling you this was

445
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,073
like

446
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,540
a godsend.
I mean life changing,

447
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:19,240
really life changing.
And it hasn't changed anything else.

448
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:20,890
I'm calm.
I'm completely the same.

449
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,563
I'm just less irritable and it's just,
it's amazing what I learned about 

450
00:25:26,261 --> 00:25:27,094
antidepressants that it just,
all it does is blocks to your serotonin 

451
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,360
receivers.
So there,

452
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,480
as I understand it,
and I could be wrong about this,

453
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:35,314
but it's called a serotonin uptake 
inhibitor and so your body produces 

454
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:40,894
serotonin,
which regulate your mood and your 

455
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:44,050
happiness and contentness and stuff like
that.

456
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,120
And so this drug blocks the receptor 
that absorbs the Serotonin,

457
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,000
so it makes more serotonin available for
your brain.

458
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,370
Teasers.
So.

459
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,340
So,
um,

460
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,470
so it just makes you a little more.
You're,

461
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,470
it's,
it makes your moods a little better.

462
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,210
Really.
I began for me,

463
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:07,900
it didn't change me at all except that 
my irritability completely went away.

464
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,333
And so things that were making me crazy 
before I was able to see it for what it 

465
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:17,560
was,
which I cannot.

466
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,310
Just little things like it's just 
irrational.

467
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,010
So all of a sudden you see it as like,
oh,

468
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:25,840
it's just a little thing.
It's not there.

469
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,453
You know,
where before it would set you off into 

470
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:31,060
like ruin my day,
running your day

471
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:31,963
or we will get in a fight and then it 
would ruin and then I would feel bad 

472
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:36,320
about making,
about snapping at you.

473
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,360
And it was.
But like how was it for you?

474
00:26:38,361 --> 00:26:39,350
And when I started like,

475
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,400
yeah,
I noticed it immediately.

476
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:47,060
All of a sudden like it's almost like we
switched all of a sudden ICM,

477
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,930
irritable compared to you.
I know,

478
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:51,540
I know that like I'm not an irritable 
person,

479
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:53,010
I think.
No you're not.

480
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,210
You've always been like super sane and 
grounded and,

481
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,870
and great.
And I and I,

482
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,160
I wouldn't notice situations where I was
like,

483
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,670
so it's like we switched a little bit 
because I would be like,

484
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,270
oh,
come on,

485
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,650
something that would upset me.
And you're like,

486
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,513
eh,
it's fine.

487
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,290
Yeah.
So,

488
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,430
but you're certainly.
Yeah,

489
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,630
definitely.
But you're the same person.

490
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,763
Yeah.

491
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,713
So that was the first really important 
step for me because I could now see 

492
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,690
things clear.
I could analyze things,

493
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:25,980
clear and boy,
what a difference.

494
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:26,850
I mean,
my goodness,

495
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,760
there's so much stigma against 
antidepressants and I really,

496
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:31,010
truly,
and I,

497
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,550
and I was guilty of that

498
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,030
two I taught,
you know,

499
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,913
Eh,
you don't want to take it if you don't 

500
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:38,930
have to.
I don't even know why they had that.

501
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,420
Well,
if there is like you're a,

502
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:42,080
you feel almost like a loser,
like you're weak.

503
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:44,120
Like you failed to solve your own 
issues.

504
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,900
Now before we started doing youtube and 
stuff,

505
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:49,190
I wasn't that irritable.
Right?

506
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,990
No.
So was,

507
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,893
it kind of made me feel more like how I 
used to remember being in a sense that 

508
00:27:55,011 --> 00:27:55,844
I,
I always prided myself on being a more 

509
00:27:57,381 --> 00:27:59,030
calm,
rational,

510
00:27:59,090 --> 00:27:59,923
rational,
rational person and that kind of the 

511
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,140
self image I had kind of melted away and
replaced me with this really grumpy,

512
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,520
obnoxious person that I was starting to 
hate

513
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,410
so that,
that was huge.

514
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:18,244
I mean,
that's huge and I'm still on it and I'm 

515
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:24,130
so happy that I'm taking it.
I remember in college once there was,

516
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,583
um,
I was having awful anxiety and you guys 

517
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:31,960
might know I had like generalized 
anxiety disorder.

518
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,033
I could have benefited so much from 
antidepressants in college and I 

519
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:36,424
remember there was a sign at my very 
progressive school ucse and it said 

520
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:41,224
something like,
it had like Prozac and PROZAC nation 

521
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,600
making some artsy claim that like,
oh,

522
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,760
we're all overmedicated and we're all on
PROZAC.

523
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,820
And the undertone being like,
you don't need this,

524
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,700
you're weak,
you're a sucker if you take it.

525
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,070
And I remember seeing that being like,
yeah,

526
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,100
that's interesting.
Who needs that shit?

527
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,920
And um,
that was a very popular sentiment.

528
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,090
I would say very.
It was kind of like a anti-corporate,

529
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,940
like anti,
like we don't need your medicine.

530
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,200
Also,
I'm,

531
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,920
I'm a person that's very,
like I said,

532
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:18,250
I have,
I have an ego problem.

533
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,593
And so admitting to myself that I'm weak
and that I need the help of a medicine 

534
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,613
for me was difficult to [inaudible] was 
difficult to accept because it's in a 

535
00:29:33,461 --> 00:29:36,670
sense felt like a weakness that I 
couldn't handle it myself.

536
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,170
The truth is about that,
that I've learned is that looking,

537
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,200
reaching out for help outside yourself 
as the first and the most important step

538
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,060
and recovering from a situation like 
this because it's not a weakness,

539
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:52,894
it's,
it's truly a strength because you have 

540
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,374
to get over your own ego and you have to
accept the grace and the help of other 

541
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,310
people and the tools.
I mean,

542
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,580
this is a well researched,
funded,

543
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,983
backed by an incredible intelligent 
researchers and doctors and 

544
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:15,510
psychiatrists.
And to just write that off because you,

545
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,421
it's like,
I mean,

546
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:21,110
that's,
that's stupid.

547
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,670
That's not strength.
That's dumb.

548
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,610
Right?
So that was one aspect and now I'm,

549
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,403
the antidepressants are helping but I'm 
obviously still depressed and I am 

550
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:36,470
still,
you know,

551
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,960
not cured by any means.

552
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,513
Um,

553
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,033
excuse me.
So what was the next really important 

554
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:50,474
step is that I was recommended a 
therapist from a friend that I've been 

555
00:30:53,991 --> 00:30:57,470
doing for about like a,
probably about a month or two months,

556
00:30:57,471 --> 00:30:59,970
a month and a half.
And um,

557
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,870
the therapy has been.
I've always been skeptical about therapy

558
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:06,704
too.
I think probably for the wrong reasons 

559
00:31:07,191 --> 00:31:12,191
because it feels like week to say to 
another person,

560
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:13,064
I need help.

561
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,013
No,

562
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,640
but again,
it's like to think that you can.

563
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,683
You cannot.
It's so hard to understand what's going 

564
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:26,020
on in your own mind.
Like again,

565
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:26,870
therapist,
this.

566
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,190
My doctor is a phd.
I mean this guy has learned,

567
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,540
studied,
schooled.

568
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,823
This guy knows how the mind works and 
he's trained to diagnose it and to 

569
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,920
almost debug it.

570
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:39,983
I think it's probably seen so many 
people in so many patterns can 

571
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,460
immediately like,
yeah,

572
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,653
put together something from what you're 
describing that you would never even 

573
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,760
see.
Yeah,

574
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:51,810
he's seen it all man,

575
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,783
but the thing that like stuff from my 
childhood and the way I was raised and 

576
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,403
the way that I reacted things,
there's psychological explanations that 

577
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:03,184
are so important to explore so that you 
can deepen your understanding of not 

578
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:08,314
only yourself but the world that gives 
you this incredible empathy for how 

579
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:14,440
other people's minds work and how 
they're affected by their environment.

580
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,693
And as I touched on earlier,
there is a very good psychological 

581
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:21,124
explanation for why I get so defensive 
and shut down from criticism that I 

582
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:28,594
don't want really need to get into.
It was just goes back to the way I was 

583
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:34,300
raised.
But just learning about that and knowing

584
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:35,134
about that and talking about it is so 
therapeutic and it's so important that 

585
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:42,434
it's given me such a good vantage point 
and it's given me kind of the tools and 

586
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:46,514
a little more support and foundation to 
talk to even come here and talk to you 

587
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:54,080
guys about this like this now and to 
think about it more of a healthy way and

588
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:54,914
to

589
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,253
um,

590
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,230
it'll last time I came in here and 
address Chris and all the podcasts I was

591
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:05,400
ranting and raving and going look in 
like a freaking lunatic.

592
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,130
And,

593
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:07,963
and,
um,

594
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,300
that's just the symptom of everything 
that I was describing.

595
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,423
And so for me,
being able to come here and talk about 

596
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:18,304
this with you guys I think is important 
for me because I see the podcast as if 

597
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:31,790
nothing else honest.
You know,

598
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:34,700
like when I sit here for two hours,
live,

599
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,030
unedited over the course of nearly 100 
episodes,

600
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:41,360
now 100 and hundreds of hours of footage
of me unedited.

601
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,940
It's nothing else but at least honest,
right?

602
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,360
Because I cannot hide who I am.
I cannot hide my defects,

603
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,880
cannot hide my stupid comments.
I cannot hide my um,

604
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,530
short temper.
My dushene is my shitty hosting it,

605
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,211
you know,
if I,

606
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:01,250
if I recorded this and put it into a 
video,

607
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:02,450
I would cut all that shit out.

608
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,200
Yeah.
Or like you,

609
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,840
you'll try a joke.
And they were like,

610
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:08,270
well that didn't come off right.
So let's do it again.

611
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,040
But here you don't even to.
And you can't know.

612
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,970
And to be honest with you,
it's,

613
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:15,804
this podcast has been one of the most 
difficult things I've ever done in my 

614
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:21,870
life.
Like physically,

615
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,260
if you talk about it from the standpoint
of just sitting and doing it,

616
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,080
it looks like,
um,

617
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,240
it's easy to do.
Just sit here,

618
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:31,800
you show up,
you talk and you know,

619
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,520
but from a psychological,
from a mental,

620
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,330
from a,
from a lot of other positions,

621
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:40,530
this is the hardest thing I've ever had 
to do because one,

622
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,183
um,

623
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,030
there's no take backs and so not only 
are you,

624
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:53,510
the fans forced to see me more clearly 
of who I am,

625
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,553
but I am forced to see them more clearly
of who I am because I'm someone that's 

626
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,350
criticized youtubers and people on 
Youtube,

627
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,341
you know,
what you see,

628
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:02,174
it's very people,
it's very nice when you post videos and 

629
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:08,720
you can manage your it and put it out 
and you put it out for the people to see

630
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:09,554
you one way and you get to see yourself 
one way too because you cut out the 

631
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,233
stupid shit and you forget about it.
And then people see the video and 

632
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:17,390
they're like,
this guy,

633
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,920
this guy is great.
And you're like,

634
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:20,210
yeah,
I am great.

635
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,020
And you forget about you while you're 
kind of a fucking asshole.

636
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,680
You're an hour of you being an asshole 
and then 10 minutes over your bearing.

637
00:35:27,681 --> 00:35:28,760
Good.
Exactly.

638
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,943
And so,

639
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,813
um,

640
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,940
I'm not surprised that so many people 
have watched his podcast and been like,

641
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:39,923
Whoa,
that's not the guy I thought he was or 

642
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:47,100
people who are making videos about like 
all the things I mentioned because yeah,

643
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,510
it's,
it is all in here.

644
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,393
Everything you guys have said bad about 
me and that you've noticed all my bad 

645
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,540
personality traits and all that it is.
It's all in here,

646
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,210
you know,
I can't lie about that stuff.

647
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,500
It's all here.
So it's been difficult,

648
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:07,334
especially with this condition I've had 
of being like depressed and irritable 

649
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,010
and having a psychological Lee,
a unhealthy response to criticism,

650
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,140
but it's all played out here

651
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,893
and,
and it's Kinda the only way to do the 

652
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:23,930
podcast.
Like our first five episodes.

653
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,830
Maybe we were trying to edit it down the
footage and thinking about it.

654
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:31,910
Like we used to think about a video but 
it just wasn't right.

655
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,863
Like,
you're cutting now in conversation and 

656
00:36:34,431 --> 00:36:38,600
then you're making decisions on what to 
live and it's not natural.

657
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:43,490
Exactly.
We came to the conclusion that it has to

658
00:36:43,491 --> 00:36:44,660
be like this.
That's,

659
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,523
that's right.

660
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,600
It's a podcast.
Needs to be honest,

661
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,583
it needs to be uncut because you've got 
to see the essence and the soul of 

662
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:53,120
what's there.
A lot of times,

663
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:53,954
like you were saying,
you though we would try to cut out a 

664
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,640
part of me saying something stupid or 
are not just me,

665
00:36:58,641 --> 00:36:59,550
but the gas stove.

666
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,151
We're like,
oh,

667
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,200
this is a boring moment.

668
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,270
And um,
that's just,

669
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,460
I think a lot of people were feeling and
we're feeling that,

670
00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:09,010
that it's like,
this is a weird.

671
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,193
And so we took this leap into doing it 
live and it's been really tough and 

672
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:14,920
really challenging and

673
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,263
um,

674
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,990
very exposing of me.
I'm here bare naked in a way.

675
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,693
But I also think it's been really 
amazing for me too because it's kind of 

676
00:37:25,491 --> 00:37:26,324
brought me here now where I've been able
to just take finally a close look at 

677
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:32,444
myself and see it for 'em,
see it more clearly in a way that I've 

678
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:40,994
craved so much these past two years to 
just feel like I'm maturing and I'm 

679
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:49,120
growing and I'm becoming a better,
more wholesome person.

680
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,400
And I'm just stuck.
I'm just like,

681
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:54,780
why am I so fucking stuck with trying to
be crazy?

682
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,380
Yeah,
you would say that to me a lot to stop.

683
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:01,200
I just feel like I'm stuck.

684
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,890
That's where or how or where,
but just feeling like I'm just pinned to

685
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:10,220
the floor or you know,
in a way in a hamster wheel.

686
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:12,763
Um,

687
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,493
but I think it's been a,
it's been an amazing experience in that 

688
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:22,990
way that we've all,
we've all been just,

689
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,741
you know,
here.

690
00:38:23,741 --> 00:38:25,810
Here it is.
I said those things,

691
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:27,700
I did those things.
I am that person

692
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,553
and it's good.
It's good to acknowledge that and feel 

693
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:36,190
that and be like a,
you know,

694
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,070
it's good.
You got to,

695
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:41,080
you got to accept that catches walk 
blindly.

696
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:44,080
And I mean it's just so messed up,
dude.

697
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,520
Like I said,
it's just a black hole and it's not,

698
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,210
it's just what I didn't understand.
It's just,

699
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,083
it's strength.
It's not weakness to come before 

700
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:59,191
yourself and confront your many 
shortcomings as a human being instead of

701
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:06,460
ignoring them.
And I think I was just,

702
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:10,140
I couldn't.
It was too painful for me too.

703
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,073
It was,
my ego was hurt and I was just too 

704
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:16,330
painful for me.

705
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,223
Um,

706
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,480
it's so weird.
The psychology of it is so weird.

707
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:28,314
You know,
you think it'd be so easy to just be 

708
00:39:29,311 --> 00:39:29,581
like,
yeah,

709
00:39:29,581 --> 00:39:30,361
you're right.
You know,

710
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:34,770
I fucked up,
but it can be so painful.

711
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,250
As Elton John Famously said,
sorry.

712
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,580
Seems to be the hardest word.

713
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,403
Um,

714
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,100
yeah.
I don't know why.

715
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,560
So it can be so hard.
Maybe not for other people,

716
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:49,920
but again,
this is my specific problem.

717
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:52,260
I think that I'm now learning about 
myself.

718
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:59,340
And I said the Ila something recently,
I'm still depressed,

719
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,280
but for the first time in such a long 
time,

720
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,370
I feel like there's a light at the end 
of the tunnel,

721
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,360
which for me it was this black hole.
There was no escape,

722
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:10,194
there was no answer.
All I could think of was just permanent 

723
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,073
darkness.
And now a subtle name with the help of 

724
00:40:19,441 --> 00:40:21,750
friends,
with the help of therapy,

725
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:22,584
with the help of antidepressants,
with the help of Isla has been with me 

726
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:30,891
this whole time.
There's just finally I can kind of see a

727
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:38,601
path forward to getting better,
a path to walk towards the light,

728
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,300
you know,
and you know,

729
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:43,860
with a kid on the way,
my God,

730
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:48,360
I don't want to be,
I want to be better than this,

731
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,900
right?
Like asking them to be tough,

732
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,190
tough enough.
I don't need to make it harder.

733
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,710
Um,
I,

734
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,544
you know,

735
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,720
I want to say,
you know,

736
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:15,540
I readily admit that I've been at times 
the awful host,

737
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:20,570
a terrible interviewer here,
the awful habits as a podcast host,

738
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,250
um,
you know,

739
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,340
speak on things that I don't know nearly
enough about.

740
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,323
Speak with certainty about things that I
shouldn't and I definitely need to do 

741
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:35,210
better on these fronts.
I need to be better,

742
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:38,240
I need to do better and I expect myself 
and I want to be better.

743
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,693
I've been,
you know,

744
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,470
I've heard someone say,
I forget who said it,

745
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,590
but they said if you're under a hundred 
podcasts,

746
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,750
then you really have no idea what you're
doing.

747
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,500
And I really hope that's true because 
we're co,

748
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,373
this is number 93 and I know I still 
have so much to learn and improve as a 

749
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:57,890
person,
as a host,

750
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,400
as an entertainer,
as a human being,

751
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,920
and we only have seven figures now and 
yet,

752
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,640
despite all that,
so many of you have continued to support

753
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:08,474
us and show us love and appreciation and
to see the goodness and the sweetness 

754
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:18,461
end me despite my best efforts to thwart
you at times.

755
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,230
I think part of me was so I was so,
um,

756
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,413
felt so distance from the fans in a way 
recently because on one hand there's 

757
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:31,970
people that hate me.
And so I'm like,

758
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:32,804
Oh fuck them.
I don't even want to read the comment 

759
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:36,740
because I'm too fragile.
And then the people that love me,

760
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,210
I feel like because I hated myself and 
didn't love myself,

761
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,840
that the love that they will show me 
wasn't genuine,

762
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,100
that I couldn't accept it.

763
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,900
It was just them being nice or whatever.
I don't know.

764
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,420
And so I think that,
yeah,

765
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:57,260
I just,
I dunno,

766
00:42:57,261 --> 00:42:59,480
I couldn't accept any of it.
It was just too much for me,

767
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:01,963
but I do want to say that from the most 
sincere and appreciative plates for the 

768
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:07,304
people that have continued to believe in
me and see something good in me and 

769
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:12,434
something here that you like,
that it is amazing and it means so much 

770
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:22,841
to me and I wanted to thank you all for 
your kind comments on the episode before

771
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:24,314
the Tom and Christina episode.
I had made a side that nobody seemed to 

772
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:28,094
like the podcast when there was a huge 
outpouring of love and support and the 

773
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:34,100
column is telling me that I should keep 
it up and that you guys love it.

774
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:34,934
That was unexpected and very much 
appreciated and a time that I really 

775
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:41,594
needed to hear that.
I have thought about quitting the 

776
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:46,960
podcasts honestly.
A lot.

777
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,953
Yeah.

778
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:49,763
Um,

779
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:53,410
because it's been such a pain,
you know,

780
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:57,610
it's been such a pan.
It's been so painful at times,

781
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,343
but I hope there's been good things.
It's easy to focus on the pain and the 

782
00:44:02,471 --> 00:44:05,320
field of pain and talk about the Pan,
but I hope there's also

783
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,693
no

784
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,030
another side to it.
And if you do see that side,

785
00:44:13,031 --> 00:44:16,240
I thank you so much for sticking with 
us.

786
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:22,890
And in closing to this long monologue,
which has gone quite a bit longer than I

787
00:44:24,701 --> 00:44:26,920
expected.
Um,

788
00:44:26,921 --> 00:44:29,170
I wanna say that if I have disappointed 
you,

789
00:44:29,171 --> 00:44:32,190
I'm sorry,
I know I can be better

790
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,023
and I want to be better.
And to those that have continued to 

791
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:38,100
support us and spend your Friday,
your blessing Fridays here with us.

792
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,160
I want to say thank you for believing in
me and looking past my imperfections and

793
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:46,020
giving me the strength and support to 
push through it.

794
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:48,923
And I do think that it's important for 
me to talk about these things because I 

795
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:53,004
think there's a lot of people out there 
that can relate to my feelings of this 

796
00:44:58,681 --> 00:45:02,040
whole depressive attitude and putting 
off getting help.

797
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:05,190
Because somehow for whatever reason in 
your head,

798
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:08,940
I'm sure everyone has their own reasons,
but that it makes you vulnerable or weak

799
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:13,740
or whatever it is.
But I hope that people can take anything

800
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:14,574
from this.
That it's actually your weakness and 

801
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,940
your vulnerability is part of what makes
you human.

802
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:26,150
And acknowledging that and reaching out 
to help his strength,

803
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,773
not weakness,
weakness is shutting yourself off from 

804
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:30,384
the world.
And then you can fix all your own 

805
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:32,394
problems.
That's just bitter self-loathing 

806
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,500
weakness.
And I hope that,

807
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:47,510
um,
anyone out there that is feeling,

808
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,913
you know,
feeling anything similar to what I said 

809
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,890
that you do try antidepressants and 
therapy.

810
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:55,903
There's a reason they're studied,
developed and used by millions of 

811
00:45:57,351 --> 00:45:59,510
people.
And professions is a science.

812
00:45:59,511 --> 00:46:02,210
This is a discipline.
Um,

813
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,700
these people are amazing and they're 
here to help you.

814
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,310
Um,
yeah.

815
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,123
Um,

816
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,840
anyway,
I don't know.

817
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,810
I hope that was interesting.
At least.

818
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,980
I don't know if that's what you all 
wanted to hear for me,

819
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,800
but that's it.

820
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:34,470
What do you think you'll,
um,

821
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,293
anyway,
thank you guys all for listening and 

822
00:46:38,861 --> 00:46:40,000
bearing with me through that.

823
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,813
Um,

824
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,653
so love y'all.
And we will be right back after this 

825
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,213
short break.

826
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:55,370

overpaying while shopping online,

827
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,580
especially during this holiday season.
Gifts travels,

828
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:00,200
ugly sweaters.
That all adds up.

829
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,273

852
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,970
With all the recent news about online 
security breaches,

853
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:10,330
it's hard not to worry where my freaking
data goes,

854
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,313
making an online purchase or simply 
accessing my email could put my private 

855
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:16,323
information at risk.
You're being tracked online by social 

856
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:20,740
media sites,
marketing companies,

857
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:21,723
and weird fricking pervs in the bathroom
of airports that are still in your 

858
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:27,010
credit card and your nude pictures.
That's right.

859
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:27,963
If you're using public Wifi,
Internet anywhere in a motel hotel 

860
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:31,774
without Vpn,
you were putting your butthole some 

861
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:37,120
shots at risk and I've sent Isla many 
and trust me,

862
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:39,910
I don't want anyone else seeing those.
I cannot live with that being leaked.

863
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:40,973
Okay?
That's why I decided to take my privacy 

864
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:43,900
back.

I've made famous how stretchy and 
breathable this me undies,

890
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:03,690
micro modal is.
Okay.

893
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,530
cooked perfect.
Comfort and breathability.

894
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,260
This stuff is a game changer.
Okay?

895
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,780
They've got a.
You got to try it.

896
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,370
They're really true.
This is bliss.

897
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:26,860
Okay.
Now they've got holiday prints.

898
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,913
They got new prints every Tuesday.
That means you've got no excuse not to 

899
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:33,200
celebrate the holidays right down to 
your core and why stop it.

900
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:34,034
Andy's me.

coveted micro modal fabric.

going to the store,

915
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,660
you hate shopping for clothes.
You hate picking out clothes.

916
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:29,660
I liked when I was a kid and my mom used
to dress me.

917
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,030
I'm not gonna lie.
It's so much more convenient.

918
00:51:32,031 --> 00:51:34,100
It's so much nicer and let's face it,

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,960
I will not talk about the fires.
Devastating this state until we've asked

942
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:53,270
a funny video first.
Okay,

943
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,850
now,
fair deal.

944
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,780
Do you want to watch a wedding dress 
explode or.

945
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,320
My new favorite show now on to Tlc is 
the best network on television.

946
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,670
Every show is an absolute golden 
nuggets.

947
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:11,480
You know what we're watching like a 
wedding,

948
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:15,020
Jessica.
So 90 Day fiance,

949
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:16,850
as you guys know,
is my new passion in life,

950
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:22,520
but I have to wait a week and spending 
time on the fabric.

951
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,980
Dude,
I'm in so deep and that is like gun a

952
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,843
ula,
Larissa and they are in jail and I'm 

953
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:30,150
like,
who are you talking about?

954
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,110
And there's like 90 day fiance.
Oh,

955
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,770
okay.
It's fascinating.

956
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:35,993
Right.
But you talk about them like it's a 

957
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,560
because it's,
I'm really mad,

958
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,623
so freaking amazing.
And like there's this really vibrant 

959
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:42,504
community on Reddit of 90 day fiance and
they've got all these great memes and 

960
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:50,610
discussions and it's fantastic.
It's so good.

961
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:54,900
But I need something to watch in the 
week between.

962
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:59,820
And so the new show that I've found is 
called extreme cheapskates.

963
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:06,050
Now these people are cheap on a level 
that is probably should be classified as

964
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:07,314
a mental ill because in real it's not 
like I'm getting what's on sale at 

965
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:13,764
Ralph's.
It's not like getting these guys like 

966
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,510
there's a guy and they're like proud of 
it too.

967
00:54:18,511 --> 00:54:20,370
It's very interesting.
They're all,

968
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,413
they're all,
they all have significant others that 

969
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:26,670
are super embarrassed by them,
which I find.

970
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:31,940
But yeah,
and marriage and they seem exactly,

971
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,070
they all seem to be in really healthy 
relationships.

972
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,830
But like for example,
there's this one guy,

973
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:40,080
he's like 40 and he's retired.
He's like,

974
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,183
I have financial freedom.
I'm retired from being a cheapskate and 

975
00:54:44,641 --> 00:54:46,440
none of my other friends have this,
uh,

976
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:47,933
this freedom in life and this guy spends
his whole day biking around for 12 

977
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:53,010
hours,
not because he loves biking,

978
00:54:53,011 --> 00:54:58,011
but because gas is too expensive,
I'm checking phone machines for money,

979
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:03,150
going to diners and checking the 
cushions for coins and it's like,

980
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,190
that doesn't sound like financial 
freedom.

981
00:55:05,191 --> 00:55:09,480
That sounds like you could just get a 
job and work less hours,

982
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:14,640
but they have got like this need to save
money in any way.

983
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,030
I think it's,
it's this need to feel like.

984
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:20,260
I think they got it.
They,

985
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:21,343
yeah,
they got that one up and I'm the result 

986
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:27,120
of some of this stuff is absolutely 
bananas.

987
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:31,320
So this is one of my favorite guys here.
This guy's such a legend.

988
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:35,790
He's a legend that during the first 
season they only had six episodes of sky

989
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,670
was in two of them.
By the way,

990
00:55:38,671 --> 00:55:39,504
on Amazon videos you can decide to buy a
season hd or SD and I went super in the 

991
00:55:45,871 --> 00:55:48,390
spirit of this.
Oh by the way,

992
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:52,163
it's going on there.
We were going to make a video and it 

993
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:55,914
didn't work out and all this left is a 
stupid fucking Erica that was going to 

994
00:56:00,981 --> 00:56:02,320
say you've got to show them.
Yes,

995
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,100
I love that the video didn't work out,
but you're keeping the haircut.

996
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,983
We had this whole idea for video was 
going to be so good and I cut my hair 

997
00:56:20,521 --> 00:56:21,354
for the reaction and all these sketches 
and we're sitting down editing it 

998
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,320
yesterday and I'm just like,
we're both like,

999
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,120
this isn't good.
I just cut my hair for nothing.

1000
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,083
You know?
Sometimes I'll walk outside because I 

1001
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:38,170
feel completely normal and I'll forget 
them.

1002
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:42,910
My hair looks like this and I'll walk 
outside without thinking a walk shredder

1003
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,480
and you just.
You're just that guy.

1004
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,033
I know that.
Some days I'll look in the mirror like 

1005
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,570
last night and I'm like,
kind of a good luck.

1006
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,790
Oh No.
I'm almost a kind of a good look.

1007
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,970
Yeah,
if it was a little more symmetrical.

1008
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:01,480
Yeah.
The way we kind of have your head tilted

1009
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:03,370
to the camera,
that side looks okay,

1010
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:07,750
but then you know that it's a problem.
Madmax cool.

1011
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:12,751
Hipster.
Fall out a $5,

1012
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:16,540
coffee,
coffee.

1013
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:19,803
So you know what's been interesting 
because I buzzed my whole head and I 

1014
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:27,991
took a fricking razor blade and razor 
blade my scalp and that was gnarly dude.

1015
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,170
But it was actually kind of amazing.
I have to say.

1016
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:34,810
Oh yeah.
It was painful.

1017
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:35,644
It was bad.
I have a new appreciation for people 

1018
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:41,200
that shaved their heads with razors,
but it was kind of Nice.

1019
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:44,470
I think I'm going to buzz it all off and
bic my whole fricking head.

1020
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,083
It's like it's such a freedom in a way 
because your hair's gonna grow back all 

1021
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:54,160
beautiful and healthy and like how often
do you get to see yourself?

1022
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:57,700
Just like bawled.
Everyone at home is also like,

1023
00:57:57,701 --> 00:57:59,530
fuck you dude.
Every day,

1024
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:05,820
every day as well.
It's not being bold is not a meme.

1025
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,120
I'm appropriating bulbs,
culture.

1026
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,440
Um,
where was I?

1027
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:16,780
Oh yes.
Extreme cheapskates.

1028
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:18,580
Let's see what we have here.
So yeah,

1029
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:21,970
I was saying this guy only had six 
episodes the first season.

1030
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,103
Oh No.
What I was saying is that on Amazon you 

1031
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:30,061
can buy a season hd or you can buy an SD
and save $1 and you have to dig.

1032
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:34,900
They have a more options button.
You have to go in there.

1033
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,470
And in the spirit of extreme cheap 
skating,

1034
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:39,843
I saved a dollar on this season.
I was very proud and honored with these 

1035
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:43,654
guys.

1036
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:48,100
Most people consider the paper towels 
and disposable,

1037
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:53,160
like reusing spruce it up,
bring it back to life through set up.

1038
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:57,970
Eva could reuse these paper towels three
to five times.

1039
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:03,280
Roy estimates that over the last 10 
years he saved nearly $2,000

1040
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:04,323
just by reusing paper towels,
but he also went down to a federal 

1041
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,100
savings,
totally the truth,

1042
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,120
which are kind of flimsy on these 
disposables.

1043
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,450
They get dull.
I sharpen them on the striking part of a

1044
00:59:16,451 --> 00:59:17,284
book of matches.
Give them a whole new life when you 

1045
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:23,030
can't squeeze anymore out.
Finished to be emptied.

1046
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:28,870
That's the end.
And they just toss it away and there's a

1047
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:33,883
week's worth still left in there.
I buy cheap to ply toilet paper and I 

1048
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:41,540
get two rolls out of one

1049
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:46,650
that I have that I said you need those 
two plys buddy.

1050
00:59:46,651 --> 00:59:51,651
Especially at your consumption level.
We've seen.

1051
00:59:53,521 --> 00:59:55,620
Well,
what did he eats too in that?

1052
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,910
Do we have the clip of him at the 
restaurant?

1053
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:58,990
Because I need that one.
No,

1054
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,630
but we haven't done one in the deal.
We got to watch that one.

1055
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,433
This is nothing

1056
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,343
price.
I do not enjoy two ply toilet paper 

1057
01:00:07,511 --> 01:00:11,920
being separate.
I just kind of threefold it so that it's

1058
01:00:11,921 --> 01:00:15,370
a little thicker.
His toilet play third is a lot like life

1059
01:00:15,371 --> 01:00:18,460
in general.
The closer you get to the end,

1060
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,930
the faster it seems to go.

1061
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,253
That's a pretty well.
The funny thing about that I've noticed 

1062
01:00:25,861 --> 01:00:27,350
about these cheapskate,
these,

1063
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:28,184
uh,
cheapskates is that they spent so much 

1064
01:00:31,891 --> 01:00:32,724
time,
it cannot be a worthy investment of 

1065
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,000
their time.
I guess they don't work.

1066
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:36,834
That's the thing.
But like the guy will spend an hour d 

1067
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:46,500
flying and then re rolling a roll of 
toilet paper to save like,

1068
01:00:47,351 --> 01:00:49,510
I don't know,
twenty five cents or something.

1069
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:51,603
And it's like,
man,

1070
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:52,563
these guys have.
But you've got to see this guy at the 

1071
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:56,890
restaurant because that,
that really ain't ain't nothing.

1072
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:59,050
Um,
let's see here.

1073
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,480
Extreme cheapskates,
why don't I look for it?

1074
01:01:04,481 --> 01:01:05,314
And you watch that clip where I got it,
it's too late and that it's a clip of 

1075
01:01:12,271 --> 01:01:13,680
the movie day.
You've got this one.

1076
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,090
I can't believe Roy brought me to the 
movies.

1077
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,450
I haven't been to the movie and I don't 
know.

1078
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,210
So she's begging him this whole episode 
to take her on a date night,

1079
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:23,610
which I guess they do once a month or is
it once a year?

1080
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:24,863
Once a month.
And so she wants him just to buy them a 

1081
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:30,900
soda pop and some popcorn.
And he's like,

1082
01:01:30,901 --> 01:01:32,850
well come on baby.
What are you crazy?

1083
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:38,460
So he has a novel idea that some of you 
could use at home and yourself.

1084
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:46,010
So are you hungry?
Yeah,

1085
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,280
I've told you I wanted something to 
pass.

1086
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,143
So Mike could,
I haven't been at a big waste of money 

1087
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:57,751
to buy food at the snack bar with 
concessions in any movie theater here.

1088
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,433
Keep it low here.
People smuggled food into the movies 

1089
01:02:02,371 --> 01:02:04,270
theaters all the time.
I don't like it,

1090
01:02:04,271 --> 01:02:07,180
but they do it by bringing my own 
snacks.

1091
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,340
I save at least another $10.

1092
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,910
Eating a banana and moving.
There is a sad shit.

1093
01:02:11,911 --> 01:02:12,744
I can imagine.
It's like a banana and he's begging him 

1094
01:02:17,961 --> 01:02:20,040
the whole time.
I want a and popcorn.

1095
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,730
You said you didn't want the apple to an
apple.

1096
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:24,564
I told you what I wanted when I came in 
and I want to pop corn candy or drink 

1097
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:28,603
for instance.
Well I made a movie like what is even 

1098
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:39,930
going on in that theater?
I think they went to a crazy matinee.

1099
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,240
They did go.
Yeah.

1100
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:44,310
They went to like the cheapest show of 
course.

1101
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,260
Just completely empty,
you know,

1102
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:50,440
probably it's like 3:00
PM on a when,

1103
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,410
I dunno Tuesday,
who knows?

1104
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:53,963
But here we go.

1105
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:02,770
Lucky Day popcorn,

1106
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,213
there were the garbage.
She grabs a bag of popcorn is literally 

1107
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:10,150
rummaging through the garbage.

1108
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:13,870
Okay.

1109
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:17,130
He does the decency of out at least 
judgement.

1110
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:22,180
The either gives free refills with 
popcorn and soft drinks.

1111
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,980
So I found a few containers in the 
Trish.

1112
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:26,980
I appreciate it.
That surprised my loving wife.

1113
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:32,040
So how this isn't theft by the way.
Can't beat that.

1114
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:35,830
Yeah,
pretty much.

1115
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,253
I like,
uh,

1116
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,370
he,
he pocketed a bunch of straws.

1117
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:43,270
Destroyed too.
It's just going to ask you for this dry,

1118
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:46,380
but you probably wouldn't come on.
Oh,

1119
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:47,283
nice.

1120
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:49,620
Thank you.
Wow.

1121
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,113
You know,
this lady at after being together for 

1122
01:03:53,811 --> 01:03:56,900
how long as they have,
she knows not to ask questions.

1123
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:00,080
She's just like,
thank you.

1124
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,810
You made it happen.
It's not probe to deep.

1125
01:04:02,811 --> 01:04:07,790
Here I am.
So they didn't show up,

1126
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:09,830
but at the end,
on the way out,

1127
01:04:09,831 --> 01:04:11,930
he fills up the popcorn and the sodium 
again.

1128
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:16,580
The restaurants.
Shit is crazy.

1129
01:04:16,581 --> 01:04:17,680
He goes,
I don't,

1130
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,370
I couldn't find a clip of it.
But.

1131
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,770
Well there's the other family that does 
it.

1132
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:24,740
I saw this is important.
You guys might be,

1133
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,010
I might be a,
he's like a borderline freegan.

1134
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,560
Freegan yeah.
Have you ever heard of that before?

1135
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,800
No.
Tell me about Freegan.

1136
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,040
Freeganism is,
uh,

1137
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:34,933
is people that um,
I don't know if they exclusively are 

1138
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:42,230
always vegetarians or vegans,
but they,

1139
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:43,363
they have this philosophy that it's okay
to eat anything as long as it is being 

1140
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:47,594
thrown away.
So it's like a whole diet based off of 

1141
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:53,450
dumpster diving consensually.
Here was a guy like that in the show?

1142
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:54,693
No,
I think this guy is down for anything 

1143
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:59,630
that's cheap.
So this family,

1144
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:01,130
is it going to last one?
I show you guys,

1145
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:04,970
but I urge you all to buy this on SD and
save that dollar.

1146
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:10,700
So this guy,
their house was so wild,

1147
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:14,570
so he takes his family out once a year 
with change.

1148
01:05:14,571 --> 01:05:16,890
He saves all year to treat them for 
enduring.

1149
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:21,640
Um,
so he takes them to a buffet.

1150
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,640
And uh,
this is wonderful.

1151
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,440
You can imagine the dismay on everyone's
faces up to a Chinese buffet.

1152
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,353
I couldn't believe it.
All I could see was food stacked upon 

1153
01:05:39,671 --> 01:05:44,671
each other.
We work with fine dining live in the era

1154
01:05:49,471 --> 01:05:54,471
of the table.
What the legend news.

1155
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:01,320
You're going to have whatever you want.
You guys don't seem very lumpy.

1156
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,720
You want to sit and talk and you want to
leave.

1157
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:13,100
We want to leave.
Want to go to at least give it a try.

1158
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:18,101
We at least agree to give it a try.
I guess we're hearing his wife's pond

1159
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:26,850
showed up at the last minute thing to 
always help them out I guess,

1160
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:27,580
and they're like,
oh,

1161
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,910
guess I'm aunt Auntie.
He's coming with us.

1162
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:33,970
And he was like,
yeah,

1163
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,793
this guy's a legend.
Lack of appreciation and I'm going to 

1164
01:06:40,411 --> 01:06:41,640
make sure that everybody's happy.

1165
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:50,543
Alright,
cool.

1166
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:55,430
What is that?
That's our food.

1167
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,830
The plates on it was going to pay

1168
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:04,290
for three people,
but there were six of us.

1169
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,280
Pay for three.
Delicious.

1170
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:07,123
I know I got your favorite three plates 
if I have more than this number of 

1171
01:07:11,191 --> 01:07:16,191
places that you pay for each of us to 
get the band is the band.

1172
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:19,703
That was unacceptable.
I was so mortified that he would even 

1173
01:07:22,921 --> 01:07:23,754
suggest it.

1174
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:29,850
So the guy we just washed and this guy 
does the same thing,

1175
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:30,983
so at the end of the meal they sharp 
taken out doggy bags and then everyone 

1176
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:36,750
in the restaurant who hasn't finished 
their food,

1177
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:41,330
they start hitting them up and saying,
can I take this home?

1178
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,193
That to me was the best part of the show
and I don't know why this guy paid in 

1179
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:46,260
coins too,
right?

1180
01:07:46,261 --> 01:07:47,370
Yeah.
And they don't show them pink.

1181
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,900
He whips out like a panty hose full of 
entities is so good.

1182
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:54,450
You guys gotTa Watch this show every 
day.

1183
01:07:54,451 --> 01:07:57,630
Started that Youtube trend of like,
huh,

1184
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:01,350
they're Bradbury's.
We're buying Gucci store with pennies.

1185
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:02,311
That guy's like,
dude,

1186
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:04,750
that's just my life.
I'm not even trying to make.

1187
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:09,340
What's the prank?
Oh,

1188
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:12,400
I highly recommend.
This show is so entertaining guys.

1189
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,650
There's so many more great clip.
These clubs don't even do.

1190
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:20,651
They show justice if I'm being honest,
but enough about the funny light hearted

1191
01:08:22,161 --> 01:08:25,670
stuff.
Let's bring it down now.

1192
01:08:25,671 --> 01:08:26,504
Actually,
I do want to talk about the California 

1193
01:08:27,891 --> 01:08:32,891
fires because I have a lot of incredible
footage that I want to show you guys.

1194
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,243
It has been so nuts out here like I want
to emphasize how was just one day all 

1195
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:43,700
good and then in that evening on the 
news,

1196
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:46,340
it was like the whole freaking state was
on fire.

1197
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:52,010
I heard a stat that up north.
That's the campfire,

1198
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:53,350
right?
Yeah.

1199
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,970
That this fire was spreading at the rate
of one football field.

1200
01:08:57,971 --> 01:08:58,804
A per.

1201
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,560
I don't want to say it wrong.

1202
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:08,350
One football field per second.
What's really?

1203
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:11,030
Yeah,
that sounds well maybe.

1204
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:14,360
Well,
well I mean no,

1205
01:09:14,361 --> 01:09:16,640
it's just hard to fathom it going that 
fast,

1206
01:09:16,641 --> 01:09:17,474
but I guess that's probably.
Well it explains then why up north 

1207
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:23,503
especially there's 631 people missing 
that there's a good chance that their 

1208
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:32,420
dads,
because this fire was moving so fast and

1209
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:33,254
so furious that people were chilling at 
their home or in their car in the 

1210
01:09:35,481 --> 01:09:36,314
mountains and didn't even realize they 
were in an evacuation zone and then all 

1211
01:09:40,201 --> 01:09:41,034
of a sudden you see some ambulance 
coming over the ridge and by the time 

1212
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:45,470
you're packed up on your car,
the fires consumed the whole.

1213
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,090
Yeah,
I mean,

1214
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:51,770
so there's a town up north paradise 
paradise.

1215
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:56,890
I do ironically named,
so this town,

1216
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:00,560
it was really beautiful.
I love them though with California.

1217
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:01,603
Yeah.
I mean it's really beautiful and 

1218
01:10:02,691 --> 01:10:03,524
foresty,
but the state is so dr from a lack of 

1219
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,600
rainfall that basically everything's 
just ready to go up,

1220
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:12,860
which is what makes these fires so 
severe.

1221
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,910
Um,
the population was $27,000

1222
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:18,763
and in this city nearly 12,000
homes and other structures were burned 

1223
01:10:22,971 --> 01:10:24,770
down.
12,000.

1224
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:26,560
Yeah,
it was at 6,000,

1225
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:30,050
like the whole city.
I mean,

1226
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:34,610
like a whole city was burned down.
12,000

1227
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:39,140
homes in other structures and 631 people
on accounted for.

1228
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,780
Seven people died in their cars and 
paradise.

1229
01:10:41,781 --> 01:10:44,810
The boys was so hot that aluminum wheels
melted.

1230
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,083
It burned.
It burned in paradise up north of 

1231
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,960
142,000
acres.

1232
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:57,280
I have no way to fathom what that means,
but I have some videos I want to show of

1233
01:10:58,881 --> 01:11:03,881
kind of some of these people survived 
and were unharmed and we had the,

1234
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:08,840
there woolsey fire going on in our area 
and that one seemed crazy.

1235
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,960
And then once we heard the numbers of 
the one in the north,

1236
01:11:11,961 --> 01:11:12,830
it's like,
oh my,

1237
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,800
it was way worse.
Destruction there was unbelievable.

1238
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,280
I think here,
because La is so densely populated,

1239
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:25,550
the evacuation here was way crazier.
There was a hundred and 70,000

1240
01:11:25,801 --> 01:11:30,120
people who were under mandatory 
evacuation.

1241
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:32,103
Um,

1242
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:38,090
there were 600 structures destroyed and 
a three fatalities and this fire and the

1243
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:42,330
one in La and Ventura County.

1244
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:44,013
Um,

1245
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:48,690
I want to show some some footage again,
all these people that were more.

1246
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:49,883
Well here,
that's,

1247
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,753
that's what it was.
According to the stats I have in front 

1248
01:11:52,951 --> 01:11:54,360
of me,
correct me if I'm wrong.

1249
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:56,760
Then those were,
uh,

1250
01:11:56,761 --> 01:12:00,960
I pulled that from CBS News and they 
published it around noon today.

1251
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:04,620
So it's about as up to date.
Let me see here.

1252
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:07,230
So this is,
this stuff is,

1253
01:12:07,231 --> 01:12:10,320
so it's like out of a movie,
like I can't believe this stuff.

1254
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:12,240
How does that fall for you,
Dan?

1255
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:13,740
Is that okay?
Yeah.

1256
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:14,730
Perfect.
Right.

1257
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,460
So this is just,
where was this from?

1258
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,680
The,
this is the Paradise Campfire,

1259
01:12:19,681 --> 01:12:22,890
the one up north.
So you can imagine like,

1260
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,170
describe it for the,
uh,

1261
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:25,590
cell.
It's that guy.

1262
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:30,990
Thank you Dan for reminding me.
So this is a guy driving down a road and

1263
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,730
I mean it's hell fire.
She's hell.

1264
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:37,170
Fire up in hell.
Fire on both sides.

1265
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,063
Amber,
when smoke and it's the highway to hell 

1266
01:12:42,181 --> 01:12:44,340
man.
And this fire was so,

1267
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:45,683
like I said,
spread so fast and so furiously because 

1268
01:12:47,761 --> 01:12:49,750
it was so windy all of a sudden.
Yeah.

1269
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:53,150
The Santa Ana winds,
which is like pressure from hot.

1270
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,510
I don't know how the science works,
would,

1271
01:12:54,511 --> 01:12:55,344
it gets really windy and really dry and 
so this guy could very well just be at 

1272
01:12:59,701 --> 01:13:00,534
home not knowing anything is going on 
and then all of a sudden he's trying to 

1273
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:04,740
escape.
And here this is what it looks like.

1274
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,990
You can only imagine how hot it would be
in that car.

1275
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:13,830
A lot of people have met their end when 
from the car.

1276
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:16,800
Literally.
That's so horrible.

1277
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:17,843
So this is one look here,
retard can also just stop at any moment 

1278
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:25,570
because of the lack of oxygen.
It like turns off and you get,

1279
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,500
you're just stuck there.
Yeah.

1280
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:30,170
Um,
that's all fine.

1281
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,160
Really horrifying.

1282
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:35,613
Um,

1283
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:38,950
well also trees could fall on the road.
I mean,

1284
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,540
I never thought of lack of oxygen.
No,

1285
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:44,500
that's crazy.
I don't know which one.

1286
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:45,970
Oh,
I think this was from Canaan.

1287
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,833
This is right in hills and move.
Drove up and down this road a million 

1288
01:13:51,221 --> 01:13:55,870
times.
So how does that frame up?

1289
01:13:55,871 --> 01:13:57,300
That's okay.
Yeah,

1290
01:13:57,310 --> 01:13:58,143
looks good.
She's driving what is usually a really 

1291
01:14:02,411 --> 01:14:05,590
beautiful and scenic road down to the 
beach,

1292
01:14:05,591 --> 01:14:09,490
down to Malibu and it's just.
Oh yeah,

1293
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:12,730
that's the Canon tunnel that drive some 
of the time.

1294
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,653
So she's going through a tunnel on the 
ground and as she emerges on the other 

1295
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:19,900
side,
you can see the amber red go low stretch

1296
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:20,734
through a merge.
She comes out of the tunnel and it's 

1297
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,023
just like,

1298
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,253
that's such a scary drive to do it in 
such a time because it's like you drive 

1299
01:14:30,711 --> 01:14:31,570
to the mountains.

1300
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,480
There's already they started going to 
them.

1301
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:37,620
Yeah.
Oh my God.

1302
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:40,783
My.

1303
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:43,853
It's just smoke and fire.
Amber asked the visibility's lift one 

1304
01:14:46,201 --> 01:14:49,470
foot.
You're going to hear the.

1305
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:51,970
You can hear the crackling.
Wow.

1306
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:53,873
How the hell did she record this?
That blows my mind that she was able to 

1307
01:14:58,681 --> 01:15:00,570
drive and recording the wheel,
you know,

1308
01:15:00,571 --> 01:15:03,150
and got her phone in the same hand.
I mean,

1309
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,153
um,
and then so it looks like she's out 

1310
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:06,623
because she's in another tunnel and 
she's coming out and then once again on 

1311
01:15:10,231 --> 01:15:11,064
the other side of the tunnel,
it's just endless fire and ash and 

1312
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:17,520
smoke.
She opens the window.

1313
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:18,413
You hear that

1314
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:37,340
that is the worst road to be on at this 
time.

1315
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,353
So,
so scary driving on a regular because 

1316
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:44,210
it's so twist and turn and mountains.
And

1317
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:49,120
I'm amazed that she was able to record 
this.

1318
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:51,010
I mean,
how can you.

1319
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,270
Yeah.
I haven't watched if,

1320
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:03,030
but yeah,
that's what she makes her.

1321
01:16:03,031 --> 01:16:03,990
Right?
She's fine.

1322
01:16:03,991 --> 01:16:08,520
I saw an interview with her afterwards.
She's laughing about the experience.

1323
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:09,570
She's totally fine.

1324
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:10,823
Okay.

1325
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,830
But I,
I don't wish that experience on anyone.

1326
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:16,650
I mean that is so terrifying.
Um,

1327
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:19,770
but my God,
she is a hero for.

1328
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,750
I mean,
imagine you're driving for your life and

1329
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:23,550
holding a phone,
recording it on one hand.

1330
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:25,803
That's something she needs to be like a 
professional camera lady or something 

1331
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,150
because she's got it.
She's got potential.

1332
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,370
Yeah,
incredible stuff.

1333
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,540
Canaan is a landmark in Los Angeles,
is beautiful,

1334
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:42,300
really beautiful canyon road that goes 
down to Malibu beach.

1335
01:16:42,301 --> 01:16:47,301
So it's weird to think of it from a 
beautiful scenic route too.

1336
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:54,630
A hell fire.
So there's more yet.

1337
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,920
Um,
we'll have we here.

1338
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,690
Uh,
I just thought this was so crazy.

1339
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:05,220
Here you can see that the freeway full 
of cars,

1340
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:06,563
fire creeping up the side of the cliff 
and then a helicopter dumping water on 

1341
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:14,810
the freeway as cars are still on the 
freeway.

1342
01:17:14,811 --> 01:17:15,644
I mean the fire spread so fast.
They didn't even have time to shut down 

1343
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:21,210
the freeway and evacuated.
So you can see these people.

1344
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:24,430
You'll see I'm playing.
It's unbelievable.

1345
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,390
I mean,
that's crazy.

1346
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,313
Look at this.
Helicopter is literally dropping water 

1347
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:31,683
on cars on the freeway.
I think if we're going to stay from 

1348
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:38,954
getting hammered,
we probably want to imagine being in 

1349
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:41,570
that car.
You're just like,

1350
01:17:41,571 --> 01:17:42,404
whoa.
Right.

1351
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,590
And the worst part is that people are 
stopping the look.

1352
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:50,030
So there's traffic like stop and go 
traffic or right next to the fire.

1353
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:52,990
Why would you stop?
Would you stop?

1354
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:56,840
It's good.
I think it looks like what you see this.

1355
01:17:56,841 --> 01:18:00,560
They're all,
they're all right next to the fire.

1356
01:18:00,561 --> 01:18:01,820
Just stop and go traffic.

1357
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,110
It's just because they've always done 
the.

1358
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,170
Yeah,
right there.

1359
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:15,240
Who that is so fucking scary.
But that's just a testament.

1360
01:18:15,241 --> 01:18:18,330
Thou fastest thing.
A spread.

1361
01:18:18,331 --> 01:18:21,210
Like look at this just on the fricken 
freeway.

1362
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,780
Oh my God.
You have a guy actually splashed,

1363
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,880
drifted.
He could see where it was going to drift

1364
01:18:26,881 --> 01:18:29,340
because of the wind.
Crazy.

1365
01:18:29,341 --> 01:18:34,341
Huh?
And I do want to say I was up at 5:00

1366
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:35,673
AM the night that it broke.
And these firefighters are freaking 

1367
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:39,423
amazing.
Like being a firefighter in California 

1368
01:18:41,831 --> 01:18:45,550
or any firefighters are amazing.
I have a lot of respect for firefighters

1369
01:18:45,551 --> 01:18:49,690
in general,
but these guys were grinding it out.

1370
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:50,703
Five am,
I'm raging and Friday and they're out 

1371
01:18:55,721 --> 01:18:57,350
there.
Uh,

1372
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,060
all Doug,
24 hours just fighting this shit.

1373
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:03,190
I had an,
an,

1374
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:04,023
a profound appreciation for them.
And there was a lot of police involved 

1375
01:19:08,261 --> 01:19:09,100
and a lot of

1376
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,040
I saw a clip of,
and dude I know they say you're supposed

1377
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:15,590
to evacuate and everything,
but I saw a dude,

1378
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,713
he had like a,
it looked like a pretty poor house and 

1379
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:23,810
you'd like a farm and animals and shit 
and his whole neighborhood.

1380
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:27,490
I was watching this live last night,
not last night when it was happening and

1381
01:19:27,491 --> 01:19:30,560
his whole neighborhood was engulfed in 
flames and the dude is just there with a

1382
01:19:30,561 --> 01:19:35,561
garden hose putting out ambers and it 
looked like he saved his house man.

1383
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:40,850
I mean he was just there with a fricking
garden hose,

1384
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:45,851
like against this force of nature.
So I'm a huge respect for these fricking

1385
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:52,550
amazing people out there.
And even now the fire is still going,

1386
01:19:52,551 --> 01:19:54,130
you know,
I don't know.

1387
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,480
It's still,
it's still I,

1388
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,870
I could be wrong band.
It's like what?

1389
01:19:56,871 --> 01:20:01,871
Sixty contained or something.
The one close to us.

1390
01:20:03,111 --> 01:20:03,741
And uh,
yeah,

1391
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:06,560
I mean the one up north is still raging 
as well.

1392
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:08,100
So that's what you,

1393
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,933
it's hard to appreciate it.
Like now the kind of the dust has 

1394
01:20:11,191 --> 01:20:12,024
settled in the city as fires still 
raging on and these guys are still 

1395
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:16,824
fighting it.
I just can't imagine that moment you 

1396
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:23,900
come back to your house and it's gone.
Where do you start in?

1397
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:25,750
Okay.

1398
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,020
It just look it up.
Was he fired?

1399
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:29,330
That is 70 percent contained.
Uh,

1400
01:20:29,331 --> 01:20:30,980
the one up north,
the campfire.

1401
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:34,220
A only 45 percent contain still.
Gosh,

1402
01:20:34,221 --> 01:20:35,054
Gee Whiz.

1403
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:43,550
Um,
many really luxurious,

1404
01:20:43,621 --> 01:20:46,970
huge,
expensive houses burned down la,

1405
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:52,500
like architecture and art and um,
and whatnot.

1406
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,360
Like crazy.
I heard that.

1407
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,213
I hadn't heard if uh,
if it had been confirmed whether or not 

1408
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,160
his house survived,
but the director,

1409
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,580
Guillermo del Toro,
which you'll,

1410
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:07,320
I know you're a huge fan of guy,
but he,

1411
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:09,570
he has a,
a huge,

1412
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,433
uh,
he has a huge private collection of 

1413
01:21:12,211 --> 01:21:15,480
artwork from a lot of really famous 
artists that in his house.

1414
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:18,060
And last thing I thought about when I 
heard about all day,

1415
01:21:18,061 --> 01:21:20,130
like I think it burnt.
I think I heard of Brian,

1416
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:21,920
did he not?
That's me.

1417
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,910
That's crazy.
Because he had,

1418
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,810
he had a bunch of really awesome pieces.
I might be wrong about that.

1419
01:21:27,811 --> 01:21:29,430
Maybe you guys can fact check that.
I'm curious.

1420
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,031
I'm gonna.
Look it up.

1421
01:21:30,031 --> 01:21:30,750
Yeah,
I know.

1422
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:32,340
That was like,
as of a day or two,

1423
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:34,260
it's only minor smoke damage.

1424
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:35,983
Okay.
You miley cyrus lost or have a lot of 

1425
01:21:40,051 --> 01:21:40,884
super rich people,
which is good in a way that because 

1426
01:21:42,871 --> 01:21:45,830
these are people that can take it,
but on the other good,

1427
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,440
but they can.
Well there their lives are not ruined,

1428
01:21:49,441 --> 01:21:50,274
but that's not to dismiss the suffering 
that they'll surely endure from losing 

1429
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,720
all of their worldly belongings.
Horrible.

1430
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,080
Yeah.
Can you imagine?

1431
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,073
Um,
and Kanya Kanya hired private 

1432
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:10,570
firefighters to watch his house and 
protect his house,

1433
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:11,733
which was interesting.
God bless him in his neighbors to 

1434
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:18,490
evidently which,
which is the neighbors were thankful for

1435
01:22:18,491 --> 01:22:20,900
him,
but it was his own.

1436
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,400
Yeah,
that's what I meant is that he,

1437
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:26,890
he not just to protect us but to protect
his whole neighborhood.

1438
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,770
Yeah.
I didn't know you could do that,

1439
01:22:28,771 --> 01:22:33,300
but I mean that's a little private 
firefighters.

1440
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,510
I don't know.
That seems 30 old thing.

1441
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:38,700
There was saying his house is worth $6 
million.

1442
01:22:38,701 --> 01:22:41,430
So I think when you have found much to 
protect,

1443
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:44,820
well you're saying,
you're saying what other people's houses

1444
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:46,540
are burning.
Well,

1445
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:47,510
it's just,
you know,

1446
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,730
you can't afford the private 
firefighters see your house burns.

1447
01:22:50,731 --> 01:22:52,110
Is that really fair?
I mean,

1448
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:53,163
uh,
well world isn't fair and army of 

1449
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,640
firefighters.
Goddammit.

1450
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:59,820
You go for it apparently though,
saved this whole neighborhood.

1451
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,571
Yeah.
Yeah.

1452
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:01,090
No,
that's.

1453
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:01,923
I mean that is good.
That probably helped the firefighters a 

1454
01:23:03,331 --> 01:23:05,230
lot because they didn't have to come.
That's true.

1455
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,040
Fucking waste

1456
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,873
resources on.

1457
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:09,340
I guess my thought is just how these 
private firefighters,

1458
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:11,300
if nobody pays them,
do they just stay at home?

1459
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:12,860
And I'm like,
well I'm in bed.

1460
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:17,910
They're probably not necessarily 
firefighters just like I'm right now.

1461
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:20,810
It's probably like ex military kind of,
you know.

1462
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,140
But uh,
I had the same.

1463
01:23:23,141 --> 01:23:26,140
I had the same.
It does sound weird.

1464
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:29,190
I'm trying not to be cynical about it 
because my first impression was like,

1465
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,030
uh,
no.

1466
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:32,740
Yeah,
exactly what,

1467
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:35,170
you must be nice.
But on the other hand it's like,

1468
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,670
you know what,
if you got the money,

1469
01:23:36,671 --> 01:23:38,170
if you got,
if you've got it,

1470
01:23:38,171 --> 01:23:40,030
flaunt it.
Oh for sure.

1471
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:42,460
I don't blame Kanye for doing it.
Hell yeah,

1472
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:43,323
but I,
I bet you in the end it probably did 

1473
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:46,970
help the firefighters a lot because they
don't have to worry about saving that.

1474
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:51,180
He's like,
start with my house.

1475
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:54,390
But then you know,
help other people if you can,

1476
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,513
you know,
I got to say I don't like talking about 

1477
01:23:58,901 --> 01:23:59,734
politics and I don't like talking about 
trump and I'm not a forest ranger 

1478
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,353
obviously,
so I don't know how to analyze this 

1479
01:24:08,051 --> 01:24:08,990
statement,
a,

1480
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:13,010
the validity of it.
But trump's first response and,

1481
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:17,950
and as someone that lives here,
I want to read this to you,

1482
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,353
there is no reason for these massive 
deadly and costly forest fires in 

1483
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:23,050
California.
Oh,

1484
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:25,990
thank you.
There is no reason is this better?

1485
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,453
Much better.
There's no reason for these massive 

1486
01:24:28,961 --> 01:24:32,320
deadly and costly forest fires in 
California except that forest management

1487
01:24:32,321 --> 01:24:33,154
is so poor.
Billions of dollars that are given each 

1488
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:35,943
year with so many lives lost all because
of gross mismanagement of the forest 

1489
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,620
remedy now,
or no more federal payments.

1490
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:42,993
This was his first statement.
He did end up saying a lot of Nice 

1491
01:24:44,981 --> 01:24:47,820
things and encouraging stuff,
but you know,

1492
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:48,663
again,
I'm not a park ranger so I can't assess 

1493
01:24:51,641 --> 01:24:53,590
his statements.
Uh,

1494
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:57,360
all of that might be completely and 
perfectly valid.

1495
01:24:57,361 --> 01:25:01,710
Right up to that last sentence where you
suddenly threatened pulling funding,

1496
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:02,573
like,
you know,

1497
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:07,110
have that fight after work where we've 
stopped the fires maybe.

1498
01:25:07,111 --> 01:25:07,810
Sure.

1499
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:08,250
Yeah.
My,

1500
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:10,000
my,
my problem was just like,

1501
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:12,690
as someone that lives here is like,
I dunno,

1502
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:16,030
I feel like the world needs a little 
more tenderness,

1503
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:19,510
more compact,
a little more compassion right now.

1504
01:25:19,511 --> 01:25:22,740
And especially in these times when we're
so divided and everything.

1505
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:23,603
So political and I don't know,
I just felt disappointed that our 

1506
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:31,831
president was making a political point 
or using it to make a point or to attack

1507
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:34,800
people when people's houses were still 
borrowing the bore.

1508
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:37,840
Dying and fires.
I was just like,

1509
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:38,441
man,
I mean,

1510
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:39,640
you,
you might be right.

1511
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:43,030
I'm not even going to get until trying 
to analyze who's right and who's wrong,

1512
01:25:43,031 --> 01:25:43,864
but I just wish that there was more 
fricking tenderness and compassion and 

1513
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,720
the planet for each other.

1514
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:51,041
Right?
Yeah.

1515
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:51,874
I mean,
if there may be a lot of validity to 

1516
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:57,400
what he's saying about mismanagement and
you know,

1517
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:00,970
things that can prevent it,
but when it's an ongoing disaster,

1518
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,833
it's not,
it's not over like people are still 

1519
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:04,010
dying and it's

1520
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,843
like,
just,

1521
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,840
you know,
next month,

1522
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,030
let's talk about that.
Let's talk about what we can do better.

1523
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:13,760
And Donald trump really is a role model 
for a lot of people,

1524
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:19,220
a lot of people look up to and the 
ambulance came and I just think,

1525
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:22,423
I dunno,
it'd be nice to see more compassionate 

1526
01:26:23,601 --> 01:26:27,110
in the world unless of whatever this is.
That's all.

1527
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:29,563
And so I thought it was relevant,
just a little disappointed by buyer 

1528
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:35,000
leader.
I mean he's,

1529
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:37,820
he leads all of us,
not just his base.

1530
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,163
He's still the president of California 
even though Californians hate him in 

1531
01:26:43,611 --> 01:26:44,444
general.

1532
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,433
So

1533
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:48,960
yeah.
Um,

1534
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:52,023
I definitely am going to donate to 
support the people that have been 

1535
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:55,834
affected by this.
I was trying to research the best place 

1536
01:26:57,851 --> 01:27:00,520
to do it.
The mayor of Sacramento,

1537
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:05,521
which is the capital of California and 
just south of um,

1538
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:09,790
this really incredible fire up north,

1539
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:12,523
um,

1540
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,180
straight from the horse's mouth.
Is that derogatory?

1541
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:17,043
Is that a relevant thing?
The horse's mouth gets horses shit 

1542
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:25,900
straight from the mayor's mouth.
If you want to help the victims,

1543
01:27:25,901 --> 01:27:29,860
please don't send supplies as the 
evacuation center.

1544
01:27:29,861 --> 01:27:30,694
Say they have been in undated.
Those working on the front line and say 

1545
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:38,791
that giving to the Red Cross or habitat 
a.org

1546
01:27:38,801 --> 01:27:39,634
is the best way to help.
So these are some good recommendations 

1547
01:27:43,511 --> 01:27:44,344
from someone directly involved in this 
to give you some ideas if you want to 

1548
01:27:47,621 --> 01:27:50,200
help.
I'm definitely going to donate myself.

1549
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:55,810
So there you go.
I've just feel awful for everyone.

1550
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:58,080
Yeah,
it's just,

1551
01:27:58,110 --> 01:27:59,060
it's just,
uh,

1552
01:27:59,180 --> 01:27:59,960
you know,
this,

1553
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,380
this thing going on a coffee.
These wildfires are just.

1554
01:28:02,381 --> 01:28:04,990
So they've gotten so out of control 
every season.

1555
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:08,680
I was watching a documentary on Netflix 
that was really interesting about it,

1556
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,440
about the guy who's been following.

1557
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:13,630
I forget the name of it.
Maybe you can look it up for me when you

1558
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,473
guys and out.
It's about a documentary crew that 

1559
01:28:16,511 --> 01:28:17,344
follows firefighters over the course of 
like a whole fire season and the 

1560
01:28:21,641 --> 01:28:24,280
firefighters are saying that in the past
like 10,

1561
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:25,473
15 years,
it's been getting progressively worse 

1562
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:28,893
and the season's been getting longer 
because there's the change in weather 

1563
01:28:33,401 --> 01:28:34,234
and the changing climate has a produced 
the less rain in California and so 

1564
01:28:39,401 --> 01:28:44,401
everything's more dry and it's just 
making the fire is way worse.

1565
01:28:45,311 --> 01:28:46,144
There's a lot of dead trees.
There's a lot of dry trees and 

1566
01:28:49,211 --> 01:28:50,950
California,
a ton of wilderness.

1567
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:52,583
Um,
so it's incense from due to the change 

1568
01:28:57,401 --> 01:29:00,520
in weather.
Just a huge matchbox,

1569
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:03,170
just a huge,
uh,

1570
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:07,140
so every season like this,
this one now la.

1571
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:08,250
Yeah,
fire chasers.

1572
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:09,360
Thank you Dan.
On netflix.

1573
01:29:09,361 --> 01:29:11,040
It was really captivating.
Watch.

1574
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:13,530
I gotta watch it.
Incredible footage.

1575
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:18,030
Last year the one in Ventura was the 
worst in history.

1576
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:21,630
It was the most destructive in 
California history.

1577
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:22,583
And now this year the one up north beat 
that record already and it's still 

1578
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:29,590
burning Ventura county.
I don't know what's going on.

1579
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:30,490
Those poor guys,
man.

1580
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:33,580
I'm from Ventura originally.
They're just getting crushed.

1581
01:29:33,581 --> 01:29:34,414
Man.
I feel so bad for them to fires 

1582
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:37,143
shooting.
They had that shooting and the next 

1583
01:29:39,911 --> 01:29:43,630
night before they can even mourn for the
loss of like 11 lives.

1584
01:29:43,631 --> 01:29:47,290
I think it was 12 lines that,
uh,

1585
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:50,080
the,
the fricking counties on fire,

1586
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:53,500
same people that needed to more and had 
to evacuate.

1587
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:54,423
Exactly,

1588
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:56,343
man.

1589
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,393
Rough.
Probably if I had the guests are a 

1590
01:30:00,791 --> 01:30:05,550
result of all the gay people bringing 
the wrath of God.

1591
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,210
I like this.
No,

1592
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:09,273
there's,
there's like all these preachers that 

1593
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:14,220
say all the fires and everything bad 
happening in the world is because of gay

1594
01:30:14,221 --> 01:30:15,970
people.
I swear to God,

1595
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:19,770
go Westborough Westborough.
I mean people like,

1596
01:30:19,771 --> 01:30:20,604
um,

1597
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,670
more reputable than that.
Like people with actual.

1598
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:29,560
I'd have to look into the specifics of 
it because I don't want to say anything.

1599
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,560
Not True,
but I've seen lots of clips of preachers

1600
01:30:32,561 --> 01:30:33,560
being like,
oh,

1601
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:38,300
all the fires out here in California is 
because of the gays.

1602
01:30:39,950 --> 01:30:41,020
Eh?
You know,

1603
01:30:41,021 --> 01:30:43,660
when you rub dicks together,
what do you expect to happen?

1604
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:48,810
When you rub two sticks together,
it causes more than just semen to erupt.

1605
01:30:48,811 --> 01:30:53,811
It causes sparks like sticks,
two sticks rubbing together.

1606
01:30:54,401 --> 01:30:55,330
God said,
no.

1607
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:00,010
I rub two big sticks and a whole fire 
burned estate down.

1608
01:31:00,011 --> 01:31:02,620
If that ain't the got gazed and I don't 
know what it is.

1609
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:09,870
That's why God says use Lube,
because if you rubbed Dick Dry,

1610
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:12,030
you could burn the whole state.
Oh,

1611
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:14,070
that's a good point.
We're talking about.

1612
01:31:14,071 --> 01:31:15,630
I said something.
Oh,

1613
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,060
Ilos got where it is.
Pastor.

1614
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:20,160
Blame scalpel all over this.
Let's see.

1615
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:25,440
A pasture blames California offers on 
states embrace me of Lgbtq Center.

1616
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:28,343
A reasonable stance right there.
Now trump says that it's because of the 

1617
01:31:32,251 --> 01:31:36,030
poor forest management and the liberal 
ses because of climate change,

1618
01:31:36,031 --> 01:31:36,864
but I have an alternate theory that it's
a that gaze when two men rob dix 

1619
01:31:45,631 --> 01:31:48,060
together,
it can cause more than just ejaculate

1620
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:52,900
known for inflammatory claims.
A pasture.

1621
01:31:52,901 --> 01:31:53,734
Kevin Swanson,
a little subtle upon their inflammatory 

1622
01:31:57,101 --> 01:32:00,340
claims.
Maybe it is a little fun with it.

1623
01:32:00,341 --> 01:32:01,560
Yeah.
Pasture.

1624
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:02,403
Kevin Swanson is drawing a link between 
California's devastating wildfires and 

1625
01:32:06,191 --> 01:32:09,070
the states embrace of same sex 
marriages.

1626
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:11,620
Well,
it sounds foolproof.

1627
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:17,720
Wrap it up with God's punishment of the 
Golden State for legitimizing the sin of

1628
01:32:19,571 --> 01:32:20,404
homosexuality.
Imagine being God and you hate gay 

1629
01:32:21,611 --> 01:32:22,444
people that much.
The Gay God must be really closeted or 

1630
01:32:27,071 --> 01:32:29,290
something because he hates gays like way
too much.

1631
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:34,270
The first gay pride March occurred in 
San Francisco in 1970,

1632
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:38,020
and then San Francisco legitimize 
homosexuality in 1972.

1633
01:32:38,021 --> 01:32:38,854
He said in 2005 California state 
legislators became the first state in 

1634
01:32:42,551 --> 01:32:44,530
the nation to pass the same sex marriage
law.

1635
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,300
Two thousand 18.
Well,

1636
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:50,640
okay,
you got to have to draw more correlation

1637
01:32:50,641 --> 01:32:55,080
than that.
What is Jim Baker's?

1638
01:32:55,081 --> 01:33:00,081
Zach priest was similar views.
Other one.

1639
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:01,993
You guys find a video.
I want to watch a video of one of these 

1640
01:33:03,391 --> 01:33:04,224
guys.
Sure.

1641
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:06,323
Now,
now a lot of people say that climate 

1642
01:33:10,561 --> 01:33:11,394
change is making the state dry,
but what I say is that it's drag 

1643
01:33:14,551 --> 01:33:19,551
butthole that's causing a fires.
What I say is that the gay people,

1644
01:33:19,741 --> 01:33:23,370
I haven't way too much fun and it's 
causing all these Dang fys.

1645
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:29,350
Please donate to my church because I 
needed another private jet.

1646
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,240
Uh,
what else we got here?

1647
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:38,290
Folks?
We got,

1648
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:42,310
um,
what the F we got,

1649
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:46,840
men with beards are more attractive than
those who are clean shaven,

1650
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:52,060
really real.
And who study finds hung.

1651
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:54,670
Dan,
have you found that to be the case?

1652
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:58,490
You seem shocked by that.
Well,

1653
01:33:58,530 --> 01:33:59,363
you know,
all of us as having a beard that helps 

1654
01:34:02,291 --> 01:34:04,960
you.
There are statistical outliers I guess.

1655
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:07,060
Well,
just imagine how bad,

1656
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:10,870
how rough it'd be if you were shaving.
Well,

1657
01:34:10,871 --> 01:34:12,160
that's true.
That's a good point.

1658
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:13,630
I mean,
have you gone,

1659
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:15,320
have you been beard lists?
Uh,

1660
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:19,390
in the past and uh,
to be honest,

1661
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:23,980
very rarely,
not since I was a teenager.

1662
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:24,814
Basically I've,
I've had a beard while I was 

1663
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:26,983
continuously.
I've had a beard pretty much since I 

1664
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:31,383
could.
And I'll tell you that when I clean 

1665
01:34:33,641 --> 01:34:36,390
shave I feel like a monster.
I feel good.

1666
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:41,620
I also really like,
if you'll come to kiss me or something,

1667
01:34:41,621 --> 01:34:44,980
it feels horrible too.
You don't want your perfectly,

1668
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:47,830
it becomes like sandpaper.
I hate it,

1669
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,850
but the thing,
I think the real ticket from it,

1670
01:34:51,851 --> 01:34:54,220
well this guy's handsome as fuck with or
without a beard.

1671
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:55,930
So I mean,
you know,

1672
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:57,980
a guy like me on be like,

1673
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,350
here he is with no like,
but for me personally,

1674
01:35:01,410 --> 01:35:05,150
they did a study and they showed how 
much are you likely to want to fuck this

1675
01:35:05,151 --> 01:35:08,750
guy?
They just showed people probably,

1676
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:10,160
you know,
random guys.

1677
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:13,580
But I do think in my case,
the beard,

1678
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:17,630
it just hides my face and I'm going to 
be honest and it's fine.

1679
01:35:17,631 --> 01:35:19,820
I'm not that insecure about how ugly I 
am.

1680
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,480
That is one thing I'm comfortable with.
But if you criticize me I'll shut down.

1681
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:26,023
But um,

1682
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:27,920
I don't know if that's what it is.

1683
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:29,470
Covers my face.
I to,

1684
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:31,260
I,
my details are not that good.

1685
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:35,880
I've got a tiny chin.
I've got chubby cheeks.

1686
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,190
Everything going on here is not 
beautiful.

1687
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:39,024
Chiseled.
I don't look like superman or wherever 

1688
01:35:40,051 --> 01:35:40,884
this ass.
That's the 50 shades covered as much as 

1689
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,580
possible.
You can see my nose,

1690
01:35:44,581 --> 01:35:45,660
my eyes,
my eyebrows.

1691
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:46,740
That's okay.

1692
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,900
I don't know if that's what it is,
but I agree with the.

1693
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:53,573
Went to stay with the premise of this.
Don't you think I look better with a 

1694
01:35:56,191 --> 01:35:57,070
beard?
Yeah.

1695
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,490
And it looks horrified when I shave.
No,

1696
01:35:59,491 --> 01:36:01,040
I think that about everybody.
No,

1697
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,930
I think I do think that it looks better 
not,

1698
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:07,980
and I don't like a longer beard though,
that I know there's a certain point.

1699
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:08,963
Well,
that's actually what the study found to 

1700
01:36:09,511 --> 01:36:10,021
right,
that,

1701
01:36:10,021 --> 01:36:11,140
uh,
they,

1702
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:12,730
they check about that.
I will.

1703
01:36:12,731 --> 01:36:13,540
Let me,
let me read.

1704
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:14,161
There's,
there's,

1705
01:36:14,161 --> 01:36:16,470
there's four tiers.
There's like clean shaven,

1706
01:36:16,530 --> 01:36:18,810
a little bit of stubble,
a decent amount of stubble.

1707
01:36:18,811 --> 01:36:21,480
And then like a full beard and the 
decent amount of stubble,

1708
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:23,220
which I think was 10 days.
No shaving.

1709
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:26,830
That was the sexiness.
Let me read this for you guys.

1710
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,010
Men who have full beards are seen as 
more attractive than men who have just a

1711
01:36:31,011 --> 01:36:34,880
light stubble according to results of a 
new study that don't say what this study

1712
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:35,714
is.
So I don't know if it's a reputable in 

1713
01:36:36,921 --> 01:36:38,990
any way,
but it makes sense.

1714
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,093
Researchers found the widely celebrated 
attractiveness of bearded stars like 

1715
01:36:43,851 --> 01:36:47,060
Jamie Dorman,
Jake Gyllenhaal,

1716
01:36:47,061 --> 01:36:49,670
and Chris Hemsworth is apparently no 
coincidence.

1717
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,480
Doesn't hurt that they're incredibly 
handsome as well.

1718
01:36:53,481 --> 01:36:54,314
Exactly.
The most beautiful men in the world are 

1719
01:36:56,421 --> 01:36:57,254
found a track,
although could that be a cultural 

1720
01:36:59,601 --> 01:37:01,160
phenomenon because I feel like in the 
fifties,

1721
01:37:01,161 --> 01:37:04,220
having a beard was seen as kind of a 
trend.

1722
01:37:04,221 --> 01:37:05,070
Right now.
You know,

1723
01:37:05,110 --> 01:37:05,943
I think it's a beards are.
That's kind of like a new thing to come 

1724
01:37:08,271 --> 01:37:10,360
back if I,
if I'm not mistaken,

1725
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:11,203
you know,
it definitely became like super hipster 

1726
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:16,430
guy with the long beard to buy like 
beard oils.

1727
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:22,510
Let's see.
As part of the experiment,

1728
01:37:22,511 --> 01:37:26,770
Male subjects were photographed clean 
shaven five days after shaving 10 days,

1729
01:37:26,771 --> 01:37:31,771
and then after a whole four weeks 
without shaving a 8,500

1730
01:37:31,901 --> 01:37:35,140
women were asked to rate them in on 
attractiveness

1731
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:37,343
as a longterm romantic partner.
Heavy stubble 10 days was found most 

1732
01:37:40,591 --> 01:37:41,424
attractive while fold.
Beard's grown over four weeks came 

1733
01:37:44,671 --> 01:37:45,660
second.
Oh Wow.

1734
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:46,523
They like the full even more than the 
light stubble stubble was third while 

1735
01:37:50,791 --> 01:37:53,490
clean shaven was ranked the least 
attractive.

1736
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,130
Margaret.
No.

1737
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:56,243
Shaving is so annoying.
I hate shaving to the skin on my face 

1738
01:37:59,431 --> 01:38:01,770
and a lot because it irritates your 
skin.

1739
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,860
I feel like that's part of why I don't 
like it too,

1740
01:38:04,861 --> 01:38:08,140
because I know that it's,
it doesn't look comfortable.

1741
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,170
I like,
like you shaved your legs.

1742
01:38:10,171 --> 01:38:11,670
Imagine doing on your face.
I mean,

1743
01:38:11,671 --> 01:38:16,410
Geez Louise.
I'd like raising like some parts,

1744
01:38:16,411 --> 01:38:19,470
like my neck and the back.
I use a razor for the back of my neck in

1745
01:38:19,471 --> 01:38:20,850
the shower.
That's changed my life.

1746
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,700
But the,
this is so.

1747
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,480
The reason I grew a beard to begin with 
is because it's so irritable.

1748
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:31,110
I keep getting like pimples and cried 
out and oily.

1749
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:32,690
The whole God damn thing

1750
01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:33,663
river.
Uh,

1751
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:35,063
I know this weird question,
but have you ever had a professional 

1752
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:40,350
shave where they use like a straight 
razor and somebody does it for you?

1753
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:43,290
I don't know that I have Dan.
And that's so strange that you would ask

1754
01:38:43,291 --> 01:38:43,591
that.
No,

1755
01:38:43,591 --> 01:38:44,970
I'm kidding.
That wasn't that weird of a question.

1756
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,670
It's honestly,
I did.

1757
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,050
It was nice.
It was awesome.

1758
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:50,803
And it doesn't irritate you.
I mean that's the biggest thing is the 

1759
01:38:52,561 --> 01:38:57,300
razor is so sharp that it doesn't make 
you break out the way a normal radio.

1760
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,360
I do have a fear during that procedure 
that they're going to slit your neck.

1761
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:01,650
Yeah.
Sweeney todd style.

1762
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:05,730
Just fucking down the rational fear that
they'll just be like,

1763
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:08,550
whoops.
Got Him.

1764
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,860
I was nervous.
It is freaky.

1765
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:11,783
I mean,
I've got a guy with a razor sharp 

1766
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:15,790
utensil to your neck.
It's a.

1767
01:39:15,791 --> 01:39:18,900
it's a little uncomfortable,
but seems nice.

1768
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:25,140
I would go for that.
This article is on Yahoo style blue.com.

1769
01:39:29,150 --> 01:39:29,983
Yeah.

1770
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:35,760
I love all these tech companies trying 
to like exist in the shadow of Google.

1771
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:37,890
Yeah.
Was style.

1772
01:39:39,290 --> 01:39:40,123
Um,
but the research paper concludes that 

1773
01:39:43,261 --> 01:39:47,190
beards consistently render men with an 
older,

1774
01:39:47,191 --> 01:39:51,480
more masculine socially dominant and 
aggressive appearance.

1775
01:39:51,810 --> 01:39:53,610
Oh Damn.
Girls are fucking crazy.

1776
01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:54,923
I want a man that's aggressive and 
dominant beers maybe more attractive to 

1777
01:39:59,311 --> 01:40:01,770
women when considering long term than 
short term relationship.

1778
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,693
I'm looking for a man that's socially 
dominant and aggressive for a longterm 

1779
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:06,263
relationship as they indicate a male's 
ability to sex successfully compete 

1780
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:15,060
socially with other males for resources.
I think you're looking way too much into

1781
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:15,360
this.

1782
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:15,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

1783
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:17,580
That time.
I think it's a fad.

1784
01:40:19,650 --> 01:40:21,750
Of course not everyone can grow a full 
beard.

1785
01:40:21,751 --> 01:40:25,450
It all depends if it suits you.
Okay.

1786
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:26,343
Whatever.
Tell him,

1787
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:27,790
uh,
what else is google style?

1788
01:40:27,791 --> 01:40:28,624
Got To tell me about the word.
Do we have any clips of those crazy 

1789
01:40:36,641 --> 01:40:37,474
preachers?

1790
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,750
I was trying to find this Jim Baker Guy,
um,

1791
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:45,370
but can't seem to find any evidence.
So Jim Baker,

1792
01:40:45,371 --> 01:40:49,030
if we've,
if we've a solid your name unfairly,

1793
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,150
we apologize.
You may or may not

1794
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:54,010
gave people.
Now many think that,

1795
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:55,300
uh,
whatever,

1796
01:40:55,301 --> 01:40:56,134
it's such a stupid.
And even many people think that you 

1797
01:41:00,101 --> 01:41:00,934
don't think I should continue with the 
whole preacher thing or no els hitting 

1798
01:41:06,221 --> 01:41:08,410
the board on that one.
In the crickets.

1799
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:09,040
Yeah.
Okay.

1800
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,300
Hit me with the crickets.
Yeah.

1801
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:15,970
Many people think the blame.
I say being gay is fine.

1802
01:41:17,611 --> 01:41:21,210
Just as long as you lose you loop.
When you rub your sticks together,

1803
01:41:22,630 --> 01:41:26,480
you can hit me with the cricket on you.
Bended.

1804
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:28,600
Tom and Christina were at the thought of
cricket.

1805
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:33,130
They were like,
so they were both had this visceral like

1806
01:41:33,131 --> 01:41:35,620
what?
It's funny too,

1807
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:38,140
because I,
I don't have that problem.

1808
01:41:41,150 --> 01:41:41,981
I know.
It's funny.

1809
01:41:41,981 --> 01:41:42,814
It's amazing to see they both really 
like recoil at the sound of the 

1810
01:41:46,271 --> 01:41:49,120
crickets.
That's amazing.

1811
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:51,520
I love those guys.
They're so freaking awesome,

1812
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:53,230
aren't they?
Yes,

1813
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:57,650
they are.
What else we got here?

1814
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:58,280
Oh,
we got some.

1815
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:01,460
Should we go onto fan submissions?
We're at an hour 45.

1816
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:02,670
Yeah.
It's time.

1817
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:10,290
Uh,
Joshua mccardy says hi.

1818
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:11,124
I'm a big fan of the show and thought I 
would suggest showing this gem of a 

1819
01:42:13,891 --> 01:42:14,724
video.
I'm from eastern Kentucky and my local 

1820
01:42:17,311 --> 01:42:19,350
news station had a segment about a 
robbery.

1821
01:42:19,351 --> 01:42:23,310
I won't say anymore,
but encourage you to watch and enjoy.

1822
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,470
Thank you josh.
Wall for thinking about it.

1823
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,750
Getting some really great clips from.
Yeah.

1824
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:31,950
I want to say guys

1825
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:37,580
keep sending shit to podcasts at h three
h three productions because there's been

1826
01:42:37,581 --> 01:42:40,430
some absolutely great stuff there.
I want everything.

1827
01:42:40,431 --> 01:42:45,431
I want questions you want to advice you 
have any reaction,

1828
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:47,870
any suggestions for a reaction?
Videos you like,

1829
01:42:47,871 --> 01:42:49,820
what you see?
Um,

1830
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:54,760
it always looks good on that.
I was saying when I looked in the mirror

1831
01:42:54,761 --> 01:42:55,481
last time,
I was like,

1832
01:42:55,481 --> 01:42:56,314
damn boy,
I have you turn your head all your hair 

1833
01:42:57,911 --> 01:42:58,630
like that.
No,

1834
01:42:58,630 --> 01:42:59,980
you wouldn't.
No,

1835
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,520
no.
I don't know what you think I could walk

1836
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:08,890
down.
You agreed that it almost looks good.

1837
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:11,830
So what I mean is that it looks like a 
style.

1838
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

1839
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:14,800
I think I could get away with it.
Honestly.

1840
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,240
It's just not.
Not,

1841
01:43:16,241 --> 01:43:17,890
not the side you're showing us right 
now.

1842
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:22,270
Not that one.
And yeah,

1843
01:43:22,271 --> 01:43:24,790
maybe not that.
It looks like you evacuated.

1844
01:43:24,791 --> 01:43:27,940
Well getting a haircut.
It's just not my style.

1845
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:29,373
I'm not,
I'm not.

1846
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:33,490
I'm not slamming the style.
It's just not my style.

1847
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:34,900
Yeah,
that's all.

1848
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:36,310
But I actually,
it was,

1849
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:37,173
I swear to God,
it felt so good to do it all the way 

1850
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:40,660
down.
It's really,

1851
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:43,120
really amazing.
It grows so fast,

1852
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:45,880
so it's already like it was the skin two
days ago.

1853
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:46,803
Yeah.

1854
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,690
Huh.
I wonder if there's a research about the

1855
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,333
hair stubble research found that men 
were more attractive when they weren't 

1856
01:43:56,361 --> 01:43:57,950
completely bald to the skin.

1857
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:02,183
Zach just pointed out,
you actually looked like the dude from 

1858
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:04,860
the dude,
from his Robert Deniro,

1859
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:06,290
from taxi driver.
Yeah,

1860
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:08,930
I know.
We wrote out a bunch of them.

1861
01:44:08,931 --> 01:44:11,260
We had a bunch of hair.
That was one of the insults.

1862
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:12,920
I have my,
we had a,

1863
01:44:12,930 --> 01:44:15,750
I looked like Mr.
Cleans inbred cousin.

1864
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:21,540
And then how do you look like a,
how do you look like a Jew and a Nazi at

1865
01:44:21,541 --> 01:44:23,030
the same time?
Yeah.

1866
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:26,280
But that was really.
And they were,

1867
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:29,210
it looked like it when it was super 
skinhead.

1868
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:31,470
Um,
we had a lot more.

1869
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:33,840
Um,
you look like a

1870
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:38,270
definitely taxi driver reference at the 
end there.

1871
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:39,253
God torturing people.
People are going to be demanding this 

1872
01:44:40,401 --> 01:44:42,710
video now.
In the end it was really bad.

1873
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:44,780
You're not missing anything folks.
The haircuts,

1874
01:44:44,781 --> 01:44:47,600
the best part.
You're getting all the good names.

1875
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:48,651
Um,
what else?

1876
01:44:48,651 --> 01:44:49,550
There were so many.
Let me just,

1877
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:51,530
I'm going to look like where we got 
nothing to do.

1878
01:44:51,531 --> 01:44:54,570
We're at the end of this video.
Our fans.

1879
01:44:54,810 --> 01:44:55,960
We have this video.
No,

1880
01:44:55,970 --> 01:44:57,020
I'm going to wash that.
I just,

1881
01:44:57,021 --> 01:44:59,030
I want to at least,
uh,

1882
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:03,230
enjoy.
What little jokes I want to salvage,

1883
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:04,064
whatever I can from this.
There wasn't much more than what we 

1884
01:45:06,441 --> 01:45:07,550
said.
Let's see.

1885
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:10,130
Uh,
you look like a 90 villain extra.

1886
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:12,550
Yeah.
A little bit.

1887
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:15,620
Those were all meant for me to say to 
you look like a dollar store.

1888
01:45:15,630 --> 01:45:17,360
Zurich from Fifth Element.

1889
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:27,020
I think my favorite is how do you look 
like a Jew and skin at the same time.

1890
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:28,570
And Mr.
Cleans inbred cousins.

1891
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:30,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

1892
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:31,730
That's all.
I got guys,

1893
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:36,200
great video that I just gave you the 
highlights.

1894
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:40,600
We can just clip this and putting this 
on our main channel,

1895
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:46,220
but hopefully we're going to start over 
and why couldn't you have video,

1896
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:48,553
new subject,
new everything and hopefully I can 

1897
01:45:51,321 --> 01:45:56,321
leverage this haircut into a new joke 
because I don't want to waste a broccoli

1898
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:58,110
assassin.
Cut for now.

1899
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:04,190
I was calling this the carat cut because
the Broccoli was more about the crown.

1900
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:07,880
Carrot is more about the stem.
It's like a carrot cut.

1901
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:12,740
If I had spray Tan,
it could be a real character,

1902
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:14,920
but like a nice orange.
You.

1903
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:18,520
What could make that happen?
All right,

1904
01:46:18,521 --> 01:46:20,770
let's watch this.
Thank you too for your submission.

1905
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:21,730
Uh,
Joshua,

1906
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:23,293
your home is never a good idea of floyd 
county man found that out for himself 

1907
01:46:27,051 --> 01:46:29,910
after having a gun pointed at him when 
he did.

1908
01:46:29,911 --> 01:46:33,140
Just that way.
Empty Sean Allen talk with the victim.

1909
01:46:33,141 --> 01:46:38,141
In that case we'll say math is on the 
rise.

1910
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:39,273
Math as a result.
So it must've been a bad batch around 

1911
01:46:42,591 --> 01:46:43,424
here called forward.
Counties went crazy in the last four 

1912
01:46:45,231 --> 01:46:46,064
days.
Neighbors notify Mason Tackett that his 

1913
01:46:48,471 --> 01:46:49,590
cousin,
Phillip,

1914
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:53,250
Matthew Higgins was seen carrying items 
from his house

1915
01:46:53,330 --> 01:46:55,780
when I finally got down here and for the
house to look.

1916
01:46:55,781 --> 01:46:58,470
So you walk out the door was standing 
wide open.

1917
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,830
It looked like he was packing up for 
yard sale.

1918
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:04,420
You got my fan by the way.
They wanted hagans

1919
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:07,260
cracks me up.
What is he like one inch tall?

1920
01:47:09,010 --> 01:47:13,530
It's like a chase through grant.
It's like from his perspective,

1921
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:20,443
no,
it's not that everybody else wants 

1922
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:31,490
Tackett found items belonging to him.

1923
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:33,193
Pull a gun on me when I got back around 
the house because I guess he thought I 

1924
01:47:36,171 --> 01:47:37,370
was upset with him.

1925
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:38,343
Items not normally.
The target of the would be burglar who 

1926
01:47:41,591 --> 01:47:45,990
steals a cheese grater.
She's got the worst.

1927
01:47:47,110 --> 01:47:52,110
He stole the empty bottle of was my soap
stone massage.

1928
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:54,823
I still feel the pagans is charged with 
receiving stolen property and being a 

1929
01:47:59,951 --> 01:48:03,010
convicted felon with a firearm in Turkey
creek.

1930
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:05,770
Sean Allen,
way empty mountain.

1931
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:06,613
New Tech.
It hard to believe that it's not a 

1932
01:48:09,341 --> 01:48:12,780
sketch.
Still be stolen.

1933
01:48:12,910 --> 01:48:15,220
Who steals a cheese grater?
That guy's awesome.

1934
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:18,770
His accent is amazing.
It's amazing.

1935
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:20,780
What did you say?
Kentucky.

1936
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:23,630
Kentucky.
Go lead.

1937
01:48:23,690 --> 01:48:24,523
I feel like that deserves a golly.
I feel like that deserves a jimminy 

1938
01:48:29,641 --> 01:48:30,474
cricket

1939
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:34,140
and really you could say anything with 
that.

1940
01:48:34,141 --> 01:48:36,210
Excellent.
And it would be fun and amazing.

1941
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:41,600
I'll tell you what.
No thank you.

1942
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:42,493
Say hit me with that cricket.
You got to just using it after he hit 

1943
01:48:47,641 --> 01:48:51,140
me,
like I really don't mind that either.

1944
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:55,680
Can't use it anymore.
So I'll lead jimminy cricket.

1945
01:48:56,430 --> 01:48:59,940
Who steals a cheese grater?
He stole my Nana's.

1946
01:49:01,190 --> 01:49:02,320
I gotta find something,
you know,

1947
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:08,090
a boo just Bu.
Um,

1948
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:10,973
this was an interesting story.
Taylor swift apparently used to travel 

1949
01:49:15,871 --> 01:49:16,704
in a suitcase to avoid hopper Razzi.
Now Taylor swift is one of the most 

1950
01:49:22,261 --> 01:49:25,020
famous people in the world.
And so I can understand that,

1951
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:25,973
uh,
trying to avoid popper Razzi was 

1952
01:49:27,601 --> 01:49:28,434
probably a source of great discomfort 
and a and annoyance to her to say that 

1953
01:49:34,321 --> 01:49:36,270
lead,
but the,

1954
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:41,010
the level that she went to to avoid them
was amazing.

1955
01:49:41,370 --> 01:49:44,880
And I want to say is a testament to how 
annoying these people are.

1956
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:47,530
Rather than that,
it should reflect poorly on her.

1957
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:48,130
That being

1958
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:49,270
said,
it is incredible.

1959
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:50,800
Uh,
Zane,

1960
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:55,920
this was the one direction.
Confirm.

1961
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:57,173
Keep confronting winter.
So this guy from Zane says Taylor swift 

1962
01:50:00,281 --> 01:50:03,370
was traveling around a suitcase during 
the summer of 2007.

1963
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:07,390
Um,
and so he,

1964
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:09,250
I love the heat.
So here it is.

1965
01:50:09,251 --> 01:50:10,690
Here's the alleged suitcase

1966
01:50:12,670 --> 01:50:15,880
the other day explained to me that this 
was actually a rumor at the time and was

1967
01:50:15,881 --> 01:50:17,620
like,
dismissed as just being kind of a meme,

1968
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,540
but it's just way too over the top to be
real.

1969
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,240
But now evidently this guy saying,
no,

1970
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:24,700
you don't.
This is all really happening.

1971
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:26,013
Taylor swift.
So when they were dating or they were 

1972
01:50:28,841 --> 01:50:29,674
friends,
I know you're super famous and now he's 

1973
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:34,020
funny.
He's an outing.

1974
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:34,900
Elaborated.
Yeah.

1975
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:40,310
I mean imagine that.
Imagine that she's in that sick also.

1976
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,530
It's such like an undignified thing for 
someone like Taylor swift.

1977
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:46,410
All right.
Now curl up and getting the suitcase.

1978
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:47,490
I wonder if it's like,
well,

1979
01:50:47,491 --> 01:50:48,620
pad it.
If it's nice and cool.

1980
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:50,510
I was wondering.
That's what I like or know of it.

1981
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:54,000
Or is it even like form cut to her.
You know what I mean?

1982
01:50:54,001 --> 01:50:54,834
Like it's a little like fetal position.
Taylor swift slot that she just doesn't 

1983
01:50:58,351 --> 01:51:02,070
have that much space in there.
Taylor swift being transported in a huge

1984
01:51:02,071 --> 01:51:06,060
suitcase from our tribeca apartment in 
to her truck fleet of cars,

1985
01:51:06,061 --> 01:51:09,300
including two large cadillacs and three 
suv is arrived at Taylor's apartment,

1986
01:51:09,301 --> 01:51:12,360
Tribeca to move a large suitcase from 
her apartment.

1987
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:14,793
Also dozens of Taylor swift security 
guys were present to move this package 

1988
01:51:17,301 --> 01:51:20,450
carefully as Taylor swift remains to be 
unseen for a long time.

1989
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:25,610
Now I went and there's a bunch of other 
photos of this suitcase

1990
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:27,443
and for the audio listeners,
stay understand this suitcase is not 

1991
01:51:29,761 --> 01:51:31,470
that bad at all.
Well,

1992
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:34,260
you would have to be smaller than a 
person for sure.

1993
01:51:34,261 --> 01:51:35,530
She definitely laid

1994
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:40,820
barone all crunched up in a ball cannon 
ball into a swimming pool.

1995
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:42,370
So

1996
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:46,310
here some detectives have a little 
bigger than a regular suitcase.

1997
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:46,870
I feel like.
Well,

1998
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:48,910
it looks like a mute for use for 
musical.

1999
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:51,040
That's what it looks like.
You can see here.

2000
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:54,793
I mean if anything,
this is kind of a testament to help 

2001
01:51:56,270 --> 01:51:57,103
FDIC.
This Papa Razzi imagine you're willing 

2002
01:51:59,451 --> 01:52:02,900
to do crawl into a fricken suitcase to 
have.

2003
01:52:03,110 --> 01:52:04,820
Well,
do you know what she's doing?

2004
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,920
She probably wants to go do something 
private.

2005
01:52:06,950 --> 01:52:07,783
Maybe she wants to fly somewhere,
go to a beach without everyone knowing 

2006
01:52:09,981 --> 01:52:14,480
what she's doing all the time every day.
So if like I get it.

2007
01:52:14,570 --> 01:52:15,403
If you're trying to go hang out with all
these filters like filming you and 

2008
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:20,000
recording you,
it's like,

2009
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:22,490
you know,
you got to do what you can.

2010
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:29,730
I always see videos of Justin Bieber and
the proprietor people driving him crazy.

2011
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:31,870
Yeah,
they're pretty aggressive with Justin.

2012
01:52:31,871 --> 01:52:35,500
I've seen that shit too.
It gives them shipped back though.

2013
01:52:35,501 --> 01:52:36,334
I like watching those,
but there's a lot of videos where he's 

2014
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:39,813
nice at first and they really push it 
and then they start asking him really 

2015
01:52:43,361 --> 01:52:47,150
inappropriate getting in his way so he 
can drive away.

2016
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:48,633
Yeah.

2017
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:50,630
Yeah,
man.

2018
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:54,440
Fame on that level is really.
It's so.

2019
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,633
It's so cheap.
People need to appreciate how 

2020
01:52:57,081 --> 01:52:58,160
challenging and

2021
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:00,103
I mean those aspects for sure.
People are paid to try and piss you off 

2022
01:53:03,930 --> 01:53:05,940
literally,
like they're just there to piss you off,

2023
01:53:05,941 --> 01:53:08,160
so you flip out and then it's a story 
story,

2024
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:08,770
right?
Yeah.

2025
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:10,570
Just imagine that everywhere you go in 
public,

2026
01:53:10,571 --> 01:53:13,540
people are paid to Piss you off and 
record it.

2027
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:15,220
Yeah.
I mean,

2028
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:16,083
so I hope that people have a more of 
appreciation for what ultra famous 

2029
01:53:20,291 --> 01:53:21,124
people go through on a day to day basis 
is that it's not all just because 

2030
01:53:23,681 --> 01:53:24,514
there's.
I always hear this kind of sentiment of 

2031
01:53:25,151 --> 01:53:25,511
like,
Oh,

2032
01:53:25,511 --> 01:53:26,344
you have no right to complain once I 
tell that to somebody that crawls into 

2033
01:53:28,781 --> 01:53:30,370
side a suitcase.

2034
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:35,440
I mean obviously the riches and the fame
that,

2035
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:37,640
that's nice and I'm sure they enjoy 
that,

2036
01:53:37,641 --> 01:53:40,550
but you're right,
it comes with baggage.

2037
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:41,650
Comes with some serious bag,

2038
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:45,180
a lot,
a lot money doesn't buy you happiness,

2039
01:53:45,181 --> 01:53:46,014
I guarantee and promise you that buys 
you a one way ticket in a freaking 

2040
01:53:49,591 --> 01:53:52,770
suitcase in this case.
Um,

2041
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:56,910
I thought that was wild.
I was frankly shocked by that.

2042
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:00,900
What else?
Uh,

2043
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:03,500
what else we got?
What they forgot.

2044
01:54:03,501 --> 01:54:06,450
What else do we got?
People showing an explosion.

2045
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:10,263
Ian,
do you have anything to say about this 

2046
01:54:10,621 --> 01:54:15,300
Kanye Ego?
Like of the dance group?

2047
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:16,710
You want to come in here and watch it 
with us?

2048
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,073
He's like chickens.
I please know really does not much to 

2049
01:54:21,571 --> 01:54:23,140
watch.
I in,

2050
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:25,770
in here like Ben and he's nice.
He's sweet,

2051
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,630
he's a great guy.
He's got a good presence,

2052
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:31,020
you know,
but if you don't want to,

2053
01:54:31,021 --> 01:54:32,730
I won't force you.
I may not understand that.

2054
01:54:32,731 --> 01:54:36,600
Uh,
you have a choice.

2055
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:41,710
I'm not going to podcast rape you,
but you are fired if you don't come.

2056
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:43,613
Yeah.
Let's,

2057
01:54:44,290 --> 01:54:45,840
uh,
let me find it.

2058
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:47,810
There's a new meme now about,
uh,

2059
01:54:47,910 --> 01:54:51,570
what else?
Me saying what else there is.

2060
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:54,330
Yep.
Used to be fascinating.

2061
01:54:54,331 --> 01:54:58,710
Now it's what else?
That's funny.

2062
01:54:59,010 --> 01:55:02,310
It's been a long,
long pot.

2063
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:05,700
Okay.
Where is it?

2064
01:55:05,730 --> 01:55:10,730
I got a whole list of things here.
What else do you see it in this document

2065
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:14,240
that I'm looking at it right now.
You can do.

2066
01:55:14,241 --> 01:55:16,260
Highlight it for me.
Why don't I see it?

2067
01:55:16,261 --> 01:55:17,080
There it is.

2068
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:17,913
Okay.

2069
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:25,390
Kanye has gone on stage,
dressed as the joker.

2070
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:27,530
A,
correct me if I'm wrong.

2071
01:55:28,110 --> 01:55:30,620
Not intentionally.
It looks like the joker.

2072
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:33,440
I hate to say this and I don't want to 
offend anybody,

2073
01:55:33,441 --> 01:55:38,441
but he kind of looks like the guy that.
I hate to say this.

2074
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:39,403
So don't say you shouldn't.
The hair and the joker is reminiscent 

2075
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:46,711
of,
okay,

2076
01:55:46,711 --> 01:55:50,570
I'm not the guy that shot up the theater
on the Batman.

2077
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:54,390
It's not saying yes shooter,
just saying it looks like the guy.

2078
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:57,780
Is that awful to say?
I mean,

2079
01:55:57,781 --> 01:55:58,770
it's just the orange hair.
Right?

2080
01:55:58,780 --> 01:55:59,613
Right.
So

2081
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:02,663
yeah,

2082
01:56:10,570 --> 01:56:13,250
he looks like he's doing the elaine 
dance kind of thing.

2083
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:20,440
How people have speculated that he's on 
drugs.

2084
01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:23,060
Is that substantiate or you think he's 
just having fun?

2085
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:27,860
I think once the power of that music 
just takes over your soul.

2086
01:56:27,890 --> 01:56:31,250
You can't do much,
but just let it possess you.

2087
01:56:31,251 --> 01:56:34,340
Like that's the drug.
The beauty of his music.

2088
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:35,703
Thank you.
He very much reminds me of in though 

2089
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:44,340
then a little bit of a goober just in 
general,

2090
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:46,500
like fun.
What am I talking about?

2091
01:56:46,501 --> 01:56:48,780
Why maybe you such an asshole.
He's having a good time,

2092
01:56:48,781 --> 01:56:50,760
man.
He is letting it go.

2093
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:52,770
Dance like nobody's watching.
That's what they say.

2094
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,770
They going to judge the guy.
We're having a good ass time.

2095
01:56:55,771 --> 01:56:56,604
Why?
People got to say it looks like the 

2096
01:56:56,851 --> 01:56:59,400
shooters shot up Batman Theater.
Who's saying that?

2097
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:01,173
Ignorant.

2098
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:02,780
He's having a great time.
Yeah.

2099
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,480
I wish I could go out and dance like 
that.

2100
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:07,013
Get it.

2101
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:10,460
I heard that people were really happy 
with his performance.

2102
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:11,303
Actually

2103
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:13,260
having a good time.
Dude.

2104
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:14,810
Look at me being a.

2105
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:18,010
let's see what they think.

2106
01:57:19,890 --> 01:57:20,950
Somebody aunt,
whatever.

2107
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:24,440
I don't need to re imagine reading 
reddit comments on live on a podcast.

2108
01:57:29,030 --> 01:57:30,870
Well,
it's been two hours less.

2109
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:34,130
The wedding dress is very short,
so let's wrap it up here.

2110
01:57:37,570 --> 01:57:42,570
Texas woman declares a tech was woman's 
celebrates or divorced by blowing up her

2111
01:57:43,631 --> 01:57:45,100
wedding dress.
Well,

2112
01:57:45,101 --> 01:57:47,170
I can see that.
That was a healthy relationship,

2113
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:52,423
man.

2114
01:57:52,870 --> 01:57:53,703
What the hell did that guy do to you?
There's like a whole party here to 

2115
01:57:58,361 --> 01:57:59,194
celebrate.

2116
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:04,823
Why?

2117
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:07,570
Oh my God.

2118
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:20,590
That was a lot more than I expected.
Just be like a little mad or something.

2119
01:58:20,710 --> 01:58:23,890
That's a real explosion.
What that guy did to her man,

2120
01:58:23,891 --> 01:58:27,730
but whew,
that's a good.

2121
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:29,830
It's a good thing.
You guys got divorced.

2122
01:58:32,810 --> 01:58:33,643
Yeah.

2123
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:39,300
Alright guys.
We're thinking of doing an extra episode

2124
01:58:39,301 --> 01:58:41,100
on Tuesday now.
Me,

2125
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:42,250
a fan of the Howard

2126
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,083
stern show,
they have this segment called cleaning 

2127
01:58:45,131 --> 01:58:45,964
out the computer,
which is all the segments and all this 

2128
01:58:48,911 --> 01:58:52,420
stuff they had planned that they never 
got time to do on the show.

2129
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,273
Thinking of setting up a panel here with
Ian and Dan to join us and to go over 

2130
01:58:59,801 --> 01:59:00,634
all the great things of the year that we
never had time to get to do an extra 

2131
01:59:04,961 --> 01:59:05,794
episode on Tuesday.
Let me know what you guys think about 

2132
01:59:08,561 --> 01:59:09,790
that idea.
Not that,

2133
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:10,624
uh,

2134
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:12,473
wow.

2135
01:59:12,650 --> 01:59:17,650
Who Watches the steep anyway?
If you're watching type in the comments.

2136
01:59:18,141 --> 01:59:22,890
Um,
uh,

2137
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:25,780
what should they type in the comments 
for the frog loves a Ms.

2138
01:59:25,781 --> 01:59:27,010
Dot piggy is big titties,
right?

2139
01:59:27,060 --> 01:59:28,120
Yeah.
That's the classic.

2140
01:59:28,130 --> 01:59:29,810
That was the big one.
But I want to know.

2141
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:32,153
Um,

2142
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:35,583
did you know that I read this?
That farts used to be to actually a 

2143
01:59:41,831 --> 01:59:42,664
danger to public safety before people 
started wearing underwear because you 

2144
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:47,343
actually fart out aerosol shit.
Particles and people could breed them 

2145
01:59:51,161 --> 01:59:53,310
and get sick.
I swear it.

2146
01:59:53,311 --> 01:59:55,570
That's what I read.
That's why people wear underwear.

2147
01:59:55,571 --> 01:59:59,190
They invented it back in the day.
So how much just underwear do,

2148
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:00,910
did you read this?
I read it.

2149
02:00:00,911 --> 02:00:02,740
I don't remember,
but it seemed credible.

2150
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:08,220
But that your farts obviously our permit
or passed through the fabric.

2151
02:00:08,351 --> 02:00:13,351
So the ship particles are not allowed to
freely enter your,

2152
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:15,390
your neighbor's face.
You.

2153
02:00:15,890 --> 02:00:16,723
But look that up.
I swear a faculty commando is like a 

2154
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:20,590
public health nuisance.
Well,

2155
02:00:20,591 --> 02:00:21,424
no,
I think through the pants you're 

2156
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:24,450
probably fine,
but if you're like bare ass farting,

2157
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:26,861
I don't know.
Look it up.

2158
02:00:26,861 --> 02:00:28,130
I swore a fact.
Check me right now.

2159
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:31,400
Yellow.
He was all fucking day.

2160
02:00:31,530 --> 02:00:32,363
I think that whole,
that whole statement about being 

2161
02:00:34,750 --> 02:00:35,583
dangerous.
That's what people should type if 

2162
02:00:36,491 --> 02:00:39,850
they've stuck around this data type.
This did,

2163
02:00:39,851 --> 02:00:40,684
you know,
farts are dangerous if you're not 

2164
02:00:41,861 --> 02:00:42,694
wearing underwear

2165
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:47,760
done deal.
And then if I see that,

2166
02:00:47,850 --> 02:00:49,920
I'll know that you want an episode on 
Tuesday.

2167
02:00:49,950 --> 02:00:52,610
Well if you watch this deep,
you probably do want app.

2168
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:53,473
So on Tuesdays,
this isn't a good sample size 

2169
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:00,660
necessarily.
Let's end this guys.

2170
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:06,080
Have a blessed beautiful Friday.
Thank you all so much for watching.

2171
02:01:06,571 --> 02:01:11,571
And again,
I want to thank you guys too for all the

2172
02:01:11,911 --> 02:01:16,911
nice comments.
The episode before last was an amazing.

2173
02:01:17,190 --> 02:01:17,851
Yeah,
no,

2174
02:01:17,851 --> 02:01:22,851
I mean there's spent a lot of criticism 
which I'm happy that I've acknowledged,

2175
02:01:23,730 --> 02:01:28,440
but there's also been a lot of love and 
support and understanding which I have a

2176
02:01:28,441 --> 02:01:33,441
tendency to focus on the negative and 
this semester positive,

2177
02:01:33,811 --> 02:01:34,644
but that's so messed up.
And everybody who takes their time to 

2178
02:01:37,411 --> 02:01:39,950
show support and love it means so

2179
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:42,610
it's so important to me.
So appreciate it.

2180
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:47,570
Thank you.
I mean truly.

2181
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:54,040
So with that being said,
I didn't mean to do that one.

2182
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:55,813
I'm sorry.
You guys know the audience loves that 

2183
02:01:58,101 --> 02:02:00,360
one.
I meant to do that.

2184
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:01,810
Well,
I'm not going to touch the sound.

2185
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:04,610
Um,
thank you all.

2186
02:02:04,611 --> 02:02:06,470
Have a blessing.
Beautiful Friday.

2187
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:08,600
Wonderful.
Productive,

2188
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:10,850
happy,
wholesome weekend.

2189
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:16,670
There's a good chance we might be her on
Tuesday and Friday.

2190
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:21,110
And then the week after Bill Wirtz,
which I'm also.

2191
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:23,720
Was there any progress on getting a.
What was his name?

2192
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:28,600
What was his name?
The comedian.

2193
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:29,970
I love.
I'm blanket.

2194
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:33,560
You weren't in touch with them.
Oh,

2195
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:35,121
uh,
yeah.

2196
02:02:35,121 --> 02:02:36,350
Um.
Oh God.

2197
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:39,520
Ryan,
A.

2198
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:40,550
Brian.
Brian Regan.

2199
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:41,690
Brian Regan.
There you go.

2200
02:02:42,410 --> 02:02:45,650
I love him so much.
So he might be coming home.

2201
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,390
There's no plan.
We are also planning to do what?

2202
02:02:50,391 --> 02:02:53,360
Charity stream like last year.
Yes,

2203
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:57,950
and that might be the last episode of 
this year.

2204
02:02:58,250 --> 02:03:03,250
Right?
That's what the heck was that cheering?

2205
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:05,840
I don't we.
We've officially run out the outro song.

2206
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:06,970
It's looping.
Oh Shit.

2207
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:08,650
Let's get out of here.
Let's go.

2208
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:10,610
We got plenty of time.
We talk about that.

2209
02:03:10,611 --> 02:03:13,700
We'll have time to talk about it.
That was going to be on December.

2210
02:03:13,730 --> 02:03:14,570
Well,
hey,

2211
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:18,040
thanks for watching guys.
We love you.

2212
02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:22,820
Wish you all the Cape Creek watching.
Will some of you on Tuesday?

2213
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:24,380
I might.
