Actually we have a new call in number 
two that I think is really suiting that.

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,480

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:19,791

23
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:29,780
Thank God,
thank the gods she is.

24
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,570
It's a little too soon for her to hop in
front of the camera.

25
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,890
So she is uh,
and back right now she's here,

26
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:37,724
she's cracking whips.
She is making sure that everybody is 

27
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:42,780
crossing their t's and dotting their i's
back there.

28
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,230
They're all in mortal fear of you right 
now.

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,050
It's true.
No fucking around this time.

30
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,790
But we will be having a special episode 
next week on Tuesday.

31
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:53,624
I think what it's just gonna be me and 
Isla probably just like a 30 minute 

32
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,160
little app where we can just kind of 
talk,

33
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,420
bring her back,
get her back in,

34
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,483
see how she's doing.
And then on Thursday we've got dunky 

35
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,670
video game donkey and Leah.
It'd be great.

36
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,940
Would that being said,
we've got so much to get to,

37
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:16,840
but first let's start with our goof of 
the day.

38
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,030
I was trying to think of a name of a 
last week,

39
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,253
goof of the day.
I like the idea when we do these top of 

40
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:25,660
the weeks to start it every time with a 
beautiful,

41
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,613
great little video that we're all going 
to love goof of the day up first we've 

42
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:35,740
got laughter yoga,
this video.

43
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm very conflicted about this video 
laughter yoga because,

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,260
well yeah,
I'll just show you.

45
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:44,094
It's like these people,
they all have these awful diseases and 

46
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:52,941
their method of coping with it is by 
manic laughing.

47
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,390
I get it.
Like I think it's a cool thing,

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,760
but it's like it's so eerie and strange.
I mean,

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,750
let me,
let me,

50
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,390
let's just start it off right here guys.
Here we go.

51
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,690
God bless.
[inaudible]

52
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,550
diagnosis and we're going to laugh 
again.

53
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,340
Yeah,
and so you go around the room,

54
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:21,680
it's very powerful.
Now if you don't,

55
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,700
and we'll do it just with a few people 
here just to get a flavor.

56
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,930
If anybody has a diagnosis they want to 
share and laugh about that,

57
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:30,170
that'd be great.
And if you don't,

58
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,950
then what I've done is combine it with 
the ha ha mantra,

59
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,143
which is you'll say your name and what 
happened recently to you that normally 

60
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:43,310
would really bum you out and share it 
with us and we'll laugh at it.

61
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,320
So it's that whole psychology of,
you know,

62
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,773
turning lemons.

63
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,700
Oops.

64
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,530
Was it into lemonade?
Okay,

65
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,720
so you guys get it.
This lady,

66
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,430
by the way,
where do you get that Eric?

67
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,023
I think on face value it sounds nice,
but when you watch it it's like I just 

68
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:02,524
don't buy the laughter.
It's like the saddest shit I've ever 

69
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:05,464
seen.

70
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,780
Yeah.

71
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,890
So here's,
I'll,

72
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:09,780
and I always start and say,
here's how it looks.

73
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:12,150
So my name is Geeta.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,833
The one thing that throws me off,
it makes me feel strange about this is 

75
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:19,564
like why laughing after the name?
It makes it seem like they're just 

76
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:24,041
clowning.
Yeah.

77
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,620
That was about trauma.
Like they laugh,

78
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,940
they laugh after they say the trauma,
but then like they're like,

79
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:32,020
hi,
my name's Ethan.

80
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,100
It's like,
it feels like you're getting clowned on,

81
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,630
you're going to see what I mean.

82
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,813
Okay.

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,553
I Dunno.

84
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,910
[inaudible]

85
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,330
your name for Christ's sake.
You know what I mean?

86
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,170
It's like,
all right,

87
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,480
something's not right.

88
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,410
And I was diagnosed with Parkinson's.

89
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,050
[inaudible].

90
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,290
Anybody else want to share

91
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,980
the idea?
It's a strange,

92
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:19,480
it's a strange thing,
you know?

93
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,210
Very strange.
I get it.

94
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,350
You know,
I get it.

95
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,870
It's a nice wholesome thing and they're 
trying to do here.

96
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,183
I just,

97
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,530
I dunno.
It's so eerie.

98
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,450
That's something so off about it.
You'll see it get,

99
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:37,451
it gets more obscene as they go along,
but I don't get the whole very good.

100
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:40,850
Very good.
Yay.

101
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,480
Like all of a sudden they're in 
kindergarten and it goes where they lost

102
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:45,930
me to be honest.
Yeah,

103
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,843
you're kind of understand it.
But then when the weird like cult 

104
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:51,110
chanting started it,
it got pretty creepy,

105
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,893
right?

106
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,270
Error.
Yes.

107
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,680
My name is dawn

108
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,530
don.
He took a shot.

109
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,930
He took a shot.
You know,

110
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:05,240
he put his hand up in class.
My name is Don.

111
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,430
Why you got to goof while you got a 
clown on poor don?

112
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,850
That's so weird.
Or they laugh at their name.

113
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,740
I recently acquired insulin dependent 
diabetes.

114
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:22,943
Yeah.

115
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,120
Sorry.
Not to see it like them just laughing at

116
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,740
their misfortune.
They're not,

117
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,591
it just,
I don't,

118
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't see them like embrace from my 
perspective,

119
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,260
I just acquired insulin resistant 
diabetes.

120
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,563
I Dunno.
I just sounds like they're clowning on 

121
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:46,650
hysterical.
That's the funniest Shit

122
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,563
I've heard all day.

123
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,570
Yay.

124
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,760
Yes.
Hi,

125
00:06:57,761 --> 00:07:02,761
my name is Vicky.
Yes sir.

126
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,040
Okay.

127
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,920
The one that got me,
I've got breast cancer.

128
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:12,920
Okay.

129
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,680
That's the funniest shit I've heard all 
year.

130
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,573
This,
this woman's eyes really lit up on that 

131
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:19,100
one.
She's like,

132
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,090
she's like,
oh fuck.

133
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:25,090
A more tragic to the more hilarious.
My name's Vicky and um,

134
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,060
I was,
I was stranded and had to eat my own son

135
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,110
to stay alive.

136
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,423
Okay.

137
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,530
It's like the more tragic,
the more hilarious,

138
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,683
hey,

139
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,980
yes.
I don't buy it.

140
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,770
I think I just don't buy it.
Like she's got the happy face earrings.

141
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,150
She's got the laughter Yoga.
She's all smiles.

142
00:07:57,151 --> 00:07:57,984
But

143
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:58,830
okay.

144
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,100
There's like a real sadness,
you know what I mean?

145
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:04,080
It's like they're not acknowledged.
I Dunno.

146
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,540
What do I know?
Healthy?

147
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,140
No.
Yeah,

148
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,760
that's what I don't know.
I don't know.

149
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:13,050
Something about this seems so demented 
and I don't want to goof on these people

150
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:13,411
because,
you know,

151
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,240
they're trying to cope with some 
difficult stuff.

152
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,390
Just trying to an allen analyze how I 
feel about it.

153
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,600
Let's see.
Maybe the next one is just like straight

154
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:24,434
up like,

155
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,153
you know,

156
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,650
my husband,
I'm Dan and I murdered my son.

157
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,320
Right.
And I ate his corpse.

158
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,980
Very good.
Very good.

159
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:34,814
Yay.

160
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,553
Becca.

161
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,083
Okay.

162
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,100
Diagnosed with 19 years ago.

163
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,033
Okay.

164
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,423
Okay.

165
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,890
Oh name and

166
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,840
let her like,
they cut the,

167
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:57,150
kind of cut her off.
They did like an academy award on her.

168
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,230
That's,
she's like,

169
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:00,960
I was developed with Ms 19 years ago.
It's like,

170
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:01,680
all right,
bitch,

171
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,000
tone it down.
It's old news.

172
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,490
It's 19 years ago and who gives a shit?
It was also like,

173
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,280
I didn't give you permission to expand.
You have Ms.

174
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,680
Move on to the next person.
We're all fucking dying here.

175
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,860
Yeah.
My name is,

176
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,493
uh,

177
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,490
hi guys.
My name is Ethan and um,

178
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,673
my anal sphincter muscle has stopped 
operating and I'm perpetually shitting 

179
00:09:33,191 --> 00:09:34,024
my pants.

180
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,130
That's really nice.

181
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,720
That tragic compared to what they're 
dealing with.

182
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,163
What's,
you know.

183
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,060
Okay.

184
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,893
Let's see.

185
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,220
Yeah.

186
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,360
Uh,
yes.

187
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:52,361
My name is Christine.
That's what people think.

188
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:53,204
I'm overweight.

189
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,360
Oh,
whoa,

190
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,350
whoa,
whoa.

191
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,300
What was that?
Let me go back.

192
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,280
Got Up.
Does that got a huge laugh?

193
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,360
It wasn't just that she's okay.

194
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,223
Yay.

195
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,390
Yes.
My name is Christine.

196
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,870
Some people think I'm overweight.

197
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,330
Do you need to leave?
That doesn't qualify for Yoga.

198
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,590
Laughter.
By the way,

199
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:17,640
she wasn't like,
Oh,

200
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,680
I'm overweight.
I'm morbidly overweight.

201
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,620
She's like,
some people think the way people get the

202
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,454
fuck

203
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,130
bill and you got crickets.

204
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,000
We got breast cancer,
we got ms overweight.

205
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,400
Shut the fuck up.

206
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,280
Great.

207
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,330
I'm a little overweight.

208
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,813
Damn.

209
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,390
Wouldn't be great if she was just like,
you know what?

210
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,770
Stop everyone.
Stop laughing,

211
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,690
bitch.
Get Out.

212
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,010
[inaudible]

213
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,670
actually laughing now.
She's like,

214
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:02,710
this isn't laugh yoga.
I'm laughing at you.

215
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,563
Oh,

216
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,810
why would you need a group?
Council did cause your,

217
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,640
some people think you're overweight.

218
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,900
That's great.
I have arthritis and diabetes.

219
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,200
Arthritis and diabetes.
Give it up.

220
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,880
Yes.
My name's Jim.

221
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,180
Sometimes I get really scared about 
running out of money.

222
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,180
You,

223
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,040
you,
you were.

224
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,933
You're in a different room.
Sometimes you get scared of running out 

225
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:50,564
of money.
You and the fat lady need to go start 

226
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,660
your own laughter yoga.
Okay.

227
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,090
What,
what?

228
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,050
They don't need to worry,
but you and everybody,

229
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:01,884
dude.
Huh?

230
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,090
All right.
I'm a chuckle at best.

231
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,490
Eh,
you don't deserve the laugh.

232
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,163
If I'm being frank chuckle yoga anyway,
I'm not sure how to make of all this 

233
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:11,190
stuff.
It's like,

234
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,193
I know they're,
they're desperately trying to cope with 

235
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:16,470
really awful,
unimaginable things,

236
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:18,570
but it's like,
it's just so eerie.

237
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:23,571
It's strange to see these things side by
side and I'm dying of breast cancer.

238
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,790
Ah,
yeah.

239
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,643
Anyway,
I have one other goof of the day that I 

240
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:34,370
wanted to watch with you guys.
Uh,

241
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,270
the Pedo Lizard,
the day,

242
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,510
the,
it's goofs of the day today,

243
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:39,350
my friend.
Wow.

244
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,950
This,
the story is that this video was used to

245
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:47,951
be shown to middleschoolers back in the 
90s to help inform them about,

246
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,960
I guess this is one like the pedophile 
scare started when every random mail,

247
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,410
specifically males was looking to abduct
you.

248
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,603
So this,
this little short here was meant to 

249
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:04,520
educate the fine innocent young children
of America.

250
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,073
And to avoiding being taken.
So here I give you the pedo hunting 

251
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,000
dinosaur.
Yeah.

252
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,330
Hi Yellow Dano here,

253
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,263
Bro.
I'm going to tell you straight up if 

254
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:19,600
there's any pedophile,
it's in that fucking suit.

255
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,150
Listen to that voice,
man.

256
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,763
I don't tell you what else.
There's enough space in that suit for a 

257
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:30,931
man and a child like he could.
He could be like clemen my suit.

258
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,133
Young one.

259
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,120
Hi there.
Whoa.

260
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,983
Damn.
You're about to see a show for parents 

261
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:39,554
and children about tricking people.
Now if you're wondering who tricky 

262
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:43,860
people

263
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,260
people,
that's a nice way to say child rapist.

264
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,400
Ah,
well just put it bluntly.

265
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,160
They're people who want to harm 
children.

266
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,230
Drink it,
drink it,

267
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,370
drink it,
drink it.

268
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,470
People everywhere you look it could,

269
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,990
well you're trying to fuck.
And also what's wrong with you?

270
00:13:58,991 --> 00:13:59,824
Like why?
Like this dinosaur character is just so 

271
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:02,921
strange.
He's like,

272
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:06,190
I look in everywhere.
If there's rapists everywhere,

273
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,630
it's like at a certain point,
if you see them that frequently,

274
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,740
you're looking too hard.
Maybe you're looking,

275
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,130
you need to look inward like this.
Dinosaurs,

276
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,070
there's a real true pat o'hare.
I mean really,

277
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,593
and it kind of,

278
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,230
my name is reginald charming.
I put the show on here today.

279
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,910
Cool.
Did I just miss your mom

280
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,973
by the way?
This is like the main villain was this 

281
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,700
name Reginald charming.
Yeah,

282
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:35,534
his last name charming.
It's like these guys are fucking the 

283
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:39,950
guys who made this our,
I swear to God,

284
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:42,320
you'll have to touch kids to dream the 
shit up.

285
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,453
Like you have to have at least have a 
couple of children and your slavery 

286
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:47,774
dungeon.
The dream of this yellow jazz talking 

287
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:56,270
Dinosaur Anti Child Rape Superhero and 
the name of villain.

288
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,540
Mr Charming.
I'm mister charming.

289
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,490
Okay,
so you use it on the little kids today.

290
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,870
Something subtle like asking them,
oh no,

291
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:11,141
no,
no,

292
00:15:11,141 --> 00:15:11,730
no,
no.

293
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,650
Wait,
I've got some bumpy.

294
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,070
Why the fuck did they sound like Chris 
Rock?

295
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,390
Oh No,
not the old puppies in the car.

296
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,140
He's fucking regional though to,
he's like citizen justice.

297
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,663
I don't know what they're advocating,
but this guy hasn't raped any kids and 

298
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:33,290
you're loving you're,
you're strong.

299
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,710
Arming him against a wall man.
Also,

300
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,650
it's like such a Chris rock 
impersonation.

301
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,573
It's tripping me out as a great shit.
Imagine being in middle school and 

302
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:48,281
trying to extrapolate meaning from this.
This is just so insane.

303
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,660
Is he explicitly a dinosaur?
I don't know what else he could be.

304
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,130
Yeah,
it's fucking weird.

305
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,950
Maybe he's you.
Did you see sin city where they chop off

306
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,470
the pedals balls and he turns yellow?
Maybe that's what this is.

307
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,573
Oh Shit.
This is like the devolution and he's a 

308
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,780
yellow man.
Yeah,

309
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,750
he's a castrated pedophile.
Oh,

310
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,980
I'm an upstanding citizen

311
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,440
dude.
This shit so fucked up.

312
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,013
He tricks all these little girls and 
into doing a photo shoot for him and 

313
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:27,580
he's in there taking photos and look at 
it as creepy.

314
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:30,820
A little friend like cheering them on 
and then at the end,

315
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,330
which I'll show you the dinosaur breaks 
into his office to get the photos.

316
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,593
It's amazing.
It was all a sting operation and the 

317
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:42,940
rest of the dinosaur you'll see there.
There's a twist in between the lines,

318
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:44,320
which I'd like you guys to watch your 
budget.

319
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,110
There's a lot to unpack here and I'm 
really not sure.

320
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:49,590
What's the meaning?
I think the meaning is the lizards,

321
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,090
the Pedo,
every once the pedo trust.

322
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:53,710
Nobody at all.
Wow.

323
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,160
This whole pedo hysteria.
It's so strange.

324
00:16:57,161 --> 00:17:02,020
Like I don't know that there was this 
crazy pedo hysteria when I was this age.

325
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,840
But these days it's like,
don't,

326
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,793
don't,
uh,

327
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,143
don't play outside by yourself or 
there's a hundred percent chance that 

328
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:10,684
someone's going to rape you immediately.
It's like how many immediately you're 

329
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,460
innovating a rapist pedals are out there
lurking.

330
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,323
I don't know.
It's never got show one of these when 

331
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:19,360
you were growing up though.
No,

332
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,650
cause I,
not this one,

333
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:25,360
but I explicitly remember the pedo video
when I was like in elementary school,

334
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:25,840
by the way.

335
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,790
We have the Dan Cam up.
We do.

336
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,110
Oh Great.
How's it look?

337
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,910
Well,
I'm not on it right now.

338
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,100
Oh,
have you guys seen the Dan camp?

339
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,050
We haven't used it yet.
It's hit the Dan Cam.

340
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:36,560
You're talking,
it's,

341
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,843
it's hard to explain,
but if I'm just sitting here like an 

342
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:41,790
idiot like this and you're talking hit 
the damn camp,

343
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,020
but then nobody's in the Dan Kim right 
now.

344
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,130
Oh,
you're not going to Dan Cam.

345
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,690
Yeah,
we've got Ian screening calls.

346
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,710
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

347
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,800
Oh my God.
I know.

348
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,071
All right,
let me just play it.

349
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:51,840
I'm going to cut to Dan Cameron.
It's just an empty room.

350
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,970
Alright.
Um,

351
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,343
I never,
I was never shown any that's on the Dan 

352
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,520
Cameron.
All right.

353
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,353
Dan Camp.
I was never shown any anything like 

354
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,314
this.
You know,

355
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,290
all you get is like a don't get in a car
with strangers.

356
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,910
I mean,
what more do you need to know?

357
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,720
Don't take,
if some can't guys offering you candy,

358
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,063
you know,
don't let them put a finger in your ass 

359
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,463
unless it's like a full tootsie roll.
Definitely not for like a little to 

360
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,880
zero.
That's not worth the finger in the ass.

361
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,043
No bite size bullshit.
Full on like king size to cheer all you 

362
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:26,190
could basically put fit four fingers up 
my ass even today,

363
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:27,820
frankly speaking.
Good to know.

364
00:18:27,821 --> 00:18:28,880
It was a great,
all right,

365
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,420
well you got a tootsie roll.

366
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,780
Okay,

367
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,900
I will later tonight you have a dinosaur
costume.

368
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,813
You want to role play?

369
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,460
Yeah.
Oh my gosh.

370
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:39,680
Your hands off her.

371
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,910
Oh by the way,
his voice changes from,

372
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,133
he goes from,

373
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,420
okay,

374
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,770
it goes from,
uh,

375
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,230
what's his name?
Chris.

376
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,423
Chris Rock.
And he goes from Chris Rock that Bruce 

377
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,613
Willis.
Real quick,

378
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,620
man,
get your hands off.

379
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,710
Washes.
Take Lyrica is really,

380
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
how did he change your race?
His voice changed race.

381
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,620
I thought that was why

382
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,790
I didn't do anything good out of my 
office.

383
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,390
I want Carmen's pictures.
That's Ed.

384
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,190
Looks like a nipple on my right.
Fucking got him that record on the wall.

385
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,110
So fucking nipple got them.

386
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,080
What are you talking about?
Pictures.

387
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,470
Oh my God.
I don't know what Carmen told you,

388
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:36,120
but there are no pictures.
Give me the combination.

389
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:38,310
Charming.
Figure it out.

390
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,240
You big stupid lizard.
You think you're so smart?

391
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,610
Well,
you can't watch them all the time.

392
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,410
Nobody can.

393
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,403
Cool.

394
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,813
Goodness takes off with the scare me.
You're just jealous because of the kids 

395
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:06,890
liked me better than,
than like you.

396
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,240
Right?
Maybe there's something to that.

397
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,350
You hear me right?

398
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,740
So the question is

399
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,053
target

400
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,360
the photos,
those that is not,

401
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,853
that is not admissible evidence.
So the question I have is where's he 

402
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:33,760
going with those photos?
You know what I'm saying?

403
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:36,390
You can't use those in court.
You just barged in and stolen out of his

404
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:37,224
safe.
So what exactly is he doing with those 

405
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:41,340
photos?
Yeah.

406
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,200
I mean he didn't show up at the cops.
He's just kind of this vigilante.

407
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,034
You kicked in the doors,
stole the child porn and he's going 

408
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,030
home.
He's going straight home with that.

409
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:49,900
Yeah.
What the fuck?

410
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,020
Just like Yo,
share the fucking wealth man.

411
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,280
I loved how dramatic that got that.
Like Take Kiki and get outta here.

412
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,350
Like looking over your shoulder.
Yeah,

413
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,023
man,
he's going to go beat off to those 

414
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:09,790
photos.
I've never been sure of anything more in

415
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:10,624
my life.

416
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,690
So that's a weird one that,
that really,

417
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,250
I don't know.
That threw me for a loop.

418
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:18,600
That video.
That was wild dude.

419
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,140
They used to put kids in a,
you know,

420
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:27,120
auditorium,
the whole class 500 people or whatever.

421
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:27,930
I don't,
yeah,

422
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,130
and watch this.
I mean,

423
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,023
what I wish I had been shown that one,
the one I was shown was super awkward 

424
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,490
and just serious.
You know what I mean?

425
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,383
Right.
I did not have probably a better 

426
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:39,640
approach because I'm not sure I could 
extrapolate any means.

427
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,950
Avoid yellow dinosaurs.
Anyway,

428
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:46,380
that's the goof of the day.
I hope you guys had fun with that.

429
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,920
Give it up.
Wasn't that a good time everybody?

430
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,220
Well we are.
We have,

431
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,500
we have fun out here.
They should.

432
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,180
Guest experience.
Don't wait.

433
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,300
We have a lot of fun here.
Um,

434
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,670
let's get onto the main stories.
Logan.

435
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:00,720
Paul.
Wow.

436
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,520
Who's ever talked about him.
Am I right?

437
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:07,080
Is that while there was this one tweet,
I honestly couldn't let it go.

438
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,740
I had to show it to you guys because it 
really was so insane.

439
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,330
Um,
that

440
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,470
even,
even now I read it and I was just like,

441
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,360
whoa.
Right.

442
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,093
He erased it after shortly after 
tweeting it because everyone was just 

443
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:25,950
like,
wow,

444
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,783
this is insane.
So this is only from a couple of days 

445
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,300
ago.
He says,

446
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,063
and I quote board the plane,
flight attendant gives me the old 

447
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:38,460
eyeball,
up and down high socks,

448
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,220
short shorts,
saggy blonde hair.

449
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:46,410
She shaggy,
saggy tits picture.

450
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,750
Perfect.
Fuck boy.

451
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,210
Give him my ticket first class stunned.
He goes,

452
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,470
oh wow.
And points me to my seat.

453
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,520
Don't judge a book by its cover.
Wow.

454
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,510
God,
what a hero.

455
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,700
There's,
there's a lot to actually unpack here.

456
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:09,900
I feel like,
well,

457
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:12,060
first of all,
this never happened.

458
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,270
Let's just establish this right off the 
bat.

459
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,970
Bullshit.
The only thing it's missing is everybody

460
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:19,770
in the airplane standing up and 
applauding.

461
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,030
Big applause.
Yeah.

462
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,570
Albert Einstein gave him that and the 
only thing that's missing is that flight

463
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:29,160
attendant,
Albert Einstein.

464
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,000
This never fucking happened,
dude.

465
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:34,834
At this point,
you're like 24 there's no excuse for 

466
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,114
running this shit.
This is like what a 12 year old 

467
00:23:38,471 --> 00:23:41,260
fantasizes about.
Then second of all,

468
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,380
he acknowledges that he dresses like a 
fucking clown.

469
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,190
High socks,
shorts,

470
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,120
shorts,
shaggy,

471
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:50,870
blonde hair picture.
Perfect fuckboy picture.

472
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,783
If you're a fuck,
if you're going to sit there and 

473
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:55,850
acknowledge that you look like an idiot 
and that you're a fuckboy,

474
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,180
let's just change your outfit.
He's basically,

475
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:00,014
you know what he's saying is I'm wearing
all maverick shit to sell it to these 

476
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:04,094
kids,
but I would never want to wear this 

477
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:06,164
because I look like a fuck boy.
But I do like there's something in 

478
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:13,870
there,
you know there's a weird motor come have

479
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,370
a self awareness buried in there for 
sure.

480
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,553
Like who is this flight attendant?
This never seen a rich person who's 

481
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,210
apparently works first class,
their flight attendant.

482
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,840
Oh Wow.
Oh my God,

483
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,600
you're first class.
Just imagine this person.

484
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,420
I'm so sorry.
Oh my God.

485
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:41,350
Oh Wow.
I am so sorry I judged you.

486
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,220
Okay.

487
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,220
And then of course the subtle bragging 
about being rich and flying first class.

488
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,130
But what exactly are you asking?
Not to judge.

489
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,390
There's no nothing about your character.
He's saying don't,

490
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,150
don't make a judgment if someone's a 
rich or poor.

491
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,600
Okay.

492
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,630
Be careful who you're rude too because 
they might be rich.

493
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,530
The fuck.
What's the moral of the story,

494
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:13,364
Logan?
He's trying to bring awareness to the 

495
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,543
rampant persecution of fuck boys in this
country that honestly is probably the 

496
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:21,960
biggest social issue that we have to 
deal with it.

497
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,320
And not denying that he's a fuck boy.
He's like,

498
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,950
I'm a rich fuckboy and therefore you 
judged a book by its cover.

499
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,080
It's like,
dude,

500
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,430
basically he's saying because he's 
wealthy,

501
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,070
he's superior.
I mean,

502
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,420
that's really what's sewn in here.

503
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,350
Okay.

504
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,320
And to that I say,
and you are fucking,

505
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:43,871
uh,
really,

506
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:44,704
uh,
this is really one of the worst tweets 

507
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:48,390
I've ever read.
And he always says,

508
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:51,390
I'm a kid and he always has a 30 year 
old man and all that shit.

509
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:53,130
He would call me at 33 year old man.

510
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,510
You're,
that excuse is not,

511
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,403
I mean,
this is really probably the dumbest 

512
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:03,491
thing I've ever read by a public 
personality.

513
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,460
How long did he keep this up before he 
was 30,000

514
00:26:07,461 --> 00:26:08,450
likes?
So I mean,

515
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:13,510
probably half a day or more.
Was he getting a bunch of shit for it?

516
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,321
Like what?
Yeah,

517
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:16,154
I'm sure.
How did he become self aware suddenly 

518
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:19,860
that that is fucking awful.
Yeah.

519
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,980
He was probably getting shit for it and 
he was,

520
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,530
he's probably trying to play it like 
close to the hip these days,

521
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:25,364
you know?
Um,

522
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,323
he's like,
Ooh,

523
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,750
I guess he's like,
I don't understand why people don't like

524
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:30,584
this,
but I'm going to remove it because 

525
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,240
trying to keep it,
you know,

526
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,350
coach.
But I have to say I,

527
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,330
when I read this,
I said stunned.

528
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,100
I said,
oh wow.

529
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,780
And then you stood up and started 
applauding.

530
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:46,614
Right.
And then I did judge this book by its 

531
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:48,720
cover.

532
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,351
I was like,
well no,

533
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:50,490
they were right about you,
dude.

534
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,030
They weren't talking about the price.
The fact that you are first class,

535
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:55,710
they were talking about that you're such
a douchebag.

536
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,900
They saw this,
they saw him,

537
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,910
they knew it was Logan Paul.
And they're like,

538
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,610
Oh wow,
this guy's a fucking idiot.

539
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,260
And then Logan's like,
excuse me,

540
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:06,930
I'm first class.
And they're like,

541
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:08,100
yeah,
you're still,

542
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,660
you're,
that's exactly what I expected.

543
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,720
You're a fucking idiot.
This is a Marv.

544
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:15,570
I must want to frame this.
You know what I mean?

545
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:17,670
We should wait.
What is a picture?

546
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:18,960
Perfect fuck boy.
By the way.

547
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,770
Oh,
when you,

548
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,260
when you had done that self image.
We don't make someone aware,

549
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:24,450
but it's only got a negative 
connotation.

550
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,160
You don't know what a picture.
Perfect.

551
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,570
Fuck boys.
It's high socks,

552
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,680
shorts,
shorts,

553
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,480
shaggy blonde hair.
Right,

554
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:33,000
right.
Basically describing and laying it out.

555
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,770
Right.
He's a pimp or picture.

556
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:35,461
Perfect.
Fuck.

557
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:38,430
But I love it.
I want to frame,

558
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:41,550
this is the dumbest thing I've ever 
read.

559
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:42,630
I mean,
genuinely,

560
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,943
I've always,
I've reserved judgment for him and I'm 

561
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:46,200
like,
he's smart.

562
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,000
Like he's old.
He's young,

563
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,710
he's reckless,
he's crazy.

564
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,210
But he's,
he's smart.

565
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,210
No,
no.

566
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,520
The verdict's out.
This book has been read.

567
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,040
The covers flipped this books read.
We're not judging it by the cover.

568
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,630
Logan.
We've read the fucking book.

569
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,630
It's a bad book.
It's a shitty buck dead.

570
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:07,883
It's,
it's frankly this book and I think 

571
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:09,864
you'll agree it's in the bargain bin.
You can buy this book for like $2 on 

572
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:14,760
sale right now.
Kmart.

573
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,950
Yeah.
It couldn't even get it into a walmart.

574
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:18,480
It's just kmart.
This is in the bar.

575
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,373
This,
this book is frankly on sale at a 

576
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,850
salvation army right now for 50 cents.

577
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,630
Yeah.
We've read the book.

578
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,301
Well,
anyway,

579
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:31,970
I want to talk about the press 
conference he had with Ksi.

580
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,983
And again,
I don't want to talk about everything 

581
00:28:34,101 --> 00:28:34,934
pillow and Paul does,
but this stuff is so good and I got to 

582
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:38,900
say,
well,

583
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:41,330
let's take a break.
We'll talk about it when we get back.

584
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,850
We've got the press conference to talk 
about.

585
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,043
We've got BBC had an interview scheduled
for him today to promote his fight with 

586
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:52,310
KSI that they canceled.
They said it wasn't a good interview.

587
00:28:52,311 --> 00:28:53,390
That canceled.
I love that,

588
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,830
that and so,
so,

589
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:58,310
so much more.
And of course know your meme.

590
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,920
Don't go anywhere guys.
We will be right back.

591
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,650
Thank you to ring for sponsoring this 
episode of the podcast.

592
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,513
Let me tell you about ring this product.
It's one of these genius products that 

593
00:29:10,911 --> 00:29:14,990
is so perfect time and place.
It changed my life.

594
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,080
Let me show you this.
It's this little doorbell that goes over

595
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:20,570
your existing doorbell or if you don't 
even have a doorbell,

596
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:23,390
you can put it and it's got a battery 
that lasts a long time.

597
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,150
It's got a microphone so you can talk to
WHO's out there.

598
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,910
It's got a camera with a motion 
detector.

599
00:29:28,911 --> 00:29:29,744
So if someone's creeping in front of 
your door or it's just the mailman or 

600
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:34,550
pizzas here,
they ring,

601
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,190
they walk,
it opens a feed on your phone.

602
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,670
You can also check it any time,
regardless of motion and talk to them.

603
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,550
Leave the package,
knock on the door,

604
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:45,730
whatever.
This thing is changing the fricking game

605
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:47,500
here you see in the bottom right.
That's what it looks like.

606
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:49,060
You can talk,
you can see them.

607
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,403
It's so fricking powerful and amazing.
You know these guys were on shark tank 

608
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,583
and you know what?
Mark Cuban and everybody there said to 

609
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:00,850
him for those reasons amount.
You know what?

610
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,260
I'm out shark tank because ring went on.
I think it's the most successful company

611
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:09,730
that they all passed on their,
it's like $1 billion company now and you

612
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:10,564
know what?

613
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:12,970
And I say to them,

614
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:15,720
no,

615
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,700
maybe I'm relying on the switchboard a 
little too much,

616
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,430
but I'll tell you what,
I am relying on ring.

617
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,340
Okay?
They're making neighborhoods safer.

618
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,730
They are helping connect your home 
anywhere in the world.

619
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,683
If you're on vacation,
you still see what's going on at your 

620
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:32,790
front door.
You get the motion,

621
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,163
you get it all because it's on the 
Internet telling you this thing's 

622
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,193
incredible.
It's got hd video and two way audio 

623
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:44,340
features changing the game.
I got to tell you,

624
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:47,100
I have creepy people that should come to
our house.

625
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,090
That happens.
I can and it saves it to the cloud.

626
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:53,160
So if some cribs coming to my front door
that I don't want there,

627
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:55,890
it saves to the cloud.
I got you sucker.

628
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,950
I know if I want to talk to her that 
it's my mom.

629
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,960
I'm not.
No,

630
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,300
I'm kidding.
But you could use it that way.

631
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,390
Was that through rude?
As a listener,

632
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:08,224
you have a special offer on a ring 
starter kit available right now with a

634
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,663
The starter kit has everything you need

Oh,

638
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:32,410
whoa.
Didn't see you there.

639
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,710
I was just changing my life with this 
quip electric toothbrush.

640
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:36,544
You hear that?
That's the pulsating and vibrating 

641
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,633
goodness that is smack dab a loaded 
inside this incredible toothbrush that 

642
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,470
Oprah has.
Literally put a hunter Oh list.

643
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,103
Let me tell you about this thing.
If you're listening to the show and you 

644
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:56,590
have not yet got a quip,
then I'm not telling you enough.

645
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,390
It's the,
I'm obsessed with oral hygiene.

646
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,253
Okay?
Giant bulky electric toothbrushes are 

647
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:07,570
out of the question.
Those things cost $20 and it's about the

648
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:10,900
size of a car battery not bringing that 
thing with me anywhere.

649
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,550
This gives you the same pulsing action 
and this little vibrating too.

650
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,953
On top of that,
it tells you when to switch sides 

651
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:22,840
because let's be honest,
you're not brushing enough.

652
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:23,883
We all know we're a bunch of sloppy,
nasty mouth Fox that don't brush our 

653
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,654
teeth and,
and that's why your breath stinks and 

654
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,270
nobody wants to fucking kiss you or be 
within a foot of you.

655
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,860
This is going to change everything for 
you,

656
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,240
tells you when to switch sides.
It tells you when you're done brushing,

657
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:42,074
I think it's like three minutes and you 
know you're getting a perfect brush 

658
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,410
every fricking time.

What more do you need to know other than

669
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,040
that,
and let me tell you,

670
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,780
I frickin love this toothbrush.
Try it right flipping.

671
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,663
Now

672
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,033
you've all heard me talking about me on 
these and if you haven't made them move 

673
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:43,000
to get these RMDS,
you're slacking underwear.

674
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:46,750
More like funder where and yes,
you can quote me on that.

675
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,630
Me undies Sushi.
Oh,

676
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,560
cereal and milk.
Forget about it.

677
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,280
All right,
but the look is kind of the least of it.

678
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,293
It's about the comfort.
It's about material that is softer than 

679
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:03,850
cotton,
more breathable,

680
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,170
and can cradle your junk like nothing on
the market.

681
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,090
Now you guys have seen me,
dude,

682
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,180
the atomic wedgie test.
Okay?

683
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:18,650
Now I defy you to find any other brand 
that you can comfortably pull above your

684
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:20,284
tits.

685
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,610
That's the me undies guarantee or your 
money back.

686
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,900
No,
that's my guarantee.

687
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,410
Listen,
it's so soft.

688
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,860
It's so breathable.
Extreme my mouth from my balls.

689
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,840
It's insane.
Okay.

690
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,250
It sustainably sourced.
It's made from beechwood.

691
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:43,590
Do the math on that.
I don't know how it's possible to turn a

692
00:34:43,591 --> 00:34:44,424
tree and to this,
but they're got scientists on the job 

693
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:48,540
right now.
Trust me.

694
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:51,300
When you put on a pair,
you're going to get it all right.

695
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,820
Now they've got,
uh,

696
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,570
another thing.
Check this out.

697
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,470
I'm just fully nude at this point.

underwear.

699

Imagine how it feels your whole body.
You could see my junk.

700
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,000

It feels great.

701
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,760
That's the me undies pledge.
Okay.

702
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,960
Forget about it.

Alrighty,

Thanks for sticking around.
So he's on firstclass.

727
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,690
He's going somewhere clearly.
Where's he going?

728
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,290
I think I know where he's going.
Follow the lead.

729
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,170
I've got it all tracked out.
The press conference with CSI,

730
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,300
CSI.
Jesus.

731
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,900
Ksi sound like an old man.
Um,

732
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,160
who's this CSI guy?
Yeah,

733
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:53,250
exactly.
So Ksi Logan.

734
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:54,084
Paul,
you guys all know about this boxing 

735
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:55,670
match.
I'm not going to lie.

736
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,350
I'm going to watch the highlights.
I'm not going to sit here in front.

737
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:01,890
Like what?
Like I'm not even interested on aunt.

738
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,440
I'm going to watch the highlights.
I'm watching it.

739
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,210
I actually,
I think this side is going to,

740
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,703
I think Ksi will win,
but I am standing by that I think is 

741
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:14,010
going to be a shitty,
boring match ever since I heard.

742
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:14,963
So they're doing two,
one in the UK and one back here in La 

743
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,210
and they always arrange for it to do 
too.

744
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,980
I feel like it's,
it's all bogus.

745
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:25,290
Like one is going to win one and the 
other is going to win the other.

746
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,910
Ah,
I don't think,

747
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,773
I don't what you're,
you're saying that someone's going to 

748
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:29,670
throw it?
Yeah,

749
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,650
I'm not going full conspiracy,
man.

750
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,513
I don't think it's legit.
I don't think either of them have 

751
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,010
neither have,
they both have such huge egos.

752
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:42,540
I don't think either of them have it and
them to get their ass beat and throw.

753
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,150
I don't see it.
Hmm.

754
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,920
But if there's like a slaughter and the 
first one,

755
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,083
I mean,
I have no reason to believe it's weird 

756
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:52,131
to have.
Well anyway,

757
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:52,964
whatever.
Let's watch his fucking video could sit 

758
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,053
here and analyze this all.
It's just a bunch of fucking youtube or 

759
00:37:57,621 --> 00:37:58,850
xbox it like,
it's retard.

760
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,480
Like the concept is just so stupid.
They're gonna make so much money.

761
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,323
Dude,

762
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,590
hold onto the stage.

763
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,410
Anyway,
watching this video,

764
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,460
I actually start to feel bad for Logan 
Paul in a way.

765
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,890
He's just,
he gets,

766
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,580
he's the heel.
He just can't go wrestling hill.

767
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,520
So embarrassing.

768
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Like he just gets creamed by case.
I then Logan's Logan's dad of all people

769
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:28,960
come out and try to defend him.
It's like,

770
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:33,961
Dude,
his dad is crunchy as fuck and it's just

771
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:37,420
like a shit show.
It's just so embarrassing.

772
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,150
You know what Logan's thinking?
He's like,

773
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:40,990
dude,
this is my,

774
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,570
this may well be my last chance to make 
money.

775
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,400
Okay,

776
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,233
so I'm going to ignore this.
I wonder how much they both making from 

777
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:49,600
this.
I want to crunch some numbers right now.

778
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,890
Let's crunch numbers.
I think there's 20,000

779
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:55,150
seats.
I don't think they're going to sell it.

780
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:55,984
I think maybe they'll sell.
Let's be generous and say they sell 

781
00:38:58,241 --> 00:38:59,380
10,000
seats.

782
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,020
Okay.
10,000.

783
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:05,410
Let's say it's 100 on average per 
ticket.

784
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,550
And they get let's,
let's just do revenue right now.

785
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:09,384
Okay.
There wasn't charging a hundred fucking 

786
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,003
dollars.
I can do this thing.

787
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,350
Yeah,
she's,

788
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,523
so that's a million.
But then they're doing paper view and 

789
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:18,610
all this bullshit.
They'll have a lot of live streamers.

790
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,811
I know.
How many,

791
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:21,850
how many paper view tickets can they 
sell this?

792
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:24,490
I don't know.
Not that much.

793
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,260
10,000.
I mean,

794
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:27,910
I don't know.
Right

795
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,460
for the online,
isn't it online thing?

796
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,383
Yeah,
it's a online page charging for that 

797
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,120
too.
Wow.

798
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,140
Um,
they'll still more than 10,000,

799
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,530
let's say it's 25 for the stream.
So what do you think they sell?

800
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,250
I mean,
I,

801
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,550
okay,
let's say 50 that seems generous,

802
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,740
but maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it's a hundred I don't know.

803
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,140
50,000
that's another,

804
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,950
I mean,
you're looking at 2 million.

805
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,033
Not Bad for the venue gets half.
You're down to a million split between 

806
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:00,684
the two of them.
I feel like this calculation can't be 

807
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:03,144
right.
I feel like they got to be making more 

808
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:05,970
money from this.
You know,

809
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,930
it's $14 for an online ticket.
It looks like dude,

810
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,300
they're fucking not making that much 
money from this.

811
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,850
He's humiliating himself for like a 
hundred I mean,

812
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,820
maybe I'm out of touch a little bit.
Most people are like,

813
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,970
dude,
I would eat my own shit for $100,000

814
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,043
and you're right.

815
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,273
But like Mcgregor,
like mayweather got paid 300 million 

816
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:33,590
fucking dollars or something.
How much should he get for that fight?

817
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,953
I don't know.
Look it up.

818
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,800
I'm sure it's somewhere around there.
Like so you know,

819
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,693
in comparison,
which is what they're trying to do 

820
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,613
regardless is washes.
I am very curious how much money 

821
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:45,710
they're,
they're,

822
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,543
they're,
you know,

823
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:50,930
about to make from it.
If you can look that up,

824
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:51,540
let me know,
Dan.

825
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,373
Yeah,
I just pulled it up.

826
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,000
300 million for mayweather and conor 
Mcgregor.

827
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,590
Hundred around a hundred million.
I don't know.

828
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:58,424
Fuck.
Is there that much money in a single 

829
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:05,030
fight?
The fighters alone got $400 million.

830
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,450
What am I missing?
Well,

831
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:09,284
okay,
well what I'm missing is that that was 

832
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,234
like the fight of the century and 
probably like a million plus people 

833
00:41:14,061 --> 00:41:16,520
bought the paper view,
right?

834
00:41:16,521 --> 00:41:18,710
Yeah.
I mean it's two legends,

835
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,603
you know?
Uh,

836
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,490
KSI and Logan Paul.
I mean they're legends.

837
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:23,810
Bit of a,
of a different,

838
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,580
gosh,
I'm really care.

839
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,443
I don't see that many people buying the 
paper view because everyone is just 

840
00:41:28,731 --> 00:41:32,720
going to want to watch the highlights.
Just don't.

841
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,770
H three h three a live reaction stream 
built leg there.

842
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,010
Bootleg tape review.
That might be illegal.

843
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,850
Come at me fuckers.
No,

844
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:47,684
I'm not

845
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,293
right

846
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,770
this dick again.
Yeah.

847
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,250
You already did this dad.
Dude,

848
00:41:56,251 --> 00:42:01,251
come on the fuck off.
Oh,

849
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,493
you know what?

850
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:11,440
Let me just skip to the good parts,
which is basically he shits on him.

851
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,400
He shits on em.

852
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,060
Let's go.
Let's go.

853
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,220
Let's all doors.
Fuck.

854
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,660
I really liked when his dad gets 
involved.

855
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,500
You see everyone has,
everyone has my back.

856
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,180
Yeah,

857
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,650
you're an old man.
Okay.

858
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:36,540
Here's when the dad gets him in this.
This is disgusting.

859
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:39,510
Delusional Times.
He's not wrong.

860
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,800
You're disgusting man.

861
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,030
His Dad is there on stage.
Why is your dad there?

862
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:46,490
Doug?
You're trying to look bad ass.

863
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:49,340
Don't bring your fucking dad.
Who makes out with little girls?

864
00:42:49,341 --> 00:42:50,174
Yeah,
I was about to say this is the same dad 

865
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:52,550
that they got the keys.
He's like,

866
00:42:52,551 --> 00:42:53,384
you know what?
It'd be bad ass at this press 

867
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:58,760
conference.
My Dad don't judge a book by its cover.

868
00:42:59,150 --> 00:42:59,983
You fucking peasant ass.
Stewardist you know what's funny about 

869
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:04,994
Logan Paul?
He probably buys his data coach ticket 

870
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,580
cause they come here as like an 
entourage.

871
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:11,414
You know Logan Paul is the kind of dude 
who would buy himself a first class 

872
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:18,200
ticket in his dad's and coach.
Listen Dad,

873
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:19,034
you're not,
you're not a firstclass fuck boy like 

874
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:20,774
me.
All right,

875
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,150
you got to run this and dad,
the entourage is pretty big.

876
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,900
I'm going to have to stick you in coach.
All the way back next to the bathroom.

877
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,370
Don't judge a book by its cover,
Dude.

878
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,220
Don't you have a job?
How was this his,

879
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,830
how was his dad turned into his hype?
Man,

880
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,090
don't you have a job?

881
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,653
Okay.

882
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,580
He's like,
my son is really famous.

883
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:46,180
I'm going to ride his coattails and kiss
as many little 16 year olds as possible.

884
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:51,790
His Dad is like all in like he's Logan 
Paul's dad now.

885
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,440
Like he walks around and people are 
like,

886
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,303
Oh,
you're that guy that makes up a little 

887
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:57,220
girls and Jake Paul's channel.
Yeah.

888
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,013
Anyway,

889
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:07,340
do premium premium.
The fuck you want to do?

890
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:10,770
Shit,
you're an old man.

891
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,950
I mean,
that's just factual.

892
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,570
He's like,
you're an old man.

893
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,673
It's not really even how to install it.
Just like we're not an equal fighting 

894
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:22,900
match.
You're an old man,

895
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:25,970
so yeah,
that is true.

896
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,153
I'm so,
I'm so you wouldn't mind lots of one on 

897
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,270
the phone.
A little.

898
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,103
She like kissing so good.
He's fucking dad is getting roasted 

899
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:39,841
team.
Paul,

900
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:41,040
look,
he wants to get in there.

901
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:46,580
You sit dead bald headed prick.
I like this guy is I,

902
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,373
to be honest.

903
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,540
Oh yeah.
Oh,

904
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:51,374
by the way,
look at Jake Paul on the top left 

905
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:54,590
looking like Elton John.
Bro.

906
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,210
What the fuck?
The eighties called?

907
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,660
You see him?
No,

908
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,900
you see him right here.
Look at this.

909
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,480
The,
he looks like he looks like night at the

910
00:45:05,481 --> 00:45:07,040
Roxbury.
His ass looking fuck.

911
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,040
Hold on.
Let's take it full screen.

912
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:11,450
Do you not see this?

913
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,230
My crazy?
No,

914
00:45:15,231 --> 00:45:16,100
you're not crazy,
jake.

915
00:45:16,101 --> 00:45:18,490
Paul's looking like he's out for the 
night of the Roxbury's.

916
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,560
Dude,
that's the one that's minimized as it is

917
00:45:21,561 --> 00:45:23,450
it viewable on the stream though?
We can't see it.

918
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:25,760
It's like cut off for don't fucks it up.
Hold on.

919
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,260
No,
this is important,

920
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,550
but there is,
you can't see full screen.

921
00:45:31,551 --> 00:45:34,310
Where you mean it was just crop.
It just the very,

922
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:37,070
cause he's right on the edge.
It was just cut off ever so slightly.

923
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,180
We see it now.
Okay.

924
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,433
Why does it look like Jake?
Paul is about to drop the corneas 80 

925
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:47,921
single right now.
[inaudible] damn.

926
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,700
The whole team is just,
that's a whole bunch of winners,

927
00:45:55,701 --> 00:45:58,610
right?
Jake Paul,

928
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:00,080
dude,
I can't get over this luck.

929
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,830
He's not even there.
He's like out in outer space.

930
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:10,180
He's like,
zone the fuck out.

931
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,400
He's like watching cartoons in his head 
right now.

932
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:17,820
Blue tinted glasses night at the Roxbury
ass looking fuck.

933
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:20,800
Okay.

934
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,460
I think maybe he's just like reflecting 
on how embarrassed he is of his dad.

935
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,030
Do you have that kind of know his dad's,
his role model.

936
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,030
Tim Paul,
Tom as children.

937
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:41,470
Here we go.
You want to ask you about ask your mom.

938
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:45,403
Got Him

939
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:47,740
fucking God.
Get Him Dad.

940
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,860
My Dad got you.
Good.

941
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,533
Yeah.

942
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,680
Yeah.
What the fuck?

943
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,150
My Dad just burned you.

944
00:46:58,890 --> 00:46:59,520
Okay.

945
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,440
Hey Dad,
you want to take care of the Hey dad,

946
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:03,240
you want to get the mic can take care of
this.

947
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,800
Hey Dad,
this Guy Ksi.

948
00:47:05,801 --> 00:47:07,860
He's Talkin Shit.
You want to get take care of this.

949
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,610
What does he do?
What does his dad do?

950
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:18,730
I wonder like what's his job now?
Probably nothing right now,

951
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:22,890
but he's clearly,
he's clearly,

952
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,990
I wonder what's his job within the 
organization?

953
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:28,410
You know what I mean?
Got Jake.

954
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:31,480
Paul is such a phony.
He looks like someone who's trying to be

955
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:32,870
someone else.
I don't know,

956
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,330
whatever.

957
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,980
He's a commercial roofer and licensed 
realtor.

958
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:36,500
You're ready.

959
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,333
Oh,
he is.

960
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,243
All right.
It just looked it up according to 

961
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,110
priceless.
He is.

962
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,610
He is a realtor.
They honestly,

963
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,620
frankly,
all these Polish should be realtors.

964
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,990
Like I was talking last episode about 
like why Youtube makes people famous.

965
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:52,470
You have no right to be these Paul 
brothers have a law.

966
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,353
They have a legacy and being realtors,
they should have a realtor family 

967
00:47:56,781 --> 00:47:59,690
business or are they all just selling 
houses in Ohio?

968
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:01,763
Should be on a bus stops.
I can see Logan Paul with a receding 

969
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:07,460
hairline.
He's at a house,

970
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,830
you know,
a couple hours for the client shows up.

971
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,480
He's cleaning,
making sure it's nice.

972
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,693
Yeah.
There's all three of their faces on a 

973
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,760
bus stop and a little murky.
Yeah.

974
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,560
The question I said,
let's do some questions.

975
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,050
Don't throw anything.
Calm down.

976
00:48:21,051 --> 00:48:21,570
All right.

977
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:24,680
I know.
Hey,

978
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,180
I'm gonna be honest.

979
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:32,070
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

980
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,250
He looks like he's heartbroken right 
now.

981
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,770
Fuck you.
Loca he looks like a broken man.

982
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:45,970
Did how you feel about,
is that lip?

983
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,080
How's that lit?
Hey,

984
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:51,920
I was here and answer your questions.
All right.

985
00:48:51,921 --> 00:48:56,921
I feel like Ksi address everything.
I'm out August 25th Oh,

986
00:48:58,801 --> 00:49:00,510
you just Mike Bale's.
Yeah,

987
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,280
exactly.
Case I've lived in.

988
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,330
Fuck.
Yeah,

989
00:49:11,331 --> 00:49:12,164
yeah,

990
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,400
exactly.
It was butter I think.

991
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,410
I think,
dude,

992
00:49:17,411 --> 00:49:18,880
he's not in a good place.
Logan.

993
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,620
I think he's,
yeah.

994
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,260
Anyway,
we talking about it.

995
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:24,670
He's,
he's gotta be so happy.

996
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,380
No,
but his dad's got his fucking back.

997
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,460
Yeah.
His Dad's got his back through thick and

998
00:49:30,461 --> 00:49:32,350
thin for sure.
And then on top of it,

999
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:33,184
BBC was at an interview with Logan to 
promote the fight and they tweeted this 

1000
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,310
out today.
We were going to hear from Logan,

1001
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:40,144
Paul and Ksi on their boxing match 
tonight after listening back to the 

1002
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:44,170
interview.
And we don't feel it's right.

1003
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,150
We understand some of your strong views 
on Logan,

1004
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:46,984
but ultimately we don't,
if we don't think the interview is good 

1005
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:50,740
enough,
we don't air it.

1006
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,590
They thought the interview,
they're like,

1007
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,380
it's not about that.
You guys don't like Logan.

1008
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,243
It's about that the interview sucked 
that this guy at nothing interesting to 

1009
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:05,170
say.
And so we didn't air it like this is the

1010
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:06,004
best burn ever.
That like we acknowledge that we all 

1011
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:12,511
hate him and that's not why we aired it.
We aired it because it sucked.

1012
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:18,030
Dick,
it's pretty brutal man.

1013
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:23,050
He would be a killer realtor though.
He could probably,

1014
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,250
yeah,
he would be killed realtor.

1015
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,290
I buy the trailer parks from him.
All right,

1016
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:27,920
well,
um,

1017
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:33,670
guys,
it's about that time for an episode of I

1018
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,020

00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:13,690

1027
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:17,170

That was not a good quality call and 

1039
00:51:50,261 --> 00:51:52,450

around.

1040

Okay,

Who is skippy's celebrity crush?
Is it a Emma Watson?

1066
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,720
Be Oprah Winfrey or c going old school?
Gwenyth paltrow a or c maybe.

1067
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,510
Seems like a classy man.
Yeah,

1068
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:19,360
that's a good guess.
She's a business lady.

1069
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:21,520
She's industrious.
She's got a lot going on.

1070
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,220
Dan,
is it c?

1071
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,400
My celebrity crash as the number one?
Uh,

1072
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:31,813
I think that Oprah is one of the most 
amazing people on the planet or any 

1073
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,760
celebrity.
It would be oprah.

1074
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,020
I want to be around Oprah.

1075
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,110
Wow.
He wants to be around Oprah.

1076
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:44,953
Wow.
I have to say that one was a little 

1077
00:53:47,231 --> 00:53:50,410
unexpected.
Skippy wants to Bang Oprah.

1078
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,140
That surprises me.
Franklin.

1079
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,780
Would it be my first choice?
Either,

1080
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,280
but I'm very good guess,
but don't worry you a former questions.

1081
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:07,270
There's still time.
Let's move it on to question two.

1082
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,550
How are you feeling?
Are you ready?

1083
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:10,740
Are you prepared?
I,

1084
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:11,741
yeah,
I'm,

1085
00:54:11,741 --> 00:54:13,600
I'm pretty prepared.
I think your weight,

1086
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:16,120
you're almost too calm,
but that's okay.

1087
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,410
Okay.
How many girls has skippy kissed?

1088
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,240
Zero.
A.

1089
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:23,240
Okay.

1090
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:28,190
B Nine or c?
49.

1091
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,370
I'm going to go with B.
Wow.

1092
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:34,380
No hesitation.
What?

1093
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:35,100
What,
what?

1094
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,900
What makes you think that?
It's 49.

1095
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,240
I know he's gotten to a second and a 
half base.

1096
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,620
Really?
A couple of times.

1097
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,413
Okay.

1098
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:48,510
She eats cheese and she watches skippy.
I love it.

1099
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:50,290
Fuck yeah.
Okay guys,

1100
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:51,490
that's the life.
Dan,

1101
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,050
you ready?
Go ahead.

1102
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,100
How many girls have eyecare?
Plenty.

1103
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,380
That's a really easy thing for me to 
remember.

1104
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:01,140
It's 49.
It's warm.

1105
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,243
Yeah.

1106
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,403
Excellent.
I got to say that shocked me when I 

1107
00:55:10,431 --> 00:55:12,890
heard he had kissed 49 cuties.
I was like,

1108
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,900
damn,
skippy is fucking like crazy.

1109
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,063
Like if he wasn't a mormon,
he would be like probably have stds 

1110
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,060
still mag.
Would you get skippy?

1111
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,050
Okay.

1112
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,420
Uh,
I would give that a soft.

1113
00:55:27,421 --> 00:55:28,080
Maybe

1114
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,170
you give him a peck.
Hmm.

1115
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:32,400
Yeah.
You give them a soft,

1116
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:33,720
what does that mean?
Like a soft kiss?

1117
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,040
Yeah.

1118
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,580
Uh,
I,

1119
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:39,070
it would be like a,
I feel sorry for you a little bit.

1120
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,210
We can't make it to the next stage.
Not the type.

1121
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,610
Who's your consolation prize?

1122
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,673
Do you,
are you attracted to men who picked 

1123
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:48,630
belly button lint out of their stomach 
and keep it in a jar by their bed?

1124
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,190
No,
I would have to say probably not.

1125
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,140
Well,
I find that a little bit judgmental,

1126
00:55:54,141 --> 00:55:54,960
Sarah,
but,

1127
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,740
but you are your own person and I don't 
judge you.

1128
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:00,220
You've got one point on the board.
Hey,

1129
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,020
so excellent.
Here we go.

1130
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:04,933
Question number three,
what's the furthest Bay skippy has 

1131
00:56:08,361 --> 00:56:09,194
gotten too?

1132
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:11,983
Hey,

1133
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,320
second and a half.
In other words,

1134
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:17,154
he's,
he's fingered girls and he's got his 

1135
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:19,560
dick touched as well.

1136
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,240
Oh,

1137
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:22,263
third base

1138
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,290
oral or first base,
which is,

1139
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,310
you know,
just a peck.

1140
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,370
He seem to know a lot about.
Yeah.

1141
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,970
Okay.
I hear you describing the basis,

1142
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,990
the basis.
Um,

1143
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,740
I think it's a,
I think it's a,

1144
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,690
you sound confident.
No hesitation.

1145
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,520
Nope.
Zero hesitation.

1146
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,470
Knocking around the skippy knowledge.
Wow.

1147
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,020
You're good.
Well,

1148
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,650
I like to,
I liked when the music gets tense.

1149
00:56:51,651 --> 00:56:52,790
I feel like you're not giving me a 
chance.

1150
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,221
Like,
you know,

1151
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:55,700
you got to let the tension build.
You're too confident.

1152
00:56:55,701 --> 00:56:57,560
You're too quiet.
Oh my bad.

1153
00:56:57,561 --> 00:56:58,820
Okay.
I'll wait for the next one.

1154
00:56:58,970 --> 00:56:59,803
Nobody.
You could be yourself but also don't be 

1155
00:57:01,611 --> 00:57:05,600
yourself to make the show better,
Dan.

1156
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,063
The answer is

1157
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,160
done.
Well,

1158
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,010
let's just put it there.

1159
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:15,700
Okay.
I was going between second and third,

1160
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,070
but I ended up getting tagged out by the
sheriff.

1161
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:20,680
Stopped.
I'd been touched in the side

1162
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:25,830
but haven't quite gotten the fat where 
mountains on body parts had gotten her.

1163
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,090
I get it.
I guess I have

1164
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,560
the say your knowledge of skippy.
You got your all,

1165
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,890
you've got two points on the board.
I may give it up,

1166
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:39,500
man.
It's the second he must say that because

1167
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,300
you haven't mentioned this,
that yeah,

1168
00:57:41,301 --> 00:57:43,580
you knew right away.
Uh,

1169
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,750
I may or may not have brushed up on my 
skippy knowledge.

1170
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:51,730
Oh,
you're an advanced player.

1171
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:54,610
I,
I definitely tip my beanie to you now.

1172
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:56,800
He said he's gotten that second and a 
half base.

1173
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:59,140
If you had to imagine,
what do you think that would necessarily

1174
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:01,530
mean?
Uh,

1175
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,150
like his dick out a little bit wet,
but not crazy way.

1176
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,720
Little like a little kiss,
like a little kid.

1177
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,080
Interesting.
A little bit kiss here.

1178
00:58:09,081 --> 00:58:10,220
Can I do a,
uh,

1179
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,173
can I do,
there's gotta be a sound effect for 

1180
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:13,124
that.

1181
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,400
Yeah,
I imagine you're right.

1182
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:23,430
Probably got a little bit wet and to 
that I said once again,

1183
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,583
skip that you really surprising me.
If it wasn't for this a little warming 

1184
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,740
thing,
he would just be fucking like crazy.

1185
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:32,030
He's crushing it honestly.
I know.

1186
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,550
I love the image of him being stopped 
between bases.

1187
00:58:36,551 --> 00:58:38,140
Like he got,
he got tagged out.

1188
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,033
He was in,
he's having a pickle and probably came 

1189
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:42,040
downstairs.
Yeah,

1190
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:44,020
that might be actually accurate.
What happened?

1191
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,120
Your left.
All right.

1192
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,360
Just once for all the tamales.

1193
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:56,543
Oh Man.
What's the most trouble skips trouble 

1194
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:04,770
skippy has ever gotten with his bishop?
We've taught,

1195
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:09,771
heard him talk about his bishop.
This is the man at his church who passes

1196
00:59:09,781 --> 00:59:10,614
judgment on him.
He's basically the gatekeeper to the 

1197
00:59:13,201 --> 00:59:15,440
afterlife.
Right,

1198
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:16,380
right.
So a,

1199
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:18,893
um,
he got in trouble for all the handies 

1200
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,793
he's been getting

1201
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,430
no,

1202
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,660
as we,
as we've called it,

1203
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:24,494
rounding the third base,
but being struck out for masturbating 

1204
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:29,414
too much or see getting drunk,
which is strictly against the Mormon 

1205
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:37,070
faith.
Sarah,

1206
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:39,973
what is your oh boy.
I think deeply and the mind of the 

1207
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:50,441
Mormon enter the mind of the virgin.
I would say it's probably masturbating,

1208
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,290
masturbating too much.

1209
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:02,300
Very nice and very,
very good gas.

1210
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:08,260
I would guess that he masturbates at 
least seven times a day at least.

1211
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:11,573
Dan,

1212
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,320
is it masturbating too much,
John

1213
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:15,263
to second base with multiple girls?
I got if we're using the baseball 

1214
01:00:21,001 --> 01:00:22,470
analogy,
I uh,

1215
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:27,500
got sidelined by my bishop and was told 
not to take the communion for awhile.

1216
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,900
So in the Mormon church they call it 
being disfellowshipped.

1217
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,190
This fella

1218
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:35,870
shipped.
It is sadly,

1219
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,240
he had a great,
great guess.

1220
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,083
You had a great guess.
He probably does masturbate a lot to 

1221
01:00:42,591 --> 01:00:44,000
that.
I would give you all the credit,

1222
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,043
but it was actually from all the handies
he was getting and he got 

1223
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:51,450
disfellowshipped,
which is a word that makes me giggle.

1224
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,760
Um,
I love it.

1225
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,730
But this is okay.
This last question.

1226
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,280
Everything rides on this question.
It's two to two.

1227
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,620
This is,
we are on the board to,

1228
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:02,700
to,
to the tents.

1229
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,680
Music is on now.
Sarah,

1230
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,120
what kind of phone are you using 
currently?

1231
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:13,030
I am using a Google Pixel that has a 
very craft screen.

1232
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,300
Oh,
so this is,

1233
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:16,040
this has been,
because this is big.

1234
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,400
Let me tell you what's on the line here.
Okay.

1235
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:24,130
This is a brand new s nine plus.
This is the best phone on the market.

1236
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,890
There's no question about it.
And let me tell you what else.

1237
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,580
What else do you think it has my dna on 
it.

1238
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,320
Ooh,
don't clone you.

1239
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,130
Terrific.
Okay,

1240
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:39,480
I won't.
Sorry.

1241
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,300
35 okay,
here we go.

1242
01:01:42,301 --> 01:01:46,560
The question to decide at all

1243
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:47,990
what?

1244
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:49,700
Ooh,

1245
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,890
what kind of collection did skippy give 
us?

1246
01:01:53,891 --> 01:01:58,891
The auction for charity.
Was it a toe nail clippings be eyelashes

1247
01:01:59,831 --> 01:02:01,690
or see belly button.

1248
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:04,413
It was definitely fee and smelled like 
your grandmother's closet here and one 

1249
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:13,960
of the cooler things I get that I did.
I was,

1250
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,540
I was drawing it out.
I didn't say go.

1251
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,060
I played it early.
Dan,

1252
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,670
you heard the drama.
You play it.

1253
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:23,030
The symbol.
Do you,

1254
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,420
when you hear this my entire life,
don't you play when you did the symbol?

1255
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,150
I'm not.
I'm describing.

1256
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:32,010
I did.
Don't get technical.

1257
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:36,390
You know what I mean?
That doesn't mean play.

1258
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,350
I'm just telling you when I hit that.
All right.

1259
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:41,460
Yeah.
What is the answer?

1260
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:42,870
One of the cooler

1261
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,793
planes that ever happened in my entire 
life was when my belly button link 

1262
01:02:48,461 --> 01:02:53,461
collection of almost 20 years was given 
to h three h three

1263
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:01,060
what's the greatest,
greatest fall on the market?

1264
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:06,330
How are you feeling right now?
I am so excited.

1265
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:07,600
Oh,
I'm happy to hear that.

1266
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:09,580
Do you have anyone that you want to 
think?

1267
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:12,243
Uh,
I'd like to think it's my baby girl for 

1268
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:17,380
sleeping during this entire process.
God bless her.

1269
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,160
God bless her.
What a sweet Angela.

1270
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,540
Oh,
Dan told him to kill the music.

1271
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:24,840
I guess that was not really that great.
It's just a little louder.

1272
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:27,240
Um,
Sarah,

1273
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:30,240
you're the greatest.
You don't want a new phone.

1274
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,980
Stay on the line.
We're going to hook you up.

1275
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,100
Thank you for calling in and God will 
look good.

1276
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:35,801
Yep.
Thank you.

1277
01:03:35,801 --> 01:03:37,110
Yep.
Appreciate Ya.

1278
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:37,801
All right,
Papa.

1279
01:03:37,801 --> 01:03:38,910
Bless Papa.
Bless.

1280
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,480
Do I need to mute her?
Something down?

1281
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:43,261
Yeah,
just put her,

1282
01:03:43,261 --> 01:03:44,094
uh,
don't,

1283
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:45,930
don't,
don't take this personally,

1284
01:03:45,931 --> 01:03:48,690
Sarah,
but I get it.

1285
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,100
You're muted.
Shut up Dan.

1286
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:54,600
You got it.
I'm doing,

1287
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,190
I'm doing drum out here.
I know I milk.

1288
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,710
I'm doing drama.
You can't just be,

1289
01:03:58,711 --> 01:04:01,350
you can't willy nilly just play sound 
whenever you want.

1290
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,100
Oh,
unbelievable.

1291
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,960
You hear this?
That's drama.

1292
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,633
I didn't hit the center of the civil.
Where'd the money went for hurricane 

1293
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:09,150
relief?
I hear the symbol,

1294
01:04:09,151 --> 01:04:09,260
right.

1295
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,840
Play.
Not Kidding,

1296
01:04:11,841 --> 01:04:13,640
dude.
Anyway.

1297
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,620
That was fun.
That was a good time.

1298
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,860
Sarah was a great color.
There was a great guy.

1299
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,340
I love this.
I love this segment.

1300
01:04:19,341 --> 01:04:24,341
It's so much fun that my dna on it send 
any into uh,

1301
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,200
get her info.
I was great.

1302
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:29,540
And that was so much fun.
Who should we do next?

1303
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:32,900
I wonder.
So we actually,

1304
01:04:32,901 --> 01:04:34,090
this show is,
uh,

1305
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:35,773
let's just do the Roseanne.
I mean I've got a lot of great stuff 

1306
01:04:37,491 --> 01:04:40,250
here,
but I kind of want to go over it with,

1307
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:43,540
with Ila.
Um,

1308
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,593
one thing in particular I really want to
talk about is that we talked previously 

1309
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:48,613
that mean either trying to have kids.
So I want to do a semen analysis and I 

1310
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,000
was,
it was,

1311
01:04:53,001 --> 01:04:56,330
the room was unbelievable where you 
going there and squirting a cup.

1312
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,070
I was taking pictures and videos of this
room because it's like you can't imagine

1313
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:01,904
what's going on in there,
but I want to wait until Ila sitting 

1314
01:05:03,891 --> 01:05:07,310
across from me so she can,
you need to see her reaction to this.

1315
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:10,670
So there's a lot of stuff I want to talk
about,

1316
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,010
but I want to close up the show with 
Roseanne.

1317
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:16,880
You guys have heard about Roseanne,
the situation of her calling.

1318
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,470
I don't remember if this lady,
she said she looked like a monkey.

1319
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:27,180
Shar show got canceled.
So she's finally issued an explanation.

1320
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:29,103
She's finally issued a statement,
an apology of sorts that I think clears 

1321
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:36,160
everything up.
And I think you guys will all agree.

1322
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:40,450
So in her own words.

1323
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:42,970
Hello?
Hello?

1324
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:45,490
Hello?
Hello?

1325
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:46,323
Hello?
Hello.

1326
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:47,970
Is it loud enough out there,
Dan?

1327
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:51,150
I don't want to hear.
Yeah,

1328
01:05:51,151 --> 01:05:52,500
no,
it's fine.

1329
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:55,800
Cause it only she's Mike.
Everybody else is just getting ambient.

1330
01:05:55,801 --> 01:05:57,090
So once she starts talking and listen.

1331
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,740
All right.
All right.

1332
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:04,760
I get frustrated with Dan.
We have sound issues and I yell at Dan,

1333
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,990
you guys have any sound issues with the 
unbalanced or itchy weird shit?

1334
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:11,090
Emailed Dan and give him,
give him hell.

1335
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,453
Okay.

1336
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:17,350
Sounds good.
We don't have chat anymore,

1337
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:19,720
so we don't even know for fucking up 
anymore.

1338
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,190
By the way,
this figurine and another video,

1339
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:26,380
she explains that this is a statue of 
her body.

1340
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,000
Oh,
maybe skippy's into that.

1341
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,920
Maybe.
Maybe d Roseanne would be,

1342
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:37,940
that kind of surprises me that skippy 
wants to fuck oprah does.

1343
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:41,020
I know the figurine with your mouse.
I just took it full screen right here.

1344
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,760
Yeah,
there she is.

1345
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,100
Does it surprise you that skippy wants 
to fuck oprah?

1346
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,690
I mean that's kind of cool.
He's like,

1347
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,330
Damn,
you know what?

1348
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:50,110
I want to fucking,
you know who I want around third base on

1349
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,063
Oprah.
I wonder what's very surprised when he 

1350
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,540
said that.
What base is ass play?

1351
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,633
Cause that then that's the dugout.
The metaphor kind of breaks down cause 

1352
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:07,930
it's like ask plays almost more advanced
than a home run in a way.

1353
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:10,810
In most circles.
Anyway.

1354
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:13,810
So I wonder if skippy's ever fingered an
asshole.

1355
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:17,403
I don't wonder that.
Why do I hear him talking in the 

1356
01:07:18,941 --> 01:07:21,340
background?
I was that Ian,

1357
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,370
that must be in through your mic.
All right,

1358
01:07:24,371 --> 01:07:25,690
look at Sarah's info.
Okay.

1359
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:29,110
All right.
Well anyway,

1360
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:34,110
as digression in her own words,
here's Roseanne explaining.

1361
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,410
Okay.
How's it sound?

1362
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:37,770
I don't know.
Hello.

1363
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,220
Hello?
Hello?

1364
01:07:40,221 --> 01:07:40,941
Hello,
hello,

1365
01:07:40,941 --> 01:07:42,020
hello.
Okay.

1366
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:48,160
And you said I'm in three outfits or 
niche.

1367
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:49,740
Here's the problem,
like imagine,

1368
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,330
are you filming?
Yes.

1369
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:52,853
Imagine a presidential address.
Like you're busted with a killing a 

1370
01:07:55,021 --> 01:07:58,290
hooker,
like just no hear me out.

1371
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:59,543
And they say tonight the president is 
going to give his address and then the 

1372
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:02,724
camera fades out and it's fucking the 
president on his desk in the Oval 

1373
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,110
Office.
And he's like,

1374
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,270
I do not have sex with that hooker.
Right.

1375
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,333
Um,
imagine in his statement the keep and 

1376
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:14,580
save his job.
There were jump cuts,

1377
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:15,920
multiple outfits,

1378
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:20,390
difference.
I'm trying to talk about,

1379
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,640
you've told me this $300.
Do you know that?

1380
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:26,803
That's what my tweet was about.
I know you've explained this literally 

1381
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,520
was why I thought the bridge was why.

1382
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,730
So that clears it up.

1383
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,353
Wow.

1384
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,110
So there's like,
there's a lot of interesting things here

1385
01:08:46,111 --> 01:08:47,220
about this field.
First of all,

1386
01:08:47,221 --> 01:08:51,660
this is on her,
this is on her official youtube channel.

1387
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:53,933
This was uploaded by her,
her directly deliver on the Dan Barker 

1388
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:58,523
Channel.
Let's see.

1389
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:00,503
Anyway,
this is probably my favorite clip to 

1390
01:09:02,941 --> 01:09:07,620
come out of this whole possibly year 
2018 this might be the strongest clip of

1391
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:10,720
the whole year.
Roseanne,

1392
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,300
what do you have to say in your defense

1393
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:15,880
job?
There were jump cuts.

1394
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,890
You've told me this 300 times.

1395
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,080
What is wrong with her?
She's like,

1396
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:25,540
I don't think she's on drugs,
but like my God,

1397
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:30,541
she's like breaking down just like 
Christ.

1398
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:35,170
He doesn't look good.
This was posted this this previous week,

1399
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,580
right?
This is very recent.

1400
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:40,150
You think it was recorded recently or 
was this right after the incident?

1401
01:09:40,151 --> 01:09:40,360
No,
no,

1402
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,170
no.
This is,

1403
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:44,910
maybe this is,
this is after some thoughtful after some

1404
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,110
reflection,
but like the question is,

1405
01:09:47,111 --> 01:09:50,170
well here after some after,
I love this.

1406
01:09:50,171 --> 01:09:51,004
This is so good.
After some careful consideration and 

1407
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:57,730
some thoughtful reflection,
Rosanne has decided to issue a statement

1408
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,890
on her controversial tweets.

1409
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:04,720
That's what my point was about.
I know you've explained this.

1410
01:10:04,721 --> 01:10:05,554
Literally.
That was why I thought the bridge was 

1411
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:13,163
why.

1412
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,590
Now I've got an interesting question for
you.

1413
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:22,120
Do you think this in a way,
does this help her?

1414
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:23,350
No.
Okay.

1415
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:24,911
Why?
Almost?

1416
01:10:24,911 --> 01:10:27,190
I'm more inclined to believe her because
she's like,

1417
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:30,200
she's very passionate about,
she's very passionate about it or I'm,

1418
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,040
I'm somewhat inclined to believe that,
um,

1419
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:34,443
that it,
it wasn't necessarily coming from a 

1420
01:10:35,591 --> 01:10:36,424
place of,

1421
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:38,950
he's done

1422
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:40,750
prove that statement.
That's a strong statement.

1423
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:41,613
However,
I'm also inclined to believe that she's 

1424
01:10:43,091 --> 01:10:44,020
a fucking psycho.

1425
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:50,870
What makes you think that?
What makes you say at all,

1426
01:10:53,311 --> 01:10:54,144
Dan?
Dan,

1427
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,030
I don't know.
Just something,

1428
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,380
something,
something about,

1429
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:58,490
well,
and she goes about it.

1430
01:10:58,491 --> 01:10:59,570
I don't know.
Anyway,

1431
01:10:59,571 --> 01:11:00,710
guys,
um,

1432
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:04,250
you know,
I just thought that there's really a lot

1433
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:05,084
of value here.
I thought this was a great clip and I 

1434
01:11:08,811 --> 01:11:10,190
thought,
well,

1435
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:11,300
let me,
let me,

1436
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,110
let me draft this in a,
in another way.

1437
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:32,693
Why?

1438
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,110
And for those reasons,
amount.

1439
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,930
I've been waiting,
I do that for a long time.

1440
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:43,030
I got this soundbite here is I have 
another one.

1441
01:11:43,031 --> 01:11:43,960
The angels in heaven.

1442
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,880
Oh,

1443
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,350
I think the curb ones better.

1444
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:06,743
Why?

1445
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:15,190
I love that soundboard.
Oh,

1446
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:17,190
you're a conductor,
dude.

1447
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:20,080
I feel like,
I feel like a Dj for the first time.

1448
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:24,600
Yeah.
But here actually,

1449
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:25,463
this is fine.
This is like right when they start 

1450
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:28,680
rolling.
That was like her off the cuff thing.

1451
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:31,860
Have you ever seen someone famous so 
unhinged in your life?

1452
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:33,420
I think it,
what's so fascinating about it?

1453
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,860
I thought that bitch was,
why

1454
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:39,250
does that,
whoa.

1455
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,460
All right.
It's crazy to see anybody that unhinged,

1456
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:45,340
but it does kind of give you an insight 
to how,

1457
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:50,140
how fucked up he is kind of in a way.
It's like Whoa,

1458
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:53,230
probably shouldn't have been working on 
that show to begin with,

1459
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:54,110
you know?

1460
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:54,943
Yeah.

1461
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:58,980
That's where you're at mentally.
You know what I'm saying?

1462
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:04,110
I thought that was wow.
It was why

1463
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:09,820
God damn fucking open a portal.
That shit.

1464
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:11,290
It's kind of what that is,
isn't it?

1465
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,230
Um,
but so then take too,

1466
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:15,933
she gets her shit together by the way.
What the fuck are they put that on our 

1467
01:13:18,371 --> 01:13:19,300
official channel,
man,

1468
01:13:19,301 --> 01:13:22,150
I just loved that so much.
So this is her actual,

1469
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,760
you know,
real statement on it

1470
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:25,693
bar.
And I'd like to welcome you to my own 

1471
01:13:28,081 --> 01:13:28,914
studio,
to my fellow and sister Americans 

1472
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,393
without the filter of the biased media.
That's my statement from the very 

1473
01:13:40,441 --> 01:13:41,274
beginning.
And it will continue to be one abc 

1474
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:51,740
called and asked me to explain my gray,
just an unforgettable tweet.

1475
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:53,873
I told them I thought Valerie Jarrett 
was white and I'm willing to go on the 

1476
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:01,854
BW,
Jimmy Kimmel or whatever other show you 

1477
01:14:03,901 --> 01:14:04,734
want me to go on to my audience.
Now what happened with about 40 minutes 

1478
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,423
after that,
my show was canceled before even one 

1479
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:18,190
advertiser pulled out and I was labeled 
a racist.

1480
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,340
Why you ask?
Well,

1481
01:14:21,341 --> 01:14:22,174
the answer is simple.
It's because I voted for Donald Trump 

1482
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,500
and that is not allowed in Hollywood.

1483
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:28,520
Pretty Shitty.
Well,

1484
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:29,550
okay,
so ma'am,

1485
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:31,013
well first of all wasn't the whole 
premise of the show that she was like a 

1486
01:14:33,901 --> 01:14:38,450
trump voter and like so clearly,
obviously not that they get away,

1487
01:14:38,451 --> 01:14:39,284
they gave you the show because you were 
a trump supporter because they thought 

1488
01:14:41,161 --> 01:14:44,190
it was an interesting dynamic.
Right.

1489
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,280
So that doesn't make sense.
Although I do,

1490
01:14:47,281 --> 01:14:48,114
I actually do believe that she thought 
she was white because I've seen a 

1491
01:14:50,131 --> 01:14:53,490
picture and the lady doesn't,
she my first guest wouldn't be black.

1492
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,680
And I mean if you can elicit,
yeah,

1493
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,820
this response was,
why?

1494
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,480
That's,
but at any rate,

1495
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:06,481
she's,
I don't know if let's say,

1496
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,790
let's say if she did think she was 
white,

1497
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:12,760
then is the tweet and like,
how bad is the tweet still?

1498
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:15,580
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1499
01:15:15,581 --> 01:15:16,414
I mean,
obviously it doesn't have the whole 

1500
01:15:17,831 --> 01:15:21,760
connotation of calling a black person a 
monkey that everyone thought it did.

1501
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:24,460
So it's not as bad.
Like the context does help,

1502
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,870
but it's still,
she's unhinged it,

1503
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:29,440
she,
she,

1504
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:34,120
she was probably on thin ice already at 
the end of the executives at ABC because

1505
01:15:34,121 --> 01:15:36,670
she'd just nonstop was ranting on 
twitter about it.

1506
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:36,810
Okay.

1507
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:37,643
Nine Times.

1508
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:40,980
Right.
And can you imagine working with that?

1509
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:41,933
I mean,
I'm sure that's not an isolated 

1510
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:45,210
incident.
Yeah.

1511
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,460
I actually,
I think what happened,

1512
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,250
I'm like you said,
it's probably that they were like,

1513
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,000
all right,
like,

1514
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,260
enough,
this is Nikki.

1515
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,850
Yeah.
This,

1516
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:56,040
this is not going to get better.
But see,

1517
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:58,140
I mean,
just to kind of line that up in a way,

1518
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,193
how did you,

1519
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:01,023
MMM,

1520
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:02,683
here's a clip again,
this is all on our personal youtube 

1521
01:16:05,301 --> 01:16:07,010
channel,
which is just so fascinating to me.

1522
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:08,623
But,
um,

1523
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:10,971
here,
here,

1524
01:16:10,971 --> 01:16:11,804
here's a little soundbite they uploaded 
right before they started shooting the 

1525
01:16:16,581 --> 01:16:17,630
first season of her new

1526
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:18,563
shut.
How did you,

1527
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,880
you're so fucking tired.
How did you do this for 10 years?

1528
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,900
Are you shitting me?
I lost my fucking mind.

1529
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,110
I lost my marriage.
I had locked my phone.

1530
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,320
The kids drop our marriage and get wad 
and a fucking half and one bro.

1531
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:32,603
The fuck do you think both at the 
hospitalized for four different nervous 

1532
01:16:35,761 --> 01:16:37,290
breakdown?
That's how I did it.

1533
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,790
Thanks for asking.

1534
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:43,170
That's actually great.
It's pretty wild,

1535
01:16:43,171 --> 01:16:44,760
man.
She's a fucking character.

1536
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:46,260
You know what,
Rosanne,

1537
01:16:46,261 --> 01:16:47,010
she's such a,

1538
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:49,810
I thought that was why.

1539
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:53,910
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1540
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,940
It's so hard to say,
you know,

1541
01:16:54,941 --> 01:16:56,770
with the,
sorry to say,

1542
01:16:56,771 --> 01:16:59,980
but either way,
we've got this wonderful sound bite that

1543
01:16:59,981 --> 01:17:00,814
I think will truly live in infamy.
I don't see this going anywhere off my 

1544
01:17:03,851 --> 01:17:04,710
soundboard for a while.

1545
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:07,830
That was why

1546
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,830
so good.
Um,

1547
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,500
like I said,
let's see what else we've got here.

1548
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,810
We've got a,
we've got all this stuff.

1549
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,360
We've got some great shit.
I'm gonna save this though.

1550
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:19,820
We've got the news.
We should just hit the news if the news,

1551
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:20,703
but before we do hit the news,
we're going to bring back the news by 

1552
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,560
the way,
but before we do,

1553
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,233
hi.

1554
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:43,180
All right.
Maybe it's just me having fun.

1555
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:44,343
There's a possibility that there's 
thousands of people watching right now 

1556
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:51,490
and saying,
please stop fucking doing that.

1557
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:55,120
I'm having a great time though.
All right,

1558
01:17:55,121 --> 01:17:55,960
Dan,
give us the news.

1559
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:57,640
All right.
Hit Him with the Stinger.

1560
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,600
Oh God.

1561
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:18,160
All right,
let's do the news.

1562
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:20,960
Everybody.
You got to flip your TV.

1563
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:24,040
It's rather a input by the way,
so you can follow along.

1564
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:24,874
Right?
Right.

1565
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,860
All right,
so,

1566
01:18:26,861 --> 01:18:29,770
um,
top story today,

1567
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:33,220
come into us from a CNBC here.
Um,

1568
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:34,200
I'm sure,
uh,

1569
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:39,290
a lot of people heard about this 
facebook at work pc,

1570
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:41,683
or is it hd?
Mine?

1571
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:43,320
Itchy my too.
Yeah,

1572
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:44,183
yeah,
yeah,

1573
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,053
yeah,
yeah.

1574
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,690
Hello.
It's fucking,

1575
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:51,110
oh my God.
There you go.

1576
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,700
All right.
Hey.

1577
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,681
All right.
So,

1578
01:18:54,681 --> 01:18:55,191
uh,
yeah,

1579
01:18:55,191 --> 01:18:56,024
top store.
We got a facebook loses $100 billion 

1580
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:03,470
plus in market cap.

1581
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:05,890
Wow.
This past week,

1582
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:08,710
uh,
their shares plunged a on Thursday,

1583
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,600
uh,
or I guess it was Wednesday after hours,

1584
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:11,920
uh,
by 20%,

1585
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,293
um,
which it was in response to them 

1586
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:16,203
announcing that they're,
they're going to up their spending on 

1587
01:19:18,551 --> 01:19:21,520
privacy concerns and fighting fake news 
on the platform.

1588
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,170
People were like,
fuck that.

1589
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,530
I want that rush of money rights.
Um,

1590
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:27,510
and I,
I guess it,

1591
01:19:27,511 --> 01:19:28,344
it,
it basically is more so about they're 

1592
01:19:29,381 --> 01:19:32,020
going to be spending a ton of money to 
do this.

1593
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,093
Um,
and that kind of coupled with the fact 

1594
01:19:34,901 --> 01:19:37,240
that I guess their user growth has 
really slowed down.

1595
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:38,200
Surprise,
surprise.

1596
01:19:38,201 --> 01:19:41,410
Facebook fucking sucks.
Nobody wants to sign up anymore.

1597
01:19:41,411 --> 01:19:43,960
And so it's just kind of created this 
perfect storm where,

1598
01:19:43,961 --> 01:19:45,880
yeah,
in a single night,

1599
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:49,990
$100 billion disappeared off the market.
Single biggest loss for a company.

1600
01:19:49,991 --> 01:19:51,240
Right?
The single biggest loss.

1601
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:52,130
However,
um,

1602
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:54,790
and just to give some perspective number
two,

1603
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,713
uh,
I looked this up on September 22nd the 

1604
01:19:58,931 --> 01:20:03,750
year 2000 Intel lost 90 billion,
so about 18 years ago.

1605
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,890
And that was,
you know,

1606
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,550
the.com
crash.

1607
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:08,550
That happened at the end of the 
nineties.

1608
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:09,770
Well,
sort of results.

1609
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:13,620
What I'd like to say is suck my Dick 
facebook.

1610
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,900
Fuck you,
mark Zuckerberg.

1611
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,370
Fuck you.
Facebook.

1612
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,610
I cannot wait for facebook to become the
next my space.

1613
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,110
I'm very,
I've said this all the time,

1614
01:20:22,111 --> 01:20:25,560
but I hate everything about facebook and
I'm so fucking glad.

1615
01:20:25,561 --> 01:20:26,394
By the way I read a report,
they're like their earnings from them 

1616
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:30,900
stealing content from where everywhere 
else on the internet,

1617
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:33,510
like the earnings aren't good and the 
engagement isn't good.

1618
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:37,350
And all I have to say is for those 
reasons I'm out.

1619
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:39,180
Fuck you,
facebook.

1620
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:44,010
I am so glad to see that website die.
Well,

1621
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:49,430
maybe don't get too excited yet because 
apparently they were up 20% this year,

1622
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:57,370
so they're basically just back to where 
they were a few months ago.

1623
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,021
Well,
let's see it.

1624
01:20:58,021 --> 01:20:59,580
Let's,
let's wash his baby slide.

1625
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:00,690
Yeah,
we'll see what happens.

1626
01:21:00,691 --> 01:21:01,830
What else you got in the news,
Dan?

1627
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:02,723
All right,
so next up,

1628
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:04,440
um,
uh,

1629
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:06,600
Papa John.
Oh No,

1630
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,240
Papa John.
Um,

1631
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,250
we talked about this a couple of weeks 
ago or last week and not,

1632
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:14,400
not having a great month.
I'm having a great July.

1633
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,350
Um,
Papa John,

1634
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:20,490
the man is now suing Papa John the 
company.

1635
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:21,511
Um,
no,

1636
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:22,344
he's going after him.
John Shatner civil war and it's the 

1637
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:26,520
civil war.
It's the pizza wars and I'm,

1638
01:21:26,521 --> 01:21:28,050
no,
the pizza wars are upon us.

1639
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,900
When Papa John Fights Papa John,
you know who wins?

1640
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,970
Nobody.
Little seizures.

1641
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:34,410
Oh yeah,
you're right.

1642
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:36,240
You're right.
Oh,

1643
01:21:36,241 --> 01:21:38,990
I love this description.
Shatner has admitted to,

1644
01:21:38,991 --> 01:21:39,824
as he said,
the n word on a conference call with a 

1645
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:43,770
marketing firm.
Shatner claimed the firm asked if he was

1646
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:45,040
racist.
Listen,

1647
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:45,883
are you racist then use the n word 
inscribing house KFC is Colonel Sanders 

1648
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:51,114
used to talk chat and has since also 
said that he told the firm that he 

1649
01:21:54,811 --> 01:21:59,811
himself wouldn't ever use that word 
after having used the word right.

1650
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,713
Which is kind of the confusing part of 
this whole thing is he's like 

1651
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,213
acknowledging that he said it,
but also denying that he said it in the 

1652
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:08,940
Sweden.
I've always,

1653
01:22:08,941 --> 01:22:11,400
when I,
when I saw that headline and then I read

1654
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:12,570
the article,
I was like,

1655
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:15,120
well again,
I do think there needs to be a disc.

1656
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:16,493
Like I haven't,
we all fucking kind of lost our minds a 

1657
01:22:18,961 --> 01:22:20,280
little bit.
I mean,

1658
01:22:20,281 --> 01:22:23,100
he shouldn't have said it.
That's for sure.

1659
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,410
If a marketing company asks,
are you racist?

1660
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:28,890
Don't drop the n bomb this show how not 
racist you are.

1661
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:33,960
Which is basically what he did.
But like he didn't like use the,

1662
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:34,853
he didn't weaponize the word,
he didn't use the word he was talking 

1663
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:37,740
about the word.
Right.

1664
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:39,650
You know what I mean?
Like the headlines Bra,

1665
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:44,010
the drug drops to Ed on the conference 
call and you're like,

1666
01:22:44,011 --> 01:22:44,844
whoa.
Like he just like called someone the n 

1667
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:49,650
word or somewhat not exactly what 
happened,

1668
01:22:49,651 --> 01:22:50,580
but I mean,
you know,

1669
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:52,800
Papa John,
he's sliding that guy spent,

1670
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:55,620
he spent way too much time close to a 
pizza oven.

1671
01:22:56,410 --> 01:23:00,060
His face is like melting off like that 
Mozzarella cheese is like,

1672
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,500
it's in the pores and men that pizza is 
ready to,

1673
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:05,890
you can't that pizza

1674
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:09,760
that peet's has been baked too may time.
So,

1675
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:11,260
yeah,
so he's going after them,

1676
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:11,951
uh,
saying that,

1677
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:14,800
you know,
he was unfairly forced out as the,

1678
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:16,930
uh,
head and I guess he's,

1679
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:18,093
I thought he was out completely.
I guess it was just that he was forced 

1680
01:23:20,381 --> 01:23:21,214
out as the chairman.
He still owns 29% of the company while 

1681
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:27,180
he was on the board of directors and 
then they booted him.

1682
01:23:27,181 --> 01:23:28,300
Right.
And so he,

1683
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:32,110
he's still got his,
his claws in it a little bit.

1684
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:33,010
Um,
but they're,

1685
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,520
they're trying real hard to get rid of 
him.

1686
01:23:34,521 --> 01:23:38,980
I love his papa John who is the man.
You mean pop a boner

1687
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:42,990
and usurp power.
You've got that meme.

1688
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,110
I saw this man,
man.

1689
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:45,720
I really think the y'all,
yeah,

1690
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:49,680
this kind of says it all.
You can't trust anybody.

1691
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:50,993
Even yourself.
What happens when Papa John Tries to 

1692
01:23:54,961 --> 01:23:59,520
execute?
Papa John's thought provoking.

1693
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:01,843
Really.
It Dan,

1694
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,390
what's next?
Some deep stuff.

1695
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:03,990
All right.
Uh,

1696
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:04,940
let's see.
What is next.

1697
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,450
Oh,
this is really cool.

1698
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:09,670
Um,
so this week a,

1699
01:24:09,671 --> 01:24:10,504
a team of Italian researchers announced 
that after analyzing some data for the 

1700
01:24:14,521 --> 01:24:15,354
last two years,
they are saying with a high degree of 

1701
01:24:18,031 --> 01:24:23,031
confidence that they have discovered a 
lake of water on Mars.

1702
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:27,420
Um,
it is under the southern polar cap.

1703
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,900
And I guess this is very similar.
Um,

1704
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,790
the reason they knew to look for this 
specific thing is,

1705
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:36,220
um,
there's these kinds of lakes in an class

1706
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:40,050
here on earth in a very similar fashion.
And so they were using,

1707
01:24:40,051 --> 01:24:40,884
there's this European,
a space mission called the Mars Express 

1708
01:24:43,321 --> 01:24:44,154
orbiter that was able to use ground 
penetrating radar and they detected a 

1709
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:50,370
what looked like a lake,
but they weren't sure.

1710
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:52,410
Um,
but again,

1711
01:24:52,411 --> 01:24:54,450
after a analyzing this for the last two 
years,

1712
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:55,343
they with a high degree of confidence 
are able to say this is a wow 20 

1713
01:24:59,281 --> 01:25:02,130
kilometer wide lake sitting,
uh,

1714
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:06,120
an amateur and a half under the ice cap.
Any estimate when we can get anything up

1715
01:25:06,121 --> 01:25:07,640
there to do some digging?
Yeah.

1716
01:25:07,641 --> 01:25:09,090
So I mean that's the problem.
It's,

1717
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,740
it's,
that's still a ways off,

1718
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:11,613
uh,
just because of the weight of all the 

1719
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:13,800
equipment you would need.
I mean,

1720
01:25:13,801 --> 01:25:16,560
you need a drill that can go almost a 
mile straight,

1721
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:18,753
thrilling when we can cut into that ice.
Like if they find like there's two 

1722
01:25:24,271 --> 01:25:26,100
options or there's three options,
really.

1723
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:31,140
One option is that they find life that 
is identical and DNA to ours,

1724
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,020
which could mean that life originated on
Mars.

1725
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:34,883
Right.
And then like a meteor impact or 

1726
01:25:36,961 --> 01:25:37,794
something she sperm did onto earth.
And then the second option is that it's 

1727
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,700
different.
Completely different.

1728
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:47,160
The third options,
there's nothing there.

1729
01:25:47,161 --> 01:25:49,980
They're all fascinating and their own 
right.

1730
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:55,280
The craziest one for me would be like,
if it's completely a different origin of

1731
01:25:55,681 --> 01:25:57,000
life,
sure.

1732
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,953
But if you do find life,
I feel like the most likely would be 

1733
01:25:59,461 --> 01:26:01,620
that it's the same Dna,
I feel like.

1734
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:02,540
Yeah.

1735
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:03,373
And I think you're though that if it 
were completely different from life on 

1736
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:06,794
earth,
that that won't be the coolest thing 

1737
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:09,260
because that just shows.
Okay.

1738
01:26:09,261 --> 01:26:13,040
So it developed completely independently
on two planets in the solar system.

1739
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:17,270
That means it's everywhere.
How much you'd like to see.

1740
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:18,104
Another alien life form that has a 
completely different building blocks 

1741
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:24,440
would be late discovery of,
of the life.

1742
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,060
I can,
I cannot wait for that.

1743
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:29,120
That's so cool.
God bless.

1744
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,340
Really awesome.
Really awesome stuff.

1745
01:26:31,341 --> 01:26:32,600
So good job.
Good job.

1746
01:26:32,601 --> 01:26:35,330
Italy.
[inaudible] killing it over there.

1747
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:37,670
Uh,
next up.

1748
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:40,460
Uh,
so I don't know if everybody,

1749
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:44,510
I'm sure everybody's heard about this.
So James Gunn got fired from,

1750
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:46,820
uh,
the guardians of the galaxy three.

1751
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,200
Um,
because,

1752
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,200
uh,
some old tweets got dug up from about 10

1753
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:55,850
years ago of him making some pretty,
pretty distasteful.

1754
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,193
What was,
what was the joke you have if you have 

1755
01:26:59,361 --> 01:26:59,870
an example?

1756
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:01,800
So I have one example.
Uh,

1757
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,480
and in the words of the article,
this is from entertainment weekly.

1758
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:06,980
Uh,
this was one of the only ones that could

1759
01:27:06,981 --> 01:27:07,814
reprint.
So I can only imagine the rest were 

1760
01:27:09,051 --> 01:27:10,160
pretty bad too.
This one,

1761
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:12,260
uh,
was laughter is the best medicine.

1762
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:14,930
That's why I laugh at people with AIDS.
Oh,

1763
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:16,760
fucking cares.
That's not that.

1764
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:18,830
You know,
seriously.

1765
01:27:18,831 --> 01:27:19,664
Yeah.
Yep.

1766
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,833
Now they did say this again.
This is potentially one of the least 

1767
01:27:25,190 --> 01:27:26,670
find,
find the worst one.

1768
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:29,170
They've all been,
they've all been scrubbed at this.

1769
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:30,220
Come on.
They're out there on that.

1770
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,000
I'm sure they're out there.
They're out there.

1771
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:33,770
Um,
and fine.

1772
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:35,563
Let's,
let's see.

1773
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:37,310
You know,
that's not bad.

1774
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:38,361
Let's see what's,
yeah,

1775
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:38,901
I mean,
that's,

1776
01:27:38,901 --> 01:27:41,080
that's not the worst,
but here's the whole,

1777
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:43,190
you know,
you're looking in switching the,

1778
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:44,120
uh,
the computer.

1779
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,310
Fuck,
he's in the hot seat right here though.

1780
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:48,830
You can find them.
I'm googling it was on it.

1781
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:50,270
Okay.
Um,

1782
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:54,470
so basically what this all is,
is,

1783
01:27:54,471 --> 01:27:55,100
uh,
you know,

1784
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:55,933
James Gunn,
he's pretty outspoken critic of trump 

1785
01:27:58,610 --> 01:27:59,560
and,
um,

1786
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:04,280
some this right wing group that didn't 
like that he was talking all this shit,

1787
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:05,203
uh,
decided to kind of troll through all of 

1788
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:08,690
his old tweets and everything.
And yeah,

1789
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:09,524
I mean,
I guess James Gunn has been on twitter 

1790
01:28:10,011 --> 01:28:12,560
forever,
and so there was thousands and thousands

1791
01:28:12,561 --> 01:28:13,394
of these things and James Gunn,
if anybody knows anything about James 

1792
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:17,240
Gunn,
he,

1793
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,940
he,
he's an edgy dude like that.

1794
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,073
Everything before doing the guardians of
the galaxy movies that he's ever done 

1795
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:27,590
was pretty Raunchy.
What's the,

1796
01:28:27,591 --> 01:28:30,170
uh,
what's the headline?

1797
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:32,870
So the headline is there's a campaign to
get him,

1798
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:33,753
um,
to get him rehired that it was bullshit 

1799
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:36,940
that they fired him.
And,

1800
01:28:36,941 --> 01:28:39,060
and you know the fans,
they,

1801
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:40,580
they love the guardians movies.

1802
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:41,443
They think he's done a good job.
They don't care and they want them back 

1803
01:28:43,611 --> 01:28:44,300
end.
Um,

1804
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,520
as of yesterday,
300,000

1805
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:49,010
signatures in a matter of,
I think two or three days.

1806
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:50,910
So Disney's,
that's like,

1807
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:52,370
you have found a,
Oh yeah,

1808
01:28:52,371 --> 01:28:53,270
let's hear it.
Give me more.

1809
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:56,450
Give me the most cause that,
that wouldn't have got him fired.

1810
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:57,343
All right,
so here's an I like when little boys 

1811
01:28:58,391 --> 01:29:02,910
touch me in my silly place.
Another thing that's pretty cringy.

1812
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:04,230
I mean,
that's the thing.

1813
01:29:04,231 --> 01:29:08,010
None of these are even really that sexy.
It's really not funny at all.

1814
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:11,700
The best thing about being raped is when
you're done being raped and it's like,

1815
01:29:11,701 --> 01:29:13,410
whew,
this feels great not being raped.

1816
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:15,300
God,
can you imagine tweeting that?

1817
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:17,880
It's like so embarrassing.
Well,

1818
01:29:17,881 --> 01:29:18,920
and he's embarrassed.
I mean,

1819
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:20,790
he said like,
I was an idiot.

1820
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:22,230
I was just trying to be edgy.

1821
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:24,810
I'm not this person anymore.
10 years.

1822
01:29:24,811 --> 01:29:25,644
Think back 10 years ago,
how much like of a person you can 

1823
01:29:27,211 --> 01:29:28,200
change.
I mean,

1824
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:29,034
the weird thing is like Disney hired 
this guy who has a reputation and now 

1825
01:29:34,861 --> 01:29:37,530
all the sudden they're shocked what 
James Gunn,

1826
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:40,620
this whole thing of firing someone for a
tweet they may 10 years ago.

1827
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:42,130
So obscene.
And I,

1828
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:44,160
and I think Disney now,
it's probably like,

1829
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,310
maybe we were,
I don't know if they're regretting it,

1830
01:29:47,311 --> 01:29:51,960
but I don't think,
I don't think a trillion signatures will

1831
01:29:51,961 --> 01:29:55,860
ever make Disney eat attack.
They'll never change their mind.

1832
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:57,360
No.
And that's,

1833
01:29:57,870 --> 01:29:59,390
I doubt it too.
Um,

1834
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:02,250
even if they got triple those,
what else?

1835
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:04,370
Do you have any other tweets?
I actually enjoy,

1836
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,510
there's a bunch of your,
what he says.

1837
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:07,480
So,
um,

1838
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:08,633
oh,
there's a maid's typical comments about 

1839
01:30:09,841 --> 01:30:12,270
nine 11.
It's a holocaust.

1840
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:13,183
Um,
just grabbed a monkey masturbating on a 

1841
01:30:14,671 --> 01:30:19,020
young child and it was called Terry that
made him extremely happy.

1842
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,393
Uh,
it looks like those were the only ones 

1843
01:30:23,671 --> 01:30:24,504
that they tweeted.
And then we'll just given kind of some 

1844
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:27,630
more examples of the type of thing.
But again,

1845
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:28,653
that's,
that's what's great.

1846
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:31,710
Disney will not rehire him because you 
know,

1847
01:30:31,711 --> 01:30:33,490
this is Disney and they haven't been 
clean,

1848
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:37,860
but why did they hire him in the first 
place then everybody like,

1849
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,233
did they not know who he was?
Companies are such fucking policies 

1850
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:43,260
these days.
Like,

1851
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,890
like the minute they sniff controversy.
Yeah.

1852
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,470
It's like everybody shut the fucking 
door.

1853
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,333
You know what I mean?

1854
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:54,100
You know what I'm saying?
Listen,

1855
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:59,880
this goes out to every company out there
to stick it about firing someone because

1856
01:30:59,881 --> 01:31:04,881
they did something offensive.
I mean,

1857
01:31:05,881 --> 01:31:06,714
come on.

1858
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:12,020
Technically the same company,
she got fired by ABC,

1859
01:31:12,021 --> 01:31:14,260
which is Disney.
Disney owns everything.

1860
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:15,343
Disney.
Disney owns like the butt plug that you 

1861
01:31:18,111 --> 01:31:21,470
see and they have a butt plug brand.
Do they?

1862
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:22,700
Yeah.
They own everything.

1863
01:31:22,701 --> 01:31:23,534
I don't know why you said Bob Plug,
but like they own Disney owns 

1864
01:31:26,211 --> 01:31:27,980
everything.
Didn't they just buy out a huge company?

1865
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,990
Well,
they're buying Fox.

1866
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:32,960
They're trying to and it looks like it's
happening.

1867
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:34,760
There was a little bit of a back and 
forth.

1868
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:37,040
They were in a bidding war,
but there they're going to win his,

1869
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:38,800
they're plucking Disney.
Disney.

1870
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:42,830
When they own every company in America,
that's when,

1871
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:44,023
that's when fascism will be here.
Cause you're not gonna be able to make 

1872
01:31:45,921 --> 01:31:47,160
any jokes at all.
And then you,

1873
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,640
you,
you work in a factory.

1874
01:31:49,790 --> 01:31:53,900
All of a sudden they own like 
fulfillment factories and you can't joke

1875
01:31:53,901 --> 01:31:55,700
about the holocaust anymore suddenly.

1876
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:57,110
Oh,
6 million,

1877
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:01,390
shut it down.
You know what I'm saying?

1878
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,180
Yeah,
I do.

1879
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:05,014
For the record,
think those numbers are accurate or 

1880
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:09,374
you're not a holocaust.
But I will say that nine 11 is highly 

1881
01:32:11,261 --> 01:32:13,450
suspicious.
And let me tell you,

1882
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:15,880
there's nothing I love more than 
monkeys.

1883
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:16,714
Jerk.
That one's a weird one that he would 

1884
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:21,040
tweet out.
I like monkeys jerking on kids.

1885
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:24,520
That's how fucking weird image dog that 
I don't mind.

1886
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:27,140
Let's move on.
All right.

1887
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,920
It's the next,
uh,

1888
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:32,290
next step.
This is a article from enemy.

1889
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:34,750
I thought this was interesting.
Their enemy.

1890
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:36,160
Uh,
it's a British,

1891
01:32:36,161 --> 01:32:38,050
um,
entertainment magazine.

1892
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,293
Uh,
there are seven Robin Hood movies being 

1893
01:32:43,531 --> 01:32:44,800
made.
Robin Hood Movie.

1894
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:45,671
Well,
no,

1895
01:32:45,671 --> 01:32:47,530
that already got made.
That's the,

1896
01:32:47,531 --> 01:32:48,280
uh,
yeah.

1897
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:49,660
Ridley Scott,
I believe.

1898
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:50,680
Oh,
is that a good movie?

1899
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:51,880
No.
Okay.

1900
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:53,680
That's probably why you haven't heard of
it.

1901
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:55,000
It's not good at all.
That's a shame.

1902
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,490
So that's an older one.
Um,

1903
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:57,783
but yeah,
they are a in this era of reboots and 

1904
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:03,790
relaunches and restarts and all the 
reasons you said seven,

1905
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:04,653
seven,
did they not get the memo that like 

1906
01:33:06,851 --> 01:33:09,490
everyone else was making it?
Robin had movie.

1907
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,750
Yeah,
that's a good question.

1908
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:13,420
I mean they all have kind of their own 
take on it to be fair.

1909
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,593
Um,
but does anybody even give a shit about 

1910
01:33:15,941 --> 01:33:17,890
Robin Hood?
Like I like Robin Hood.

1911
01:33:18,310 --> 01:33:19,270
Excuse me,
Dan.

1912
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:20,480
Okay.
I like Robin Hood.

1913
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,150
You're the target audience.
Well guess what?

1914
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:26,860
You're going to be thrilled to hear.
You want to be busy this fall.

1915
01:33:26,861 --> 01:33:28,510
So just to quickly just rattled them 
off.

1916
01:33:28,511 --> 01:33:32,650
We've got a movie called uh,
Robin Hood origins,

1917
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,600
uh,
or it was called Robin Hood origins.

1918
01:33:34,601 --> 01:33:36,520
It's since been robin.
Dan,

1919
01:33:36,521 --> 01:33:37,990
I'm going to stop you.
I don't need seven.

1920
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,160
Robin had titles.
Okay.

1921
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:40,223
All right.
Fair enough.

1922
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:42,040
Look them up yourself,
everybody,

1923
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:43,300
if you're,
if you're curious.

1924
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:46,480
I sense I sense this.
Yeah,

1925
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:48,280
that's a lot of Robin Hood.
It's a lot of Robin Hood.

1926
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:49,920
To be fair.
There's a lot of rabbinic.

1927
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:51,760
All right,
next story.

1928
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:54,130
Um,
this is actually like two weeks ago.

1929
01:33:54,131 --> 01:33:55,160
This is too good.
I mean,

1930
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,200
we had to,
uh,

1931
01:33:56,710 --> 01:33:58,440
had to do it to them,
had to do it to him.

1932
01:33:59,390 --> 01:34:04,030
There was a flight in China that loss 
pressure and dropped 20,000

1933
01:34:04,031 --> 01:34:05,540
feet.
Um,

1934
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,740
because the pilots were vaping in the 
cockpit.

1935
01:34:08,770 --> 01:34:10,680
How does that happen?
What's the correlation?

1936
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:15,820
So they were vaping and it got so full 
or hotboxing the,

1937
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:17,800
they were hot boxing the cockpit.
Wow.

1938
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:18,693
Yes.
And,

1939
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:22,390
and it got,
and basically they didn't want the vapor

1940
01:34:22,391 --> 01:34:23,224
to escape into the passenger cabin,
give away the fact that they were doing 

1941
01:34:26,441 --> 01:34:27,210
this.
So,

1942
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:28,043
uh,
the copilot tried to flip a switch that 

1943
01:34:30,071 --> 01:34:33,430
would keep the air from cycling into the
rest of the cabin,

1944
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,200
uh,
and hit the wrong button,

1945
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,160
which depressurized the cabinet.

1946
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,330
Why is there a button to depressurize 
the cabin?

1947
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:43,300
Midflight anyway,
that seems like a little danger.

1948
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:44,143
That's a good question.
I mean maybe there's some preventative 

1949
01:34:46,001 --> 01:34:47,950
thing that they need to do that 
occasionally for,

1950
01:34:47,951 --> 01:34:49,210
but um,
but yeah,

1951
01:34:49,211 --> 01:34:51,640
I guess it was right next to the other 
switch and it was so,

1952
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:55,540
so much fucking Dank vape smoke in there
that they,

1953
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:56,374
uh,
hit the wrong button and just had to 

1954
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:02,240
kind of barrel down all the oxygen mask 
drops and uh,

1955
01:35:02,241 --> 01:35:05,030
yeah,
so maybe nation,

1956
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:05,864
the air over in China,
are they executed when they land in 

1957
01:35:08,181 --> 01:35:09,530
China?
I mean,

1958
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:11,690
uh,
it is China.

1959
01:35:11,691 --> 01:35:13,130
So let's just say that.
Um,

1960
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:17,780
nobody's heard from these vape natures.
I hope wherever you are,

1961
01:35:17,781 --> 01:35:20,300
you're vaping in heaven now,
but everyone's okay.

1962
01:35:20,301 --> 01:35:23,450
God blessed Hallelujah injuries.
Uh,

1963
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:24,520
our last,
uh,

1964
01:35:24,521 --> 01:35:26,690
this is actually the last story here.
Um,

1965
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,353
a Colombian,
a drug dog has been moved into witness 

1966
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:32,324
protection for lack of a better term,
after a gang in Columbia put a hit on 

1967
01:35:38,241 --> 01:35:39,074
this dog.

1968
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:41,360
The dog named Sombra,
uh,

1969
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:42,194
which means shadow in English,
which snipped out a record amount of 

1970
01:35:44,721 --> 01:35:46,740
drugs in her career,
um,

1971
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:50,630
has been forced to be moved to ensure 
her safety is,

1972
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:52,540
she's this dog has smoked,
smoked out,

1973
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:53,423
sniffed out 5.3
tons of cocaine to that though was 

1974
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:57,830
fucking awesome.
Yup.

1975
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,033
There,
although it says here the hit is only 

1976
01:36:00,081 --> 01:36:01,760
70,000.
They're going to I think,

1977
01:36:01,761 --> 01:36:03,500
feel like,
yeah.

1978
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:04,460
Which is a,
by the way,

1979
01:36:04,461 --> 01:36:08,030
200 million a Colombian pesos.
Yeah,

1980
01:36:08,031 --> 01:36:08,864
but you were just calling it costs like 
a million pesos for like a loaf of 

1981
01:36:10,941 --> 01:36:11,481
bread.
Well,

1982
01:36:11,481 --> 01:36:12,314
yeah.
And just to put it into some 

1983
01:36:12,951 --> 01:36:15,170
perspective,
in 2012,

1984
01:36:15,171 --> 01:36:16,004
there was a whole incident where the 
gang had put down a hits on police 

1985
01:36:18,951 --> 01:36:23,240
officer's offering $500.
Whoa.

1986
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:25,340
So,
so by comparison,

1987
01:36:25,341 --> 01:36:28,270
this dog is the dog.
The dog,

1988
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:31,730
Columbia are murdering people for five 
police for $500.

1989
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:32,593
Well,
uh,

1990
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:33,843
the article about it says that they 
found leaflets signed by the gang 

1991
01:36:36,530 --> 01:36:37,363
offering $500.
I don't know if anybody actually took 

1992
01:36:38,811 --> 01:36:40,430
them up.
Broke ass gang.

1993
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:46,400
500 broke because of this dog fucking 
busting all their coke,

1994
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:49,280
so that's sad is how that's,
come on guys.

1995
01:36:49,281 --> 01:36:51,380
It's a fucking dog.
He can kill people.

1996
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:56,150
You can kill helpless civilians,
but spare the dog.

1997
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,740
The dog's out of it people.
Come on.

1998
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:00,260
All right,
so there is this,

1999
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:03,320
this is sombra little hero right here.
I hope I pray for him.

2000
01:37:04,810 --> 01:37:05,870
So that's it.
That's it.

2001
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:08,990
That's the news.
That's the hard right there guys.

2002
01:37:08,991 --> 01:37:10,720
That's everything that's out there.
Yup.

2003
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:11,803
Oh No.
There's a couple of things I want to do 

2004
01:37:12,921 --> 01:37:14,900
first before we go out.
First of all,

2005
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:17,540
why the fuck did I want to bring Ian 
Out?

2006
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:20,310
I don't remember.
Oh,

2007
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,393
oh God.
I wanted to make and smell the belly 

2008
01:37:23,931 --> 01:37:24,764
button lint.

2009
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,770
I feel like I missed the train though,
but it is Dan's birthday recently and we

2010
01:37:30,771 --> 01:37:34,340
want it to honor Dan for his birthday.
Damn.

2011
01:37:34,341 --> 01:37:35,960
Would you come join us here for a 
minute?

2012
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:36,823
All right,
hold on.

2013
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:42,470
I wish I could bring in out too,
but we don't have enough people here and

2014
01:37:42,471 --> 01:37:44,450
I'm going to make,
I want to make you sniff this.

2015
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:46,243
It's a,
it's a rite of passage that everyone in 

2016
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:50,420
this crew needs to abide by.
So Dan,

2017
01:37:50,421 --> 01:37:51,254
it is your birthday.
You do mean a lot to us here at the 

2018
01:37:53,361 --> 01:37:54,580
[inaudible] podcast.
Thank you.

2019
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:56,200
We want to,
uh,

2020
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:59,500
we really want to honor honor that,
that a day.

2021
01:37:59,730 --> 01:38:00,840
Well,

2022
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,920

Enjoy.

01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:12,420
Let's see what we got

2031
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:17,953

2032
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:20,493
Yeah,

2033
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,230
go ahead.
Today you are a bar Mitzvah.

2034
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:27,800
Hold this up so we can see this last 
part here.

2035
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:29,720
You're also handsome,

2036
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:31,100
good natured.
Oh,

2037
01:38:31,101 --> 01:38:31,934

Oh,

2038
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:33,920
we're going on a journey.
Yes sir.

2039
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:36,323
Okay.

2040
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:39,210
Kind,
smart and caring.

2041
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:42,720
Yup.
You're a mench and a blessing in so many

2042
01:38:42,721 --> 01:38:47,721
ways.
What more could any family asked for us?

2043
01:38:48,361 --> 01:38:51,940
So proud of you?
Dan would leave.

2044
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:52,833
What did you get?
Mazal Tov and lots of love and a gift 

2045
01:38:56,371 --> 01:38:57,930
card.
The hot topic.

2046
01:38:57,931 --> 01:38:59,760
Everybody.
How much for all these shit?

2047
01:38:59,761 --> 01:39:02,010
15 bucks.
The bare minimum.

2048
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:02,913
That's any amount between 15 and 500.
I want you to spend that and I want to 

2049
01:39:05,911 --> 01:39:08,370
know what you buy.
There are still hot topics.

2050
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,233
Yeah,
they're out there actually that we did 

2051
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:11,303
it.
We listen,

2052
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:13,860
we are very generous.
Heard the HD podcasts.

2053
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:15,690
We did get you this.
Oh,

2054
01:39:15,691 --> 01:39:18,360
it is a constellation.
But the real gift is the hot topic.

2055
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:20,910
I appreciate that.
Now this is kind of garbage honestly.

2056
01:39:20,911 --> 01:39:22,710
Yeah.
Throw that out all about the hot topic.

2057
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:23,753
But um,
I do want you to go to hot topic and 

2058
01:39:25,261 --> 01:39:28,050
report back on what you were able to buy
for 15 or 15 bucks.

2059
01:39:28,051 --> 01:39:28,950
No,
it's going to happen.

2060
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:29,903
You're going to end up going there and 
spending because you can't buy anything 

2061
01:39:31,801 --> 01:39:34,140
for 15 bucks.
Kind of cursing.

2062
01:39:34,141 --> 01:39:35,820
You,
cursing me to,

2063
01:39:35,821 --> 01:39:36,780
uh,
you're going to,

2064
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:38,410
next time you see me,
I'm going to have um,

2065
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:40,320
a bunch of,
uh,

2066
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,800
invader Zim shirts.
I love it.

2067
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:44,040
Uh,
um,

2068
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:46,200
congratulations.

2069
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,510
Come here.

2070
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:52,730
You guys switched really fast.
All right.

2071
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,890
Happy Birthday Dude.
We're doing that.

2072
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:57,050
But I did give him a real gift you guys 
into that,

2073
01:39:57,051 --> 01:39:58,640
but whatever.

2074
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:01,850
Oh God.
Oh,

2075
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:02,783
what a slip that Ian come in here.
And finally guys to close out the show 

2076
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:08,593
next week.
Remember Tuesday Isla returns episode 

2077
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:16,480
Thursday Dunky and Leah episode.
We've got a lot on deck in.

2078
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:19,040
This is a big moment for you to talk 
about a bar Mitzvah.

2079
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:22,250
This is when you become a man.
This is when you become initiated.

2080
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:25,430
And two are little clan here,
right?

2081
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:26,900
So in,
are you ready to give,

2082
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:30,590
this is skippy's belly button lint 
collection.

2083
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:35,300
Stay awake during the meeting pills.
What the fuck has he been eating?

2084
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:40,130
I was looking at that too.
It's one to two for regular meetings.

2085
01:40:40,131 --> 01:40:41,990
Two to four,
four ward conferences.

2086
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:46,760
Eight to 10 for dry high council night.
The fuck are they feeding him?

2087
01:40:46,761 --> 01:40:48,380
What the fuck?
This is like Mormon medicine.

2088
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:53,410
I think it's candy cause uh,
it says one 79 cents.

2089
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:57,670
Well that's a little strange.
I have to say regardless,

2090
01:40:57,671 --> 01:41:00,640
he in go ahead and have to,
I really,

2091
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:01,653
I don't know.
You don't have to do anything you don't 

2092
01:41:02,441 --> 01:41:06,530
want to again,
but now I kind of weirdly want to,

2093
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,330
cause you want to be one of us.
I guess.

2094
01:41:10,490 --> 01:41:11,650
Yeah,
I guess I'll do it.

2095
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:13,270
I guess I'll smell it.
Okay.

2096
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:14,200
Give it a strong with,

2097
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:17,003
okay.

2098
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:20,440
Wow.
That was a strong one.

2099
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:23,140
It's got a hokey describe.
Okay.

2100
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:28,260
Okay.
Maybe I'm detecting pomegranate,

2101
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:30,460
right?
I don't know.

2102
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:34,630
It smells like an old mattress,
like a really old man,

2103
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:35,493
like,
like you as you're walking down the 

2104
01:41:38,021 --> 01:41:41,800
street and they see that and you see it,
see it on the side of the road.

2105
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:45,730
To me it's so much worse than that.
Like there's such a must.

2106
01:41:45,731 --> 01:41:48,610
It's on the leave of worse than a street
mattress,

2107
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:49,603
bro.
It's like a,

2108
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:51,670
it's like a street mattress.
Black Hole.

2109
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:55,930
Like there was consolidated until like a
marble of its smell.

2110
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,400
You know what I mean?
They like compressed.

2111
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:00,020
There's like little pubic hairs in it.
Oh,

2112
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:02,560
that's great.
Well,

2113
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,633
I'll tell you what,
we're going to wrap this and fucking 

2114
01:42:04,601 --> 01:42:07,300
blaze it someday and I want you to be 
the first one to hit it.

2115
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,460
I don't,
and I was thinking

2116
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:12,760
maybe it's a regenerative thing.
Maybe it's got power.

Like,

Do you want to eat something?

01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:16,990
I don't want to eat it out.
