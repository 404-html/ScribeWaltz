00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,040
Welcome everybody to the h,
three podcast,

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,160
soundboard experience.
Little late on the uptake there guys,

3
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,180
but better,
you know,

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,230
pretty close.
Thank you to today's sponsors,

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,260
postmates dollar shave club,
that really.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,710
And a forehand coming up and the month 
ahead.

7
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:29,994
We've got Jack Septic eye,
the sweetest man on youtube coming up 

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,720
next week.
Bert Kreischer.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,670
We've been waiting and waiting to get 
burke crusher in here.

10
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,950
Super Funny Comedian.
Love Him.

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,623
Great.
He was actually one of our first 

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,563
earliest guests we've had on here.
It was such a funny episode last into 

13
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,680
oblivion.
And uh,

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,520
he just,
he deserves better than that.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,550
You know,
I felt bad about that,

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,743
but we're going to do good the second.
This one's not going to be as good as 

17
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:06,924
that one.
Nothing will ever top that tenacious d 

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,860
song,
the greatest song in the world.

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,650
You know that song.
It's like that.

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,710
Nothing will ever be as great as the 
greatest thing in the world,

21
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:17,820
but this is attributed to it.

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,930
And then after that we've got tim.
Hi Decker.

23
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,930
Aye.
Aye.

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,860
That's exciting.
And then after that,

25
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:27,120
yet again,
later in the month,

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,350
Adam Carolla all sealed in great,
wonderful guests.

27
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,420
Huge month ahead.
Very excited.

28
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:36,060
Thank you.
And before we get into it,

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
you guys have seen us rocking.
Grateful dead merchant.

30
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,493
I love grateful dead.
I love their merchant as much as I love 

31
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,230
their music.
Well guess what?

32
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,950
We got her own grateful dead inspired 
merge.

33
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:47,784
Say whoa.
You can't really feel that she gets 

34
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,000
naked air for a sec.
Look at this.

35
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,350
Oh my God.
So sick introductory productions.

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,240
You've got shredder.
You got both of us.

37
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,880
I mean it's sick.
Tie Dye,

38
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,370
soda represent.com/h
the extra take extra thick hat.

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,410
Where are you at?

40
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,270
Represent the shirt is sick.
I haven't been aware.

41
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,240
This shirt.
Straight up.

42
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,313
Shane Dawson style.
I'm going to wear this everywhere 

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,860
because I love it that much.
Um,

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,900
that's about it.
I've got a question.

45
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:31,734
So what did you say the link though?
Because it's represent dotcom slash h 

46
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:36,660
three h three.
You got it on the screen.

47
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,750
This is what all the sponsors make you.
Do they go r,

48
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,870
r e p r e s e n t.com?
Yeah.

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,610
I don't know.
Yeah.

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,640
I don't know how to spell represent that
gob slash street twice.

51
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,383
Whatever,
whatever.

52
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,230
Just look what's on the screen.
I don't know what I'm doing.

53
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,950
Um,
let me ask you this.

54
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,340
You're right.
When you give somebody food,

55
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,120
you feed them,
right?

56
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,180
But when you give somebody water,
what is that verb called?

57
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,880
You were water.
Then there.

58
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,080
There's no word for that.
Is there?

59
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,640
What is the word for when you give 
somebody water?

60
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:21,100
When you give them a drink.
Not Feed.

61
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,090
Could you say feed them water?
You drink them.

62
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,190
There's no word.
How is there no word for that?

63
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,630
Clench your watch.
Oh,

64
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,730
I quenched him.
No,

65
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,320
your water flowers,
right?

66
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,760
Yeah,
but you don't want.

67
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,743
That doesn't mean this like I.
This has been really troubling me this 

68
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,030
week.
People say Ethan,

69
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,290
serious troubles.
People say,

70
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,183
Ethan,
you haven't been posting video 

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,673
disappeared.
What?

72
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,820
Have you been traveling?
Yeah,

73
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,620
I hadn't been able to get over the fact 
this whole week that there's no word for

74
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:58,030
the word to drink to give somebody water
and the English language we have,

75
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,253
we're celebrated for having $100 
thousand in the world going by far the 

76
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:06,310
most words of any language that ever 
existed.

77
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,173
English language,
no word for giving water and anybody in 

78
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,640
the chat got to answer.
There's no chat.

79
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:15,100
There's no chat.
That's true.

80
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,880
I don't think there's A.
I don't think that exists to drink,

81
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,000
so that's been really keeping me up at 
night.

82
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,893
Frankly speaking.
Maybe in the comments you guys will 

83
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:27,464
figure it out,

84
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,753
but guys,
I googled it and for a baby you suckle 

85
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:33,060
them well.
Yeah,

86
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:36,360
that sounds right.
Yeah.

87
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:39,270
My friend was thirsty so I suckled him 
some of my water.

88
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,790
I think that that sounds like.
I was like,

89
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:42,624
hey buddy,
here you think is suckling the 

90
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:51,950
microphone for audio.
You got to work for third.

91
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,050
I'm thirsty.
So what happens with somebody is thirsty

92
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,810
and you gave them something.
There's no word,

93
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,610
there's no freaking word.
How is there no word for that?

94
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,223
You does that mind bending like,
and I've gone my whole life to until 

95
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:11,874
this week without realizing that that's 
what's weird to this person is saying I 

96
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:17,730
would go with hydrate,
get real.

97
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,400
You know what?
How can I have some water?

98
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,170
Yeah.
Here the hydrate,

99
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,550
hydrate,
you know,

100
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:24,870
that's not right.
Feed.

101
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,640
I fed him.
There's no freaking word

102
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,390
for some reason you would say water.
The horse water.

103
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:39,091
The horse.
Oh,

104
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:40,040
water.
The flour.

105
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,730
But it's not for people.
You could water a horse proudly.

106
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:47,250
You could say feeding and watering the 
horses so you could water the.

107
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,610
I mean,
it's a little confusing to be honest.

108
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,310
Half of me expects that somebody is just
going to say it.

109
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:52,851
And I'm like,
oh,

110
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:54,290
of course.
Yeah.

111
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,740
Uh,
you tinkle tinkle like,

112
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,940
oh,
obviously no,

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,240
there's no freaking word.
So I'm,

114
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:04,730
I'm looking to this ongoing debate about
your wish.

115
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,320
There was a chat right now.
Yeah,

116
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,930
it'd be nice.
Can we invent a word?

117
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,990
Like what works with fed feed and drank?
I drank them some water.

118
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,480
That sounds weird.
She made a little [inaudible].

119
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,960
So anyway,
let's get on with it.

120
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:24,380
All right.
I got a good one actually.

121
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,813
I've never heard of this word before.
Apparently this is a thing to slake 

122
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,323
someone.

123
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,830
Okay.
Like a lake,

124
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,660
but with dance.
Hey Dan,

125
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,140
get the frick out of town.
Nobody it.

126
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,280
Nobody on this show,
right?

127
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,720
This is a family show,
Dan.

128
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,100
I'm like,
as a new one to me,

129
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:46,280
I don't know guys.
We've got a lot to get to today.

130
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,114
All my God,
we've got Alex Jones banned from every 

131
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:50,930
social media.
I got some thoughts about that.

132
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:53,150
I think you guys might enjoy listening 
to or not.

133
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,823
It was one of the things when you 
express your opinion about something 

134
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:56,744
like that,
it's like,

135
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,703
I liked you.
I followed you for years up until this 

136
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:00,764
very moment when our opinions diverse on
this one thing and now I'm going to 

137
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,450
stalk you and threaten your family.

138
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,693
Okay.

139
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,110
It's just an opinion,
folks.

140
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,710
You might disagree with it,
but it's just my opinion.

141
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,720
It's not a right opinion,
so that's coming up.

142
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,150
Very excited about that.
Ajit pies.

143
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:17,984
Back in the news.
I'm excited to talk about the fact that 

144
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,283
me and Isla trying to have kids and I 
went to a fertility clinic and squirted 

145
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,813
in a cup to analyze my semen and it was 
a fricking weird and wild experience 

146
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,920
that I can't wait.
I took the pictures.

147
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,710
I want to tell you that it was something
else,

148
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:34,544
man,
and a lot of other really exciting 

149
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:36,434
headlines.
I you guys are gonna love there was 

150
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,410
apparently in Louisiana.
We'll save it.

151
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,700
I'll save it.
I'll save it.

152
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:45,020
My dudes.
I'm going to save it all,

153
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,680
but before we get into all of that,
it's the goal for the day.

154
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,600
What do we got?
Let's break the ice.

155
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,620
Does the good for the day work?
Yo.

156
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,790
Let's break the ice.
Not Saying,

157
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,050
hey,
Pierce Morgan tries to sound smart.

158
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,233
Okay.

159
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,690
On Good Morning Britain.
I haven't seen this one.

160
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,860
Her forehead's really glowing on her 
forehead.

161
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,480
Very Cup.
That is for glow.

162
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:15,314
Like you should think.
She's trying to be reflective here and 

163
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,950
it's like,
whoa.

164
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,473
But that's not a good look.
It just looks like she got a greasy ass 

165
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,300
for it.
I mean,

166
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,010
I'm not trying to make fun,
I shouldn't make fun of her.

167
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm just saying.
I'm just saying it could be that she was

168
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:30,920
going for that.
There is makeup for that.

169
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,193
I,
I'm just saying if you put her at the 

170
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:35,630
top of a light tower and spun her ass 
around,

171
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,590
you could probably navigate some ships,
don't you?

172
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,920
No,
no,

173
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,023
no,
no,

174
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,540
no,
no,

175
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,960
no.
It's really not that bad.

176
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,610
So anyway.
Um,

177
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,410
so even a brief history of time,

178
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,670
definitely just avoid those types yet to
treat a girl.

179
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,523
Ryan,
read the brief history of time by 

180
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,623
Professor Stephen.
A brief history of time is that history 

181
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:05,054
is the study into black holes.
Pythagoras theorem to the nearest five 

182
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,693
decimal places.

183
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,700
Do you have a favorite color?
This is like I'm,

184
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,480
I'm embodied by so much cringe that he's
trying to like make her look stupid.

185
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:21,843
Ask Good in understanding that if you 
ever read a brief history of time by 

186
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:29,540
Professor Stephen Hawking,
I'm like trying to see like,

187
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,403
oh,
you're dumb.

188
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,750
I don't think this girl ever tried to 
sound smart.

189
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,580
I don't think she ever presumed to be 
smart.

190
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,153
And then so the genius Piers Morgan 
measure being a grown man to try to 

191
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,070
humiliate some girl who's obviously not 
the brightest,

192
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,400
but she's not out here being like trying
to get a Phd dissertation,

193
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,320
you know,
she's dumb and she knows it.

194
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,533
He's like,
have you ever read this book by 

195
00:09:57,141 --> 00:10:02,141
Professor Stephen Hawking,
who has except fucking nerds?

196
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,250
But like,
um,

197
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,910
she's not up there trying to be smart 
dude,

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,160
what are you trying to disprove?
She knows she's dumb.

199
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,881
She's like,
no,

200
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,680
I'm not into that stuff.
I'm an idiot.

201
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,630
You know that like,
what's your point?

202
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,393
And then the best part is this,
he exposes himself to be the real turd 

203
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:26,120
sandwich.
Let's see it.

204
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,250
Three point one,
four,

205
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,140
seven.
There's certainly the first four digits.

206
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,250
Fucking idiot.
Here's the best part.

207
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,923
First of all,
he named the digits for something 

208
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:47,240
entirely else.
It's pie and he gets it wrong.

209
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,000
Nice.
I don't know that.

210
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:50,900
That's just what they said.

211
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,860
You knew that,
didn't you?

212
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,930
Haley was wrong.

213
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,933
Maybe I read that,
but like a normal person when wouldn't 

214
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,580
know that pierce yet.
Bip.

215
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,323
Yeah.

216
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,440
You just showed yourself.
I don't even

217
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,080
know how you get back on the TV after 
that humiliation,

218
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,470
but.
So that's a bit of a goof of the day.

219
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,640
What were you saying,
Dan?

220
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,430
Ian has an answer about the drink 
situation.

221
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,383
No,
I just typed that when you said only 

222
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,890
nerds have read that book.
Ian's like,

223
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,880
I'm kidding.
I thought about.

224
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,770
I've thought about picking up booklet.
I'm sorry again.

225
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,493
And it's like fuck.
And do you know the pie to the fifth 

226
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,600
digit?
Uh,

227
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,680
no.
Fucking idiot.

228
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:49,890
What a moron.
You idiot.

229
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,070
What else?
We have one other good for the day.

230
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:55,900
Yoko Ono,
the legendary.

231
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,940
A lover soulmate of the great John 
Lennon artists.

232
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,881
Artists.
Yeah,

233
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:03,490
I don't,
I don't mean to discount her.

234
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:06,430
She's done so much more than just be the
soul mate of John,

235
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,403
of John Lennon.
So she's come out with a new album and 

236
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:15,010
she released a new single that I thought
was a provocative,

237
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,530
emotional,
um,

238
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:20,650
incredible moving things moving.
It's called war zone.

239
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,510
Excuse me guys.
So she's continuing her legacy,

240
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,630
just trying to kick it and if you're 
trying to turn up the party or maybe put

241
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:40,120
yourself to bed with some relaxing 
towns,

242
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,643
either recommend Yoko Ono.
Warzone war zone is available for 

243
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,960
preorder now at Yoko Ono,
warzone.com.

244
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,853
One word

245
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,650
and the vocals words and music by Yoko 
Ono produced by Yoko Ono.

246
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,180
And um,
it really does it all she is,

247
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:09,181
is she's got it all.
Drawing from the new album war zone

248
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,653
preorder everywhere.

249
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,990
Oh,
come on now.

250
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,690
Preach it girl.
Out The war zone out there.

251
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,080
There's sometimes

252
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,250
bad singers that are like,
Bob Dylan's a bad singer.

253
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,010
So anyone can see they've made a ball.
No,

254
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:52,520
I don't think Bob Dylan's a bad singer,
but it's like they take it too far.

255
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,230
Yeah.
Whoa.

256
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,083
Hey,

257
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,470
I'm feeling it.
I'm feeling it.

258
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,020
So you can expect it

259
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,750
to be seeing this in the club on the 
radio.

260
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,320
How is this not on youtube trending?
It will be after this.

261
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,070
After this h three bumps.
Just needed a little exposure.

262
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,150
Anyway,
guys,

263
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,983
as I said,
preorders are available now while 

264
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,334
supplies last.
Is it bad to make fun of somebody for 

265
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:39,590
their artist?
I'm not making fun.

266
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:42,100
I'm indoors.
I'm an independent artist.

267
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,270
I'm promoting independent artist doing 
that.

268
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,110
Or is that.
We're interested in joining some art and

269
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:53,111
now my dude's onto the main story at 
Alex Jones.

270
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,140
You all know him.
The notorious conspiracy theorist,

271
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,303
right wing.
I want to say a lot of people consider 

272
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:00,800
them right,
right wing.

273
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,370
I don't consider them right when I 
consider him an alien.

274
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,680
I feel like I'm making them affiliated 
with a political party is like trying to

275
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:13,880
pin down like um,
what country you exist to on Mars.

276
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,300
I don't know if that made sense.
I feel like even Martha's to or is to.

277
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,190
Is to,
to grounded of it.

278
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,220
Yeah.
Now the time.

279
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,890
Well anyway,
we'll get into that,

280
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:29,010
but essentially you guys know Alex 
Jones,

281
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,940
Info wars.
He was recently banned by Youtube,

282
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,380
apple,
spotify,

283
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:40,960
and facebook banned all the channels 
removed.

284
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,030
He has been making videos since about 
early 2001 now.

285
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,923
Today.
He's mostly known for conspiracy 

286
00:15:49,211 --> 00:15:54,211
theories and he's very right leaning and
that he has a lot of conspiracy theories

287
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:55,384
and a lot of targeted opinions about 
like Hillary Clinton and Obama and what 

288
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,980
do you call the pizza gate stuff he was 
deep into.

289
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,853
I find it kind of interesting if you go 
back into 2001 just to lay the 

290
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:13,870
groundwork on who this guy is.
Back in 2001.

291
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:14,704
I have this clip from waking life.
He wasn't really a politically 

292
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:19,630
affiliated guy.
I just found this interesting.

293
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,800
He was very much

294
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,660
antigovernment,
anti-party propaganda,

295
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,520
rolling across the picket line,
lay down,

296
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,863
lay down Gi.
We saw it all about the government 

297
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:40,760
system of control.
Very much

298
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,510
specifically says in this clip like that
he's not a member of any party.

299
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,780
So somehow his,
his,

300
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,653
you know,
his style has changed since then 

301
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,773
regardless.

302
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,240
Um,
so this is what happened.

303
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,760
This is from verge,
which is confirmed by Youtube.

304
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,680
They confirmed this,
this information here,

305
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,633
conspiracy theorist Alex Jones,
Youtube Channel received a strike on 

306
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:09,020
Tuesday for violating the site's 
community guidelines.

307
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:12,000
The verge has learned youtube for videos
from Jonestown,

308
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,853
which has two point 4 million 
subscribers that contain instances of 

309
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,870
hate speech,
child endangerment sources,

310
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,810
mailer with the matters set.
Youtube channels are deleted if they get

311
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:21,644
three strikes in a three month period to
videos contained hate speech against 

312
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:25,844
Muslims,
a third contain hate speech against 

313
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:28,094
transgender people.
Sources said a fourth show to child who 

314
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,970
was pushed to the ground by an adult man
under the headline.

315
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,220
How to prevent liberalism.
All for the videos.

316
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,713
Yeah,
I,

317
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,420
I'll for the videos are currently posted
on info wars.

318
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,403
Now,
obviously I can't speak about those 

319
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:43,370
specific for videos because it's so hard
to find.

320
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,930
I mean his shit's been scorched earth 
from Youtube and shit.

321
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,330
So it's really hard to find the clips 
and question.

322
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,643
So I'm just,
you know,

323
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,080
reading the description.
Uh,

324
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,720
but this one I do have the offending 
video.

325
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,570
Oh,
those videos don't include a new one,

326
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:01,404
which was one of his new greatest hits 
of him making a threatening rant about 

327
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:06,360
Robert Mueller,
Mueller,

328
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:07,740
or molar.
You alert.

329
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,540
I always taught it's smaller,
but he didn't get it.

330
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,590
He says,
so I'm confused.

331
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,813
Were stirred a controversy earlier this 
week after it was posted on facebook 

332
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:20,280
that it does not appear to have been 
uploaded to youtube.

333
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,930
Post on Info wars to the view had been 
posted in a news documentary,

334
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:26,820
scientific,
artistic contact,

335
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,530
by the way there.
Anyway,

336
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,390
the first reach out to info wars,
Yada Yada,

337
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:31,224
Yada.
Jones channel previously received 

338
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:36,990
strikes from youtube in February after 
promoted the false theory that survivors

339
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:37,824
of the Parkland shooting were actually 
trained crisis actors that violated 

340
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:42,570
youtube policy against harassment and 
bullying,

341
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,780
but strikes expired three months after 
they are issued.

342
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,120
Dot Jones channel currently had just one
strike against him.

343
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,643
Now.
I actually was able to find the clip of 

344
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:55,680
him talking about Robert Muller.
And,

345
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:57,030
um,
I thought,

346
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:57,750
well,
let's,

347
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,990
let's see what kind of stuff this guy is
saying you the question right now,

348
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,240
the real debate is like,
is this a,

349
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,913
it's being framed by the people who 
support Alex Jones as a political 

350
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,943
silencing that he's being shut down 
because all these big tech companies 

351
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:18,300
are,
are super liberal leaning and it's a,

352
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,850
it's a,
it's a political shut down,

353
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,110
right?
It's censorship,

354
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,700
right?
So I'm like,

355
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:24,534
all right,
well like some of the videos they 

356
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:29,680
described could easily be like 
completely open to debate.

357
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,800
Look,
they're like pushing the children to the

358
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:32,400
ground.
So like,

359
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,570
I don't know,
I'd have to see that.

360
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,110
Who knows?
But here I have this one of molar,

361
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,020
so let's watch this.
Let me pop this baby open.

362
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,590
Now,
this just happened very recently.

363
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,060
Muir,
everyone's so scared of Mueller.

364
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,290
So I'm saying in front of people what 
she did.

365
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,213
So here we go.
This is what he's saying about one 

366
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,353
sheets.
Mueller molar is like a lifelong 

367
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:59,320
Republican,
solid.

368
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:00,154
I mean,
he's one of the most beautiful guys 

369
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,900
ever.
Like now everyone looks at Mola,

370
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:04,734
like he's the fucking are not a lot,
but a lot of lot of people see them as 

371
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:12,090
like a total piece of shit con man.
But I remember Donald Trump tweeting out

372
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:13,590
when the investigation started,
something like that.

373
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,990
I'm glad it's molar because he's so 
respected.

374
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,530
So now all of a sudden,
here's what we're saying about Mueller,

375
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,230
everyone's so scared of Mueller,
Mueller,

376
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,780
rape kids in front of people.
What she did mean,

377
00:20:23,781 --> 00:20:27,420
Mueller covered up for a decade for 
Epstein kidnapping kids,

378
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:30,930
flying them on sex planes.
Some kids as young as seven years old,

379
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:35,550
reportedly with big perverts raping them
to frame people.

380
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,400
I mean,
Mueller is a monster man.

381
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,473
Cod.
Imagine he's even above the pedophiles 

382
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,190
though.
So I mean,

383
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,410
well,
right off the bat,

384
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,570
can you.
I don't know if not that,

385
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,050
if it's hard statements,
if.

386
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,800
I mean you can't really call a guy.
He's like,

387
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:57,070
do you use straight up watched people 
rape kids?

388
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,270
Like that's kind of.
What's the word?

389
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,460
It's a bold claim.
It's not a bold claim.

390
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,920
It's a slander,
frankly speaking.

391
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,270
All right.
You can't just be like,

392
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:08,380
dude,
I have.

393
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,543
I know.
I know for a fact that Alex Jones 

394
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:14,350
watches people,
rape kids,

395
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,870
that right and strong statement.
Let's keep watching.

396
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,760
I mean,
slander.

397
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,290
I,
all that is slander or does.

398
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,124
He doesn't have sexual kids.
He just controls it all interested in 

399
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:25,600
fucking kids.
He just likes to,

400
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:26,890
uh,
facilitate

401
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,280
ajit being a monster like that.
God,

402
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,690
God,
all people say,

403
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:33,780
well God,
you scared of him.

404
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,530
I'm scared of not manning up.

405
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,143
Dude,
are you don't just scared of talking 

406
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,384
about this.

407
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,513
Good.

408
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,563
Let's give him one main fear.
I'm not being a real man and I'm not 

409
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:54,100
doing what it takes and I'm not telling 
the truth.

410
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,910
And so call it whatever you want.
I look at that guy,

411
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:58,744
he's a sex offender.
The Danes and I will take down or I'll 

412
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,600
try and sell that shit.
Gonna Happen.

413
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,370
We're gonna.
Walk out the square politically high,

414
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,750
noon and he's on to find out what he 
makes you move,

415
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:11,584
man.
Make the move first and then it's going 

416
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:15,840
to happen.
It's not a joke.

417
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,990
That's not a gain.
So real world politically,

418
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,090
you're going to get it or I'm going to 
try a bitch.

419
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,710
I didn't notice.
You actually was saying

420
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,570
politically right now.
Yeah.

421
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,080
I don't know.
What does he mean by that?

422
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,950
Well,
it isn't.

423
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,420
It's very.
I mean it's very.

424
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,063
When you're,
when you're accusing somebody of like 

425
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:39,740
basically raping kids.
I mean we hold that in our culture to be

426
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:40,574
one of the worst things possible to the 
point that where you don't even respect 

427
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,080
their life.
When you degrade someone to the point of

428
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:48,020
being a child rapist,
really when you're saying,

429
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:48,830
Hey,
I'm going to,

430
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,650
I'm going to shoot you.
If somebody goes,

431
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,440
if somebody who believes that he's a 
pedophile goes and murders him,

432
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,903
am I like,
if were to believe that he's actually 

433
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,200
like organizing a massive pedophile 
ring,

434
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:01,640
how much sympathy do you have for the 
guy?

435
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,370
Right.
So this,

436
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,960
this shit you,
you really.

437
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,860
I mean,
I feel like he's just doing a character,

438
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,713
right?
And like a overexaggerating everything 

439
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:16,250
and it could be entertaining when you're
watching it through that Lens,

440
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,113
but from what I understand,
a lot of people take him seriously and 

441
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,670
believe that he's believing what he's 
saying.

442
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,060
So I don't think he really believes what
he says,

443
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,640
like about all the crazy stuff that he.
Well,

444
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,900
there.
That's definitely debatable.

445
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,870
Um,
hey guys,

446
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,690
uh,
let me cut in real quick it.

447
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,190
Yeah.
Wow.

448
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,380
We uh,
we just got taken down by youtube.

449
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,960
They just killed her stream.
Really?

450
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,250
Yep.
Why?

451
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,890
Community guidelines.
Wow.

452
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:54,190
We can't even show his footage.
What never been removed.

453
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,720
How stupid are you?
Youtube.

454
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,340
Alright,
we are back.

455
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,530
We were live streaming and bright as we 
were getting into it.

456
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,090
You guys saw,
if you're watching the Vod,

457
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,193
youtube in their infinite wisdom teeth 
removed our live stream and gave us a 

458
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:17,780
strike,
which basically when you get a strike,

459
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:22,781
you can't live stream anymore,
so some genius over at live to live.

460
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,600
I'm having a fucking.
I'm not.

461
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,860
You see what it's doing to me,
shredders freaking out.

462
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:33,200
We've been sitting here for like an hour
trying to figure out what to do.

463
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,900
Some fucking genius was like,
Oh,

464
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:42,770
they're talking about Alex Jones.
Let's remove the fucking.

465
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:43,963
You know what it is so insane is that my
whole rant as I was just getting into 

466
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,783
was very.
I'm taking Youtube side that Alex Jones 

467
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:58,400
is a crazy conspiracy theorist who 
violated the terms of service,

468
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,533
was doing all this shit that shouldn't 
buy youtubes terms of service shouldn't 

469
00:25:03,231 --> 00:25:08,231
be allowed and what the fuck does 
youtube do?

470
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,540
Did like,
you know what we need to do?

471
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,810
They'll sit around and think of what's 
the best thing to do right now?

472
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,640
The most best thing they're like will 
make us look so much better.

473
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,120
Ethan is defending us.
Ethan,

474
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,180
who's defending us against Alex Jones 
right now.

475
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,253
Do you know what we can do in one fell 
swoop to legitimize Alex Jones and to 

476
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:39,330
pitch Ethan often turn them against us.
Let's shut as channel down and give them

477
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,010
a strike mid live stream.

478
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,750
It's brilliant.
Let's do that.

479
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,970
Shut it down.
What the fuck?

480
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,970
Like how can I even sit here now and 
call Alex Jones,

481
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:54,170
conspiracy theorists when our child just
got strike down for even fucking talking

482
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:55,190
about him.
Not even.

483
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,180
I was criticizing him.
We were analyzing the situation.

484
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,170
What are the how?
Who watched that and thought to himself,

485
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,063
this needs to be taken down right now.
I was literally just talking about how 

486
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:10,310
he defamed Robert,
Robert Mueller,

487
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,560
Mueller.
They're like,

488
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:13,394
dude,
you know what we could do to make the 

489
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:19,010
situation even worse for us.
They're like,

490
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,290
this was like a beautiful play by them 
too.

491
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:26,291
Like in one fell swoop we can turn ethan
against us who's usually critical bus,

492
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,790
but in this time he's defending us.
We can.

493
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,400
Alex Jones was an explosive,
sensitive situation.

494
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:32,234
Everybody's saying that it's a 
conspiracy theory to censor the right 

495
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:38,030
wing media and one fell swoop.
What can we do?

496
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,210
Well,
that's all fit and think I've got it.

497
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,500
Strike their live screaming or remove 
their ability to

498
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,730
broadcast.
Let me look at my context.

499
00:26:49,731 --> 00:26:53,970
We do have Ethan's number.
We could reach out to him real quick and

500
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:54,960
say,
Hey,

501
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,790
I don't even know what they wanted to 
say,

502
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:57,624
but

503
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,510
no,
no,

504
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:58,760
no,
no,

505
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,520
no,
no.

506
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,970
Let's be reasonable.
You know,

507
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:02,804
this is so stupid.
I have to say this is so dumb because 

508
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:05,504
now the people that I was criticizing 
are going to use this as evidence to 

509
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:10,610
say,
hey,

510
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,443
this is proof.
There's a conspiracy against this after 

511
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:13,964
all,
and you know what?

512
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,490
It's hard for me now to argue against 
that.

513
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,430
Do you understand how fucking stupid you
are?

514
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:20,264
Youtube here.
Let me show you some of my notes and I 

515
00:27:26,451 --> 00:27:27,140
was going to talk about.

516
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,420
They even knew that we were going to 
talk about it.

517
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,283
They gave you.

518
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,723
I consulted with somebody high up in 
Youtube before this episode to get a 

519
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:35,384
statement from them here.
Let me show you some of my notes that a 

520
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,870
deborah got to air this.
Never got to air a blast.

521
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,210
What's,
what is it called?

522
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,243
Goddammit.
Slander against molar threats of 

523
00:27:50,631 --> 00:27:53,780
violence.
Clear violation of the terms of use.

524
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,123
Sandy Hook was was a crisis actor.
I've got this whole great piece about 

525
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:07,210
that so I can't talk about this now.
How am I going to talk?

526
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,493
Oh,
there's no conspiracy that was fucking 

527
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,453
defending you

528
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:22,460
and now I'm offline.
Nobody's even watching me.

529
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:23,680
Right?
It's so weird.

530
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:24,980
It's like,
who are we talking to?

531
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:25,843
Nobody.

532
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:31,590
I'm off flying.
I'm off the fricking grid right now.

533
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,510
It's just me,
you

534
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,930
and shredder.
Who's really upset because he hasn't got

535
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:41,870
walked into frikking hours and it was 
supposed to only be here for one hour.

536
00:28:41,871 --> 00:28:43,100
We supposed to be done.
Now.

537
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:43,983
I even prepared a soundbite.
Destroy the child because I was goofing 

538
00:28:47,441 --> 00:28:48,290
on.
Alex Jones,

539
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:53,240
so much brick and pissed off.
We had this amazing.

540
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:58,650
It doesn't make any sense now because I 
can't go on and on about.

541
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,110
All right,
let me just summarize my points.

542
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,320
Sandy Hook,
crisis.

543
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,000
That's inappropriate.
It was an Anderson Cooper green screen.

544
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,350
The bumped it.
Here's a lawsuit.

545
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,490
Yeah.
Sandy Hook.

546
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:12,770
Parents are suing,
uh,

547
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,993
suing Alex Jones because they can't 
visit their child's grave because 

548
00:29:19,011 --> 00:29:21,350
they're being harassed by lunatics.
Oh Wow.

549
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,213
Who Cares?

550
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,550
And the five years since,
uh,

551
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,970
our son was killed.
Death threats.

552
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:32,330
It online harassment have forced us to 
leave the city and relocate seven times.

553
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,000
Wow.
Big Deal or challenged,

554
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,853
discussed,
shut down.

555
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,400
They now live in a high security 
community.

556
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,680
A hundred miles away from there were the
six year old was buried.

557
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,540
I love to go see my son's and I don't 
get to do that because we made the right

558
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:45,880
decision to move away.
Destroy the child.

559
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,290
You see I have content.
That story is pretty crazy.

560
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,910
How am I supposed to actually like be 
like,

561
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:56,911
Oh yeah,
I've got all this.

562
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:04,370
I mean,
I also see a lot of people saying it was

563
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:10,221
a coordinated attack.
Shut us down.

564
00:30:11,301 --> 00:30:13,430
It doesn't seem that far fetched 
anymore.

565
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,310
What do I do?
Do I just show the edit we made?

566
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,373
It's pretty damn good.
It's such a shame not to prepare an 

567
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:24,861
edit.
Well,

568
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:28,010
okay.
The edit is not really editorialized.

569
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:33,170
It's really have a memorial dedicated to
Alex Jones channel being removed.

570
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,820
Okay.
It's,

571
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,620
you guys really messed up.
I'm looking over.

572
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,490
I,
I planned this really great segment,

573
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:41,670
you know,
but I can't,

574
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,140
I can't in good mine.
I can't say it

575
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:49,530
because I just got shot down.
So with that being said,

576
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,880
we are just going to show you the edit 
we made and uh,

577
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,330
in honor of Alex Jones,
who was a,

578
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,230
you know,
a character,

579
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,123
a hilarious guy,
if you will say now it just sounds like 

580
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:09,250
I'm praising him after that whole 
fucking list of grievances.

581
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,063
So insane.
And now now look like I hate when this 

582
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:14,524
happens.
Now all of a sudden I always get shit 

583
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:18,340
for being like a right way of fringe,
right wing,

584
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:22,310
like sympathizer.
And now I'm the.

585
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,000
I continue to be the darling of the 
right,

586
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,380
defending Alex Jones.
Why do you put me in this situation?

587
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,530
I am not that I am here to criticize and
defend you.

588
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,800
And now look where it got me.
Oh,

589
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,690
Ethan,
the darling of the.

590
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:44,470
All right.
Defending Alex Jones.

591
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Thank you for defending everything.
Because you clearly have a point here.

592
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,010
Alright,
fuck sake.

593
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,630
Just roll the edit for Christ sake.
Do I do commercial after that?

594
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,740
Thirteen months.
I know your mustache is cool.

595
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,400
Classes.
I will go to.

596
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:14,080
Amanda.
Made it start your journey to super male

597
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:19,081
vitality to stop your ass.
Little Communist.

598
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,720
I'm a human trauma.
He's going to come together.

599
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,363
We know we're under attack.
I never expected trump charging into a 

600
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:37,630
goblins,
Nash to not get some Goblin vomit,

601
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,523
swap and blood on him.
I don't want to see them kissing 

602
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:41,114
goblins.
Spider goats are at least two peer 

603
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,190
bashing and because I don't like gay 
people,

604
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,143
I don't like putting chemicals in the 
water that turn the frigging slobs gay 

605
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,693
gay.
It'll take all children at birth and 

606

755
00:40:47,701 --> 00:40:51,420
which is the most priceless of all 
resources available to men,

756
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,790
right?
Saves you that.

757
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,070
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash eight.
Three.

758
00:40:56,071 --> 00:40:56,904
That's for him.
[inaudible] dot com slash h three four 

759
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:04,740
[inaudible] dot com slash h three.
Keep that beautiful head of hair.

760
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:10,430
Don't let it fade away like all your 
dreams have to this point in life.

761
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,050
We are back and I am still upset.
Took a little break,

762
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,120
stIll met.
Frankly,

763
00:41:20,121 --> 00:41:22,940
I feel like I'm.
I feel a little bit like this right now.

764
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:27,830
That's how I feel.
All right

765
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:28,663
now.
Now I actually did speak with you too 

766
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,680
were offline.
Nobody's listening.

767
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,380
I know it's weird,
but we.

768
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,270
So they were moving the strike.
Okay.

769
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,163
We can live stream now,
but I mean obviously we have to finish 

770
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,690
offline.
Started already.

771
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,220
We're going to combine the episodes.
They said they were wrong.

772
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,470
It was a mistake.
Whatever that means.

773
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,380
Somebody removed the video.
It wasn't.

774
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,150
If they could.
Let's put it this way.

775
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,070
They.
If they could redo it again,

776
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:58,750
they would leave the video up.
Somebody is probably getting fired today

777
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,240
promoting.
You think someone's getting fired.

778
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,103
It was just some grunt.
That's how you mistake is that you just 

779
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:11,021
go and give someone a strike and they 
have like really up to use rules.

780
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,990
It's like some grunt who's making $10 an
hour in India for all I know.

781
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,180
You know what I'm saying?
And it's like these,

782
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:17,750
these low.

783
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,750
This is how youtube format and it's just
so ridiculous that Alex Jones video.

784
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,140
Yeah,
they.

785
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,990
They saw it as a re upload and not 
somebody talking about it.

786
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,230
Obviously you could talk about it,
so they said it was a mistake,

787
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,930
but like this is a problem with how 
youtube formats to their company.

788
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:34,390
It's so ridiculous.
There's some,

789
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,900
some ridiculous.
Shut down our stream.

790
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,060
They know us.
They have our phone number.

791
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:43,040
They know we were going to talk about 
it.

792
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:46,760
It's like you guys never went,
never went beyond,

793
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,640
you know,
an 18 year old dudes.

794
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:52,430
First job who's making $10 an hour,
who was just like,

795
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,473
I got reported or this matches Alex 
Jones content that shouldn't be 

796
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,520
uploaded.
He opens it and he's like,

797
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,230
you know what?
Fuck this guy.

798
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:01,940
It's like,
damn,

799
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,940
come on ya'll.
All right.

800
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,070
I don't know how to move on and how 
it's.

801
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:15,071
I don't know how we're going to talk 
about a score it in a aqap god squirting

802
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:19,094
and a cup so upset that were offline 
right now and the whole episode is so 

803
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:27,950
weird now because like we're like,
how do you talk about something else?

804
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:33,230
I'm going to try.
Let's get off this.

805
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,413
So the other week I went to a fertility 
clinic because we're trying to have a 

806
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:47,261
kid.
We don't know what we've been,

807
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:48,464
you know,
we've been trying to been trying to 

808
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:54,610
fucking knock you up for like how long?
I don't know.

809
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,040
I'm just fucking

810
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,370
make some damn babies.
Sometimes I wonder.

811
00:44:04,371 --> 00:44:04,971
I'm like,
shit,

812
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:08,210
maybe.
I see friends with kids and I'm like,

813
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:09,580
damn,
I don't know if I want married.

814
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,680
It's not.
Maybe we shouldn't do this dog.

815
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,840
I do like this late at night of sleep.
I don't like it was too much.

816
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:23,030
But at night I'm prefer to sleep.
I love sleep.

817
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,130
We have friends with kids.
They're like,

818
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,800
it's been two years.
They're like,

819
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:28,360
yeah,
we don't have a.

820
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,360
Yeah,
I hate my life.

821
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,730
They're like,
oh,

822
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,330
kids are the best.
Meanwhile,

823
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,510
kids are the best thing you'll ever do.
Meanwhile it's like,

824
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,660
yeah,
I didn't get any sleep.

825
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,850
I have to leave every time we hang out 
at 3:00

826
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:42,683
PM.
I've tried praying to escape my family 

827
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,860
for any.
For five minutes at a time.

828
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:49,800
Yeah.
It's really great.

829
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,103
So anyway,

830
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,430
why do we all want to do it to 
ourselves?

831
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,460
Why do you want,
why do we want kids?

832
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:02,430
Like what is wrong with us?
It's just we have a shredder is perfect.

833
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:03,660
Yeah.
He's a perfect angel.

834
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,513
Like as perfectly as could be.
I remember how happy we were when we 

835
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:09,330
left them at home for like,
or we took them to the groomer yesterday

836
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,120
for like three hours and we left them at
the groomer.

837
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,390
I'm still paranoid about what happened 
in those three hours though.

838
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,560
We weren't with him.
Yeah.

839
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,313
I have a fear that they put a finger up 
his ass or something in a weird way 

840
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,950
because this dark rumors.
I'm telling you the truth.

841
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:25,933
Our groomers are fucking weird.
The woman who receives him doesn't have 

842
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,690
teeth.
She's literally toothless,

843
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,670
which she has like a nub,

844
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,540
but it's not in the way in her mouth,
but it's not a weird.

845
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,880
It's like a really nice place.
Yes.

846
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:43,320
But I have to say main local area.
Like it's not like we're taking him to a

847
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:45,630
weird place.
We're taking him to a nice place.

848
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,150
Right.
Five star reviews or whatever,

849
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,200
but in my mind if I were to imagine,
okay,

850
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,460
lady,
the fuck's dogs.

851
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:57,090
That's what I would imagine.
I think she goes shut.

852
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,810
Has this move when he cuddles with you 
that he looks inside your ear?

853
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,890
Yeah,
and so she goes,

854
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,510
she says to me,
what?

855
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,380
I just don't want.
I know where you're going with it and no

856
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:12,450
one this thought in my head.
Well I don't know what happened,

857
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:14,460
but she says to me when we went to pick 
them up,

858
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,061
she was like,
oh,

859
00:46:15,061 --> 00:46:16,080
that's his mobile phone.

860
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,280
That he licks in the ears.
I was like,

861
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:19,990
that sounds like shutter,
but I'm also like,

862
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:25,290
what situation is he?
Why is he up there?

863
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,330
What was she doing?
Was she.

864
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,120
Why was he is capable of putting his 
tongue and our ear.

865
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,530
You're thinking he gives good head

866
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,020
five.
You're thinking.

867
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:34,854
No,
but I was always afraid that you're 

868
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,250
going to say that she was enjoying it or
something.

869
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,140
That's not.
I'm not.

870
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,160
I'm not that.
He doesn't like peanut butter,

871
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,890
natural food that imagine what her mouth
looks like.

872
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,830
Imagine what her job looks

873
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:56,990
like.
No,

874
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,280
probably got rotting teeth in the I.
No,

875
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,150
no,
no.

876
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:08,200
So and so for,
at any rate,

877
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,550
imagine having a kid.
You leave your dog for three hours,

878
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,350
have to sick thoughts you have in your 
mind.

879
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,440
So anyway,
I went to,

880
00:47:17,441 --> 00:47:22,441
I went to a for tenor,
for tilty clinic to analyze my semen.

881
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,210
It's a funny situation that I wanted to 
talk about,

882
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:30,760
by the way,
checks out my sIemens great.

883
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:34,300
Let me normal.
It wasn't like,

884
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:35,163
dude,
you're assuming that the duck is like 

885
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:39,040
your semen is insane,
bro.

886
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,690
That's normal.
Said it's normal.

887
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,600
That's dank.
You're seen as normal.

888
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,150
That's dang.
So anyway,

889
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:50,770
you go to this little so it's just this 
little office.

890
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,113
they bring into this back a little room 
and they bring you into this room and 

891
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:55,901
they're like,
all right,

892
00:47:55,901 --> 00:48:00,670
well here's a cup.
you jerk and do and when you're done you

893
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:03,340
bring it out and there's like a little,
you know,

894
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,593
little window you open and then you put 
the cup in and you close it and I guess 

895
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:12,370
some other person back there gargles it 
and the same.

896
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:15,010
It's fine.
You know,

897
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,933
whatever they do.
And then I didn't even think about this 

898
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:19,510
stuff.
That would be funny though,

899
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,823
because you imagine there's like 
advanced machinery and they looking at 

900
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:23,974
it under a telescope,
but it's just some fucking weirdo 

901
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:29,800
gargles up like it's a little on the 
weak side.

902
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:32,080
I think it is.
Advanced Machinery.

903
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,830
Yeah.
It's just a funny thought.

904
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:34,703
Hilo.

905
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,370
Anyway,
I walked into the room and I was.

906
00:48:41,371 --> 00:48:44,000
So I was just repost.
I had,

907
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:47,250
I took a bunch of pictures of the room 
that I want to show you guys.

908
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,710
So let me,
let me open that up.

909
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,670
Where's all this shit?
My desktop can go away.

910
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,713
Fuck off.

911
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,610
Oh my god.
Anyway,

912
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,140
so here squirting.
And the cup pictures got a slideshow for

913
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:06,320
you guys.
So here's the room.

914
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,793
Oh,

915
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,010
hello.
Okay.

916
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,350
So here's the realm I want to describe 
it for audio listeners.

917
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,840
So this.
So,

918
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:19,923
so basically now what you're looking at 
his headphones that are plugged in to 

919
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:26,600
the tv.
Okay.

920
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:31,040
Now look next to it at the wall there's 
trips running down the wall,

921
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,913
like some dudes just jerked all over the
wall and there's stains on the 

922
00:49:37,971 --> 00:49:38,804
headphones are on the ground.
It's like imagine putting those on your 

923
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:43,640
head and why is it on the ground?
You'd look.

924
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,523
Look dude,
there's a huge drip look by the left 

925
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:48,620
headphone.
There's like a wet drip there.

926
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,790
You see that right here.
I'll put the mouse over it.

927
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:56,330
You see this is a splurge strip.
Oh,

928
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,860
you don't see it?
Oh look,

929
00:49:57,861 --> 00:49:59,270
there's this.
Hold on right here.

930
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,260
Oh,
so.

931
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,820
Okay.
So I was like,

932
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,140
holy shit.
Yeah.

933
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:11,283
So these are like,
they've got like playboys and stuff and 

934
00:50:13,681 --> 00:50:15,260
this.
Imagine touching that.

935
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,680
The sticky assets white.
Oh,

936
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:20,150
it's coming.
It's magazines.

937
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:20,984
It's on the wall and hustlers and shit.
But like this has been handled by 

938
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,380
thousands of dudes who have jerked 
before.

939
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:28,214
You imagine touching that feeling.
You got to wear like a hazmat suit when 

940
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,320
you walk into this room.
I dropped.

941
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:34,760
I was like,
when I walked in,

942
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:39,130
we'll wait till you see the chair.
Yeah,

943
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,233
just the look of this chair.
That's the first thing you see when you 

944
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:46,040
walk in the room.
Looks like a torture chair.

945
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,040
Crazy.
It's like a pee pad,

946
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:51,650
like striders pee pads.
It's like,

947
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,870
it's like you to do it.
That's fine,

948
00:50:53,871 --> 00:50:54,704
I'll totally jerk off in that chair.
Now that you've covered it with it's a 

949
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:58,654
pee pad.

950
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,300
What to do and they expect the year like
get naked and sit on that.

951
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,980
I don't know.
You got to do what you gotta do.

952
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:07,520
That's the only chair in the room.
I did a standing up.

953
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:13,630
I just dropped trial and I just got.
I just banged it out a little quick.

954
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,550
No matter how much in this chair was 
covered,

955
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:18,830
I would not say it on it.
No,

956
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,350
I was horrified when I walked in.
That's when I decided to get my camera.

957
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,330
When I saw this chair,
I was like,

958
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:26,500
this is unbelievable.
What do they expect that you're going to

959
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:30,020
jerk off onto the chair?
I dunno.

960
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,970
You know,
some weird dudes are into this.

961
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,570
They probably don't even.
They do this every week.

962
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,070
They really don't even need the 
analysis.

963
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,100
It just turns them on what?
This is.

964
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:41,330
So gross.
Here's the cup.

965
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,270
So you crack it open,
you do the deed and then you have to put

966
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,800
the exact time you squirted.

967
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,580
So it was like 1153 and you know the 
exact minute.

968
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,890
And what is it that,
because it's so huge,

969
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,160
because I guess,
you know,

970
00:51:55,190 --> 00:52:00,190
over time the semen degrades.
So lIke the minute matters.

971
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,590
I like it.
It's like right next to the tv remote.

972
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:04,424
So potentially my semen could be even 
stronger and they were just a couple 

973
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,740
minutes off.
Right?

974
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,750
Imagine touching anything in that room.
So they've got a tv with like porn on it

975
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:17,420
and you can put the headphones off and 
sit in the chair and jerk off,

976
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,970
which is insane.
I just stood right there.

977
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:22,190
I scored it All over the fucking chair 
and everything.

978
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,590
No,
I did look at this trashcan full of rag.

979
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,780
Oh my god.
They don't even emPty.

980
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,320
That's what it was when I walked in.
Just fall.

981
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,040
Rags,
like at least trashcan we to toP up.

982
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,340
Close up.
Why would it had funds on the ground?

983
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,200
Yeah,
I mean there's just a little.

984
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,600
So here's the situation.
Some lube,

985
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:49,970
a tiny really old tv.
I mean,

986
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:51,500
gosh didn't,
does that.

987
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,050
It cost money to do this.
Yeah,

988
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,840
it was like 200 bucks.
So what's with the shoot it wrong?

989
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:02,170
They don't even have money for like a 
nicer tv stand.

990
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,720
It's all.
It's all going to be on this tiny look.

991
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:06,554
I don't know what you know.
I know ladies needs some kind of 

992
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:10,580
romancing.
I literally,

993
00:53:10,581 --> 00:53:11,450
I was like,
listen,

994
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,110
I'm here.
I fucking dropped trial it.

995
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,420
I probably was in and out.

996
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,390
Okay.
No sound.

997
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,390
One minute.
I didn't want to spend another second in

998
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:25,560
there just by being in there with my 
dick out.

999
00:53:25,561 --> 00:53:28,350
I thought I was going to get worse oral 
thing.

1000
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:30,060
Empty.
It looks empty.

1001
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,450
It's very low.
You will get a lot of use.

1002
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:34,523
I mean just imagine like imagine this,
you're about to jerk off with this lube 

1003
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,540
and you have to touch.
Even the act of squirting it out.

1004
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:43,983
It's like they're not aware of how gross
I need to go in there and like a full 

1005
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:50,040
body condom.
That's it.

1006
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,850
That's my tour of the.
I can't believe ya.

1007
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,910
But then the weird thing is like you go 
in the room and then you,

1008
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:56,853
you do it in the cup and you bring it 
out and then you have to go back in the 

1009
00:53:58,891 --> 00:53:59,890
lobby,
meet the merck,

1010
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,773
the nurse.
So you let go and you face thIs middle 

1011
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:04,464
aged woman who's just turned it off and 
then you go to bailing and some old 

1012
00:54:09,261 --> 00:54:12,030
ladies like here's your,
here's your bill for jerking off.

1013
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:15,990
So weird.
Like in what situation can you just.

1014
00:54:15,991 --> 00:54:18,540
Everyone knows you're jerking off and 
it's all good.

1015
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:24,630
Here's the interesting thing.
So we all did our test.

1016
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,273
Everything is normal so maybe we should 
just not have a kid because it's a sign 

1017
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:31,734
from god.

1018
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:39,420
Just don't let me back in that room.
It's crazy.

1019
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,520
It's a crazy thing.
Yeah.

1020
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:46,764
You just sheepishly walk out.
They sit your ass in another lobby and 

1021
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:51,690
everyone's staring at you.
Like to just jerked off.

1022
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,700
That's what you feel like it was 
looking.

1023
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,950
Oh no,
they do it all day.

1024
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,840
They don't even care.
No,

1025
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:57,723
they don't care.
What if they ever see a guy like walk 

1026
00:55:01,171 --> 00:55:03,390
out and there's like some jazz on a shoe
or something?

1027
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:09,520
Probably they probably seen that small 
room.

1028
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:11,610
It's like they don't.
There's no room for error in there.

1029
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:16,611
Right.
Pretty wild stuff.

1030
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:19,693
Um,
we wanted to talk about youtube stream 

1031
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,880
podcast.
It's hard to get bAck into it.

1032
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:28,850
I'm exhausted because we'd been here for
like five hours.

1033
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:29,983
I'm like,
I'm worthless after a couPle of hours 

1034
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,880
when we do these.
My voice is already hurting from talking

1035
00:55:34,881 --> 00:55:36,430
so much.
We've just,

1036
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,420
we haven't even started.

1037
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,253
Alright.

1038
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:47,920
EPisodes sucks.
What else?

1039
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:51,730
We got ajit pi.
It's hard to go on.

1040
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:56,880
I'm exhausted.
We've got the segment from ian.

1041
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,970
Yeah,
I think we'll have to.

1042
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:00,893
We're going to axion segment.
Should we just bring them out and do a 

1043
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:05,190
segment?
let's just,

1044
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,220
let's just get through this.
Let's see.

1045
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,300
Let's,
let's slam through it.

1046
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,850
Ajit pi.
He's back.

1047
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,153
Oh,
I can't muster the strength to care 

1048
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:17,670
about this.
I just realized.

1049
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,530
How long has this been,
dan?

1050
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,320
Um,
well,

1051
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,370
because all of the starting and 
stopping.

1052
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:25,960
A little tough to say.
Let's see,

1053
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,040
uh,
probably just about an hour.

1054
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,490
The episodes an hour long.
Oh my god.

1055
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:36,220
It feels like we've been here for like a
week.

1056
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,970
yeah,
I think we're actually probably under an

1057
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:41,020
hour or even.
Oh my god.

1058
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,630
Are you serious?
Yeah.

1059
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,493
I mean the longest hour episode ever.
We've been recording for a 16 minutes 

1060
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,230
since we came back in from the sponsor 
read and I think we broke it.

1061
00:56:53,231 --> 00:56:56,620
The 35 minute mark sponsor reads about 
five minutes long.

1062
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,810
So yeah,
about an hour.

1063
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:04,050
Ajit pi.
You guys remember this fucking idiot.

1064
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,150
This idiot.
Let me show you.

1065
00:57:07,151 --> 00:57:12,151
This face has got the most goofy has 
goddamn face.

1066
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:18,490
And I say that only because he's such an
asshole.

1067
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:24,910
Actually it was facing the article 
you're going to open is funnier.

1068
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:25,963
Is it?
See,

1069
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:32,590
so ajit pi,
the chairman of the fcc lied to congress

1070
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:36,470
about allegedly cyber attacks.
That didn't actually happen.

1071
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:40,550
So when you guys remember this huge 
battle for net neutrality,

1072
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:43,150
we actually made a podcast about it to.
Oh,

1073
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,660
let me show this.
You mean this one here?

1074
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:48,200
I love the framing of that shot.
Can't talk.

1075
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,460
You can't ever complain.
Oh,

1076
00:57:49,461 --> 00:57:51,950
that's a bad photo of me.
When like your,

1077
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:56,620
your actual headshot looks like this,
like this guy just,

1078
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,790
he looks goofy in every photo.

1079
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:01,303
Come on,

1080
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,460
like that's his,
that's the picture on the wall.

1081
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,313
So

1082
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:13,050
this is the guy I don't remember.
We've talked about him.

1083
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:18,320
So ajit pi during this huge raging 
debate about net neutrality,

1084
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:22,930
um,
god,

1085
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:27,940
I can't muster the strength to care 
about this is this so hard?

1086
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:36,080
So I mean it is what it is.
We don't have to do the failed episode.

1087
00:58:36,081 --> 00:58:38,150
What we planned is not anYmore

1088
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,223
anyway.
They said they got so many people that 

1089
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:43,950
were like,
fuck you,

1090
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:47,730
I want net neutrality that their website
crashed.

1091
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:50,490
And they were like see how bad we want 
net neutrality.

1092
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,413
And the fcc was like,
actually you guys have greatly 

1093
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:57,443
exaggerated how many people have come 
because the reason our website got shut 

1094
00:59:01,651 --> 00:59:02,484
down is because we were hacked and ddoss
attacked by people trying to make it 

1095
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:11,190
look like there was more people than 
there were.

1096
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:12,503
So they just made a bright light because
these such a little fucking bitch look 

1097
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:18,534
at the house.

1098
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,800
Like how

1099
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:22,943
does,
is there a whole team that has to agree 

1100
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,330
on that statement?
Yes ma'am.

1101
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:27,620
And they all agreed.

1102
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,473
So at first came out by like their their
tech person and then ajit pi boy came 

1103
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,404
out and did a press conference in front 
of congress and said we were ddoss 

1104
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:40,744
attack.
Now everybody knows about tech was 

1105
00:59:42,221 --> 00:59:44,770
looking at it and being like,
there's no evidence.

1106
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,693
We're almost certain that didn't happen.
and he came to the point where it was 

1107
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:51,040
pretty much proven that they will never 
d dos attack.

1108
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,680
So we're,
theY're now forced to just recently,

1109
00:59:53,681 --> 00:59:54,514
August 8th to admit that they lied about
an alleged cyber attack that didn't 

1110
00:59:59,021 --> 01:00:04,021
actually ever happened because they 
looked like such idiots.

1111
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:07,183
This,
and I'm not surprised this is the guy 

1112
01:00:09,701 --> 01:00:14,701
who made those videos about net 
neutrality in his santa suit.

1113
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,533
So when do they get any kind of 
punishment for lying about it and in a 

1114
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:22,474
sane world,

1115
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:26,540
but my friend that is far from the world
we live in,

1116
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,313
but just know that this.
He got a pie in the face but it's not 

1117
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:34,480
the first and won't be the last one.
This,

1118
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:37,190
I think this guY's just use them cream 
all over his face.

1119
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,730
You know what I'm saying?
Yep.

1120
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,693
If his face got creamed anymore,
he'd looked like the chair in that 

1121
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:49,120
office.
Do you know what I'm saying?

1122
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:55,690
I know I got through that store.
What else would go film academy awards.

1123
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:02,090
New category at the academy.
What do you call those?

1124
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,230
The oscars.
What do you call those?

1125
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:07,310
Yeah,
the oscars new category at the oscars.

1126
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,343
Outstanding achievement and popular film
because all the popular films never get 

1127
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:17,690
nominated because it's all this art 
bullshit that nobody's fucking watched.

1128
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,400
By the way.
I kind of agree like the shape of water.

1129
01:01:21,401 --> 01:01:23,350
Who cared about that movie?
I don't understand.

1130
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,873
Yeah,

1131
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:28,580
I know.
The one before was one day before it was

1132
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:30,540
like moonlight,
which was like the super like,

1133
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,360
I know it's 10 people saw that.
I haven't seen that one,

1134
01:01:33,361 --> 01:01:34,194
so I can't tell,
but I saw when I was traveling to 

1135
01:01:36,721 --> 01:01:38,640
Israel,
I got to watch a bunch of movies,

1136
01:01:38,641 --> 01:01:41,190
so I saw the shape of water and I was 
like,

1137
01:01:41,191 --> 01:01:42,360
what?
Who cares?

1138
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:44,460
Got the movie.
She fucks a fish.

1139
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:47,190
She falls in love with him for no 
reason.

1140
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,070
It's like the.
The storY was so weird.

1141
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:51,503
I haven't seen it,
but isla has a really good thing going 

1142
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:53,613
on.
Like,

1143
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:55,620
how's it going?
Let me get this straight.

1144
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:56,963
It's a chick flick.
It's about the power of love when a 

1145
01:01:59,551 --> 01:02:00,750
bitch can be.
Sorry,

1146
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,750
I shouldn't say it like that.
I should've framed like that when a girl

1147
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:05,300
I didn't make a bit.
not a bit.

1148
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,640
She's like,
yeAh,

1149
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:08,790
I just mean that in like the colloquial 
sense,

1150
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:09,624
but I shouldn't say that.

1151
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,050
So when a sweet young,
lovely,

1152
01:02:14,051 --> 01:02:15,880
misunderstood.
Yeah.

1153
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,230
Because she can't talk.
She's so misunderstood.

1154
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,710
She's mute.
That true love can still find you in end

1155
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:23,563
and the form of a giant fish cock.
It looks like a fish monster or 

1156
01:02:29,131 --> 01:02:30,090
whatever.
Tell me.

1157
01:02:30,091 --> 01:02:32,940
Does she actually fuck them?
They actually have sex.

1158
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,313
Ahab biologically caPable of having sex 
and she does it in an aPartment that is 

1159
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:41,370
not hers.
She fills up Then.

1160
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:43,320
I mean,
I don't know if this is like your family

1161
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:46,770
is going to get upset for me spoiling 
the shooting movie,

1162
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,170
but nobody cares.
Um,

1163
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,620
she fills up the bathroom with water 
boiler that they fuck.

1164
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:53,813
I don't know.
I mean I knew about it before I watched 

1165
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:56,910
the movie,
so I don't think so.

1166
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,810
everyone has talked about it already and
if there's a sexual act,

1167
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:03,270
do they do with the gills?
no,

1168
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:04,104
he,
she,

1169
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,200
they acknowledged that he has like an.

1170
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,400
Yeah,
they went out.

1171
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:09,690
Did they ever acknowledge it?
How Big it is?

1172
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:10,603
No,
but she fills up the bathroom with the 

1173
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:18,390
water so that they can swim together.
The Bathroom?

1174
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:19,224
Yeah.
She fills up the room with a water hose 

1175
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,280
possible.
Not possible.

1176
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,710
And then you need to do movie reviews.
This is great.

1177
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,860
Then the water is leaking?
Well,

1178
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,510
no,
the whole Building.

1179
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,850
So let me get this straight.
Somehow.

1180
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:33,684
She's a hero.
She didn't care about everyone else in 

1181
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:36,444
the building.
Celebrated when she destroys this whole 

1182
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,113
bill floods,
this whole building so she can get a 

1183
01:03:42,121 --> 01:03:45,110
little selfish dick because she's so 
pathetic and lonely.

1184
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:47,360
She can't go over to the corner bar to 
the dive.

1185
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:51,000
I get some dick the normal way.
Yes.

1186
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,680
And we're giving her academy award.

1187
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:56,760
Isla,
you need to do movie reviews.

1188
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:59,280
You're such a hater,
like in a great way.

1189
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:03,960
Did we need holy shit.
So anyway.

1190
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,013
Outstanding achievement in popular film.
It's kind of a slap in the face though 

1191
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,650
too.
It's Like it's not a real category.

1192
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:19,070
It's like fast and furious.
Is the winter fast and furious.

1193
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:25,140
Twenty one is the winner and outstanding
achievement and popular film.

1194
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,980
Everyone stands up and claps.
So like fake ass award.

1195
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,610
They've been.
They've been given examples.

1196
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:35,640
Movies like the guardians of the galaxy 
and the star wars films.

1197
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:38,430
We've been nominated for both in this 
new category and best picture.

1198
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:39,413
However,
the intent of this category is to honor 

1199
01:04:40,351 --> 01:04:43,650
more popular blockbuster type movies a 
lot.

1200
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:46,680
The avengers or star wars.
I mean,

1201
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:47,514
look,
if you can't make a gooD movie that's 

1202
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:51,840
popular,
both like lord of the rings one,

1203
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,510
I'm surprised star wars doesn't win 
anything.

1204
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:55,823
Well,
you remember star lord of the rings wAs 

1205
01:04:58,231 --> 01:05:00,510
like sweePing every year because guess 
what?

1206
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:04,880
It's Popular and good.
Yeah,

1207
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,960
lots popular.
Can good.

1208
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,430
Makes it the best.

1209
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,393
And that's when you,
when this new categories fucking 

1210
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:15,414
everything up,
because no longer can you like popular 

1211
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:20,710
and good,
god forbid,

1212
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:21,693
and you know what it is,
it enables hollywood to be even more 

1213
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:24,214
shits.
That's true because they're gonna be 

1214
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:26,540
like,
whoa,

1215
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:31,570
well we'll win this shitty nominee.
Biggest fucking waste of time or biggest

1216
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,263
like they also enabling them.
They also are going to make the award 

1217
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:39,664
show shorter because they acknowledged 
that it's boring and no one is watching 

1218
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:48,390
down to a mere three hours from.
For me,

1219
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,253
I'm an hour and a half in this podcast 
and I'm dying expecting to walk your 

1220
01:05:51,941 --> 01:05:55,870
fucking show for three goddamned our 
other Washington.

1221
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,480
I'd rather watch her have sex with her 
fish for three hours.

1222
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,670
He's like a fish.
God fish god.

1223
01:06:03,671 --> 01:06:04,504
He's probably.
But they never explained why they never 

1224
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:09,860
show like what's so good about him,
his fucking car.

1225
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:17,810
they explicitly referred to him as a 
godless being what it is that god.

1226
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:18,653
Yeah,
he's a fish.

1227
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:21,760
Got there.
Like what makes him a god?

1228
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:23,940
They're like 15 inches.
It's just so like,

1229
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:28,310
typically there's like this evil man,
which is one of whom are no reason,

1230
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:29,163
no reason,
and then she's the only one who sees to 

1231
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,493
butte in him stupid.
It's got to be a button for this 

1232
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:40,530
destroyed.
There's no context.

1233
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,960
And then we did the bit to Alex Jones 
saying the edit.

1234
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:44,813
yeah,
we did.

1235
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:49,620
I could do a movie review.
I hate being late.

1236
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:50,583
I hate 90 percent of all movies.
I don't know if it's a new segment for 

1237
01:06:53,671 --> 01:06:58,671
the h three videos that you live movie 
reviews so and say,

1238
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:02,043
well let's start on the podcast.
I've embarrassed and it's kind of like 

1239
01:07:03,911 --> 01:07:06,220
the,
the segment that I hate on jimmy kimmel,

1240
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,470
except that you're actually coherent 
having an opinion.

1241
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,580
He's just doing nonsense.
Yeah,

1242
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,420
yeah,
yeah,

1243
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,870
yeah.
I mean he just ran some incoherently and

1244
01:07:13,871 --> 01:07:17,470
it's just because he has an accent.
You're like a glorious hater.

1245
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:20,800
Like you are dismantling this dumb ass 
video.

1246
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,580
Like that's a beautiful thing.

1247
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:27,610
I'll think about it.
I,

1248
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:29,680
I anyWay,
but you know,

1249
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:33,340
you guys judge for yourself,
but I do fear that like,

1250
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:36,370
but you guys are going to hate me 
because I hate movies.

1251
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:37,204
Do you like probably so good though,
but you can't hate it because you're so 

1252
01:07:39,941 --> 01:07:41,740
lovable.
All right.

1253
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:44,260
what else?
We got amazon glasses.

1254
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,940
My throat is actually hurting for like 
10 hours.

1255
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:55,940
Amazon is patented some goggles and by 
the you know,

1256
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:58,360
yada yada yada.
The workers,

1257
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:00,940
they were.
it's augmented reality so they work more

1258
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:02,463
effectively.
Here's a picture they look like ski 

1259
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:06,003
goggles and their warehouses so big that
they need to create goggles that gives 

1260
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:13,270
you.
It's like a gps.

1261
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,890
It tells you turn left turn right

1262
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,033
to get the product.
Speculate that this tech is actually 

1263
01:08:21,021 --> 01:08:21,854
being used to train deep learning ai so 
that they can eventually throw out all 

1264
01:08:27,501 --> 01:08:32,501
these fucking loser as humans and just 
have robots doing it.

1265
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:37,690
Interesting.
What's next?

1266
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,300
We're so fuck when there's no jobs left.
you know what I'm saying?

1267
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:45,933
Anyway,
I don't really believe in that because 

1268
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:51,310
there will be new jobs.
Can you know there is a problem.

1269
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:56,580
I mean like historically it's like 
people don't ride horses anymore,

1270
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:02,980
so,
but then a new youtube videos.

1271
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:03,851
Yeah.
Well,

1272
01:09:03,851 --> 01:09:05,460
how many people can youtube higher?
No,

1273
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:07,450
but I mean there's new jobs.
I know,

1274
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,313
but it's like before,
but it's shrinking because automation 

1275
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:15,400
automation was ever a problem with 
shifting fields.

1276
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:16,511
It was like,
oh,

1277
01:09:16,511 --> 01:09:17,344
we don't need people to raise horses,
but now we're building cars and it's a 

1278
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:23,710
new field or like you don't need people 
digging coal up,

1279
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,720
but now there's all these people on 
renewable energy.

1280
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:26,733
Exactly.
But automation is a different issue 

1281
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:35,450
because it's literally replacing people 
of every job.

1282
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:39,803
Yeah.

1283
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,313
And so all because you got to order your
cute tips in one day shipping from 

1284
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:51,830
amazon instead of walking into a roth 
five minutes away from your house.

1285
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:55,760
Did you know?
We're guilty of that every date.

1286
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:58,910
What else?
We got ian,

1287
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,950
you want to do this presentation for 
christ sake?

1288
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,133
Little uzi.
Here's another ian put together a 

1289
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:07,220
segment for us.
Lil uzi vert,

1290
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:12,230
who's a hip hop rapper.
you raps.

1291
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,440
He,
um,

1292
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,800
he ripped off or let's not say ripped 
off.

1293
01:10:18,801 --> 01:10:23,210
He got inspired by the art of heaven's 
gate cult.

1294
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:28,810
If you guys don't remember these sweet,
very inspired and creative individuals.

1295
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:29,923
the heaven's gate cult.
They were the guys you guys may recall 

1296
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,333
when haley bop came around,
which is this comment that comes around 

1297
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,290
earth about every 2000 years or so.
Dan,

1298
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:40,790
is that correct me if I'm wrong,
approximately.

1299
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:41,863
Yeah,
that's right.

1300
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,003
And um,
hail bottom hale bob sounds like such a 

1301
01:10:46,131 --> 01:10:46,600
great news.

1302
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,530
I kind of already with haley bop,
bop.

1303
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:50,750
Anyway,
these dudes,

1304
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:52,581
they act,
you know,

1305
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:55,010
drinking the koolaid.
But these are the guys,

1306
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,270
they,
that's their main.

1307
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:57,613
Their,
they originally there the original 

1308
01:10:58,611 --> 01:10:59,301
correlate drink?
No,

1309
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:02,650
they were a applesauce aisle.
No.

1310
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:05,180
Are you sure it is a johnstone 
different,

1311
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,410
different goal.
God,

1312
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,250
can we retake this?
What did they do in that?

1313
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:12,840
Both sides put poison sinai.
Well,

1314
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,880
there night they had these sweet ass 
nike's,

1315
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:16,400
right?
I did hear about the nike's.

1316
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:18,270
Yes.
So they all were wearing,

1317
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,620
looking like,
so fresh,

1318
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:21,390
like ultimate sneaker heads of these 
guys.

1319
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,120
And they had these fresh.
Yes,

1320
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:26,310
nike's on.
And um,

1321
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:29,010
they ate this apple sauce with poison in
it.

1322
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:34,190
And they all said,
smell you later or and in there,

1323
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:38,400
they believe that hailey bop,
bop,

1324
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:39,840
bop,
whatever.

1325
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,840
Fucking haley.
Bob haley.

1326
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:44,940
Bob is bob.
What is it,

1327
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:45,630
dan?

1328
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:48,780
I believe it's hale bob hale.
Bob.

1329
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,000
We'd pee.
We hit that.

1330
01:11:51,001 --> 01:11:52,440
Be hard at the end.
Or is it a piece?

1331
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:57,750
Are we pronounced hale bopp for fact 
checking this right now,

1332
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:59,800
bob.
We got the kids.

1333
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,380
Yeah,
kidding.

1334
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,210
By the expert.
You can get him in there.

1335
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:04,044
So hale bopp not yet.
Hale bopp comes around every 2000 years 

1336
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:09,750
and they thought there's an alien 
spaceship.

1337
01:12:09,751 --> 01:12:12,120
The mothership that cruises behind the 
comment.

1338
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,580
And if they kill themselves when it's 
close to the earth,

1339
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:16,920
they go up to the spectrum.
I didn't know why they are.

1340
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:19,500
Why are they so eager to get on that 
spaceship in?

1341
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,980
We'll be able to answer that for us.
What's going on on that spaceship that's

1342
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:25,230
so dope.
Parties.

1343
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,310
I love that.
They were all like,

1344
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,280
we've determined that this nike is the 
freshest.

1345
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:31,223
We want to bring these,
but I wonder if today would be easiest 

1346
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,673
or what.

1347
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,360
No,
they're like,

1348
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:39,720
these yeezys are the fresh issue for 
eternity.

1349
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:41,873
It's too hard to get.
So what is some guys are going to be 

1350
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:47,400
hard it to get 10 years.
These are you kidding me?

1351
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:48,923
Anyway.
Um,

1352
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,050
so they died and,
but,

1353
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:52,943
and so anyway,
there's two of them that they left 

1354
01:12:55,081 --> 01:12:58,230
behind to maintain the website,
which is hilarious in its own right.

1355
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:03,650
So here is um,
their original art here.

1356
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,350
Heaven's gate,
which is pretty sick honestly.

1357
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,613
What does it say?
As was promised the keys to heaven's 

1358
01:13:10,831 --> 01:13:14,610
gate are here again in that font is kind
of tricky.

1359
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,133
And to and do the u of o two as they 
were in jesus and his father 2000 years 

1360
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:23,430
ago.
Oh,

1361
01:13:23,431 --> 01:13:25,110
I guess there are theories that it 
passed.

1362
01:13:25,111 --> 01:13:27,510
Last time it passed was when jesus was 
alive.

1363
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:28,793
So he jumped on up to the spaceship.
What kind of dumb ass plot is that of 

1364
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:33,270
jesus?

1365
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:34,103
To be like,
yo,

1366
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:39,660
I came to this planet to create life and
die for all your sins.

1367
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:40,703
But guess what?
My spaceship only comes around every 

1368
01:13:42,841 --> 01:13:45,270
2000 years you're going to be wearing 
now.

1369
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:50,310
Can't be wearing the freshest shoes to 
know jesus was the ultimate sneakerhead.

1370
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,990
I love that.
Graphic design is insane.

1371
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,660
And like the gate looks like a key so I 
don't.

1372
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,420
It's so good.
So,

1373
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:04,570
and his new album art was here.
I'll show you obviously like,

1374
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,050
I don't know if you want to call it a 
parody,

1375
01:14:07,051 --> 01:14:12,051
but obviously really heavily inspired by
it and frankly it's so sick there.

1376
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:16,480
is this better?
Yeah,

1377
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,880
there's was like ultimate freshness as 
was promised.

1378
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:19,714
The keys to eternal outtake are here and
love and rage the ufo to as little use 

1379
01:14:26,181 --> 01:14:28,400
vert and his father 2000 years ago.
Anyway,

1380
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:30,170
I love iT.
I think it's great what he did.

1381
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:35,870
But guess who didn't?
Heaven's gate who removed by the way,

1382
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:36,704
I probably have a chip on their shoulder
because all their fucking homies or 

1383
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:39,803
cruise a ufo with jesus.
I've been a crazy party with these like 

1384
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:47,000
crazy sneakerhead party.
So there,

1385
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:49,340
there you got a chip on their shoulder 
and franklin and blame them.

1386
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:52,160
So they're threAtened to sue a little 
uzi vert.

1387
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:54,110
And,
um,

1388
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:55,760
that kInd of leaves us off

1389
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,550
worth ian,
who as you know,

1390
01:14:59,551 --> 01:15:00,384
is the keeper of culture and knowledge 
here to report on the huge drama that 

1391
01:15:06,431 --> 01:15:07,264
has been sending shockwaves throughout 
the hip hop community and the earth at 

1392
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:12,890
large.
Um,

1393
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:18,130
he's even been in touch with their 
surviving to cult members.

1394
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:22,420
He's been in contact.
He has communications with them.

1395
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,470
So with that being said in,
please,

1396
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:27,683
you're actually,
I think you were supposed to come in 

1397
01:15:28,661 --> 01:15:32,110
already if I'm being frank with you.
Hit him with the stinger.

1398
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,010
Oh,
you're waiting for me.

1399
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:34,070
Alrighty.

1400
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:34,930
Okay.

1401
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,790
Okay.
So,

1402
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:46,210
um,
as you guys are setting that up,

1403
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:49,390
kind of kind of botched the timing a 
little bit.

1404
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:54,940
God,
jesus christ.

1405
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:57,430
Oh,
what happened?

1406
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,250
You have an excuse.
What do we think about?

1407
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:00,283
What happened?
Are you blaming daddy's faded out and 

1408
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,540
spit it out.
What's on your mind?

1409
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,190
there's clearly something on your mind 
that you're wanting to say.

1410
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:11,470
So if you have an excuse for what's for 
this,

1411
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,890
tell me what's on your mind.
What's on my mind is heaven's gate.

1412
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:16,150
All right,
you're going to Play it.

1413
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:17,080
Cool.
That's fine.

1414
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:18,760
But this was good at,
you know,

1415
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:19,693
burning the time.

1416
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,110
Okay.
All right.

1417
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,580
Well,
so here we go.

1418
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:28,773
So ian has put together and his classic 
form a powerpoint presentation once 

1419
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:36,124
again is the keeper of culture and 
knowledge we've been loved and 

1420
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:39,813
powerpoints should we love very much,
which is the intersection doesn't cross 

1421
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:43,114
very frequently.
The powerpoint and the keeper of color 

1422
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,593
and youth culture.
He is putting in power often not 

1423
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,043
crisscrossing.
I want to bring powerpoints into the 

1424
01:16:52,121 --> 01:16:54,230
mainstream a little more.
I'm glad to hear that.

1425
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:57,100
A great format.
So with that being said in,

1426
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:01,000
please lead us on a bizarre journey into
outer space and beyond.

1427
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:01,963
Okay.
Thank you.

1428
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:03,281
Uh,
aliens.

1429
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:06,420
Colton,
hip hop and investigation by the intern.

1430
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:08,650
That is me.
Uh,

1431
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,220
you kind of prefaced a lot

1432
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,150
of it,
you know,

1433
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,120
but I had a little backstory with lil 
uzi vert,

1434
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:18,500
grammy nominated wrapper six times 
platinum.

1435
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:23,501
Hit single xo tour life a cultist duly 
no.

1436
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,600
All this is the question that I'm 
seeking the answer.

1437
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,420
Thank you.
Yeah.

1438
01:17:32,421 --> 01:17:34,680
I had to pay extra for the emoji pack,
you know,

1439
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,500
for the powerpoint.
No,

1440
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:37,160
no,
no.

1441
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,750
How to png.
And what's that anymore?

1442
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:43,760
Uh,
so on July 6th,

1443
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:44,653
this is where it all started.
Lil uzi vert changes his instagram 

1444
01:17:46,881 --> 01:17:51,881
profile picture to the following the 
leader.

1445
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,113
This is,
yeah.

1446
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:58,450
This squidward squidward looking fella.
Look at that face and tell me that too.

1447
01:17:58,611 --> 01:18:01,940
It is not a spaceship with jesus,
right?

1448
01:18:01,941 --> 01:18:04,580
The f now that guys will colyer.
Yeah.

1449
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,990
He's a guy.
Could get Behind.

1450
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:06,824
I think also an interesting note.
Who's these only following one person 

1451
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:13,450
and it's a marilyn manson.
Just dramatic.

1452
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:14,930
Yeah,
it's interesting.

1453
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:16,670
So that's what kicked it off.

1454
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:20,180
And then on july 30,
first he releases his album,

1455
01:18:20,181 --> 01:18:21,014
cover the one you mentioned there.
And Then on August 1st he tweets the 

1456
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,380
following.
Uh,

1457
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:31,310
I never really worry because I will 
definitely transfer to another body.

1458
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:32,203
Please come with me.
I'm part of the new movement of which 

1459
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:39,340
those are some ideas from heaven's gate.
So do you.

1460
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,510
Okay.
I'm interested.

1461
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:45,500
I didn't know that he was actually.
Yeah,

1462
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:46,334
he did.
He get the memo because that comment 

1463
01:18:47,271 --> 01:18:48,104
doesn't come around for bet.
Well that's what I asked them about as 

1464
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:52,270
well.
Let's not get,

1465
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,420
I mean,
I'm gonna let you do your thing.

1466
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:56,030
I'm captivated though.
It is interesting.

1467
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:59,780
Lucy wants to ride the mothership 
because he didn't just grab the graphic.

1468
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:01,190
He's actually saying,
you know,

1469
01:19:01,191 --> 01:19:04,220
like transferring to another body or 
some of their beliefs.

1470
01:19:04,221 --> 01:19:05,990
So,
uh,

1471
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:06,913
what all this mean.
So All this mean what all this means we 

1472
01:19:11,961 --> 01:19:12,794
need to know.

1473
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,080
So there's them side by side.
Uh,

1474
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,740
the bottoms there,
like,

1475
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,800
uh,
here again in 10 doe,

1476
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:26,600
those were the names of the two leaders.
Doe was the squidward looking man.

1477
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:29,390
OkaY.
She passed away and then he kinda went a

1478
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:33,110
little loopy.
That was his wife or significant other.

1479
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,800
They were the cult leaders together.
He believes like it says,

1480
01:19:36,801 --> 01:19:41,801
as they were in jesus 2000 years ago,
he believes that he is jesus.

1481
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:45,260
That guy's jesus.
Yeah.

1482
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:49,220
And he's trying to get back to god.
not like he was actually him,

1483
01:19:49,221 --> 01:19:53,870
but he's been possessed by an alien 
spirit that also possessed jesus.

1484
01:19:53,871 --> 01:19:55,820
Two thousand years ago.
Oh damn.

1485
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:59,930
So jesus was possessed by an alien,
found people,

1486
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:04,100
took them up and then came back 2000 
years later.

1487
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,720
Wow.
And grabbed a couple more.

1488
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:08,670
so that's,
that's the belief system there.

1489
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:13,320
I got to say design wise that ge really 
nestled into that queue whole way better

1490
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:14,154
than that.

1491
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:15,643
It definitely does.
Someone pointed out to me as well that 

1492
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:22,560
the green bay packers kind of stole the 
logo to the g.

1493
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:23,910
It's like the same,
gee,

1494
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:28,830
these guys are prolific designer.
Like this design is kind of next level.

1495
01:20:28,831 --> 01:20:30,100
Insane.
No,

1496
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,770
it's great bringing me up,
man.

1497
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:33,300
Yeah.
Also like the,

1498
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:38,160
I have to say the curvature of the earth
is really accurate.

1499
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:39,953
Yeah.
That's powerful curve curvature of a 

1500
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:44,880
huge planet earth.
But it loosely on there.

1501
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:46,320
Then he went a little too much 
curvature.

1502
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:50,360
Yeah.
It's more of like a table class.

1503
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,270
So this is the guy marshall applewhite.
Applewhite.

1504
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:57,060
Yeah.
Interesting.

1505
01:20:57,061 --> 01:21:00,270
Because then he had them all killed 
themselves with apple sauce.

1506
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:04,440
I thought it was inspired with a fun 
little easter egg.

1507
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:06,270
So here's a clip of him.

1508
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:12,050
Your only chance to evAcuate is to leave
with us.

1509
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,460
It looks like you've been drink lots of 
water,

1510
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,570
Planet earth,
acid with a about to be recycled.

1511
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,430
Your only chance to.
He doesn't blink,

1512
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,770
blink,
survive.

1513
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:30,150
Graduate is to lead.
He recorded these taPes

1514
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:34,830
kind of as a way to get people on board 
and up to speed.

1515
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,540
Oh,
this is a recruitment technique.

1516
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,190
Well,
yeah.

1517
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,570
So yeah,
in march of 1997,

1518
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,940
38,
members of the heaven's gate call eight,

1519
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:49,941
poison applesauce killed themselves and 
to board the comment and uh,

1520
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:55,110
they all put on identical outfits and 
matching nike decades before the deed.

1521
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:56,790
So I Have a picture of that in this next
one.

1522
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:02,410
A fresh or they have a little patch.
Oh yeah.

1523
01:22:02,761 --> 01:22:06,120
They designed that patch as well and 
they all had it on their shoulders,

1524
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:09,210
sec,
uh,

1525
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,133
the nike's or discontinued and 
incredibly rare few pairs on ebay 

1526
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:14,370
regarding,
for around $800.

1527
01:22:14,371 --> 01:22:17,430
Right now it's pretty ordinary.
The shoe,

1528
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:23,990
the shoe itself isn't that nice?
But yeah,

1529
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:27,660
it's interesting how that's appealing.
But uh,

1530
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:28,643
yeah,
the remaining members are threatening 

1531
01:22:29,521 --> 01:22:31,140
legal action.
Now.

1532
01:22:31,141 --> 01:22:32,150
Hold on,
I'm in.

1533
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:33,203
I'm fascinated by the fact that some of 
these guys were left behind apple juice 

1534
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,083
or not to chug that.

1535
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:40,110
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah,

1536
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,320
yeah.
They're left behind specifically to do a

1537
01:22:43,321 --> 01:22:45,480
cup just to maintain the website.
Yeah,

1538
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:47,610
I asked them about that.
Uh,

1539
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:48,870
am I getting ahead of myself?
Do you have.

1540
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:50,160
you have.
We're good.

1541
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:51,960
All right.
So this is their website,

1542
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:56,961
like as it looks today,
it hasn't changed since 1997 motif.

1543
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,630
Yeah.
they really stuck with it.

1544
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:02,963
So I was just saying,
I spoke with remaining member to get 

1545
01:23:04,891 --> 01:23:09,891
some clarification.
So my first thing I said,

1546
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:12,730
how do you heard of [inaudible] before?
What do you think of his music?

1547
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,310
Who designed the original logo is pretty
high catching.

1548
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:16,950
They said,
uh,

1549
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,840
we did not hear of him before the 31st.
Very sPecific.

1550
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:22,323
We know nothing of his music.
It was designed by a couple members of 

1551
01:23:24,761 --> 01:23:26,350
the group in the spring of [inaudible] 
96.

1552
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:29,090
So a year before they all said,
yeah,

1553
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,033
I'll took off.

1554
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:35,110
This is not the first time musician has 
cooperated heaven's gate,

1555
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:39,820
uh,
in 2016 frank ocean use the same imagery

1556
01:23:39,821 --> 01:23:40,654
for his song nike's.
So here's a picture from his music 

1557
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:44,590
video.
Uh,

1558
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:47,720
and I was like,
what do you think of people using it?

1559
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:50,520
and you can see the,
uh,

1560
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,640
the bed there and the nike shoes.
That's that picture.

1561
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:55,961
Yeah.
Oh,

1562
01:23:55,961 --> 01:23:57,430
what they're going to come on,
dude.

1563
01:23:57,690 --> 01:23:59,440
I was just curious to attribute.
Yeah.

1564
01:23:59,441 --> 01:24:00,940
So I said,
yeah.

1565
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:01,893
Do you find it upsetting or are you glad
to see that heaven's gate is impacting 

1566
01:24:04,671 --> 01:24:07,450
and popular culture?
What is the appeal?

1567
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,510
Really good questions.
I was getting curious.

1568
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:11,344
They sent me a whole a,
they understand that it's pervaded the 

1569
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:15,334
culture,
but frank ocean was not infringing on 

1570
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:18,640
logos so,
so they're not upset,

1571
01:24:18,650 --> 01:24:23,280
but guys are like very business oriented
business,

1572
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,090
very business.
They don't mess around.

1573
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,010
Can we just acknowledge this is kind of 
insane?

1574
01:24:27,011 --> 01:24:28,470
That means having a conversation.
yeah.

1575
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:30,391
Yeah.
It was.

1576
01:24:30,391 --> 01:24:33,490
Where did he touch with them?
They have you can reach out.

1577
01:24:33,491 --> 01:24:37,780
That's all they do is answer emails.
that's damn one of their main thing.

1578
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,393
They dOn't have a job.
They do.

1579
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:41,860
I don't say what.
No.

1580
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,520
I have an idea of what it may be,
but they didn't explicitly say,

1581
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,130
what's your idea?
Does that later can't waIt?

1582
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:51,310
So they told me that they weren't 
bothered by that.

1583
01:24:51,311 --> 01:24:53,470
They know that their information is 
controversial.

1584
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:54,483
Artists reflect the social discussion.
Many are interested in the inner 

1585
01:24:57,490 --> 01:25:02,410
information and that the generation z 
group wants to learn more and are not as

1586
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:04,870
put off as others have been over 21 
years.

1587
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:06,093
We're not here to waste our time.
Eventually they want to see the planet 

1588
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:13,810
and breakthrough with their information.
We're not here to harm mankind.

1589
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:16,300
We are here to educate and inform.
so,

1590
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:20,290
uh,
I said you were mentioning that you were

1591
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:21,124
hoping to see the planet.
I've come to understand that the next 

1592
01:25:23,951 --> 01:25:24,784
level,
that's kind of what they call heaven is 

1593
01:25:26,051 --> 01:25:29,560
only accessible every 2000 or so years 
with the passing of the comment.

1594
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:30,843
is that the only way to get there,
it's estimated to return in the year 

1595
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:37,150
4,380.
What are your plans for the next 2000,

1596
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:40,040
362 years?
Uh,

1597
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:41,143
are you,
are you planning on just spraying the 

1598
01:25:42,251 --> 01:25:43,084
teachings throughout the next two 
millennium is by way of reincarnation 

1599
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:48,480
because they believe in reincarnation.
They kind sassed me a little bit here.

1600
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:49,323
Really?
Where did you get the idea that we time 

1601
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:54,790
ourselves to space debris,
so hold on,

1602
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:57,930
wait,
the comment of space debris that.

1603
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:01,690
yeah,
apparently the comment isn't the ufo.

1604
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,880
The ufo is behind it in like a jet 
stream,

1605
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:06,043
but he's saying that the ufo can come 
around anytime he says the next level 

1606
01:26:10,971 --> 01:26:15,110
created this universe and can come and 
go whenever and wherever they choose.

1607
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:19,250
We don't know when they will return but 
will be less than 900 or so years.

1608
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:24,280
So there'll be so not worried.
So they just click $900 where they.

1609
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,980
What did you get the eye?
I love some space debris.

1610
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:30,380
Yeah,
simple mortal.

1611
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:33,530
The other.
I was a dumb ass for thinking this a.

1612
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:36,170
I love that they say we don't know when 
it will return,

1613
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,100
but it will be within 900 years.
Yeah,

1614
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:39,610
no worries.
Yeah.

1615
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,230
Yeah.
Nathan fielder would just be like,

1616
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:43,523
okay.

1617
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,070
I said when the members left for the 
next level,

1618
01:26:49,071 --> 01:26:52,400
what was the conversation like in which 
you were instructed to stay behind?

1619
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:53,593
How maNy were asked to stay?
Did you feel reluctance or possibly 

1620
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:57,090
relief?
Whoa,

1621
01:26:57,330 --> 01:26:58,490
whoa.
I'm curious.

1622
01:26:58,491 --> 01:27:00,740
And they said there were no 
conversations.

1623
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:04,880
We received our instructional,
all the group departed by 6:00

1624
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,190
PM on March 24th.
There were no options.

1625
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:09,340
Just instruction.
Sounds kinda east.

1626
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:11,570
There's some baggage there.
Yeah,

1627
01:27:11,571 --> 01:27:13,400
they didn't really.
They just kind of said,

1628
01:27:13,401 --> 01:27:14,234
okay,
this is what we're told and we'll have 

1629
01:27:14,991 --> 01:27:16,690
to do it.
But this guy,

1630
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:17,613
there's some real.
Do you think there's some underneath 

1631
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:21,213
just like we're just loyal soldiers and 
we just got an instruction and follow 

1632
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:26,121
it.
yeah.

1633
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:30,110
But like you can tell there's some 
resentment there.

1634
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:31,423
You think.
I mean if the 39 people are going to 

1635
01:27:33,321 --> 01:27:36,260
like this space paradise,
there has to be and,

1636
01:27:36,261 --> 01:27:39,140
but we need you to stay behind and duke 
just like,

1637
01:27:39,141 --> 01:27:40,160
fuck you.

1638
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:43,250
Like they're all doing their thing,
you know what I'm saying?

1639
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,530
He's,
he's worshiping the next level.

1640
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:48,290
Yeah.
We need somebody To.

1641
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:51,320
Somebody asked me to stay the night 
extra to maintain the website.

1642
01:27:51,321 --> 01:27:53,600
I'm upset.
Imagine 900 years.

1643
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,113
Yeah.
But who's going to watch like lil uzi 

1644
01:27:56,811 --> 01:27:57,644
vert and see what he's up to us.
How many were left behind and how will 

1645
01:28:01,911 --> 01:28:04,260
you reach the next level?
Uh,

1646
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:08,120
they said eight were left behind,
five have died of natural causes,

1647
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:10,700
but completed their tasks in 1997,
98.

1648
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:14,090
We two are left in Arizona and one is in
los angeles.

1649
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:15,673
Uh,
we will rejoin them in a classroom 

1650
01:28:17,481 --> 01:28:22,310
situation at some point in time through 
carnation classroom situation.

1651
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,650
What does that mean?
I have no idea.

1652
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:30,320
We will reincarnate and rejoined them at
classroom situation.

1653
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:33,080
Yeah.
So I'll just chill in class.

1654
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:36,420
Breakfast clubs,
shredder mess.

1655
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:40,930
Yeah.
So I don't know what the classroom.

1656
01:28:40,931 --> 01:28:43,780
And I love this guy.
How this is kind of an old guy.

1657
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,230
Must be right.
It's a couple.

1658
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:46,460
Um,
the,

1659
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:48,230
the,
the couple that live in Arizona,

1660
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:52,220
I think I'm jumping from one to the 
other in these responses.

1661
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,860
Oh yeah.
they must be on the older side,

1662
01:28:54,861 --> 01:28:59,861
like sixties maybe because the cold,
the cold started around the seventies.

1663
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:04,440
So theY speak kind of like old people.
Yeah,

1664
01:29:04,690 --> 01:29:06,420
exactly.
Michelle emojis.

1665
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:08,303
I asked him,
is your primary directive to manage the 

1666
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:13,410
website and answer inquiries?
Do you have other duties?

1667
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:16,860
I was reading some of the guidelines for
the group and they're really restrictive

1668
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:19,680
down to like they were instructing how 
big your pancakes could be.

1669
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:21,323
A just for dietary purposes,
do you have hobbies outside of heaven's 

1670
01:29:24,631 --> 01:29:25,810
gate?
Maybe your favorite movie,

1671
01:29:25,811 --> 01:29:26,644
your favorite album?
I was hoping that they'd given me 

1672
01:29:28,771 --> 01:29:30,510
something.
Yeah.

1673
01:29:30,511 --> 01:29:33,180
or like we love like nacho libra or 
something,

1674
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:36,630
but uh,
some did internet stuff,

1675
01:29:36,631 --> 01:29:37,464
media coverage.
One was assigned to production tasks 

1676
01:29:39,121 --> 01:29:43,530
with filmmakers that didn't work out.
I actually found that story.

1677
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:45,183
There was a producer to make the film 
and he went on tv and was talking about 

1678
01:29:49,021 --> 01:29:49,854
it and he was on probation for a auto 
theft and they saw him on television in 

1679
01:29:55,411 --> 01:29:57,960
California with the coal and immediately
went and arrested him.

1680
01:29:58,840 --> 01:29:59,840
That's where it fell through.

1681
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:02,963
So we worked fulltime,
still pay for everything and take care 

1682
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:07,260
of the group affairs all the other 
times.

1683
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,670
So no hobbies?
No.

1684
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:11,580
Any of the dutIes of providing 
information,

1685
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:15,690
just very focused on their beloved.
The how forthcoming they are though.

1686
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:18,780
They just did whatever you want,
man.

1687
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:21,000
You got to ask.
Uh,

1688
01:30:21,001 --> 01:30:22,710
so.
And they got back to you pretty quick,

1689
01:30:22,711 --> 01:30:23,544
right?
What is this?

1690
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,100
Yeah,
they're very faster responding.

1691
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:30,720
So I found that when they w before 
everyone went on the spaceship,

1692
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:31,883
they,
the way they made money was actually a 

1693
01:30:33,301 --> 01:30:34,134
lot of them were programmers and so this
was their old website called higher 

1694
01:30:37,801 --> 01:30:42,000
source that they would have a use to get
programming jobs.

1695
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:45,810
And This is on the way back machine in 
1997.

1696
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:46,703
I don't think it's there anymore.
So I just looked at what type of 

1697
01:30:48,691 --> 01:30:49,524
websites they designed.
And if you go on their website design 

1698
01:30:51,751 --> 01:30:53,820
tab,
here's the list of stuff they've done.

1699
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:57,930
I clicked on one of them.
This is prima donna.

1700
01:30:58,950 --> 01:30:59,783
They designed this website for a 
unauthorized madonna cd was not a thing 

1701
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:09,120
on it.
It's madonna,

1702
01:31:09,121 --> 01:31:09,954
but it's like a bootleg and someone 
hired them to sell this bootleg cd and 

1703
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:17,940
this pretty awesome website here.
So that's how they got their money.

1704
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:19,163
Uh,
it's interesting looking at all these 

1705
01:31:20,191 --> 01:31:21,024
old websites.
I'm wondering sitting on like a small 

1706
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:27,760
fortune from these madonna bootlegs.
I'm sure it was a big business and still

1707
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:30,600
working a job.
Somebody's got to bay hosting bill.

1708
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:32,910
They are working day jobs.
Right.

1709
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:37,170
So I read about the website design.
Were you one of the designers?

1710
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:40,680
Have you ever considered updating the 
website to make it a little more modern?

1711
01:31:40,681 --> 01:31:45,681
I could give you an offer code with 
squarespace and uh,

1712
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:48,323
they weren't on the design team,
so they aren't still designing right 

1713
01:31:50,641 --> 01:31:50,880
now.

1714
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,680
So I know they said no,
thank you.

1715
01:31:52,681 --> 01:31:55,860
The website is to remain as it was in 
march 97.

1716
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:59,140
Really promoting our sponsors.
I've wanted to throw that in.

1717
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:04,180
I looked like they could use it if I 
wAnted to reach the next level.

1718
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:07,660
What are the main stePs I should take?
Predators destroying the power cable.

1719
01:32:07,661 --> 01:32:08,494
By the way,
I read that the next levels and actual 

1720
01:32:13,121 --> 01:32:13,954
planet.
Is there an actual hell to like must've 

1721
01:32:16,151 --> 01:32:18,790
far in the outer rim.
That's where a,

1722
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:23,680
is that a reference?
I'm not getting cut off mannequins arms,

1723
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:27,370
uh,
the next levels across universe.

1724
01:32:27,371 --> 01:32:29,620
There are no steps that can be taken in 
this era.

1725
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:31,780
So if you want to go now you're kind of 
out of luck.

1726
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:33,743
Um,
you're ranked number seven on watch 

1727
01:32:35,231 --> 01:32:38,230
mojo's list of top 10.
What do you think of that?

1728
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,500
I thought that was funny.
They still answering.

1729
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:43,841
Uh,
I mean,

1730
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:45,670
I figured that's kind of an honor,
right?

1731
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:51,180
We don't think watch mojo means that 
much load on shots at one time.

1732
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:53,780
Yep.
Yeah.

1733
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:58,000
WhaT is the biggest misconception you 
believe people have when it comes to the

1734
01:32:58,001 --> 01:33:00,970
group at the members were weak minded,
gullible,

1735
01:33:00,971 --> 01:33:03,430
and brainwashed.
Just the opposite is true.

1736
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:05,043
Uh,
I read that the group purchased alien 

1737
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:10,750
abduction insurance from a uk based 
insurance provider prior to march.

1738
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:11,584
Twenty.
Fourth is,

1739
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:15,880
is this true?
This is like a rumor floating around and

1740
01:33:15,881 --> 01:33:19,300
it's on their wikipedia that they bought
alien abduction insurance.

1741
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,530
Uh,
there's actually a company in,

1742
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:26,640
in the best business ever to be in.
How much does it cost for alien?

1743
01:33:26,981 --> 01:33:29,560
And there's a.
Anyone listening right now,

1744
01:33:29,561 --> 01:33:32,110
if you want aliens,
parents email me,

1745
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,513
I'll assure you.
There's a company in the uk and geico 

1746
01:33:35,651 --> 01:33:39,730
has a report on it that they've sold 
over 30,000

1747
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,540
insurance policies that is the best.

1748
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:48,490
They said that they looked into it but 
didn't buy it.

1749
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,353
The internet turned a humorous inquiry 
by us into a weird insurance event that 

1750
01:33:52,271 --> 01:33:54,400
never happened.
It was blown way out of proportion.

1751
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:58,360
So they just goofed.
So this is,

1752
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,570
uh,
I.

1753
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:02,890
This is pretty,
in a short way.

1754
01:34:02,891 --> 01:34:03,724
I asked if lil uzi vert could help carry
the torch and spread the word if he's 

1755
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:11,080
open to learning with this new movement.
He mentioned or does he not have what it

1756
01:34:11,081 --> 01:34:12,610
takes?
They go,

1757
01:34:12,611 --> 01:34:16,180
lil uzi vert would have to make a 
dramatic change in his grasp of what the

1758
01:34:16,181 --> 01:34:17,014
next level is really like.
It would fizzle so they don't trust him 

1759
01:34:20,231 --> 01:34:23,620
to carry on the legacy at a concert 
recently,

1760
01:34:23,621 --> 01:34:26,590
this freaked everyone out where he said,
you guys are basically old friend.

1761
01:34:26,910 --> 01:34:28,390
I know.
We feel like you're like one.

1762
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:33,340
I feel like ian's going to show up 
covered in a blanket with some nike's on

1763
01:34:33,341 --> 01:34:34,174
and a couple of weeks after,
I don't know if I'm going to stop 

1764
01:34:37,271 --> 01:34:40,060
talking to suck then I know I'm saying 
I'm concerned.

1765
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:43,570
I've started to rethink some things.
I may need to get some insurance.

1766
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:47,230
I got you,
but were you at a concert recently?

1767
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,800
Uzi vert kind of freaked out his fans 
because he said you,

1768
01:34:50,801 --> 01:34:52,650
uh,
you all have entered the rapture.

1769
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:54,730
No one's flying up to heaven.
Obviously.

1770
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:57,100
All of you are going to hell ride with 
me.

1771
01:34:57,470 --> 01:35:00,170
You're already here.
So sorry you can't get out.

1772
01:35:00,171 --> 01:35:01,460
You're stuck.
It's over.

1773
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:04,520
You heard the songs a million times.
You didn't even know.

1774
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,540
So he's saying that his songs are like a
gateway to getting people to go to hell.

1775
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:10,970
That's pretty bow thing to say to your 
fans.

1776
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:12,343
And that was just like what?
His fans got kind of freaked out by 

1777
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:17,020
expecting like the ground to like open 
up from that minute.

1778
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:21,800
I asked what did they think it is?
If you say lil uzi vert fast enough,

1779
01:35:21,801 --> 01:35:24,740
it sounds like lucifer,
lil uzi vert lucifer.

1780
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,520
And uh,
I,

1781
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:28,373
uh,
they said he does not know the ways of 

1782
01:35:29,601 --> 01:35:32,090
the next level.
Everything he talkS about has nothing to

1783
01:35:32,091 --> 01:35:32,924
do with us.
He has to comply with copyright law and 

1784
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:37,980
what's with little uzi?
Is he really like?

1785
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:41,660
He's just doing an act.
Okay.

1786
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:44,660
Yeah.
I think for the it splitting,

1787
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:47,750
this is a picture that's on,
on his facebook,

1788
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:52,310
his official facebook is a advert 
starting a luciferian space.

1789
01:35:52,311 --> 01:35:53,144
Colt and dragging his fans to hell is 
kind of the question that looks pretty 

1790
01:35:55,911 --> 01:35:57,020
serious.
That panic.

1791
01:35:57,021 --> 01:36:00,770
I don't know if that's official painting
on a.

1792
01:36:00,830 --> 01:36:03,050
Nicki minaj released a song this 
morning.

1793
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:07,760
One of the lyrics was like,
when I told uzi to go to hell,

1794
01:36:07,761 --> 01:36:10,160
I didn't mean it literally.
And uh,

1795
01:36:10,161 --> 01:36:13,550
that's,
that's today has representatives did not

1796
01:36:13,551 --> 01:36:16,830
respond to requests for comment.
I reached out to uzis,

1797
01:36:16,831 --> 01:36:17,664
uh,
people.

1798
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:19,850
Yeah.
Is a little easier ever.

1799
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:21,950
PlanninG on starting a space.
Colt uzi,

1800
01:36:21,951 --> 01:36:24,410
vert demon.
Should I be scared of ms.dot.

1801
01:36:24,450 --> 01:36:25,283
You're credible.
You're increase luck in they didn't 

1802
01:36:29,271 --> 01:36:30,104
answer and I have no.
I have no idea why they wouldn't answer 

1803
01:36:33,861 --> 01:36:37,130
us.
Disreputable hd pacas no to us.

1804
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:41,930
Ian,
since insane on.

1805
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:43,593
So the moral of the story really after 
all this is beware of rappers offering 

1806
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:48,050
you applesauce.
You know,

1807
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:49,500
it may be poisoned.
Sure.

1808
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:51,590
Don't get sucked in.
Just don't eat applesauce.

1809
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:53,523
Be safe.
Avoid applesauce all together because 

1810
01:36:54,981 --> 01:36:57,860
what are you.
If you're over the age of a year.

1811
01:36:58,910 --> 01:36:59,743
Yeah.
A watch out for guys that looked like 

1812
01:37:01,161 --> 01:37:01,994
this.
This is a photo taken from their 

1813
01:37:03,621 --> 01:37:04,454
websites on the landing page,
how a member of the kingdom of heaven 

1814
01:37:07,191 --> 01:37:08,024
might appear.
So if you see a guy dealt fast tracks 

1815
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:15,050
Who hop on like some adidas.
Yeah.

1816
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:17,750
Everything about sneaker heads,
they're all very fashionable.

1817
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:20,480
So if you see that guy walked around,
you know,

1818
01:37:20,481 --> 01:37:23,720
look out and get some abduction 
insurance really cut.

1819
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:25,670
And that's uh,
that's the end.

1820
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:28,910
So that's what we learned.
Give me some applause.

1821
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,930
That was another great presentation to 
intern.

1822
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:35,980
Tom,
before I

1823
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:38,450
send you out,
tell me about your.

1824
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:43,370
How was the reporting that I was talking
with the members of this infamous colt?

1825
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:46,040
I mean,
did you feel a lord?

1826
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:49,340
Cause they had some kind of a business 
like charm.

1827
01:37:49,341 --> 01:37:51,950
I'll say,
did you feel like you wanted to hang out

1828
01:37:51,951 --> 01:37:52,970
with that?
Tell me,

1829
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:55,640
did you learn anything?
Yeah,

1830
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:56,730
I.
Well,

1831
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:58,290
at first I was like,
oh god,

1832
01:37:58,291 --> 01:37:59,124
are these people gonna be weird and 
freaky and try and find out what like 

1833
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,570
scientology will kind of comfort.
These guys have kind of been like,

1834
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,780
we're good.
We got 900 years To chill out.

1835
01:38:09,781 --> 01:38:12,960
So they're not very urgent.
You're pretty relaxed.

1836
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:15,840
Just don't mess with their copyrights.
Most definitely.

1837
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:16,943
Well apparently they are not suing.
They're threatening to sue their 

1838
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:21,970
threatening and now he seems like he may
be changing the keys back in.

1839
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:26,340
Oh wow.
So it's an interesting story.

1840
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,990
ThAt's a shame.
All right,
