00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:18,280
world,
Christina p Thompson.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,443

7
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,550

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,120
Christine's be online.com
and Thompson also touring.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,053
Yes sir.
At Thomson [inaudible] dot com slash 

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,830
tour.
Thank you for saying it correctly.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,860
Well Hey,
it is two or fewer.

13
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:43,930
I like to get out some of the east coast
people.

14
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:47,080
They see a tournament.
Yeah,

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,520
and I'm always like a different word 
that's wrong.

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,810
They say tournament tournament.
They say yeah,

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,050
like keep me up to be one of those 
people.

18
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:56,884
I have friends from philly that go like,
you're going to stay for the tournament 

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,170
and I'm like the tournament and I don't 
know.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,290
It's a real problem.
I feel like that's not the right word.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,840
I think it's completely wrong to say it 
like that.

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,733
Am I missing?
But the spelling I guess could lead you 

23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,081
to be like,
yeah,

24
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:12,430
it's tour.
No men.

25
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,310
So how do you say it?
Tour?

26
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,130
No,
no,

27
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,120
I'm saying I'm talking about it turned 
to tournaments to say tournament.

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,770
You don't say tournament.
No,

29
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:23,260
that's insane.
That's a bad.

30
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,630
And we're back and we're back.
Thank you guys so much for being here.

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,740
Happy.
No,

32
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:33,910
not November to both of you here.
I'm fucking backed up.

33
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,230
He backed up.
I am.

34
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,520
Do you don't know about?
No,

35
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,443
no,
not November.

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,573
I'm assuming.
I've seen sounded some rumblings on the 

37
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,410
Internet for sure,
but I mean after.

38
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,450
So you can say whatever the heck you 
want after sober October though.

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,870
No Jazz November.
It's not happening,

40
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,990
but I haven't just this whole month.

41
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,190
You haven't June.
Not on purpose.

42
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,030
Yeah,
pretty much.

43
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:58,863
You'll go,
you'll go a seven days in a month 

44
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:02,540
without even trying to think,
well,

45
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,690
here's why you were traveling and I 
guess sick.

46
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,110
You don't care if I don't and none of 
those things inhibit me.

47
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,123
Okay.
I jerk.

48
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,320
I jerked it maybe the first or second,
but now,

49
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,030
I mean now it's like five days of built.
It's backed up.

50
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,023
You could feel an ache.
I'm kind of feeling empty and when 

51
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:23,980
they're full you mean by the.
By the load side of the,

52
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,810
the girth of the testes.
The,

53
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,040
Hey,
are you serious?

54
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,440
Will agree with you.
She's pretty good at it.

55
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,870
I didn't.
I didn't even know that about myself,

56
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:35,770
that the shill got a store somewhere.
I'll lean over and be like,

57
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:36,910
let me slide it in.
And she'd be like,

58
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:39,070
hold on.
She'll do like an exam.

59
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,660
She's like,
Oh yeah,

60
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,410
oh,
it's been woo,

61
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,383
this is dangerous.
But one of the glues going to come out 

62
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,100
like it's been.
Oh my goodness,

63
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:52,000
that's graphic,
but I feel like I'm kind of short.

64
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,020
I'm feeling kind of aggressive today and
she'll also pick up on that.

65
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:58,870
She'll be like,
you're that upset about it.

66
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,960
That's amazing.
Yeah.

67
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,230
Really honed in on each other's a load 
sizes in behavior.

68
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:07,900
That's amazing.
You've been together for 14 years,

69
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,240
so when he's 10 years officially married
tomorrow.

70
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,730
Oh my goodness.
That's wonderful.

71
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,790
Well,
you guys are truly excellent.

72
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,240
Amazing.
One of the great couples on the planet,

73
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,350
so I'm very,
like I said,

74
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,510
we could work something out though.
For what?

75
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:24,850
For getting this thing out tomorrow.
Sure.

76
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,320
We'll see.
You can masturbate.

77
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,820
Yeah,
but then it ruins.

78
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:29,510
It ruins what,
Babe?

79
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,050
The font of of you being like.
That's so much.

80
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,150
Oh,
can I be honest?

81
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,670
Be honest right here.
Now.

82
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,780
I don't think I've gone more.
Oh my God.

83
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,210
I'm trying to honestly think this guy 
really jerks at.

84
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,393
That's where he's going to tell me.
I don't think I've gone more than a day 

85
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:50,440
without accumulating maybe since I was 
like a day.

86
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,480
Don't look at me.
I mean,

87
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,450
I don't know,
maybe a couple of days,

88
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,970
but you.
For me it's like,

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,990
you know,
there's this great.

90
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,160
You guys have seen the Seinfeld about 
the competence.

91
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,640
Kramer has this great line that has 
resonated with me since I heard it.

92
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,500
She says masturbating.
No,

93
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,770
that has red.
I think about it every day.

94
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,450
He goes,
Elaine wants to join the competition,

95
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,400
and they say that's not fair.
She says,

96
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:18,920
well,
you know,

97
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,980
masterminds like shaving your legs.
And she says,

98
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,690
I shaved my shaving.
She says,

99
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:24,910
I shaved my legs and Kramer says not 
every day.

100
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,013
That's right.
Right,

101
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,333
right,
right.

102
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,860
Well that's true.
Now let me ask you something though,

103
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,910
because I'm assuming you guys aren't 
getting it in every day.

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,710
Marital loves.
So are you.

105
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,930
Where do you.
Where are you doing your thing?

106
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,170
Is it the shower bathroom?
Well,

107
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:42,850
not where you're going to notice me.
That.

108
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,160
No,
I don't keep it a secret then something.

109
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,780
Have you been caught?
Have ever been caught?

110
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,070
Actually,
no.

111
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,440
I cannot wait to catch him.
I've never been called.

112
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,550
I think I was caught once by my vehicle 
was under the blanket.

113
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,013
It was more embarrassing than dramatic,
but either will never catch me 

114
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:04,800
masturbating.
Why is that?

115
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,910
Why you buy this?
I don't.

116
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,360
This is the bed detective.
Do you?

117
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,460
Are you trying to walk in now?
The detective's going to come out though

118
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,290
now.
I'm not safe.

119
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,713
You're going to be like in the middle.
We're going to be really close and 

120
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,500
you're held me back.
And then just to see her face like Linda

121
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,810
through a door can be in the reflection 
of the monitor watching porn.

122
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:34,963
But you don't care.
You can go a week without even thinking 

123
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:37,810
about it.
Uh,

124
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,640
no.
I mean I think about it a lot,

125
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,590
but sometimes I'll go like,
here's the thing to men,

126
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,370
we got two kids.
One's a real little one.

127
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:47,830
Yeah.
So like your sleep and,

128
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,260
and you know when you have a busy 
schedule,

129
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,840
like we know we were all doing a lot of 
things.

130
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,490
Yeah.
Sometimes it's like,

131
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:56,240
it's literally,
oh my God,

132
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:58,220
I just got to bed and I'm so tired.

133
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,330
Sometimes it'll be like,
oh,

134
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,550
it's morning.
I could do it right now.

135
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,750
And I will,
um,

136
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,200
or night in the shower,
shower.

137
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,213
And then.
But I'm saying sometimes like that I'll 

138
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,860
be like a,
is this going to be a good one?

139
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,480
Or you don't mean.
Because there's ones who were like,

140
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,310
that was a disappointing one at this 
point.

141
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,700
They're all disappointing for me.
How has it discipline?

142
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:20,720
There's disappointing.
That's where you're just like,

143
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,640
ah man.
That was just,

144
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:23,510
it got.
I mean,

145
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,100
he's just got some of the food through 
the system,

146
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,710
but it's not like it.
You know what I mean?

147
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,381
This,
that.

148
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:30,110
Let me put it this way.
It's just like stale chip.

149
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,170
You jerk off and it's just like.
And then you're like,

150
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:34,880
all right,
there's no,

151
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,310
there's almost no pleasure.
Like compulsive.

152
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,810
Yeah.
That's interesting.

153
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm really backed up,
right?

154
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,740
Yeah,
I hear Ya.

155
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,780
Tomorrow we'll do it.
Oh Wow.

156
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,220
Well here you go.
Ah,

157
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,280
yeah.
We have to understand sober October kind

158
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:53,810
of ruined that month too because he was 
exercising six hours a day.

159
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:55,580
That really fucked me up,
man.

160
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,360
I worked out for almost 4,000
minutes,

161
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,970
which whatever.
That adds up to a lot of minute.

162
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,893
Yeah.
Because it gives you a little recap on 

163
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,963
that through the APP and I swear to you 
were a lot of times we're doing two a 

164
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,864
days like working out in the morning and
then in the afternoon or evening and I 

165
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:12,944
would,
I would fall asleep like into the 

166
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,110
deepest slumbered,
which is nice.

167
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,153
It was nice.
Yeah.

168
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,560
Yeah.
But I didn't have the.

169
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,313
No,
nothing.

170
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,260
Should we tell him what happened?
Remember,

171
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,950
remember,
right towards the end of October,

172
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:29,300
October.
I don't know,

173
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:31,230
it's just fucking sad.
We went all right.

174
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,143
We went to make marital love and I had 
full body cramps and had to stop old 

175
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,050
body crap dude.
Like arms hands.

176
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,190
And I was like,
I didn't even tell you this.

177
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,010
I felt some of those cramps before I 
stopped.

178
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:49,641
I was like,
fuck it,

179
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:50,690
ignore it.
Don't,

180
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,613
don't stop and go stop.
And then when it was to the point where 

181
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:56,150
like,
I felt like I was gonna fully collapsed.

182
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:56,984
His wife said something.
I have never experienced the whole body 

183
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,570
cramps.
I mean what I'm saying,

184
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:04,090
I had a,
you know,

185
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,920
I've had calf cramp arm,
um,

186
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,550
chat like these were all at once.
That was so dehydrated,

187
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,850
you know,
how was do it seems so intense.

188
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:17,590
Do you enjoy it?
Do a mean with the sober.

189
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,270
I enjoy fitness aspect of it seems so 
intense.

190
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,010
It was intense.
I did enjoy it.

191
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:23,960
I think it's fun to compete with 
friends.

192
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,720
Like it's fun to go like,
Ethan,

193
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,220
I bet I can do this.
I will be.

194
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,670
You Go,
well if you go like I can do it too,

195
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:35,140
and then like we really are and then I'm
checking on you and you're checking on.

196
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,103
That part's fun.
I think if I was just competing with 

197
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,410
like people on the Internet,
I'd be like,

198
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,303
I dunno.
Yeah,

199
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,800
yeah.
What was.

200
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,280
Was there any noticeable effects for 
view gloss?

201
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:45,114
Wait,
are you feeling.

202
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,820
How is.
I mean you haven't even.

203
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,850
I feel like I'll tell you why it ruins 
our home life was like where's dad?

204
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:56,160
Just hiking for eight hours at a like 
our son

205
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,993
is crying one day.
Are you seeing fell behind and I bowl 

206
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:03,690
rigs out and shit like that.
And you're like,

207
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,070
what?
Why are we doing this again?

208
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,470
You're all over 40.
Well I'm middle aged in the forties.

209
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,590
It feels good actually.
I'm buying online.

210
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,680
Can we celebrate Ms Dot Sheila though?
And your pregnancy.

211
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,810
I'm dying to talk to you about this.
Have you talked about this a lot on this

212
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,410
show?
But yeah,

213
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,960
there's a lot to say.
I'm sure about it.

214
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,390
We're doing a little updates,
like we had an ultra,

215
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,760
our first ultrasound last week.
That's a cool.

216
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,550
It like a little,
little,

217
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,490
little,
a gummy bear with a heartbeat.

218
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,343
Heartbeat when they do the ultrasound,
I remember I remember separate times 

219
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,610
than the lady being like,
do you want to hear the heartbeat?

220
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,750
Like who goes now?
You're saying it's there.

221
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,310
All right.
And then you're like,

222
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:53,971
yeah,
of course.

223
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:55,640
And then they're going to do.
You're like,

224
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,320
who doesn't want to hear that?
Like,

225
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,333
okay,
they should be concerned if you set off 

226
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:01,284
a notification.

227
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,360
It's such a cool moment.
So you're feeling great.

228
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,580
Yeah.
I'm not nauseous at all.

229
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,381
I guess.
Weird.

230
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:12,000
Everyone is like,
oh.

231
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,403
But I,
we've talked about how I've never puked 

232
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,980
in my life and in your life.
Never even felt the uh,

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,730
almost puke.
Like if you ever almost puked.

234
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,713
I've had this like when you're little,
when you're looking for something or 

235
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,283
come up.
Well there's been times I that even 

236
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,010
possible.
You mean like indigestion?

237
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,500
Not the same.
You don't,

238
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:37,334
you don't even know you.
She so doesn't even understand what 

239
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:42,420
puking it.
I remember once we were at a party,

240
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:44,160
she over drank and she was feeling 
nauseous.

241
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:44,994
It's about to Alice,
shoving my fingers down her throat and 

242
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:50,770
she couldn't have a gag reflex.
Maybe.

243
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,910
I don't think she does know.
But you've never ever done it with booze

244
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:57,630
and it came up in voluntarily?

245
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,470
No,
I like,

246
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:03,360
I blacked out a few times from alcohol,
but I would still not dangerous.

247
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
But regardless,
it's serving you well.

248
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,220
And because,
uh,

249
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:11,670
I got to say it,
there was this funny moment where before

250
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,830
we knew she was pregnant and she was 
like,

251
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:14,570
God,
this,

252
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,730
this pizza's so good.
Started eating food,

253
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:18,840
enjoying food,
or we're like,

254
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:19,674
what the hell is going on here?
And then like a couple days later I 

255
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,000
found out she was pregnant.
That's when I tell you,

256
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,540
after I gave birth to our second son,
food just tasted like cardboard.

257
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,403
Like I lost.
That's what I'm afraid of because when 

258
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:34,224
you're,
when you're pregnant it's like you're 

259
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:37,050
hot and you just can't.
I couldn't stop eating.

260
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:41,730
I'm like enjoying food for the first 
time in a long time.

261
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,680
I don't know,
like,

262
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,070
I don't want it to sound depressing,
but I'm enjoying food click rate.

263
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,003
Yeah.
I guess like when you're high and what 

264
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,740
are you eating the most of?
What do you crave?

265
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,240
I was just telling you I don't crave 
meat,

266
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,530
right?
I don't.

267
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,360
I can't normally like Meta or.
No,

268
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,210
no,
but I'm like this is more than usual.

269
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,470
More kind of aversion because usually 
it's the opposite.

270
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:13,471
Women get aversion to like salads when 
you're hot trimester because parents,

271
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,270
because your show,
there's no note.

272
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,950
They're going to be the cutest little 
parents.

273
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:23,320
You're going to be the band or the 
sweetest fucking bitch.

274
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,183
I swear to God like I've been having 
like a midlife crisis and you guys walk 

275
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,630
away from that edge.
You know what I mean?

276
00:12:29,631 --> 00:12:30,464
Like,
and you guys are all so supportive in 

277
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,960
the sweetest God damn people.
I love just being around you guys.

278
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,823
I've been excited about this podcast 
because you guys are so sweet and 

279
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:40,084
calming and like you've got,
you've got like you've got your shit 

280
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:45,460
together and you're so nice and you like
us.

281
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,293
It seems like what we're talking about.
We've been trying to schedule more 

282
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:53,200
dinners and yeah,
it's fun.

283
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:56,200
I was sick the last time.
I'm still coughing.

284
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,420
I regretted I was a great regret.
No,

285
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:01,150
no.
I think actually when,

286
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,270
when you got.
I think I was getting sick too.

287
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,900
Yeah,
I got sick also.

288
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,753
I got,
I got antibiotics and it was a whole 

289
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:10,200
thing.
I didn't go there.

290
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,270
Are you going to do a natural birth at 
the house?

291
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:15,640
Are you going to rent like a tub at the 
house?

292
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,950
The house live of the podcast.
Oh,

293
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:22,750
you don't know this?
Uh,

294
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,613
Jews aren't more on wait.
Is that a Catholic Christian fucking 

295
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,800
Weirdos out there who were absolutely.
Wait,

296
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,810
why the Christian thing?
It's a happy thing.

297
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,971
It's weird.
Why?

298
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:38,860
Tell me what you're talking about.
So there are lunatics.

299
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,900
They're usually white.
They usually white.

300
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:41,500
It's white people.

301
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,500
It's white hippie Vegan types.
They'll have home births and they'll get

302
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:48,244
like a tub and put it in the living room
and then give birth in a tub and just 

303
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,383
not have any epidural or any pain meds.
You know that your reaction is exactly 

304
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,940
what the reaction should be.
Healthy.

305
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:01,660
React and do people come and walk?
They have parties.

306
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,840
Every party.
Absolutely.

307
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:07,030
What do you expect that water.
It looks like in the bath,

308
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:10,690
it's so hot.
I'll take a sip at the end.

309
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,583
I would jump into those papers,
ceremonies that the dad then gets into 

310
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,300
Jackson.
He jerks,

311
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,310
right.
It's huge load load for one delivery.

312
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,540
Oh Wow.
That sounds.

313
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,440
Yeah,
I'm into that.

314
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,810
But yeah.
So you know Kat,

315
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,130
Kat von d tattoo artist.
She's like a famous tattoo artist.

316
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:33,964
Anyway,
she's praying right now and she puts on 

317
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:40,111
instagram and she's going to have a home
birth and no vaccinations.

318
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,303
Vaccinations on the kid and she's been.
So she's eating Vegan through pregnancy 

319
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,621
and look,
hey,

320
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:46,360
that's all more power.
That's your choice.

321
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:51,510
But she just gets lit up like honestly,
you guys going to vaccinate

322
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,420
or how stupid thing is that?
Um,

323
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,600
when I was born I don't think I had 
autism,

324
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:03,560
but now I'm pretty sure that I do.
So I haven't seen any.

325
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,513
So I think no vaccines,
whatever the vaccine is for to prevent 

326
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:10,790
autism.
You don't want that.

327
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,610
I want.
Oh yeah,

328
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,760
she was,
she's got a lot of views.

329
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,860
She has.
She's very popular,

330
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,510
very popular.
I really liked her actually.

331
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:23,510
She was on that show,
las forever and Miami ink.

332
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,670
Um,
but she just gets lit up,

333
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,943
you know,
you kind of asked for it when you're 

334
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,210
home.
Birth is,

335
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:31,010
uh,
is this something relevant here,

336
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,020
Dan?
A nut?

337
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,150
She's talking about the home birthing 
brought my husband and I closer,

338
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:36,500
Yada Yada,
Yada.

339
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,340
Sisterhood,
brotherhood.

340
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,660
Naturally I've become more empathetic.
Can you scroll down,

341
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:44,360
Dan?
Is there any relevant a part here?

342
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,160
Oh yeah.
Because the captions,

343
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:51,161
pretty bunch of hub bub vaccine kids 
idiot vaccine.

344
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,290
Your kids idiot.
Yeah.

345
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,060
Yeah.
Well,

346
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,330
I do think that [inaudible] is pretty 
insane.

347
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,970
I mean,
it's so insane.

348
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,010
What are,
who are these people?

349
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:05,390
Where are they,
where are these people?

350
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:07,750
There's a lot of conspiracy theory.
I mean that a lot of people,

351
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,040
like they'll realize that,
you know,

352
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,113
the American medical journals have 
debunked that entertained for a while 

353
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:19,480
and then I actually did a valid study on
it and yeah.

354
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,473
You know,
why are we not all walking around with 

355
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:24,430
autism?
Why are we all not great?

356
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,363
I mean,
we're all,

357
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,920
we're all vaccinated and smallpox has 
gone,

358
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:31,160
but I mean,
well I guess we are a little autistic.

359
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:31,640
I mean,
look,

360
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,473
look at what's going on here.
I think I might have something to do 

361
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:38,180
with new jacket every day.
Every day.

362
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,253
Really.
Are you going to leave clues relate to 

363
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:44,020
find what's the little nut trail now?

364
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,260
The detective's gonna catch you man.
Sometimes I wish I jerked off less,

365
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,890
but I can't just know.
Part of your thing,

366
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,843
it's just your daily downside.
Do I do have concern that it is a 

367
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:57,830
compulsive behavior?
That might be true.

368
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,160
Let me ask you this because there was a 
comic who I won't sell out,

369
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,270
but a comic told me that we were going 
to do a show and he was like,

370
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,390
yeah,
you know,

371
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,223
I,
I jerk off like in the hotel before 

372
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,700
shows and I was like,
oh my God,

373
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,270
I would not do that at all because it 
would make me too tired.

374
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,583
I was like,
I don't want to feel tired to go do the 

375
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:17,960
show.
The opposite.

376
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:21,140
I would like to.
I would do it after a show,

377
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:26,060
like get back to the room and easy and 
then Romance,

378
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,760
oh,
I like to spend time with me.

379
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,520
No,
but does it not?

380
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,000
Can you do it?
And then like,

381
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,900
are you the type that it kind of knocks 
you out or you're like,

382
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:36,950
oh,
I can just go out.

383
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,823
It depends,
you know,

384
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,170
I found that jerking off in the morning 
is generally a bad idea really,

385
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,223
because it'll,
it could slow your day down so much 

386
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,420
because once you jerk off,
like you're going to be on your phone,

387
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,450
if you had like a big event,
like I don't know you,

388
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:50,070
you had to.
No,

389
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,430
no,
no.

390
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,680
I won't do it right before.
No Way.

391
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,733
Yeah,
that's what I was.

392
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,740
No Way skype performs jerker generally.
I'm a night jack.

393
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,870
He was keeping notes.
Aren't you guys together?

394
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,670
I assume you're watching your shows at 
night.

395
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,890
You're married.
I guess I fall asleep first book.

396
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,960
There's not.
Look,

397
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,900
it happens you.
This is something that just happens.

398
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,711
And,
and uh,

399
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:13,540
you know,
my clothes were.

400
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,260
When are you sneaking off?
Are you of these guys to do?

401
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,570
You pull up the Samsung and this turned 
into an acquisition.

402
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,190
Yeah,
I generally,

403
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:23,911
yes.
The phone.

404
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:24,744
Yeah.
I'll use the phone.

405
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,913
Do you ever do that thing?
I've done this where like you kind of 

406
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:31,440
pay attention to how deeply she's 
sleeping and you're like,

407
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,370
I think I can do it right here.
Yeah,

408
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,580
yeah,
yeah,

409
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,423
for sure.
You are so sick and then you have 

410
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,330
masturbated in the bed when Tom was 
sleeping.

411
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,940
No.
Have you don't think so.

412
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,180
You have.
Yeah.

413
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,750
There's no shame.
Yeah.

414
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,230
No,
I get so embarrassed.

415
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,064
Look at me.
I'm fucked.

416
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,533
I'm telling everybody about my 
compulsive masturbating jerking off one 

417
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:02,130
time in the bed when you guys are,
you're not afraid of being caught.

418
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:05,190
I think the fear of being caught so 
thrill though,

419
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:06,480
right?
Not For me.

420
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:07,760
I don't like being afraid.
No.

421
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,013
I'm not afraid of being caught in that.
I'm so confident that I'm not going to 

422
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:15,264
be caught here,
like asking for me to find I know what 

423
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:18,264
I'm doing.
She doesn't want to catch me know too 

424
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,720
because I noticed that like I,
you know,

425
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,080
my morning shower is not usually.
Not usually not.

426
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,210
Sometimes I do,
but you always go like,

427
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,930
is it cool to come in,
you know,

428
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,843
what the fuck you're doing in there,
and I've a couple of times I've been 

429
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:36,300
choking my chicken and you came in but 
you were like a wreck.

430
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,913
Yeah.
But I was able to position myself kind 

431
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,490
of like hey baby was also enough steam,
you know,

432
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,000
so I was like,
what's the thing?

433
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,930
We moved to a new house recently and the
bathroom,

434
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:49,764
I don't have any privacy there because 
it's connected with the bedroom and so 

435
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:53,244
I'm really afraid to go for the shower 
these days because if you walk in it's 

436
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:59,730
going to be so obvious that I'm like 
concealing my toner.

437
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,130
You guys have a new game though.
This can be a fun game.

438
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,413
You'll continually jerk off every day.
You know what altered off and you could 

439
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:10,890
be watching tv if that's cool with you.
It's not gonna Bother.

440
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,350
No,
I don't think we're a little strange.

441
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,620
Like if you're watching like a 90 day 
fiance and I'm just beating off.

442
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,790
Is that a problem?
While we were watching?

443
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,100
No,
that would be weird.

444
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,950
Yeah.
You can't just get up and kitting,

445
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,580
like taking a dump.
You can't just get up and take it down.

446
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,330
90 Day fiance you watched that?
We started to.

447
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:32,850
And then we forgot about it.
Dude.

448
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:33,750
What's the.
Okay,

449
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:34,980
what is the,
uh,

450
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,123
the video you parody?
Like what'd you make fun of the 

451
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:38,740
reaction?
Yeah.

452
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:40,900
So you're talking about our new video.
Yeah,

453
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:44,730
I loved it.
It was a plc pilot for ICAT.

454
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:47,010
Fished my kid.
That's so weird.

455
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,030
Which is funny because.

456
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:53,030
And they roasted the day especially for 
being such a fucking Weirdo.

457
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,070
This is such a great show.
It never got picked up.

458
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,850
It's funny because he of all people drew
the line somehow.

459
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,140
Speaker roster is nothing but like obese
people,

460
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,940
small people.
John even had one that like,

461
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:14,010
I'm a fat black dwarf.
They follow people that have

462
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,580
nothing inherently interesting about 
them.

463
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,660
Other than that they look unusual.
Yeah.

464
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,223
Like I love it.
I could watch that channel was nonstop 

465
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,823
do them.
When I'm bored I go straight to TLC and 

466
00:21:26,391 --> 00:21:29,720
I'll tell you I got sucked in.
I was watching this one about my 600 lb.

467
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,730
Life been there.
Yeah.

468
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,300
And actually it surprised me because 
there was actually a lot of,

469
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,960
uh,
I'll tell you what,

470
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,860
it shocked me because I was expecting 
something really superficial,

471
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,530
but they followed this lady for like 10 
years.

472
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,900
It was pretty crazy.
I mean,

473
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:45,770
it was,
she'd make it out.

474
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:46,551
All right.
Unbelievable.

475
00:21:46,551 --> 00:21:48,290
She passed away.
Really?

476
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,050
She didn't.
Oh,

477
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,410
I don't know why I made that joke.
I think it's because he was pregnant.

478
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,880
It's like a dad joke.

479
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,980
Oh,
you were becoming a dad.

480
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,500
I'll make a joke.
Like,

481
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,383
why

482
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,340
that's a joke,
but it's like,

483
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,640
why did I just lie?
Did I tell you about my,

484
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:07,970
a Cheddar cheese addiction?
No,

485
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,020
it's pretty mild.

486
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,400
Um,
no haters.

487
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,110
What's up now?
That was a terrible.

488
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,940
I'm a fucking experience,
dad.

489
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,550
We talking about that.
You've been around the block.

490
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,800
You're setting him up so excited for you
to,

491
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,634
to be parents.

492
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,810
Do you want to say Isla?
Since she's been pregnant,

493
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:32,330
she's like,
she's like radiant.

494
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,600
She's beautiful.
She's looking good.

495
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,960
She's eating her stuff.
It's incredible.

496
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,800
I find it.
I'm,

497
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,650
I'm amazed by it.
I truly think it's amazing.

498
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,970
And I'm also simultaneously so thankful 
that I don't have to give birth.

499
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,720
And I mean genuinely.
And I'm so appreciative.

500
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,960
You've said about how you.
There's no way for you to not be kind of

501
00:22:55,961 --> 00:22:57,640
resentful.
Oh yeah.

502
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,800
Don't you hate his guts,
but you're doing all the work.

503
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,760
Like I've,
I'm,

504
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,590
I'm not even there yet,
but I'm already going to get like,

505
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,490
there's no way that those levels that 
are coming to.

506
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,963
Oh yeah.
Well here's the.

507
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,050
Here's the neat part.
Okay,

508
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:12,820
you're right,
right now you're doing all the work.

509
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,950
Nine months,
you're going to be enormous.

510
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:17,270
You're going to gain weight,
you're feet are going to grow,

511
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,070
your vision is going to get worse.
It's going to be destroyed.

512
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,620
Oh,
I look it.

513
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,410
I'm wearing glasses.
Now your vision gets worse.

514
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,870
Pregnancy,
of course,

515
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,580
pressure can lift that fluid in your 
eyes.

516
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,750
Does it get better when you worse?
So now doctor is working here.

517
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,610
This is going to be wrecked,
right?

518
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,530
And you're going to hate this fox.

519
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,770
You're a hater,
and then you're having meeting.

520
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,430
They're going to hate Tom.
That'd be great for me.

521
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,593
Here's what happens.
Here's what happens in two years time 

522
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,723
when that little boy or girl is running 
around and hyperactive and everything 

523
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,820
and you see her two year old kicked out 
and the nuts.

524
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,450
It's all.
Yeah,

525
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:57,290
because now he's getting it because now 
it's Daddy,

526
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,910
Daddy,
daddy and play Horsey,

527
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:01,670
Horsey Horsey and you get all that 
stuff.

528
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,430
So then it's awesome.
Before my reckoning comes.

529
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,960
That's right.
He'll kick in.

530
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,750
Then daddy will kick in later.
But he's a good one though.

531
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,970
There's like shit.
You can tell that.

532
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,630
Well that remains to be seen,
but I am excited.

533
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,840
Are you guys going to be Craig?
Excited?

534
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,000
What's your biggest fear but given 
birth.

535
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,163
Oh,
easy.

536
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,490
Just take drugs.
Drugs.

537
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:23,660
That's what I'm saying.
A lot of.

538
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,800
I was trying to talk.

539
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,630
I'm like,
Eh,

540
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,570
if it takes an extra couple hours and 
you don't feel pain.

541
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,570
The rest of my grades,
drugs,

542
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,080
drugs,
drugs to contractions on this last one.

543
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:37,970
And I was like,
let's go drug drug drugs.

544
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:40,310
And I didn't feel like not only do they 
get,

545
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,800
is it like mind altering drugs?
It's like an opioid,

546
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:43,634
right?
Oh No,

547
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,260
they put it in your spinal column so it 
doesn't affect the child.

548
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,310
You just don't feel it or anything.
No chill because you're like,

549
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:57,270
I'm not in pain and anguish and really 
not feel the pain of not a fucking man.

550
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,770
That's amazing.
She's a,

551
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,123
she's so scared of pain that,
that like in the months leading up to 

552
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,753
the delivery who would do checkups,
you don't need to do more and more 

553
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,424
checkups and then as you get close to 
they become weekly checkups and she 

554
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:15,830
would go like,
and what is the deal when,

555
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:19,340
when I get to the document,
I know she'll be like,

556
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:21,250
and when does the pain meds come?

557
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,520
And he's like,
whenever you want,

558
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,973
that's right,
and you're gonna fucking make sure the 

559
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:27,470
anesthesiologist is there.
And He'd be like,

560
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,600
yes.
And then it became a routine.

561
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:30,650
Like she blocked it.
He's like,

562
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,370
it'll be all set up.
We're adding smart.

563
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,263
Yeah.
And I think you're a great because you 

564
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:37,980
should take a note.
I agree.

565
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,070
Ask Your doctor because a lot of bitches
out there,

566
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:40,904
I don't know,
some warrior bitches that want to be 

567
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:42,741
like,
well,

568
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:47,700
yeah,
if you're not already had the idea.

569
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,090
I know that it wasn't dead.
Well,

570
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,590
I'll tell you what.
You're really embracing it.

571
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,424
I've gotten so terrible,
so I had the flu and I've coughed so 

572
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:04,220
much I can cough anymore.
We always hang out because I sit next to

573
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:05,054
him.
I know coffee like my ear last night it 

574
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,570
goes,
you're hurting my ear.

575
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:11,250
And I'm like,
I'm suffering.

576
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,570
What about so I cannot muster cough 
anymore.

577
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:17,660
Like my body literally cannot because 
you thought you were really sick.

578
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,090
Go to the doctor.
So it's one of these you can't cough,

579
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,500
but you've got to get the mucus out.
So disgusting.

580
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,760
Right?
So what were you saying?

581
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,653
So I'm saying you got to ask your doc 
when they're going to give you the meds 

582
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:34,310
because there are some doctors that are 
evil and won't give a woman the epidural

583
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:39,160
until she's so much dilated or whatever.
They want you to be further along before

584
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,930
because it can stop contractions and 
slow it down and keep it going.

585
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,793
They want to make sure you're 
progressing enough before they give you 

586
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:46,710
pain meds because it can slow everything
down.

587
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,640
Just make sure you get someone to 
pregnancies last.

588
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,420
Oh,
I don't know.

589
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,020
I don't know what.
I didn't know how to say that.

590
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,690
No,
no.

591
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,070
You know what you mean,
like eight,

592
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,790
17,
18 hours top to bottom.

593
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,100
That's not 17.
18 actively.

594
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:02,401
No,
no,

595
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:03,840
no.
Take of the hospital.

596
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,720
Yeah.
So first for my son came on his due date

597
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,850
and like literally I had contractions at
two in the morning.

598
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,760
We were at the hospital by what?
Four?

599
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,450
Five in the morning and then.
But then there's like,

600
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:14,940
you know,
there's long periods and dilate.

601
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:17,790
It takes hours to dilate.
They consider that you're in labor,

602
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,730
so your body active,
pushing,

603
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,550
opening.
Literally your cervix is dilating.

604
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,030
Has to get to 10 so that the head can 
come out crazy.

605
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,920
It's active labor for you as an hour and
change on the second one.

606
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,933
So then you go into where it's go time 
and if the baby's going about to come 

607
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,620
and then you can end.
By the way,

608
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:38,454
there's doctors that won't turn your 
epidural down so that you don't feel 

609
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:41,820
pain during the pushing.

610
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,073
Make sure to ask this guy.
A lot of them will be like glued 

611
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,530
epidural wore off.
No I didn't.

612
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,440
They can keep that drip going and they 
tell you to push,

613
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:50,041
you push,
push,

614
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,260
push and then bang.
I mean if you're lucky,

615
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,810
you know,
I had my tank cut twice,

616
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,560
but other than that I didn't feel it 
though.

617
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,950
You don't feel shit.
Your ass hole one hole.

618
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,153
Yeah.
You know what?

619
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,000
When that kid grows up and they're old 
enough to understand,

620
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:07,350
we need to be like,
listen,

621
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,273
if they're misbehaving,
listen you little shit in your mom's 

622
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,353
asshole.

623
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,030
I'll make them care.
I'll take picture.

624
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,810
I remember the first one.
Fuck you mom.

625
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,720
Doctor was Regina.
The doctor was like,

626
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:22,850
Oh shit.
Yeah.

627
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,410
I got a check here.
Make sure can you know.

628
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,244
She goes,
do you mind if I put my finger in your 

629
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:30,780
anus to make sure there's two holes?
I was like,

630
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,040
um,
I'd mind if you didn't.

631
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,603
She was selling and she goes,
do you mind if I put my finger in your 

632
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,080
fucking leg in there?
I don't feel anything.

633
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,440
I don't care.
I'll take a picture.

634
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:45,030
That's an a,
maybe a crazy thing,

635
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,180
but make it like super close so no one 
can tell what it is that in the bay.

636
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,500
The kids every fucking time I do,
I think they're supposed to be two holes

637
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:58,320
right there.
Yeah.

638
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,710
So are you feeling super resentful 
already of your body?

639
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:05,880
And I'm more like I'm knowing.
I know that it's coming.

640
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:11,060
Those feelings that I get,
I get little tastes of resentment.

641
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,580
I think little shadows of resentment now
it comes out a little subtle ways.

642
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,550
Like a we're just hanging in bed and 
then she just looks at me like you fuck.

643
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,300
And I'm like,
oh,

644
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,270
are you alright?
And she's like,

645
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:29,220
no,
everything's fine.

646
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,803
You know,
I already can't fit in my clothes that 

647
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:37,350
she can see the wave way out there that 
go slowly.

648
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,110
But I think see he's going to be good 
because he adores and you can tell

649
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,980
there's a lot of guys that aren't like 
he adored,

650
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:48,310
so you're going to feel the resentment,
but you're going to be able to navigate.

651
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:50,800
I feel like somehow that makes her angry
some of the times when I'm like,

652
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:53,050
you're amazing.
I can't believe you're having this baby.

653
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:54,280
It's a credit line.
She's like,

654
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,410
she's like,
fuck you.

655
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:02,210
They're like that sometimes you can't 
stop.

656
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,270
There were times too where I'm like,
I just don't know what's going on.

657
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,920
I to know what to say.
And then you figure out like that.

658
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,390
There's nothing I can say.
You just got to shut the fuck up yet.

659
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,860
That's something you learned in marriage
with them?

660
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,843
Yeah,
because it's like I said everything 

661
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:19,270
right.
I did everything right.

662
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,351
And,
and what,

663
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,370
uh,
what can I tell you?

664
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:23,920
And Isla is just like,
just leave,

665
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:28,360
just leave me alone.
Just wake up and I'm bad moon.

666
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,443
So they'll have this thing where 
sometimes I just wake up on the wrong 

667
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:33,970
side of the bed.
That's what they call it.

668
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,230
But when you get mad or irritated,
I can't,

669
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,650
I always feel like you're mad at me 
because when I,

670
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,660
when I get up to that same issue,
you know,

671
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,910
upset,
but you don't know,

672
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,360
you don't think that I'm upset at him 
and I'm like,

673
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,690
I'm not.
I think because I think we just.

674
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,750
And we experienced that feeling 
differently because when I'm upset I,

675
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,523
I treat you like my ally intentionally 
because I don't want you to feel that 

676
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:07,760
I'm mad at you.
But that's just,

677
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,610
that's very interesting.
That's just,

678
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,250
um,
psychologically that's fast.

679
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,900
But I know you're not mad at me.
So.

680
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,423
Yeah.
But I,

681
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,361
I,
I see,

682
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:17,850
I do the same thing.
What do you do?

683
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,800
So I understand what you're saying when 
you're upset.

684
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,190
I was upset at.
I'm like,

685
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,930
Oh man,
she's upset.

686
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,040
I should stay away.
I think she might might be upset at me.

687
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,540
I don't know if you're upset,
you're upset.

688
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:32,374
But then what I'll do is I think it's 
good to leave you alone because I went 

689
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,510
in [inaudible] case.
She doesn't want to fucking see me and I

690
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:45,250
know that now because I'm like,
Isla,

691
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:48,730
what's wrong?
And he doesn't want to fucking see me.

692
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,503
I'm like,
all right.

693
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,010
That's how she,
it's like,

694
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,910
I just need my coffee.
It's just something like that.

695
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,583
She and I and like the commission is 
dirty and I got to clean it and like I 

696
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,630
just woke up.
It's something like that,

697
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:05,590
like I just don't even want to say.
But you want to be asked.

698
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,600
Yeah.
See,

699
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:07,810
the thing is,
that's what I've learned.

700
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,710
It's a counterintuitive with us.
She actually doesn't want to fucking see

701
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:12,990
me.
But anyway.

702
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,001
No,
I understand.

703
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:14,834
But some people process stuff 
differently so she might need that time 

704
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,350
to do her coffee and get collect 
herself.

705
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:22,750
And maybe you're more of an introvert 
with that stuff.

706
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,610
I think I'm like that when I'm upset.
Oh,

707
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:29,590
you're the worst.
You're avoidant or you don't want to get

708
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:30,424
in your mind a little bit.
Then understand this emotion because I 

709
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:34,480
don't understand what the Ila kind of.
Because I don't feel that way.

710
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,523
So you're upset at not Christina.
Obviously something completely 

711
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,130
different.
And

712
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:40,963
so you're just in a bad mood and then 
somehow that negative energy is just 

713
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:44,510
direct.

714
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,830
Did to whatever is in front of you?
Yeah.

715
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,600
Yeah.
Because he'll get mad at like,

716
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,690
why are there stains on the couch?
And then I'll be like,

717
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,070
oh fuck.
But it's,

718
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,970
I feel like that's directed towards me.
Definitely not.

719
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:57,843
I know,
but I know that rationally it agitates 

720
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:01,510
me.
Ah Fuck.

721
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:06,030
He's mad about reverse.
I think we're totally reversed.

722
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,740
But then you'll also do [inaudible] you 
know,

723
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,753
too much psychology.
I'd be like fucking stains on the couch 

724
00:33:12,431 --> 00:33:13,190
and you'll be like,
oh,

725
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,750
what are you?
Will?

726
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,261
She'll be like,
what?

727
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:15,280
Are you really mad?
I'm like,

728
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:17,830
these goddamn stain.
And then she was like,

729
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,220
let's talk.
And like the stains are not going away.

730
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,470
I don't know.
See.

731
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,150
But where I'm real direct,
I'm like,

732
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,220
we have two dogs.
One's a shelter dog,

733
00:33:27,221 --> 00:33:28,054
ones a pure bred.
The shelter dog can live without the 

734
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:33,310
other one.
The purebred is a lovey machine.

735
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,740
I always say,
I'm like that pure bred lovey machine.

736
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,090
Bitsy,
I love you.

737
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,580
What are you doing?
Let's kind.

738
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,260
That's all I want to touch you.
I want to touch you,

739
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,540
and then you're like,
FIFA.

740
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:43,360
We were like,
I don't know.

741
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,490
Whenever I'm doing my thing.
So when I'm upset though,

742
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:49,690
I'm saying I like to have you there next
to me to have the.

743
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,980
Let's continue this.
That.

744
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,180
Let's go to a break.
We're over.

745
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,090
We're going to continue this 
conversation.

746
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,043
Well,
we are just at the tip of the iceberg 

747
00:33:57,671 --> 00:33:59,290
here.
We're psychologically breaking it down.

748
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,550
Guys.
Do not go away.

749
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,180
We will be right back.
Quip.

750
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,193
All right.
What do I need to say about this 

751
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,100
beautiful,
magical,

752
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:13,270
mythical toothbrush that is changing the
game of dental hygiene?

753
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,253
One of the most important things we can 
do for our health everyday is brushing 

754
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:17,104
our teeth.
Yet most of us aren't doing it properly 

755
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,740
and you're walking around like you just 
had a Turd.

756
00:34:20,741 --> 00:34:21,574
Sandwich quip is a better electric 
toothbrush created by dentists and 

757
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:27,790
designers to make brushing your teeth 
more simple,

758
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:28,624
affordable,
and dare I say this Isla Fun and 

759
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:32,260
enjoyable.
Yeah,

760
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,780
it's that good.
Uh,

761
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,040
this okay.
Here.

762
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,330
Let me tell you about,
first of all,

763
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,360
I have sensitive gums as most of us do,
and gums,

764
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,070
they do not heal back.

765
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,083
You need to find soft,
correct bristles that are not going to 

766
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:48,910
corrode your gums because it's not 
coming back,

767
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,980
right?
That's what this is.

768
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,390
It's soft,
it's rubbery.

769
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,500
It's the best head I've ever found and 
no offense.

770
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:00,530
Isla is get enough on your sensitive 
guns.

771
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:08,230
People brush too hard at some electric 
toothbrushes are way too abrasive.

772
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,540
It's got a built in timer.
That's what this is,

773
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,900
and every 30 seconds it reminds you to 
switch sides,

774
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:17,860
helping guide a fall and even claim up 
to 90 percent of us.

775
00:35:17,861 --> 00:35:20,920
Don't brush for two full minutes and 
don't even clean evenly.

776
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,670
That's what helps you achieve.
All right,

777
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,773
so that's why I love quip.
That's why I don't use any other 

778
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:29,374
toothbrush.
I love quip and that's why it's backed 

779

[inaudible] capterra.com/h

806
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:06,831
three ring is the product that is so 
brilliant,

807
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,410
so revolutionary.
It sells itself.

808
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,273
Now let me give you a personal anecdote.
We live in Los Angeles and there's been 

809
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:18,870
a lot of breakins in general and the Los
Angeles area.

810
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:19,883
And I think that what deters people more
than anything is single rink now have 

811
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:25,860
you see they've got.
It's a,

812
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,903
first of all,
it's a doorbell that has a motion 

813
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,690
sensor.
So when somebody approaches the door at,

814
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:31,524
sends you a mobile notification and it 
saves the video and immediately uploads 

815
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:36,234
it to the cloud.
So we've got one at the doorbell and 

816
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:39,114
then we've got security cameras,
floodlights that instantly activate and 

817
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:45,750
blast with light and record the same way
all around the house.

818
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,913
So in a sense,
there's almost no way to approach the 

819
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,790
house without us being notified and then
checking the video.

820
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,430
It doesn't matter like even alarm 
systems can fail you if you don't have a

821
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,640
shatterproof,
a shatter detector,

822
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,790
they could break it through the window 
at leave without even being seen.

823
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,440
Motion detectors,
they'll go off.

824
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,303
Even if your alarm goes off,
the police aren't gonna arrive for 

825
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:09,090
another 30 minutes because they're 
trying to call you a bunch of times with

826
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:11,730
ring,
you see everything that's going on,

827
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:12,803
but there's no surprises.
And you could call the police 

828
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:15,150
immediately.
Besides that,

829
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,733
somebody stealing packages,
some cuties coming and leaving you a 

830
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:20,130
love note.
You will know who it was.

831
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,100
You know everything that's going around 
your house.

832
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,280
This product is changing the world.
I love it.

833
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,360

because over the last thousand years

00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,340
Especially

896
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,173
having a kid,
I'll tell you that having children is 

897
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:39,890
very healing on,
on one hand and then it dredges up a lot

898
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:41,970
of other stuff on the Internet.
Yeah,

899
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,490
that's what I'm kind of worried about 
too.

900
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:48,491
I don't want all this damage to figure 
it out beforehand.

901
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yes.
Yeah.

902
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,110
I just don't want to be insane all the 
time too,

903
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,870
which affects the kid.
Sure.

904
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,793
Yeah.
Right.

905
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,300
Um,
but uh,

906
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,610
but I do,
I know you guys are.

907
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm a garth brooks fan.
I love Garth Brooks.

908
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,250
He's such an interesting character.
Is he not Hashtag Hashtag there together

909
00:42:13,151 --> 00:42:16,360
at your Mr.
I can't.

910
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,233
I can.
What is winning first for all of our 

911
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:20,294
viewers?
Let's First Watch garth brooks to give 

912
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:22,604
you all a little taste and then we can 
kind of try to get inside his head 

913
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:29,060
because garth Brooks,
I don't understand what's going on.

914
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,470
I can't get a read on this too.

915
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,710
I think it's important because we talk 
about it when we talk about him.

916
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,903
It's important for people not in the 
note because it's fair that there's 

917
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:39,224
different genres and you don't know who 
knows what to recognize how 

918
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,670
inconceivably famous.
This guy is good.

919
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,550
It is out of this world.
It's bonkers.

920
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,230
I think,
and I may be wrong,

921
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:52,940
but last time we were talking about him 
on the show,

922
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,410
he's like the number two or maybe the 
number one best selling.

923
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,780
Oh yeah,
yeah,

924
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:00,950
yeah,
yeah.

925
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,230
Here's the thing.
He outsells the big pop stars of today.

926
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,820
You know,
Bruno Mars,

927
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,953
beyonce,
like he is doing stadiums like we're 

928
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:15,560
fucking football games are played and 
they sell out under an hour.

929
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,720
He's a thumb with a cowboy hat.
Yup.

930
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,840
It's other level.
But you know that he was,

931
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,780
I saw a thing of him on Ellen and he,
uh,

932
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,243
he put out like an anthology thing,
like just released one and it was like 

933
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:29,000
this.

934
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,920
And even she goes,
Jesus Christ,

935
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,840
she goes,
this is volume one,

936
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,040
like there's gonna be more.
He's like,

937
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,840
I think so.
He's like,

938
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,340
most people release these when they're 
dead.

939
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:38,174
That's no fun.
He just puts out raised Christ Jesus 

940
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,200
Christ because you fucking hillbilly 
slapped him in the face and in his eyes,

941
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,320
you fucking monster.
She doesn't curse.

942
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:51,891
No,
no,

943
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:55,040
she didn't say it like Ellen too,
because I find her fascinating.

944
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:55,431
He goes,
well,

945
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:57,180
but also super famous.
Let's.

946
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:58,014
Yeah,
I think it really fucks with you to be 

947
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,770
that famous.
I think so too.

948
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,570
I think so too.
But,

949
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:03,404
but garth,
but here's why we find him fascinating 

950
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,133
because I look and no one's disputing 
that he's very talented and he's very 

951
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:12,230
successful.
We're not dumping on this guy for that.

952
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,530
But it's that there's something that 
doesn't read,

953
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,130
like don't understand the man.
Right.

954
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,420
You know what it is.

955
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,580
It's like if you go,
what's Ethan like,

956
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,720
what's he like?
Which Christina like and you go,

957
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:27,554
this is kind of their personality,
but with him it feels like a 

958
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,110
manufactured personality in the social 
media posts.

959
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,123
It always feels like we're saying the 
right thing at the right time and it 

960
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,970
feels that reads to a lot of people as 
inauthentic.

961
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:46,380
I'm not saying that necessarily is,
but he reads like this can mean if,

962
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:51,620
if it's just like a four is you're like,
yeah,

963
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,690
is he just euphoric?
And I said,

964
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,190
I don't think so.
I think he's a creep.

965
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,540
I think by the way he's in the videos,
he's just like,

966
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,180
thank God,
thank God for my life.

967
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,030
Like he's just this euphoric guy.
Like maybe that's just who he is.

968
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:11,031
I think if maybe I want world peace.
I think what happens too is you do these

969
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:18,650
three hour plus shows to 80 100,000
people screaming and everyone's like,

970
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:20,670
you're the gray like that many people.

971
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,510
Your your the same bet that he walks 
around like,

972
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,710
you know,
like that.

973
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,440
I really liked that.
Well,

974
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:29,303
for a long texts,
everyone watching less with let's enjoy 

975
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:31,914
some of that recent highlights of the 
beautiful and wonderful a national 

976
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:37,140
treasure,
if you will,

977
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,023
or garth brooks.
I regret in my dream for us to love one 

978
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:42,810
another.
All of us,

979
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,013
he leans in because borderline that 
almost like if you took the words out 

980
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,703
saying that is like,
I'd like to fuck you in the ass hard 

981
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:56,281
tonight.
You know,

982
00:45:56,281 --> 00:46:00,420
it's like a weird sexual tax.
He's saying that his wish for.

983
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,160
What was that?
What was the beginning of world peace?

984
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,920
My wish is for all of us to love each 
other,

985
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,930
but it's like for this Christmas a one 
of those things.

986
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:11,400
It's like,
what's your wish?

987
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:11,970
And he's like,
well,

988
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,480
my wish is for world peace.
First of all,

989
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,900
whenever someone's like,
what's your wish for world peace?

990
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,780
No,
you're not only an abusive.

991
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,193
Yeah.

992
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:26,400
See,
that's the real question.

993
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:31,401
What is garth wish?
Garth's wish he doesn't know.

994
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,950
By the way,
I've seen him wear this shirt,

995
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:39,660
this nike shirt in multiple press 
outings,

996
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,790
which makes me also think that he's 
like,

997
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:42,624
it's kind of.
This is what people were Kesha Grand 

998
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,690
Knight,
Knight.

999
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,050
Tommy,
I think you've hit on it.

1000
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,510
He's pretending pretending to be a 
person.

1001
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,383
He's actually like a building.
This stadium store he's going to do 

1002
00:46:57,931 --> 00:46:59,070
right now.
No Shit.

1003
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:03,270
He's going to earn like $400 million.
And the thing is that,

1004
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,310
that's crazy.
Country Music is all about.

1005
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,820
I'm just an average Joe.
I fucked my cousin,

1006
00:47:08,821 --> 00:47:11,040
but that's okay.
The Yankees don't like it,

1007
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:12,930
but we think it's all right.
Yes.

1008
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,050
And so that's actually one of.
Not that guy.

1009
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,990
It's all about still being.
I'm keeping it real and I'm just,

1010
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,093
I'm,
I'm just one of y'all shocks like a 

1011
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:26,730
private jet.
But that's the thing is that it's got.

1012
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,440
It's all about.
I'm just like,

1013
00:47:28,441 --> 00:47:30,100
y'all all this money,
bull shit don't

1014
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,150
mean nothing.
And that list.

1015
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,480
And I may have a jet stream five.
Yeah.

1016
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:38,260
But oldest money shit don't mean nothing
when you can't fuck your cousin.

1017
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,310
Yeah,
exactly.

1018
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,583
All right,
let's watch this and have some fun and 

1019
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:44,110
let's get fiscal playing music.
Kind of like that.

1020
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,770
You hold it too long.
I love this.

1021
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,890
Thank you.
God bless you guys.

1022
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:53,690
I love that.
Thank you for this.

1023
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,690
Thank you for my life.
God bless you guys.

1024
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,940
Instagram.
Hashtag ask.

1025
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,970
Garth asked me anything.
Okay.

1026
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,110
Hashtag happy.
Hashtag Gore.

1027
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:04,630
Mr Harwood.
Oh,

1028
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,030
Hashtag you're in.
What do you mean?

1029
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,660
What do you mean?
Hey,

1030
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:14,560
if you have to ask yourself,
is making it rain?

1031
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,083
Do you think that those four seconds 
stares at the end of the videos are 

1032
00:48:21,311 --> 00:48:26,311
because he's told somebody like,
like when when I'm done I smile at you.

1033
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:28,270
Let that Shit fucking roll.
So they.

1034
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,130
No,
no,

1035
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:33,220
no,
be relaxed or do you think he's like,

1036
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:34,323
I think when I'm done talking you'll 
know I'm fucking done when I smile and 

1037
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:38,290
then just let it roll.

1038
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,700
People like when I smile and they're 
like,

1039
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,720
alright.
And then he finally came too old school.

1040
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,940
He's posing for a photo with.
For his aunt.

1041
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:49,933
Yeah,
exactly.

1042
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,510
And he just holds it.
Geez.

1043
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,940
And also what's disingenuous about the 
smile?

1044
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:56,890
Because real smiles,
your face lights up,

1045
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,533
it's in the eyes.
The smile is always in the eyes and the 

1046
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:04,300
smile doesn't match the eyes.
The chew like a three year old man.

1047
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,400
They tell you to smile.
The picture.

1048
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,480
Yeah.
Like fucking John Wayne Gacy.

1049
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,490
When you look at his face,
I mean he.

1050
00:49:10,491 --> 00:49:15,491
He's such a Dang dingus human hot dog.
He's so real.

1051
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,523
He's a fucking official dad.
Like he could be on the debt front page 

1052
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:23,344
of Dad weekly with a big head stadium.
Was the daughter of your cousin called 

1053
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:32,160
the daughter of your cousin?
You have a cousin had a dumb job.

1054
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,870
No,
I was setting it up.

1055
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,183
I was just trying to set up a country 
song where just because my daughter is 

1056
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:43,020
my second cousin,
don't dump man.

1057
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,380
I love her any less.
I'm going to write some tunes.

1058
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,613
They weren't ready to go.
I to remind me of fucking crickets 

1059
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:00,100
thing.
That's brutal.

1060
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:00,741
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1061
00:50:00,741 --> 00:50:01,160
yeah,
yeah.

1062
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,010
I love that.
I like that.

1063
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,023
I really like that.
I want to watch that one again because 

1064
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,710
we've watched it on this podcast,
but it's such a fucking masterpiece.

1065
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,250
That is one of my favorite videos.
Well,

1066
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,170
I guess it's official tearing down the 
walls.

1067
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,133
You know what's happening now is that 
this is picking up steam now on twitter 

1068
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,010
that garth brooks is feed is weird.
Like this

1069
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,200
is.
We're starting away.

1070
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:30,630
Have you guys,
you know he's going to.

1071
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,543
He's not going to understand.
He's like 20 million phones and he 

1072
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:36,290
didn't be like,
well I'm fucking garth brooks.

1073
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:37,910
No,
no,

1074
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,743
no,
but it's like 19 million people that 

1075
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:41,890
want to see you be weird.
Millennials,

1076
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,270
I want to say tim and Eric make a 
episode with Garth Brooks.

1077
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:47,360
Like,
all right,

1078
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,450
let's ahead.
This humid hot dog.

1079
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,313
Yeah,

1080
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:55,870
just the player over radio on radio.

1081
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,840
Oh,
is this vic burgers?

1082
00:50:58,841 --> 00:51:00,150
Cut.
No.

1083
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:02,763
Queen's birthday.
So I'm taking over all are socialists 

1084
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,040
Hashtag happy birthday tuition.

1085
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,910
Let me ask this question to why on 
Trisha's birth birthday

1086
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:24,220
is he taking over?
He asked me how I know.

1087
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,553
Well,
why is he taking over Trisha's socials 

1088
00:51:30,031 --> 00:51:31,410
for her birthday?
It's like,

1089
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,423
how is that a president gift?
A gift is that I'm the best and you're 

1090
00:51:36,421 --> 00:51:37,254
not going to take over.
You could have made a post on your own 

1091
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:40,350
self.
Don't be like,

1092
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,850
send her some love.
Right?

1093
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:42,803
He's like,
you know what,

1094
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:46,020
I'm not going to shit post on my own 
social page.

1095
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,740
I'm going to do it on yours.
Right?

1096
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:49,860
Her fans open.
They're like,

1097
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,060
oh,
thank God it's garth.

1098
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:51,960
This is awesome.
Hey,

1099
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,030
go hashtag.
I'm Mr.

1100
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,890
uh,
Mr Today.

1101
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,380
That's her last name,
her last name.

1102
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,470
So what he's doing is doing this 
condescending thing of like,

1103
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:03,810
I'm the mega star.
She's down here,

1104
00:52:03,811 --> 00:52:05,790
but I'm,
I'm so humble.

1105
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,920
I'm down home today.
Just today,

1106
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:08,731
just today.
Um,

1107
00:52:08,731 --> 00:52:10,320
Mr Gear.
But here's the thing,

1108
00:52:10,321 --> 00:52:10,560
man.

1109
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,610
It's like that.
Um,

1110
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,500
I love Mike.
That post is a,

1111
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,710
what is that?
That's a perfect husband posts.

1112
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,280
Yeah.
All.

1113
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,450
He goes,
it's like from the beginning it's like I

1114
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:19,284
love her so much and show her how much 
you love her to just put pictures of 

1115
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:24,930
cakes Tagore.
And it's like,

1116
00:52:24,931 --> 00:52:26,040
so if you watch that,
you're like,

1117
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:28,710
oh,
this guy's just this normal sweet guy.

1118
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:32,640
Just loves his wife is bullshit.
And what does he do for a hobby?

1119
00:52:32,641 --> 00:52:35,460
That's what I want to isla thinks.
Isla has this amazing,

1120
00:52:35,461 --> 00:52:36,294
authentic and transparent what they 
tagged that as I look at the thumbnail 

1121
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:45,681
alone,
so let's do this one too.

1122
00:52:46,511 --> 00:52:51,511
It was like pay attention to those odd 
voice like octave changes.

1123
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:57,060
There's so there's so deliberate and the
choice to do them.

1124
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,700
They're deliberate and they don't line 
up.

1125
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,800
Like why?
Why you would go?

1126
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,810
I like,
well like that.

1127
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:09,500
I really liked the thing about reads the
growth,

1128
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,520
but the thing about this is that it's so
rehearsed.

1129
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:15,383
It's like,
yes,

1130
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,610
it's like a beat for beat.
Like I feel like this is take 100.

1131
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,480
Oh yeah.
And he sent it to an assistant and goes,

1132
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,910
just finished this gold fucking post 
that right now.

1133
00:53:23,911 --> 00:53:25,020
Shithead.
And then the guy was,

1134
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,630
all right,
put that up.

1135
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,473
Garth said to put it up right here.
It was a very telling moment to put it 

1136
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:34,590
on when he was reporting to us from 
studio g and I know what you're going to

1137
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,424
talk to.
And he was doing his spontaneous garth 

1138
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:41,280
thing and then the door opened suddenly 
and he's like,

1139
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:44,850
is that supposed to happen?
And you can see the rage behind his eyes

1140
00:53:44,851 --> 00:53:46,950
and what it is.
It's his birthday and they're surprising

1141
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:47,784
him with a cane.
It's a fraction of a second inside 

1142
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:56,710
studio g you see the rage behind his 
eyes and make sure out.

1143
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:00,210
I'll be up there for y'all.
I'll be singing my songs.

1144
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:02,040
And then he goes,
is that supposed to happen?

1145
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,800
He's like,
happy birthday.

1146
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:13,510
Happy Birthday to Ge.
Refers to himself.

1147
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,570
Yeah,
that's on.

1148
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:21,080
That's on a facebook studio.
G posts inside studio g or that one?

1149
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:24,220
Were you in that moment?
Was It on facebook?

1150
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,650
I want to see it when he's,
uh,

1151
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,890
when he's given you backstage,
he does like a GE alert and he does,

1152
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:29,970
uh,
he,

1153
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:30,870
he's like,
Hey,

1154
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:31,770
look at all these,
uh,

1155
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,830
like it was rehearsal sound check.
And he's telling you how,

1156
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:35,664
like everybody,
they come to my shows sometimes they're 

1157
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:37,981
like,
look at that guy,

1158
00:54:37,981 --> 00:54:38,814
look at that guy.
It's so neat watching everybody else 

1159
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:41,320
work.
Like trying to give credits,

1160
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,020
fighting guide.
So neat.

1161
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,030
Yeah.
And then he goes,

1162
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,031
he goes,
hey,

1163
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,870
dave turned that down.
Dave.

1164
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,950
Turn it down.
And you could see days like,

1165
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:54,951
oh my life's about to say,
but that's the real guy.

1166
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,750
Yeah,
Dude.

1167
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,050
I bet.

1168
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:59,190
He's like,
I really like.

1169
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:02,880
That is a control.
He's a dictator,

1170
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:03,743
is the way I think he is.
This is the guy whose music never ended 

1171
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:08,250
up on Itunes,
get an exclusive deal with Walmart.

1172
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,340
That means he's business savvy,
but he's also really in control.

1173
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,760
Really calling the shots.
And also let's talk about his alter ego.

1174
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:18,720
Chris Gaines,
this guy is a gold mine.

1175
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:19,554
It's just bizarre.
This gains is one of the weirdest thing 

1176
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,990
that ever happened to one of the 
weirdest things ever happened for people

1177
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:25,824
they don't know.
He got so famous and board being garth 

1178
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:30,090
did.
He created an Australian,

1179
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:32,780
I think alter ego's very weird.
Aaron died.

1180
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,650
Let me throw up.
But here's the other thing.

1181
00:55:34,651 --> 00:55:35,484
Oh,
savagery of this is that Chris was 

1182
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:40,254
almost wiped entirely to internet.
Do you know how hard it is to do that 

1183
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:48,180
damn near?
It's really very little out there.

1184
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,510
He's coming back because people are 
talking about Chris Gay dude.

1185
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,403
He.
This whole kind of Garth Brooks' name 

1186
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:56,813
that's brewing is going to be something 
new for him because you cannot fight 

1187
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:02,670
against me more.
Fair.

1188
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,750
What if it went like this for a while 
and then like it built it,

1189
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:08,760
built it pissed him off and then they 
were like,

1190
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:12,000
guess what?
Garth Brooks has 10 bodies buried on his

1191
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,320
fucking land.
Like He.

1192
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,410
That would make sense.
Yeah,

1193
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,560
he's makes sense.
Can you talk about that?

1194
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:19,470
When he did Chris Gaines,
a photo shoots,

1195
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,573
he would suck his cheeks and because 
Chris wasn't supposed to be as big as 

1196
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:24,530
Garth,
so that's why I.

1197
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,600
So you can see us do.
It was like a vampire.

1198
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:30,930
I think it looks cute as Chris Gaines.
I'm digging Chris Gaines actually,

1199
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,180
he's Kinda Gotten Kinda hot.
It's cool.

1200
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,850
It is an odd choice though,
right?

1201
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:37,684
To be so it's,
it's essentially like ever never been 

1202
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:40,810
anything like that.

1203
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,520
Right.
Like the biggest star in music.

1204
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:43,354
But like I'm done.
I'm going to do this realize because I 

1205
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:47,980
was reading so much garth stuff that 
when he did this,

1206
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:49,390
you know,
no one could talk them out of it.

1207
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,280
Right.
Do you think his manager,

1208
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:53,380
I'm talking about this don't do this,
and he was like,

1209
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:54,360
I'm Chris got,
I'm doing it,

1210
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,550
and then they're like,
it did poorly,

1211
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:58,720
obviously,
like it wasn't.

1212
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:00,483
It was a disaster,
but still just people knowing that it 

1213
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:07,270
was him doing it.
I think I want to say it moved somewhere

1214
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:10,360
close to a million still,
so that's still like,

1215
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,730
that's huge.
Yeah.

1216
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:12,600
Yeah.
But he was like,

1217
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:14,980
I'm still 25 million,
I'm sure just what I do.

1218
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,270
And then they're like,
oh,

1219
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:17,800
I only sold a million.
He was like,

1220
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:18,634
oh,
that sucks.

1221
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:23,620
But I think it's part of that crazy 
insane ego.

1222
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:27,490
Ego's ism where he's like,
I'm going to go make pop music.

1223
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,230
Can be an email singer.
Yeah,

1224
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,150
that's exceeded that.
It just looked it up.

1225
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:33,130
His Chris Gaines album went double 
platinum,

1226
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,953
filtered a tremendous failure.
That is how successful that guy's used 

1227
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:40,450
to being,
I guess.

1228
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,800
Well,
actually I remember reading,

1229
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:44,770
and correct me if I'm wrong,
they had like this huge release and they

1230
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:45,604
bought tons of albums and it was filling
all the music stores and while he did 

1231
00:57:49,391 --> 00:57:52,050
sell a lot,
there was a little bit.

1232
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,040
Overstock.
Overstock for sure.

1233
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,880
Sorry.
I know I'm just reeling.

1234
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:00,370
I'm also thinking of rock stars.
I'm sorry.

1235
00:58:00,371 --> 00:58:01,204
Actors that became rock stars.
It's like I'm not really successful in 

1236
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:06,124
this thing.
Let's fuck that up by trying to 

1237
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,500
coordinate.
Let's list who we can think of.

1238
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,870
Juliet Lewis is doing it right.
She does that.

1239
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:16,770
She's like actually still touring.
Great though.

1240
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,180
I think she does.
Bruce Willis.

1241
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:20,470
Oh yeah.
Oh,

1242
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,640
you got to see that Keanu.
Keanu.

1243
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,123
Yes.
The Johnny Depp very actively to the 

1244
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:33,781
greatest of all times to golf.
Golf course plays a seller.

1245
00:58:33,941 --> 00:58:35,710
Okay.
Yeah.

1246
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,880
This is really something.
There was one billy Bob Thorton,

1247
00:58:39,881 --> 00:58:42,580
I dunno if you guys recall.
He was very serious about that.

1248
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:43,960
Okay.
There's another one.

1249
00:58:43,961 --> 00:58:46,370
He went on a late night show I recall 
and they were,

1250
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:48,850
and he was like,
I'm only here to talk about my music.

1251
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,460
Eddie Murphy a murder,
and that guy has an amazing voice,

1252
00:58:57,461 --> 00:58:59,180
but somehow it was just the corniest 
thing ever.

1253
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:01,360
It was awful.
And he was like,

1254
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:05,140
I don't want to.
Even he joined twitter,

1255
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:08,830
I want to say he joined twitter to put 
out a music video.

1256
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,050
Yeah.
And people were like that.

1257
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,140
He was just like,
I'm going about my album now.

1258
00:59:14,141 --> 00:59:14,974
I will say the person,
the one person I can think of who it 

1259
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:19,240
really worked for was Donald Glover.
Oh,

1260
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:20,530
that's true.
He's childish.

1261
00:59:20,531 --> 00:59:22,280
Gambino.
Drake.

1262
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,390
Okay.
I thought I was a lesbian before,

1263
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:31,391
but this is like Donald Glover can 
actually really do all those things.

1264
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:34,790
You know,
he can.

1265
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:35,623
He's really good at it.
So I think some of the other guys were 

1266
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:41,180
talking about like 15 plus years of 
being a movie star.

1267
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,360
Like you're a household name a thing,
bro.

1268
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,620
No.
See you saying,

1269
00:59:45,621 --> 00:59:46,730
man,
you wasn't shit.

1270
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,950
I want to ask you guys about a story 
here.

1271
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,020
Sure.
Don't know what to make of it.

1272
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:53,150
It's one of the most bizarre things.
Yeah.

1273
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,650
Um,
so let me,

1274
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,120
let me start here.
Okay.

1275
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,373
There was a teacher who is in a hot 
water after getting into a fistfight 

1276
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:06,320
with a 14 year old student after the 
student berated him,

1277
01:00:06,321 --> 01:00:09,110
calling him the n word and throwing a 
basketball at him.

1278
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,300
Jesus.
So now there's a video.

1279
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:15,140
There's a video of this.
This is what's so crazy to me.

1280
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,020
Let let me show you the video first and 
then I'll tell you about the aftermath,

1281
01:00:18,021 --> 01:00:18,854
which is really what's perplexing to me.
So let's enjoy this a right in our 

1282
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:28,750
American school system and they'll skip 
forward to where the good stuff happens.

1283
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,103
You could tell this kid's a little piece
of shit all day nine and if you're the 

1284
01:00:45,691 --> 01:00:46,524
one lying bro,
you know you said that shape right here 

1285
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:58,610
at home.
You want me to wait first of all this?

1286
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,453
It is still.
It is insane that for me that a student 

1287
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:09,614
is like,
just like in front of the class saying 

1288
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,330
that shit.
I don't know what leads to this,

1289
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:14,660
but it's crazy to watch.
Well,

1290
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:19,661
apparently the backstory is that this 
teacher was beloved by the school and he

1291
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:25,610
is meant to be very calm.
Nice guy.

1292
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:26,743
Right?
But I guess something just snaps in him 

1293
01:01:28,491 --> 01:01:31,060
in this moment as you'll see.
But this kids like him,

1294
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,650
he's the shit and he's trying to get 
under them.

1295
01:01:33,651 --> 01:01:35,940
Right.
And I think they have a history together

1296
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:36,973
as well.

1297
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,900
These schools are rough though.
Like cuts.

1298
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:02,030
Oh yeah,
he,

1299
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:21,030
he broke them in.
I mean it's obviously not okay at all.

1300
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,133
But I think that kid,
he's probably been doing that for a 

1301
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:26,140
while.
Yeah,

1302
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:28,870
that's fucking crazy.
It's crazy to see.

1303
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,300
He really goes after and feel me just 
one that's a grown ass man.

1304
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,500
And now here he act like he doesn't 
remember what happened.

1305
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,050
Oh yeah.
Now he's.

1306
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:47,640
Yeah,
he's panicking.

1307
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:48,880
Yeah,
he's playing.

1308
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,620
He's playing a.
He was like,

1309
01:02:50,621 --> 01:02:51,510
who hit him?
What happened?

1310
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:52,061
Yeah,
yeah,

1311
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:52,780
yeah.
No that was it.

1312
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,330
That was mad.
And we missed it.

1313
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:58,780
Just prior to where you started.
It was when he had a basketball.

1314
01:02:58,781 --> 01:03:01,040
The kid threw it at him.
Why?

1315
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:05,080
He actually did instigate the physical 
aspect of it.

1316
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,413
Did I miss?
Maybe it's when it's still vertical 

1317
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:11,893
basketball.
So the kid throws the basketball per 

1318
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,850
teacher.
So.

1319
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,830
So here's the part where it gets really 
surprising.

1320
01:03:19,831 --> 01:03:22,890
Okay.
Well what do I feel bad for everybody?

1321
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:24,720
It's a rough school,
I'm sure.

1322
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:25,820
Like where?
Where is life?

1323
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:27,450
Where it's in La?
It's here in la.

1324
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:28,520
I think that's what I read.
Oh,

1325
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:29,403
Portola.
Junior high.

1326
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:31,890
He's a music teacher of all things.
Yeah.

1327
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:35,010
You went.
I went to,

1328
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:39,330
but I did go to public school or two of 
them in La and they're pretty horrible.

1329
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,850
Yeah,
the ones I went to anyways,

1330
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,630
that's pretty much some shit that 
happens.

1331
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:43,464
Yeah,
you can see some really bad homes and 

1332
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:48,600
it's hard.
I don't know how to deal with a kid like

1333
01:03:48,601 --> 01:03:49,434
that,
you know?

1334
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:52,020
But regardless.
So now,

1335
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:54,930
uh,
opinions are deeply divided.

1336
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,080
Yeah.
Um,

1337
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:00,460
and here this is the part that blew me 
away.

1338
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,353
This guy is a pro.
I mean he's definitely going to be 

1339
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:03,940
fired,
right?

1340
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:04,953
Yeah.
He's definitely going to have to think 

1341
01:04:05,951 --> 01:04:06,784
so.
But then now there's a go fund me for 

1342
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:12,490
this guy,
$150,000,

1343
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:13,960
God.
And I was like,

1344
01:04:13,961 --> 01:04:16,330
Holy Shit.
What does it say here?

1345
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,760
This is,
is that him saying,

1346
01:04:18,761 --> 01:04:20,080
hey,
this one's real.

1347
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:21,003
I just want you all to know and I'm 
letting you know that this go fund me 

1348
01:04:24,821 --> 01:04:27,350
page is legit.
Yeah,

1349
01:04:27,351 --> 01:04:29,230
that's about it.
Where's maywood?

1350
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:32,200
Maywood Academy High School.
Oh,

1351
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,730
he was.
He was sent to jail.

1352
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:36,620
He assaulted a child.

1353
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:39,763
Yeah.

1354
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,840
Where does it say it?
Said what you have seen the video.

1355
01:04:43,841 --> 01:04:44,674
I will not post here.
And sadly he was handcuffed and sent to 

1356
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:48,840
jail,
which does make sense.

1357
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,013
I mean kind of.
I mean he assaulted as we kick the shit 

1358
01:04:54,911 --> 01:04:56,290
out of.
You can't really do that.

1359
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,240
Like if he threw one punch I,
it'd be like,

1360
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:59,560
oh,
he was threatened.

1361
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:02,110
But then he's beat the shit out of it.
Listen,

1362
01:05:02,111 --> 01:05:04,510
I understand kids trigger the shit out 
of you,

1363
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:07,070
but you can't hit them.
You know,

1364
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:07,930
he really,
he,

1365
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:12,990
he went after that kid is may and 
started beating like La South La,

1366
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,050
south La Belle.
It's,

1367
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:18,903
I mean,
I think everyone relates to that 

1368
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:21,363
teachers

1369
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,490
feeling,
but you just.

1370
01:05:23,491 --> 01:05:25,940
I mean if you're the EDC you can't do.
That's what I'm doing.

1371
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,050
And so I was like,
wow,

1372
01:05:28,051 --> 01:05:28,531
that,
you know,

1373
01:05:28,531 --> 01:05:30,690
I feel bad for everybody.
But then when I saw that they had raised

1374
01:05:30,691 --> 01:05:32,370
150,000,
that blew me away.

1375
01:05:32,371 --> 01:05:33,204
I was like,
who is why it happened to the kid and 

1376
01:05:34,711 --> 01:05:37,560
the kid can't get in anywhere.
There's no news.

1377
01:05:37,561 --> 01:05:40,800
It's just Mr Riley is a.
They did.

1378
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,140
They did actually expel the kid.
They did.

1379
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,980
Yeah.
Well the PR,

1380
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:46,003
they're transferring to a different 
school to try and cut down on the drama 

1381
01:05:49,201 --> 01:05:49,921
basically.
I mean,

1382
01:05:49,921 --> 01:05:52,080
look,
the thing is popping off five,

1383
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,660
100.
This is three minutes ago.

1384
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,150
It really is.
So there you go.

1385
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:57,910
Dude.
I wish.

1386
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:59,160
I wonder if someone would do that for 
me.

1387
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:02,790
You know how to really think about that.
Just you can punch me in the phase right

1388
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:05,940
now or vice versa,
whatever.

1389
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,930
I wonder if people will be like,
yeah,

1390
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:11,820
we got it.
We got to help out at a step up for Tom.

1391
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,020
I've never seen a teacher had a kid.
I've.

1392
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:15,821
No,
it's not.

1393
01:06:15,821 --> 01:06:18,400
Well,
one time I had saw a teacher.

1394
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:19,800
CIOCCA kid.
Oh,

1395
01:06:19,801 --> 01:06:21,250
that's pretty scary.
Pine.

1396
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,373
It was a nice private school I went to.
I was in kindergarten and this kid 

1397
01:06:25,691 --> 01:06:27,910
wouldn't stop eating roly polies,
you know,

1398
01:06:27,911 --> 01:06:30,080
those little bugs.
And um,

1399
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:35,060
I think her name was ms dot darlene 
choked him once in a while.

1400
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:38,560
It was wildly throw.
It was a 1980.

1401
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:40,850
Yeah,
that was it.

1402
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:44,080
I've now I'm just remembering this and 
she choked him and he turned red.

1403
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:45,320
I remember how she,

1404
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,590
that'll teach you not to eat.
Rolling,

1405
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:52,970
you know,
I was having flashbacks now to have.

1406
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:57,560
We had a principal and he wasn't fired 
for this and I found it quite traumatic.

1407
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:01,160
There was this girl,
she was just seemed fine,

1408
01:07:01,161 --> 01:07:05,810
but she was really anti authority and 
this was like in fifth grade and he came

1409
01:07:05,811 --> 01:07:09,200
into the class and he whispered 
something to her like,

1410
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,063
Hey,
I need you to come into that office and 

1411
01:07:11,121 --> 01:07:12,530
we're all watching.
It was like a whole scene.

1412
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:13,341
And she's like,
no,

1413
01:07:13,341 --> 01:07:16,850
I'm not getting up.
And he grabs her arm and he yanks are so

1414
01:07:16,851 --> 01:07:17,684
hard.
That desk falls over and he drank and 

1415
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:22,820
she drags her by the arm.
What age?

1416
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:27,580
We weren't fifth grade.
So what the fuck dude?

1417
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,680
And he wasn't fired for that.
They thought that was all good.

1418
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:34,270
That's different time.
His name was Mr Monday mine,

1419
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,020
which makes sense because everybody 
fucking hates Monday.

1420
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:38,920
We hated that guy.

1421
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:45,060
I remembered.
I see.

1422
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:45,953
I remember hearing up things.
I never saw a teacher really do 

1423
01:07:49,531 --> 01:07:53,990
something that crazy,
but I do remember seeing we have trouble

1424
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:54,853
like a troublemaker kid and in high 
school and he was fucking off and like 

1425
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:00,493
one of the administration people came in
the room and a big guy and the way that 

1426
01:08:06,871 --> 01:08:09,540
he yelled at this kid who was already a 
bad kid,

1427
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:11,850
we were all like,
holy shit man.

1428
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:14,030
I feel like I turned like just.
He goes,

1429
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,250
you're never gonna amount to shit.

1430
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,770
You're nothing.
And you're like,

1431
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:20,420
nobody lectured them like that.
And it just got really aggressive.

1432
01:08:20,421 --> 01:08:21,254
We were all like,
fuck to hear an adult yell at a kid who 

1433
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:26,334
is already problematic and be like,
you're not going to amount to shit and 

1434
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,410
nothing.
And we were like,

1435
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:33,670
it was,
it was way.

1436
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:34,543
It was more brutal than I'm think seeing
somebody get hit just because he just 

1437
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:39,680
tore him down.
That's crazy.

1438
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,420
Yeah,
the thing is I actually,

1439
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:45,350
now that I'm a little more mature and 
having a baby soon,

1440
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:50,980
I understand that kids,
these kids are already kind of like a.

1441
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:55,580
They came up in a bad place that's so 
fucked up,

1442
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:57,880
so they are blameless in in a sense that
he likes.

1443
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:00,530
He got it right with this guy too,
so fucked up.

1444
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:04,370
Kid was a piece that you followed him 
since and while that was happening,

1445
01:09:04,371 --> 01:09:05,070
you're like,
I'm gonna,

1446
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:06,120
I'm gonna.
See if he's right now.

1447
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,570
So follow.
This is a piece of shit.

1448
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:10,760
It didn't go well.
It didn't turn out well.

1449
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:12,920
The question is would he be.
If he didn't get that,

1450
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:15,370
maybe he was destined.
He was.

1451
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:16,223
It was going to be.
I was always going to be rough for him 

1452
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:18,230
and it ended up

1453
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:20,030
being pretty rough.
So true man.

1454
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,590
All those kids.
I grew up with two,

1455
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:22,424
there was one kid that used to flip his 
eyelids and right on his arm and 

1456
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:28,910
permanent marker and he was like 
hyperactive and crazy like he grew up to

1457
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:32,710
be a drug dealer and you can lose her to
kind of know when they're losers.

1458
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:35,150
Kids even I can tell a preschool.
I dropped my kid off,

1459
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:36,470
my God,
my kid's a fucking loser.

1460
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:40,120
You can tell a fucking psycho already.
Yeah.

1461
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:41,900
Oh yeah.
Problem is they have shitty parents.

1462
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:42,980
That's right.
It's not the kid.

1463
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:44,523
It's a shitty parents.
You got to pay attention to those 

1464
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:46,500
parents.
You still,

1465
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,720
you.
You'll see it right away.

1466
01:09:47,721 --> 01:09:48,554
You'll start to key on it more now,
but when you do like go to a park or 

1467
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:54,320
something and you look at the adult and 
you're like,

1468
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:55,400
oh,
this motherfucker.

1469
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:57,530
No Way.
No Way.

1470
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,140
When you just started about judge or a 
whole new world,

1471
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:02,210
here's the thing,
my mistake,

1472
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:05,630
because I started going to those mommy 
and me classes and stuff and I thought,

1473
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,310
oh,
it's like this cool sorority,

1474
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:08,144
like we're all in this club of people 
that birth other people and all these 

1475
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:11,954
women are going to be awesome and it 
turns out it's just like a fucking 

1476
01:10:14,661 --> 01:10:15,494
office.
Like when you work in an office and 

1477
01:10:16,491 --> 01:10:17,324
you're like 90 percent of these people 
suck it really hard and maybe there's 

1478
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:22,290
like two cool people you don't want to

1479
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:23,623
can shit out of baby.
That's the thing that I'm starting to 

1480
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,640
feel with Isla private.
It feels so special and amazing.

1481
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,474
It's exciting and I'm already like,
love this kid so much and feels 

1482
01:10:33,081 --> 01:10:34,590
incredible.
I,

1483
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:35,310
I,
I.

1484
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:36,890
The only thing I can relate it to is our
dog,

1485
01:10:36,891 --> 01:10:40,580
which I since we got him has been like 
the center of my life.

1486
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:41,740
I love him so much.
Yeah.

1487
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:43,040
And I'm like,
oh my God,

1488
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,690
this baby's going to be like way beyond 
that.

1489
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:45,973
And it feels like so unique and special 
and then you realize that everybody's 

1490
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:51,830
got a fucking kid and that's part of the
problem.

1491
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,380
But do you realize how many of them.
Do you ever think about how many of them

1492
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,333
don't go?
Like,

1493
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:57,290
oh,
this is the fucking most amazing thing.

1494
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,530
There's definitely a lot of people like 
that who are like,

1495
01:11:00,531 --> 01:11:01,460
yeah,
we haven't a kid.

1496
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:02,883
My mom,
I'd say a lot of people are like that 

1497
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:07,550
and they just treat it like no big deal.
I think it just really,

1498
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:10,250
I think mean Ila got so lucky in the 
timing of it.

1499
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,700
We've got everything in the right place.
I could see if I,

1500
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:16,140
if I had a baby when I was 18,
that baby be fucked.

1501
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:19,860
So I think about that a lot.
That baby would be fucked.

1502
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:20,843
Oh yeah.
You think about when you busted in some 

1503
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:24,150
chick and you're like,
shit,

1504
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:27,350
if she had had that kid,
I'd be fucked.

1505
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,253
Yeah,
it'd be like talking to like my 22 year 

1506
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:32,010
old son right now.
And He'd be like,

1507
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:33,330
we're worried.
I'd be like,

1508
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,740
I was trying to do shit,
man.

1509
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,130
Things are all right now.
Do you want to go to Jamaica?

1510
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,150
Let's go.
I'll take you.

1511
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,620
I mean you probably would.

1512
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:41,723
You probably wouldn't.
You'd probably be driving a truck or 

1513
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:44,550
something.
Yeah,

1514
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,383
probably.
I mean I didn't know what your capacity 

1515
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,110
is.
You would not be living your dream.

1516
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:50,820
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1517
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:51,683
But have you had those thoughts though 
about like this gang that skank some 

1518
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:55,764
other scanning all the chicks that you 
would call them and manny with 

1519
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:04,710
protection.
Think about dumping all those clips into

1520
01:12:04,711 --> 01:12:06,930
those family wagons and you're just 
like,

1521
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:10,200
man,
that could have been my baby mama.

1522
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:14,130
How many women as I can we talk about 
partners?

1523
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:18,900
How mean it's got to be less than we go 
with the horse?

1524
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:20,220
Shit.
Let me tell you,

1525
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,480
I won't lie.
You think he lives about how many people

1526
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:26,700
you know?
Here's a firm number.

1527
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,450
Well,
let's,

1528
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,520
let's crush Tom.
How many paid love you?

1529
01:12:29,521 --> 01:12:30,840
Fuck that.
You can ballpark it.

1530
01:12:30,841 --> 01:12:32,450
Here's the.
It's not that high.

1531
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:34,320
What it is is this.
This is the truth.

1532
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:37,770
I W I didn't have many relationships.
So there's like.

1533
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,020
I'll think of the numbers and I'll be 
like,

1534
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:40,950
oh,
it's not that high,

1535
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,480
and then as I'm counting,
I'm like,

1536
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,373
Oh yeah,
there was that beach week where I met 

1537
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:46,134
that chick so well.
I couldn't even tell what race she was 

1538
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:51,330
like before I became monogamous with 
Isla.

1539
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:52,403
I did all this and I have like a from 
rough estimate in my head and obviously 

1540
01:12:57,031 --> 01:13:01,950
that accountant has not given up,
but I'm around 10.

1541
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,680
I'm not much more high.
Higher above that.

1542
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:12,720
Why don't you just guess that is where I
know I'm saying changes every five years

1543
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:16,820
when I asked how I'm out there.
I think so.

1544
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,120
Yeah,
I think so.

1545
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:18,850
No,
it is.

1546
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:19,480
It is.
It is.

1547
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,820
It is.
It's like it's.

1548
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:21,773
I think it's like,
I think it's somewhere between 14 and 

1549
01:13:24,211 --> 01:13:25,920
19.
You know what I'm saying?

1550
01:13:25,921 --> 01:13:27,410
That's a big difference.
Well,

1551
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,253
I guess you do have some.
There are some weekends in college and 

1552
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:35,250
my cognitive thing is there are some you
forget for sure there are.

1553
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:36,650
How are you forgetting who you are?
Jacket,

1554
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:40,830
hooking up with people you're in 
relationships with and I didn't want to.

1555
01:13:40,831 --> 01:13:42,540
I wanted it to be like,
what's up bitch?

1556
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,730
Just take her back.
I get it.

1557
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:45,733
But I already crunched the numbers.
I really thought about it one day and I 

1558
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:50,490
was like,
oh yeah,

1559
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,333
there was no.

1560
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:58,220
They were all almost all bad by the way.
I feel like random hooking up was always

1561
01:13:58,591 --> 01:14:00,240
just so fucking.
It wasn't.

1562
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:05,310
I'm not built for dating.
I'm a monogamous all the way.

1563
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:09,510
I could not survive in today's like 
disposable human.

1564
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,470
Like swiping left.
We actually,

1565
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,600
we can make a loop there.
I think we could probably figure it out.

1566
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,340
Jesus.
So done.

1567
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,200
I'm sorry.
Um,

1568
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,000
I think maybe though.
I think we can.

1569
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,400
I think I really do think it's like 15 
or something,

1570
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:28,020
but I just haven't really hammered.
It's nothing crazy man.

1571
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,430
50 pluses.
We're no,

1572
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,540
wait,
what's your number?

1573
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,700
We didn't endorse.
It's very small.

1574
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:36,250
Very small.
Like less than five.

1575
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,293
No,
that's good.

1576
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:39,040
Oh wait,
how many?

1577
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:44,080
It's a three.
So interesting.

1578
01:14:44,081 --> 01:14:46,900
I know me and another one,
but I don't know if it was the third one

1579
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:47,734
is.
Well now you have your own to tyler 

1580
01:14:51,551 --> 01:14:52,750
problem.
I'm curious,

1581
01:14:52,751 --> 01:14:53,900
but it's not a.

1582
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,060
we'll talk about it.
We'll talk about it later.

1583
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:01,420
Now I'm pissed actually.
I know about him.

1584
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,580
What's your number?
It's under 10.

1585
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,040
Which the number you gave me shit about 
none.

1586
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:14,240
Same thing for freshman numbers.
Last time I had a new fresh deck.

1587
01:15:14,351 --> 01:15:18,740
It's wet now for 14.
Rusty and ashy.

1588
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:23,470
I will say this.
I will give you credit for this.

1589
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:25,720
You know their names.
I know their names.

1590
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:28,840
I know who they are.
I would say 85 percent.

1591
01:15:28,841 --> 01:15:30,610
I don't know their name.
That's weird.

1592
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,840
I know.
80 five percent.

1593
01:15:31,841 --> 01:15:32,674
I wouldn't know their name.
Know because I find is like a short 

1594
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:36,603
Asian fault.
Like I know that stuff about them but I 

1595
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:39,664
don't know anything else are crazy.
But looking back I think a lot of like 

1596
01:15:45,131 --> 01:15:47,550
the one night stands I had was just like
a,

1597
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,143
you know what it is,
is that I was always looking for 

1598
01:15:51,941 --> 01:15:56,941
monogamy but it was always just almost 
like a confidence thing.

1599
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,030
I'm secure and you just want to be like,
feel desirable.

1600
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:04,360
This is why we are fucking one.
I'm exactly the same.

1601
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,710
I'm serious.
Yeah,

1602
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:07,570
I'm exactly the same.
I was the same way,

1603
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:13,110
I was looking for a relationship and 
lack the confidence to insecure and then

1604
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:14,531
I would just,
you know,

1605
01:16:14,531 --> 01:16:17,200
do that and then half the time I swear 
to you,

1606
01:16:17,201 --> 01:16:18,034
I was,
you'd think I was the guy that was like 

1607
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,940
hooking up later.
I was like,

1608
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:23,920
what are you doing later?
And then the girl would be like,

1609
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,230
Ugh,
like going home,

1610
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,110
like I don't want to hang out with.
You played it real cool with me.

1611
01:16:29,111 --> 01:16:32,410
Then what do you mean you weren't,
you weren't like that with me.

1612
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,310
What are you talking about?
I was the one that was like,

1613
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:37,210
c'mon,
let's do it.

1614
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,520
Yeah,
because you were like a total slu tea,

1615
01:16:39,521 --> 01:16:42,520
but I was not really,
that's not what that means.

1616
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:43,720
I it,
I said no,

1617
01:16:43,721 --> 01:16:47,800
she was a triple dsl.
But when I met her and then I was like,

1618
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:49,361
you were,
you were like,

1619
01:16:49,361 --> 01:16:50,260
let's smash.
Come on.

1620
01:16:50,261 --> 01:16:52,520
Stop being a bitch.
That as she dick,

1621
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,093
he was supposed to be my first one night
stand because I was just out of 

1622
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,790
relationship of four years and I said,
I'm going to finally do this.

1623
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:01,220
Everyone else has been doing.
Yeah,

1624
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:04,750
I'm going to just fuck a person that I 
think is cute and just move on with it.

1625
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,870
So he was supposed to be a one night 
stand and I just liked him too much.

1626
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,733
That's great.

1627
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:14,090
Grateful poet.
Bounce.

1628
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:16,790
I threw some really good day.
Then I was really.

1629
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:20,390
I was really giving it to you.
It was performing.

1630
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:23,150
Where are you really?
And you concur.

1631
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:23,661
You were like,
oh,

1632
01:17:23,661 --> 01:17:25,580
that was a good one.
I liked him so much.

1633
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:29,960
He was great in bed and he was great.
Here's the thing.

1634
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:31,410
I was 25.
Yeah.

1635
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:37,240
I was really there for longer.
I think he's even cuter.

1636
01:17:37,241 --> 01:17:42,241
I think you're cuter now more than ever.
You don't ever say I'm cute.

1637
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,800
I don't hear as smashing the Isa.
Isa.

1638
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:53,480
You're the cutest.
That's more dead.

1639
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:56,660
Come on.
Tell them I say that.

1640
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,630
How cute do you think it's okay though?
I,

1641
01:17:59,631 --> 01:18:01,610
I,
I'm secured enough.

1642
01:18:01,611 --> 01:18:04,100
Now.
I do require a little coddling.

1643
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:06,670
I do want a little affirmation.
Uh,

1644
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:09,130
you know,
but I'm okay.

1645
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,540
I require a lie.
I would like a lot.

1646
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:14,090
I can see you and I are similar that 
way.

1647
01:18:14,091 --> 01:18:15,370
Where I,
I liked the praise.

1648
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,360
I like the peds,
I want it all,

1649
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:22,590
but I get by on what I know that person,
but I,

1650
01:18:22,591 --> 01:18:23,960
I lay it on you,
right?

1651
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:25,140
I give it to you.
Right?

1652
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,660
And you like it.
Let's do this.

1653
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:31,340
This really interesting because you give
what you like.

1654
01:18:31,341 --> 01:18:33,890
I love your kid.
I mean what I say and I want you to feel

1655
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:35,210
good and happy,
but uh,

1656
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,590
I want to hear that.
I'm cute.

1657
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:38,420
Okay.
Can we?

1658
01:18:38,421 --> 01:18:41,450
Maybe.
So now we're waiting.

1659
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:44,990
So how,
how do I look?

1660
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:54,060
How do you show them that you love?
What's your coffee in the morning?

1661
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:02,123
I'm defending.
She wants me to coffee and that's very 

1662
01:19:04,131 --> 01:19:06,260
sweet always.
But sometimes I go downstairs,

1663
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:08,000
I make it and I'm bringing it up.
First of all,

1664
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:09,920
I want to clarify that you're not doing 
this everyday.

1665
01:19:09,921 --> 01:19:10,754
Isla isn't going down to cooking 
breakfast and like taking care of 

1666
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:15,050
sometimes and sometimes it's me by the 
way.

1667
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:15,884
I just want to make this picture clear.
Sometimes he'll surprise me with coffee 

1668
01:19:20,481 --> 01:19:22,120
in the morning.
I think that's very sweet.

1669
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:25,160
I appreciate that.
I remember when she used to do that.

1670
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,310
She didn't say it was good before we had
the second baby.

1671
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,233
I was bringing you coffee,
but then I got to run down to that 

1672
01:19:34,491 --> 01:19:35,890
second baby.
I think you look Super Fox.

1673
01:19:35,891 --> 01:19:38,900
Who was like my glasses,
my mom eyes.

1674
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:41,870
I like it a lot.
This is great.

1675
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:42,943
I do.
This is like the Valentine's Day 

1676
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:49,860
episodes,
but I have to say Tom's been doing.

1677
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:56,090
He will make marital love and then he'll
be like,

1678
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,930
I didn't fart that whole time.
You usually drink sex?

1679
01:19:58,970 --> 01:19:59,840
No,
I never do,

1680
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:04,310
but I'm saying sometimes I look for a 
little bit of approval for doing that.

1681
01:20:04,311 --> 01:20:05,144
Like I'll be like,
do you realize that I had to Fart the 

1682
01:20:06,021 --> 01:20:07,690
whole time and I didn't know.
No,

1683
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:08,040
not

1684
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,340
right away,
but a few minutes later.

1685
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:10,993
Oh yeah.
I feel like I would fart what I feel 

1686
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:16,134
like I would because I have a personal.
It's a principle that I will never hold 

1687
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:23,490
a car.
I will never hold a fart.

1688
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,113
Yeah,
but you said you like you didn't even 

1689
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:28,640
know I was starting there and no,
I haven't noticed too far.

1690
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,570
Well,
I don't remember specific times,

1691
01:20:30,571 --> 01:20:33,090
but I don't.
I on principle do not hold farson.

1692
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:36,520
I think it's a good move to hold them in
probably during sex.

1693
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,490
So you think you would just let it go?
Yeah,

1694
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:40,770
really think she'd be like,
hey man,

1695
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,030
maybe let's take a break.

1696
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:45,710
Well,
so far pay.

1697
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,620
No,
not even a sex break for a second.

1698
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:51,060
And she'd be like,
let's air this thing out.

1699
01:20:51,061 --> 01:20:52,550
Let's pick this up next week.
Yeah,

1700
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:57,870
go back to your jerking once a day.
I know it is.

1701
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,270
Yeah.
I don't know if I.

1702
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:02,060
I'm just saying that I.
I generally am not.

1703
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:06,300
I'm against holding cards.
I choose my principle in life.

1704
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:11,900
One of my guiding principles,
timelines it when I buy him stuff.

1705
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,590
You like presence,
right?

1706
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:16,050
He's right though because what else do I
do a lot?

1707
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:18,330
I give you presence.
You liked what?

1708
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:21,180
You get a gift giver.
I love giving gifts.

1709
01:21:21,181 --> 01:21:22,110
Really?
Yeah.

1710
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,033
I always,
I've always been a gift giving and I 

1711
01:21:25,201 --> 01:21:27,270
guess that is true.
It's like you're kind of saying like,

1712
01:21:27,271 --> 01:21:30,560
hey,
why don't you give me something new,

1713
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:32,150
what you do,
what you will,

1714
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:36,270
but that is a good relationship tip for 
everyone watching.

1715
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,133
If you're with your significant other,
see what they do for you when they're 

1716
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,740
being nice.
That's what they want.

1717
01:21:40,741 --> 01:21:41,670
That's what they want.
Yeah.

1718
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,190
You want me to bring a coffee?
Right?

1719
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:47,750
I want you to bring me coffee to.
All right.

1720
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,150
No worries.
That's all you.

1721
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:53,130
But I have to say,
I do love being monogamous.

1722
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,473
I love and I can share this sentiment 
with you guys because you guys are the 

1723
01:21:57,481 --> 01:21:59,200
greatest.
But um,

1724
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:00,173
I love so much.
Being in a good monogamous relationship 

1725
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:05,550
is the best.
It's amazing.

1726
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,400
I wouldn't,
I don't know how to funk.

1727
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:12,810
I mean,
I was obviously single before that and I

1728
01:22:12,811 --> 01:22:14,300
don't think it was for me,
you know,

1729
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,830
I really don't.
I think um,

1730
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:17,423
but I feel much more grounded and normal
and everything in a committed 

1731
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:26,040
relationship literally.
And even more so with babies and stuff.

1732
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:29,430
I was going to say that actually it 
wasn't until we had children.

1733
01:22:29,431 --> 01:22:31,520
I think that you really,
you,

1734
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:35,890
I just see you really happy now.
Like Alice,

1735
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:38,680
our son is almost three years old and 
you know,

1736
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:41,430
they play together.
It's the cutest thing ever.

1737
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,260
It's really nice.
It's really fun.

1738
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:44,590
It's really fun.
Yeah.

1739
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,003
I mean,
what is dance has stopped futzing with 

1740
01:22:49,801 --> 01:22:50,910
your mic.
It keeps going.

1741
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,340
Hi.
What do you.

1742
01:22:53,341 --> 01:22:58,341
All of a sudden my grandma bought some,
but um,

1743
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:01,020
yeah,
it's the best.

1744
01:23:01,021 --> 01:23:03,520
Monogamy is the best thing.
I remembered the cricket.

1745
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,740
Cricket,
right.

1746
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:05,980
Let's

1747
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,980
let people know.
So a cricket obviously is,

1748
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:16,780
it's cold as Jesus.
It's so fucking mean to drop.

1749
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:17,890
I mean,
you know,

1750
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:20,210
it's funny among friends but I'm saying 
in real life to do,

1751
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:21,190
to do quick,
they'll do that.

1752
01:23:21,191 --> 01:23:22,570
Like on,
on radio,

1753
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,010
somebody bombs,
you know,

1754
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:24,873
like that's,
that's like that's me reeling in that 

1755
01:23:27,731 --> 01:23:29,320
moment that,
that feel bad.

1756
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,610
Oh yeah.
It feels bad,

1757
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:31,630
right?
The universal.

1758
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:32,800
Your bombing.
Yeah.

1759
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:37,950
So I was working at a comedy club and to
be like real clear,

1760
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:42,040
like the comics are obviously separate 
from all staff.

1761
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:43,203
Like there's no such thing really as 
staff unless there's a long history 

1762
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,863
getting in on the joking right.
And there was this guy and he wasn't 

1763
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:55,083
very good and he was trying to stand up 
definitely later than he should have 

1764
01:23:59,141 --> 01:24:01,690
been trying,
but he started at like,

1765
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:04,703
I know he,
he started at like in like he was a 

1766
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:08,710
corporate guy,
let me talk in like a suit,

1767
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:09,880
you know,
and he's,

1768
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:10,713
and he's,
and he's,

1769
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:12,460
he's all of a sudden gets this thing I 
want to do,

1770
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:16,120
stand up and he works out a deal where 
like these clubs,

1771
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:16,983
he would do provide some service like on
the business side and then they would 

1772
01:24:20,531 --> 01:24:22,420
let him host shows.

1773
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,160
It was a bad deal for both.

1774
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:27,750
So that's almost a betrayal to him 
because you cut,

1775
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,220
earned that.
Exactly.

1776
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:29,830
Doom.

1777
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:30,663
That was really weird.
He was taking spots from like working 

1778
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,310
comics.
It was weird.

1779
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:37,840
So I do a weekend where he is hosting 
the show and he's,

1780
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:39,880
I mean you look,
he's not the worst but he's just not.

1781
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:40,783
It's not good and you can tell it's 
probably isn't going to pan out and the 

1782
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:45,693
the Dj,
the sound guy from the Dj booth during 

1783
01:24:49,691 --> 01:24:53,740
this guy set in front of a packed house,

1784
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:58,710
the guy would hit a joke and the Dj 
would play crickets and I was,

1785
01:24:58,711 --> 01:25:02,660
oh my God,
my brain loaded.

1786
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:04,170
I was like,
what are you doing?

1787
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:05,123
Because it was so cruel and like,
but also like kind of ballsy like the 

1788
01:25:09,001 --> 01:25:12,360
guy in a weird way.
It didn't deserve that he deserved being

1789
01:25:12,361 --> 01:25:13,194
fucked with.
But like the whole thing is burned into 

1790
01:25:15,901 --> 01:25:18,800
my memory because I also felt for him 
onstage.

1791
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,450
I'm like,
you can't do that to him,

1792
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:23,460
but that's how much.
He was like,

1793
01:25:23,461 --> 01:25:25,290
Oh fuck you man.
He was like,

1794
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,133
he snapped back and I was like,
I remember I was sitting in the 

1795
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:29,323
bathroom.
I'm like,

1796
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:31,370
I've never seen that.
I've never seen the fence.

1797
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,950
I've never seen the guy be like,
fuck this comment.

1798
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,210
Wow,
hit hit the crickets.

1799
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,550
Well,
welcome to the podcast,

1800
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,393
but he goes,
crooked car smashes me with that at 

1801
01:25:42,271 --> 01:25:44,830
least several times,
but I liked that between you guys.

1802
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:45,664
So that I can do it too,
like I guess that would be insane if we 

1803
01:25:50,281 --> 01:25:52,090
didn't tell you guys are,
well we're,

1804
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:52,983
we're friendly.
But like say it's just some random 

1805
01:25:55,381 --> 01:25:56,214
person.
You're like,

1806
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:57,700
you're just like,
yeah.

1807
01:25:57,701 --> 01:26:01,110
And then we,
I should test that out.

1808
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:02,700
It's a quick.
You could,

1809
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:03,890
you could really

1810
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:07,100
go wrong sensibility with that person.
It could be like,

1811
01:26:07,101 --> 01:26:08,570
you know what,
this was nice meeting you guys.

1812
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:10,580
Absolutely.
Walk out.

1813
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:12,043
You guys as comics.
Definitely have an aversion to the 

1814
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:15,320
crickets though.
Yeah man.

1815
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:19,460
For sure.
I feel better if that wasn't an option.

1816
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:20,640
Yeah,
take that off.

1817
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:29,140
If you've taken a shit today or not.
I just do it.

1818
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:34,500
I know I've had to shit for a couple of 
hours but I can always sitting on it.

1819
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:40,080
So it helped find that shitting.
That should be your twitter.

1820
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:41,863
So let me tell you guys some.
I have some new shitting updates of all 

1821
01:26:45,681 --> 01:26:46,750
of our,
of our.

1822
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:50,450
So I was taking metamucil,
which is a,

1823
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:52,160
as you know,
you know what metamucil?

1824
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:54,163
Yes.
Yep.

1825
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:59,740
And so I ran into the metamucil and I 
started taking costco a generic why?

1826
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:03,980
Because it was there.
What does it matter?

1827
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:07,280
Well,
hold on your conclusions because since I

1828
01:27:07,281 --> 01:27:11,330
started taking these generics,
super turned on right now.

1829
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:17,340
You are cute.
I talked to you about shit or the common

1830
01:27:17,370 --> 01:27:19,460
ground.
What happened with this generic?

1831
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:21,170
Amazing,
amazing,

1832
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:25,640
perfect little nuggets.
I'm talking like strong.

1833
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:29,810
When do you take what time of day?
Usually I'll take two with every meal.

1834
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:32,660
Every meal.
Where you're supposed to take like 20 in

1835
01:27:32,661 --> 01:27:33,494
a day.
You know why it says take five five 

1836
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:40,160
times a day.
I swear to you.

1837
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:42,730
I agree.
It's insane.

1838
01:27:42,731 --> 01:27:44,480
Amount of horse.
I'm just a guy trying to have some clean

1839
01:27:44,481 --> 01:27:47,770
shifts.
What about Coca Cola Cola?

1840
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:50,250
That sounds.
I think it was colon.

1841
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:52,000
No,
it's a stool softener.

1842
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:55,250
You take it after you give birth to 
start the engine again.

1843
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:56,480
Oh,
I mean that's not you.

1844
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:00,290
You're taking too many capsules a day.
That's a lot of fiber.

1845
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,270
All my shit's.
Look fucking fantastic.

1846
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:03,563
Photos of them.
How's the wiping when I should like 

1847
01:28:06,351 --> 01:28:08,570
that?
It's like an hour.

1848
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:11,390
Did you get a lead?
You have a good washlet?

1849
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:12,800
No,
not yet.

1850
01:28:12,801 --> 01:28:14,210
Gotten to that yet,
but I do want to.

1851
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:16,910
I want to total it up.
It's on our list.

1852
01:28:16,911 --> 01:28:21,911
We were doing like a gate and yeah,
we've got a lot of blind not to see.

1853
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:24,950
I got to get some privacy,
man.

1854
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,480
I know I need.
I do,

1855
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:29,390
but I am actually curious when you have 
the baby,

1856
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:34,340
tell me what I have is you have the baby
and then you take the baby home and then

1857
01:28:34,341 --> 01:28:39,341
you're just at home with the baby.
Like baby number two,

1858
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:41,263
baby number two.
So this both times we've lived pretty 

1859
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:48,140
close to the hospital.
You not more than a 10 minute drive.

1860
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:49,013
Really 12 on the drive home.
This time I pulled over just to double 

1861
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:55,810
check because I was like,
all right.

1862
01:28:55,970 --> 01:29:00,650
He was strangled by the seatbelt was so 
small in that car,

1863
01:29:00,651 --> 01:29:01,980
driving from that

1864
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:03,900
with Baden and I'm like,
so wait,

1865
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:05,280
I'm starting to panic.
Gosh,

1866
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,050
yeah,
yeah.

1867
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:09,670
They're like this.
That's the case.

1868
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,560
You have an accident or anything?
Oh yeah.

1869
01:29:11,561 --> 01:29:14,250
You pack them in there and at the first 
kid,

1870
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,990
the first kid we didn't even know how to
buckle a kid into the car.

1871
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:22,120
We to ask the nurse to come out and help
us in the hospital.

1872
01:29:22,121 --> 01:29:22,660
I'm like,
hi.

1873
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:23,493
You know,
like can you take that baby home and 

1874
01:29:25,751 --> 01:29:28,360
you're sleep deprived already because 
you've been giving.

1875
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,273
You gave birth 24,
48 hours before and now you've got this 

1876
01:29:31,811 --> 01:29:33,340
being.
And we did shifts.

1877
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:34,443
It's so terrifying.
I remember we were watching a star wars 

1878
01:29:37,031 --> 01:29:37,660
movie.

1879
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:38,560
Yeah.
And we,

1880
01:29:38,561 --> 01:29:39,394
uh,
it was like six days later and we were 

1881
01:29:42,071 --> 01:29:44,530
15 minutes into the movie,
we would walk.

1882
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,413
Then you'd think I'm gonna wash it and 
you've watched like a minute you're 

1883
01:29:46,661 --> 01:29:47,161
like,
oh my God,

1884
01:29:47,161 --> 01:29:47,994
you just.
And then you'd wake up because the baby 

1885
01:29:49,811 --> 01:29:51,030
woke up and then,
you know,

1886
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,660
it'd be like 3:30
and she'd be like,

1887
01:29:52,661 --> 01:29:53,494
go to bed.
I'd go to bed and she'd be on the 

1888
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:55,403
ground.
Were you guys just like off during that 

1889
01:29:57,641 --> 01:29:58,474
time?
It was kind of great because it was 

1890
01:30:00,491 --> 01:30:01,360
December.

1891
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:03,330
Yeah,
near December 14th.

1892
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:05,450
I came to Ellis.
So it was right before the holidays.

1893
01:30:05,451 --> 01:30:06,860
So it was.
It was your birthday you though.

1894
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:08,380
It was a nice number.
Twelve is mine,

1895
01:30:08,381 --> 01:30:09,810
but cool.
Yeah,

1896
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:10,803
but you're going to have a summer baby,
which is kind of even better because 

1897
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:13,344
you're not in the cold and flu season.
They read you the don't take the baby 

1898
01:30:15,961 --> 01:30:16,794
end of the mall.
It's gonna catch this airborne diseases 

1899
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,570
and that's nice because in the summer 
the days are longer so it's.

1900
01:30:21,690 --> 01:30:23,950
That's true.
It's going to be easier for you guys.

1901
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,950
We're going to take like two weeks off 
for sure.

1902
01:30:25,951 --> 01:30:27,830
I think it will take longer.
I just hope so.

1903
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:29,470
No,
no.

1904
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:31,740
I'm just going to come in and do the 
podcast or something.

1905
01:30:31,741 --> 01:30:33,180
I don't know.
Is that enough?

1906
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,870
You take as much time as you want.
I'm for you.

1907
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:36,740
I'm wondering.
Well,

1908
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:37,573
I'm gonna run in and I think it'd be fun
to talk to everybody about what's going 

1909
01:30:40,461 --> 01:30:41,930
on.
It's not a big commitment.

1910
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,420
Got some.
I got some ideas for you,

1911
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:49,040
but I'm so I'm very excited to spending 
like just that family time.

1912
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:51,110
It's great.
You'll never get that again.

1913
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:52,750
You know,
especially first baby,

1914
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:54,133
is that the scariest moment?
Like when did that first baby you just 

1915
01:30:56,151 --> 01:30:56,984
bring it home.
You're like,

1916
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:58,490
I'm terrified of that.
Like,

1917
01:30:58,491 --> 01:30:59,260
seriously.

1918
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,093
Well here's what you can do to help.
If you have a mom who you want to have 

1919
01:31:03,701 --> 01:31:05,620
around you.
Some people don't,

1920
01:31:05,621 --> 01:31:06,454
I didn't it.
So if you don't have a parent or some 

1921
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:10,870
maternal figure that can walk you 
through it,

1922
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:13,930
hire someone if you can afford it.
If you can't afford it,

1923
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,180
hire someone.
Hire a Doula.

1924
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:19,810
Somebody who can help you through your 
pregnancy and delivery and bu there just

1925
01:31:19,811 --> 01:31:21,880
to take care of you and that baby and 
your family.

1926
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,013
Because we were lucky we had a girl come
and cook for us a little and help us 

1927
01:31:27,611 --> 01:31:28,450
out,
you know?

1928
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,470
Um,
yeah,

1929
01:31:29,471 --> 01:31:30,920
it's kind of,
you need them all.

1930
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,800
We didn't have any family.
I mean my mom plants too.

1931
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,010
Visit.
But you know,

1932
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,470
for a couple of weeks when would you 
give birth?

1933
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,480
And my mom lives here.
Yeah,

1934
01:31:40,481 --> 01:31:43,390
there is that,
that thing is like the first 90 days.

1935
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,560
That's,
that's best.

1936
01:31:44,561 --> 01:31:45,330
The Harris,
you know,

1937
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:46,090
they,
yeah.

1938
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:46,923
That's what you want to get through it.
Just know that after the first 90 days 

1939
01:31:48,881 --> 01:31:49,714
it gets a lot easier and they turn into 
babies and you start to see personality 

1940
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:55,533
you have.
And you were telling me about the car 

1941
01:31:57,581 --> 01:31:59,020
ride home.
You didn't finish that.

1942
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:00,010
Did you know just

1943
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:00,640
that?
I was,

1944
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,480
I started.
I was like,

1945
01:32:01,481 --> 01:32:02,740
is he all right?
And she was like,

1946
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:04,330
yeah,
he's fine.

1947
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,690
I was like,
I dunno.

1948
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:08,170
And she was like,
do you want to pull over?

1949
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:08,491
I go,
yeah,

1950
01:32:08,491 --> 01:32:10,530
I want to pull over,
pull over.

1951
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:14,320
So I pulled over and I just,
I mean it was like one of those like ocd

1952
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:16,390
kind of things where you're like,
did I,

1953
01:32:16,391 --> 01:32:18,370
did I lock the door?
And I locked the door.

1954
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,510
Like it was like that.
I just,

1955
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:20,111
you know,
I was like,

1956
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:20,680
yeah,
he's all right.

1957
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:23,110
I just had to double check even though,
you know.

1958
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:24,280
Yeah,
yeah.

1959
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:25,870
Pull over real quick.
Yeah,

1960
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:27,040
sure.
That's a thing.

1961
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:30,640
So you spend the night in the hospital 
for a day or two.

1962
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:33,870
So it depends on the delivery.
Do you have an easy peasy,

1963
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,590
you know,
whatever delivery,

1964
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:37,673
delivery,
delivery it comes out if a blaster your 

1965
01:32:39,301 --> 01:32:41,250
vehicle and uh,
and it,

1966
01:32:41,251 --> 01:32:42,084
and there's no complications.
You can be out of the hospital within 

1967
01:32:44,041 --> 01:32:45,450
like 48 hours.
Right?

1968
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:46,673
If you have a c section,
they might keep you there from like 

1969
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,980
three to five days from what I 
understand.

1970
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,330
Wow.
So it's a lot.

1971
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:53,300
They monitor you because they want to 
make sure,

1972
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:55,500
you know,
there's no internal bleeding or problems

1973
01:32:55,501 --> 01:32:58,410
with you and the baby.
It just depends on how easy it is.

1974
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,900
Pretty incredible how one would just 
used to fucking die.

1975
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:05,910
Oh yeah.
It's terrifying.

1976
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:07,530
Oh,
and then what happened was women used to

1977
01:33:07,531 --> 01:33:12,531
deliver before the discovery of soap and
washing your hands between delivery.

1978
01:33:12,781 --> 01:33:13,614
Women would die on the birthing table 
because physicians didn't know to wash 

1979
01:33:16,621 --> 01:33:19,920
their hands going in there.
Do you mind if I finger you?

1980
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:21,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

1981
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:24,240
It's crazy.
I can't imagine.

1982
01:33:24,241 --> 01:33:24,740
I like him.

1983
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:27,000
Like now having a baby.
We don't,

1984
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:30,010
we don't assume that it's risky.
Gender or,

1985
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:31,240
or life threatening.
Yeah,

1986
01:33:31,850 --> 01:33:32,540
gender.
Right.

1987
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:36,080
We'd always done it that way.
Don't ever assume a gender are you?

1988
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:36,973
I haven't.
I had an idea for a funny youtube video 

1989
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:40,010
and I'm going to.
I don't think I'm going to do it,

1990
01:33:40,011 --> 01:33:42,440
but I'm going to tell you guys the idea.
We were going to do it.

1991
01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:43,760
You know how people do these,
uh,

1992
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:47,300
gender reveals the balloons and pink and
the blue.

1993
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,680
So when we found out the gender,
I was going to do a video on our youtube

1994
01:33:51,681 --> 01:33:55,160
channel and the balloons pop and it's 
white and I look at the camera.

1995
01:33:55,161 --> 01:33:57,310
Go.
How dare you expect me to,

1996
01:33:57,810 --> 01:34:00,350
to assume that gender my baby.
Shame on.

1997
01:34:01,490 --> 01:34:03,460
I liked it.
I thought it'd be vetoed.

1998
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:04,850
No,
I can't.

1999
01:34:04,850 --> 01:34:05,940
Should I start like that?
Funny.

2000
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:06,823
I feel like it's really now.
I thought it had been such a great two 

2001
01:34:09,551 --> 01:34:11,720
minute.
Little cute little one.

2002
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:14,490
How dare you,
how dare you sick.

2003
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:16,070
You're the pro.
You're everything wrong.

2004
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:17,103
Well,
now are you the kind of people that 

2005
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:21,760
you're gonna wait until you have it to 
know the gender or do you want to know?

2006
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:23,080
I always wanted to

2007
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:26,710
the thing too,
because you see couples in the,

2008
01:34:27,290 --> 01:34:28,123
in the,
uh,

2009
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:33,160
in the hospital posing with the baby,
I always fantasize that in the room,

2010
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:34,544
next door was like a black family and 
that I was allowed that they would let 

2011
01:34:37,521 --> 01:34:38,354
me

2012
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:41,130
close,
but be like,

2013
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:46,180
really disappointed dude.
Definitely somebody else.

2014
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:49,100
Let me tell you,
I had a lactation consultant,

2015
01:34:49,101 --> 01:34:49,934
that's another thing.
And they come around and make sure 

2016
01:34:51,531 --> 01:34:54,860
you're eating well and squeeze and 
squeeze those tits.

2017
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:58,050
Slap.
Okay.

2018
01:34:59,050 --> 01:35:01,340
And she told me that she goes today at a
pretty crazy day.

2019
01:35:01,341 --> 01:35:01,881
I go,
what happened?

2020
01:35:01,881 --> 01:35:04,250
She goes,
the baby came out and it wasn't the same

2021
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:07,850
color as both the parents.
Absolutely.

2022
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,160
Absolutely.
And so they did that.

2023
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:11,103
Yeah.
They did a paternity test for that in 

2024
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,470
our children.
They look like you.

2025
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:23,640
The older boy looks just like you say 
you ask for paternity.

2026
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,650
Yeah.
When I was,

2027
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:25,483
I was like,
this guy looks just like you don't see 

2028
01:35:26,271 --> 01:35:27,104
any me in this system.
Since David fucked up things in the 

2029
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:36,850
world though,
a woman like raises someone else's dudes

2030
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:39,790
child.
We imagine being like actively less.

2031
01:35:39,791 --> 01:35:44,390
The thing is like for that lady,
possibly she was actively probably,

2032
01:35:44,391 --> 01:35:45,630
let's say,
trying to get pregnant.

2033
01:35:45,631 --> 01:35:46,420
I was like,
oh,

2034
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:48,680
I'll just hop on one other dixie.
What happens there too?

2035
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:54,010
That has been cheating like that.
I guess it's got to happen both ways,

2036
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:58,160
but she had to know that there was a 
chance that was gonna be a black baby.

2037
01:35:58,790 --> 01:35:59,780
She's like,
please God,

2038
01:35:59,781 --> 01:36:03,470
please don't tell you that.
No,

2039
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:05,010
no,
no.

2040
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:09,200
The doctor is like,
you've got a black baby during delivery.

2041
01:36:09,201 --> 01:36:10,370
I'm sure.
It's like everyone's like,

2042
01:36:10,371 --> 01:36:10,911
oh,
right,

2043
01:36:10,911 --> 01:36:12,050
and they're like cheered,
and then they're like,

2044
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:14,210
oh,
why is it so quiet?

2045
01:36:18,530 --> 01:36:19,363
But all the little things,
like when we had the first ultrasound 

2046
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:21,853
that doctors like we can do screening or
with new invasive testing or we put a 

2047
01:36:24,921 --> 01:36:28,340
needle and we squeezed and I was like,
Whoa,

2048
01:36:28,341 --> 01:36:28,830
Whoa,
whoa,

2049
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:31,700
don't do blood.
No,

2050
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:33,080
they can do it.
It's amazing.

2051
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:35,690
What he said is this.
I was like,

2052
01:36:35,691 --> 01:36:37,010
well,
why would I want to do that?

2053
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:42,240
The screening is 95 percent certain and 
then I guess the invasive testing is 90.

2054
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,360
Is it certain?
I'll take the.

2055
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:48,910
Yeah,
but there's even,

2056
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:50,300
it's expensive,
but there's,

2057
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:53,390
there's blood tests now that the 
screening is unbelief.

2058
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,770
They could do it within 10 days.
I wouldn't,

2059
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:56,601
I give,
given that option.

2060
01:36:56,601 --> 01:37:01,130
Was it like ridiculous?
It's called Tara.

2061
01:37:01,970 --> 01:37:05,270
That's what we had.
I think you're on 12 weeks or 14 weeks.

2062
01:37:05,271 --> 01:37:06,104
They do,
they take like 15 vials of blood can 

2063
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:10,160
tell you everything,
man.

2064
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:14,700
I'm to color their pubes are going to be
in this basement,

2065
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:17,760
will have red pubes aboard.
Oh,

2066
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:18,613
that was another fun one.
If you have like a fun doctor where you 

2067
01:37:21,231 --> 01:37:22,300
can ask,
uh,

2068
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:23,180
you know,
I'm like,

2069
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,830
so what happens?
Because they go through,

2070
01:37:24,831 --> 01:37:26,360
you know,
oh,

2071
01:37:26,361 --> 01:37:27,194
your test came back and there's no 
genetic markers for anything that you 

2072
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:32,150
would worry about.
And I'm like,

2073
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:35,570
so how often do people flush?
And he's like,

2074
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:36,500
well,
you know,

2075
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:40,520
happens sometimes it's for something 
like really serious,

2076
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:41,533
like we'll tell them this is like a 
major genetic defect because like 

2077
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:49,670
sometimes it'll be like not a health 
threat will be like,

2078
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:50,300
you know,
I don't know,

2079
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:53,840
like an extra finger yet.
There'll be like,

2080
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:55,440
just abort it.
And he's like,

2081
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:56,370
are you sure?
They're like,

2082
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:56,591
yeah,
yeah,

2083
01:37:56,591 --> 01:37:58,410
yeah.
They're like,

2084
01:37:58,440 --> 01:37:59,960
Nah,
it's too weird.

2085
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:03,390
He tells me.
That's crazy.

2086
01:38:03,730 --> 01:38:06,990
That is.
So the thing is he's got a big ear lobe.

2087
01:38:06,991 --> 01:38:08,430
They're like,
why don't you flush that out?

2088
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:10,800
That we'll start over,
don't want.

2089
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:11,693
Oh my God.
That's how some people are color the 

2090
01:38:13,291 --> 01:38:15,630
eyes.
Brown Brown.

2091
01:38:15,631 --> 01:38:20,631
Like my shit.
Like when I Shit actually what's working

2092
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:25,710
the most likely have blue eyed babies 
because Eli has blue eyes and my dad has

2093
01:38:25,711 --> 01:38:27,990
blue eyes.
That doesn't that mean 75 percent.

2094
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:30,120
I don't know.
I forget how that shit works.

2095
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:34,080
I'm alerted in 10th grade because the 
pool is recessive,

2096
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:39,390
but it's so dominant because the brown 
always wins out.

2097
01:38:39,391 --> 01:38:40,890
But there's a.
You know what?

2098
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,020
If she has blue,
blue,

2099
01:38:43,021 --> 01:38:43,471
blue,
blue,

2100
01:38:43,471 --> 01:38:44,610
blue,
and her line,

2101
01:38:44,990 --> 01:38:45,823
then that becomes dominant.
I'm assuming your dad didn't have blue 

2102
01:38:48,241 --> 01:38:50,190
eyes.
He had like Hazel Brown,

2103
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:52,463
Hazel.
I know that blue light angels have blue 

2104
01:38:54,781 --> 01:38:57,540
eyes.
And I know that blue angels,

2105
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:02,970
blue angels had fluid like a tough biker
gang eyes.

2106
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:07,500
You guys want to rob this place?
Let me see your eyes.

2107
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:10,530
Your doctor.
You trust your doctor and stuff.

2108
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:13,950
Um,
and I don't know.

2109
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:16,260
It's like a new dog there.
He seemed cool,

2110
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:20,430
some cool,
but I don't have a background with him.

2111
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:22,910
Kaiser.
Okay.

2112
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:26,340
He seemed nice though.
He got,

2113
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:28,190
he had a nice little joke.
He was like,

2114
01:39:28,191 --> 01:39:29,024
uh,
I've been doing this for 12 years and 

2115
01:39:31,081 --> 01:39:33,240
you could trust me when I say it.
You are pregnant.

2116
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:36,240
Oh Jesus Christ.
Well,

2117
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:37,123
if you don't like him,
definitely now's the time to judge 

2118
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:42,840
because he's going to be with you at one
of the craziest moments of your life.

2119
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:45,690
But if you don't,
who does the delivery part?

2120
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:46,753
Your ob really generally.
But there is a possibility that your ob 

2121
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:53,313
would not be an extensible,
but most likely they'll know what 

2122
01:39:57,541 --> 01:39:58,780
they're doing.
Yeah,

2123
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:04,820
I figure but he will have the,
a front row seat to the front row seat.

2124
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:11,970
Did you don't see that deal?
What the everything.

2125
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:13,813
I mean the like the act,
the badge blessed when the grenade went 

2126
01:40:17,281 --> 01:40:21,690
off and watching that exact moment.
But like I watched that thing,

2127
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:22,973
you know,
I watched the air pump into it and I 

2128
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:28,380
watched it swell,
like air pumping because when you start,

2129
01:40:28,381 --> 01:40:32,100
when the baby starts coming out right 
there,

2130
01:40:32,101 --> 01:40:32,934
you see pressure forming down there and 
then you see after a while you just see 

2131
01:40:36,091 --> 01:40:38,250
hair coming out.
It's the scalp,

2132
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:41,820
like the babies and then you see it push
through a little more.

2133
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:43,793
Feel that there's pressure there.
It's like a giant balloon is going like 

2134
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:51,540
up and then.
So I'm like this about to pop.

2135
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,090
I don't want to see the pop was

2136
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:55,750
there.
No,

2137
01:40:55,810 --> 01:40:56,643
not really,
but there is a lot of moments where it 

2138
01:40:58,271 --> 01:41:03,271
finally clears and like all the fluid.
And so let me,

2139
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:04,633
let me pay you your by her side,
like fire head and then you would like 

2140
01:41:07,601 --> 01:41:09,200
peek,
like how does it feel like.

2141
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:11,350
So if a,
her head's here.

2142
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:13,090
Yeah,
there's one leg.

2143
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:15,100
This,
this mic arm is her leg.

2144
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:20,820
I'm holding the leg here and I got her 
foot here in this elbow and leaning back

2145
01:41:21,251 --> 01:41:22,690
with it.
You can take a peek.

2146
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:24,010
Yeah.
So you go like that and you're like,

2147
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,490
oh shit,
everything's good.

2148
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:28,540
You don't feel it.
If you have an epidural,

2149
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:31,390
it doesn't matter.
Whatever you do,

2150
01:41:31,391 --> 01:41:33,640
don't look at my face.
And then the doctor,

2151
01:41:34,650 --> 01:41:35,483
he said,
we can like handfuls of Lube and he's 

2152
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:40,660
like losing the baby up.
No,

2153
01:41:40,661 --> 01:41:42,010
he's,
he's lubing the rim,

2154
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,920
like these luminous.
And he goes and he's like,

2155
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:46,040
oh my goodness.

2156
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,960
I felt like he would push it around the 
baby's hat making,

2157
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:50,853
try to get the hell out so that.
And also just like stretching it cut my 

2158
01:41:55,161 --> 01:41:59,530
badge because it was just so snotty.
And so I have so many questions.

2159
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:00,663
What do you remember from that?
Remember that I got to get some of this 

2160
01:42:05,771 --> 01:42:08,420
to put it.
He took out a bunch of great.

2161
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:14,440
Tom had like this whole deal and there's
a lot going on that you don't remember.

2162
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,750
Do you remember?
Just like lots of pushing.

2163
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,850
I remember everything.
You're not out of it.

2164
01:42:18,851 --> 01:42:20,710
You're not mentally out of it with the 
epidural.

2165
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,880
You're just physically,
physically you're late.

2166
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:24,843
Can't move your legs and stuff.
So they put your legs in stirrups when 

2167
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:30,330
go time now remember everything you just
pushed.

2168
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:32,960
You pushed and lots.
Well they,

2169
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,300
they like to wait until you're at the 
right at the head.

2170
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:36,820
Right?
You know,

2171
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:38,560
right at the very end.
Yeah.

2172
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:40,480
And you just,
you push like you're shitting.

2173
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:44,590
I'm constipated or it's like a good shit
just keeps coming out.

2174
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,590
That's interesting.
No it,

2175
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:47,560
yeah,
it feels like a shit that won't come out

2176
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:48,394
and then all of a sudden like you feel 
the head like he's talking about that 

2177
01:42:51,101 --> 01:42:55,030
moment where the hair and then all of a 
sudden like you feel that pop like that.

2178
01:42:55,730 --> 01:42:59,180
I've had shifts like that and then the 
shoulders and once,

2179
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:01,660
once they turn it and the shoulders come
out of you,

2180
01:43:01,661 --> 01:43:02,494
it just goes boom.
The baby like shoes out of you and you 

2181
01:43:04,571 --> 01:43:08,140
literally just like in a ball in a ball 
and,

2182
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:10,060
and all that shit comes out like you 
said.

2183
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,033
But it's crazy because you feel 
everything come out of you in that 

2184
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:14,223
second year.
Like,

2185
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:18,580
like it's so jarring.
It's unlike anything.

2186
01:43:18,581 --> 01:43:19,414
It's not like taking a shit because it's
literally like your insights are coming 

2187
01:43:22,421 --> 01:43:24,640
out of you and he wants and it's not 
painful.

2188
01:43:24,641 --> 01:43:26,080
I don't mean to scare you.
It's not painful.

2189
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:28,350
It's just,
it's unlike anything else.

2190
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:29,443
Listen,
I went back for a second so it can't be 

2191
01:43:30,521 --> 01:43:32,840
that the baby came.

2192
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:36,370
Oh my God.
You're like,

2193
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:38,380
yeah,
you'll get emotional for sure.

2194
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,890
Why?
I mean,

2195
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:43,630
because you're like my life,
so why do you even care?

2196
01:43:44,450 --> 01:43:45,810
And then,
and then.

2197
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:51,010
So I was gonna say cut your.
So they kept the name of that premium of

2198
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,670
the premium it has showed.
Is there a fun?

2199
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:56,810
Is that what it showed?
Is the skin between the vag called?

2200
01:43:56,811 --> 01:44:00,450
What's it called when they called?
It showed.

2201
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:04,340
It showed ectomy.
So how was the,

2202
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:07,100
how has it healed if you get a to be 
Calamari?

2203
01:44:07,101 --> 01:44:10,820
It's actually.
So here's the deal.

2204
01:44:10,821 --> 01:44:13,190
The first one,
the first one I had,

2205
01:44:13,191 --> 01:44:16,970
it didn't heal great because she 
stitched it up kind of funkily.

2206
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:20,420
So it healed.
It hurt the scar hurt for a long time,

2207
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:21,493
but the second time around I told to my 
doctor about it and then he sewed it up 

2208
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:25,723
perfectly and now I don't even know what
was it you said to the doctor because I 

2209
01:44:27,881 --> 01:44:28,714
want,
I want,

2210
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:33,290
I want to or want to know that I can ask
for it to get.

2211
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:35,840
Make sure you stitched up right?
What did you say to the document?

2212
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:39,050
I said whoever the fuck did it the first
time I fucked it up.

2213
01:44:39,150 --> 01:44:40,720
Say That to tender.
Whatever.

2214
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:44,660
Fuck.
Whoever you want.

2215
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,730
You want to ask if he.
I don't know,

2216
01:44:46,731 --> 01:44:48,270
because you might not need an a Pz 
atomy.

2217
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:51,800
You might be.
You might tear a little bit.

2218
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:54,060
If you do badge,
he might need a csection.

2219
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:57,470
Who knows?
Ask Him if he does a PCI enemies and how

2220
01:44:57,471 --> 01:44:59,450
has the stitching world say what if he's
like,

2221
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:01,250
I'm going to have done them.
I'm not the best,

2222
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:05,570
but we'll do it.
He wants someone talked to women that if

2223
01:45:05,571 --> 01:45:09,530
you can,
that have gone to him or ask women.

2224
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:10,630
Yeah.
That have delivered with.

2225
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:14,700
Yeah.
Well you just get recommended like,

2226
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,090
yeah,
but you're with Kaiser.

2227
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:19,910
Kaiser Shit.
I mean he seems.

2228
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:20,893
He seems nice.

2229
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:22,550
He's a young guy,
which I like.

2230
01:45:22,551 --> 01:45:24,530
He's not like an old fucking guy.
Yeah,

2231
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:27,560
he's probably like 40.
He's Asian.

2232
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:33,950
I realized that of course.
That's interesting.

2233
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:38,810
So he was going to be actually doing the
switch to him then he's gonna yeah,

2234
01:45:38,811 --> 01:45:39,644
I think so.
He'll pop in at the last hour and be 

2235
01:45:40,941 --> 01:45:41,910
like,
alright yeah,

2236
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:42,970
that's.
Oh,

2237
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:43,903
and by the way,
the doctor doesn't come in until the 

2238
01:45:45,501 --> 01:45:46,334
very end.
So you'll be like pushing and you're 

2239
01:45:47,661 --> 01:45:48,930
like,
where the fuck is he?

2240
01:45:48,931 --> 01:45:49,764
And he's in the hallway or her and 
they'll call her and there's that one 

2241
01:45:51,921 --> 01:45:52,880
nurse.
What are the color?

2242
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:54,580
Who's like in charge of the whole thing 
is,

2243
01:45:54,581 --> 01:45:56,000
is there a name for it?
Oh,

2244
01:45:56,001 --> 01:45:58,220
I don't know,
but there's always a nurse with a lot of

2245
01:45:58,221 --> 01:46:00,650
personality.
For some reason we had them twice.

2246
01:46:00,651 --> 01:46:04,550
There's someone who's like shecky greene
and they find out you're a comedian.

2247
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:05,713
It's fucking over.
And Tom and I are not shucky Shucky 

2248
01:46:10,101 --> 01:46:12,700
ducky all the time.
Especially when you're having a child.

2249
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:17,380
Definitely if they ask you what you guys
do like I'm going to count and I,

2250
01:46:17,410 --> 01:46:21,260
oh,
I always usually just say something like

2251
01:46:21,261 --> 01:46:22,094
video production regardless because I 
don't ever want to know what you should 

2252
01:46:24,441 --> 01:46:25,310
do,
but what do I do?

2253
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:26,840
And then just pull up your youtube 
account.

2254
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:29,080
Check this out right here for 
production.

2255
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:32,960
Hashtag Hashtag.
Do you guys like it?

2256
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,810
It's weird.
I avoid it.

2257
01:46:38,811 --> 01:46:40,880
It's also like in the delivery room,
it's like,

2258
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:43,910
it's the worst time also,
you know,

2259
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:46,010
if you're going like,
this is to me,

2260
01:46:46,011 --> 01:46:50,010
this isn't like the loose left moment in
someone's life

2261
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:51,533
and they start working their personality
into you and I do that thing where I 

2262
01:46:54,281 --> 01:46:55,114
just ignore.
I feel them trying to be acknowledged 

2263
01:46:57,301 --> 01:46:57,980
and I'm just like,
yeah,

2264
01:46:57,980 --> 01:47:00,240
I'm not going to acknowledge you.
So I just,

2265
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:01,860
I mean it bothers me,
you know,

2266
01:47:02,130 --> 01:47:02,880
I mean,
you,

2267
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,190
you gotta do what you got it.
Yeah.

2268
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:06,040
Yeah.
I ignored her and,

2269
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:09,720
and in hindsight I should've been like 
someone get fucking shecky greene out of

2270
01:47:09,721 --> 01:47:11,790
my delivery room.
I should've just demanded it,

2271
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:13,440
but I didn't want to be able to.
How did they find out?

2272
01:47:13,441 --> 01:47:14,274
You guys are comedians.
They fucking someone'll tell someone 

2273
01:47:17,011 --> 01:47:20,490
will someone will have one nurse at the 
station will be like,

2274
01:47:20,491 --> 01:47:24,390
that's from the thing and then tell all 
the nurses and the nurses are like,

2275
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:25,253
oh,
we got ourselves a little celebrity 

2276
01:47:26,041 --> 01:47:26,874
here,
Huh?

2277
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:28,913
People I think,
which is what we're looking for when we 

2278
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:32,173
don't think people would ever guess some
entertainer or a comedian because I 

2279
01:47:35,221 --> 01:47:40,221
think I'm really very introverted out in
the.

2280
01:47:41,210 --> 01:47:42,043
It might not guess,
but all you gotta do is have the guy 

2281
01:47:43,891 --> 01:47:48,720
wheeling the meal to somebody's room 
walked by and that's what you think.

2282
01:47:48,721 --> 01:47:50,850
Well,
they go that and people are like,

2283
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:51,900
who the fuck?
What does that mean?

2284
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:52,620
Right.
But then he'll,

2285
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:53,790
he'll be like,
you don't understand,

2286
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:59,400
and then have you not seen vape.
Fucking it'll go from there.

2287
01:47:59,401 --> 01:48:00,234
All of a sudden they'll be like,
we were watching your guys' videos last 

2288
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:03,533
night.
Are you dilated?

2289
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:08,660
And you know which one I didn't like 
hearing criticism.

2290
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:10,440
You'll be like,
thank you.

2291
01:48:10,441 --> 01:48:11,640
I look for.
That's what I wanted right now.

2292
01:48:11,641 --> 01:48:13,470
I look for criticism everywhere.
I can get it.

2293
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:15,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

2294
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,553
Oh,
take a tour of the hospital before you 

2295
01:48:18,151 --> 01:48:20,460
give birth,
like do it in your second trimester when

2296
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:25,461
you're not huge and modeling so you know
what to do when you know the go time and

2297
01:48:26,131 --> 01:48:28,800
early register,
early registration,

2298
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:31,250
then your pants.

2299
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:33,810
What does that mean?
That means like when you actually,

2300
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:34,673
you can go in,
you can register at the hospital for 

2301
01:48:37,231 --> 01:48:39,180
like,
you don't have all your information.

2302
01:48:39,181 --> 01:48:40,290
Here's your name,
address,

2303
01:48:40,291 --> 01:48:41,730
this is your insurance,
everything,

2304
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:43,680
and then there'll be low.
That maternity.

2305
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:46,650
Then when you come in you go like,
we already registered.

2306
01:48:46,651 --> 01:48:47,310
They're like,
oh yeah,

2307
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:49,490
take her up.
Arrive.

2308
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:51,960
And they're like,
fill out everything.

2309
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:55,260
Six.
When we came in I was in labor the first

2310
01:48:55,261 --> 01:48:57,620
kid and they're like,
sit down,

2311
01:48:57,630 --> 01:48:59,250
fill out paperwork,
does she want to do it?

2312
01:48:59,251 --> 01:49:00,270
And I was like,
fuck no,

2313
01:49:00,271 --> 01:49:03,060
like I'm having contractions right now.
Fill out.

2314
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:05,310
They'll like not let people down the 
hall,

2315
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:07,050
you know,
he's all yours.

2316
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:07,711
Wow.
Okay.

2317
01:49:07,711 --> 01:49:08,760
That's a hot tip.
Yeah.

2318
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:11,670
Well I'm excited.
I,

2319
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:12,810
I,
seriously,

2320
01:49:12,811 --> 01:49:13,644
I'm amazed and I'll tell you too,
it's kind of weird because there's life 

2321
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:21,900
before children,
BC and you're like,

2322
01:49:21,901 --> 01:49:22,734
I can't,
I don't even remember what the fuck we 

2323
01:49:23,881 --> 01:49:25,680
did before we had kids right at this 
point.

2324
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:27,030
No,
all that free time.

2325
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:30,480
Does it give you a life for me?
If feel purposeful?

2326
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:31,583
Of course you have to be a total fucking
psycho to not think that I talked to 

2327
01:49:35,221 --> 01:49:37,050
somebody who was like that who I was 
like,

2328
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:38,110
nothing's different,
right?

2329
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:38,953
Like he was like,
I go with your life was meaningless 

2330
01:49:40,471 --> 01:49:41,460
bullshit before.
He's like,

2331
01:49:41,461 --> 01:49:42,161
no,
it wasn't like,

2332
01:49:42,161 --> 01:49:43,860
Oh yes it was.
And he was like,

2333
01:49:43,890 --> 01:49:47,040
why would you say that you have a 
fucking one year old.

2334
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:47,980
You don't understand what

2335
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:51,020
I'm saying.
Like I wasn't meaning it all.

2336
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,000
Yeah.
He was like,

2337
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:53,350
don't be one of those.
I was like,

2338
01:49:53,351 --> 01:49:54,400
dude,
you,

2339
01:49:54,450 --> 01:49:57,330
you now are responsible for someone's 
life you're talking about.

2340
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:58,173
Yeah.

2341
01:50:01,150 --> 01:50:06,150
I just remembered the guy who is telling
us to not have kids to a and Oh my God.

2342
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:10,340
Oh my God,
what a psycho.

2343
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:12,620
This guy,
we went to Sweden.

2344
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,940
We don't know him personally,
but he was like,

2345
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,070
they're a friend of a friend.
How long have you guys fucked?

2346
01:50:19,170 --> 01:50:21,230
He's like away from his family traveling
all the time.

2347
01:50:21,231 --> 01:50:22,100
He's like,
don't have kids,

2348
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:24,740
but at any rate I was like,
okay,

2349
01:50:24,741 --> 01:50:25,720
whatever.
I don't care about you.

2350
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:29,090
I didn't take it seriously in a 
conversation.

2351
01:50:29,091 --> 01:50:29,924
You'll never have like,
I've never heard anyone be like I have 

2352
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:33,163
a.
because like honestly I don't really 

2353
01:50:34,521 --> 01:50:36,310
like them.
Wait,

2354
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,640
Burke told you this.
It was great.

2355
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:42,230
Well,
I will say if you enjoy having a dog and

2356
01:50:42,231 --> 01:50:46,310
I know that a dog and a child is not the
same kind of similar.

2357
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:49,070
Similar why I'm so excited because 
shredder,

2358
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:52,670
like I have so much love for him and 
like I see him as a person.

2359
01:50:52,910 --> 01:50:55,650
He's like the heart and that's,
that's why I'm so excited.

2360
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:56,703
What else?
We also weren't thinking like what was 

2361
01:50:58,191 --> 01:50:59,024
my life before I read it now it's all 
about all you want to walk in all day 

2362
01:51:03,170 --> 01:51:06,710
and that's why I just love.
I've been thinking so much about what it

2363
01:51:06,711 --> 01:51:08,990
is to be apparent.
It's so weird.

2364
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:12,050
It's really such an important kind of 
rite of passage as a person,

2365
01:51:12,051 --> 01:51:12,884
right,
because you have to think about who you 

2366
01:51:14,661 --> 01:51:17,300
are as a person,
that who you want this person to be,

2367
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:19,370
what kind of person do you want to be 
for them,

2368
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:20,293
and the other thing on top of everything
you're saying is you do have those 

2369
01:51:23,061 --> 01:51:23,894
moments where you really start thinking 
about your parents in a different 

2370
01:51:26,901 --> 01:51:28,370
capacity because you're like,
oh,

2371
01:51:28,371 --> 01:51:31,080
they did all this shit.
And then you realize like,

2372
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:32,163
oh,
I think you got a lot of forgiveness 

2373
01:51:33,321 --> 01:51:34,154
because you go like,
they were just trying to get you this 

2374
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:36,703
chair,
you know,

2375
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:38,420
and they,
whatever they messed up,

2376
01:51:38,450 --> 01:51:39,530
they didn't try to mess it up.

2377
01:51:39,690 --> 01:51:41,440
Yeah.
Well you realize how shitty your parents

2378
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:45,690
were saying.
Well,

2379
01:51:45,691 --> 01:51:46,524
yeah,
but I mean they really dropped the ball 

2380
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:50,180
here.
I mean,

2381
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,033
that can happen too if they really.
But it is really amazing how much of a 

2382
01:51:56,081 --> 01:51:56,914
life change it seems.
That will be the biggest thing is I 

2383
01:52:00,161 --> 01:52:03,940
think that sense of responsibility of 
caring for another human being.

2384
01:52:03,941 --> 01:52:07,490
It's transformative.
I can tell you until I,

2385
01:52:07,491 --> 01:52:08,324
at least until I went through it,
I didn't feel like a real adult until 

2386
01:52:11,310 --> 01:52:14,230
you're your everyday you wake up and 
because you're alive.

2387
01:52:14,231 --> 01:52:16,390
That little dudes,
those two dudes were alive,

2388
01:52:16,391 --> 01:52:17,980
you know,
and there's levels to this shit.

2389
01:52:18,450 --> 01:52:20,180
He don't say shit.
Oh,

2390
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:21,330
dog is like,
you know,

2391
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:24,390
there's like getting a job.
Do you remember like when you,

2392
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:25,313
I don't know what if you,
when you remember getting like a 

2393
01:52:26,431 --> 01:52:28,650
retirement account,
you have a retirement account.

2394
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,800
It feels like an adult thing.
Buying a house is like the big thing.

2395
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:32,993
You feel like an adult,
but nothing ever feels as big as being 

2396
01:52:36,271 --> 01:52:41,010
like I have a kid who I'm responsible 
for everything.

2397
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:43,860
That is the most adult move ever.
For sure.

2398
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:46,010
Why is it human nature is so fucked up

2399
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,930
because you're supposed to have a kid at
like 16,

2400
01:52:47,931 --> 01:52:49,010
17,
18,

2401
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:53,030
and then if I had a kid at that age I 
would fucking ruin that kid's life.

2402
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:56,690
But now I feel like we're in a good 
place in our thirties,

2403
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:57,553
early thirties,
but in nature that's kind of like a 

2404
01:53:01,110 --> 01:53:01,943
death wish.
Delicate at that age you're going to 

2405
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:03,440
happen

2406
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:08,440
kid in what?
In college and you'll be fifth.

2407
01:53:08,481 --> 01:53:10,490
I always through the college math.
What you you're like,

2408
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:11,620
oh,
I'll be I kid.

2409
01:53:11,630 --> 01:53:13,280
Well I'll be,
I'll be,

2410
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:14,473
I'll be 49.

2411
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:15,540
That's,
that's pretty good.

2412
01:53:15,541 --> 01:53:17,330
I'll be under 50 when they started 
college.

2413
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:19,050
That's crazy.
That's good.

2414
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:22,570
Right?
We're going to be like with canes.

2415
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:26,430
Well how do you get them when one starts
to college?

2416
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:29,100
So I was 38 when I had ellis.
Right?

2417
01:53:29,101 --> 01:53:32,960
Or 39 when it's already seven year 
difference with either or eight year.

2418
01:53:32,961 --> 01:53:36,180
You're 30 right?
Or you'll be 31.

2419
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:39,570
Yeah.
And now I'm 42.

2420
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:40,553
I was yeah,
I just turned 42 when I had Julian 

2421
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:45,120
second baby.
So I'm old ass Mama.

2422
01:53:45,150 --> 01:53:45,990
No,
but you,

2423
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,073
I feel like.
I do think that you guys are going to 

2424
01:53:50,821 --> 01:53:51,654
be,
are much better parents in a way when 

2425
01:53:53,491 --> 01:53:56,100
you older and you're more secure,
you've been around,

2426
01:53:56,101 --> 01:53:59,630
you have so much more to offer your kid.
Yeah,

2427
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:02,280
that's true.
People losing like younger parents,

2428
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:04,440
not really getting like,
dude,

2429
01:54:04,441 --> 01:54:06,090
if you lose your shit on that kid right 
now,

2430
01:54:06,091 --> 01:54:06,924
that's not really the way to parent.
They soak everything because you're so 

2431
01:54:10,591 --> 01:54:12,240
triggered up and you don't,
you don't know.

2432
01:54:12,241 --> 01:54:14,070
You don't have that experience of life 
to be like,

2433
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:15,060
oh,
this is just a trigger.

2434
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:17,130
This is a childhood thing.
This is a thing.

2435
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:19,740
This isn't about him.
This is about what happened back here.

2436
01:54:20,490 --> 01:54:24,210
You know,
it's a lot of your past and your present

2437
01:54:24,211 --> 01:54:25,320
and everything merges.

2438
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:28,823
Well.
I had been thinking a lot about that 

2439
01:54:29,221 --> 01:54:30,054
stuff since I started therapy because 
it's all about like your family and 

2440
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:36,480
asked and big time and I stuff I never 
thought about before.

2441
01:54:36,481 --> 01:54:39,360
But,
but you seem happier.

2442
01:54:39,361 --> 01:54:40,194
I think you've.
Do you feel better or a little more 

2443
01:54:42,451 --> 01:54:44,400
relief?
Or has it started yet?

2444
01:54:44,650 --> 01:54:46,100
Um,
well I've been doing.

2445
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:50,990
I've been doing as much as I can kind of
have to deal with the depression.

2446
01:54:51,390 --> 01:54:52,223
I started taking antidepressants about.
I haven't said that publicly because 

2447
01:54:55,041 --> 01:54:58,430
that's kind of waiting to see.
I do.

2448
01:54:58,431 --> 01:54:59,264
I did want to talk about it publicly 
because I think it's important for 

2449
01:55:01,071 --> 01:55:05,270
people to know what it is because I had 
such a huge misconception of what it is,

2450
01:55:06,290 --> 01:55:07,123
but I think I've been on it for like two
months now and it definitely helps a 

2451
01:55:10,761 --> 01:55:11,840
lot.
That's great.

2452
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:13,173
Like it's great.
It's great that you made a decision to 

2453
01:55:16,371 --> 01:55:21,371
do that and that it's working well.
I kinda hit a wall where I was like,

2454
01:55:21,731 --> 01:55:24,740
uh,
anything other than this.

2455
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:28,070
I was putting off it for so long ago,
but then I was just like,

2456
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:31,070
you know,
anything other than whatever this is now

2457
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:33,710
and,
but actually it's not,

2458
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:36,680
it's really,
it's really quite subtle.

2459
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:39,750
The first two weeks is really tough 
because you've,

2460
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,890
you feel it and it's confusing and you 
don't know what you're.

2461
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:44,010
And

2462
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:44,843
you feel the side effects a lot.
You can have a headache and you cannot 

2463
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:49,170
sleep well.
And you.

2464
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:51,780
My thing was I was feeling like foggy in
my brain.

2465
01:55:51,781 --> 01:55:52,614
That was super frustrating.
Just like the first couple of weeks on 

2466
01:55:54,911 --> 01:55:55,744
the medication,
starting the meds and then what it kind 

2467
01:55:57,781 --> 01:55:59,040
of just evens out.
Yeah.

2468
01:55:59,041 --> 01:56:01,330
And then I started to feel,
are you okay?

2469
01:56:01,331 --> 01:56:02,164
Are you on a time crunch?
You guys got to bounce and go somewhere 

2470
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:12,060
soon.
It's been a good time.

2471
01:56:12,061 --> 01:56:15,600
It's been such a fantastic.
It's like a real great moment to bring.

2472
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,160
Thank you.
I was really.

2473
01:56:18,870 --> 01:56:20,110
Actually,
this has been a long.

2474
01:56:20,210 --> 01:56:23,760
That's where will see we could.
It wasn't this.

2475
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:25,470
We could have kept talking for over.
Yeah,

2476
01:56:25,471 --> 01:56:26,304
we definitely could have,
but you guys are mommies and daddies as 

2477
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:31,080
I'm,
I'm really happy,

2478
01:56:31,081 --> 01:56:31,800
man.
That,

2479
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:34,950
that you're feeling better and that has 
worked well for you.

2480
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:37,320
I'm still,
I'm still miserable.

2481
01:56:37,510 --> 01:56:38,820
Okay.
I'm still depressed,

2482
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,070
but I'll say this.
And I said it's an the other day.

2483
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:44,280
The difference now is that there's a 
light at the end of the tunnel.

2484
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:46,060
That's great.
That's all it needs to be.

2485
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:46,903
I feel like there's hope and I can see a
way out of it and don't be one of these 

2486
01:56:50,551 --> 01:56:52,530
fucking guys that goes like,
no,

2487
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:55,020
I'm done taking it like a um,
no,

2488
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:57,870
don't be that guy.
Well and was saying is I'm taking that.

2489
01:56:57,871 --> 01:57:02,010
I'm exercising and I'm doing therapy.
Right.

2490
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:03,413
That's like all the things that they say
are good and you're tracking it every 

2491
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:07,140
day.
Yeah.

2492
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,033
I don't know if that helps,
but I'm pretty sure they tell you to 

2493
01:57:10,231 --> 01:57:11,800
jack off a lot.
Well,

2494
01:57:12,170 --> 01:57:14,930
to say to that,
reaching out for help is key.

2495
01:57:15,310 --> 01:57:17,280
Yes.
Prognosis.

2496
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:21,210
That's you're already the champion.
You're doing what you should be joining.

2497
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:22,830
Yeah,
it feels awesome.

2498
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,150
Yeah,
it's been good.

2499
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:25,583
Let me Brag for Tina for a second.
She did her special eight months 

2500
01:57:28,951 --> 01:57:29,784
pregnant.
You were super pregnant and all the 

2501
01:57:32,251 --> 01:57:33,930
promos and stuff.
It's amazing.

2502
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:35,043
I was there.
I remember seeing the Promo video and 

2503
01:57:36,841 --> 01:57:39,480
they just have you like in a black Jack 
Table.

2504
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:40,493
I feel like it's because you couldn't 
really walk Ragnar now that you killed 

2505
01:57:44,551 --> 01:57:47,400

It's so much fun in Vegas and downtown 

2518
01:58:27,901 --> 01:58:29,820
Vegas,
the seediest of all places.

2519
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:32,820
I'm eight months pregnant.
I had a door fall on me a second.

2520
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,950

2525
01:58:43,061 --> 01:58:46,120

2527
01:58:48,611 --> 01:58:50,160
family.
Yeah.

2528
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:51,760
So cool.
That's great man.

2529
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,050
We,
we saw it together,

2530
01:58:53,051 --> 01:58:55,300
went to a screening together.
It starts Mark Walberg,

2531
01:58:55,301 --> 01:58:57,490
Rose Byrne.
It's like a big family comedy,

2532
01:58:57,730 --> 01:58:58,780
but it's really.
Well,

2533
01:58:58,781 --> 01:59:01,600
but it's November 16th,
November 16th.

2534
01:59:01,601 --> 01:59:02,850

Yeah,

2535
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:04,520

2536
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:08,210
This is your first feature.
Absolutely.

2537
01:59:08,211 --> 01:59:09,130
Yeah.
That's exciting.

2538
01:59:09,370 --> 01:59:10,203
It was very excited.
It was very fun thing and it's like a 

2539
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:15,850
major movie.
It's not just like a piece of shit.

2540
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:19,840
Do you have a lot of screentime in it?
I probably have like,

2541
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:23,430
I don't know,
somewhere between seven and 10 seats.

2542
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:24,970
You know,
it's like a supporting character.

2543
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:28,900
I mean there's 50 scenes in the movie I 
can think in a lot of.

2544
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:32,380
I would love to see you and more role 
that.

2545
01:59:32,530 --> 01:59:33,363
It was fun.
I thought I even in the trailer I was 

2546
01:59:34,781 --> 01:59:35,614
like,
I love this.

2547
01:59:35,890 --> 01:59:40,330
I had a good time doing it and I had A.
I mean I'm with like all stars man,

2548
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:44,730

who's a huge movie star at Roseburg,

2549
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:48,310

But then like all the supporting cast,

2550
01:59:48,350 --> 01:59:53,350
like Margo Martindale from the Americans
and sneaky Pete and Julie Haggerty.

2551
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,990
