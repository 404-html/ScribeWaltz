1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,680
Hello.
Nice to see you again.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,290
Thanks for joining us today on this 
very,

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,180
very special episode of the HD podcast.
No Man's left behind.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,040
Uh,
first of all,

5
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,250
let me welcome you all

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,300
under the Gazebo.
Today on a very special podcast,

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,340
we'll be joined by kid,
the producer and the intern isla.

8
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:30,174
The pregnant

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,280
no means left behind today.
We are sponsored by skill share.

10
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,830
Now let me explain what is going on 
today.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,693
Okay.
Throughout the year we've covered a lot 

12
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:43,870
of stories.
We've talked about a lot of things,

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,260
but there's always these great goofs 
laughs and gaffs and boobs even.

14
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:53,110
I would even venture to say a couple of 
booths that fall through the crack.

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,363
They're great,
but we just didn't have time to get to 

16
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:57,454
them.
And so we've asked Dan and Ian and Isla 

17
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:00,714
and even myself to go through all of our
documents over the course of the past 

18
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,403
year and to salvage to save our fallen 
meme brothers who have fallen behind 

19
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:12,460
enemy lines.
And we've said,

20
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:13,960
no,
these are fresh,

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,500
these are spooky.
These deserve to be aired.

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,440
And so that is what we are here to do 
today.

23
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:23,710
So today,
no me will be left behind.

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,800
And uh,
that's it.

25
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:28,510
So Ian and,
uh,

26
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,850
and Dan,
would you join us please in the,

27
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:34,300
uh,
in the office here in the studio?

28
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,320
So introducing a dam

29
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,630
of course.
Yes.

30
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,080
Round of applause as a couple of God 
dammit.

31
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,090
Join us if you would please.
Thank you so much.

32
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,303
Now Dan is

33
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,730
now,
how long have you guys been with this?

34
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,860
Uh,
let's see.

35
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,260
It was a,
what was your first episode?

36
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,700
The first episode was a,
you know what the first episode was,

37
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,860
Joey Salads?
I think so.

38
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,980
How was that as like an introduction?
You were,

39
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:05,290
I don't know if you were fans of us,
but you knew who we were.

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,771
Yeah,
no,

41
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:08,460
I was a fan.
I watched the show or the,

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,150
the main channel,
uh,

43
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,013
pretty regularly,
so I knew Joey Salads and that was 

44
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:13,714
definitely,
that was definitely a weird thing to 

45
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,650
step into.
But I think the second week with Steevo,

46
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,660
which was fucking awesome to get to meet
him.

47
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:22,180
So that was,
that was a good introduction.

48
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,730
Dan,
the producer we cherish and love.

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,073
We were a bit of a mess here.
And Dan was like a great recommendation 

50
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:31,900
from somebody through twitch.
Right?

51
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,850
Yeah.
And so we're like,

52
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,620
dude,
do you want to just work full time?

53
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,630
It was like,
well yeah.

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,590
And uh,
the rest has been history as they say.

55
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:42,390
And we're just,
Oh,

56
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,280
about a year ago,
well it was even longer.

57
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,720
Um,
summer.

58
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,800
It was summer of 2017 so yeah,
so there you go.

59
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:51,760
Time flies,
man.

60
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:52,810
Seriously,
I'm flying.

61
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,130
That's crazy actually.
And Ian,

62
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,420
of course,
the illustrious,

63
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,910
uh,
I want to say the eternal intern.

64
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,980
Oh,
I reached to us has a

65
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,660
great origin story.
Ian.

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,300
Ian Was Richard not to us even before we
hired then.

67
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,134
I think both.
You didn't have to even follow up with 

68
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:10,210
him.
Well,

69
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,970
I've probably,
I've probably told the story a couple of

70
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:13,840
times,
but it bears being repeated because it's

71
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:18,580
such a great cause that we get a lot of 
emails from people and our,

72
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,430
you know,
we have a work with h three email that's

73
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:23,560
open to the general public.
We've got a lot of requests,

74
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:27,700
a lot of emails.
But Ian comes through very respectable,

75
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,250
very eloquent.
And he says,

76
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,210
Hey,
you know what,

77
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,220
I would like to be an intern for you.
And uh,

78
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,470
you must've emailed us like 20 times.
Like shawshank redemption.

79
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:41,410
Like remember when he was writing the 
letter asking for library funds?

80
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,273
That was,
yeah,

81
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,271
yeah,
fair.

82
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:47,470
I kept telling him keep checking in with
us cause I know we'll need help,

83
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,810
but we can't do it right now,
but we will.

84
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,750
So,
and were you a fan of ours am yeah.

85
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,993
Yeah,
it was.

86
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,860
I really,
yeah,

87
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,723
yeah,
yeah,

88
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,120
yeah,
yeah.

89
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:02,620
I really kind of harassed you guys.
I was basically,

90
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,454
you know,
just,

91
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,580
you know,
bothering it nonstop.

92
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,580
I worked out.
Now was that a technique I have to ask,

93
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:10,414
what were you reading?
Other people's similar emails because 

94
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:16,120
you had a strategy and I'm wondering 
other people were,

95
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,980
you know,
not rallying out.

96
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,100
Not really actually,
because you know,

97
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,830
you guys were,
were the most open,

98
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,570
you know,
a lot of people just,

99
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:26,404
you know,
trash,

100
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,530
recycle this email.
So,

101
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,640
you know,
you guys were open,

102
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:32,140
like you said,
you said keep trying.

103
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:32,974
So,
you know,

104
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,813
you kept at it.
Well that's a good life lesson for all 

105
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:36,964
the people out there.
That persistence is truly the key to 

106
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:45,460
either success or prison depending on 
how weird you are fighting your case.

107
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,220
Success restraining order.
Yeah.

108
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,690
One or the other.
Yeah.

109
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,970
That's good to know the difference.
But not all of us have that gift.

110
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,830
And Ian,
I want to say a,

111
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,690
it has been a treat,
a pleasure,

112
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:59,830
a joy we love and so much,
God bless [inaudible] intern.

113
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,490
He's not really an intern anymore.
He's blossomed into so much more.

114
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,990
My first episode was when skippy and 
John's miss.

115
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,310
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

116
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,400
I wanted to come into,
wow.

117
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:18,310
I feel like things have like tamed since
you guys started.

118
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,950
We got to get back into doing some more 
weird and wild stock.

119
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,863
But um,
those were the days persuaded Joey 

120
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,940
Salads and over a year,
well,

121
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,880
I'm looking forward to our Christmas 
special this 21st.

122
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,060
Right.
We're going to do another chair.

123
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:33,250
Do you?
Christmas special.

124
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,440
Oh,
well,

125
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,520
okay.
Well yeah,

126
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:40,930
we're doing it with Justin Roy Lynn,
Alex Hirsch and Dana terrorists.

127
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:43,160
Terrorists sang it,
right?

128
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,630
That's right.
Yeah,

129
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,500
I think you're right.
I don't,

130
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,180
I blanked.
But anyway,

131
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,270
and Joey Salads,
so we're trying to think how can we,

132
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,310
you know,
involve Joey Salads in this?

133
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:53,650
And we were thinking,
well we already pepper sprayed him.

134
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,500
Maybe we can shoot them with a nonlethal
bein bad.

135
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,450
I don't know.
That'd be fine.

136
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,660
And of course justin will have to be the
one that pulled the trigger.

137
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,500
They'll repeat though the 21st mark it 
down on the calendars.

138
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,390
Boys.
We're going to do all a lot of good this

139
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,223
year.
And that would be the last episode 

140
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:13,530
before I will say yes.
Yes.

141
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,230
Yes.
Well guys,

142
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,064
I'm here.
We are gathered today at the podcast 

143
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,170
table and um,
we have a lot of,

144
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,420
yeah.
How does it feel being in here?

145
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:25,940
Do you guys like being in here or do you
not like being in here?

146
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,880
It's,
I dunno,

147
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,010
I definitely prefer to be behind the 
scenes,

148
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,510
but it's okay.
Ian,

149
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,710
do you like your airtime?
Oh,

150
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm having a panic attack.
I'm not like,

151
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,330
you like the air.
I think I'm a camera hog.

152
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,810
You're not buttoned up.
I know him means a hog.

153
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:42,890
What I mean,
you know,

154
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,051
you,
you're,

155
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:44,810
you're,
you,

156
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,370
you have a presence on camera.

157
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,920
Yeah.
You have a natural charisma.

158
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,490
I always think that he,
and he was like more like me.

159
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,740
It's subtle.
It's subtle.

160
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,240
It's subtle panic attack.
I'll slow keep it together,

161
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:02,120
but still,
I mean I don't mind it.

162
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,020
Sure.
Yeah.

163
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,000
You love it.
Lamb,

164
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,320
that handle of whiskey right before we 
came in here,

165
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,860
holding it down,
that's the case.

166
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,390
So we have together,
um,

167
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,830
I will go first.
I have what I call it,

168
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:16,664
the Turkish food segment and this is one
that I have personally been working on 

169
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:24,890
for a long time and you guys have been 
kind of working along with me to collect

170
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:28,850
these videos.
The whole world out there on instagram.

171
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,210
I was browsing the explore tab and you 
know,

172
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,073
they've got this algorithm,
so when you click one video then they 

173
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,104
know to show you more like it.
And I started watching these incredible 

174
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,990
Turkish chefs doing stuff that I've 
never seen done with food before.

175
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,183
And I went down this crazy rabbit hole 
of Turkish instagram cooking some 

176
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:52,880
amazing,
some disgusting,

177
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,610
some hilarious.
It's about at all.

178
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,693
And I'm,
and I'm passionate about this and I 

179
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,720
watched this to this day.
In fact,

180
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:04,160
I saw one this morning that I'd like to 
open up with that was completely,

181
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,443
completely confused by it.
And maybe you guys can tell me what is 

182
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:09,410
this.
So tell me,

183
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,370
what is this?

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't know what it is.
It looks like a penis.

185
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,870
He says Penis White,
Clara frying open.

186
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,790
What looks like a Oregon.
God,

187
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,624
is that like a bull?
But it looks like it's like dry flower 

188
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:35,880
coming out of this.
I mean,

189
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:40,590
I don't know what on earth while I was 
curious.

190
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,600
So I translated the description and

191
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,740
it always goes great.
And um,

192
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,610
I'll read it for you guys here today.
No,

193
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,543
I'm Turkish name that.
I've never seen anything like the 

194
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,640
translation for 16 months and tripe 
belly fat cheese open and tasted for the

195
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:01,824
wildlife.
It was quite heavy and couldn't even 

196
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:07,980
stand the smell,
but a very special and delicious cheese.

197
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,680
Um,
in general,

198
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:11,514
the families for consumption at home 
such as pressing out the room and we're 

199
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,430
not coincide.
I,

200
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,280
yeah,
this gets,

201
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,450
no,
that clears it all.

202
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,970
It just says wildlife but not what I,
animal barely fats.

203
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,510
Well it sounds like it was fermented and
an actual belly,

204
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,960
but I love this line.
I couldn't even stand the smell.

205
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,950
Very special.
Yeah.

206
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,840
So there you have.
But would that being said,

207
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:41,070
let's jump right into this Turkish food.
Let's see what we have here.

208
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,333
So one thing I've noticed,
because in Israel obviously there's 

209
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:48,474
rules of kosher,
which means you cannot mix meat and 

210
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,044
cheese.
But the Turks almost in a way of being 

211
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:58,761
like sucks to be Jewish.
They go all out on the cheese and meat.

212
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:02,700
Like even in America I've never seen 
before.

213
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,020
It would take a look at this.
I thought they were kosher in,

214
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,630
in Turkey as well.
Well it's,

215
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:12,330
hello Dan is what it's called and they 
actually,

216
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:15,690
hello?
You can mix meat and cheese.

217
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,870
They cannot drink alcohol,
but they are not,

218
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
they share a lot of the similarities.
Like they don't eat pig.

219
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,003
Right?
Right.

220
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,060
Yeah.
But they plant food and shellfish.

221
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:26,770
Shellfish.
Yeah.

222
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,670
Yeah.
Huh.

223
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,590
But they can do the dairy and the meat.
And so they are like,

224
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,920
God bless them.
They took their like praise be to a law.

225
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,580
We're going all out.
But that's dairy and meat.

226
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,330
Yeah.
As you should so happy.

227
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,710
I never,
first of all,

228
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:44,544
what is this whole method of cooking is 
bananas to me so that he cooked it and 

229
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,960
like a pile of sand.
Whoa.

230
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,610
He takes out this unbelievably tender 
rack of ribs,

231
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,340
loved the music management,
Spiderman and elsewhere.

232
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,513
Those bones slide right out.
I mean this is a incredibly beautifully 

233
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:05,400
cut piece of meat.
Now here's where it gets insane.

234
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,803
I don't know what this is,
but he took a what looks like 10 pounds 

235
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:14,181
of cheese and put it on top 10 pounds of
cheese on top and just without any grief

236
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,460
at all,
that's it in half.

237
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,294
I mean,
look,

238
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,860
sprinkles a little good measure.
Imagine that.

239
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,910
I'll tell you something right now.
I will eat though.

240
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,243
He had had,
sure you are kind of obsessed with this 

241
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,550
videos.
Does it tell you about that end?

242
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:38,910
I know you

243
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,650
guys are boring Vegans,
but why?

244
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,850
I mean,
did you,

245
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,110
uh,
have respond to that?

246
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:45,150
Did your pulse increase?
Weirdly?

247
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:45,984
I love me,
but that completely made me not hungry 

248
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:49,990
at all.
The opposite thought.

249
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,550
Something about taking a junk,
cheesy shit on that beautifully.

250
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:54,020
It's,

251
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,853
I mean it's like a log of food.
I don't like eating logs if I would 

252
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:01,030
definitely try that.
And you guys,

253
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,410
you,
you find it Apps,

254
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,440
I imagine not,
I dunno what's nauseous,

255
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,210
but I probably would be nice as from 
the,

256
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,850
if you could feel nauseous,
it's not great.

257
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,030
I mean,
yeah,

258
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:16,031
I'm not Vegan so hey meet,
uh,

259
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,310
10 years ago.
Oh,

260
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,150
so it's been a minute.
I'm deep in it yet.

261
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,523
You've been at Dev,
you do ever feel that your will will 

262
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,850
bray frame purpose.
Yeah,

263
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,080
occasionally.
And what is it attempts you?

264
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,570
Um,
you know,

265
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:32,710
weirdly,
uh,

266
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,780
seafood still is like appetizing.
Mm.

267
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,790
Um,
more so than a meat.

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,310
I don't know.
It's weird cause it's,

269
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,670
it's very much just kind of,
um,

270
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,460
big den after a while and certain things
like any kind of pork pig,

271
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,900
the smell of it is like,
it makes me almost nauseous.

272
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,100
Oh,
I was like so bad.

273
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,740
But like other meats,
like chicken,

274
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,230
not bad at all.
Like that's not bad.

275
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:04,810
And even beef for somebody in pork in 
particular,

276
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,400
it's gain.
It's powerful.

277
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,620
Yeah.
And it's,

278
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,463
and it's,
uh,

279
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,080
somehow that the Muslims and the Jews 
both were like,

280
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:12,914
we can't eat that yet.
So maybe there's something to that 

281
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,880
maybe.
Um,

282
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,960
and so why did you go vegetarian Dan?
Uh,

283
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,820
originally,
um,

284
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,820
for girl that I was dating the best 
reason,

285
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,560
absolutely.
I'm a vegetarian for a guy to go.

286
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:33,200
There you go.
Vegan for right relationship.

287
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,630
Really?
Oh wait,

288
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:37,550
how long are you Vegan?
Like six months,

289
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,503
but I started to feel very ill.
Did you immediately bounce and when you 

290
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,050
broke up with her?
No,

291
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:44,570
I tried to keep it for a bit,
but um,

292
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,050
you felt you have to do it correctly.
So I was like,

293
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,270
oh,
well I'll just eat some cheerios cause I

294
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:51,510
don't know how to cook anything.
Right,

295
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,363
sure.
You know,

296
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,323
you got it.
You have to have like a whole plan of 

297
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:55,251
meals.
Oh,

298
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,230
you,
you become like malnutrition.

299
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,183
Yeah,
yeah,

300
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,140
yeah.
Well I look at you.

301
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:00,951
How was the,
I mean,

302
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:03,080
was it worth it for her?
Was she a good no,

303
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,040
no,
it wasn't even worth it.

304
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,860
Okay.
There.

305
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,743
Yeah.
The guys,

306
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,923
there's a good chance that you guys will
go on a diet of some point in your life 

307
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,880
or off a diet because of some dick or a 
vagina.

308
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,370
So there you have it.
But moving on,

309
00:14:16,371 --> 00:14:17,240
this is,
we're just in,

310
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,450
this is just one video in to me.
I would,

311
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,160
Ooh.

312
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,153
You know,
why don't you ever take cheesy shits on 

313
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:24,814
my meat?
The way he just dumped the cheese on 

314
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,090
there?
Something breaks.

315
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,430
Like are the art these amazing,
like he's like,

316
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,310
look at these amazing slow clipped ribs.
Nope.

317
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,820
We're not done with it yet.
Boom.

318
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,443
Like seriously,
five pounds of cheese that's a slug and 

319
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,440
looks alive.
Yeah.

320
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:48,270
Well guess what it is.
Something's moving in me,

321
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,443
my Dick.

322
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,533
Gotcha.

323
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,080
Cause I uh,
like it that much for that.

324
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,760
Thank you.
Thank you everybody.

325
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:01,310
Thank you for laughing and it's you,
me guys,

326
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,790
appreciate that next nobody left.
I noticed.

327
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,483
So this one.
So sometimes what they make such an 

328
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:14,840
obscene amount of food that it,
it literally doesn't make sense.

329
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:16,670
Like I didn't even know how he uses all 
this.

330
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,743
So a restaurant I know,
but even still like [inaudible] it is a 

331
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:25,370
restaurant.
He looks like he's on the older equals.

332
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,430
That's true.
Wow.

333
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:32,410
Ray William Johnson took a weird twist 
of Glasgow,

334
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,950
so he flips upside down,
was probably 20 or 30 pounds of food,

335
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,580
a food that frankly doesn't even look 
like it belongs together.

336
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:45,930
But right off the bone,
right off the bones.

337
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,290
This is their mood.
They juggle it.

338
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,660
I know it's,
it's amazing.

339
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:55,494
Like stuffed pepper looks.
You'd hit that if it was cooked to meet 

340
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,140
my mom cook separately.
But yeah,

341
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,800
so if it's cooked and me,
you're,

342
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,210
you're still down.
I mean,

343
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,410
it's a gray area.
Okay.

344
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,253
It's a great,
yeah.

345
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,323
So the volume is really kind of what 
fascinates me here and having such a 

346
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,700
good guy.
He's always smiles all the time.

347
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,010
Yeah.
Do you know what this guy is?

348
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:28,300
Can you like seek him out?
Yeah,

349
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,173
he was huge on instagram.
Is videos get like millions of views or 

350
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,823
you got to go to Turkey someday and go 
eat at this guy's from year to go to 

351
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:36,670
Turkey.
They don't like Jews.

352
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:39,880
They doing,
but it's like gotten worse or they don't

353
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:43,470
like Israelis day late.
But now you can go.

354
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,980
I can go.
No.

355
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:49,981
As a Jew I can go get some of this meat.
How was your trip to Turkey?

356
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,280
It was nice.
It was like going to grace,

357
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:54,180
you know?
It's like really?

358
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,350
Did you see any crazy food and stuff?
Turkey's pretty sexy.

359
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,830
I mean it's not.
No,

360
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,390
it's gotten more.
Things are getting a little crazy there.

361
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,150
I ate regular stuff.
Nothing crazy.

362
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,370
Hmm.
That's a shame.

363
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,680
It similar to Israel.
Um,

364
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,290
okay,
so here you go.

365
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:20,050
That's your boy again.
All smiles sand.

366
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,500
I don't know what he did.
It looks like snow that he's cooking.

367
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,500
New Salt or salt.
Salt.

368
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,810
Look at this.
Look at that.

369
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,370
Perfect.
Look at that smile.

370
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:33,290
Look at that.
What's not to love?

371
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,560
This guy's a legend.
It's a beautifully,

372
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,730
perfectly cooked beef loins.
Okay,

373
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,283
but wait,
before they found out this Spiderman 

374
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,860
Nelson music.
But wait,

375
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:47,923
my dude

376
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,190
I queued and Oh my God,
this was pretty normal.

377
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,940
Yes,
it's there.

378
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,720
Look at this as,
oh my goodness.

379
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,053
There you go.
I'm telling you these guys are way over 

380
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:10,494
the top,
but the beat like I feel is almost 

381
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:15,840
trolling the American crowd.
Here's what you want is,

382
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,541
I see.
Right,

383
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,310
right.
But it's Turkish people watching it.

384
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:20,920
It's not Americans is it?
I'm the only American watching this.

385
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,930
I swear to God.
It's all Turkish.

386
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,850
The comments.
Well that's what I thought too.

387
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:25,631
Everyone's like,
oh,

388
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:28,240
look at how what these Americans eat and
these Turkish people are like,

389
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,750
like making us look like amateur.
Yeah.

390
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,320
Yeah.
I haven't ever seen,

391
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,120
I'm going to stop watching porn.
Just watch when he dipped,

392
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,193
pours that cheese on that steak.
That's enough to get me rock hard every 

393
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:43,030
time.
Um,

394
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,983
what else we got?

395
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,053
Okay,

396
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,370
this one is so weird,
man.

397
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,770
I'm wondering what you guys are going to
think about this.

398
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,900
So he starts with the meat.
He's got a huge hammer tank.

399
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,743
It's got a mallet,
like a massive hammer and a witch's 

400
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,500
cauldron.
Oh,

401
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:03,990
he's doing this classic little shake 
meat off the bone.

402
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,450
Yes sir.
I don't know what's on the bottom there,

403
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:11,040
but I'm down.
So now he takes it.

404
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,340
He's got meat and tomato paste and a 
huge hammer and he's liquid eye.

405
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,390
He's smashed it all into it.
Looks like reefer.

406
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:22,310
I advanced.
Yeah,

407
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,153
it looks like our re fried beans.
I've never seen cooking like this my 

408
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:31,911
whole life.
So now somehow this chicken and meat,

409
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,620
it's turned into a paste and he's the 
line,

410
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:36,454
the bottom of the pan.
And now he's just covering it with 

411
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,533
boiling oil.
Like if you told me there was meat in 

412
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,530
that,
I wouldn't have no idea.

413
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,620
I mean,
what the hell was that?

414
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,500
That one has me scratching my head.
Is that wild or what?

415
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,600
Yeah,
I don't know what it looks like.

416
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:56,970
You could like,
it's like asphalt at the end.

417
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,050
He could pay for road with that,
but you start with this really succulent

418
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:03,150
beautiful meat and then you just,
I,

419
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,770
I then he pours oil over it like,
but that's fascinating.

420
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,990
Um,
we've got more.

421
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,310
You guys don't,
don't lose.

422
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,770
I don't worry.
Here's your boy.

423
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:16,680
He's the sheep king.
I think he mostly cooks lamb.

424
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:20,610
So he made this hit for all of his fans 
on instagram in the world at large here.

425
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,840
Yes.
Everybody throw your hands up,

426
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,460
sees the end bora.
I love how he's like,

427
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:38,461
I'm eat fucking kid.
Throw it up y'all.

428
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,000
What is this?
His song,

429
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,680
his original fit,

430
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,020
but this guy's restaurant,
super famous.

431
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,460
Like on his instagram,
I've seen the,

432
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,623
the the president of Turkey.
They're only seen celebrities in his 

433
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,610
right or the one,
yeah.

434
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,530
Watches instagram.
I shouldn't say,

435
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,360
I have no idea.
It just,

436
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,890
I followed it.
I don't know what it is.

437
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,180
Turkish.
I really don't do it.

438
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:14,920
If you type Turkish food,
he'll pop up.

439
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,860
He's the god Bro.
He's the God.

440
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,640
Look at him.
He's,

441
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,090
he's herding the sheep.
He's the God.

442
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,280
You had like a little Pied Piper thing 
going on there.

443
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:24,480
Yeah.
I'm telling you,

444
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:25,314
this is a whole rabbit hole,
but I'm not done yet because all my 

445
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:31,170
adventures.
Did you know that Salt Bay,

446
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,460
the original Salt Bay is part of the 
Turkish food phenomenon,

447
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,130
right?
Yeah.

448
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,710
He is probably next to this guy.
The most famous,

449
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,813
his videos get so many views.
I'm talking like 12 20 million views on 

450
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:49,170
instagram of him doing slapping me.
Oh,

451
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:50,720
I have another slapping the shit out of 
the meat.

452
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,690
Oh,
I have another sheep.

453
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:52,860
God,
I sorry.

454
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,970
It looks like a penis.
I mean this is so wild.

455
00:21:56,971 --> 00:21:57,781
Whoa.
Yeah.

456
00:21:57,781 --> 00:21:58,800
This is the sheep.
God

457
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,313
look at it.
It was just a carcasses and a giant 

458
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,070
sheep meat piss in the middle.
I mean,

459
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,320
I never seen anything like it in my 
life.

460
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,500
She Paul,
because that's what the notch,

461
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,250
but it looks amazing.
I mean that's pretty awesome.

462
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,273
Oh yeah.
That meat is like a dozen patients is 

463
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,553
pretty unbelievable.
The way they click it and everything is 

464
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:31,164
so off the chain at some.
That one is actually on the menu as she 

465
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:40,140
paul a cost and it's a very popular dish
actually in the Middle East.

466
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,070
Um,
I love how he,

467
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,740
when,
when you have like the super heavy nasty

468
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:47,574
dishes and you just sprinkle a little 
like a parcel on old to make it look 

469
00:22:51,931 --> 00:22:52,764
fresh.

470
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,103
Are there,
you have it.

471
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,240
I don't even like your piece set that 
here.

472
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,730
I don't know what we do.
Well,

473
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,803
he wasn't done.
The second part is that he puts it in a 

474
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:04,520
college random beats it into a pace.
I see.

475
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,080
And that was,
that was a two parter.

476
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,640
Okay.
So back to Salt Bay.

477
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,333
So this I shit you not,
this video has 10 million on instagram 

478
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,800
of Salt Bay.
Uh,

479
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,970
this guy,
I was kind of,

480
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,440
I have to say a little bit disillusioned
when I saw salt bays actual content,

481
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:25,723
because as you'll see in this video,
he does not display the best cooking 

482
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:32,180
prowess that swatch.

483
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,070
So he has a sausage that's pretty rap 
cuts.

484
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:43,071
It very dramatically feels off rapping 
like he wants to fuck it.

485
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:46,784
I mean,
yeah,

486
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,390
now he takes a whole,
Sasha's cuts it in half.

487
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,010
Okay.
With it so far,

488
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,110
really not into it.
And he just throws it on the grill,

489
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,640
lapping it together.
Let's set.

490
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,553
Yup.
Okay.

491
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,040
And here's,
of course were all good.

492
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:09,041
Turkish cuisine goes tons of meat,
doesn't not spread evenly,

493
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:12,470
not even close to spread it to them.
I mean,

494
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:14,900
not even close,
like not even close.

495
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,150
The whole left side is no cheese.
And the right side.

496
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:20,450
It's a nice smashes it down and there 
you have it,

497
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:21,560
my friend.
But that's it.

498
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,960
That's it.
That's it.

499
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,360
You didn't even cook anything.
Why?

500
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,860
What are you doing?
And so there you have it.

501
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:31,790
And the Turkish flag.

502
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,680
Yeah,
that one.

503
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,830
I had me a little per after the lamb.
God I,

504
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,520
yeah,
that was a let down.

505
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,330
It's like watching like a straight to 
DVD sequel.

506
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:43,910
Right,
right.

507
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,931
Yeah.
I mean,

508
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:46,764
well gee ways.
I feel like I've done this exact meal 

509
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,610
when I was five.
Right.

510
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,760
Take us hot dog,
cut in half and put some cheese on it.

511
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,270
So there you have it.
Salt Bay in the flesh.

512
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,510
And one more that I thought was pretty 
insane.

513
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,600
I'll share with you from [inaudible]

514
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,970
Selfie.
He has what appears

515
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,890
to be a

516
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,173
beef mince.
It seems like he's doing some big 

517
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:14,940
technical,
oh,

518
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:19,140
come on Friday.
Actually I heard,

519
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:23,280
I read an article that he wears a diaper
because he comes in his pants 10 times a

520
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:24,114
day when he cuts me.
I think neo fought him in the second 

521
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,180
major.
Yeah,

522
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,320
you're right.
You're right about that.

523
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,240
So here he goes,
you know,

524
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,630
and now after searing it eat uh,
roles or the roles it and gold flakes,

525
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,250
gold flake.
Right.

526
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,870
Really that's,
those are gold flake.

527
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,170
The purpose of that,
I have no idea.

528
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,300
And it does as far as I can go.
Gold,

529
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,960
gold medal,
the precious metal.

530
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:53,360
Yes Dan.
But it's of all,

531
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,483
yeah,
I don't think I've seen gold flake 

532
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,170
dishes.
It's much less than it appears and oh,

533
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:03,130
he was classic move there again.
I'm just like,

534
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:08,190
just like mortal combat the body.
So you know the other guy makes him look

535
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,190
like a tool.
Yeah,

536
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,540
exactly.
No comparison.

537
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,490
Yeah.
So there you have it.

538
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,150
Turkish cuisine.
I had no idea.

539
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,140
It's fascinating.
Stuff went that deep.

540
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,540
So,
um,

541
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,570
it's all ways also Turkish,
big,

542
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:27,404
big,
big.

543
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,510
I say those are the two big boys in 
Turkish,

544
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,583
Turkish.
But what's funny if you get into this 

545
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:33,884
rabbit hole is that you'll find a bunch 
of knock offs who are doing so bad 

546
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:41,210
content trying to catch up with these 
guys.

547
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,320
I was like guys who were just making a 
falafel,

548
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:46,860
but they're trying to dance and be sexy 
and it has like 20,000

549
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:47,820
views,
but it's just,

550
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:48,870
it's great.

551
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,703
And they're trying to do this smile,
like he's just making falafels and he's 

552
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:55,500
got a big smile.
Great Turkish food on instagram.

553
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,350
Interesting.
Okay.

554
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,303
So there you have it.
There is the segments xtrordinair up 

555
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:05,310
next in has got something far.
Should we take a break?

556
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:09,780
We're at three 30 oh yeah.
So after the short break,

557
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:10,614
very short break in is going to grace us
with people falling off stage 

558
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,553
celebrities.
So we have a whole segment of 

559
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:22,500
celebrities falling off stage during 
their performances.

560
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,480
Is that correct Ian?
We've got a few of those.

561
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:26,520
Hell yeah.
I'm very much looking forward to that.

562
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:28,740
Sounds like a black,
they'll do not go away.

563
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:32,040
We will be right back after this short 
commercial break.

610
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:15,500

Head on over to teddy 

613
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:25,634
fresh.com/collection/sale.
We've got to do something about that 

614
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:33,140
url.
You can't change that,

615
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:34,630

Shopify,

616

teddy,
fresh.com/collection/sell.

617
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:39,310
But you can just go to the website and 
click the sales tab.

618
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,600
Hey,
we're back.

619
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:45,840
How did you do that?
Okay,

620
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,200
I was wondering how Dan knew we were 
coming back.

621
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,130
Just not that good.
We are back.

622
00:30:50,131 --> 00:30:55,131
Everybody know mean left behind yet it 
is your duty to,

623
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,690
uh,
save a meme.

624
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,750
I don't remember who kicked off the 
stage.

625
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:05,280
Falling one ditch was the,
I think the genesis may have been Kelsey

626
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:06,750
grammer.
It's going to play it from here.

627
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,650
Well,
I'm on the,

628
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,570
we have audio from that lap.
Let's switch here.

629
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,490
Yeah,
I should do it on,

630
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,150
up in here.
No problem.

631
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:18,490
I think the genesis was Kelsey grammar.
We had put that video in the,

632
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,770
the uh,
God Vevo and the God vapor.

633
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,430
Okay,
well I've got that one here.

634
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:26,070
So let me,
let me grab that here.

635
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,230
Cause I don't believe we ever actually,

636
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,230
she set this up with a little bit with 
some context.

637
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,371
Yeah.
So he,

638
00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:41,204
uh,
he was doing a speech at a Disney 

639
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,790
Disneyland I think or just,
yeah,

640
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,780
wait,
it was Disney.

641
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,510
Yeah.
Or he was at California adventure.

642
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,080
All bad things happen at small world.
I just love,

643
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,973
I love it.
So

644
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,100
it's one of the best,
the good Lord Ward backdrop.

645
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,360
He's pretty defeated about that.
I,

646
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,260
I've often wondered,
you know,

647
00:32:18,261 --> 00:32:21,830
there's this gag and family guy where 
Peter holds his leg and he goes,

648
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,300
ah,
forever.

649
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,320
I've wondered if this was in some way 
inspired by this clip because he kind of

650
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,120
does that here.
Yeah.

651
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,720
When did this is,
this looks like a really,

652
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,353
yeah,

653
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,340
there's like 10 people to see if he's 
okay.

654
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,780
Lomo and,
Oh,

655
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:55,100
good lord and oops.
Yeah.

656
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:57,320
I,
I didn't realize I was digging around in

657
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,210
Kelsey grammer's had a very rough life 
se yes.

658
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,303
Like very dark.
Really like what his father was 

659
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:06,920
murdered.
Oh,

660
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,230
whoa.
And his sister was murdered.

661
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,960
Why separate account?
Separate Times.

662
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,180
Random random murders.
Uh,

663
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,280
it was,
um,

664
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,540
I think his father was targeted by 
someone.

665
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,850
I read that,
but then his sister was,

666
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:24,020
uh,
uh,

667
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,480
she was attacked by it by four guys.
And,

668
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:27,150
uh,
they,

669
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,980
they stabbed her and left her to die.
Oh.

670
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,070
And then both of his half brothers died 
in a scuba diving accident.

671
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,040
Yeah.
His whole family perished.

672
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,791
I mean,
yeah.

673
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:40,860
All in different times of years apart.
That is,

674
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,000
that is unbelievably tragic.
I wouldn't leave the house if I was him.

675
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,790
And then there was a,
where he has fallen off the stage.

676
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,240
Yeah.
This is his first time.

677
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,203
There was a weird coincidence where the,
the name of the guy who killed his 

678
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:56,720
father,
whose last name was niles,

679
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,760
which is the name of his,
oh,

680
00:33:58,761 --> 00:33:59,594
the brother and brother and frazier.
And then the name of the guy who killed 

681
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:04,880
his sister.
His name was,

682
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:06,470
um,
was Freddy,

683
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,890
uh,
and his son's name and frazier's Freddy.

684
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,490
So like,
it's just the two close characters.

685
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:14,324
10 minute frasier are named after.
Is that a proof that we're in a 

686
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:17,324
simulation or I don't know the word 
conspiracy to kill the interesting 

687
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:22,120
thing.
Well,

688
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,480
that is very tragic.
Thank you,

689
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:24,314
man.
Yeah.

690
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,430
Yeah.
So,

691
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,490
uh,
serious like,

692
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,930
Gee Whiz.
Yeah.

693
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,900
That's how you can just go through your 
life.

694
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:34,610
Like take my life,
for example.

695
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,510
Everything's great.
Just,

696
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,890
you know,
we're married,

697
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:40,724
you can have it.
We're about to have a baby and then one 

698
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:47,570
day you could just be stabbed and it's 
like,

699
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,180
you know,
that's it.

700
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,660
And then you can also be avenue speech 
and fall off the stage.

701
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:54,830
I mean,
anything could happen.

702
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,070
Was those two things were about on the 
same level.

703
00:34:58,071 --> 00:34:58,904
Yeah.
Here's another one that we had at 

704
00:35:00,571 --> 00:35:01,490
woodside.
Madonna.

705
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,353
Uh,
this was at the Brit awards a few years 

706
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,533
ago.

707
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,683
Yeah.

708
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,283
So what happened here?
I guess they came up with the feds to 

709
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:25,040
come on.
I caught on someone's horn or something.

710
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,600
Apparently she was supposed to take the 
cape off earlier,

711
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,870
but it was tied too tightly and she 
couldn't get it off.

712
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,330
Wardrobe malfunction.
Yeah.

713
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,820
Let's see that one again.
Yeah,

714
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,950
that was,
that was quite,

715
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:40,320
the tumble there does not mean she knew 
it was coming.

716
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,460
Oh,
it's the trying to get it off right.

717
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:48,180
Somebody pulled in,
someone yanked her ass off the stage.

718
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,040
But the answers are all pros.
They just like keep going.

719
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,910
I think one of them may have been trying
to help her get it off.

720
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,310
Oh.
And he yanked her ass off the stage.

721
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,163
Yeah.
Cause he gave it up really good tug and 

722
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:04,680
he was like,
Oh fuck this kid.

723
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:07,950
Yeah.
She,

724
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:10,470
uh,
she responded to it.

725
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:13,020
She tweeted and said,
Armani hooked me up.

726
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,050
My Beautiful Cape was tied to tight.
Nothing can stop me.

727
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:19,900
And love really lifted me up.
Zach,

728
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,720
I heard you scream me out right from the
back.

729
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,560
Come on.
She's like a mega fall there.

730
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,050
Nothing can bring her down.
What did she say?

731
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,483
She said,
well,

732
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,050
uh,
love lifted me up.

733
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,520
Love lifted her up.
Sac.

734
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:35,310
Are you rebooting that and that?
Absolutely.

735
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,060
Here's a bieber one

736
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,240
or trying to fix his pants and I didn't 
see a massive hole of a lot of old shit.

737
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,450
Fucking giant.

738
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,650
You set that up.
So yeah,

739
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,020
he probably should have spotted that.
It's pretty big hole.

740
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,120
I don't know.
First of all,

741
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,960
who is managing the stage and leaves a 
giant hole in it.

742
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,400
I don't blame Biba.
Really?

743
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:10,990
Yeah.
No,

744
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,770
that'd be probably one of those where 
you're like,

745
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,940
show up from the hole,
but they should still cover it.

746
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,350
Oh yeah.
No.

747
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,423
Somebody got fired that night.
Justin seems to be wearing 20 layers of 

748
00:37:21,651 --> 00:37:25,680
clothing because I don't blame him for 
not being able to react.

749
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,010
It's chilly and those big,
don't we see that again?

750
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:28,690
That was really good.

751
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:33,690
Okay.
Oh my God.

752
00:37:33,911 --> 00:37:38,740
It's like a disappearing act.
This Justin Bieber or David Blaine.

753
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,023
See Ya.

754
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,741
You know,
I,

755
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:48,574
I feel bad for the biebs.
He gets a lot of crap from everyone 

756
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,343
trying to do his thing and he's just 
falling through holes and get right out 

757
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,090
there.
Any more information about that?

758
00:37:58,091 --> 00:37:59,870
I'm fascinated by that one.
Uh,

759
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,753
he,
he tweeted out the video and was just 

760
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,190
like,
I'm a cat.

761
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:04,720
I've got nine lives.
Lol.

762
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,270
Okay.
There's a real like,

763
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,320
that's like music.
He did a little added.

764
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,480
Yeah.
That's what you gotta do.

765
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:14,500
You just own it.
Yeah.

766
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:15,460
Are you,
uh,

767
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,940
are you big or you be blubber?
Oh,

768
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:18,783
we've talked,
we've,

769
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,040
we've got into it.
Yeah.

770
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,340
Bugatti.
Biebs.

771
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,370
He's the best.
Yeah.

772
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:25,240
Are you a fan of him?
I like him.

773
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:27,250
I think he's got,
I like his music.

774
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,580
I saw him on stage with post Malone and 
I thought he was great.

775
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,440
Everyone seemed to really like it.
Yeah.

776
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:33,040
He's super tiny.

777
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,970
He's got a great voice and he's got 
grace under the,

778
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,190
when he,
he's got grace,

779
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,323
you know,
I watched videos of the Paparazzi 

780
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:42,094
hassling him and it get,
and it does give me a tremendous amount 

781
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:49,210
of compassion for him and all the stupid
things he's done.

782
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,283
He's under a lot of pressure or pressure
and expectation and he's always been 

783
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,970
like the guy,
he's so famous,

784
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,133
like he's just trying to go outside and 
live his life and TMC lit in the end 

785
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,070
and,
and Paparazzi,

786
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:00,904
just obsessive.
We followed this guy trying to push his 

787
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:06,820
buttons and have been for years.
I mean,

788
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,930
oh,
has like a child star,

789
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:08,764
right?
Yeah.

790
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:12,370
He's been famous for considering the age
where this all happened to him.

791
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,300
The stuff he's done that people don't 
like him for his,

792
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,330
I don't think it's,
you know,

793
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,973
that severe,
he's just like a kid making some 

794
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:19,984
mistakes.

795
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,480
But what has he done that people are 
very upset about?

796
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:25,270
He liked peed and you'd like Pete in a 
bucket or something.

797
00:39:25,271 --> 00:39:26,860
So big deal.
What else?

798
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,910
He said,
uh,

799
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,290
I man,
you know,

800
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,210
yeah.
Oh,

801
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:34,150
he was at the ransom lady over.
Remember that video?

802
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,430
He was like,
I'm looking up Razzi that was trying to,

803
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,960
there was a little too close to his car.
Maybe you ran someone over.

804
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,130
He got out,
he went to like the Anne Frank Memorial.

805
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:51,280
And so he would have been a believer.
That was the day one.

806
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,230
That was the big one.
But that's just,

807
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,630
you know,
in retrospect it would have been,

808
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,850
yeah.
Yeah.

809
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,221
He's like,
listen,

810
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:02,470
if I was a little younger and I was born
in the forties,

811
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:06,300
I'd have fucked and frank.
Uh,

812
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,770
so then this is one of my favorites.
I,

813
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,640
I love this video so much.
Oh.

814
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,680
And then I got a couple angles here I 
got to bring up.

815
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,753
This is Travis Scott.
Drake's a boy meets world tour and 

816
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:22,570
there's another situation,
these big holes in the ground.

817
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,940
Big problem.
Big holds,

818
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:29,970
big problems.
His mic is auto tuned.

819
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,700
Oh my God.
What's in the halls?

820
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,020
And then,
yeah,

821
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,550
we,
some days have a trap door like that.

822
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:43,350
But yeah,
obviously somebody fucked up.

823
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,220
We had open now did he fall off the 
stage or in a hole?

824
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,220
I can't tell if he fell off something or
in something.

825
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,380
If there's a kilo in the middle.
Yeah,

826
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,570
yeah,
it's another wow.

827
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:57,780
He really,
and so the fact that you can auto tune a

828
00:40:57,781 --> 00:40:58,614
fall,
it goes to show you how hard over time 

829
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:03,410
these auto tunes go working.
Yeah.

830
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,360
And then drake cause like that's turn,
he tries to come help him.

831
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,953
Wait,
is that is she was an angel that looks 

832
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:24,140
really bad.
Well he

833
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,890
actually did a lot of damage,
uh,

834
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,450
when he fell in that whole really what 
happened actually,

835
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,440
well he made a statement.
Someone asked him about it.

836
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,730
He said,
I didn't fall,

837
00:41:31,731 --> 00:41:32,660
dude.
I flew,

838
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,910
I was floating.
I don't fall.

839
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:38,090
Oh come on.
Nothing happened.

840
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:40,940
Floating is amazing.
And he said,

841
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:43,590
I'm a magician.
Like David Blaine disappeared.

842
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,350
You know,
we called it a,

843
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:47,570
but actually the,
the um,

844
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:51,350
let's see.
This is what they keep in that whole,

845
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,323
uh,
it's like this big globe that death was 

846
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:57,520
in the hole.
They come,

847
00:41:57,521 --> 00:41:58,354
they like comes out of it and inflatable
globe thing that drake would perform 

848
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:03,134
with and uh,
he fell on it and smash the shit out of 

849
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:09,530
it.
And Drake did this whole show for free.

850
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:11,550
He had to refund.
He refunded everybody.

851
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,753
Yeah.
Cause that's like such a big piece of 

852
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:19,820
the show.
So for the globe was out right?

853
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,460
The globe with the right fricking that,
oh,

854
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,483
that was,
how much do you think that would have 

855
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:25,440
cost?
I mean,

856
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,800
I don't know.
Close to an alien because that's a bit,

857
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:31,550
it was like a huge arena in London o two
arena,

858
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,130
right?
Yeah.

859
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,520
That's like one of the huge ones and 
probably Amelie.

860
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,790
Yeah.
That Paul Costello.

861
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,540
Oh yeah,
I flew up.

862
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,420
Boy,
I wonder if he still got paid.

863
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:43,400
Travis Scott.
I don't know.

864
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,780
I mean drake probably wanting to make 
them fly a little bit.

865
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,220
Uh,
let's see.

866
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:50,054
Do we have a oh yeah.
And then I think this is one that you 

867
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:54,920
put in here.
This is a,

868
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,830
it was you,
you Miguel,

869
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,090
uh Oh.
This is the billboard music awards.

870
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,240
This one deserves to be slow mode 
though.

871
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,830
Well,
that's why she wants more.

872
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,520
Miguel kicks to girls in the face is 
what it's called.

873
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:12,863
And he attempts to jump over the crowd 
and what he ends up doing is it wwf 

874
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:17,640
crotch slam

875
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,293
on a four girl space.
Now let's watch it and almost feeding 

876
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:23,730
and backs Loma over.
And Simon,

877
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,043
this is really something here.
You'll notice as she sustained a life 

878
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:45,231
changing injury and then he gets close 
with the girl who didn't even get body.

879
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,463
He hugs.

880
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,210
I got hurt as a way.
It's like,

881
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:54,690
all right,
well we're out of here.

882
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:55,331
Go.
Yeah,

883
00:43:55,331 --> 00:43:59,950
let's go slow on this because this is a 
really special moment.

884
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:01,823
MMM,

885
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,120
let's go court.
Yeah,

886
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,920
there you go.
Let's see.

887
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:09,680
Fast forward.
There you go.

888
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,540
Quarter,
quarter speed in corridor.

889
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,200
Yeah,
go ultra slow here.

890
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,450
So here we have a

891
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,540
this faith,

892
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:25,180
I'm not sure why he thought this was 
great at wwf and body.

893
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,183
What a pro.
You'll notice that she falls to the 

894
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:38,070
ground and associated with the dark 
hair,

895
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:39,523
the dark hair right here.
Then the blonde girl girls like his 

896
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,120
music sounds even better.

897
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:52,683
And apparently I found this article 
where they said he was told not to do 

898
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:59,480
the jump.
He asked him before if he could and they

899
00:44:59,481 --> 00:45:00,314
were like,
don't do it.

900
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,633
And he went for it anyway.
And was there any consequence of that 

901
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,273
while they,
Felipe?

902
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,233
I actually,
I found this was immediately after 

903
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,593
backstage.
He brought the girl that hit the deck 

904
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,220
backstage to apologize

905
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,730
and then he did an interview with it.
Obviously there's a little bit of a,

906
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,550
you know,
you give it your all when you're onstage

907
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:27,460
icing her elbow.
No,

908
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:28,640
no,
no.

909
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,473
What happened?
Unfortunately we met under not the best 

910
00:45:34,281 --> 00:45:37,630
circumstances trying to quarter,

911
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,250
I'm not sure.
Like this is a setup for a day,

912
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,080
not the best circumstances.
They'll just kick you in the head

913
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,401
what happened?
No,

914
00:45:45,401 --> 00:45:45,700
no,
no.

915
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,720
He's like,
you know what happened?

916
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:47,120
He's like,
no,

917
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,953
no,
no.

918
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,373
It's Brown.

919
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,520
Raj slammed her to this day.
Yeah.

920
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,590
She really,
really got the brunt of it.

921
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,460
I see.
It's your elbow,

922
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,500
so you're still going to live dance to 
Miguel zones.

923
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,780
Where you a big fan of Miguel?
I'm gonna put you on the spot where you,

924
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:02,940
big fan of Miguel before he,
before he jumps on,

925
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:03,774
you know him and you still adored him 
even though even though you've got a 

926
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:09,190
nice size yeah.

927
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,480
Fan of change isn't it?
Apparently she,

928
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:15,670
uh,
went to the hospital not long after that

929
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:17,910
and uh,
she said,

930
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,390
uh,
she said that she was having some memory

931
00:46:22,391 --> 00:46:24,190
issues and stuff.
Oh my goodness.

932
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,710
But then her elbow.
Yeah.

933
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,780
And then two,
well,

934
00:46:28,781 --> 00:46:32,410
two years after this happened,
the other girl that got hit actually did

935
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:34,340
sue him.
Did she win?

936
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,890
I couldn't find any.
Uh,

937
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,520
yeah,
that was settle on something like that,

938
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:40,930
you know,
is,

939
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,420
is it a little messed up how they like 
parade her around afterwards?

940
00:46:43,421 --> 00:46:44,500
Like,
oh yeah,

941
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,810
she just hit her up or her elbows a 
little bit.

942
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,700
I mean,
she may have on a level been excited.

943
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,650
Like if she really was a fan,
it's like,

944
00:46:53,651 --> 00:46:54,484
okay,
I'll use this as an opportunity to get 

945
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,210
to meet my idol or whatever.
But um,

946
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,553
but yeah,
he was definitely keeping it ambiguous 

947
00:47:00,971 --> 00:47:03,180
for legal reasons as scripture.

948
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,570
Well,
that's what her representation,

949
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:10,270
he was like,
instead of taking her to get her checked

950
00:47:10,271 --> 00:47:11,104
out,
you brought her to go do a quick 

951
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,730
interview.
He was like that,

952
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,430
you know,
we don't really appreciate that.

953
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,570
Well,
God flows terrific stuff.

954
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,270
And that was the last of the stage 
falls.

955
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:23,663
What?
It shouldn't be as funny as it is to 

956
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:29,040
watch people follow this.
Yeah.

957
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:31,060
Is it just,
it's great because it's,

958
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:31,894
well,
watching someone fall just by itself is 

959
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:36,990
already great.
Right.

960
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,190
But then when you see like a famous 
person,

961
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,473
like these idols that people look up to 
that are like untouchable larger than 

962
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:48,511
life falling through a hole in the stage
contrast shot of mine to I believe is,

963
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:52,150
yeah.
It's humanizing,

964
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:52,984
I guess in a way.
Just see that they're just people they 

965
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,990
eat shit.
Some things.

966
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,123
Can you remember any bad falls you had 
in front of people that were 

967
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:00,660
embarrassing or,
hmm.

968
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,350
Because I fell down a flight of stairs 
at school once.

969
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,660
Yeah.
In front of a lot of other,

970
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:10,150
took a lot of times.
Tell me about the fall.

971
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,141
Yeah.
Well,

972
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:11,950
it was like,
it was,

973
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,050
it was very,
uh,

974
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:18,550
it was very icy outside and a lot of 
snow so everyone was tracking in a,

975
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:21,010
you know,
snow and it was very slippery and I just

976
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,500
down the whole thing,
you know,

977
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,540
on my ass and there were a lot of people
around.

978
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,160
So that was,
you were embarrassed.

979
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,260
Yeah.
You carry trauma from it,

980
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:30,050
do you think?
Yeah,

981
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,500
I'm still emotionally scarred.
I can't go up a flight of stairs.

982
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,420
I mean seriously.
Was it that,

983
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:35,470
was it a real,
it's just,

984
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:36,304
you know,
when you're in high school everything's 

985
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:40,720
even like feel like everyone's just 
hyper aware of what you're doing.

986
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:41,980
Where you injured?
No,

987
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:42,814
no I was not injured.
Is there anyone that you cared about 

988
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:46,234
that witnessed it?
Like a friend or a girl you were 

989
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,510
interested in?
No,

990
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,560
they were friends route obviously get 
roasted a lot.

991
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:51,503
I was like that my,
the only one that fell and had a bad 

992
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:57,080
phone call civic like traumatic incident

993
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,550
anyways,
it wasn't like embarrassing,

994
00:49:01,551 --> 00:49:02,384
but like my,
we were on those trips where they take 

995
00:49:05,301 --> 00:49:08,780
the whole class like at the end of the 
year and um,

996
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,890
we were in this one like keep with,
so I don't know what it was,

997
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,143
but there was someone who had like a 
little cart pulling like a little open 

998
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:20,420
card.
I don't know,

999
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:22,790
like something on wheels you could stand
on.

1000
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,030
And for some reason the whole class 
decided to go on it.

1001
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,463
I don't even remember how it happened,
but we all went and stood on this thing 

1002
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,193
while this is a guy who was driving this
little card and then he decided to take 

1003
00:49:35,391 --> 00:49:36,830
it turn and I fell.

1004
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,060
You fell off.
Just me.

1005
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,110
Kept going.
It didn't realize any,

1006
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:45,520
almost like went over my head

1007
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:51,870
stop right there and roasted by your 
classmates.

1008
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,253
I was more like,
I got in trouble because we weren't 

1009
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,150
supposed to do that.
Oh.

1010
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,850
And uh,
I dunno,

1011
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:58,843
I'm not quite sure.
I have an image in my head of what 

1012
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:04,280
happened,
like Kinda was a car with a cart and you

1013
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:05,390
all got in the back of the room.

1014
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:09,690
Good little car and like meaning like a 
golf cart or something like that.

1015
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:11,620
Yeah.

1016
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,970
And you were in the golf cart

1017
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,700
so he was carrying a thing on the back.
Oh,

1018
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,930
okay.
So it was kind of like an open,

1019
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,720
how many people were on it?
Like 30

1020
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,850
and you're the only one that ain't shit.
It's

1021
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,350
so much worse.
And you don't blow really hard.

1022
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,180
Yeah,
it was pretty bad.

1023
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,010
Oh,
I'm glad you survived out.

1024
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,253
Jesus.
I was just had a memory of something 

1025
00:50:39,571 --> 00:50:40,500
really embarrassing.
They did.

1026
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:43,120
I didn't fall,
but the best second remembers,

1027
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,870
I was super into yo-yoing.
I was smoking.

1028
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,010
I was so insane.
I was at the leap in it.

1029
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,873
I was cribbing it.
And of course my favorite and most 

1030
00:50:53,431 --> 00:50:55,950
impressive around the world,
the classic,

1031
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,630
you go around the world,
you're still spending,

1032
00:50:57,631 --> 00:50:58,464
you're still slamming.
And so I was going at the grocery store 

1033
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,950
with my friend and we were just doing 
Yoyo with his friend.

1034
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,853
The friend,
their parents was grocery shopping and 

1035
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:09,024
I'm doing around the world around the 
world having a good time and there's an 

1036
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:16,671
old lady that I fucking be here that was
stolen I guess like that.

1037
00:51:17,671 --> 00:51:19,320
And I didn't see her.
She crept up on me.

1038
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,693
Is it slow and quiet?
And I hit it right in the glasses and 

1039
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,120
her glasses fell off.

1040
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,900
Whoops.
You sent her around the world and uh,

1041
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,213
was that the x sprain?
I seem to remember that being like the 

1042
00:51:37,321 --> 00:51:38,460
cool one.
I don't remember,

1043
00:51:38,461 --> 00:51:39,810
but it was one of the good ones.
Yeah.

1044
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,490
Sick has bearings.
Does it,

1045
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,500
did your school try and people were 
always coming to my school and trying to

1046
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:48,600
sell me Yoyos yeah.
The thing that,

1047
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:52,380
did you have that like Jojo salesman,
Gabon?

1048
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,620
No,
my school outlawed Yoyos cause they were

1049
00:51:55,621 --> 00:52:00,621
being used at like,
but a variant that Lincoln Jojos at each

1050
00:52:01,891 --> 00:52:03,900
other.
But the lady she did,

1051
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:05,220
um,
she did,

1052
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,270
she passed on,
she was fine.

1053
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:10,620
She just yelled at me and I was super 
superman

1054
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,270
by the way,
my story,

1055
00:52:12,271 --> 00:52:15,740
it ended up also even in an article in a
local newspaper.

1056
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:17,993
What was the headline?
And that was the first time I learned 

1057
00:52:21,301 --> 00:52:22,134
that the media lies because they made up
this whole thing about had the driver 

1058
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:28,044
was telling us not to go on the thing 
and he didn't and it must have been a 

1059
00:52:33,781 --> 00:52:35,120
slow news day.
Yeah.

1060
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,600
Oh,
what was the headline?

1061
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,210
Some kid falls off a thing

1062
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,090
that you were the sub.
Wow.

1063
00:52:45,091 --> 00:52:47,790
Way that article.
Huh?

1064
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,713
So you have it in Israel,
you saved it like your parents think 

1065
00:52:52,891 --> 00:52:53,724
about that.
I tried to make it seem like less than 

1066
00:52:56,221 --> 00:52:58,050
it was because I didn't want to get in 
trouble,

1067
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:59,813
but we were like a way in in northern 
area so my parents couldn't like come 

1068
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:07,590
and see me or anything.
They called your parents to teach her.

1069
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,513
They called my mom and I was like,
don't tell dad like it's nothing 

1070
00:53:11,851 --> 00:53:12,684
serious.
And when you got back home where you in 

1071
00:53:15,241 --> 00:53:16,920
deep shit?
No,

1072
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:19,170
I think my mom,
she kept it.

1073
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,333
She,
I think I managed to make it seem like 

1074
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,870
not much happened.
Mom saved your ass

1075
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,143
and looking back really not much 
happened but I felt like I was going to 

1076
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:30,690
get in trouble.
Yeah.

1077
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:33,300
When you're a kid that's like,
oh yeah,

1078
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,810
come on.
There you have it.

1079
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,480
That's a credible,
what's next on the docket?

1080
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,270
That was it.
The next one is uh,

1081
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:44,120
you live segment,
I believe Isla segments.

1082
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,460
So what should we do?
Should we do a little bit variable?

1083
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:51,490
A ring around the Rosie,
although I guess you're there but you're

1084
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:52,890
going to throw it on the screen.
No.

1085
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,580
Oh,
she can do it from here down.

1086
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,390
All right,
we got this.

1087
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,470
There's no expectation here.
No Man left behind.

1088
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,071
Guys,
you know,

1089
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:05,730
one thing with the falling and this is,
this is a bit of a confession,

1090
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:09,720
but like this isn't like a public 
embarrassment thing.

1091
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,840
This is more my own shame when I'm alone
and I'm going up the stairs.

1092
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,453
I have like this weird tendency where I 
always try and do it too fast and I 

1093
00:54:20,101 --> 00:54:23,580
like,
I eat shit on the stairs often but never

1094
00:54:23,581 --> 00:54:26,970
like I keep it under wraps if I'm like 
with other people.

1095
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:27,931
Yeah,
exactly.

1096
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,120
Like I don't know why,
but I am always like,

1097
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,043
you know when I get home or something 
coming up the stairs of my apartment 

1098
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:34,404
building,
I'll be like two stepping it up and 

1099
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,050
just,
just full on,

1100
00:54:37,051 --> 00:54:39,590
just flat on my face.
It's happened countless.

1101
00:54:39,591 --> 00:54:41,670
You think this is a problem?
I mean,

1102
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:43,500
it's kind of a problem.
Like it,

1103
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:44,723
it's consistent enough that I'm aware 
that it's like a thing that I eat shit 

1104
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:48,924
on.
So why is it that you just don't slow 

1105
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:51,390
down?
Don't know,

1106
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,224
man.
It's something wrong with me because 

1107
00:54:53,851 --> 00:54:55,410
again,
if there's somebody else around,

1108
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,060
you know,
I'm not doing that.

1109
00:54:57,061 --> 00:54:57,894
You're not dealing that only by herself.
And have you ever seriously injured 

1110
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:01,850
yourself?
I mean,

1111
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,060
not seriously,
no.

1112
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:06,180
But it bash,
bash my elbow pretty fucking hard.

1113
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,940
Yeah.
Is it a thrill seeking I guess,

1114
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:11,020
or I'm just a,
I'm always like extreme.

1115
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:14,860
Like can I do it?
How many stairs can I do at once?

1116
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,310
Whatever.
It's such a like little kid thing.

1117
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:18,121
It's embarrassed.
See,

1118
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:21,600
I'm getting too fat and that is shaped 
that I have trouble on stairs.

1119
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,823
Just the one step is step one step is 
thrill seeking all the thrills thinking 

1120
00:55:25,411 --> 00:55:28,230
I need.
Are we having issues?

1121
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,210
Well guys,
as we've says,

1122
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:36,660
aided no means shall be left behind.
We are behind enemy lines.

1123
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:40,410
We are doing technical fixes.
Okay.

1124
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:41,071
Okay.
There you go.

1125
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:41,551
Sorry.
Okay.

1126
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:44,370
I want,
I was trying to save it.

1127
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,580
All right.
Eli,

1128
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,413
what is your segment once you got,
we miss this next story is one of my 

1129
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:57,240
favorite stories.
Oh yes.

1130
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:02,820
And corporate executive let us sacred 
devil life as an Australian poo jogger.

1131
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:05,183
And what happened is that this guy,
the Washington Post democracy dies in 

1132
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:12,300
darkness.
Yeah.

1133
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,800
Guy Was,
he had like a nice job.

1134
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:22,410
I'm sorry,
this is not used to the wwe was actually

1135
00:56:22,411 --> 00:56:24,010
on the city council

1136
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:29,910
inclusivity board,
which was oh yeah.

1137
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,000
You have this bullet point thing here.
Yeah.

1138
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:36,320
Yeah.
And,

1139
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:41,330
um,
so I don't know how to do this because I

1140
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:44,800
can't read it from the article you had 
just read from this.

1141
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:49,890
Okay.
So he was served on the city council,

1142
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,370
which made recommendations about how the
city should grow.

1143
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,773
And he had a pretty high up job.
He's a well respected member of the 

1144
00:56:58,571 --> 00:56:59,580
community.
Yeah.

1145
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:05,640
But in an unflattering picture on a 
public sidewalk and Australia,

1146
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,020
he recently was discovered as

1147
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:18,090
the infamous doing who jogger stage.
That's too perfect.

1148
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,200
So I think the story is

1149
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:24,243
not stage.
The guy that took this picture actually 

1150
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:31,950
was planning it for like a year because 
they kept getting this like human shit

1151
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,800
on this street

1152
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,183
and it was like not even,
it was clear that it wasn't an accident 

1153
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:44,910
cause sometimes you would even like 
toilet paper and next to them he left,

1154
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,790
he brought to the paper with him.
He went there to get outside.

1155
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,631
Yeah.
Wow.

1156
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:50,800
That's bless.
Pre murder.

1157
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:52,023
Premeditated kidding.
And so over time the people that leave 

1158
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:57,364
them,
that area we're trying to figure out 

1159
00:57:58,721 --> 00:58:03,721
like when he was doing it to find the 
schedule is something and then they were

1160
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:08,881
trying to get a picture of him so they 
could reveal who it was and it took them

1161
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:09,964
about a year until they figured out and 
like the time that it was usually doing 

1162
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:14,434
it and then they left.
They tried living like caroline has in 

1163
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:18,004
the area.
I want to see a documentary and 

1164
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:27,630
eventually this guy was waiting for him 
with the camera and when he was about to

1165
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:28,774
snap the picture there was like a red 
dot on the camera and he saw it and 

1166
00:58:31,961 --> 00:58:34,270
looked and that's when he took the 
picture.

1167
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:41,760
This is like a true crime.
Documentaries and what's the show

1168
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,380
that's like a parody of this scandal or 
whatever?

1169
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:45,740
Her vandal vandal.
Yeah.

1170
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,250
It almost seems straight out of that.
Totally.

1171
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,530
Did he like,
was it targeted?

1172
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:55,310
Was He trying to pool on specific 
peoples neighborhood,

1173
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:56,163
like your doors or he was just,
he just had like a weird thing outside 

1174
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:03,130
or something real.

1175
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,850
Can you see it as nuts or what?
No,

1176
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:10,600
I don't.
I don't think cause yeah,

1177
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,740
it probably just assume.
Let's just say no,

1178
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,790
it's his other leg now.
Yeah.

1179
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,230
I don't think he can see his nuts,
but there's,

1180
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,183
I mean that's,
there's a lot going on there that you 

1181
00:59:20,481 --> 00:59:22,940
can't see.
God the picture so good.

1182
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,830
His name is Andrew Mackintosh.
If you're an audio listener,

1183
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:29,750
you need to go google this immediately.
So,

1184
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,970
um,
what's the,

1185
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,520
what was the result of this 
investigation?

1186
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,700
Through take a picture.
He looks at him and just said,

1187
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:41,380
hello.
Wait,

1188
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:43,850
who said hello?
The pooper hello.

1189
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:45,883
Poo jogger.

1190
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,140
And then once this was released,
they like,

1191
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,393
it became viral and everyone knew it was
him and he was charged with a fine of 

1192
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:59,540
$378.
Oh,

1193
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:03,950
that's a small press brake light.
He lost his job.

1194
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,450
Okay.
There's a bomber.

1195
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,220
It was an executive,
you said,

1196
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:08,960
right?
He was on the city council.

1197
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,960
Public Servant.
Now it looks like I just googled,

1198
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:15,803
his name is,
he's a corporate executive and on the 

1199
01:00:17,871 --> 01:00:22,871
city council,
very upstanding in like every way.

1200
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:24,820
Such a perfect story,
isn't it?

1201
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,080
God,
what do you,

1202
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:30,640
where do you go from there to the 
sidewalk to let me know?

1203
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,473
There's one great to wade that someone 
made a jogger footage narrated by Devin 

1204
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:41,570
Davion national board.
Is there a video or just a,

1205
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:44,020
no,
just the photo today.

1206
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,640
You could see as the Australian puzzle 
jog,

1207
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:51,110
it comes out at 3:00
AM and shits on his neighbors grass.

1208
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,640
No one has found him and the wild until 
now.

1209
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:58,220
That that's beautiful thing.
That's it.

1210
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,600
There you have it.
Yellow,

1211
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,880
uh,
well,

1212
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:05,920
very well described the poo jogger.
Um,

1213
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,600
we are coming right along here on no 
means left behind.

1214
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:11,850
And we are certainly not least any of 
our Congress.

1215
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:15,230
The time certainly should not have been 
left behind cause that and it hasn't,

1216
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:16,640
that was amazed.
Not Anymore.

1217
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:21,530
You're up next with the wacky and wild 
world of a world record.

1218
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:23,090
Okay.
Yeah.

1219
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:25,953
So,

1220
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,070
so yeah,
w somehow this,

1221
01:01:32,071 --> 01:01:33,240
uh,
slipped through the cracks,

1222
01:01:33,241 --> 01:01:37,980
but even before looking for content for 
the show,

1223
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:38,843
I'm just like weird ass world records 
has always been really interesting to 

1224
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:42,750
me.
People that like,

1225
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,960
you know,
demonstrate some bizarre fucking skill.

1226
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,980
Um,
so there's,

1227
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,880
this is all going to build up to 
something,

1228
01:01:50,881 --> 01:01:52,170
but we'll,
we'll start a little slow.

1229
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:53,004
So this was a relatively recently,
it's got Eli Bishop held the world 

1230
01:01:58,291 --> 01:02:02,130
record for a number of claps in a 
minute.

1231
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,320
It's exciting.
Yeah.

1232
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:06,803
You can clap.
It's called speed clapping and 

1233
01:02:07,951 --> 01:02:09,660
apparently there's like this whole 
subculture.

1234
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,123
Well,
this is the current champion is a nine 

1235
01:02:13,051 --> 01:02:13,884
year old.
Whoa.

1236
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,890
This guy who has dedicated his life to 
it.

1237
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,050
Uh,
Mr Eli Bishop,

1238
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,890
he's like in his thirties or something,
owned by a nine year old.

1239
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:24,990
So yeah.
Here's,

1240
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,510
here's poor Eli.
I'm not no,

1241
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:28,680
get the hell out of here.
Facebook.

1242
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:31,901
Wow.
Yeah.

1243
01:02:31,901 --> 01:02:34,210
So this is actually kind of cool 
clapping.

1244
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,673
Yeah.
I find that they shoot it in high speed 

1245
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,930
so they can actually count each 
individual cow,

1246
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,430
uh,
slowed down.

1247
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:44,650
Yeah.
Within 60 seconds I was able to clap 120

1248
01:02:44,651 --> 01:02:45,490
times.
I'm like,

1249
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,990
he's beating off super fast.
Yeah.

1250
01:02:46,991 --> 01:02:49,630
It's kind of,
if you don't know what you're hearing,

1251
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:51,370
it's a little,
it's a little odd.

1252
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:55,860
A hundred or a thousand cars.
1024 live here.

1253
01:02:55,861 --> 01:02:57,540
I'm going to swelled records.
We're here.

1254
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,100
Nobody cares about this guy.

1255
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:02,090
He's not the world record anymore 
because this kid,

1256
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:03,723
this fucking nine year old,
a nine year old saw that video and was 

1257
01:03:06,621 --> 01:03:07,011
like,
wait,

1258
01:03:07,011 --> 01:03:08,530
I can do that.
Fuck that.

1259
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,500
Guttery yeah,

1260
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,970
just fucking dumb.
Whoa

1261
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:13,380
sky.
Okay,

1262
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,370
good idea.
We give this guy,

1263
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:21,050
that guy's like,
this is all I have is all I have.

1264
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,153
Which that's,
that's like the flip side to it is like 

1265
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,960
these people that have these odd skills.
Wait,

1266
01:03:26,961 --> 01:03:29,830
this kid's name is seven kid's name.
It's seven ways.

1267
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,570
Yup.
Seinfeld joke.

1268
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,040
Yeah.
Wait,

1269
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,180
what was,
is that dirt?

1270
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:36,043
Yeah,
sorry.

1271
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,190
Yeah.
Way.

1272
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,713
You know,
I was thinking about naming our first 

1273
01:03:41,831 --> 01:03:45,370
daughter Soda because I always thought 
that was a cute name.

1274
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:46,403
There's an episode of Seinfeld where 
George wants to name his kids seven and 

1275
01:03:49,031 --> 01:03:50,710
soda.
Know what happens tomorrow.

1276
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:51,743
One of them steal seven,
his cousin's still seven and this must 

1277
01:03:55,781 --> 01:03:58,570
have been inspired by by,
I didn't even think about that.

1278
01:03:58,571 --> 01:03:59,470
Seven.
Well,

1279
01:03:59,471 --> 01:04:02,290
no wonder he's such a superstars.
Parents are Seinfeld fans,

1280
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,150
good rocks.
And yeah,

1281
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:08,670
he got beat up by a faster though,
if I can say that.

1282
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:09,371
Yeah.
But,

1283
01:04:09,371 --> 01:04:09,550
uh,

1284
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,360
evidently this,
uh,

1285
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:15,160
they counted this and he did a 1080,
so 60 more claps in a second.

1286
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,170
It's a clap.
Well,

1287
01:04:17,171 --> 01:04:18,490
they,
they're doing some kind of,

1288
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:22,160
it counts like each percussion of it as 
an individual.

1289
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,490
Think he's hitting like there's lower.
Yeah.

1290
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,810
Okay.
Well,

1291
01:04:25,811 --> 01:04:27,430
everyone at home,
you want to,

1292
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:30,520
your path to stardom is very clear,
very simple.

1293
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,413
You just,
all you gotta do is on there you have 

1294
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:34,241
it.
I mean,

1295
01:04:34,241 --> 01:04:36,760
that one's pretty straight forward,
but now we'll get into the,

1296
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:38,270
to the hardship.
Mm.

1297
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,430
So,
um,

1298
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,950
this guy guerard Dani,
um,

1299
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:42,813
now he evidently has since broken the 
record since this video I'm about to 

1300
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:46,720
show you,
but there is no,

1301
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:50,410
there's no video of it.
It was a guinness verified thing,

1302
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:51,663
but

1303
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,410
there is apparently a record that 
exists.

1304
01:04:55,411 --> 01:04:57,720
He's a dream diocese.
It was on a German television show.

1305
01:04:57,721 --> 01:05:02,721
We did it most number of plungers stuck 
to someone's back.

1306
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,420
Why?
Why is that even a category?

1307
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,970
Right?
And so this is where it starts to get,

1308
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:10,640
like,
this is the beginning of the gate.

1309
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:14,050
Farnam here.
You,

1310
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,890
sorry,
I'm sorry.

1311
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,620
So record.
Right.

1312
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,490
And that's the thing.
Not only is there a record for this,

1313
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:25,324
but the record in 60 seconds,
which I guess this is more of just a 

1314
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:29,584
demonstration,
but this guy does have the record and 

1315
01:05:30,851 --> 01:05:32,500
the record is 15.
So bossy,

1316
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:34,150
not even like a lot,
right.

1317
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:35,543
Money.
He just throwing shit at these poor 

1318
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:39,670
guys.
I love it.

1319
01:05:39,671 --> 01:05:40,504
They're all in jeans flex and everybody 
reads once I got to say this is one of 

1320
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:47,850
the weirdest things I've ever seen.
Yeah.

1321
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:51,220
This is uh,
this is definitely a fetish.

1322
01:05:51,221 --> 01:05:52,054
Like their hot little twinks and they're
all in jeans and they're all wearing 

1323
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:57,790
motorcycle helmets.
We got to do it safely.

1324
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:00,840
Boom.
There it is.

1325
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,990
Really exciting.
Yeah.

1326
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,530
This,
this is uh,

1327
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,480
this is the,
uh,

1328
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:13,920
the kind of stuff that um,
you can go down in history for.

1329
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:14,843
I wonder how you practice for that.
Like do you call like your friends and 

1330
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:18,610
be like,
I need you for a second.

1331
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:20,780
Yeah.
I,

1332
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:24,780
interesting Gig craigslist.
Interesting Gig for an afternoon.

1333
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:26,400
Right?
50 bucks.

1334
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,570
So I need you to wear these jeans,
dad jeans and span populates.

1335
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:32,160
Why throw punches at you?
Cool.

1336
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:33,100
I'm into that,
nope.

1337
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,480
Here's the real shit.
You know what I want?

1338
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:39,090
How do these categories come into 
existence?

1339
01:06:39,091 --> 01:06:39,924
I know the Guinness World Record,
it has all these categories of feats 

1340
01:06:42,421 --> 01:06:43,254
that you can achieve,
but how does something like throwing a 

1341
01:06:46,021 --> 01:06:49,470
plunger out to dude,
I thought was that able to just pitch it

1342
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,440
to them?
Honestly,

1343
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,473
can you rate your own records?
There is an extraordinary thing I can 

1344
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:56,850
throw plungers that people make it stick
to them.

1345
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:58,403
And a,
you shouldn't be really like an ethnic 

1346
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,820
person to like pursue something so 
weird,

1347
01:07:02,821 --> 01:07:04,480
but make it a Guinness record,
right?

1348
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,373
Like,
well,

1349
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:07,650
it's making me think,
I wonder if I have any,

1350
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:11,310
that's where the talents that just 
haven't been pitched to them yet.

1351
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:12,360
Right,
exactly.

1352
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:13,763
Times masturbated in one day.
I wonder if that is a Guinness World 

1353
01:07:16,111 --> 01:07:17,850
Record,
you know?

1354
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:18,950
Hmm.
I'm going to look.

1355
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:23,190
Probably,
probably so I think I may be the,

1356
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:24,960
they're like 30.
I was like,

1357
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,010
Ugh,
I'd beat that.

1358
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:29,070
I'm at 50 these days.
So,

1359
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:29,993
um,
this one now what I found out is that 

1360
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,940
there's actually competing record 
organization.

1361
01:07:35,941 --> 01:07:37,630
Guinness is the famous one of course.
Um,

1362
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:41,550
but there's also record setter.
Apparently a competitor.

1363
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:42,570
Right?
A competitor.

1364
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:46,920
Now this guy is the guy from the 
Philippines.

1365
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:51,950
He set the record for the most lit 
candles extinguished by a fart lit.

1366
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:01,873
Whoa.

1367
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,073
Okay.

1368
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,160
Yeah.
Which again,

1369
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:11,950
it's like,
I feel like somebody could do better.

1370
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,780
Somebody out there in the audience.
You can,

1371
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:16,100
you could totally one up this even a 
smile.

1372
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,810
This is serious business.
Did I do it?

1373
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:21,800
Did I do it?
Yo Yo Yo,

1374
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:24,290
is this not just like expert village 
where you could just send that?

1375
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:28,910
Maybe y'all can I watch that again?
We got to roll that back.

1376
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:32,000
So the guys on his back and he's got 
like a horn,

1377
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:32,863
like a horn up to his asshole and he's 
doing power farts on five lit candles 

1378
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:39,830
and blowing them out of a time.
Boom.

1379
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,680
That sound is something in it.
Definitely.

1380
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:43,910
You're finished.
Yeah,

1381
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:48,800
I'm in.
Good God.

1382
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:54,490
I come on my pants every time I hear it 
because seriously is basis.

1383
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,140
So all of his ration.
Yeah.

1384
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:01,990
He's holding his sack by the way.
Got a hand on his showed.

1385
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:03,463
I don't know what that does,
but I'm sure it's part of his 

1386
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:06,320
superpowers.
Go get the right angle.

1387
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,780
I like that.
It's just like what?

1388
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,170
That's incredible.
I have got 10 weird sex records.

1389
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:13,010
Dan,
would you like to hear them?

1390
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:13,903
Yeah,
let's hear it.

1391
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:17,600
This is part two though.
I'm not got a good Paul here.

1392
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:18,703
Furthest ejaculation.
Woe is 19 feet longer than a stretch 

1393
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:25,990
limo.
What?

1394
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:29,000
19 feet?
18 feet.

1395
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:32,150
Nine inches.
Now that's a record.

1396
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,640
Yeah,
both orgasms in one hour.

1397
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:39,641
Here's the one that I was going for.
A record is a woman who had 134 over the

1398
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:46,580
course of our record for males.
Just 16.

1399
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:47,683
Hmm.
Huh?

1400
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,720
How do you even verify that?
Who's verifying?

1401
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:51,554
Yeah.
Well I've heard of women who have a 

1402
01:09:52,761 --> 01:09:53,594
disease where they,
it's actually like a psychological 

1403
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:56,323
problem where they can't stop.
Orgasming it seems like torture for 

1404
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:03,920
them.
But a 16 is the physical with a guy,

1405
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:06,990
you know,
you got a little something proven.

1406
01:10:06,991 --> 01:10:09,350
It actually can monitor heart rate and 
think,

1407
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,240
oh,
maybe they just thought this through.

1408
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:17,570
Well for Guinness World Record,
you get very seriously.

1409
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:19,610
Um,
what else?

1410
01:10:19,611 --> 01:10:20,900
You got?
16.

1411
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,570
I feel like I could give that a run.
That's the,

1412
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,650
an hour 16 in an hour.
I mean,

1413
01:10:27,651 --> 01:10:29,720
that's one every,
that's pretty quick.

1414
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:31,880
That's a lot.
Five minutes or something.

1415
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:33,133
I mean,
if you think you're up to the pit like 

1416
01:10:33,801 --> 01:10:34,634
10 and you die in an hour's pretty fuck,
well your Dick just becomes like super 

1417
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:41,600
numb.
Who'd of all life?

1418
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:43,550
16.
Huh?

1419
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:49,060
Honorable Mention is the official 
longest orgasm was recorded in 1966 when

1420
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:54,050
a woman had a 45 second orgasm that 
involve 25 individual contractions.

1421
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:57,230
Oh.
So the contractions is probably,

1422
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:59,750
they're able to monitor to that maybe 
man,

1423
01:10:59,751 --> 01:11:02,960
who fathered the most children?
69 kids.

1424
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,930
Uh Oh.
Oh,

1425
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:10,990
Mrs vast Sylvia is pregnancy prowess 
pales in comparison in the multiplying.

1426
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:13,793
Could you just read there's like a 
normal person the king of Morocco had 

1427
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:17,910
between,
uh,

1428
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,373
over his lifespan,
the king of Morocco fathered at least 

1429
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:24,460
114 children,
surely.

1430
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,400
Gangas con probably.
Okay.

1431
01:11:26,401 --> 01:11:27,540
Whatever.
This stopped being interesting.

1432
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:28,403
Go ahead Dan.

1433
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:31,460
Okay.

1434
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,410
All right.
So this all leads me to,

1435
01:11:33,411 --> 01:11:34,244
um,

1436
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,153
some of my favorite videos I've,
I've seen on the internet in a long 

1437
01:11:38,621 --> 01:11:39,600
time.
Um,

1438
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,700
so this is actually very recent,
um,

1439
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:45,350
back in September of this year,
um,

1440
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:47,100
this guy in India,
um,

1441
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:47,973
his name is Navin Kumar,
broke the world record for the most 

1442
01:11:53,801 --> 01:11:58,801
number of walnuts smashed with your 
forehead and other really competitive,

1443
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,860
well let me tell you,
I got news.

1444
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:06,220
It is very competitive.
There are a lot of guys facing this one.

1445
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:07,054
Yes.
So,

1446
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:08,780
so the previous record,
um,

1447
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:13,860
he broke this guy did a 217 and he broke
the previous record by 36.

1448
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,390
Um,
so smashed,

1449
01:12:16,391 --> 01:12:17,200
smashed it literally,

1450
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:22,200
literally fast.
Wow.

1451
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:30,480
This is super superpower.
Those nuts are really,

1452
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:36,080
you've got to go on it.
It's no joke.

1453
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,820
And at the end of this video,
you'll see,

1454
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:39,390
I mean his,
his forehead is like,

1455
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,090
oh no.
Like they're not be good.

1456
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:45,051
Well,
you know,

1457
01:12:45,051 --> 01:12:45,884
nfl players have like brain damage.
The shiny like this is a story about 

1458
01:12:48,951 --> 01:12:49,784
that on 60 minutes.
So Megan's smashing your head into a 

1459
01:12:52,071 --> 01:12:53,770
walnut,
like a thousand accounts.

1460
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:56,150
Well,
it's worth it for the glory.

1461
01:12:56,151 --> 01:12:56,984
I guess.
The grunts are really what makes it 

1462
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:06,410
good.
You don't have to do this.

1463
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:10,970
If you're like,
you lost some speed on that turn there.

1464
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:13,190
Really shouldn't.
They got get a longer table.

1465
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:19,100
You don't have to do this man yelling.
Right.

1466
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:24,350
You could do it.
That was a minute.

1467
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:28,400
Didn't quite make it the whole way,
but shake his hand.

1468
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:31,340
Oh yeah.
Wow.

1469
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:34,590
It's all very calm.
Don't imagine going

1470
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:37,110
through all of that TV camera there.
Yeah,

1471
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:37,880
I mean,
again,

1472
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,350
this was there and everything like this 
was all this was sanctioned.

1473
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,630
Um,
now imagine going through all of that.

1474
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:49,070
Only to have one month later.
Oh No,

1475
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:53,360
this is super competitive.
This is a,

1476
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,253
this guy's name is Mohammad old.
She didn't seem we should maybe have 

1477
01:13:56,661 --> 01:13:59,640
joey cells try to crack walnuts.
Oh,

1478
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:03,040
for the charity.
Like every one that he cracks his like,

1479
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:03,874
uh,
it's like more money that will don't do 

1480
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,110
too.
Yeah,

1481
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,460
but it's amazing.
That'll be so good.

1482
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:12,010
Maybe that's good one.
I'll see if he's

1483
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,690
down.
We can ask him anything.

1484
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,300
You're utterly,
he really is.

1485
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,340
He's,
especially for the sake of charity.

1486
01:14:18,341 --> 01:14:19,720
I mean he's got a sweetheart.
Yeah.

1487
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,460
Oh yeah.
So,

1488
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:23,150
um,
so not only did,

1489
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:26,800
so this guy that the previous guy,
I'm Navin,

1490
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,840
um,
did 217 this,

1491
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:33,460
this guy,
a 32 year old Mohammed Rashid Naseem um,

1492
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:38,590
managed to terrible.
I can already get a fancier table and if

1493
01:14:38,591 --> 01:14:42,400
you thought that last guys a sound 
effects,

1494
01:14:42,401 --> 01:14:44,110
his efforts were good.
You got here

1495
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:45,453
now are these tapes to the table?
Maybe there's like a little bit of 

1496
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:51,730
stickiness guys.
A genuine bro.

1497
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,033
You don't have to do this,
but these guys are practice this a lot 

1498
01:15:08,681 --> 01:15:09,700
too.
Yeah,

1499
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:13,040
you'd have to,
I guess it's core guy.

1500
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,960
Yes.
He got the right strategy.

1501
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:25,960
Any focusing his energy much,
much more strongly with that.

1502
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,730
Oh.
Oh,

1503
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:31,810
I didn't even see that.
Holy Shit.

1504
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:32,830
No.
Oh,

1505
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:34,570
they're all bloody now.
He's like,

1506
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,133
oh my God.
And Guinness approved that is fucking 

1507
01:15:46,331 --> 01:15:47,164
nuts.
He was about 150 deep and then just 

1508
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:54,580
suddenly every single one,
he's not stopping.

1509
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,790
He missed.
Oh my God.

1510
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:03,940
It is one where he missed the nut and 
slammed his head on the table.

1511
01:16:03,941 --> 01:16:08,740
And there was a huge spot.
My fucking lawyer,

1512
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,270

Seriously,

1513
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:13,230
did he get money?
Uh,

1514
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:16,480
I don't think there's any cash prize for
it's just the glory.

1515
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,730
Glory,

1516
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:24,420
He God keep the woman luxury book.
Yeah.

1517
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:26,710
Yeah.
Hard to watch.

1518
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I did not realize how you got that sound
effects that Oh my God,

1519
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,260
my God,
that's really hard to watch.

1520
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,153
Did you not notice that gruesome,
I didn't realize how gruesome that one 

1521
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:41,060
got.
I only discovered this one,

1522
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:41,963
uh,
this morning cause I was trying to find 

1523
01:16:43,971 --> 01:16:44,804
more info on that other one and saw the 
story that that was literally less than 

1524
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,753
a month later he got completely blown 
away by this guy threw a true expert 

1525
01:16:54,261 --> 01:16:55,270
pete with that.
No,

1526
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:56,443
that guy,
his,

1527
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:01,540
his mind and body and how he's exist 
solely to smash those nuts.

1528
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:02,953
That's why I'm wondering like how do you
get rewarded this guy not cracks or 

1529
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:08,431
work.
Yeah.

1530
01:17:08,431 --> 01:17:12,950
He knows you're right.
Do not crack at work.

1531
01:17:12,951 --> 01:17:13,784
He's like,
Yup,

1532
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:15,740
all the time.
What does he get?

1533
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:17,140
I know know what was there,
what does it stand?

1534
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:22,180
The descriptive book.
What's his actual Youtube Channel?

1535
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:23,384
I just really,
wow.

1536
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,600
Just has his Neri is,
can you show mark look,

1537
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:26,443
feel more?

1538
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,231
Uh,
yeah.

1539
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:28,064
Let's,
let's see what he has to say about the 

1540
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:34,780
category forwards and argued with that.
While that was really something.

1541
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:38,120
So there's a whole wide world of this 
and yeah,

1542
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:40,730
I dunno.
Like even though this is hilarious,

1543
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:46,330
I find something really interesting 
about people that choose to be excellent

1544
01:17:46,341 --> 01:17:48,860
at something so stupid.
You know what I mean?

1545
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,540
Like,
yeah,

1546
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:51,374
it's dumb.
But this guy is the best person on the 

1547
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:56,690
planet.
The wine walnuts with his forehead.

1548
01:17:56,691 --> 01:17:57,524
Yeah.
That would make an incredible 

1549
01:17:58,071 --> 01:17:58,904
documentary.
Don't think people that pursue becoming 

1550
01:18:01,821 --> 01:18:02,654
specialized,
hyper specialized in these one weird 

1551
01:18:05,601 --> 01:18:07,190
thing.
Little niche things.

1552
01:18:07,191 --> 01:18:08,870
Yeah.
That would be amazing,

1553
01:18:08,871 --> 01:18:10,070
man.
You got to Dan,

1554
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:14,830
you have a mission in life.
So I'm going to go out to a,

1555
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,550
I think this got all,
if you guys from Pakistan,

1556
01:18:16,551 --> 01:18:20,300
so you can't make it whole.
And then Joey Salads to do some on,

1557
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:21,560
on the scene reporting.
Yeah.

1558
01:18:21,561 --> 01:18:24,020
We'll have to see if he's a,
if he's good to go.

1559
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:25,611
So yeah,
that's it.

1560
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:28,070
That's a,
that's the wild and the world.

1561
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:29,940
I was wonderful and it's world record.
Wow.

1562
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,640
That was nuts,
ian coming in.

1563
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:33,770
Scott.
Wow.

1564
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,240
How long were you thinking of that?
Oh,

1565
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,083
like 10 minutes.

1566
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:43,210
Uh,
reporters destroying shit,

1567
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,053
dude.
Those games books were my favorite 

1568
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:48,440
thing.
Yeah.

1569
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:51,300
They're interested in.
Yeah.

1570
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,270
That's so cool.
Wow.

1571
01:18:53,271 --> 01:18:54,104
How do I top the nut?
Crack should have saved that for the 

1572
01:18:56,601 --> 01:18:58,510
end.
And I was incredible.

1573
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,150
I'm really enjoying this very special 
episode.

1574
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:06,020
Eight street podcast of leaving no man 
behind having a lot of fun out here.

1575
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,180
You know,
it had to be done.

1576
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,350
It had to be done.
That's good.

1577
01:19:09,351 --> 01:19:10,184
Not couldn't have happened.
It couldn't have been hidden from the 

1578
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:17,810
people all see a of the United States 
military is to leave no man behind.

1579
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,810
And it is our policy here on this 
podcast to leave.

1580
01:19:20,811 --> 01:19:23,420
No mean behind it.
We didn't have a choice.

1581
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:25,790
Yeah.
We didn't want to,

1582
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,250
I didn't want to go back and then have a
choice.

1583
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:30,410
Um,

1584
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:35,650
so here we have,
this is something that I've been working

1585
01:19:35,651 --> 01:19:36,484
on and thinking about for a long time.
There are these wonderful videos of 

1586
01:19:39,671 --> 01:19:44,671
reporters destroying shit.
Now the question that I have,

1587
01:19:46,361 --> 01:19:49,990
when you go deep down this rabbit hole 
of these goofy reporters,

1588
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:51,573
not walking into ice sculptures or 
knocking over whatever aunt during live 

1589
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:57,530
broadcasts,
it's sick.

1590
01:19:57,550 --> 01:20:01,080
It's always the same guy kind of.
Well,

1591
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:06,090
there is duplicates and so I'm wondering
is this fake real?

1592
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,100
Is this because these are

1593
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:13,220
old clips?
Is this viral cause if it's fake,

1594
01:20:14,611 --> 01:20:16,530
this guy's like a genius.
Before,

1595
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:19,890
before it was a thing.
So let me get into this here.

1596
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:20,933
This is the guy in question team known 
worldwide for their bubble artistry is 

1597
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:27,600
attempting to burst the bubble world 
records.

1598
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,840
They helped to set a new Guinness record
for the most people that wow,

1599
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,720
I meant to do that.
Reporter David is our,

1600
01:20:35,721 --> 01:20:38,100
is covering the bubble story from the 
inside.

1601
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,630
Yes.
This guy.

1602
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,150
Okay.
And at an Aa on,

1603
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:43,993
as you say,
we are here at the Discovery Science 

1604
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,990
Center in Santa Ana.
All things science,

1605
01:20:47,991 --> 01:20:49,430
entertainment,
education,

1606
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:50,533
technology.
The event going on the next three weeks 

1607
01:20:53,241 --> 01:20:54,920
here is really unbelievable.
No,

1608
01:20:54,921 --> 01:20:59,360
not unbelievable on believable.
And we're about to explain why all these

1609
01:20:59,361 --> 01:21:00,194
good folks here are getting in a giant 
size bubble to try and get the Guinness 

1610
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:09,290
World Record.
George over here to introduce you to fan

1611
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:10,124
Yang who was under sneakiness level fan.
Thank you so much for being here and 

1612
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:15,794
what is going on Big Ben.
This is going to be a Guinness World 

1613
01:21:18,091 --> 01:21:20,430
Record for the most number of people 
inside the bubble.

1614
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:21,293
We have 150 people here,
right when the platform to be inside a 

1615
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:25,620
giant Bobby Rail,
right?

1616
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:26,553
150 people.
So far the world record is 90 people in 

1617
01:21:29,741 --> 01:21:33,270
a bubble to Guinness.
The judges are standing by to documents.

1618
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:34,980
Yeah,
that's correct.

1619
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:37,130
We have a Guinea Sport Echo Jetta right 
there.

1620
01:21:37,131 --> 01:21:40,620
So we are ready to go.
How does one get involved in bubbles?

1621
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:43,310
What is the dynamic behind all this?
Well,

1622
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:47,350
this all come from my childhood.
I was fascinated by the bubbles floating

1623
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,193
on the surface of the river when I was 
six years old and then when I was 18 

1624
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:52,350
years,
I start to experiment.

1625
01:21:52,351 --> 01:21:55,110
It's various liquid solution just to 
make the largest possible,

1626
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:57,590
both amateurs and in both getting on is 
my passion.

1627
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,970
And today I'm the bubble artist and 
bubbles scientists.

1628
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,313
And do I understand correctly,
you've been working on this for years 

1629
01:22:04,081 --> 01:22:04,914
and it's some sort of secret mixture,
70% water and 30% you don't like to 

1630
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:11,060
tell,
uh,

1631
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,630
I have a or develop over the past 27 
years old.

1632
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:20,670
Come on.
Soapy solution is 70% tactical,

1633
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:27,590
sent his secret ingredients.
So here as just so no mistake.

1634
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:29,983
Yeah,
we cannot make a mistakes because we'd 

1635
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:33,890
have a one attempt and just we have to 
make it right.

1636
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:36,290
Cute.
Georgia this way.

1637
01:22:36,291 --> 01:22:40,250
I want to introduce you to Aaron Rhodes.
Erin with a discovery science center.

1638
01:22:40,251 --> 01:22:42,350
Thank you for being here.
You're welcome here.

1639
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,080
And why is this important?
Obviously it's fun and festivity,

1640
01:22:45,081 --> 01:22:47,540
but what is the deal with science and 
bubbles?

1641
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:51,430
Everything we do at the science center 
tries to combine science with,

1642
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:52,820
I mean,
Oscar's science center.

1643

Thank you so much.
It was very real.

1644

Thank you.

1651
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,200
Okay,
so we are ready to go.

1652
01:23:11,201 --> 01:23:13,740
And can you just step a little bit back?
So just yet,

1653
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:24,960
sorry.
I'm sorry.

1654
01:23:24,961 --> 01:23:25,794
I'm sorry.
Broke the bubble and they only have one 

1655
01:23:32,151 --> 01:23:32,984
chance.
He said,

1656
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,770
although I don't know why you would only
have one chance,

1657
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:37,560
but I'm not above it.
Sorry.

1658
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:39,110
Sorry about that.
Can you?

1659
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:44,190
No,
it was very real life.

1660
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:45,580
And we'll send it back to you.
Sorry.

1661
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:47,110
Oh my God.

1662
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:55,140
Big.
They're all like unbelievably good at,

1663
01:23:55,141 --> 01:23:55,230
yeah.

1664
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:57,240
Okay.
So I have a theory,

1665
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,480
Tim.
Hi Decker moment.

1666
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:07,110
He's apologizes to the new bank.
Sorry.

1667
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,153
Sorry about that.

1668
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:14,920
Sorry I had an animal.
Send it back to you.

1669
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:17,640
Sorry.
Okay,

1670
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,380
so there you have,
it looks real.

1671
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:21,763
I have a feeling it's fake.
Really like the one time only thing 

1672
01:24:26,051 --> 01:24:26,884
seems suspicious to me now.
Why would you only be able to do it 

1673
01:24:29,051 --> 01:24:31,380
once?
Okay.

1674
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,313
There's an explanation on to exhibit B 
and thank you for supporting me in this 

1675
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:40,240
pursuit.
Now go.

1676
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:45,120
I'll fast forward to another reporter.
Goofs and what?

1677
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,920
You know,
it's this same reporter,

1678
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:51,790
another live broadcast with the ice 
sculpture.

1679
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,433
Okay.
How I saw that first few days I was 

1680
01:24:54,971 --> 01:24:55,421
like,
wow,

1681
01:24:55,421 --> 01:24:57,970
this is incredible.
This is real.

1682
01:24:57,971 --> 01:24:58,804
This is real stuff.
When I saw this clip and threw 

1683
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:07,270
everything into question,
here we go.

1684
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,750
Your prize possessions.
Oh yeah.

1685
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,110
This is a Barocas Cherub.
It's,

1686
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:12,850
it's actually been a very tough piece to
do.

1687
01:25:12,851 --> 01:25:14,530
We've been working on it for about eight
hours right now.

1688
01:25:14,531 --> 01:25:16,240
We still got quite a ways to go on it.
Beautiful.

1689
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:20,570
Yes.
Can I take a closer look at this?

1690
01:25:20,571 --> 01:25:21,910
Because why is this your,
Oh,

1691
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,620
oh my God,
I am so sorry.

1692
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:26,760
So intentional.
I'm so sorry.

1693
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,380
I'm so sorry.
It was just an accident.

1694
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:32,870
We'll talk to management

1695
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,370
fake or not.
It's fucking hilarious.

1696
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,590
I agree.
But watch his hand.

1697
01:25:40,591 --> 01:25:41,424
Okay.
Now he puts his hand and he seems to 

1698
01:25:44,461 --> 01:25:46,740
really push it.
Oh my God,

1699
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:51,210
I am so sorry.
I love how he puts the mic in his face,

1700
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,680
like he get his answer.

1701
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:54,610
So sorry dude,
are you serious?

1702
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,100
I'm so sorry.
It was just an accident.

1703
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:03,380
We'll talk to management.
I'm tired of guys out of here.

1704
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:05,631
We'll,
we'll,

1705
01:26:05,631 --> 01:26:10,631
we'll get this taken care of and what 
exactly anyway with a smile on my face.

1706
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:14,930
So I'll send it back to you at an a on.
That's the same guy.

1707
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,910
Same Guy.
Yeah.

1708
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:22,250
So one theory that I've worked on is 
that the first one was real,

1709
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:25,760
second one was a fake to try to turn it 
into a thing.

1710
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,370
Oh,
that's interesting.

1711
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,960
That's his thing,
right?

1712
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:34,970
That being said,
the first one,

1713
01:26:34,971 --> 01:26:35,804
there seemed to be a lot more 
humiliation and shame and there was so 

1714
01:26:38,931 --> 01:26:41,060
much with all the buildup to yeah,
exactly.

1715
01:26:41,061 --> 01:26:44,750
And there was tons of people there.
That's just some local news channel.

1716
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:49,250
So yeah,
there are a lot of moving parts.

1717
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,600
It would be,
did you know,

1718
01:26:50,601 --> 01:26:52,390
it's pretty impressive.
That's a big,

1719
01:26:52,391 --> 01:26:56,180
a big effort.
Just for a little gag regardless.

1720
01:26:56,181 --> 01:26:58,240
It is fascinating.
I think what you said,

1721
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:01,880
I think,
I think the original probably was real.

1722
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:02,773
And then it just became his,
his signature thing to fuck shit up 

1723
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:06,883
cause he had,
the way he handled it the second time 

1724
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:09,374
was very different.
Although he is a pro at this point of 

1725
01:27:11,301 --> 01:27:14,330
ruining things.
But now I have a bonus,

1726
01:27:14,331 --> 01:27:15,164
um,
a bonus clip for you all and you can 

1727
01:27:16,551 --> 01:27:18,650
tell me if you think this one is real or
fake.

1728
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:19,484
And it's another classic by the way.
I just checked and stress warrant 

1729
01:27:22,641 --> 01:27:23,840
record.
They don't pay.

1730
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:26,870
They weren't giving us,
it doesn't pay.

1731
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:29,870
What does those nut guys,
they don't even cover expenses.

1732
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:33,380
Oh you have to pay.
That's right.

1733
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:36,040
We were trying to get again,
this person out for something we did.

1734
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:39,800
What was it?
The va number of shirts.

1735
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:40,873
Oh No,
the vein were to make like the biggest 

1736
01:27:43,971 --> 01:27:46,610
vape.
Oh right.

1737
01:27:46,611 --> 01:27:49,040
The thing is you have to pay them to 
come out.

1738
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:52,130
Right.
Which I guess makes sense.

1739
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:54,860
Said some of it is people look pretty 
broke on it.

1740
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:56,143
That's like the nuts to have table.
I don't think I was with Guinness 

1741
01:28:01,221 --> 01:28:02,330
though.
The the not one.

1742
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:02,751
No,
it was,

1743
01:28:02,751 --> 01:28:03,584
it was,
it was,

1744
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,250
yeah.
They had the banner behind them.

1745
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:07,580
Oh yeah,
no there were,

1746
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:10,850
that was officially sanctioned.
I'm almost paid to be there.

1747
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:15,680
But that being said,
we've got a really classic,

1748
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:17,650
this is classic per year,
uh,

1749
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,360
entertainment and judge we

1750
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,970
really want to show you is right over 
here.

1751
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,350
This is the leaning tower of Pisa campus
here.

1752
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:29,230
And uh,
the person that's built is riding around

1753
01:28:29,231 --> 01:28:34,120
the corner here was cables wrapped 
around Bryan Barney Hill.

1754
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:39,840
Oh God.
1990 graduate of northern and uh,

1755
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:46,000
he's gonna tell us a little bit about 
this amazing structure.

1756
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:47,653
Well,
as you can see the leaning tower of 

1757
01:28:49,661 --> 01:28:52,150
Pisa,
it's about 12,000

1758
01:28:52,151 --> 01:28:52,984
blocks.
It took over two weekends to build and 

1759
01:28:56,681 --> 01:28:58,810
I'm,
I'm really excited because next week,

1760
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:02,040
uh,
the Guinness Book World Records Team are

1761
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:04,560
going to come to evaluate it and really 
looking forward to that.

1762
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:08,330
What?
Hello?

1763
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:19,060
I'm too much of a scratch off.
I feel like even this holds vague.

1764
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,480
Are you about this?
He thinks,

1765
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:23,373
I guess.

1766
01:29:26,370 --> 01:29:27,150
Yeah.
Well,

1767
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:30,180
no,
I think if it's fake that they built it,

1768
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,790
had the purpose of it though it off and 
then they wanted to,

1769
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,500
well they wanted to,
you know,

1770
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:41,760
have a gag while destroying it.
Um,

1771
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:47,330
but either way it's a,
it's a joy to be holding it either way.

1772
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:54,930
Okay.
So what else we got here?

1773
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:57,840
Um,
we've got a bunch of leftover videos and

1774
01:29:57,841 --> 01:29:59,550
stuff,
but everyone's done their segment.

1775
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:04,380
We've saved a lot of memes here today.
We've done a service.

1776
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:05,453
We've,
I feel like we all deserve a purple 

1777
01:30:06,811 --> 01:30:07,644
heart.
Yeah.

1778
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:12,830
Um,
well we did it.

1779
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:15,320
We did it and that was good.
We came,

1780
01:30:15,321 --> 01:30:16,610
we saw,
we went to war,

1781
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:17,444
we went behind enemy lines and we've 
saved some really valuable or worthy 

1782
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:21,860
means.
Pulled them out of the shit.

1783
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:23,300
Yeah,
that was special.

1784
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:28,220
So thank you guys are joining us on this
special episode of a no man left behind.

1785
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:32,390
We will be back on Friday as usual next 
Friday.

1786
01:30:32,391 --> 01:30:34,670
Bill Works is here.
Very excited about that.

1787
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:35,990
And,
uh,

1788
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:38,810
thank you so much to the illustrious and
Ian,

1789
01:30:38,811 --> 01:30:39,644
of course,
who with whom to show would not be the 

1790
01:30:43,551 --> 01:30:46,880
same without true.
Can I say that?

1791
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:48,020
Yeah,
I would say that.

1792
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,660
Yeah,
for sure.

1793
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:57,100
So Ian,
I wanted to get back to something.

1794
01:30:57,101 --> 01:30:59,770
You were a fan when you joined.
Yeah.

1795
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:00,693
But are you still a fan?
Do you hate me now that you've worked 

1796
01:31:03,611 --> 01:31:04,444
with,
first of all,

1797
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,190
when the shit hits the fan or are you 
still,

1798
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,510
I'm still a fan.
I do still enjoy it.

1799
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:11,600
And you would lie to me.
Okay.

1800
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:15,940
Well I have to watch every episode and I
don't hate it.

1801
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:16,440
Yeah.
Okay.

1802
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,830
I don't hate to call.
That's the best.

1803
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,560
That's the best you can say about this 
podcast.

1804
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:21,510
I don't hate,
I don't hate it.

1805
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:24,040
You had a year,
but she'd be the slogan.

1806
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,520
I don't hate it.
I hate it.

1807
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,770
I don't hate you either.
Thank you.

1808
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,440
All right guys.
See you on Friday.

1809
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:35,280
Have a great thanksgiving by the way.
Awesome.

1810
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:36,760
That's true.
And um,

1811
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:39,250
in fact,
I'm going to step it up in front.

1812
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:40,940
Have a blessing giving.
Wow.

1813
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,050
Continued to send this fence,
submissions,

1814
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:48,010
podcasts at Atrius rubric and the Gun.
And we got some good ones.

1815
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:49,483
Good.
If you guys plan on breaking a Guinness 

1816
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:56,130
World Record,
let us know all officiate it.

1817
01:31:56,770 --> 01:31:57,940
Save some money.
I'll come,

1818
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,100
we'll cover us and all of things.
And the

1819
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,750
uh,
the charity one,

1820
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:06,900
that's 21st December 1st and I think 
joey sells it and I'm going to ask if he

1821
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:10,060
wants to crack some nuts with his head 
cause that'd be amazing.

1822
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,010
I'll give a shot to one.
Oh,

1823
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:16,480
I think I'm going to regret that.
I don't have,

1824
01:32:16,481 --> 01:32:17,314
I don't think I have the will to 
overcome the urge to not slam your head 

1825
01:32:21,641 --> 01:32:23,620
into it.
Not as hard as you can.

1826
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:25,420
Yeah.
And I think if you,

1827
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,340
if you hesitate at all,
it's going to hurt way worse.

1828
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:29,080
It's like breaking a board if you've 
ever done that.

1829
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:31,090
Like if you,
if you pull your punch at all,

1830
01:32:31,091 --> 01:32:33,230
you break your knuckles,
but if you just go for it,

1831
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:34,150
really,
you're all good.

1832
01:32:34,151 --> 01:32:34,984
Yeah.
Yeah.

1833
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:36,243
Boy.
Howdy.

1834
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,520
I break boards all the time.
I mean,

1835
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:38,800
it's no big deal.
Yeah.

1836
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:40,530
Alrighty.
Um,

1837
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:45,340
thank you guys for watching and we shall
see you on the next episode of Friday.

1838
01:32:45,341 --> 01:32:46,840
Happy thanksgiving.
Everybody.
