1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,930
No,
but you need more orange.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,280
Welcome everybody

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,170
to the h three podcasts experience.
So great to have you with us.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,010
Great.
Does see that.

5
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:19,440
If you look really beautiful today with 
your Auntie and great idea,

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,230
I switched like three buildings until I 
decided on the orange.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,960
The orange looks great and I want to 
thank our sponsors today.

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,410
Stitch fix or ring seatgeek end quid 
today.

9
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:33,610
We've got a whole slew of juicy topics 
to get to,

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,210
including Greg Paul,
the father of Jake and Logan.

11
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:42,211
Paul has not only made a tape and what 
she is having a,

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,270
how do I say this without getting in 
trouble with youtube where a,

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,133
he's uh,
his Janet Ohs is going into a female 

14
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:52,930
genitals.
People have speculated that this tape,

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,080
that it records his gentleman was going 
into another person's gender roles.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,940
Sex tape.
You could say sex tape.

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,530
Yeah.
It's like save time.

18
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:00,550
Right?
That's the,

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,070
I don't know.
Um,

20
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,800
he's had,
people are speculating.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,990
That's an underage girl.
There's no evidence of that at all.

22
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,990
Why is it still called a tape?
It's not really a tape.

23
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:11,910
Is it?
Hmm.

24
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,293
We need to update that sex footage.
Vid tape sounds a little more like 

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,290
hidden away though.
It's like,

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,910
oh,
I got that tape in my pocket.

27
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,820
But really it's just on your phone.
Yeah.

28
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,110
So it's not that fun anymore,
but sex tape,

29
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:29,110
it still is.
Sec State be up a post.

30
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:33,070
Malone has apparently been cursed.
I love this story.

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,980
It's great.
And of course the Hilarious,

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,460
hilarious antics of reporters from the 
recent hurricane.

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,310
Um,
there's a new trend and not really a new

34
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,144
trend.
They've been doing it for ages where 

35
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:47,590
they just stand and hurricanes and it's 
hilarious.

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,770
And I've put together a whole thing.
So these are this,

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,910
this,
and so much more.

38
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:56,140
Welcome everybody to the age three buck 
gas beyond the experience.

39
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,663
Fully enlightened.
I'm your host Ethan client with the 

40
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:01,510
beautiful,
talented,

41
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,210
lovely,
incredible levine.

42
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,293
He look like.

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,350
Thank you.
Love of my life.

44
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,820
Beautiful.
Whoa.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,590
So good that well

46
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,510
enough about Ila.
Let's get to the one person in the world

47
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,540
who turns me on even more.
Greg Paul now.

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,900
Okay.
So let's start from the top because this

49
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:30,734
is a whole story that's kind of develop.
So I want to explain to you guys from 

50
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,910
the top what happened.
Okay.

51
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,160
Now,
first of all,

52
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,140
I think the first thing that happened in
Dan,

53
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:43,500
correct me if I'm wrong on anything,
but I think I've got my facts straight,

54
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,050
is that Logan Paul's channel was hacked.
Hmm.

55
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,330
And the attacker,
uh,

56
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,590
uploaded a basically a fake iphone 
giveaway,

57
00:02:55,591 --> 00:03:00,280
which is honestly not that much of a 
departure from his usual content.

58
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,840
So I'm surprised anyone even noticed 
because they took it down really fast.

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,913
Click the link in the description to 
claim your free iphone x giving away 

60
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,000
1500.
I iphones.

61
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,883
Apparently people were clicking this 
link and just getting like straight up 

62
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,440
key loggers and viruses,
which is great.

63
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,423
You know,
all the best stuff on the Internet has 

64
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,254
to offer.

65
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,180
So that got taken down pretty quickly.
And um,

66
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,143
on Sunday the hackers released jake 
pauls calendar via their twitter pages 

67
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,600
since been banned.
It included the address and contact info

68
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,120
for many celebrities,
including Justin Bieber.

69
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,310
Yikes.
And what was thought?

70
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,790
This is a great twist thought to be 
Ethan me,

71
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,690
of course.
That's me.

72
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,560
Um,
when Jake Paul was on our podcast,

73
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,843
he saved a dance number because he had a
pre show call with Dan and he saved it 

74
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,114
as h three h three.
So Dan's phone number was leaked over a 

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,890
blowing up with a phone call.
That was fun.

76
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,200
Tell me about that then.
Um,

77
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,030
it was a Sunday afternoon,
um,

78
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,933
was just chilling at home and all of a 
sudden get a call from an unknown 

79
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,611
number.
Oh,

80
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,870
that's weird.
You answered it.

81
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,100
No,
I ignored it.

82
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,980
What kind of maniac answers don't know 
numbers in 2018.

83
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,530
Yeah,
absolutely.

84
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,300
But as soon as it ended,
uh,

85
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:27,170
another one and then another one,
another one,

86
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:28,810
and pretty quickly I was like,
okay,

87
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,970
something,
something happened and this is,

88
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,890
this is not normal.
And uh,

89
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:33,724
yeah,
just tracked it down to the old Jakey 

90
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:37,210
poop.
Did you not answer one of the calls?

91
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,321
No.
No.

92
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,000
And I didn't get any texts or anything.
Yeah.

93
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,440
Texts.
Well again,

94
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,274
because they thought it was you.
So it was just all kinds of people 

95
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,370
saying what's up Ethan?
And like all kinds of messages for you.

96
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,340
So anything interesting to know?
No.

97
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,820
Really nothing interesting at all,
which I mean these people,

98
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,430
it's like you get ahold of a number of a
famous person,

99
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,980
they have no idea what to say.
You're just calling the call.

100
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,173
I'll say when I'm on my phone number got
leaked previously when we got hacked 

101
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:07,680
dealer and they posted our phone number 
on twitter and we were,

102
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,663
we were pro,
I swear to God we're getting like a 

103
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,810
hundred calls a minute.

104
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,460
Fun Ways.
Actually it,

105
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,523
I can't,
I couldn't access my phone cause there 

106
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:19,060
was just incoming calls nonstop.
You couldn't like swipe it open.

107
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,313
I couldn't even do anything.
But I was getting tons of text messages 

108
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,640
and I don't think I actually ever told 
you this,

109
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,683
but somebody sent me,
I don't know why I even open text 

110
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:28,654
message cause I was generally not.
But one of them was a dick pic and I 

111
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:34,300
have to tell you,
I did feel violated.

112
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,673
And in that moment I had a,
I had a moment of like empathy and 

113
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:43,180
sympathy for all the females out there 
getting unsolicited dick pics because it

114
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,010
felt,
it felt very,

115
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,010
I felt very violated that I saw this 
man.

116
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:50,320
He was a fat man with the tiny small 
penis.

117
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,860
It looked almost like my own,
if I'm being honest,

118
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:53,694
a tiny little penis.
The pubes were much longer than the 

119
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:57,140
penis itself and I was like,
whoa.

120
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,820
Is that a picture I took?
No,

121
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,890
it was someone sending me their own.
So,

122
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,853
um,
and that you would think it was his 

123
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,130
fixture and not something off the 
Internet?

124
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,971
No,
it was definitely,

125
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:10,070
dude just snapped his junk and send it 
to me.

126
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,160
Yeah.
So there's a fat chubby little penis.

127
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,243
I was me to it.
I've been trying to tell you that for a 

128
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,830
long time.
I'm trying to take back.

129
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:20,300
Me Too,
for us,

130
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,070
for me meat anyway,
apparently me third,

131
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,110
apparently the hacker,
this,

132
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:27,944
this kind of perplexes me,
this hacker gotten to Jake Logan and 

133
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,380
their father's account,
all three.

134
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,890
Like,
I mean these guys are big shots.

135
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,410
They had run big companies.
How first of all,

136
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:43,700
is there security,
not tighter run third of all,

137
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:46,040
how do you get into all three of them at
the same time?

138
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:46,874
What I was wondering is are they still 
all on the same family plan at Verizon 

139
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,950
or some shit?
You know what I mean?

140
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,200
Like how do you explain that they got 
all three of their account?

141
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,450
Fascinating stuff.
Well,

142
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:02,120
regardless of how it happened,
um,

143
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,490
it could only happen to these geniuses.
Um,

144
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,583
apparently just so in Jake's dms,
there was all kinds of stuff of him 

145
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:14,400
flirting with girls.
I don't know,

146
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,870
they teased all kinds of stuff,
but they didn't show anything.

147
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:18,704
So I don't know.
But definitely the most fucked up thing 

148
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:24,731
to come out of it by far was the Greg 
Paul sex tape.

149
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:27,920
Greg Paul being the father.
Um,

150
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,530
this guy's a piece of work,
man.

151
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,783
Greg Paul's the guy who has notoriously 
made out with little girls and one of 

152
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:37,234
Jake's videos kiss.
I mean there might have been and he 

153
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,350
seems he wears a,
he's,

154
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,800
he's 40.
How old is he,

155
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:46,780
Danny?
He's like 40,

156
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,930
50,
54.

157
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:48,680
Yeah,
I think that's right.

158
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,513
I mean here,
here's all you need to know about the 

159
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,400
guy.
He's a 54 year old man with a puka shell

160
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:57,210
necklace and a goatee.
I mean that's a,

161
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,920
it says all you need.
Hit me with some of those soundbites,

162
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,320
which is that [inaudible]

163
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,610
gp coming at Ya GP.
He's coming at Ya two talks.

164
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
He like lowers his voice,

165
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,650
talks like a 19 year old irritation of 
his sons.

166
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:15,484
Yeah.

167
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,490
Yo.
Hey Yo,

168
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:20,170
is jp coming at Cha?
Ooh,

169
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,410
what's going on?

170
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,550
He's auditioning for the new blues clues
open.

171
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,550
Uh,
anyway,

172
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,190
so,
so there was a sex tape,

173
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,630
but there's no faces.
There's some voices,

174
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:37,464
obviously the girl herself.
There's no way of knowing her age or 

175
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:43,950
identity,
which is good for her.

176
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:47,460
Thank God for that.
I mean it's so graphic you guys.

177
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,400
I've watched a lot of porn in my day.
A lot of porn.

178
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,000
I mean emphasize a lot of foreign in my 
day.

179
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,090
This is one of the most things I've ever
seen in my life.

180
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:58,000
I mean,
it is horrible.

181
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,000
Mba was horrifying,
truly horrific.

182
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,750
Let me play you a little soundbite.
The lovely thing was that it was just on

183
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,584
twitter and like I just saw people 
talking about it going up the thread of 

184
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:15,040
a conversation.
It's just they're on twitter and yeah,

185
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:20,041
that's how I saw it first till.
But I saw what I saw was like him,

186
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,840
like fingering her.

187
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,633
But then I do my research.
I watched the whole thing on one of 

188
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:28,194
these,
uh,

189
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,180
you know,
websites and it is old graphic brothers.

190
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:36,480
The one scene where he's slapping her 
with his Dick,

191
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,120
I'm going to use,
I'm going to use a PC words here because

192
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:43,500
we are family friendly show.
He uses his a carrot.

193
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,050
He,
he puts his care and her soil.

194
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,513
But what happens is he's slapping her,
slapping her peace with this carrot and 

195
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:57,180
she starts to water his carrot.
He,

196
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,330
she pees on his dick.
I swear to God,

197
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:03,960
she pees on his dick.
And this is the sound that it makes this

198
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:05,790
sound from the video.
She pees on his dick.

199
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:10,320
I swear to God.
So he's slapping her and she's paying on

200
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,420
his deck.
Do you think,

201
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,480
Eh,
Fmr people would love this sound.

202
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,250
[inaudible] Greg Faull sex dig a smrs 
interested.

203
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,020
Let me try to experience stuff that 
space tomorrow.

204
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,910
I'm definitely getting the tone alone.
I'm still in a tingle and my forehead.

205
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,080
Um,
so this video is so graphic.

206
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,190
Um,
but again,

207
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,910
there's no,
there's nothing identifying the man or,

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,880
or the female.
So my first thought was that,

209
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,620
okay,
it could be anyone.

210
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,780
Let's look,
first of all,

211
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,450
I want to see is this actually Greg 
Paul?

212
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:56,190
Not that I'm not willing to believe it.
I mean I'm very willing to believe it,

213
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,610
but I just want to know what's my hunch.
So here we've got some evidence here.

214
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,560
Um,
let me see here.

215
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,560
Um,
he ready to come again.

216
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,990
Definitely sounds like a hit me with the
Hemi with that Zach could be,

217
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,083
but I will.
Here we do a little CSI photo matching 

218
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:28,890
and this is fairly conclusive in my 
opinion.

219
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,800
Um,
here it's hard to tell.

220
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,850
Okay.
But like,

221
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,043
here's a,
from his instagram has dog sleeping on 

222
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:37,584
his bed.
Now what we're paying our attention to 

223
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:43,110
is this floral kind of pattern here in 
the woodwork.

224
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:44,630
And you can tell.
I know it's,

225
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,350
I know this doesn't look that good.
Okay.

226
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,880
Not,
but I'm telling you,

227
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,610
I've watched the videos,
there's better screenshots,

228
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,653
but it definitely,
it matches it's the same ad board and 

229
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,923
when it's in motion in the video,
a lot more evidence that it's the same 

230
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,530
thing.
It's definitely the same.

231
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,650
So what do you think is happening?
But um,

232
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,420
I thought I had more evidence than that.

233
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,550
Okay.

234
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,830
Well let's leave the evidence I've got.
Okay.

235
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,400
It's okay.
Let me say this.

236
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,080
It's definitely the same headboard

237
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,530
and European and my humble alleged 
opinion.

238
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,850
It's not even an opinion.
It's an alleged that your opinion sir,

239
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,480
allegedly,
um,

240
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,790
under age though.
I mean,

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,220
who could ever say that that's 
dangerous?

242
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,420
Yeah.
I don't,

243
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:35,150
I don't want to put out the guys having 
sex with underage girls.

244
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:35,984
I will believe him.
He was having what I would it be a 

245
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:42,320
stretch of my imagination to think that 
greg was having sex on average girls?

246
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,770
No,
absolutely not because of him kissing.

247
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,490
Absolutely not.
Um,

248
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,790
but what,
what she had happened.

249
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,110
Cause it's,
if,

250
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:56,450
what if he was what it's from some 
hackers.

251
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,910
Well.
Yeah,

252
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,570
the first thought I had was like,
that's not,

253
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,920
you can't really use that as evidence in
court because it's illegally obtained.

254
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,710
Yeah.
Well regardless,

255
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,810
there's no evidence to disclose under 
age at all.

256
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:09,980
So,
um,

257
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,160
I don't want to insinuate that now.
Basically though,

258
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:13,994
Greg has acknowledged that the hack has 
happened in this instagram video in 

259
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:20,810
which I will play for you all here 
today.

260
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,663
Just some little,
some they'll tell you over as I opened 

261
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:29,150
this,
by the way,

262
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:34,151
Greg is a high level instagram user.
He starts the video with,

263
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,503
he got a paper bag from like Ralph's 
supermarket and he just sharpied a 

264
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,170
message so that this would be the 
thumbnail.

265
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,490
It's very creative.
I am calling you.

266
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,480
He's high level.
Good.

267
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,490
He learned it from all the teenage 
girls.

268
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:47,920
He fucks allegedly.

269
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,433
Okay.

270
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,680
Allegedly I don't even have an opinion.
I haven't alleged opinion.

271
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,383
Uh,
my hacker thought my hacker taught me a 

272
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,294
lot.
Please contact me so I can hire you or 

273
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:02,454
you couldn't find a piece of paper.
Really had to use a Ralph's shopping 

274
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:07,580
bag.
Alright,

275
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,850
let's watch this and try this.

276
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,753
Yeah.

277
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,780
Oh,
his GP,

278
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,520
gp here.

279
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,300
GP coming at Ya [inaudible] come again.
Come again.

280
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,020
Come again.
Should I be coming at you?

281
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,233
All right.
So how do you guys know that I was 

282
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:27,271
hacked?
By the way?

283
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:29,130
This hacker dude is something else,
man.

284
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:31,430
He is crazy smart.
I learned a lot.

285
00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:31,540
Hi.

286
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,380
Sounds like such a fucking,
he sounds like he's 15.

287
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:37,440
Why does he talk like that?
He reminds me of the guy.

288
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:38,274
Isn't there a character in like fast 
times at Ridgemont high played my 

289
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:42,510
matthew mcconnery mcconaughey.
Hey,

290
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,160
he's like a 30 year old that hangs 
around looking confused.

291
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,691
Yeah.
What,

292
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:47,760
what does,
what's that great line?

293
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,100
He,
he had to ride out,

294
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:51,200
ride out.
Oh,

295
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,060
there he is.
I had it ready to go.

296
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,290
He has a line.
He goes,

297
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,080
I get older,
but they stay the same age.

298
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,750
Something that's what he loves about 
high school girls was the line.

299
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,580
He pretty much,
is that correct?

300
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,840
Um,
you know,

301
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,750
hacking is actually in adult way of 
bullying.

302
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,400
What do you think about that?
I thought that was kind of interesting.

303
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,980
Hacking is actually an adult way of 
bullying.

304
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,350
Is this saint him saying he thinks he's 
been bullied,

305
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:15,184
right?
No,

306
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,560
we need to call a trump's life.
Where is coming from when that statement

307
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,490
really is a little bit but,

308
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,793
hmm.

309
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,460
Okay.
And when do you think,

310
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,410
I don't know.
I just thought it was funny thing.

311
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,490
He's being bullied.
Poor guy

312
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,240
and uh,
you know,

313
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,183
I don't know why the guy does it because
he doesn't get any real recognition for 

314
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,174
it.
He's not really messing up my life that 

315
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,550
bad cause my life.
I'm just not that important.

316
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,120
But um,
I've learned a lot from,

317
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,830
I learned about some ways to prevent 
hacking and all this stuff.

318
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,670
But Dude,
if you're out there,

319
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:56,130
I want you to reach out to me.
The guy still has my aol

320
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,520
sound like his password was like 
password.

321
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,013
I learned a lot about security.
Greg Paul rules still has his aol 

322
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:07,791
account.
Oh,

323
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,840
I missed that.
Wait,

324
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,793
I can't rewind it.

325
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,173
You back my aol account and Cooney or 
information here cause I want to hire 

326
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:15,700
you.

327
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Of course Craig Paul uses aol wants to 
hire the hacker throwing to jail.

328
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,330
I think this was probably an elaborate 
ruse to,

329
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,510
to get them,
this was his mastermind,

330
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,303
but you know Greg,
Paul probably still has aol dial up on 

331
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,440
autopay.
You know what I mean?

332
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,513
I read,
I read a stat that there's like a 

333
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,110
million people still paying all on a 
dial up.

334
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,960
Like all these old people that never 
upgrade their internet.

335
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,910
They're all like,
I bet you my grandparents,

336
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,900
he's like 94 still pays aol for 
dialogue.

337
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,593
We can use your smarts in and your skill
set in a positive way and probably make 

338
00:16:58,231 --> 00:17:00,820
you a shit ton of legit money.
Anyway,

339
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:02,320
a hope you guys have a great weekend.

340
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,780
Those were the two fingers.
I'm just telling you honestly.

341
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:10,614
He did this and boy,
I saw those fingers and a bucket of 

342
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,010
pissed.
You ready to come again?

343
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,170
Anyway,
I feel bad for him.

344
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,910
Hackings no fun.
It is adult bullying.

345
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:22,530
You're right.
I feel bad in a way.

346
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,410
I hope that girl was at her age.
All of those hackers.

347
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,850
She's such a nice male bullying.
Oh,

348
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:31,590
so now you agree.
I agree.

349
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:32,790
I came,
I came around.

350
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,250
It's adult bullying.
It's,

351
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,630
I don't know.
It's,

352
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,463
it sucks.
It's the worst thing you have to go 

353
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:40,080
through.
It is awful.

354
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,790
And it's like,

355
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,353
yeah,
it's awful.

356
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:49,670
Anyway,
my heart goes out to Greg Paul and um,

357
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,580
it gushes for him.
You might say my heart scotches from one

358
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:02,391
might say that and I really hope the 
girl was not under age for his sake.

359
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,280
For all of our sick,
for the world's sake,

360
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,593
please greg,
don't be fucking underage girls in 

361
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:12,870
recording it because like where the 
world is just not ready for that.

362
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,920
The Paul's aren't ready for that.
Youtube is not ready for that.

363
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,690
Greg,
please my heart gushes for you though.

364
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,880
You ready to come again?
All right.

365
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,860
All right,
so we can wrap it up from here.

366
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,800
Apparently the hacker said,
um,

367
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,283
what is the hacker said that they have 
way more amped up evidence that they've 

368
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:42,150
fought it to the FBI.
But yeah,

369
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,730
who knows what?
All of a sudden they have a conscious,

370
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,330
you know,
so there you go.

371
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,000
Um,
Greg,

372
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,470
I mean Greg is smashing though.
You came out here.

373
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:58,800
He's Jake's manager.
He's apparently yes.

374
00:18:58,801 --> 00:18:59,634
And it's Nick Crumpton left.
Greg is taken over the mantle and he is 

375
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:07,650
a mashing dude.
You need me to play that again?

376
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,440
Okay.
Uh,

377
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,800
moving on.
Post Malone is cursed.

378
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,663
You guys,
you may have heard the recent reports 

379
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:18,264
that,
first of all y'all heard about how his 

380
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:22,270
plane took off and the wheel blew up on 
takeoff.

381
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,530
They had to emergency land.
Thank God post Malone was okay.

382
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,783
Next up,
the next couple of days he's in a car 

383
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,320
crash or someone driving a quarter 
million dollar Rolls Royce,

384
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,670
a car crash thing.
God,

385
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,990
he's okay.
Got Blessed.

386
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:34,824
The suite are of that man and then an 
armed robbery took place at his old 

387
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:41,210
house.
That place we've been to I,

388
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,650
if it's the place I'm thinking of,
which I think it has to be,

389
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,570
we've been there a lot of times.

390
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,403
That's scary.
Armed robbers show up at the House 

391
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,200
asking more post Malone is terrifying 
and I'm so glad that post wasn't there.

392
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,584
He had since moved and the tenants that 
were living there got stood up at 

393
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,730
gunpoint.
They stall like 20,000

394
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,950
year.
There was some things,

395
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,050
jewelry.
So I'm,

396
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,943
I'm,
I'm so glad that Austin was in there 

397
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:11,550
because he's a kind of,
we don't call nine one,

398
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:13,860
one kinda guy.
You know what I mean?

399
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,240
That would have been some,
some gunfire.

400
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,480
I have a bad feeling.
But at any rate,

401
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,840
what is going on with Post Malone?
Well,

402
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,840
we think we have the answer guys.
We think we've figured it out.

403
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,710
And of course it's TMZ who was put the 
pieces together.

404
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,823
Um,
posting them messing with evil spirits 

405
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,240
on video now curse plane and car makes 
sense.

406
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,070
It all makes sense.
Finally,

407
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,920
this Guy Zach from ghost hunting.
These guys are so funny.

408
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,810
You know how I feel about goes something
postmodern loves it though.

409
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,840
So apparently,
um,

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,260
there's this,
uh,

411
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,810
Zach tells us the closing encounter went
down in June and is haunted museum.

412
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,030
The object is called the Dubuque Dbu 
box.

413
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,893
Dbu Is Yiddish for malicious spirit and 
the box inspired the horror flipped 

414
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:12,640
position,
really yiddish.

415
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,190
So they're saying that Jews are behind 
all of it.

416
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,310
Great.
It's another Jewish conspiracy.

417
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,330
So explain what is this?
So this box,

418
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:23,980
this Guy Zach,
the ghost hunter.

419
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,003
It's apparently the most cursed item in 
the world because they're Jewish ghosts 

420
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,420
and they got it.
They have a chip on their shoulder.

421
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,360
Yeah,
there's videos for this is it dude?

422
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,350
You got,
Oh fuck.

423
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:38,110
Let me fuck.
What the fuck dude you got?

424
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,840
That's kind of dope.
Think about that.

425
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,703
It's like,
um,

426
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,750
of all the cursed objects in the world,
you got Kirsty Gypsy shit,

427
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,000
cursed Polish Shit,
cursed whatever.

428
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:50,230
German shit.
Yeah,

429
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,690
it's the Yiddish ghost.
They're the most gnarly.

430
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,093
The Jewish goes.
So the ones you absolutely do not want 

431
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,300
to fuck with.
That's kind of it up.

432
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,560
So here's the video that explains 
everything that's been going on.

433
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,190
I want you guys to,
that's a,

434
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,373
at his house or something.
It's that it's haunted museum and I 

435
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:09,514
think Vegas,
so this is the first time he's actually 

436
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,383
apparently taken the box off or touch 
the case itself as the story as opposed 

437
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:18,670
to,
and is freaking out.

438
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,510
And he's like,
don't do it.

439
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,370
But that's where postmen fucked up.
You see?

440
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,670
See Zach,
the ghost hunter knows what he's doing.

441
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:27,340
He knows how to handle a curse.
He talks to the box,

442
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:29,850
the first one ever to do it.
Awesome alone.

443
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,693
Being the sweet guy.
He tried to break them away from the 

444
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:35,020
box,
but curse was transferred to them.

445
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:35,854
In that moment.
The lights are off obviously for s add 

446
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,070
spooky effect.
Did like,

447
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,933
you know,
we could have the lights on but let's 

448
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:49,690
leave him off.
Um,

449
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,213
this is the curse.
Djourou what's with the star of Davids 

450
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:56,050
and like,
you've got like a Torah and shit.

451
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,330
What is this?
Some kind of fucking Jewish fun house.

452
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,080
Yeah,

453
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,150
Austin's freak the fuck out.
He's trying to get out.

454
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,110
Oh,
he turned on the lights.

455
00:23:04,111 --> 00:23:06,480
Thank God Austin.
Oh wait man.

456
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,100
Yeah.
He just turned on the light here.

457
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:09,060
You can see,
I'll go back.

458
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,590
He goes back to the door.
He's like,

459
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:15,150
fuck this turns on the lights.
Zach is trying to play it cool.

460
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:17,040
Like he doesn't care.
Um,

461
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,490
but here he goes in Austin's like,
dude,

462
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,100
this is a,
this isn't just any ghosts.

463
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,110
This is a Yiddish goes cause also knows 
better.

464
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,001
You know,
we went,

465
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:29,970
when we went go something with Austin,
he was very respectful.

466
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:32,430
He was very cautious about the spirits.
He really,

467
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,670
he believes this stuff and he was not 
fucking around,

468
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:38,610
so I know that he's,
he's deadly serious about this stuff.

469
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,220
No,
there was the thing where when he,

470
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,353
when he opens the door,
I think there's like something moving 

471
00:23:44,431 --> 00:23:47,240
out of the lefty.
We'll play by play,

472
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:49,520
but first let's hone in on that.
But first,

473
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:52,760
let's see what happens.
So often it's freaking out.

474
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,663
He's got a beer in hand.
He's trying to talk Zach and to getting 

475
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:56,510
out.
He's hyper ventilate,

476
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:58,250
he's breathing heavy.
He's grabbing him.

477
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,020
He's saying they run out of the room now

478
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,373
post malone being the sweet guy he was,
he took the curse from Zack and these 

479
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:13,800
old yiddish.
She goes,

480
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,500
you know what I need to do?
I think I can resolve this.

481
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,750
What,
because these yiddish ghosts,

482
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:21,840
they need a good Jewish boy to come talk
sense into them.

483
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,170
I think I can channel maybe these 
yiddish ghosts and lift the curtain.

484
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,490
Curse the curse.
No,

485
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,190
no,
no.

486
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,280
I am a good Jewish boy.
I'm well fed.

487
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,410
That is all yiddish grandmother ever 
wanted.

488
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,903
I'm a good sweet bar Mitzvah and I think
that I can talk some sense into these 

489
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,460
shooters goes,
should I say a prayer?

490
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,553
No,
I think I should say a prayer to lift 

491
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:47,960
the curse.
Uh,

492
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,310
can you pipe me in some,
a prayer,

493
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:51,960
a prayer.
Spooky.

494
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:52,800
Yiddish prayer.
Music.

495
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,230
Should I have that?
Um,

496
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,500
this is maybe appropriate.
No,

497
00:24:58,501 --> 00:24:59,400
no,
this is too sad,

498
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:01,960
isn't it?
Um,

499
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,840
angelic music.
There's no,

500
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,760
there's angels in Judaism,
right?

501
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,720
No,
no,

502
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,553
no,
no,

503
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,630
no.
For Christ Sake,

504
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,580
curse on you.
Get curse on you,

505
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,600
right.
Uh,

506
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:15,270
yiddish spirits.
What was it?

507
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:19,240
What were they called?
They were called the [inaudible].

508
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,680
They did book the Debug,
debug spirits.

509
00:25:22,681 --> 00:25:26,070
Cursing Post Malone.
He's a good boy.

510
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,150
He's a good sweet boy.
He loves his parents.

511
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,670
And is this the prayer?
Yeah,

512
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:36,060
it is not fair.
This is my prayer.

513
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,140
I'm trying to banish the,
trying to banish the Yiddish goes.

514
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:46,010
He eats well and I've cooked lockers 
with aunt for him on several occasions.

515
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,040
We spend tradle on Hanukkah together.

516
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,960
Me and Austin have spun tradle and you 
are going to curse this good Jewish boy.

517
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,340
How dare you.
Austin comes from a good family and was,

518
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,123
and also he loves Hala Bread.
I know that because I've shared Hala 

519
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:11,524
bread with him.
If you can lift this curse yiddish 

520
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:15,370
spirits,
Dave Lik,

521
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,523
what is it?
[inaudible] book the Book and return to 

522
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:20,814
your box.

523
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,420
Then this Jewish boy will be forever 
grateful that I'm a bar Mitzvah.

524
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:27,191
Amen.
As this.

525
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:29,600
So I need this adventure of like,
eh,

526
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:35,540
their book boxes on Ebay and really,
and they all look so weird.

527
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,890
It does it.
One,

528
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,610
he lives on the fucking search for some 
d book.

529
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,260
Get some Debo Cup in here.
Let's order one here.

530
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,760
All we can buy the shit on it.
Well,

531
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:49,710
what's so special we can buy the shit on
Ebay.

532
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,150
Kid made haunted debug book box,
20 bucks.

533
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:54,984
Real shit alone.
I feel like I'm getting curse just 

534
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:02,550
looking at it.
That is going on with heart wrenching.

535
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,313
Um,
Shit.

536
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,870
Um,
there is a more in debt related items.

537
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:12,510
Like what is this?
Can you play,

538
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,393
play any music playing any music?
Cause I seriously want to get rid of 

539
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:15,760
this curse.

540
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,760
I care a lot about post malone.
If God's d book goes out there,

541
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,163
lift the curse on postage alone,
I will make him eat a hundred bowls of 

542
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:28,774
Matzah ball soup.
I swear to you now on the body of Moses 

543
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:36,870
and the burning Bush itself.

544
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,283
Okay?

545
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:43,530
I will spread any scene of [inaudible] 
to fish if you will.

546
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:50,110
Just lift the curse on the sweet young 
post Malone.

547
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,910
He doesn't deserve it.
He looked back me up.

548
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,220
Yes.
Amen.

549
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,910
Amen.
We will spin draco.

550
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,043
We will eco filter fish.
We will share in the good times of 

551
00:28:01,691 --> 00:28:03,090
Matzah ball soup.
He's a sweet kid.

552
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,640
He doesn't deserve this.
You're an old Jewish lady.

553
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:13,780
You got a chip on your shoulder.
Get some therapy and the afterlife.

554
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,340
There's somebody out there that can help
you.

555
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,713
For Christ's sake.
Don't take your disappointment and your 

556
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:20,330
grandchildren out on

557
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,483
Milan.

558
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,550
All Jewish grand parents are 
disappointed in their grandchildren.

559
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:29,630
That's light.
Be at Peace Day book,

560
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:36,380
be at peace.
Beautiful,

561
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,970
calm first would appreciate that I 
really powerful stuff.

562
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:41,740
Do it.
I think I left the curse.

563
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:43,270
I felt there was a change in the,
uh,

564
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,670
felt that there was a change the spirit.
Meanwhile,

565
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,770
I dunno.
I felt like maybe Austin Prob,

566
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:55,950
I think he owes me.
Um,

567
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,623
can we show them,
and I notice this very spooky moment 

568
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,120
here.
I read it in the comments,

569
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:07,770
but soap go ahead of you.
And when he opens the door,

570
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,813
was it there off the top right to the 
point where he opens the door at the 

571
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,420
top.
There it goes.

572
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,470
There's something that flies out of the 
room side right here where my mouse is.

573
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,690
It flies all the way from here out the 
door.

574
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,010
Yeah.
Watch this.

575
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,680
When he opens the door,
you see that?

576
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,360
Did you see that?
I see,

577
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,450
I see.
I'm telling you.

578
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,850
Gook fest,
2000 and fucking 18.

579
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,910
Hey right here.
One more time.

580
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,660
Watch it comes from the left side of 
screen out the door.

581
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,160
There it goes.
A white light.

582
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,880
Now,
a reasonable explanation.

583
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,503
Bhag bug.
It could be the reflection on that door 

584
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:50,020
reflecting off the camera or something 
like that.

585
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:50,854
You know what I mean?
But most likely it's a d book that came 

586
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:55,750
in and infected the whole fucking 
planet.

587
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:02,400
So I need to say another blessing.
Everyone's like,

588
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,323
fuck no.

589
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,363
All right.

590
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,000
Well anyway,
my first thought was like,

591
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:10,890
seriously,
the Jews are behind this.

592
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,470
Yeah.
Blame the Jews.

593
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,960
Typical.
I can believe this items.

594
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,850
We just found it on Ebay.
All right,

595
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,860
well up next we've got the Nadoo weather
reporters.

596
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,970
All their coverage of this hurricane was
outlandish in insane and hilarious,

597
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,223
so stay tuned.
We will be right back after this short 

598
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,200
words from our sponsors through my 
mouth.

599
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,990
Stitch fix has reimagined the way we 
find and buy clothing.

600
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:46,750
Here's what stitch fix is.
You go to their website,

601
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,990
you fill out a questionnaire.
You tell him what's your budget?

602
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,370
What kind of guy are you an a stylist 
springs into actual,

603
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,810
your virtual mom or girlfriend does a 
little shopping for you and sends it to,

604
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,660
okay.
Now that's convenient enough as it is,

605
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:03,790
but here's the thing,
if you don't like it,

606
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,860
you don't keep it.
If it doesn't fit,

607
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,630
you don't keep it.
You send it back.

608
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,350
Boom.

609
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,080
It's so convenient.
That's it.

610
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,610
You know?
Uh,

611
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,210
some guys can't dress and let's face it.
One of those guys is Dan,

612
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,010
our producer.
He's a sweet guy,

613
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:20,470
but he started using stitch fix.
Unlike me,

614
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,080
I'm Mr Swab.
I always dress great psych.

615
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,120
That's isla the dress.
Dan.

616
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:27,070
On the other hand,
I always dress like an idiot.

617
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:28,420
What am I even saying?
Dan,

618
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:30,280
on the other hand,
love stitch fix.

619
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,100
He uses it all the time and he can't put
this hoodie down,

620
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,053
Dan,
to tell him about how much you love 

621
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,540
stitch fix.
It's just unbelievable.

622
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:41,170
It's changed my whole life since.
A little irony there,

623
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:43,690
Dan,
but I know that you're not being ironic.

624
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:46,300
You're being genuine because it was a 
great service that I recommend everybody

625
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:47,134
try.
This stylist fee is only $20 which is 

626
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:51,160
applied as a credit towards anything you
keep.

627
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,400
So guys,
hurry to stitch fix.com/

628
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,253
[inaudible] and get started right 
freaking now because if you keep all 

629
00:31:57,851 --> 00:32:01,240
five items in your box,
you get 25% off your purchase.

630
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,240
Go to stitch fix dotcom slash h three 
rings.

631
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:11,240
Mission is to make neighborhoods safer.
I love ring.

632
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,133
I've been using this product for years 
and for me it's changing the way that 

633
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,770
home security works.
You've got to ring what it,

634
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,280
first of all,
it started with the doorbell.

635
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,293
You clicked the doorbell,
it makes the noise inside of like a 

636
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:24,500
normal Doba but it's also got a camera 
and a microphone.

637
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,070
So if somebody's been creeping on your 
doors,

638
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:29,750
stealing a package,
whatever it be asked Shenanigans,

639
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:30,584
they're up to.
Not only does it record them based on 

640
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:33,134
motion,
but it zaps the recording up to the 

641
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:36,434
cloud and saves it forever.
That means that they're not getting 

642
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:41,600
away.
I mean you can talk to them.

643
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,640
You can tell him,
hey buddy,

644
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,753
why f exactly you?
Oh now we're talking home security now 

645
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:49,850
here,
let me tell you about,

646
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,030
they've got rink flood lights,
these things are awesome.

647
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,710
I got them sold in our house.
It's so great.

648
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,663
It's a flood light and motion detector 
and a video camera offers the same 

649
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:00,230
thing.
You could bless them with a siren too.

650
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,513
It's incredible.
And they've got this thing on the app 

651
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:03,734
called neighbors and like all your 
neighbors within like a two or three 

652
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:09,050
mile radius upload videos of shenanigans
going on at their house.

653
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,240
It's like a little community and it's so
great.

654
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:12,074
Like there's these old ladies that post 
videos of like delivery guys that are 

655
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:15,860
going to the wrong door.
They're like,

656
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,843
this guy was ringing at my door at 8:00
PM does anyone know who him and 

657
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,740
everyone's clowning on?
The old lady like it's a delivery.

658
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,900
It's a delivery.
Like really?

659
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,000
Is this what this apps come through?
It's Hilarious,

660
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:26,834
but there's some good stuff there too,
but it's a lot of entertainment and 

661
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:31,400
besides the entertainment,
it's great security guys.

662
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,610
They cannot endorse this product enough.

It's easy as that.

674

680
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,480

They'll tell you straight up,
no bs,

682

one to 10.

683
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:35,720
green is good,
red is bad.

684
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,190
I mean it's basically you see the view 
from the seat.

685
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,900
Boom.
There's no surprises.

686
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,700

reliable place to get tickets upfront.

730
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:04,550
Welcome back.
Nutty weather reporters.

731
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,800
This has been a phenomenon that's been 
going on.

732
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,910
Um,
these reporters,

733
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:12,744
they send them out and to hurricanes and
treacherous weather crap out crack open 

734
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:22,821
here is 30 pounds and they make these 
poor sons of bitches basically brave,

735
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,713
dangerous wins.
And sometimes the ones they're not that 

736
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:32,400
dangerous so they have to hype up the 
danger themselves.

737
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,860
We've got a little of each got a little 
off but what was the name of this recent

738
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:38,970
hurricane?
Florence.

739
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,930
That's right.
So uh,

740
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:45,700
you guys may have heard there was one 
particular gentlemen,

741
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,133
um,
that was called out all over the 

742
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:53,391
Internet for his uh,
Hurricane Florence meme and this guy was

743
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:59,361
out in the weather channel and it's kind
of this classic story of acting like the

744
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:00,414
weather's insane.
And then somebody walking through the 

745
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:04,470
back wall here.
I'll let you watch.

746
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,900
All right.
Now,

747
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:13,734
first of all,
worth noting is I'm leaning in North 

748
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,920
Carolina right away from the where the 
wind is blowing.

749
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,103
Like that doesn't make any sense.
People have said that maybe he's 

750
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:31,200
covering the microphone,
but that doesn't really make sense to me

751
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,443
cause you can see as it goes on,
he's clearly not covering the 

752
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,110
microphone,
just whipping through here.

753
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,120
More heavy rain.
Well they have that.

754
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,840
Woo.
He's trying to brace some stuff though.

755
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,370
That is a pretty healthy cusp right 
there.

756
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:44,204
When you have fun anyway,
here in the beginning you can see a 

757
00:38:46,221 --> 00:38:49,610
couple of dudes just strolling as casual
as possible.

758
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,113
Okay.

759
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,590
And Wilmington,
North Carolina,

760
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:57,500
right at the intracoastal.
And we're in one of these bands.

761
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,403
This is just literally scrolling by and 
Patchouli as possibly do I love 

762
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:10,540
sneakers.
There's truly no problem balancing.

763
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,390
We're 60 miles an hour.
Yeah.

764
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,183
So there you go.
Who would I thought that only on 

765
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:19,204
Youtube.
I thought people exaggerate and right 

766
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,973
quick money.
And these are like real professional 

767
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:28,720
weathermen is it like scientists?
That's what I'm saying.

768
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:29,554
You set up these atmospheres and 
everybody will be reduced to a 

769
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:38,190
clickbaiting Nice Smr,
spaghetti con of Jesus Christ.

770
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:45,400
I click on it starts again.
So anyway,

771
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,700
people got really upset by this,
um,

772
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,860
overdramatizing of how bad it is.
I find it just funny.

773
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:54,694
It's like,
damn,

774
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,270
you're out there bracing yourself the 
wrong way.

775
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,043
And um,

776
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,010
anyway,
the other excuse I heard,

777
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,380
is there anything to this that it's that
Oh,

778
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:07,430
well he was,
um,

779
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,590
he was standing on grass is why.
Yeah,

780
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:10,910
I've got that from the,
I'll,

781
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,710
I'll read that later.
That man,

782
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,810
while I have a statement from the 
weather report,

783
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:18,080
they defend him against the claims and 
I,

784
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,400
I'm,
I've got it all laid out.

785
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,343
I want to enjoy some more footage of 
this guy bracing against the 

786
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:25,600
treacherous,
whether raw cane and we're getting gusts

787
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,523
pushing God still.
So it goes without saying the 

788
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:32,374
categories.
Sometimes we're misleading with 

789
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:36,910
hurricanes where the wind is whipping 
through here.

790
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:39,250
More heavy guys,
40 miles per hour.

791
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,410
Hold on there by hold on there that you 
have to lower your center.

792
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,570
Hold on there by like on top Bronco or 
some shit.

793
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,480
Anyway,
so we've got a whole thing here.

794
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,403
Let's see what we got.

795
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,880
So this guy got into a bunch of,
of,

796
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:55,714
uh,
stuff and weather channel made a 

797
00:40:57,961 --> 00:41:00,360
statement.
They're supporting their boy.

798
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:01,770
They're not leaving them out in the 
trenches.

799
00:41:01,771 --> 00:41:02,820
They said,
yeah.

800
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,040
And they got his back.
You know,

801
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,030
whether people,
the weather people,

802
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:07,470
they,
they're a tight knit community.

803
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,533
They said it's important to note that 
the two individuals in the background 

804
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:16,650
are walking on concrete.
And Mike said l they name him.

805
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,170
They name him and shame him first and 
last name.

806
00:41:19,171 --> 00:41:20,004
And Mike settle is trying to maintain 
his footing on what grass after 

807
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:24,174
reporting on air until 1:00
AM this morning and his undoubtably 

808
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:28,050
exhausted.
Well,

809
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,110
I mean Mike counter is just stand on the
concrete.

810
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:36,770
How has done the on grass changes?
Anything I haven't noticed.

811
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:42,020
It doesn't on growth.
It doesn't really that much.

812
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:42,960
They those,
yeah.

813
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:45,500
I don't know.
It doesn't really.

814
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,390
Um,
but the weather,

815
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,150
the weather channel,
they love this hurricane shit.

816
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,770
They go crazy this day.
They blew their entire production budget

817
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,203
for the whole year.
They put together these insane three d 

818
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:03,851
renders where these reporters stand and 
like a severe with a massive crazy green

819
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:10,540
screen and they show you virtually like 
where are the water heights are,

820
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,473
will be.
And it's just so over the fucking top 

821
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:16,400
for what I,
it's amazing.

822
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,234
It's really cool.
But they're all just so jacked about 

823
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:20,594
these hurt hurricanes.
And here let me show you born to bring 

824
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:25,380
kind of crack.
It's kind of crap.

825
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,153
Look at this shit.
That certainly is enough to knock you 

826
00:42:29,201 --> 00:42:30,034
off.
Beat.

827
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,423
Definitely stole cars out.
Even carry cars away as certainly flood 

828
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:36,554
many of the lower levels of structures,
but we know Florence is also going to 

829
00:42:38,691 --> 00:42:42,590
bring water.
It's water.

830
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:43,400
Yeah,
no,

831
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,960
six feet of water.
Imagine that.

832
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,080
Imagine the add on,
for example,

833
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,733
the technology of the weatherman that 
would otherwise be and also tommy cause 

834
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,470
higher and where else can we use this 
technology?

835
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,660
Oh,
it goes even higher.

836
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,140
I go,
you said it perfectly reminds me of like

837
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,320
the facebook,
the ducker cruise through Puerto Rico,

838
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,200
the Puerto Rico life's trainer,
fish in the water.

839
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:15,470
Why the fuck is that realistic?
Cover up one story.

840
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:17,220
Buildings and structures and the 
details.

841
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,550
Mather,
anything that's certainly pose a risk to

842
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:22,750
many.
There are very few places so he wouldn't

843
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,100
be that.
Now that is like,

844
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:26,730
man,
he's underwater.

845
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,750
They didn't even tell his ass.

846
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,300
It's a wall.
That wall.

847
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,353
Follow the advice of your local 
officials and he viewed that black 

848
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,224
thing.
It's the garbage bag corpse and I bet 

849
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,070
that's selling.
You know,

850
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:45,903
the intention is good.
Heed the advice and get the hell out of 

851
00:43:47,951 --> 00:43:49,660
there.
Don't get washed away.

852
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,090
Okay.

853
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,280
Don't braved the storm.
You know,

854
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:54,370
it's funny,
I find ironic.

855
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,730
All of these weather reporters are like,
do not braved the storm.

856
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,470
Everybody evacuated and meanwhile I'm 
going to do right.

857
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,304
No one's blown away and listened to me.
They tried to justify staying because 

858
00:44:07,451 --> 00:44:08,284
it's so stupid.
By over reacting and acting like till 

859
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,000
like shit,
nothing's happening.

860
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:18,270
There's another clip of a girl I love.
I love these clubs.

861
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:19,740
It's just,
it's incredible.

862
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,380
Loved their enthusiasm for hurricanes.

863
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,670
Florence is a large and extremely 
destructive hurricane.

864
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:26,563
Storm surge is going to be potentially 
life threatening for some areas along 

865
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:30,584
the u s coastline and this morning we've
seen the water picking up over some of 

866
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:34,584
the roadways.
Let's go ahead and take a look at what 

867
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:36,654
could be a reasonable worst case 
scenario for areas along North Carolina 

868
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,300
all the way here from surf city to North
Topsail beach,

869
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:43,134
we could be talking about up to six feet
of storm surge and again impacts have 

870
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:49,740
already begun today with the storm 
approaching even inland.

871
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:51,600
It's not just going to be a coastal 
event here,

872
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:52,434
areas along the river and that we can 
show you what this could look like if 

873
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:57,990
you were to find yourself in this 
scenario.

874
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:01,710
Once that water comes in three feet,
you can see it on my shins,

875
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,053
my waist.
This could be enough to knock you off 

876
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:05,514
your feet.
You can eat another guy at the far side 

877
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:09,024
of the roadway.
This is extremely dangerous to that six 

878
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:15,330
foot range.
How high this water goes.

879
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,860
Ooh.
Wins pick everything.

880
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:18,743
Yeah,
they did.

881
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,720
They got a little choreography with it 
yet no powers

882
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,673
stand here.
Even withstand the force of the water 

883
00:45:24,781 --> 00:45:25,790
coming in.
No Shit.

884
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,970
But anyway,

885
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,540
I thought that was great.
I love that.

886
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,660
Love it very much.
And then of course there was,

887
00:45:34,661 --> 00:45:36,370
of all things,
like you said,

888
00:45:36,371 --> 00:45:37,204
they probably blew up all their budget.
They have a production budget that they 

889
00:45:40,331 --> 00:45:41,164
blow one week,
the next toy there point is going to be 

890
00:45:44,351 --> 00:45:46,930
on like the cell phone camera.
Yeah,

891
00:45:46,931 --> 00:45:48,130
exactly.
They don't,

892
00:45:48,131 --> 00:45:51,820
they can't afford cameraman anymore.
Then of course there was,

893
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:55,060
um,
ludy interestingly,

894
00:45:55,061 --> 00:45:59,020
of all places,
a dollar store was alluded.

895
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:03,003
If you're gonna I mean a dollar store 
looters [inaudible] dollar store 

896
00:46:09,671 --> 00:46:11,530
looters,
that's gotta be,

897
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,480
I mean,
that's rock bottom money shit.

898
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:14,323
Dot loot somewhere else.
At least if you're going to break the 

899
00:46:16,181 --> 00:46:17,014
law,
could something more valuable than a 

900
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,880
neiman marcus or something?
Come on.

901
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,200
Yeah,
no.

902
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,210
Anyway,
let's watch a video.

903
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:30,230
This reporter is 13th and very brave.
What are you getting there?

904
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,240
Entering the cup,
right?

905
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:34,210
Kitchen towels.
A couple of kitchen towels,

906
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:35,060
some juice,
some,

907
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,060
some cheap oil.

908
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,170
That's useful.
Uh,

909
00:46:41,171 --> 00:46:42,250
you know,
you could get there.

910
00:46:42,251 --> 00:46:46,720
You could steal a 10 pack of sporks.
What does park?

911
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,613
It's a,
it's a fork spoon combination into one 

912
00:46:49,691 --> 00:46:50,830
utensil.
Oh,

913
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,090
there's some fancy sporks actually have 
a knife on the side that's outside of,

914
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,590
that's the two.
That's,

915
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,440
you can't find that kind of quality at 
the dollar store though.

916
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:01,923
Um,
is anyone else that sat at the dollar 

917
00:47:06,461 --> 00:47:09,910
store and not everything costs a dollar?
Shouldn't even be,

918
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:15,180
I think because you know it doesn't 
upset me because I know that you,

919
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:17,643
I would go shopping in those stores and 
then it's what I want is like 15 $15 

920
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,800
that no,
that's too far.

921
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:24,923
Yeah.
If you have a $15 item in the dollar 

922
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:29,750
store close up.
I'm alluding is what I'm at.

923
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,510
I'm alluding your dollar store.
I understand in this day and age is 2018

924
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:37,660
we've had a flesh and if you,
you can kick it up to two or three bucks

925
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:38,494
for a really premium,
I'm talking about a spork with a knife 

926
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:41,314
up the side.

927
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,660
You can charge a premium for that.
No,

928
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:44,494
I remember even in Israel we have both 
stores and it's like a shotgun store 

929
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:49,983
that's 25 cents by the way.
But then what I want would be 20 

930
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:55,870
shaking.
Oh give me a fucking break.

931
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:57,950
Yeah you make a scene.
Do,

932
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,893
do row stuff.
Do you yell and you know I just only by 

933
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:06,280
the the shaking and stuff.
Okay.

934
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,740
What do you buy for a shekel?
That's the only 25 cents.

935
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:09,663
I used to love buying stickers there 
cause they would have like really weird 

936
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:17,820
Chinese knockoff stickers when like how 
much money we're looking.

937
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,040
Well that's what these people are 
stealing cars.

938
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:24,430
This is a dollar store.
So it's fun and interesting.

939
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,380
I catch hell if I feel bad because it's 
like pure desperation.

940
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:30,303
They might need food.
I mean how desperate are you if you're 

941
00:48:32,381 --> 00:48:34,390
stealing shit from a dollar store,
I don't know.

942
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,310
Go for it.
I say really?

943
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:39,190
You say loot the dollar store.
That's still illegal activity.

944
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,280
I feel bad.
I feel bad for emergency.

945
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:45,580
Someone owns that store out.
It's kind of drizzling.

946
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:47,530
Dan.
I'm not going to say that this is a life

947
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:49,900
or death situation,
particularly quip.

948
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:51,730
It's a little bit,
but you never know.

949
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:53,500
But I'm saying like if you're,
if you're,

950
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,490
if you're alluding a dollar store,
you're not like,

951
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:59,590
you know,
set for life.

952
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,610
I mean you might be able to enjoy those 
stickers.

953
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,790
If you own a dollar store,
you're not set for life.

954
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,450
Depends is it a chain is a mom and pop's
dollar stores have dollar tree.

955
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:14,880
Dollar tree can get looted the fuck out 
of it.

956
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:15,490
Yeah,
that's fine.

957
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:16,250
Yeah.
Damn.

958
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,083
And when did,
when did you become such a vigilante 

959
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,230
Jesus Christ?
Amen.

960
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:21,610
When it's an emergency.

961
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,563
I know I did not.
I just remember we never did a 

962
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:31,300
background check on dance dance like a 
police murder.

963
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:33,543
Anyway,
wash the bravery of this lady and she 

964
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:35,584
confronts these awful dollar store 
criminals in the wake of this awful 

965
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:41,080
tragedy.
It's a national emergency.

966
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,030
I want to identify what they're 
stealing.

967
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:50,080
So this guy's got a 12 pack of coke,
zero by the way.

968
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,120
Excellent taste young man.
That's actually,

969
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:55,954
those are mini cans.
It looks like maybe a six pack of mini 

970
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,000
in the dollar store.
Ralph's.

971
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,853
Those run about three bucks.
So $3 but if it's a six pack of mini 

972
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:08,764
cans,
you might be able to get those for a 

973
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:11,470
buck.
They're probably expired,

974
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,610
obviously.
Excuse me.

975
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:18,190
Do you know that you're stealing a six 
packs of coke?

976
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:19,840
Zero.
Excuse me.

977
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,813
What does she think?
You're caught committing an act of 

978
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:24,994
crime.
You're supposed to stop and do a little 

979
00:50:26,351 --> 00:50:27,980
interview.
You know what I mean?

980
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,690
Can we see your face please,
sir?

981
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:32,030
And uh,
your name and phone number and address.

982
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,680
I'm really curious about both feeling or
you know,

983
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,520
your lips.

984
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,271
Wait,
the kid playing.

985
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:40,700
I went,
oh,

986
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,533
I'm just try.
I really want to identify what they've 

987
00:50:42,701 --> 00:50:43,820
gotten.
The car correct.

988
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:47,680
He's got what looks like a tub with like
maybe some detergent.

989
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,083
Well,
tupperware.

990
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:50,720
I mean,
look,

991
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,240
if you're willing to steal detergent.

992
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:54,780
Yeah.

993
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,613
Well anyway,
Chris Stealing is stealing folks on 

994
00:50:57,031 --> 00:50:57,864
that,
right?

995
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,763
Just say it.

996
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,040
You know that you're alluding and

997
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:07,160
the law in and compromise everything I 
stand for as a human being to get a free

998
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:08,870
six pack of coke.
Zero expired.

999
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:09,823
Yes.

1000
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:14,600
You can see people coming out apple 
juice with items left and right from the

1001
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:17,490
store.
It's like when you're in class and new

1002
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:21,020
kids are cheating on the exam.
She's like the kid that's like,

1003
00:51:21,021 --> 00:51:22,550
I see you guys.
She's a nurse.

1004
00:51:22,551 --> 00:51:24,670
She's a fucking snitch is what you mean?
Yeah.

1005
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,010
I see.
Nobody wanted,

1006
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:28,844
they like candles.
There's a full shelf of like candles or 

1007
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:32,060
like something on the,

1008
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,500
we'll get this star.
Yeah,

1009
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:43,190
that's like trash.
He's so concerned.

1010
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,730
I can go back around front guys.
Right?

1011
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,080
I mean,
there are no books.

1012
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,100
She's truly brave law enforcement 
onsite.

1013
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,500
Oh Shit.
No law enforcement.

1014
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:55,880
Excuse me sir.
Um,

1015
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:57,520
what are you going to be doing with 
that?

1016
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,780
A small can of tomato paste talking to 
me.

1017
00:52:01,781 --> 00:52:03,530
All right,
look across the street here.

1018
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:07,550
People are filling up what looks like 
laundry bags full of items.

1019
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:10,010
Wow.
Running.

1020
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:13,130
It's a mass mixer here.
And let's go back to the front crystal.

1021
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,910
Excuse me sir.
What are you trash bags.

1022
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,560
You are stealing a,
what are those toy guns with like little

1023
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:22,394
car.
Anyway,

1024
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:23,763
this is a,
this is what's the worst of the worst 

1025
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:28,840
than these hurricanes folks.
People

1026
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,283
expensive.
This is the worst of the worst at this 

1027
00:52:34,661 --> 00:52:36,290
is as bad as it gets.
Huh?

1028
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:36,931
Thanks.
Think I,

1029
00:52:36,931 --> 00:52:41,931
they ain't losing your house.
There's people that some for kids taking

1030
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:45,190
like a six pack of paper.
They just on the ground.

1031
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,180
This is as bad as it gets walks.
Meanwhile,

1032
00:52:49,181 --> 00:52:51,850
people are fucking dead.
Their houses floating down anyway,

1033
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:53,170
it's all funny.
It's all funny.

1034
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,830
I'm not saying Ludy not defending allude
in,

1035
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,370
uh,
at the situations.

1036
00:52:57,371 --> 00:53:00,040
Hilarious.
They're alluding a dollar store.

1037
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:00,874
You got this reporter that thinks she's 
like on the ground in Vietnam or 

1038
00:53:04,211 --> 00:53:06,430
something.
You know what I mean?

1039
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,860
Did the worst and these hurricanes 
folks,

1040
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,103
uh,
people getting desperate looking for 

1041
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:15,730
items looks like they've just busted 
completely through the door here.

1042
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:17,980
I would watch,
I could watch,

1043
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:19,180
I swear to God can wash worship,
I don't know,

1044
00:53:19,181 --> 00:53:21,680
30 minutes.
I love that clip.

1045
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,880
Cool.
Wonderful stuff.

1046
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,700
Really great stuff.
Um,

1047
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:31,640
what else we got?
Uh,

1048
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,420
manner of time.
Oh yeah.

1049
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:37,250
So here's another bozo out and the storm
from the hurricane.

1050
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,570
Now this guy,

1051
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,260
yeah,

1052
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,093
on the opposite end you've got do it 
pretending to be in danger and then 

1053
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:44,964
you've got dude,
cause you send these reporters out when 

1054
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,220
sometimes it is actually dangerous and 
this is one of those times

1055
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:53,440
what is like fill it back to you.
10 before we let you go.

1056
00:53:53,441 --> 00:53:54,274
Some of these

1057
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,820
tad,
before we let you go,

1058
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,190
we want to make sure that you die

1059
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,830
some of these different live shots.
Okay.

1060
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,013
We've seen,
we've seen people wandering around a 

1061
00:54:05,831 --> 00:54:06,664
little bit.
Are those reporters outcome rate or or 

1062
00:54:08,681 --> 00:54:09,514
are you seeing residents in the area 
just kind of coming out and taking a 

1063
00:54:12,761 --> 00:54:16,120
look at things?
This morning I,

1064
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,970
I've seen a couple reporters out driving
around,

1065
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,760
but as we,
as we turn around now,

1066
00:54:21,761 --> 00:54:22,594
there aren't many that we can see.
They're starting to be a couple of the 

1067
00:54:25,421 --> 00:54:27,980
people who have stuck around that 
gentlemen down there.

1068
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:32,981
And a yellow raincoat is a local land by
huge,

1069
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,400
uh,
sheet metal is a little shock.

1070
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,500
We're okay.
That was just not cut a little spoon.

1071
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,270
You're going to be surprised and I think
he's ready to get out of there.

1072
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,310
Yeah.
Oh,

1073
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:49,600
it's good to go.
I don't know about this.

1074
00:54:49,601 --> 00:54:51,120
Go and I'm gonna let you guys go,

1075
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,050
ted,
before you go,

1076
00:54:54,051 --> 00:54:54,884
uh,
can you tell us how did that feel 

1077
00:54:55,941 --> 00:54:56,774
getting hit by a sheet metal?
Do you see any other debris flying 

1078
00:54:59,481 --> 00:55:03,170
around?
He pulled that on him a tad before you'd

1079
00:55:03,171 --> 00:55:04,004
go.
You're not getting paid extra hour 

1080
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,520
regular.
Right.

1081
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,583
I'm going to head out of here.
I'm going to let you guys go a Ted 

1082
00:55:11,481 --> 00:55:15,080
before you go.
Can you tell me?

1083
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:18,560
Do you see corpses around?
Do you see any other flying debris?

1084
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:21,753
By the way?
The one thing that's always common in 

1085
00:55:23,021 --> 00:55:23,854
these reporters out on the field,
they're getting blown away and acting 

1086
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:30,250
like the world's in chaos.
The camera man is standing there holding

1087
00:55:30,251 --> 00:55:32,680
the super heavy thing.
He never fucking budges,

1088
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,010
you know that's true.

1089
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:38,403
Okay.

1090
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,800
Or you go,
not all heroes wear report her outfits.

1091
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,640
Right.
Well Sadiola I give that as a word at us

1092
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,800
were before you'd go ted,
can you uh,

1093
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,570
go near any glass windows that are left 
it up?

1094
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,540
Bust out.
All right,

1095
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:06,450
ted.
Oh,

1096
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,480
looks like Ted got hit by a sheet metal 
before you go ted.

1097
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,830
Anyway,
good stuff.

1098
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:16,664
Huh?

1099
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:21,100
Do we have quality content here or what?
Um,

1100
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:25,690
and then of course you've got some 
classic ones that I wanted to share with

1101
00:56:25,691 --> 00:56:26,860
you guys.
You may have seen it,

1102
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:29,170
but these are my favorite ones as well.
I mean,

1103
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:30,004
this guy got in trouble,
but I feel like these guys kind of 

1104
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:33,880
goofed up even worse because,
well,

1105
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,290
I'll,
I'll this,

1106
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,550
he's in a canoe.
Okay.

1107
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:40,790
For Christ's sake.
I love him.

1108
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,340
The guy next door just like,
what the hell are we doing?

1109
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:51,760
Every time it rains hard and there's 
someone walking by ankle,

1110
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,040
ankle high,
I really cut out quick,

1111
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:58,450
but the next one's as good as against 
here and let's pull this one out.

1112
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,250
Ready?
They get a kind of new,

1113
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,480
they brought it in.
The northeast is more rain,

1114
00:57:03,481 --> 00:57:08,330
continues to fall today and be c's,
Michelle Kosinski and a coo.

1115
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,830
She's in a new way.
New Jersey this morning.

1116
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:11,940
Michelle,
good morning to you.

1117
00:57:11,941 --> 00:57:14,820
She's got a paddle,
she's paddling in her canoe is there,

1118
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,880
we're getting a nice break from the rain
but not the flooding.

1119
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:18,773
And somebody would literally walk two 
guys who are like fuck this lady walk 

1120
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:26,520
right in front of her.
And it's just at ankle depth.

1121
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,193
And what I love about the reporters is 
they call her out so great over in this 

1122
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,350
neighborhood.
Don't try to say,

1123
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:37,830
well she was standing on a shoe stands,
grassy water.

1124
00:57:37,831 --> 00:57:39,570
Would they uh,
there was a deep point,

1125
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,233
deep point,

1126
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,593
well canoe or boat when you're out in it
as much deeper back here because this 

1127
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:48,370
actually Michelle,
I'll take it.

1128
00:57:48,371 --> 00:57:51,510
Is there some kind of severe drop off 
there between the floor?

1129
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,580
Go back.
This guy's a second shall walk in.

1130
00:57:55,581 --> 00:58:00,581
Are these holy men walking on top of you
guys when you have a ride like this,

1131
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:05,120
why would you want to walk?
You run a short,

1132
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,083
you know,
it's funny.

1133
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:06,940
All

1134
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:10,780
the producers are probably in on it and 
they just tossed her ass bus hard.

1135
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,010
By the way,
shout out to Matt Lauer who actually had

1136
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:17,840
a button and is this is Matt Lauer?
Yeah,

1137
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,200
the button guy.
He hit a button in his office.

1138
00:58:20,201 --> 00:58:22,750
He got me to his stories.
One of my favorites.

1139
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:24,730
He gave him,
he me to it.

1140
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:26,500
He didn't get me to it.
Right.

1141
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,520
That's the term he got me to code.
He toured.

1142
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:34,350
He too.
Yeah,

1143
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,990
he too.
So He's,

1144
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:40,600
he's is one of my favorite c and this is
crazy.

1145
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:41,434
He had a button installed under his dad.
So when people are female interns or 

1146
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:49,660
whatever came into his office,
he had a button,

1147
00:58:49,661 --> 00:58:52,570
he would push that lock the fucking door
behind them.

1148
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:58,010
Oh,
how do you even think about that?

1149
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,153
That's like Dr Evil Shit.
A button that locks the door from the 

1150
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:04,923
outside.

1151
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,750
Anyway,
good shout out to Matt Lauer.

1152
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,660
How did they even explain that when he 
was like ordering it?

1153
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,260
You know like what do you put on the 
work order?

1154
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,840
Just put it on that.
What other men budget?

1155
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:19,990
They got all that.
They'll get out of their special effects

1156
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:20,960
budget.
Yeah,

1157
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,310
deep water because they weren't.
All right,

1158
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,680
I'm going to need a button.
Okay.

1159
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,203
Now what this button does is it locks 
the door from the outside so I can 

1160
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:34,610
really focus and get some work done.
Right now.

1161
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:36,980
Well now it's for me to be able to 
focus,

1162
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,000
but just hypothetically,
if somebody wanted to get out,

1163
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,430
they have to push this button under my 
desk to get out.

1164
00:59:43,431 --> 00:59:47,030
Now that's just to make sure that I can 
focus all the way that I need to.

1165
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,440
Five years dreams,
piece of video there,

1166
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:58,020
Michelle,
or hitting ground Michelle,

1167
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:04,660
of course.
I wonder if he ever pushed the button on

1168
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:07,124
her.
You know what I mean?

1169
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,150
Michelle?
We stepped into my office.

1170
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:10,853
Huh?

1171
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:17,070
I'm writing about in there the button.
What do you read your motto?

1172
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:17,760
Yeah,

1173
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,460
talk to me and it turns out he did not 
install it.

1174
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:26,020
It was a mechanism that was a standard 
feature in many of the older offices.

1175
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,530
That was like the whole story.
You're debunking that.

1176
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:31,980
Yeah.
Well what was the story?

1177
01:00:31,981 --> 01:00:33,390
What did he get in trouble for them?

1178
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:34,880
Okay,

1179
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,550
well it's more about the,
I think the actual personally yeah,

1180
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:40,250
he raped somebody.
No,

1181
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:41,084
I don't know what he did,
but sexual misconduct whenever there's 

1182
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:44,923
allegations,
but people were wondering about that if 

1183
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:49,510
he installed it personally.
Okay.

1184
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:50,383
So he did it.
That's just standard issue for sit back 

1185
01:00:52,481 --> 01:00:55,060
in the fifties yeah,
that was just standard.

1186
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:57,110
It make it better.
Um,

1187
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,710
okay.
Now moving on.

1188
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,110
Hmm.
Shout out to Matt Lauer.

1189
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:06,010
Hope he's doing good.
Wherever he is.

1190
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:12,070
Be Company at Ya BGP mean inception 90 
day fiance.

1191
01:01:12,341 --> 01:01:14,260
We all know and love this show very 
much.

1192
01:01:14,261 --> 01:01:17,110
I'm a huge fan of this show,
so it's on the sub reddit.

1193
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,780
There was a trailer for season six.
I have to tell you,

1194
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,710
90 day fiance is one of the most 
entertaining shows on television.

1195
01:01:23,711 --> 01:01:25,660
It is so insane.
It is.

1196
01:01:25,661 --> 01:01:27,820
So I don't even know how it's illegal.

1197
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:29,540
Yeah.

1198
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:34,190
To openly say to the United States 
government,

1199
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:38,330
I am coming with the intention of 
emigrating.

1200
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,230
That is like exactly what they say do 
not do because it's illegal,

1201
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,840
but it somehow tlc has figured it out 
anyway.

1202
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:47,330
And the trailer,
look what the fuck we found.

1203
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,153
I've lost all respect for myself.
There's a flute Ba trooper here and 

1204
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:56,690
season six trailer wearing fucking hd 
marriage.

1205
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:58,990
I can't wait to see this the season.
Well,

1206
01:01:58,991 --> 01:02:00,490
I've got the trailer and I watched it at
all.

1207
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,170
Yeah.
Here let's watch the trailer.

1208
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,090
And I kept reading.
Do you want more information about them?

1209
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,133
Tell me about Matt Lauer.
So the feature was a perk for top 

1210
01:02:08,501 --> 01:02:11,090
executives who wanted privacy.
Oh,

1211
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:12,043
personal calls or security.
But it's not clear how many people had 

1212
01:02:18,431 --> 01:02:20,190
it.
And he was one

1213
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,023
of very few,
if not the only one that had worn 

1214
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,753
whether weird story.
It did use it according to the 

1215
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:35,990
allegation that his,
so he used it.

1216
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,290
It did use it.
You had it and he used it.

1217
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:43,830
Allie allegedly.
That's crazy,

1218
01:02:45,021 --> 01:02:46,310
man.
Okay,

1219
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:48,890
let's watch.
I loved that.

1220
01:02:48,891 --> 01:02:51,320
I mean a fucking button that locks the 
door.

1221
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:56,000
Christ sweet.
Uh,

1222
01:02:56,001 --> 01:02:59,520

The trailer Tlc,

1223
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:01,760
lovedale everything tells,
he makes this great.

1224
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,550
The learning channel guys.
Cool.

1225
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,730
In 90 days we're going to be husband and
wife.

1226
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:11,590
You Rico,
people say girl,

1227
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,450
maybe she couldn't be.

1228
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:14,870
Maybe.
Maybe.

1229
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,200
Have you watched to see maybe the 
previous season?

1230
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,220
I'm just a dysfunctional broke white guy
with no prospects in life,

1231
01:03:22,221 --> 01:03:24,980
but some beautiful girl from Brazil is 
in love with me.

1232
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,920
Maybe she's using me those five items.
Seasons of,

1233
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,670
yeah,
maybe she's using me.

1234
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:36,530
Maybe she just likes my personality.
Yeah,

1235
01:03:36,531 --> 01:03:41,531
right.
The,

1236
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:46,950
the American guys are always like the 
most like weird socially awkward broke.

1237
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:49,933
No professional prospects.
Basically the most and data like very 

1238
01:03:53,451 --> 01:03:57,410
undateable in my opinion,
if I was gay versus what,

1239
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:58,580
Eh,
well,

1240
01:03:58,581 --> 01:04:01,250
you know,
an eligible bachelor.

1241
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:02,091
No,
but what is it?

1242
01:04:02,091 --> 01:04:04,460
Is it was really American and then,
yeah,

1243
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:07,400
it's always an American.
I think it's always an American guy.

1244
01:04:07,401 --> 01:04:08,234
Or is it?
Oh No.

1245
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:12,350
Oh,
there was one really big girl.

1246
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:13,591
Not,
I mean,

1247
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:15,210
I'm not going to say that.
Oh yeah,

1248
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,120
yeah,
yeah.

1249
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,750
That's not,
you know,

1250
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:19,940
some people aren't did that.
Not me.

1251
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,100
No.
It was a part of the story,

1252
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:27,020
but she's a huge girl and there was like
a super fit guy from Columbia.

1253
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:27,893
Yeah.
And he kept trying to get her to go to 

1254
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:34,300
the gym so he was not into that.
So she didn't want,

1255
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:36,750
yeah.
Well yeah,

1256
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:39,600
it's great man.
It's fucking amazing.

1257
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:41,710
This show is like trauma city,
usaid.

1258
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,593
So good.

1259
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:46,750
Hello on vacation.
Lost my virginity.

1260
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,410
And how has baby wow,
that's a lot.

1261
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,500
She's beautiful.
She's sexy.

1262
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,440
But his 90 days to get to know my 
mother.

1263
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,320
I live in the basement with my eight 
year old mom.

1264
01:04:59,321 --> 01:05:00,650
She's beautiful.
She's sex,

1265
01:05:00,651 --> 01:05:02,950
she's a supermodel.
Maybe she's using me.

1266
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:10,050
Maybe she just wants to come live with 
me and my mom in the basement I were.

1267
01:05:11,681 --> 01:05:14,140
And also I work at a,
I deliver pizzas.

1268
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:16,960
Not that they're,
I'm not degrading pizza drivers.

1269
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,880
I'm just saying these guys have no 
prospects.

1270
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:27,700
We get it.
She's so eager to me in lab.

1271
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,420
She's let's red flags.
If Jesus came down from heaven right now

1272
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:33,880
and said he cheated on me,
I wouldn't do anything about it.

1273
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:42,320
Finally,
there's also hope and romance as well.

1274
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:46,600
The music takes age and I'm going to be 
guiding in your bed day

1275
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:52,950
romantic.
He every day and oh my God,

1276
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,320
but so excited to finally see osweiler.
Oh whoa.

1277
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,673
This shit is so good.
We're not going to tell me not to touch 

1278
01:06:02,801 --> 01:06:05,170
my side.
I feel like a crazy.

1279
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:10,490
What are you talking about?
What is this baby?

1280
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,133
I'm a cat.

1281
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:23,160
She walks into this guys house which is 
full of garbage and flies and shit.

1282
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:28,050
Welcome to heaven baby.
She might be using me ground,

1283
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,253
so how concerned the life I have here 
isn't enough for her to clean up before 

1284
01:06:33,011 --> 01:06:34,630
it.
We're not getting a man.

1285
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:36,750
He hasn't

1286
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:41,750
and lady moved cross country 
internationally.

1287
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,823
Yup.
You can't even clean up all the Coffee 

1288
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,290
Cup.
Nope.

1289
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:51,290
That's molding fee does not need as you 
have.

1290
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:52,800
Boy,
I've lost.

1291
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:53,480
All right.

1292
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,770
I love this.
We've got a sleeper,

1293
01:06:55,771 --> 01:06:57,610
so we've got asleep.

1294
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,290
Oh yeah,
we've got a double agent.

1295
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,600
The perpetrator.
Ah,

1296
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:04,940
he's watching reach out.
Yeah.

1297
01:07:04,941 --> 01:07:05,940
Give us the email and dude,

1298
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:07,520
God,
I love it so much.

1299
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,440
What's it's been hard and it was 
struggling.

1300
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:12,960
Are you doing this because you have this
baby?

1301
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:13,970
He's why I love these words.

1302
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:15,470
Sure.
Like everyday apparently.

1303
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,370
What is he one of the subjects or does 
he like a brother?

1304
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,113
Sister?
Yeah.

1305
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:23,210
That's daddy's getting.
Got It.

1306
01:07:23,211 --> 01:07:23,751
Got It.
Got It.

1307
01:07:23,751 --> 01:07:27,350
Yeah.
That bitch is for his money period.

1308
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,690
Anyway.
Oh my Jesus Christ.

1309
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:34,691
Look at this Guy Craig.
I'm not saying that.

1310
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:37,650
I mean that guy is not a catch.
I'm sorry.

1311
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,530
All right.
Enough about this guy.

1312
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:43,550
He might be,
he might be.

1313
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,020
He's going to give her the d all night 
long.

1314
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,750
The point is that

1315
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,490
it's generally one person is way out of 
the other person's league.

1316
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,833
Yeah.
And one person who is wade delusional 

1317
01:07:56,430 --> 01:07:57,263
and one person has the opportunity to 
give the other person where the League 

1318
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:01,410
of Isa.
Okay.

1319
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,980
You guys get the fucking idea.
Um,

1320
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,440
oh yeah.
Guys,

1321
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:12,620
if you have any questions or you want 
our opinion on something,

1322
01:08:12,841 --> 01:08:15,830
you want to show us something.
You want me to talk something,

1323
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:16,723
email us.
I want to start answering emails every 

1324
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:21,284
episode.
So email 

1325
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:26,501
us@podcastaththreehthreeproductions.com.
What else we got?

1326
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,760
Um,
yes,

1327
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:36,950
some thing I've got the fat shaming 
fashion revolve the drop.

1328
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,130
Yeah.
There's a company called revolve,

1329
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:43,700
which is a fashion company that teamed 
up with Lena Dunham.

1330
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,083
Actually,
I don't know what Lena Dunham and 

1331
01:08:45,861 --> 01:08:47,150
thought.
So she comedian,

1332
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,800
I just hear a name all the time.
Oh,

1333
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:52,640
she's a writer.
Um,

1334
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:53,933
at any rate,
she worked on a collaboration with this 

1335
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,720
company and it's a female empowerment 
colab.

1336
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:09,650
So the idea behind it was that they 
wanted to make clothes that,

1337
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:13,310
you know,
promoted body positivity.

1338
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,153
So with that in mind,
let me show you what the final product 

1339
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:19,600
was.
Um,

1340
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:22,500
so here you go.
Oh,

1341
01:09:22,501 --> 01:09:23,910
I can't,
I can't expand it.

1342
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:27,040
That fun.
Sometimes it does what?

1343
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:30,120
It does,
it definitely his fault.

1344
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:35,790
Why is that?
So just zooming on the page.

1345
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:38,490
Usually when you click it,
it just pops out.

1346
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:39,830
That's,
sorry,

1347
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,150
let me try refresh it.
Well,

1348
01:09:42,151 --> 01:09:42,901
any,
oh man,

1349
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:47,320
that's kind of annoying.
Dad Page can write.

1350
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:51,180
Try right clicking it and view image.
I'm not doing that.

1351
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:52,950
So,
um,

1352
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:58,410
here's a beautiful skinny model that 
says two bony to be bombed.

1353
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:03,720
So the idea was that they took quotes,
hurtful quotes,

1354
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:06,480
and they used it as armor to be like,
Hey,

1355
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:13,350
your words don't hurt me.
So horrible result of modern feminism.

1356
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:14,920
Okay.

1357
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,950
Slut feminist nightmare to bind to be 
bond.

1358
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:22,030
If you translated a bomb onto her face,
she'd have a better faith.

1359
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:26,140
And of course here again,
being fat is not beautiful.

1360
01:10:26,141 --> 01:10:26,974
It's an excuse.
Imagine that one is the worst 

1361
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:33,550
[inaudible] girl that imagine wearing 
that.

1362
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:40,950
So people look at this $170 being fat is
not bad if fall,

1363
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,830
it's an excuse.
Like Oh,

1364
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:46,810
fit.
Yeah.

1365
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,543
Oh,
so they missed the mark so much what 

1366
01:10:52,451 --> 01:10:55,180
happened here?
Clearly I guess they meant the heavy,

1367
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,090
heavier size.
Yeah.

1368
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,173
You know,
it's still a weird shirt if I'm being 

1369
01:11:01,241 --> 01:11:02,710
honest.
It is.

1370
01:11:02,711 --> 01:11:07,150
But this combination or are small,
right?

1371
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:10,270
You cannot tell that it's a quote.
Yeah.

1372
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:13,840
But either way,
the beautiful fit model was just a,

1373
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,820
so people got so upset and everyone 
wants the Xing,

1374
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:19,770
apologies and whatever,
whatever.

1375
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,580
To me,
this image really just is what I love so

1376
01:11:23,581 --> 01:11:26,460
much.
Being fat is not beautiful.

1377
01:11:26,461 --> 01:11:31,461
It's an excuse I earned 70 bucks.
So thank you to Lena Dunham and um,

1378
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:39,570
we've all revolve for this 
collaboration.

1379
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:46,310
How we manage.
This is a really crazy on how we mendo

1380
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:57,410
tell us Tyra Bank live on America's got 
talent that she has fake hair.

1381
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:00,890
Now I guess this is a somewhat common 
thing of,

1382
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:05,630
of females,
I guess black females have a lot of them

1383
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,464
have fake hair weave.
We watch a whole documentary the Chris 

1384
01:12:10,731 --> 01:12:13,100
rock made called like good hair or 
something.

1385
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:15,720
It was really interesting because I 
don't think he made it.

1386
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,120
Yeah,
I think it was Chris Rock.

1387
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,133
Hmm.
And I didn't actually know this was a 

1388
01:12:20,481 --> 01:12:21,314
thing,
but a lot of black women have fake hair 

1389
01:12:23,931 --> 01:12:26,420
like from India.
So their hair,

1390
01:12:26,421 --> 01:12:27,254
they have like tiny little corn,
corn rows and then they weave real hair 

1391
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:36,860
of like straight or wavy hair and they 
have like really elaborate weaves.

1392
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,160
Apparently you're not supposed to touch 
a black woman's hair.

1393
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:42,463
Actually,
even a lot of white women have 

1394
01:12:44,181 --> 01:12:47,150
extensions now.
So extensions.

1395
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:47,901
Yeah.
No,

1396
01:12:47,901 --> 01:12:50,110
it's crazy.
Like extensions,

1397
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:50,953
like I've seen it where you take the 
extensions out and it's just like three 

1398
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:58,650
times as much volume.
It's like,

1399
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:03,651
what the hell?
I don't really personally care that much

1400
01:13:03,661 --> 01:13:05,450
about the whole hair thing,
but the hey,

1401
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,393
women want to feel beautiful.
They want to do their thing and got in 

1402
01:13:08,491 --> 01:13:09,324
Boston anyway,
how we apparently knows because they 

1403
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:13,434
spend a lot of time backstage together.
The tyra has fake hair and so that 

1404
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,410
probably is what makes us even more 
embarrassing.

1405
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,630
So let us enjoy

1406
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:28,100
the facial hair.
How does it feel with all that fake hair

1407
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:28,934
on yourself?
I don't have no idea what that feels 

1408
01:13:29,721 --> 01:13:30,880
like.
I don't care.

1409
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:32,750
That wasn't a fake.
That was his real hair.

1410
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:34,220
Oh,
I see what you did.

1411
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:35,830
You see what she did?
No,

1412
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:41,200
she has fake hair.
It's a Joe Walsh.

1413
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:43,940
It's so bad.
Huh?

1414
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:48,430
He genuinely thinks that she's setting 
them up for like a,

1415
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:51,080
a gag.
I don't know.

1416
01:13:51,081 --> 01:13:54,810
It was he thinking and is just really 
trying to make a joke,

1417
01:13:54,811 --> 01:13:56,510
but it was so bad.
Well,

1418
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:58,650
she said,
I have no idea what it feels like.

1419
01:13:58,651 --> 01:14:00,330
That fake hair.
Yeah.

1420
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:03,210
And so he was like making a joke,
I think.

1421
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,220
No,
but then I think he really was like,

1422
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,410
oh my God,
what did I say here?

1423
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:08,244
I'm in here watching.

1424
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:13,490
She thinks it's a joke.
It's okay.

1425
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,880
Okay.
I wasn't talking about her head.

1426
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,280
You were like,
yeah,

1427
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,650
I do.
I guess it's going.

1428
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:23,710
This is live TV.
Okay,

1429
01:14:23,711 --> 01:14:25,630
we're moving on.
I know we have to move on.

1430
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:27,400
Isn't this discussing?
Okay.

1431
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:32,040
Ooh.
Tyra is not happy.

1432
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,150
Yeah,
I mean it's,

1433
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,640
I mean,
Shit.

1434
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:39,490
I gotta watch that again.
Talking about her head.

1435
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,560
That was an awful site,
by the way,

1436
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,980
has fake hair.
It's a joke

1437
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:48,940
that,
that this was real when he's like,

1438
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,793
Whoa,
Shit.

1439
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:51,430
Right.
In real.

1440
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,150
What do you mean?
Well,

1441
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:52,781
cause he was like,
oh,

1442
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:53,900
I shouldn't have said that.
Yeah.

1443
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,333
Of them.

1444
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:57,050
No,
it's okay.

1445
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:03,130
I think he was trying to make a joke,
but it was really the one wrong.

1446
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,990
So tyra has fake hair,
to be honest.

1447
01:15:05,991 --> 01:15:09,620
I wouldn't have guessed it because 
usually you can see it in the forehead.

1448
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:11,030
I don't know.
That's a really good weaver.

1449
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,930
She's rich.
She got that crazy fucking weeps.

1450
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:17,720
Yeah.
You don't want it to be noticeable.

1451
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:19,520
Sure.
But it's pretty,

1452
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,070
I mean,
well,

1453
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:22,370
so what the hell does it look like when 
she takes her hair off?

1454
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,293
Oh,
no,

1455
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:25,850
you don't know about it.
I don't think you'd take it off.

1456
01:15:25,851 --> 01:15:27,710
I don't warn you when you go through 
there Barbara,

1457
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:28,970
you keep it on all the time.
Yeah.

1458
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,940
And they fix it up.
You guys should watch this documentary.

1459
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:33,830
Good hair by Chris rock is really 
interesting.

1460
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:37,510
Um,
Tara,

1461
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:39,253
how are we fascinating stuff guys.
We've got great content here on the h 

1462
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:46,040
street podcast and you don't ever want 
to miss a single episode because,

1463
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:46,874
uh,
you just don't know what's coming next 

1464
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:53,180
and that radio.
Yup.

1465
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:55,550
We don't even know what's coming next.
Nobody knows.

1466
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:57,170
Guys,
have you seen this?

1467
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:01,730
Um,
Joey Salads?

1468
01:16:01,731 --> 01:16:03,590
This is kind of a,
I don't know this,

1469
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,780
I don't know when it's from,
but I love this.

1470
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:06,773
I am.
I don't think I've watched it with you 

1471
01:16:07,281 --> 01:16:10,410
guys before,
but vitaly sod,

1472
01:16:10,411 --> 01:16:13,970
Joey Salads at a gym and like,
uh,

1473
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,833
confronted him because Joe said that he 
wanted to fuck his mom or something and 

1474
01:16:19,131 --> 01:16:20,780
it's just,
it's so priceless.

1475
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:21,643
I got to tell you it's not racing 
because vitale this days look like 

1476
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:28,670
Dragon Ball Z.
Does Eric there?

1477
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,600
Oh Man.
Vitaly looks crazy.

1478
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:33,020
No,
he says show afterwards.

1479
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:36,560
It looks like Bruno from Ali G.
Well,

1480
01:16:36,561 --> 01:16:37,394
anyway,
here he is.

1481
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:39,843
What up guys?
So I just walked in the gym and it 

1482
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:42,100
gives,
what a fucking seat.

1483
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:45,480
I see Joey fucking the salads,
the big

1484
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:46,720
Gino.
What the tally.

1485
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:48,000
Don't fucking,
don't,

1486
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:50,850
don't put disrespect on Joey.
Sal's name.

1487
01:16:50,851 --> 01:16:54,420
All right,
Joey Salads.

1488
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,870
He's a guy.
You know what?

1489
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,840
And that's fine.
You're fine.

1490
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,650
It's the front of the show.
But uh,

1491
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:03,000
he's got a lot of dressing on that 
salad.

1492
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:08,730
Me Disrespecting me,
my mother saying he wants,

1493
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:13,190
my mother says he wants to fuck my 
mother talking all this smack,

1494
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:17,240
making videos online.
I'll walk into the gym at me.

1495
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,310
You threw that up on the treadmill and 
now he's gone.

1496
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:26,950
I think he's in the locker room.
Why are you sending me Google Vitaly?

1497
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,210
2018 that's the first result.
Well,

1498
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:33,643
I got to talk all this shit.
What do you mean all the videos he made 

1499
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,150
sure.
Talking Shit about my mom.

1500
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:41,870
The one video I made a year ago.
It's not a catchy boy band.

1501
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:45,230
Walcott.
I'm in front of you right now.

1502
01:17:45,231 --> 01:17:46,910
What you're going to do about it?
You got to talk shit about me.

1503
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,340
That old.
If he's got dongles.

1504
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,600
When I was waiting for this moment to 
happen,

1505
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,960
I'm not to lie now.
I met you in person.

1506
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:56,060
You're going to talk shit about my mom.

1507
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,980
Have ever spoken anything about about 
your mom?

1508
01:17:58,290 --> 01:17:59,570
No,
exactly.

1509
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:01,310
So why would you fuck you?
Fuck you.

1510
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:02,150
You should be.
No,

1511
01:18:02,151 --> 01:18:03,530
it's not jokes.
I'm here in front of you.

1512
01:18:03,531 --> 01:18:06,440
What you're going to say about it?
I got to say it's just stupid.

1513
01:18:06,441 --> 01:18:07,940
Youtube stupid.
Yeah,

1514
01:18:07,941 --> 01:18:08,774
exactly.
Because everybody who has something bad 

1515
01:18:10,741 --> 01:18:12,670
to say about you on the call.
If I see him in person,

1516
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:17,680
of course I will.
Of course I will because yeah,

1517
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:20,810
and your boys not going to help you.
I'm serious,

1518
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,840
I'll beat your fucking ass with my right
hand while I'm talking with my left.

1519
01:18:23,841 --> 01:18:24,674
And it's not petty.
You fucking disrespected my mother and 

1520
01:18:25,911 --> 01:18:27,950
you don't disrespect it.
Well maybe in this country you can.

1521
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:30,830
Not In fucking Russia.
Did I disrespect your mother?

1522
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,330
I didn't need it to heat disrespectful.
You said you weren't.

1523
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,010
And Joey does tend to think that 
whatever he does on youtube doesn't mean

1524
01:18:38,011 --> 01:18:41,790
anything.
Like a fake black lives matter.

1525
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:46,320
Trump car experiment.
He's missing.

1526
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:48,750
I Dunno.
Oh my God.

1527
01:18:48,751 --> 01:18:50,850
Look at this picture of a tally.
Let me pull this up.

1528
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:57,940
Villain Rocky or Dragon Ball Z.
Seriously look like man.

1529
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,030
He looks like a suit.
Like,

1530
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:07,580
yeah,

1531
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,950
Ivan Drago and that's the,
that's the guy from rocky.

1532
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:12,200
I mean he looks like he's on his way to 
shoot a gay porn.

1533
01:19:12,201 --> 01:19:14,900
And I mean,
I don't mean to say like this is like,

1534
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:16,450
yeah,

1535
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:19,810
I mean he's got the bleached tips.
It's got the pink top

1536
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,860
there.
You went to the muscles Ila.

1537
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:29,460
I actually am not at all.
Thank God not to this level.

1538
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,540
I don't.
What is the,

1539
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:33,200
what's the good amount of muscle for 
you?

1540
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,233
Well there's some in his new vlog where 
you were pointing out to me are today 

1541
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,393
were his big driving his car and his 
dear friend is recording from the side 

1542
01:19:42,671 --> 01:19:44,830
and his arm.
He's like taking up the whole screen.

1543
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,420
What is that?
I just,

1544
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:52,120
I get the feeling like when dudes get 
this jacked,

1545
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:53,343
they do it for each other.
I don't think that many women like 

1546
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:01,150
that's why I like trying to say bar 
women with all the surgeries.

1547
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,553
I felt like it becomes like a 
competition between themselves and I 

1548
01:20:05,171 --> 01:20:06,970
don't even think of the guys even care.
No,

1549
01:20:06,971 --> 01:20:07,804
I think so.
Like of course like a jack do with like 

1550
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:15,570
a six pack is attractive and looks good 
and you like that.

1551
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:18,360
But like at what point like here at Dan 
just sent me this photo.

1552
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,480
Like when you get like Mister Universe 
jacked,

1553
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:22,493
I feel like that's just the dude.
There's nothing wrong with him in the 

1554
01:20:25,561 --> 01:20:26,460
before picture.

1555
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,590
Okay,
that's great.

1556
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:34,530
You're not,
you're an everyday man girl.

1557
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,560
Um,
but at any rate,

1558
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:38,580
I just,
I saw him,

1559
01:20:38,581 --> 01:20:39,414
he's like working out with all of his 
dudes and they're all getting like 

1560
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:42,204
jacked as fuck and they're all like 
checking each other out and they're all 

1561
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:45,090
like,
almost naked.

1562
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,530
I was like,
this is gay.

1563
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,410
There's nothing wrong with that.
But like this looks like,

1564
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,180
you know,
God bless some,

1565
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,840
maybe you'll find out something new that
is into something funny about that.

1566
01:20:59,101 --> 01:21:03,330
Just a bunch of naked dudes lifting boy 
boyfriend joke had joe.

1567
01:21:03,331 --> 01:21:04,290
You're right.
He was like,

1568
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:05,940
you and your boyfriend here,
Joey.

1569
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:07,390
Is that what he said?
I think,

1570
01:21:07,391 --> 01:21:09,750
hey joey,
they might make a good couple.

1571
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:13,380
I think they can make some really good 
prank together.

1572
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:15,640
And you know,
Joe,

1573
01:21:15,641 --> 01:21:20,641
he's no stranger to two gay porn.
He had a whole tumblr page for gay men.

1574
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:22,223
I don't know if you guys know that.
He had this whole thing where he's 

1575
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:28,050
putting his dick in a hot dog bun and 
putting like mustard on it.

1576
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:28,884
And his roommate was recording it and 
they started putting it on tumbler and 

1577
01:21:32,461 --> 01:21:35,220
they had a whole huge following.
Oh my God.

1578
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,223
It's news to me.
Beautiful following of a gay men 

1579
01:21:39,151 --> 01:21:41,090
following him.
Yeah.

1580
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:43,500
And I think at one point he just got,
he was like,

1581
01:21:43,501 --> 01:21:46,430
what am I doing?
Any ratio is a real variety man.

1582
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,760
Yeah.
And I'll tell you,

1583
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:51,000
and let me say something about Joey,
when he was any here,

1584
01:21:51,001 --> 01:21:55,650
I shook his hand.
He has the softest fucking hand lotion.

1585
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,200
Like Bro,
I touched his hand and I was like,

1586
01:21:58,201 --> 01:22:02,570
what is your hands?
So Sasha and himself before he can't go,

1587
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:03,630
I don't know.
You know,

1588
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:07,013
you know,
do your thing and nothing wrong with 

1589
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:13,463
that.

1590
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:21,290
I was gay.
I would suck so much dick like you.

1591
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,260
Would you choose vitale or joey to would
I fuck.

1592
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:28,280
Wow.
That's a fun,

1593
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:29,183
that's a tough one.
Well I know vitaly can't even get it up 

1594
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:34,270
from the big bucks.
That is Joe.

1595
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,900
He seems like he has a sweet thought.
If I'm being honest,

1596
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:39,240
the tally seems totally unhinged and 
insane.

1597
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:40,793
Joey,
he seems to have a sweet soul and you 

1598
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:46,260
know those soft hands would,
would be,

1599
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:51,290
would have me here in a split second.
So you're more of a personality I think.

1600
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:59,250
Joey,
I think I'll go with jelly all day.

1601
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:01,770
Joe,
if you're listening,

1602
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:06,670
Jerry's going to cut part and upload it 
to his channel.

1603
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,440
H three wants to date.
Joey.

1604
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:09,061
Stop.
Yeah.

1605
01:23:09,061 --> 01:23:09,894
I want to fuck Joe.
I put your Dick in a hot dog bun and a 

1606
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:14,560
damn split.
The damn second guys,

1607
01:23:14,561 --> 01:23:15,490
we have the best content here.

1608
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:18,100
Do we not?
What else?

1609
01:23:18,101 --> 01:23:19,540
Goop.
You guys heard about,

1610
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:20,261
oh,
you know goop.

1611
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:21,094
We always make fun of goop when we do 
like quick reads cause they say it's an 

1612
01:23:24,851 --> 01:23:28,150
oprah is leads in goop and I was like,
what the fuck is goop?

1613
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:30,310
Goop?
Gwyneth Paltrow,

1614
01:23:30,311 --> 01:23:35,110
the actress owns this magazine called 
Coop and actually we've spoke about in a

1615
01:23:35,111 --> 01:23:40,090
magazine style.
It's a multimillion company lost.

1616
01:23:40,091 --> 01:23:41,770
First of all it's like what kind of name
is goop?

1617
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,230
Apparently she has her initials,
Gwyneth Paltrow,

1618
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:45,100
GP,
and she's like,

1619
01:23:45,101 --> 01:23:48,730
I wanted a name that meant everything 
and anything and nothing.

1620
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,640
I was like,
goop is a pretty literal,

1621
01:23:51,641 --> 01:23:54,850
that's just like a sound of like,
yeah,

1622
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,600
it's like it's gross.
It's like when you take a shit when shit

1623
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:00,790
comes out of your ass,
goop like that.

1624
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:01,750
Sound effect.
You keep playing.

1625
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:07,820
It's kind of pretty goopy type of a 
good.

1626
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:10,683
So anyway,
we spoke briefly about goop before 

1627
01:24:12,011 --> 01:24:12,844
because they got in trouble for selling 
stickers that were apparently and fused 

1628
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:22,590
with NASA technology to increase your 
energy level.

1629
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:25,690
And that's the total scheme.
What the fuck?

1630
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:26,913
But now they're back.
They're being sued again because they 

1631
01:24:29,591 --> 01:24:33,630
have vaginal eggs.
Uh,

1632
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,760
jade eggs that you insert in your 
vagina.

1633
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,713
Fantastic stuff.
Let me pull up some pictures that are 

1634
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:43,760
appropriate for everyone.
You know,

1635
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:47,740
I was more fascinated by this,
this egg.

1636
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:49,293
Um,
I don't want you to see this photo 

1637
01:24:51,311 --> 01:24:52,630
because it's really graphic.
Well,

1638
01:24:52,631 --> 01:24:53,560
here,
let me show you this.

1639
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:54,753
So it's like an egg that you shove up 
your badge and you keep it there like 

1640
01:24:56,951 --> 01:24:59,320
all day.
It's crazy.

1641
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,090
What do you think about that?
I mean,

1642
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:04,090
I don't have you here.
I'll read it,

1643
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:05,230
I'll read it.
I'll tell you all about it.

1644
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:08,140
That was very uncomfortable.
Um,

1645
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:11,800
here I've got the whole,
I got the low down here.

1646
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
So here there's a picture of,
basically it's a drawing,

1647
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:19,040
but I don't want to show it.
But you,

1648
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:19,611
you,
you,

1649
01:25:19,611 --> 01:25:20,660
you know what to do.
You know what?

1650
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:24,280
You put it up there.
I'm like a Tampon I guess,

1651
01:25:24,281 --> 01:25:26,260
but except the giant stone.

1652
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:33,070
Um,
from Kegels to vaginal steaming.

1653
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:37,030
We're not shy here at goop.
Apparently not.

1654
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:42,670
Apparently don't think much either.
We don't think much here at goop.

1655
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,470
Why not?
I love this.

1656
01:25:44,471 --> 01:25:49,000
They call it a strictly guarded secret 
of Chinese royalty,

1657
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:54,790
queens and concubines.
Use them to stay in shape for emperors.

1658
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:59,590
Jade eggs were said to harness the power
of energy work and crystal healing.

1659
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:01,203
Shivah rose has been working with them 
for about seven years and raves about 

1660
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:08,720
the results.
Jade Aix power to cleanse and clear make

1661
01:26:08,721 --> 01:26:12,550
them ideal for spiritual detox.
Hmm.

1662
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:13,873
You still have any questions that does 
that explain everything I'm jade eggs 

1663
01:26:18,531 --> 01:26:21,710
can help cultivate sexual energy.
Clear Ci,

1664
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,040
uh,
yeah,

1665
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:24,913
cultivating,
intensify it and femininity and 

1666
01:26:27,171 --> 01:26:29,990
invigorate our life force just to name a
few.

1667
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:35,420
It's a holistic combination of things 
where one benefits builds to another.

1668
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:36,283
Jade also takes away negative energy.
It's a very heavy material and 

1669
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,593
incidentally it just shoves really 
easily run up to your fucking badge 

1670
01:26:46,431 --> 01:26:47,264
hole.

1671
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:50,270
That's folder for them to write.
Um,

1672
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:53,150
they did not.
Anyway,

1673
01:26:53,151 --> 01:26:55,860
this shit's hilarious.
I'm bummed it was just,

1674
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,280
that all sounds great.
You can try it,

1675
01:26:58,281 --> 01:26:59,114
bro.
I got anal egg still works and stomping 

1676
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:06,110
is right.
Um,

1677
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:08,780
how do we start and when you first get 
your egg,

1678
01:27:08,781 --> 01:27:11,360
boil it right.
It's a sacred space.

1679
01:27:11,361 --> 01:27:15,200
They'll make sure plane for me it's 
about physical cleaner.

1680
01:27:15,201 --> 01:27:17,330
You could put it under the light of a 
full moon,

1681
01:27:17,331 --> 01:27:19,470
the clench or recharge it.
Oh my God.

1682
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:23,780
What the fuck?
Or You could burn sage.

1683
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:24,763
The egg does absorb energy.
So I like how they go from NASA energy 

1684
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:32,380
to Chinese,
I dunno,

1685
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:34,010
uh,
Chinese secrets.

1686
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:35,053
You know what goop is?
It's the sound that at jade egg makes 

1687
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:40,280
when a plops out of your vege.
Uh,

1688
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,740
before I insert an egg,
I'll do our ritual.

1689
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,660
I'll place it on a beautiful piece of 
fabric,

1690
01:27:44,661 --> 01:27:45,494
light a candle,
and then shove it up my fucking nasty 

1691
01:27:47,211 --> 01:27:49,670
snatch for my ritual.

1692
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:50,533
I'll imagine pure light flowing from my 
nasty snatch and shove an egg in there 

1693
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,280
who really expensive that's supposedly 
likes,

1694
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:00,080
I don't know anything it's due.
There's somewhere in there.

1695
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:02,810
No,
no,

1696
01:28:02,811 --> 01:28:04,280
it's some,
it's some lady,

1697
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:09,740
one of their editors I would assume 
always rapped the egg and sell,

1698
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:14,600
keep it clean and start on an altar on 
the why.

1699
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:17,830
It should take a sacred place in your 
life and alter does that,

1700
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:23,440
it's like a sacred podium and an egg 
gets stuck or lost?

1701
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:29,210
Good question.
I don't a good question.

1702
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,760
This is the most common question we get 
and no,

1703
01:28:31,761 --> 01:28:32,594
it cannot get lost.
Depending on the size of your cabin or 

1704
01:28:35,031 --> 01:28:40,031
as cavernous giant vege it could get 
lost for a couple of weeks depending on,

1705
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:44,900
on uh,
how fast your vagina is.

1706
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:47,870
No,
they say no it cannot get lost.

1707
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:48,823
What about stock?
But there are ones that have a toll 

1708
01:28:51,221 --> 01:28:52,054
drilled in them so that you can bungy in
and splunk into her vagina and follow 

1709
01:28:56,521 --> 01:28:59,120
the lifeline to the egg.

1710
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:04,830
Now you can put a through the egg and to
make it easy to take out.

1711
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,610
Like way.
If you were to spelunk into a cavern,

1712
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,790
know it's spelunking is that's cave 
diving.

1713
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:14,573
Yeah,
I remember that from the prank 

1714
01:29:16,431 --> 01:29:20,780
conversion spelunking away.
Are there people who should not use jade

1715
01:29:20,781 --> 01:29:22,080
eggs?
Very good question.

1716
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,140
If you're on your cycle,
do not use it out of people.

1717
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:29,100
If you're pregnant,
do not shove that egg in there.

1718
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,230
Okay?
A man,

1719
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:36,390
if you have a function and brain,
do not shove it in I yeah,

1720
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:37,283
exactly.
People will functioning bridge to not 

1721
01:29:38,731 --> 01:29:40,050
use jade egg.
So there it is.

1722
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:42,293
So what happened is that uh,
so what happened was that they're being 

1723
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:50,370
sued for basically making 
unsubstantiated,

1724
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,740
unscientific,
untested claims.

1725
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:55,380
Basically everything I just read people 
like less bullshit.

1726
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:56,873
You cannot say that.
And they came into a and they're being 

1727
01:29:59,821 --> 01:30:00,810
sued for it.
Oh Man.

1728
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:02,060
Oh they did.
So yeah.

1729
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:06,500
Why are you so familiar?
Because they paid one 50.

1730
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:08,610
Oh,
they lost 145,000

1731
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:09,840
so there you go.
I'm more,

1732
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:11,670
I'm just more interested in the egg 
itself.

1733
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:16,830
That product is incredible.
How much is it?

1734
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:18,043
It's like $70 70 bucks.
Not Bad for a not bad for a a rock that 

1735
01:30:26,071 --> 01:30:27,570
you shove up your fucking ass hole.

1736
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:30,693
Hmm.

1737
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:36,560
It's nine to santee Iraq.
I got a couple of rocks.

1738
01:30:36,561 --> 01:30:39,890
If you guys want for 60 bucks,
you can shove up your house or they jade

1739
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:42,890
or the recharge by the energy of the 
moon.

1740
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:44,920
Yes.
Oh fuck yeah.

1741
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:49,910
I'll bet there's another headline.
Fortnight has been said it and more than

1742
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:53,570
200 divorce proceedings.
That's it.

1743
01:30:53,571 --> 01:30:56,030
There's really nothing more than that.
And finally guys,

1744
01:30:56,031 --> 01:30:58,850
we do have an email.
If you guys have emails,

1745
01:30:58,851 --> 01:31:00,050
questions,
concerns,

1746
01:31:00,051 --> 01:31:01,310
you want to hear us talk about 
something,

1747
01:31:01,311 --> 01:31:05,660
make sure to email 
podcast@hdhdproductions.com

1748
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,033
I have got an email to close up the show
today from a sweet young man named 

1749
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:13,970
Daniel.
Now,

1750
01:31:13,971 --> 01:31:14,804
Daniel,
like many of you out there are young 

1751
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:19,100
men,
impressionable minds who are looking for

1752
01:31:19,101 --> 01:31:21,560
answers and better ways to live,
a more holistic,

1753
01:31:21,561 --> 01:31:26,561
a natural life.
And he heard our discussion mine and um,

1754
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:32,360
burt's about wiping,
how we wipe from the front that we march

1755
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:36,410
to the beat of our own.
What we marched,

1756
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:38,360
we marched from the front.
Others,

1757
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:40,910
they wiped from the back.
The normal.

1758
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,680
Well,
normal is a subjective term,

1759
01:31:43,681 --> 01:31:45,180
Mila.
And I want him to go that far.

1760
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:49,880
I say a normal man.
The Standard Pazi body positivity.

1761
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:53,563
So I'm going to read this email.
I thought it was a great email and I 

1762
01:31:55,491 --> 01:31:57,170
wanted to share it with all you guys 
and,

1763
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:58,573
and it really,
and it created a new dimension on this 

1764
01:32:01,121 --> 01:32:03,730
whole conversation about front wiping 
verse back,

1765
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:07,360
wiping something that I had,
which was an unintended consequence,

1766
01:32:07,361 --> 01:32:10,120
but a wonderful consequence of it.
So,

1767
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:12,350
um,
let me begin here.

1768
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:20,690
Dear Ethan,
for 25 years,

1769
01:32:21,230 --> 01:32:22,063
I have been a back wiping neanderthal.
Today I am proud to say that I have 

1770
01:32:26,661 --> 01:32:27,494
thrown in the toilet paper and have 
committed to front wiping moving 

1771
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,233
forward.
I was first introduced to front wiping 

1772
01:32:34,761 --> 01:32:38,900
in high school when a participant on a 
reality show reveal to his peers that he

1773
01:32:38,901 --> 01:32:39,734
wiped from the front.
I like the other people on the show was 

1774
01:32:42,651 --> 01:32:43,484
disgusted by the thought of it.
It garnered the typical reaction that 

1775
01:32:47,331 --> 01:32:48,164
most unenlightened people have where 
they imagined smearing feces up their 

1776
01:32:51,801 --> 01:32:52,634
ball sack.

1777
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,953
Out of my own curiosity,
I tried it one day and confirm my own 

1778
01:32:56,301 --> 01:32:59,840
suspicion that it wasn't insufficient 
way of cleaning my ass.

1779
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:02,810
And due to my naivety,
however,

1780
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:06,950
oh due to my own naivety,
however,

1781
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:12,130
I now realize I was doing it incorrectly
by converting my own stand up,

1782
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,910
back wiping technique to a front style 
that was wildly uncomfortable.

1783
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:20,960
Fast forward 10 years later and a big 
fan of your show,

1784
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:23,780
I was disappointed to be faced with the 
issue.

1785
01:33:23,781 --> 01:33:24,614
Once again,
you spoke with Tom Sikora and Chris 

1786
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:29,570
Delea.
I found myself disagreeing with you as I

1787
01:33:29,571 --> 01:33:33,170
had an already settled this debate 
myself as a teenager.

1788
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:34,783
It was not until your episode with Bert 
Kreischer that I was willing to give 

1789
01:33:37,131 --> 01:33:37,964
front what being a second chance when I 
learned that you remain seated through 

1790
01:33:42,591 --> 01:33:43,424
the experience,
I realized I had made a mistake in my 

1791
01:33:46,041 --> 01:33:46,874
past experience.
Then something that either you or bird 

1792
01:33:49,641 --> 01:33:53,900
said really clicked with me.
It does not make sense to wipe a whole.

1793
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:59,140
It needs to be a scoop in order to clean
and I do believe that was after this,

1794
01:34:01,911 --> 01:34:06,470
I was reading in three Coupe Ila please.
We're talking about scooping.

1795
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:09,650
This is personal and spiritual.

1796
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:12,553
After this I was ready to truly open 
myself to change and why I'm wiping 

1797
01:34:15,921 --> 01:34:18,680
technique.
While it felt a bit weird at first,

1798
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:23,420
I have been blown away by the results.
First off,

1799
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:27,560
it is more natural reach as opposed to 
the awkward and standing up and reaching

1800
01:34:27,561 --> 01:34:29,420
backwards.
You don't need to stand up.

1801
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:33,770
I stay seated.
A lot of people stand up.

1802
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:34,813
You guys back there?
Do you stand up when you wipe from the 

1803
01:34:36,291 --> 01:34:38,300
back?
Uh,

1804
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,880
it's more of like a,
a slight lift and you left.

1805
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:43,910
You left.
Well,

1806
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:46,820
it's still technically seated.
I'd say somewhere in between.

1807
01:34:46,821 --> 01:34:47,654
It's a lift.
A lot of standalone wipe again can I 

1808
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:50,640
didn't get,
I,

1809
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,770
I,
this is emotional.

1810
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:55,610
This is important to me.
First off,

1811
01:34:55,611 --> 01:34:56,444
it is more natural reach as opposed to 
the awkward standup and reaching 

1812
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:00,740
backwards.
Secondly,

1813
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:05,741
I'm able to perform a quick couple of 
scoop scoop.

1814
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:07,790
It's what he Rowan's when I said,
God damn it.

1815
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:08,624
This is the truth as opposed to a rough 
wipe that only makes the task harder as 

1816
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:16,610
you smear shit up your ass crack.
And lastly,

1817
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:19,670
I'm able to finish in less wipes with a 
cleaner result.

1818
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:23,900
I just wanted to thank you for your 
continued efforts.

1819
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:27,920
If you are truly the Nelson Nelson 
Mandela of wiping,

1820
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:32,420
and I feel as if I am not the only 
person to be converted by your wisdom.

1821
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:34,123
I had doubts about this technique for a 
decade and I can only think about all 

1822
01:35:38,391 --> 01:35:41,300
the wasted time I've spent using an 
insufficient,

1823
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:42,583
inefficient wiping motion.
I recommend all back wipers give it one 

1824
01:35:47,031 --> 01:35:52,031
week trial because the result is truly 
life changing.

1825
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:57,230
Thank you're sincerely.
10:00

1826
01:35:57,230 --> 01:35:58,063
PM I do not use baby wipes.
I've heard nothing but horror stories 

1827
01:36:02,001 --> 01:36:03,000
about the dam.
Okay,

1828
01:36:03,001 --> 01:36:03,834
and now,
Yay.

1829
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:06,890
You had me until you started talking 
shit on baby wipes,

1830
01:36:06,891 --> 01:36:10,100
Daniel.
But you know I really wonderful.

1831
01:36:10,101 --> 01:36:10,934
I think I was moved because I was never 
my intention to convert anyone ever 

1832
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:21,500
thought it was my,
as a misunderstood soul,

1833
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:22,423
a victim of my own excess of wiping.
But I hope that it doesn't switch back 

1834
01:36:28,231 --> 01:36:33,231
once he understands that it doesn't need
to stand up to wipe from the Mac did.

1835
01:36:34,231 --> 01:36:36,480
It's been wiping his ass his whole life.
He knows what he's doing.

1836
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,320
Um,
interestingly,

1837
01:36:40,321 --> 01:36:44,100
Zack,
I just heard our sound guy,

1838
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:47,160
he's our sound intern.
He's helping us out with sound.

1839
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:51,600
Um,
he told me today that he in his house,

1840
01:36:51,601 --> 01:36:55,260
they don't even have toilet paper.
They go pure wet wipe,

1841
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:58,470
which I've never thin.
I've never seen that.

1842
01:36:58,770 --> 01:37:01,950
And frankly I find it a little strange 
because I would never,

1843
01:37:01,951 --> 01:37:06,951
I would never recommend a start wet 
because that's just asking for trouble.

1844
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:11,370
I recommend to Zach and to all anyone 
else out there,

1845
01:37:11,371 --> 01:37:15,210
you have to take a hybrid approach 
because you want to start try and what?

1846
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:17,340
So Zach,
welcome aboard.

1847
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,360
Pretty strange.
Zach,

1848
01:37:21,361 --> 01:37:26,361
do you wipe from the front or the back?
Can you talk into the mic method?

1849
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:30,420
You serious?
Whoa.

1850
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:31,583
First I was doing before,
but I tried it out and I happen to 

1851
01:37:34,321 --> 01:37:35,250
really like it.
Wait,

1852
01:37:35,251 --> 01:37:36,084
are you fucking kidding me?
You're just saying that you want me to 

1853
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:43,350
bend over and yeah,
I don't know what that would prove.

1854
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:46,650
I'm a cleat.
Wait,

1855
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:47,460
wait,
Whoa,

1856
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:48,720
wait,
let me get this straight.

1857
01:37:48,721 --> 01:37:49,554
Zach,
are you just saying this to get the job 

1858
01:37:51,661 --> 01:37:55,050
right here or something?
He wouldn't lie about this.

1859
01:37:55,850 --> 01:37:57,350
He wouldn't lie about this.
He'll,

1860
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,520
that's embarrassing.
It is very embarrassing.

1861
01:37:59,521 --> 01:38:02,580
But baby wipes and let me tell you,
save your life.

1862
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:03,361
Hold on,
hold on.

1863
01:38:03,361 --> 01:38:04,111
Hold on.
Backup,

1864
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:04,944
backup,
backup,

1865
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:06,143
backup.
Hang on.

1866
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:07,403
You're telling me that you wiped from 
the bat until you heard this show and 

1867
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:12,204
then based on my anecdote,
you decided to lift your own balls and 

1868
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:19,620
Dick and one hand reach under them and 
scoop out the shit from the front.

1869
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:23,580
100% I cannot remember.
And you prefer it?

1870
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:24,780
I do prefer,
yes.

1871
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:33,330
Wait and wait.
And Ian is a front in.

1872
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:34,820
I don't know that we've ever asked you 
and where,

1873
01:38:34,821 --> 01:38:38,070
where do you wipe from it?
I think we did from the front seat.

1874
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:41,670
And then then you're in back white boy.
Hold on.

1875
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,430
Wait,
Dan is the odd man out here for one.

1876
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:48,030
And then have you always wiped from the 
front?

1877
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:50,760
No,
I converted probably a high school.

1878
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:53,250
Oh,
why did you convert?

1879
01:38:53,251 --> 01:38:56,550
What makes you say to yourself in the 
middle of your life that you're going to

1880
01:38:56,551 --> 01:38:59,700
start lifting up your dick and balls and
scooping out shit from underneath it?

1881
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:00,953
I didn't know that that was possible.
And then I think someone in a show set 

1882
01:39:04,861 --> 01:39:05,880
it and I went,
what?

1883
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:09,510
That's madness.
I tried it and I never went back.

1884
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:13,690
And you think it's superior?
Absolutely bogus.

1885
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:18,570
Truly a profit.
I'd been saying,

1886
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:21,320
have you tried it now?
They know I did.

1887
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:22,261
Yes.
No,

1888
01:39:22,261 --> 01:39:24,870
I gave it.
I gave it an honest go coop.

1889
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:28,100
No,
there was some stupid,

1890
01:39:28,370 --> 01:39:28,950
I mean,
no,

1891
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:29,783
I,
I,

1892
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:31,740
I,
I want it to be objective.

1893
01:39:31,741 --> 01:39:32,570
You know,
I am like,

1894
01:39:32,570 --> 01:39:33,690
it.
Go into it without bias.

1895
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:34,620
Didn't like it.
Didn't like it.

1896
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:35,483
Now Dan,
tell me what you were sitting on the 

1897
01:39:36,331 --> 01:39:37,710
John,
right.

1898
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:41,520
And generally where I did my business,
but I just want to make sure you did the

1899
01:39:41,521 --> 01:39:43,120
technique right.
And then what?

1900
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:45,270
Which hand did you wipe with?
Oh,

1901
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:46,390
well I'm a righty.
So with the,

1902
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:48,540
you lifted your balls and deck with your
left hand,

1903
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:53,250
you remained seated a yes.
And then you went in with the right hand

1904
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:55,890
in under underhanded,
underhanded technique.

1905
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:56,910
Yeah,
that's how you do it.

1906
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:58,290
I know,
I think I nailed it.

1907
01:39:58,290 --> 01:39:59,850
I think I nailed the technique and then 
just,

1908
01:39:59,851 --> 01:40:03,960
I'm not a fan.
You may need to try it to the group mix.

1909
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:07,680
Make an egg in there.
I'm down for that for sure.

1910
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:09,330
Chuck.
Chris.

1911
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:10,950
Well,
I have to tell you,

1912
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,710
this was an eye opening.
This whole saga,

1913
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:17,520
not only with sac,
a recent convert at that Ian Independent

1914
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:19,440
and Ian,
he's a talented young man.

1915
01:40:19,441 --> 01:40:20,274
He'd say,
tell he's got a good head on his 

1916
01:40:20,761 --> 01:40:23,130
shoulders and high school.
He said to himself,

1917
01:40:23,131 --> 01:40:23,964
there's gotta be a better way.
And he was converted from that first 

1918
01:40:26,401 --> 01:40:27,750
scoop.
And I find that powerful.

1919
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:30,750
We just found out two conversions in one
week.

1920
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:34,790
Wow.
Who says he's amazing work here.

1921
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:39,690
Important word,
incredible stuff.

1922
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:44,340
And I thought that we were just talking 
here,

1923
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,630
wasting everyone's time.
No evil.

1924
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:49,020
How many people are going to front scoop
tonight?

1925
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,470
Let us know.
Send us an email,

1926
01:40:52,471 --> 01:40:55,270
send us your thoughts podcast,
we productions.com.

1927
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:56,300
All right,
well,

1928
01:40:56,301 --> 01:40:57,970
uh,
today is Friday.

1929
01:40:57,971 --> 01:41:00,130
We've got,
oh KSI on Tuesday.

1930
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:04,040
It'll be exciting.
We'll go to lots of tall.

1931
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,480
No we didn't.
So case size on Tuesday.

1932
01:41:07,481 --> 01:41:10,720
That's our episode next week.
I'm working on the h three video.

1933
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:13,150
Hopefully will be out this weekend.
I don't know.

1934
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:15,730
Who knows?
We'll see.

1935
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:20,350
I'll do my best with that all being 
said.

1936
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,620
How'd we do today?
We did solid.

1937
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:27,453
However the numbers chuckles back here.
I think the numbers are low because I 

1938
01:41:31,901 --> 01:41:35,130
heard people say it wasn't showing up.
Yeah.

1939
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:37,180
I apologize to anybody that didn't get 
the notification.

1940
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:39,660
I mean eyes that I got it on my phone.
Um,

1941
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:40,533
but yeah,
I guess in the tweet I saw some 

1942
01:41:41,951 --> 01:41:44,890
responses that people were having 
trouble finding the episode today.

1943
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:46,510
So we will,
we will investigate,

1944
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:49,480
maybe emailed the,
our context that,

1945
01:41:49,481 --> 01:41:52,090
um,
even when I went to our podcast channel,

1946
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:52,973
you know,
we'll usually show there and doing the 

1947
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:55,870
show.
I have to click on the video.

1948
01:41:56,040 --> 01:42:00,340
Lee,
what the hell you to,

1949
01:42:00,341 --> 01:42:02,650
enough people found that cause we're at 
like 17,000

1950
01:42:02,651 --> 01:42:04,210
now.
Ultimately it did well.

1951
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:05,073
But,
um,

1952
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:06,460
but yeah,
anybody that,

1953
01:42:06,461 --> 01:42:07,294
uh,
I got screwed by that and we apologize 

1954
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:09,184
to find that strange.
I wonder if there's a thing in the 

1955
01:42:11,141 --> 01:42:15,250
settings we fucked up or not likely just
say youtube bug.

1956
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:16,750
I think it's gotta be,
cause again,

1957
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:19,260
I did get it.
I mean I got all the notes.

1958
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:21,670
Look and we have a contact.
We can email it.

1959
01:42:21,671 --> 01:42:22,390
Youtube,
right?

1960
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:22,901
Yeah.
Yeah.

1961
01:42:22,901 --> 01:42:23,681
We'll,
we'll reach out.

1962
01:42:23,681 --> 01:42:26,380
We'll figure out what happened.
Oh Man.

1963
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:27,573
You gotta Love Youtube.
It's like never know what you're going 

1964
01:42:29,131 --> 01:42:29,964
to get.
Imagine being like NBC and you're like 

1965
01:42:33,761 --> 01:42:34,594
new episode of Seinfeld.
Maybe half of the People's TV's don't 

1966
01:42:37,781 --> 01:42:38,614
turn on half a half of everybody just 
gets scrambled waves when they turn on 

1967
01:42:42,761 --> 01:42:47,761
NBC imagined.
All right guys.

1968
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:51,563
Have a great weekend.
The morals of bad science Tuesday and 

1969
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,390

1974
01:43:12,461 --> 01:43:13,630

1975
