1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,630
Welcome.

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,053
Everybody did the h three podcasts.
We are sponsored by me on these stitch 

3
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:18,900
fix and Felix Gray.
The guest is the Hilarious,

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,960
the wonderful,
the excellent machine,

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,760
otherwise known as Berg pricer.
Everyone's like,

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,810
all right.
The new Netflix special out today,

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,510
secret time,
which I've watched.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,650
Loved.
Hilarious.

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,020
So good.
You have to watch it,

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:39,050
but after this podcast,
because I want you,

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,253
I want you to,

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,061
that's fair.
Yeah,

13
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:41,670
yeah,
yeah.

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,610
You're the first person I ever send a 
special to ever in my entire life.

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,860
Yup.
By the way,

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,440
that this isn't right machine.
It was,

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,050
well,
it was,

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,220
must have been three years ago.
Was it three years ago?

19
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:54,520
It was like one year.
No,

20
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:54,811
no,
no.

21
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:56,670
It had to be loved when you were in here
for,

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,050
oh,
when I did the machine,

23
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:02,160
when I read the machine does it had to 
be excited to maybe two,

24
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:03,420
maybe two.
A five.

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,940
Okay.
Let's say five ban all about hyperbole.

26
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,350
It was like 20 years ago,
right?

27
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:08,430
Yeah,
he was before the Internet.

28
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:09,790
That's what's really impressive about 
law.

29
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,730
I was following you and I was,
I was like obsessed with you,

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,740
and then I kept tweeting your videos and
then you were like,

31
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,603
Hey,
oh,

32
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,540
thank you,
or whatever,

33
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,740
and I was like,
I was like,

34
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:23,251
yeah,
and you're like,

35
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:23,990
do you have a new specialist?

36
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,190
Like let me send it to you.
I'd never done that to anyone.

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,950
And it's such an uncomfortable place to 
go to to go like,

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,360
hey,
here's what I've been working on.

39
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,440
Yeah,
tell me if you enjoy it.

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,610
And I was like,
wait,

41
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:35,430
that was a big fucking mistake.
I should've let him found me online.

42
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,140
The good stuff first.
And then I was like,

43
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:39,060
oh shit.
And then you came back,

44
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:40,260
you were like,
that was hilarious.

45
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,760
Hey Randy,
moving out to la,

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,410
come do my podcast.
And I was like,

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,030
oh my God.
I was like,

48
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:49,910
you're coming up to La Mama podcast,
her left eye.

49
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,310
Then the sad part is,
is that we had you on,

50
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,940
we had this one are probably the best 
episodes,

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,340
probably the first guy here in this 
office.

52
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,640
We had just got this studio.
We had just built this big beautiful set

53
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,980
or like let's bring Burton.

54
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,820
He's always honored guests.
It was such a great,

55
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,600
I was flipping the table.
I remember you flipped the table.

56
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,763
We were drunk.
We were drunk when I left here and you 

57
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:14,850
said to me when you started,
you go,

58
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:19,851
I don't really drink by the first break,
like in 30 minutes we were drunk.

59
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,330
I was flipping the table.
Everybody was the best episode I've ever

60
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:25,164
said.
I can say that without reserve because 

61
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,510
no one will ever see it.
No one will ever,

62
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,213
and it's such a shame because it was 
lost to oblivion for technical issues 

63
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,740
at,
because we were new.

64
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:38,310
We didn't know we were doing and I'm so,
so sorry that that happened.

65
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,413
I'm so sorry.
But I will say we learned a lot of 

66
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:41,904
things from that episode.
We learned a lot from meeting gayle and 

67
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:47,880
having you on and I want to list some of
the things we learned from it if I can.

68
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,830
Yes.
First of all,

69
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:50,664
to your great credit we,
it was like three hours of shooting and 

70
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:55,920
you said you have to post the whole 
thing on edited.

71
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,610
That was like November.
You were like,

72
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,290
and you were like,
you were cutting.

73
00:02:59,291 --> 00:02:59,970
You were like,
all right,

74
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,210
cut.
And then I was like,

75
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:01,451
no,
no,

76
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:02,530
no,
just rolled his whole thing.

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,210
I can't believe we have done that.
We were thinking,

78
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,930
because we were still thinking like 
youtube video.

79
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,080
You were definitely thinking youtube 
video and thinking like you're like,

80
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,460
we got to chop it up.
And I was like,

81
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:12,731
no,
no,

82
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:13,050
no,
no,

83
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,000
no.
And I kept saying the beautiful stuff is

84
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:18,490
the in between stuff.
It's like I love,

85
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,473
my favorite part of podcasting is when 
like something happens off mic and 

86
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:24,500
you're listening and you're like,
well,

87
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,740
what's going on over there?
Favorite part.

88
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,120
We were so obsessed with cutting it and 
editing it down.

89
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,830
It's true that it loses authenticity.
It loses the pop.

90
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,293
And when you're in the editing and 
you're trying to edit down like a 

91
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,880
natural conversation,
it's like mad at me.

92
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,110
What do you,
you know what I'm saying?

93
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,190
Yeah.
So you were right.

94
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,413
Oh,
okay.

95
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,573
Right,
right.

96
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,040
And we always thought,
because it took us a while to get there,

97
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,990
but we stopped editing.
We said Bert was right.

98
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,610
Yep.
Um,

99
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,750
number two,
I remember we don't get,

100
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,770
we get uber blocks for all of our guests
now.

101
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,980
Oh my God,
we forgot about that.

102
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,750
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

103
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:20,041
I remember that.
I did at the time I didn't even,

104
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:20,974
I understood there was uber,
but I didn't know anyone used anything 

105
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:25,360
other than uber black and your life.
And I was like,

106
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:26,410
I want to be drinking.
I'll get an uber.

107
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:26,951
And you were like,
no,

108
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:27,401
no,
no.

109
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,234
I insist

110
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,790
wasn't a carb,
but it may have been.

111
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,580
I totally forgot that.
Let us get you an uber home.

112
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:57,921
I was like,
no,

113
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:58,754
no,
I didn't know that there was another 

114
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,700
option.
So I was on the other end,

115
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,400
but I remember we were,
when he was trying to pick you up,

116
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,080
he couldn't find deals.
You're on the phone.

117
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:10,960
He didn't speak English,
but he's on the corner.

118
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:12,820
He's a big guy.
He's got a beard.

119
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,460
I wouldn't get in his back seat.
And her groceries back there.

120
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:17,110
I was like,
oh,

121
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,090
oh.
So since that moment I was again,

122
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:25,040
I want you to know we get blacks for all
of our guests.

123
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,570
And ever since that day we sprung for 
the black.

124
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,463
I didn't and I liked,
I liked my uber's just like I like my 

125
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:36,421
men black xl.
That's a great line.

126
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,750
So Uber's blacks and excellent.
So again,

127
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,490
giving honor to you.
Totally forgot about that.

128
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,563
And so third and most importantly,
which we have not forgotten and I shall 

129
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,800
never forget by far the most

130
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,220
as you may now understand as I pull it 
up,

131
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,700
what is this?
What is this?

132
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,260
Oh,
I know what it is immediately.

133
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,870
I know exactly what this is.
Quicksand porn.

134
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,693
Oh,
something came up when we were having 

135
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:15,704
our last conversation.
It's the one really sticks out is we 

136
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,590
were talking about all the weird shit we
find on youtube and you were like,

137
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm into this thing quicksand.
And I was like,

138
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,200
Whoa,
what is that?

139
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,910
So and then,
well I'm so happy that kind of,

140
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,753
we get a chance to Redo this because I 
got the opportunity to look it up and 

141
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,010
now we can have the pleasure of watching
it together.

142
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,033
Yeah,
please.

143
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,120
I know this one,
you're familiar with this.

144
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,170
Well there's only like 30 out there.
They're pretty niche prize.

145
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,060
How did you find quick sand porn?
I don't think,

146
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,920
I think I first heard about it.

147
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,753
I'm like a radio lab and they were like,
and they were talking about quicksand 

148
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:55,400
porn and I was like,
what's so interesting?

149
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,530
I used to have a joke about like the 
premise was I always thought by this age

150
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:01,364
I would have been trapped in quick sand 
a couple of times by now cause growing 

151
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:04,724
up quick,
Sam was like everywhere and now they're 

152
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:07,214
just to put this out there.
There is a comedian who has a joke like 

153
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,930
that.
I never really told mine when I told him

154
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,090
like,
but in bags,

155
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,900
the only person who ever heard it in 
bag,

156
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,750
hilarious comedian one time said the 
best quicksand joke ever.

157
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,210
He walked into my hat was on the floor 
and he walked.

158
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:20,930
Anyone?
Huh?

159
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,860
Quicksand got him?
Huh?

160
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,360
It was just a great one.
That's pretty quick.

161
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,240
Quicksand was in everything I ever spoke
growing up.

162
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,600
I haven't Costello,
uh,

163
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,660
uh,
every like every,

164
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,040
uh,
everything was,

165
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,780
quicksand was always the Damsel in 
quicksand.

166
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,063
Oh,
and I had an obsession with this is a 

167
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,160
young man's fetish.
No,

168
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:37,461
no,
no,

169
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:38,930
no.
It's like you gotta be like 45.

170
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,880
Okay.
I explained cause I was like,

171
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:41,714
how did you come out?
Like how do people come up with that 

172
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,650
issue?
Bring it cross?

173
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,510
Oh No,
no,

174
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,343
chill.
It's based in like the same shit that 

175
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:49,754
like there was a TV show called the 
Boogaloos when I was a kid and like 

176
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,230
every episode they tied up the girl.
So I remember going to this,

177
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:59,780
I was a dominatrix skim for a day on 
this old show I had.

178
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,490
And uh,
the conquer,

179
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,980
no,
no hurt Bert.

180
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:03,950
Oh,
heard burt.

181
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,570
And so I was a dominatrix,
kept with this lady,

182
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:08,090
Mistress Isabella.
And she did a bunch of stuff to me.

183
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,380
And at the end of the day I was like,
I was like,

184
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:11,330
you know,
I gotta be honest with you.

185
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,490
Not a lot of it.
I didn't find sexy at all,

186
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:16,160
but there was a couple things where I 
found like really hard.

187
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:16,994
She goes,
how old are you?

188
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,690
I was like ours at the time.
I must have been like 30 maybe.

189
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,670
And she was like,
check out this video.

190
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,060
And it was all stuff dialed into my sec.
Like the stuff that would have been,

191
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,380
he knows formative.
Yeah.

192
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,290
What was the stuff?
It was like super woman apple outfits.

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,460
Wonder what Jude,
when I first saw wonder woman,

194
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,280
I remember being a kid and I was like,
I was like,

195
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,143
oh,
I'm straight.

196
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,610
I didn't know what that was,
but I was like,

197
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:43,470
whatever that is.
Like the other day we were in a,

198
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:44,304
we were in hot topic,
my daughters are into that kind of like 

199
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,610
anime stuff and there was a wonder woman
bathing suit.

200
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,540
Right.
And I was like,

201
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,403
I was like,
honey,

202
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
let's get this for you.
And she was like,

203
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,100
it's made for girls.
Like,

204
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,010
I'm a like

205
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,630
a 48 year old woman,
I'm going to look disgusting.

206
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:59,190
And I was like,
that'd be your what I got.

207
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,390
But so yeah,
so quicksand was like the thing.

208
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,253
And then I watched the thing,
I listen to the and rate lab and then I 

209
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,860
start going,
I can't be a real thing.

210
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:08,990
It's gotta be a joke.
All right.

211
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,970
And then I googled it one night and it 
was just the,

212
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,690
it was like a weird,
like it's not,

213
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,583
I don't know,
it's just like something that I was 

214
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:18,330
like,
that's kind of sexy.

215
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,253
The point when the girl's boobs get to 
the mud reminded me of like every time 

216
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:22,824
the dams will,
we get to the mud and her boobs would 

217
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,010
lift naturally.
You'd go as a kid,

218
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:27,000
you'd be like,
oh my God.

219
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,460
Oh my God.
What happened in mad?

220
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,810
It just connected with that.
Yeah.

221
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,511
Well,
okay.

222
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:37,770
So the thing that really threw me off at
this is that like a lot of them,

223
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:38,604
the girl,
she like dies and the end like the 

224
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:42,990
fetish,
like she straight up,

225
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,640
she just disappears into the oblivion 
and they,

226
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,900
and they hold that shot for a while.
He didn't worry.

227
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,910
Do I go how long she been under and 
weight and like legit like dude,

228
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:58,050
I've seen some really weird ones.
Like we're that like these,

229
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,333
now that I said it out loud,
what happens is all these dudes that 

230
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,830
make him hit me up and the like,
hey man,

231
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:06,030
check out my quicksand videos.
Oh you got hit up community.

232
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,800
Oh,
quit by sinkers.

233
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:10,320
They're called sinkers.
They're bold thinkers.

234
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,193
Yeah.
There's like a legit community of 

235
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,690
people.
They're all older gentlemen.

236
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,470
Yeah,
no,

237
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,770
a lot of young kids thinking these days.
Yeah.

238
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,130
Maybe today maybe we can change that.
Yeah.

239
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,983
Maybe we can introduce this to everyone.
I want it to keep the infuse some new 

240
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,450
blood into this community.
It's,

241
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,720
it's uh,
no,

242
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,580
I don't think so.
I like 20 years olds going,

243
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,620
what the fuck?
Well,

244
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,080
here we go.
I've got a whole,

245
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,070
I mean,
I've got awesome.

246
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,120
If you have the good one,
I'll show.

247
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,440
I'll tell you which ones that go down 
here.

248
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,820
Let me see.
21 minutes of it.

249
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,230
While here,
I'm going to skip forward a sexy girl.

250
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,480
Aw Man.
I don't know what I'm a,

251
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,820
that's,
that top is troubling.

252
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,190
Lay Low for this.
A family friendly show.

253
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,601
Let's cut.
Oh,

254
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:00,230
this one's good.
This one is quite graphics.

255
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,710
I don't want to get to when she's in a 
bathing suit for Christ sake.

256
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,650
I mean,
give me a break,

257
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:05,161
right?
I mean,

258
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,380
what do we fucking,
what is just the Catholic Church?

259
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,243
Oh,
look at the,

260
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,450
I'm trying to not show too much.
I don't want to cut.

261
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,970
I want to cut to the money shot,
Aka when she dies.

262
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,910
I don't Dunno.
Does she perished in this one?

263
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,020
This shit is so bizarre.
It's so bizarre.

264
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:25,854
Probably the way this can you sit back?
But I don't think she parishes in this 

265
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:31,141
one.
So let's,

266
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:31,974
let's,
um,

267
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,000
look at this as the birds.
That's real.

268
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,103
So here we go.
So this is the one where they perish at 

269
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,200
the end.
And these are,

270
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,370
these are the ones that I cherish here.
She is a star.

271
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,690
It's almost like a thrasher.
Oh,

272
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:47,520
see this is good.
She's walking through the woods.

273
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,870
Yeah.
You get the whole story.

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,410
Yeah.
She's running away from someone.

275
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,953
Oh Wow.
What is this apocalypto or you out of 

276
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:01,114
your mind that is tar.
You had two very good ways to walk 

277
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,360
around that.
This one was,

278
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,220
she likes it and there's one where she's
actually like,

279
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,570
yeah,
I think this one was shoes.

280
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,670
She's going quick.
Well,

281
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,870
she's like,
I'm dying somebody.

282
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,360
Maybe this is not a joke.
Yeah.

283
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,383
She's like,
I know.

284
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,990
I know you're filming.
Yeah,

285
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,830
there we go.
This is going to get really sex.

286
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,664
You know?

287
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,410
Oh well your hair back.
She,

288
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,933
I can't see the fricking barba.
I want to find the money shot where she 

289
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:42,140
pairs.
She's struggling,

290
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:43,640
man.
So here we go.

291
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,220
She looks a little bit like,
Ugh,

292
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,820
get your Dick Style.
Everybody.

293
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,470
By the way,
this isn't the park.

294
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,710
I've already stopped watching it for the
record.

295
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,480
He's got a watch her breaking character.
It'd be like Darryl for real.

296
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,650
Come on money anymore,
man.

297
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,650
That's what really turns me on when they
instruct them to break the wall.

298
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:16,790
So it looks like they're actually done.

299
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,783
See Ya.

300
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,670
By the way,
it should be noted.

301
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,080
She didn't even take a breath.
Now let's see.

302
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,070
Oh,
like can I tell you what's crazy is that

303
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,280
this got me into a spiral.
The quicksand and there's a video online

304
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,383
of this,
uh,

305
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,313
I think he's like a brittle British 
journalist where quicksand is out in 

306
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:40,690
like the aisles,
like somewhere close.

307
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,910
And he's like,
he's like,

308
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,190
all right.
So the quick son,

309
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,024
he is pretty dangerous.
And what I'm going to do is I'm going 

310
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:47,794
to,
I'm going to demonstrate how you get in 

311
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,350
and out of quick sand.
I've got all of the safety guards,

312
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,330
we're going to be fine.
So first of all,

313
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,740
you get in,
you wiggle around a little bit,

314
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,330
all right?
And then you go in a little lower.

315
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,223
While this was happening quick,
does that mean a lot quicker than I 

316
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:58,054
thought?
All right.

317
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,403
All right,
maybe we want to start getting me out 

318
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,240
and they spend three hours trying to get
them out of quick.

319
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,890
You,
he is terrified.

320
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:09,490
And he was thinking and how high up does
it go?

321
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,280
I can't,
I honestly think it gets to his chest,

322
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,790
but he can't breathe and he's like 
having,

323
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,630
and I'm watching this,
I'm watching it like,

324
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,000
you know there's Russian kids that hang 
off the side of a building.

325
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,610
Yeah Dude,
I'm watching it like that going like I'm

326
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,680
going,
it's long usually by no he doesn't die.

327
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,360
He's like holy.
I started doing,

328
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,170
I started doing a solo podcast because 
of videos like that where I do too.

329
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,004
I do one with like,
but the open tabs open and I just do 

330
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:40,000
open tabs of shit.
I like of like shit I'm interested in.

331
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,950
It's always flash floods but like,
but like I,

332
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,260
that kind of stuff blows my mind.
Like when you find a video like that and

333
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,460
you're like,
oh no,

334
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:52,190
I mean I love that open tabs right away 
cause I always like a million.

335
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,030
Yeah.
So it's a fun,

336
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,393
it's a fun game that we used to play.
I used to play with guys is like you'd 

337
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,980
go in and just open your browser like 
this and grow.

338
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,300
Go ahead.
Ask me what I've been googling.

339
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,400
Someone could just flip through and be 
like,

340
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,400
oh,
tell me about Kevin and being,

341
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,250
I go,
oh well beans,

342
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,960
the guy that's not,
you're not in studio.

343
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,070
Oh,
tell me about rich Eisen.

344
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,143
Oh,
tell me about,

345
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,773
all right,
so,

346
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,631
right.
But yeah,

347
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:20,450
so that's the podcast.
But I love finding a good video on,

348
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,500
I never imagined in my whole life that 
I,

349
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:26,390
and I feel like I've seen everything.
So I'm wondering,

350
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,253
do you have any other strange,
bizarre phenomenon is that you're on to 

351
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:32,600
youtube right now that's really piquing 
your interest or your penis?

352
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,970
Oh Dude,
I'm old.

353
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,023
Can I tell you the cool,
one of the coolest things I've seen at 

354
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:37,814
all?
Do you ever heard backdoor cow backroom 

355
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,670
casting couch?
That's a porn,

356
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:41,504
right?
Yeah.

357
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,660
I saw one of the outtakes where the girl
says no.

358
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,180
Oh,
then it was so awesome.

359
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,540
Wait,
that's not,

360
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,650
that's the owner is,
that's not the point.

361
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,980
Nothing happens,
but it's so awesome.

362
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,353
Why are you here?
She just sits down and he does his 

363
00:15:58,911 --> 00:15:59,421
spiel.
This,

364
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:01,190
you've heard the spiel.
So I'm a,

365
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,230
I'm not the director of myself 
personally,

366
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:05,830
I'm just a casting guy.
I send this out to the producers,

367
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,673
they'll hire you and they just want to 
make sure he can form a camera and that 

368
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:09,524
you're comfortable.
She's like,

369
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,611
yeah.
He's like,

370
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:13,220
so what I'm gonna ask you to do is first
undress.

371
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,083
And then the best part of that whole 
video series is that look on their face 

372
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:17,714
where they're like,

373
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,270
okay,
that's the only reason I've ever watched

374
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,300
it.
And the one girl goes and he's like,

375
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:25,400
what?
She's like,

376
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,030
pay me now.
And he was like that.

377
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,070
And then you see him on his heels,
like,

378
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,620
that's not how it works.
Um,

379
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,793
she switched it on and this guy who has 
been so competent for the old series is 

380
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:36,721
like,
no,

381
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:41,030
you got to get engine ever go anywhere.
No,

382
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,450
they never go anywhere.
It's so great.

383
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,550
I was like,
more of them.

384
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,180
I just,
I think on youtube too,

385
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,400
a backroom casting couch fail or 
something fail.

386
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,510
Oh,
it's on pornhub better not click.

387
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,550
Yeah.
Tony Robbins.

388
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,570
I can watch any video he does because he
is a sociopath.

389
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,870
Tony Robbins freaks me out because on 
one hand like he,

390
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:06,040
I get it.
Yeah,

391
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,230
I've heard him.
He's got like this magic.

392
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:09,730
He's like,
he is a sociopath.

393
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,570
He's got that charm.
He's a,

394
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,263
he could make you eat poison apple sauce
and catch a fucking comment behind the 

395
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:17,584
moon or whatever.
He could do that 100% he's got to be 

396
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:21,954
scary.
He's got a video of him showing off his 

397
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:24,184
house in Fiji.
Right and he's showing it to the camera 

398
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,573
and it's just like,
do you ever like the best way to say 

399
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:32,344
this is like,
do you ever have a friend who gets 

400
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:36,880
genital warts?
Then every conversation they have,

401
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,760
all they do is kind of slide in 
statistics about how common general

402
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,270
told you the day of genital warts are.
Just like you don't want to force people

403
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,240
have HPV.
HPV is very common.

404
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,223
Very,
very common.

405
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,083
Wait,
wait.

406
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,490
He is an interesting,

407
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,720
I go to the very end and watch the way 
he makes going on.

408
00:17:54,721 --> 00:17:57,990
I can't see it for some reason.
I'm not ready.

409
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:00,700
But you was covering the,
let me try to address that.

410
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,553
Okay.
What?

411
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,350
He's right here.
I'm,

412
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,100
I'll tell you,
I can remember.

413
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,973
He's basically saying it's got heart.
It's a very integral part of this 

414
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:08,370
community.
That's really his family.

415
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:09,204
They call him big boss,
but this is what a family who calls him 

416
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:16,770
big boss.
Everyone calls him big pause.

417
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,470
Everyone that children called him big 
box.

418
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,150
Oh Tony,
that's fucked up.

419
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,260
But the best part is he forces everyone 
to stop what they're doing.

420
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,333
Come out to the driveway and sing a song
to him and he stands in the middle as 

421
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:33,180
they sing at him and play the guitar and
you look at some guys like,

422
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,770
I've got to get back to cutting trees.

423
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,151
Okay,
Tony,

424
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:36,984
let's do this.
You just play a little bit and you'll 

425
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:41,430
see them sitting into apples though.
He's in great shape.

426
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,833
By the way,
I'm answering all this and I understand 

427
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,190
that he's never sold himself as anything
other than what he is.

428
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,200
Okay,
well,

429
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,210
being hypocritical is out.
We watched the documentary lugs.

430
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,283
It's pretty incredible.
The thing is like there's a documentary 

431
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:59,730
on Netflix about him that was a definite
puff piece,

432
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,490
but you can't help but aside the 
insanity of it.

433
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,550
So as hard as they try to make him look 
like a saint,

434
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,590
you can tell how weird it is also.
Oh,

435
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,091
he's good.
Right?

436
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:11,180
Dipping pool outside his house.
Paul,

437
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,333
he's got a little,
he's got a little trampoline that he 

438
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:14,300
hops on.
Yeah,

439
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,560
he makes the girl break up with her 
boyfriend on the phone.

440
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,293
I was like,
dude,

441
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,270
hey,
what's,

442
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,000
what's life going to be like when she 
gets out of here?

443
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:24,690
I'm to get that roller and he calls 
back.

444
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:25,650
He's like,
what the fuck was that?

445
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,461
And she's like,
sorry,

446
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:27,330
we're okay.
Sorry.

447
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,720
I just got peer pressured into doing it 
on live TV.

448
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,110
I didn't mean that at all.

449
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,440
He's like,
he does this shit where it's like,

450
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,630
it's pretty broken afterwards.
Fuck.

451
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:44,140
That part fucked me up.
I was like,

452
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,060
that wasn't cool at Tony Robbins,
but it's like he does this.

453
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,190
He's like,
you know,

454
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:51,360
he's not good for you.
Right.

455
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,360
So you're going to call him right now 
while everyone's watching.

456
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:59,361
The camera's on you and tell them you 
don't love him and you never lie and you

457
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,850
never loved it.
It was like,

458
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:03,960
Whoa,
he does that for me.

459
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:04,794
I go and buy here.
Here's the biggest problem is like I 

460
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:09,870
know self help gurus like I know them 
and I just go,

461
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,273
what?
What about the day before you were sell 

462
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,670
Po ruin?
You were looking for help like yeah,

463
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,830
I just know they're walking paradox and 
you know this guy's the most fuck.

464
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,860
I mean if this guy,
he's got a fuck dungeon,

465
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,770
he's got,
there's he,

466
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,970
he has like nine different beds around 
his house and he just keeps going.

467
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:32,670
This was my old ward bed where my 
beautiful wife and I are low.

468
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,870
Okay.
My beautiful wife.

469
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,263
Okay.
Your wife like tell me this is where we 

470
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,574
make love.

471
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,790
No,
this guy's crazy man.

472
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,130
It doesn't have like gigantism he's just
got,

473
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,790
he's got like a disease that makes him 
like huge and it's voice crazy.

474
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,820
We couldn't kill him if he was passed 
out in the hotel room with bats.

475
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,210
Okay.
He's not much bigger than no,

476
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,401
no.
He,

477
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:03,401
he has gigantic cism or things,
so he's a massive man whose teeth fit in

478
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:07,960
his mouth,
like he doesn't have his baby teeth.

479
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,273
Oh,
is that true?

480
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,040
Baby teeth when you're beginning is a 
hormone thing.

481
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,020
There's something wrong.
There's,

482
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,470
you know,
he's in great shape.

483
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:16,210
He's got to be on testosterone.
Yeah,

484
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:21,100
he's killing it.
Which means big boss.

485
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,280
His boss asked me about my family and 
then I'm going to reply the way.

486
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:29,230
Tony Robbins Fan.
Tell me about your family.

487
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,790
They call me big daddy Kane,
which means I'm the boss.

488
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,090
He laughs like it's like not his idea,
but they're like a dad.

489
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,140
He's like,
excuse me.

490
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,100
But he's like,
keep it going big.

491
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,953
You mean big daddy boss?
The way he just laughs at that was so 

492
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:48,160
creepy.
They call him big bosses.

493
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,730
I'm the big boss,
so when am I going to do paper?

494
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,070
Everything.
We've watched them sing to her.

495
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,411
I mean,
you know,

496
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:01,620
this guy's a god complex.
Gotcha.

497
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,100
Okay,
we'll be ready to go in five minutes.

498
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,510
These like,
dude,

499
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,220
I got shit to do.
He's like,

500
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,220
oh,
he's doing this.

501
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,710
I don't know.
I'm not comfortable with it.

502
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,990
Let's black face it up for him before he
gets out of here.

503
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,720
I don't know about this.
[inaudible]

504
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,630
big bosses.
Everyone kick your shoes off,

505
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,580
put on your Hawaiian shirts and they put
flowers in her hair.

506
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,500
So you think those guys had them in 
there naturally?

507
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,560
No Dick tire staff gathers to bid tony 
feel well just spontaneously but of love

508
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,150
and compassion Jews cause they're going 
to miss him.

509
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,140
They're going to mess cleaning up after 
him and taking care of them and take the

510
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,310
cards cause such a joy and a pleasure 
getting his breakfast ready.

511
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,610
Seeing that he only had half cause he's 
only watching silent.

512
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,030
The throwaway brand new way.
Don't fuck it.

513
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,060
Don't you eat that?
He goes,

514
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:03,040
don't you fucking eat that?
Throw in the garbage.

515
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,053
Total hypocrite.
Because this is exactly how I behave if 

516
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:06,454
I had this much money hiphugger because,
well he acts like he's Saint John The 

517
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:13,020
divine.
Yeah.

518
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,160
You know who look,
he's just like,

519
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:19,930
get me the fuck outta here.

520
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,270
Damn,
this is amazing.

521
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,770
Why did they even try to spin it like 
it's just coming back home.

522
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:29,040
See,
oh wait,

523
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,620
this is just his house.
This is just,

524
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,990
these mother fuckers just work at his 
house.

525
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,180
This isn't a resort.
This is your house.

526
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:35,830
These are your slaves.
He had slaves.

527
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,300
Yes.
Fiji slaves.

528
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,710
I think their employee meet out front.
Mr Tony Big Daddy's leaving 7:00

529
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,523
AM me there dress.
Bring your little up our fan and we've 

530
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:49,820
got a baby.
Hold up a baby in the shot.

531
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,163
You know what happens when you miss 7:00
AM they just spontaneously met on the 

532
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:56,720
driveway to say goodbye.

533
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,630
Why would you show this off?
This is embarrassing.

534
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:05,250
This is embarrassing.
This is embarrassing.

535
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,500
It's scary.
It's terrifying.

536
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Dj caught it in The Bahamas or resort 
there all the time.

537
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,840
This is his house.
He's probably their one month a year,

538
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,510
if a month.
I mean,

539
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:21,344
think of his schedule.
There's no way he's making it all the 

540
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,350
way to feed.
Do they have to pay per view?

541
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,220
I've watched this.
He's really in love with his wife.

542
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,510
No,
but it's not sex.

543
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,900
It's about I have to pay their tribute 
to the king.

544
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,760
Oh No.
You know back in the day the king got to

545
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:39,761
fuck the bride before the groom.
That's what's that called of fornication

546
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:43,430
under can send to the king fucking he's 
fornicating under the king.

547
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,500
Oh,
interesting.

548
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,590
By the way,
if we do get end up in a,

549
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,940
in a hate spiral in life,
Tony robins has never pulling us out.

550
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,350
We do need self help or they'll be like,
I'm glad you got there.

551
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,700
He's at boss is leaving.
Do you want to sing for me?

552
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,880
He's like,
maybe you luck if I fornicated with your

553
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:03,881
wife first.
Like shut up Tony.

554
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,480
She got you own slaves.
Beautiful,

555
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:11,314
beautiful.

556
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,610
They make them rehearse this.
These are just,

557
00:25:23,611 --> 00:25:25,990
these people are looking at your house 
and they were hurting songs.

558
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,800
The lyrics are never worked for him.
It was

559
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,300
really something,
man,

560
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:49,950
I'm glad you shared that you have are.
I have to stay.

561
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,900
You have gems.
You you bring gifts.

562
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,510
This is a gift.
I appreciate it.

563
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,043
I love this so much.
This is really the stuff that I live 

564
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:02,080
for.
Business insider.

565
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,943
They really cracked this store.
I mean he got in trouble recently for 

566
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:09,970
like a me too thing.
What was it like?

567
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,640
You said something at one of the 
conferences where,

568
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,910
what was it like in common?
It was like a victim shaming thing.

569
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,180
I'm not familiar because I'm not 
familiar with it.

570
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:20,014
Yeah,
that'd be here.

571
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,410
That would be the best thing.
Cause that's not misquote.

572
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,300
Let's keep totally,
no,

573
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,860
we do it.
Just go for Magid,

574
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:30,510
Lee.
I just start every state.

575
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,890
Allegedly,
I'll call the show allegedly.

576
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,710
So let's take a quick break and we'll 
come back.

577
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,120
Okay,
Tony,

578
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,580
you are not going to believe this 
footage of Tony Robbins.

579
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,010
He tude allegedly stay 10.

580
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,940
Do you know what I value as much as 
anything in this life?

581
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,580
What?
My Dick and my balls.

582
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,290
Okay.
You wear a nice shirt,

583
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,090
you wear nice pants,
you got to feel good in your clothing.

584
00:26:57,091 --> 00:26:57,924
Right?
So why is it that people think they can 

585
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:00,324
neglect underwear?
Why is it that when your dick and your 

586
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,240
balls are probably your most prized 
possession,

587
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,780
the calm,
the jewel's for a reason,

588
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,060
you just throw on in whatever you've 
got,

589
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,043
that's unacceptable.
And me undies knows exactly what I'm 

590
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:14,490
talking about.
That's why they make the softest,

591
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:15,324
most breathable and credible fabric with
book designs that are a total blast and 

592
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:25,191
a total breeze to were so comfortable,
so incredible.

593
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,060
Me undies.
Oh,

594
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:29,130
how comfortable can undies be Ethan?

595
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,190
Micro modal.
Do you understand how soft and luxurious

596
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:38,700
this is?
Balls and Dick need a place to live.

597
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,840
That's me on these creed.
That's her mission statement because the

598
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:45,870
ball's in the Dick Nita fomen.
Thank you.

599
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,860
Did I just sniff underwear?
They're cleaned by the way.

600
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:53,700
I'm like that.
Good.

601

Stitch fix is your virtual Ila.
Here's how it works.

628
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,703
You go on their website,
you answer a bunch of questions about 

629
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:34,110
your taste,
your budget,

630
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,620
all what kind of garments you like.
Look,

631
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
as I say,
garments now,

632
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,860
I own a clothing company.
I started saying garments,

633
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,273
you go,
you tell them everything about yourself 

634
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,660
and then all of a sudden they put 
together a wardrobe.

635
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,730
A stylist,
okay.

636
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,623
Someone with taste unlike you,
puts together a style for you in your 

637

638
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,040

You try it on,

639
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,150
you see if you like it,
guess what?

640
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,500
If you don't like it,
you send it back.

641
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,350
You don't have to pay for it.
It's convenient as it gets.

642
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,090
You've got someone with taste helping 
you out.

643
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:08,470
This is not your mom and your girlfriend
did.

644
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:12,370

658

We all spend a lot of time in front of 
screens.

659
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,520
That's just what we millennials do.
I was born with screens,

660
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,050
but now I'm finding out,
I read,

661
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:24,040
I heard this report just last week that 
the blue light emitted from screens.

662
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,330
Oh,
can cause strain.

663
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,930
It can mess with your vision.
Well now they think that it can actually

664
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:32,290
cause cancer and loss of vision at old 
age.

665
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,124
Are you freaking kidding me?
These blue lights need to get the frick 

666
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:38,260
out and that's what these Felix gray 
glasses are all about.

667
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,243
They have technology embedded in the 
lens to block those nasty blue lights 

668
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:47,140
from getting in those beautiful,
precious eyeballs of yours.

669
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,760
I do always feel like tired at the end 
of the day and like my eyes are tired.

670
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,713
It's the blue light.
They're like little isis particles and 

671
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:56,194
you're the free world.
Your eyes are the free world block him 

672
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,630
but up a wall.
That's what these glasses do.

673
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,500

676

this guy with gigantism talk express 

705
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:50,560

You know what,

706
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,250
at least these people are going into a 
stadium and saying,

707
00:33:53,251 --> 00:33:54,690
I'm broken.
Right.

708
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,760

what other stadiums fill up with people 
that are broken that don't,

00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:09,270
we're goofing on demand.
Tony Robbins.

716
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,160

to do for yourself to go there and 
learned about yourself.

719
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,470

00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,100
Oh shit.
And then shake night

751
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,070
comes out and fucking sets off of those.
A grenade in the audience.

752
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh,
all right.

753
00:35:43,001 --> 00:35:43,834
So we admitted these people,
it's good for them that they're going 

754
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:48,790
out and they're getting help.
God bless them and it's great to,

755
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:51,250
Tony can provide that kind of help for 
people.

756
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,340
But there's a big but but,
but

757
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,440
also,
well also,

758
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,090
well s and the slave thing like let's 
just say,

759
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,700
oh he's not that woke.
He's not that well yeah,

760
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,250
but he can say,
but you know,

761
00:36:03,251 --> 00:36:07,190
it's like these retreats,
they cost like $10,000

762
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,420
and people are like getting loans and 
selling their shit.

763
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,000
These are poor people that are looked,
are desperate,

764
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:14,990
you know,
to improve their lives.

765
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:15,711
I'm like,
Tony,

766
00:36:15,711 --> 00:36:17,340
you're a rich man.
And He,

767
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,360
what he would say is it's important to 
make that sacrifice so the experience is

768
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:23,504
more worth it for you.
It's easy for him to say when he's 

769
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:27,530
getting $10,000
hairs,

770
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,180
he would say the same thing but not 
important for you to maybe fire maybe 15

771
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,110
could we more look that up man,
man,

772
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,500
how much did it is?
10,000

773
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,860
Yup.
It's his business mastery.

774
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:44,330
I mean maybe he has different ones,
but that's the ultimate retreat.

775
00:36:44,331 --> 00:36:46,760
It's like a week long.
They even give you lunch.

776
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,210
They even give you lunches.
Well they give you a loan

777
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,470
lunches.
I better not.

778
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,263
I know,

779
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,110
but Tony would say the same thing.
He's like,

780
00:36:56,111 --> 00:36:58,150
listen,
if it's you're not paying me,

781
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,720
I need this shitty line.
Really not going to be worth my time.

782
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,853
Okay,
I'm going to flip on you and I'm 

783
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:05,070
starting to side with Tony.
I liked it as $10,000

784
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:06,450
make it hurt.
Earn it.

785
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,670
That's what he says.
He says,

786
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,290
I was like,
you know what?

787
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:10,630
That's fine.

788
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,750
And that's such a nice thing to say when
you're the one receiving the money.

789
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,060
My wife the other day said,
I can't give you blowjobs anymore.

790
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,920
Your Dick's too big.
And I was like,

791
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,090
well,
I can't argue with that.

792
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,613
Wow.
It's the same logic that Tony's giving 

793
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:24,314
is.
You should always pay more so that it 

794
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:28,250
would work more and you're like,
hey,

795
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,143
it does make sense.

796
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,900
Losing the logical connection as he is 
she,

797
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,860
she's saying that Tony doesn't want to 
do it.

798
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,480
No,
he's saying and so

799
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,630
brilliant marketing.
I am charging so much that it works.

800
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,340
If I,
if I charged it,

801
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:44,470
wouldn't appreciate it.
So if your wife says,

802
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,320
I don't want to suck your Dick Anymore 
because it's too big,

803
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,160
then you're,
it's,

804
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,650
I'm in the same place as if Tony robins 
customer,

805
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,860
because he's Big Dick him.
He's Big Dick at him.

806
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,510
He's going,
I'm sorry guys.

807
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,220
If you had small Dicks,
I can put you all in my mouth,

808
00:37:57,221 --> 00:37:58,370
but you've got such a big,
you're like,

809
00:37:59,220 --> 00:37:59,840
right,
right,

810
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,200
right,
right,

811
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,970
right.
But the way my Dick's not that big,

812
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,710
right?
Sure.

813
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

814
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,840
That's it's genius bucket marketing,
right

815
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,853
guys,
I'd charge extra for my shows because I 

816
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,910
know you'll remember that.
You'll remember me for a long time.

817
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:17,920
As you pay off that debt over the next 
couple of years,

818
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,750
you'll remember every time you make that
payment,

819
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:22,150
every time you get on the bus and go,
I had to sell my car story.

820
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:23,921
You'll go,
oh,

821
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:24,970
that's right.
You're like,

822
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:26,000
man,
now,

823
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,210
now I don't have a car and I'm still 
depressed.

824
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,040
I'm thanks Donnie.
No,

825
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,090
I dunno.
God bless him.

826
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:32,110
Right?
But anyway,

827
00:38:32,111 --> 00:38:34,360
we were talking about this clip.
We failed to find it.

828
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,010
Guys,
I baited you on that

829
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,540
break.
We have nothing to show you.

830
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,480
Well we,
what do we have here?

831
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:40,311
We got nothing.
I mean,

832
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:43,120
we don't have too long to find the 
moment.

833
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,040
Let me,
let me paraphrase.

834
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:46,660
And 11 you had said,

835
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,410
I remember what he said in one of these 
giant auditoriums.

836
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,930
He said they were talking about me too,
and he said,

837
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,730
you know,
it's gone too far.

838
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:55,923
He says,
I think me too was too much about the 

839
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,004
victim.
And you don't want yourself to be the 

840
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:02,614
victim.
You need to keep control of your own 

841
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:05,800
life.
So all of these people being like,

842
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,461
me too.
Me Too.

843
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:07,294
It's like you need to take control for 
your own healing and your own life and 

844
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,490
stop being the victim.
That's fine.

845
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,540
I get where he's coming from.

846
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,990
I could see why people would defend it.
I get it.

847
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,200
He offended people.
He said,

848
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,180
for example,
it's gone too far.

849
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,570
I work with ceos who just told me this 
anecdote.

850
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:24,404
They said,
I had two people applied to be my 

851
00:39:25,611 --> 00:39:26,444
secretary.
One was a very beautiful woman who was 

852
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,443
more qualified and the other was a dude 
who was less qualified than another 

853
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,030
beautiful woman.
And I hired the dude because I don't,

854
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,790
I think it's dangerous to her.
Beautiful.

855
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,110
Yeah,

856
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,450
and they didn't want to be near an 
attractive woman.

857
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,800
There is.
And I was like,

858
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:41,634
Whoa,
how about just don't fucking grab her 

859
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:45,120
tits or how about,
don't ever mention that out loud.

860
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,630
Just hard the dude and be like,
well,

861
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,340
I guess he could fight it.
And Tony,

862
00:39:50,341 --> 00:39:51,570
and then Tony was like,
by the way,

863
00:39:51,571 --> 00:39:52,404
this guy tim,
something who works for Charles Schwab 

864
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,980
said this to me.
I get,

865
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,660
I understand.
I understand.

866
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,090
I understand what he's saying.
I worked with the young lady,

867
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,770
Jessica,
Michelle Singleton,

868
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,590
very talented,
uh,

869
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,140
in Cleveland at the end of the night,
the club gives me like 12 beers,

870
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,190
cause I'm going back to my room,
all I gotta do next day eggs go off to a

871
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,220
rover,
morning glory.

872
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,960
They've got rovers,
got a big festival.

873
00:40:12,961 --> 00:40:15,060
That's all I got to do.
Go out there and party.

874
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,510
And I say to her,
which I'd say to any comic,

875
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,770
I'm in the elevator with her.

876
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,210
And I'm like,
I'm about to say,

877
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,200
Yo,
let's go to my room.

878
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,060
Because I said that to any comment.
Yeah,

879
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,260
I can't say that anymore and I don't.
And,

880
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,500
and then part of me goes,
yeah,

881
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:30,630
but she's just a comic who's going to 
talk about comedy and you're like,

882
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,310
you know,
everyone knows Erin.

883
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,473
So I get it.
We're getting out of the elevator and 

884
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:36,480
go,
I made it so fucking uncomfortable.

885
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,870
I was like,
so I'm married,

886
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,890
but,
and she's like,

887
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
oh my God,
where's this going?

888
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:42,660
And I'm like,
no,

889
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,493
hold it,
hold it.

890
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,460
And then I'll put my finger to her lips.
No,

891
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,313
no.
I made it so uncomfortable that he was 

892
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:48,864
like,
I need to be right now to hear the rest 

893
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:50,910
of his speech.
And I was like,

894
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,200
listen,
I would just say the day,

895
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,300
the guy,
but like I want wanted somebody to drink

896
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:54,510
with.

897
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,880
I don't want to just go and drink for 
myself and I want to talk about comedy.

898
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,923
And she was like,
are you trying to invite me to your 

899
00:40:59,281 --> 00:40:59,701
room?
And I go,

900
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:00,900
no,
that's not what I want.

901
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,220
But yes,
that is what I want.

902
00:41:02,221 --> 00:41:04,440
But like as a comic,
not a fucking like,

903
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,480
oh my God.
And it just spiraled.

904
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:07,314
No,
it's like I want to go back to the day 

905
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:11,400
where I could just say it and then not 
hit on you and be a good guy.

906
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,280
So did you go back to the room?
Oh,

907
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:19,281
I fucked her.
But like soaking cause obviously,

908
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:21,780
but no,
we went back to the room.

909
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,890
Um,
I basically bring her back to the room.

910
00:41:25,891 --> 00:41:27,480
That's fine.
Just whatever you do.

911
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,550
Don't stand in front of the door and 
don't,

912
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,070
and pull down your pants and jerk off.
How is Frank [inaudible] Frank?

913
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:33,990
I can open it.

914
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,823
Was that,
was that the weirdest meet till that 

915
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,310
with ever,
that was the Louis C k reference and the

916
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:42,144
saddest because it's like so weird and 
not worth it to lose such call comedy 

917
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:49,170
like hero.
But yeah,

918
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,060
he'll be back.
He'll have,

919
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,740
he'll have insane mass masturbation joke
his,

920
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,090
when he comes back,
his first joke,

921
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:59,210
he says he's going to be one of the best
jokes you've ever in your life.

922
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,590
Are you saying that very much wishing or
you have a scent?

923
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,500
I just know him.
He's a brilliant,

924
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:05,390
he's a brilliant,
brilliant mind.

925
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,650
He has been sitting by himself with his 
thoughts for the past,

926
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:11,000
what,
five months,

927
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,073
four months it hasn't like,
it's not like he's been on a time out 

928
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:15,830
that long and he won't come back for a 
while,

929
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:18,590
but when he starts coming back,
the we'll get,

930
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:19,340
we'll get like,
it's like,

931
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,173
uh,
it's like when an Artie Lange after he 

932
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,270
stabbed himself,
right.

933
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,130
And uh,
and he,

934
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:26,660
first time he got back on stage,
he has a joke.

935
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:27,494
He said No.
So how was everyone's fashion week if 

936
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:36,734
you give him that was time.
He's going to come back with something 

937
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,950
that's fucking insane.
Yeah.

938
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:40,843
And I bet and we'll hear it in the 
community cause we'll see him work out 

939
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:43,970
bits.
Yeah.

940
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,970
But when he does that special that he'll
pay for himself will release himself.

941
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,010
Not everyone will buy it,
which is fine.

942
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:52,010
I'll definitely buy it and I'll sit and 
watch them fuck out of it.

943
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,050
I will.
I definitely will.

944
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,943
He was the one guy was that was 
immediately like I definitely did all 

945
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:02,030
the things owned.
I was like Whoa.

946
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,893
Pretty aggressively.
That's a Wa that's almost quicksand 

947
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,730
level of fetish.
You know what I mean?

948
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,870
My Room.
And then all of a sudden,

949
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,920
hey,
you want to come in my room?

950
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,990
Okay,
here we go.

951
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,650
Do you mind if I jerk off and sat in 
front of the door?

952
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,600
Here's the question,
right?

953
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:21,560
Like this.
And by the way,

954
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:25,790
this is a really slippery slope to even 
bring this up to even suggest this.

955
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:31,030
But like say that is what you're sorry.
Say That is your fetish.

956
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,410
Right?
It's like say that that is the one thing

957
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:36,380
that turns you on is masturbating in 
front of and they can't escape.

958
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:36,771
No,
no,

959
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:36,980
no,
no,

960
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,221
no,
no.

961
00:43:37,221 --> 00:43:38,570
Just say masturbating in front of you.
Okay.

962
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:39,404
Let's simplify it.
Let's just say masturbate in front of 

963
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:41,870
people.
That's the thing that turns you want,

964
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:42,704
right?
Right.

965
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:47,690
How do you go about your credit?
You hire a prostitute,

966
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,071
you've,
oh,

967
00:43:48,071 --> 00:43:48,431
yeah,
yeah,

968
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:49,250
yeah.
I guess,

969
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,083
I mean,
you ever say something to someone and 

970
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:53,090
then you don't realize what you're 
saying?

971
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,650
Like I said to someone the other day,
I go,

972
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,753
I go,
here's,

973
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,530
okay,
here's I guess,

974
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,160
well,
I was just,

975
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,740
I didn't even begin to finish answering 
that question.

976
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,503
You got me.
You got me.

977
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,580
I said to my wife and son were friends.
I said,

978
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,500
we're talking about something.
I go,

979
00:44:06,501 --> 00:44:07,334
well,
here's the problem is I was talking 

980
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:09,730
about Kitty Porn.
They're talking about Kiddie porn,

981
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:10,491
and I go,
yeah,

982
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:14,840
but what about this is that these guys 
that would be pedophiles at least,

983
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:17,540
or just watching Kiddie porn,
and then my wife goes,

984
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,580
what about the children in the second 
video?

985
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:20,121
And I was like,
oh yeah,

986
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:20,954
good point.
Good point.

987
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,090
I didn't think it through.
Yeah,

988
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,770
yeah,
yeah.

989
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:26,361
Right,
right,

990
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:26,721
right,
right,

991
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:27,554
right.

992
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,130
Exactly.
Like you say,

993
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,450
uh,
I don't know,

994
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,300
but you can,
I mean,

995
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,000
you can find a consenting person.
Right?

996
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,540
I guess that was his move is that he 
would be like,

997
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,400
do you mind if I masturbate in front of 
me?

998
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:42,234
I guess.
And it's also the places he did it was 

999
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,124
that they do it at a bar and no one 
calls foul are you find a random girl 

1000
00:44:47,941 --> 00:44:50,190
and you go on a couple of days,
maybe he doesn't like the dates,

1001
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:51,030
it's just the random,
hey,

1002
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:52,050
how you doing?
Bob's your uncle,

1003
00:44:52,051 --> 00:44:53,040
God bless,
see you later.

1004
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,383
But I think the problem was that they 
were familiar and were working where it 

1005
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:00,440
was a power structure.

1006
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:03,631
Like,
Hey,

1007
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:04,950
do you mind if I jerk off in front of 
you?

1008
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:06,280
And you're like,
oh.

1009
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,400
And I remember saying to my wife when 
that went down,

1010
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:09,300
and by this,
by the way,

1011
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:10,134
this is just honesty and if you're 
through the roof about me sharing 

1012
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:14,250
honesty,
I apologize.

1013
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,720
But this is,
I'm just talking.

1014
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,280
I said to my wife,
I go,

1015
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,530
I go,
but why didn't they just say no?

1016
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,090
Like,
why didn't they just walk away?

1017
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,620
And my wife goes,
okay,

1018
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:26,370
let me role play it for you brock Lesnar
and you are in a hotel room.

1019
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,001
And he's like,
Hey,

1020
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:29,040
do you mind if I jack off?
She's like,

1021
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:30,630
do you think given an option in there?
And I'm like,

1022
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,411
yeah,
good call.

1023
00:45:31,411 --> 00:45:33,570
Also.
It's just so startling.

1024
00:45:33,571 --> 00:45:34,920
Have a question.
Yeah.

1025
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,820
And I bet you're probably like,
wait,

1026
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,380
is this going to be a joke?
Is this going?

1027
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:40,550
Sure.
Sure.

1028
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:41,450
Like,
yeah,

1029
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,313
go ahead.
And then all of a sudden he drops trial 

1030
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,380
and you're like,
Whoa,

1031
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:47,450
what do I do now?
And then it's already started and you're

1032
00:45:47,451 --> 00:45:48,410
like,
okay,

1033
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,820
we're already can do it.
Yeah.

1034
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,421
Yeah.
That,

1035
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:54,230
it's just a weird situation.
By the way,

1036
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:57,370
I'm a fan of Louise.
I love my favorite.

1037
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,073
Surely find my,
I found myself thinking about him like 

1038
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,880
if you remember like a week ago and I 
told you I hope,

1039
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:07,900
I hope he has some good friends around 
me that will keep him like,

1040
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,190
you know,
like I,

1041
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:10,024
it's,
he's probably going through like the 

1042
00:46:11,531 --> 00:46:13,840
worst time possible

1043
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,010
they took away.
I mean like,

1044
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:15,863
like this,
he has daughters like it's got to be so 

1045
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,630
bad.
I was just talking about my wife jacking

1046
00:46:20,631 --> 00:46:23,180
me off and my special and my daughters 
will see that and be like,

1047
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,130
eh.
You're like,

1048
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,220
well mom's not good at it.
Yeah,

1049
00:46:28,221 --> 00:46:31,160
I did see that by the land and jobs can 
be,

1050
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,023
they can be a tug sometimes.
She tried to get me one the other night 

1051
00:46:33,951 --> 00:46:34,784
and I was like,
no.

1052
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:38,110
It's like I'd rather just go to bed 
unsatisfied.

1053
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,460
Just go to sleep.
Thank you.

1054
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,513
She was like trying to problem solve it.
What am I turned off all the lights I 

1055
00:46:42,231 --> 00:46:42,501
go,
yeah,

1056
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:45,550
like a ghost is jacking me off cause the
middle of two lab.

1057
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,230
Yeah.
No I,

1058
00:46:48,231 --> 00:46:50,330
yeah,
I can't by the way.

1059
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:55,190
Secret time available now on Netflix.
Definitely check it out.

1060
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,630
You all have netflix.

1061
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,120
Everybody has netflix watch.
Secret time.

1062
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,740
Thank you.
After this podcast,

1063
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,040
you can watch it now.
Pull up another window.

1064
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:09,041
Like it's a free world barking.
Yeah.

1065
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,460
Anyway,
I did actually,

1066
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:15,710
I did want to ask you,
I have a whole lot to get to,

1067
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,770
but since we're talking about secret 
time now on Netflix,

1068
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,780
um,
Bert Kreischer,

1069
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,900
um,
we had spoken,

1070
00:47:23,901 --> 00:47:26,000
I see,
I saw you do a gesture and,

1071
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,860
and the special where you're talking 
about the Alabama wet wipe.

1072
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,210
Okay.
And,

1073
00:47:31,211 --> 00:47:32,860
but that,
the joke was great,

1074
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,190
but what peaked my interest was this.
Oh my God.

1075
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,213
Oh,
was that when you went to the fucking 

1076
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:42,110
jerk?
Can I tell you when I,

1077
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,061
I didn't,
I,

1078
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:44,740
it's so natural because I white from the
front.

1079
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:46,240
I went from the front,
I went from the front.

1080
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:47,380
I'm a front white.

1081
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,170
Thank you.
Okay.

1082
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,460
Because the thing that kids do,
they go home and you go,

1083
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,080
oh,
hurry.

1084
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:07,120
Discriminated against for front wiping.
I've been ostracized.

1085
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,730
I ain't feel like I'm at the forefront 
of an important,

1086
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,380
I love us will notice that.
Oh,

1087
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:17,470
that's so far ethan.
He just wiped from the front.

1088
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:18,543
And I was like,
well,

1089
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,381
and I,
and I'm,

1090
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:20,214
and I feel if I'm being,
and I don't want to flower this up and 

1091
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:25,960
we make a hyperbolic statements,
but I feel like Rosa Parks of the wiping

1092
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:27,430
movement for men.
I can,

1093
00:48:27,431 --> 00:48:29,880
I tell you the word,
I always thought I'm a foreigner.

1094
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,170
I always felt like a four runner of 
wiping.

1095
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,610
Yeah.
As you lift the balls,

1096
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:36,790
when you wipe,
I lift and pull to the side.

1097
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:38,810
I'm getting that old,
right.

1098
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,510
I and I rap.
You can wrap them around the hand.

1099
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,760
I go in and add it.
I like it.

1100
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,340
Like you're lighting a match,
right?

1101
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:48,580
Like I go,
I don't go,

1102
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:51,510
I don't drag or it was a cool,
you should all of your balls.

1103
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,610
And I said,
Oh,

1104
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:55,444
don't you wipe shit up your back.
What's wrong with you doing this for 

1105
00:48:58,301 --> 00:49:02,830
decades?
I literally cannot wipe from the back.

1106
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:03,660
I don't.
I try it.

1107
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,493
It's insane.
What are you stand up fucking idiot if 

1108
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:13,980
you walk in on me wiping.
I looked just like chilling.

1109
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,243
Yeah.
So growers from the back and he just 

1110
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:21,540
goes,
imagine you have to,

1111
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,240
and you look at your toilet when you're 
white,

1112
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,953
you have to stand up.
There's not that much space back there 

1113
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:32,200
going to get shit on your ass.
The front half labor,

1114
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:35,200
Vagina from the back.
You ladies do that because you're not,

1115
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:36,034
you're not,
you wipe your vagina from the back 

1116
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:41,240
because you don't want to risk the 
lady's like a germ.

1117
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,333
The ladies,
the ladies are supposed to pull it back 

1118
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:50,140
away from the uh wow.
That's what the ladies do.

1119
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:52,600
But I thought you went from front and 
back backs.

1120
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,700
Can I tell you the anecdote that I've 
ever said?

1121
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,850
This conversation was sprung out of one 
time.

1122
00:49:57,851 --> 00:50:00,040
I was in college with all my friends and
my,

1123
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,190
and one of my friends was telling a 
story about how he had a friend with one

1124
00:50:03,191 --> 00:50:04,720
arm and I said,
wow,

1125
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:05,554
how does he lift his balls up anyway?
And I was with like four other friends 

1126
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:14,011
and they all went and they all were back
wiping psychopath and they all said what

1127
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,820
they were like,
what the fuck?

1128
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:21,710
And I wouldn't pay no joke.
Okay.

1129
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,700
Two gig salary to be in a time machine 
in that room with you guys.

1130
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,713
And the look on your face wipes is that 
everybody was making fun of me because 

1131
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,050
they were all back wipers.
And the thing that was crazy about it is

1132
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:42,884
that we didn't know each other existed.
There are two types of people in this 

1133
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:47,410
world.

1134
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:48,243
Right.
And they don't know they existed until 

1135
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:54,731
I'm again the nes Nelson Mandela of ass 
white dude.

1136
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,260
And I've opened this dialogue.
Thank you.

1137
00:50:57,261 --> 00:51:01,280
I hope that we'll find people like us 
and we can share our own secrets.

1138
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,203
Well,
yeah,

1139
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,253
I and I,
I took a poll on twitter today cause I 

1140
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:06,260
wanted to get to the heart of this.
Yeah.

1141
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:10,070
60% from the back,
40% from the front.

1142
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,610
So we're not that rare species.
That's almost a perfect split.

1143
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,110
I once,
uh,

1144
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,110
brought it up on stage because I went,
I did the,

1145
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,760
did the joke and someone goes,
oh,

1146
00:51:19,761 --> 00:51:21,800
you wiped from the front.
I don't even think of it.

1147
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:23,210
It doesn't even matter.
It's just how I wipe.

1148
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,260
And I go,
Yo,

1149
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,370
how do you wipe?
And the guy who was,

1150
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,710
I swear to God,
he goes side to side.

1151
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:32,830
That's the most fuck what I go,
but hey,

1152
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:36,500
where does your hand to enter?

1153
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,610
He goes,
it doesn't matter.

1154
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:40,610
It's side to side.
Was this a bit of a heckle?

1155
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,290
No,
it was in Atlanta.

1156
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,230
It was in Atlanta and I was like,
wait,

1157
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,630
what?
Like yeah,

1158
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,240
I have always been.
Here's the other thing is my dad,

1159
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,030
we talked kind of talking about this 
with my family.

1160
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,580
No,
my dad goes all who wipes from the front

1161
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:56,414
and I go,
Dad,

1162
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,400
you taught me how to wipe my ass.
I,

1163
00:51:58,401 --> 00:51:59,530
yeah,
you there?

1164
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,373
The first time I did it,
why didn't you stop me then and put me 

1165
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,180
on your right path.
This is where I'm at.

1166
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,133
My Dad had the same conversation because
he's listening to the podcast and he 

1167
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:10,700
goes,
I failed you as a father.

1168
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:12,340
I'm like this week.
And I'm like,

1169
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,120
I'm your son,
Dude.

1170
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:17,270
I don't know how I learned to lift up my
boss and scoop out the shit.

1171
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,080
I've picked that up from somewhere.
Or maybe you didn't fucking teach me.

1172
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,430
Yeah,
you did fail me.

1173
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,100
And by the way,
my method of wiping that I learned on my

1174
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:29,480
own is better.
Can Hot shit can high five buck.

1175
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:31,430
Yeah.
My way of being way of wiping is so much

1176
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:32,270
better.
Superior.

1177
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,380
Yeah.
You can't get the fuck out.

1178
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:37,910
You go wet you and wet or dry.
Are you pure dry or do you use a baby?

1179
00:52:37,911 --> 00:52:38,744
What?
Oh,

1180
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:41,450
it's Alabama wet wipe.
You actually do that.

1181
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,050
Fucking kidding me.
It's serious.

1182
00:52:45,051 --> 00:52:47,510
Try it when you're done.
You have a hairy asshole.

1183
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,250
No,
he doesn't have stick.

1184
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,233
Okay,
so if we're going to get into the 

1185
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,150
specifics of this.
Yes.

1186
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,870
When you're in a bind.
Okay.

1187
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,090
A road trip.
Gas Station.

1188
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,810
The paper toilet paper like this 
pamphlet.

1189
00:52:58,910 --> 00:52:59,601
Good.
Legit,

1190
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:04,280
right.
Scrolls on like you fold it,

1191
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:04,851
fold it,
fold it.

1192
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:07,580
You need a clean side.
You need a straight up clean site.

1193
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,790
First piece of loose leaf,
just a little bit of a spit.

1194
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,090
It's cool if it's got a little bit of a 
little bit of consistency to it.

1195
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,430
Hear me out.
It's my asshole.

1196
00:53:16,431 --> 00:53:19,400
Okay.
Drink some water and then go in and just

1197
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:21,320
give it a good one.
You'll go back and forth at it.

1198
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:23,510
Cause that's when you start losing paper
and had stairs.

1199
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,980
So the,
I think what you were,

1200
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,160
your advantageous

1201
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,680
is that you're using the Torah paper as 
you described.

1202
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,630
I don't know.
We're all papers.

1203
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,050
Yeah.
Well maybe think of a Torah.

1204
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:34,943
Exactly.
Yeah.

1205
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,330
I don't use the actual Dora.
How would be inconsiderate,

1206
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:39,390
but yeah.
And then,

1207
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,060
but now I got,
uh,

1208
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,650
I got the water spraying toilet.
Okay.

1209
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:47,600
He got the bid day.
Yeah.

1210
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:51,940
Sometimes it's free for like two years.
I've,

1211
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,330
I've had days where I'm like,
I'm gonna roll it.

1212
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,164
I think I got everything.
Do you get shit streaks in your 

1213
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,870
underwear?
I don't want to wear,

1214
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,030
oh,
you get shit in your pants.

1215
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:00,811
I don't know.
Too Dark.

1216
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:04,440
I don't know.
And you are living wild and free.

1217
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,410
Yeah.
I'm,

1218
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,510
I'm,
I'm a foreigner.

1219
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,380
And was that at Tom Segura thing the 
day?

1220
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:12,000
Boy?
I know you got the bid day first.

1221
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,343
And I went to his house,
I walked into his bathroom and this 

1222
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:19,990
wasn't open,
like screaming.

1223
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:25,170
And then I was like shit in his house 
and I came out to him and he goes,

1224
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:26,004
I go dude.
He goes,

1225
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,830
I know it's amazing.
I was like,

1226
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,010
well where did you get that?
And he was like,

1227
00:54:29,011 --> 00:54:32,400
dude gave me the name of his place.
We redid our house and I told my wife,

1228
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:33,510
I go,
I want one of those toilets.

1229
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,910
But I had seen them in Japan.
I'd gotten them in Japan.

1230
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,053
No so obsessed him with them in Japan 
that I would sometimes sit on my toilet 

1231
00:54:39,511 --> 00:54:42,610
and relax and just have it hit me in the
bubble that they're just going,

1232
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,500
oh God.
All the years it did hose down.

1233
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,840
We had this conversation with them on a 
company's sent us one of these toilets.

1234
00:54:51,841 --> 00:54:52,674
But what's the name of the place?
I know the place while bio but it's the 

1235
00:54:54,811 --> 00:54:56,960
same ones we got guaranteed like that.

1236
00:54:56,970 --> 00:55:00,440
I just need to install it.
It's a little complicated to install and

1237
00:55:00,441 --> 00:55:01,274
you know,
do you need a plumber and you need 

1238
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:04,410
electrician?
Don't start shit cause you got to have a

1239
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,550
man job.
Well don't you wish you could.

1240
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,260
I mean you seem like a handy guy.
Do you?

1241
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:12,480
Can you do stuff or is it complicated?
No,

1242
00:55:12,481 --> 00:55:14,790
that one's really cool.
You got to rewire all the shit.

1243
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,653
You need a plug inside your bathroom and
then you need a separate entrance for 

1244
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:21,870
the water to go up.
Like it's really complicated.

1245
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:25,800
Yeah,
fence for the ass massage.

1246
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:29,040
This whole massage.
It is so it's gotten to the point,

1247
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:29,874
not even joking that sometimes like when
I was on the road doing travel channel 

1248
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:34,123
like right,
because I think right towards the tail 

1249
00:55:35,191 --> 00:55:37,080
end is when our first,
when I was first got him,

1250
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:41,550
was in Japan when I was doing travel 
channel is that I go in with a bottle of

1251
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:42,690
water and just squirt.

1252
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:46,670
It was like,
oh,

1253
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,210
would you wipe when you did that?
When I did that not start try before the

1254
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,950
first squirt.
Oh,

1255
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:57,900
I don't know.
I just get enough pressure.

1256
00:55:57,901 --> 00:55:58,780
Huh?
Oh God.

1257
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,780
It's like a power wash.
It's got so much pressure.

1258
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:03,840
It can break the o ring sometimes and it
turns into an enema.

1259
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,170
I'm not even joking all.
I've definitely had a break.

1260
00:56:06,171 --> 00:56:08,550
They'll ring where it gets inside you 
and you're like,

1261
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:09,450
okay,
that's coming out.

1262
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,800
But it's warm so it feels good.
And then it's just jumpstart in the next

1263
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,500
month.
Waterpik a lot like a waterpik.

1264
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:17,973
Can I tell you the invention I want?
I want a waterpik inside my shower so 

1265
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:22,260
when I'm showering I can just waterpik 
my teacher.

1266
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,833
I love

1267
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,810
clean it out.
Right.

1268
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:32,340
Extra long are and be like,
let's hose him out to switch between two

1269
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:37,470
a mouth.
Ever heard of Acmr?

1270
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,813
Yes.
So I've been meaning to watch a Isamar 

1271
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,530
videos.
I have never in all of our career online

1272
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:45,623
watch some more videos.
I've been meaning to talk about it 

1273
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:48,334
forever.
But I thought that you would enjoy to 

1274
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:51,800
watch it out given your affinity with 
the uh,

1275
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,833
wonderful things with the Internet.
My daughter's got into asm or really I 

1276
00:56:57,671 --> 00:57:02,230
think it's a lack of living,
a real authentic life that you go like,

1277
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:05,420
I need something real like,
yeah,

1278
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:10,950
women eating pasta like God and it's 
like really hate,

1279
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:17,850
right?
I mean like whispering and chewing.

1280
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:21,220
I mean there's a lot of interesting ones
here.

1281
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:22,870
For example,
this is,

1282
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:27,220
so this is kind of a par for the course 
here.

1283
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:30,160
Okay.
This is a normal regular one.

1284
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,340
This is the most popular Acmr channel on
Youtube.

1285
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:34,990
And by the way,
5 million reviews.

1286
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,230
Look at the views on her channel.
Look at this.

1287
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,820
Oh,
she's 26 million.

1288
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:43,140
24 million,
20 million a year yet.

1289
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,910
What do you think this would be the same
if she was ugly?

1290
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,440
Absolutely not.
No,

1291
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:49,331
no,
they,

1292
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:50,164
it's uh,
it's uh,

1293
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:54,640
I was watching these before the show in 
our intern was putting them together for

1294
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:57,610
me and I'm like,
I feel like I'm cheating on either right

1295
00:57:57,611 --> 00:57:58,444
now.
Like this is so weirdly intimate that I 

1296
00:58:01,031 --> 00:58:03,280
am uncomfortable watching this being 
married.

1297
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:04,623
Like I was surprised.
You say your daughters watch it cause 

1298
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,970
well there's,
there's so many different varieties.

1299
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:12,840
My kids are the popular ones.
My kids are into people eating and like,

1300
00:58:12,841 --> 00:58:16,690
and like one of the Smr is that they do 
is those slime videos where it's just,

1301
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,820
they have it.
She was a slob.

1302
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:23,130
My daughters have a slime dude.
That's a new generation of quicksand.

1303
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:26,470
A it bro.
Bro,

1304
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:30,340
there will be people going,
oh my God,

1305
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:31,450
listen to her pop.
She's like,

1306
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,890
actually this one,
this she's how old is?

1307
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:41,800
You don't have to say she's killed.
This is the one that I was watching.

1308
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:42,634
I was like,
I feel like I'm cheating on Isla right 

1309
00:58:43,331 --> 00:58:45,880
now.
This she's doing this.

1310
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:48,730
Holy Shit.
What the fuck is that?

1311
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:54,970
You don't do this for me.
I get nervous from this sound.

1312
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,010
That's the opposite to me.
Shut up and put that hand to job away.

1313
00:59:00,011 --> 00:59:00,844
Can I get some of this?
Which you remember when we were kids 

1314
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,503
when I was kid and you do this.
You go and then you go behind someone 

1315
00:59:07,451 --> 00:59:10,320
and it sounded like a b.
What?

1316
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,900
I've never done that.
You quit.

1317
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,670
You can't do it yourself.
Do it to someone else.

1318
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,410
It's not like a B,
right?

1319
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,253
It's not happening in the early day Smr.
But watch this and tell me how 

1320
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,140
uncomfortable you are right here.
Let me crank it up.

1321
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,033
Everybody

1322
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:30,480
Smr,
why are just feeling relaxation?

1323
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,243
I so they whispered.
Crinkly gain all the way up so you can 

1324
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:39,360
hear every little thing.
Start you off with Jagger zero.

1325
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:44,180
She's going to put lotion on her hands.
I need to do a poll a bit.

1326
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,910
When people like me who like this makes 
me the opposite of relax.

1327
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,830
It's making it be relaxed.
I'll lead off really.

1328
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,450
I actually might listen to this in the 
car.

1329
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:58,260
I find it relaxing.
I find it very relaxing,

1330
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,750
but it makes me like nervous and

1331
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,153
like

1332
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:05,030
if I put this on at night,
I feel like

1333
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:06,783
a creep

1334
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,171
because,
well,

1335
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,010
not a creep.
I'm not gonna.

1336
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,870
I'm not going to label everyone that 
enjoys his videos,

1337
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,570
but I feel like I'm in an intro.
I feel like I'm cheating on you.

1338
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:15,010
I really do.
It's like,

1339
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:15,740
hmm.

1340
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,100
Yeah.

1341
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,040
This whole role play thing.
It's like a,

1342
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,510
I mean man,
okay,

1343
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:26,700
this shit that is topic.
Why does this,

1344
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,930
this is lotion.
I hope she puts it on her lips.

1345
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:44,900
Her Lips,
who lived looks really fucking dry.

1346
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,213
Anyway,
at the end she ends up putting up her 

1347
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:48,290
ass.
It's a crazy twist,

1348
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:49,940
but it's very pornographic or what's the
end?

1349
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,433
Okay.

1350
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,150
This is so bizarre.
It's so weird.

1351
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,860
I just think that it's really a lot of 
lonely guys out right

1352
01:00:59,040 --> 01:00:59,873
there.

1353
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:03,770
This is akin to like one of those 
futuristic movies.

1354
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:05,920
Okay.

1355
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,270
She just grabbed a bag of baby wife.
She's got whatever fucking nearby man.

1356
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:13,560
This is just the idea that she knows 
this would play well.

1357
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:14,910
Yeah,
he's a pro.

1358
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,313
Well,
honestly I just wipe my wonder who 

1359
01:01:18,961 --> 01:01:19,794
started it.

1360
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,910
I do get,
I do have a sensation,

1361
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,740
although they say it's supposed to be in
your scalp,

1362
01:01:27,741 --> 01:01:29,600
but I feel like here,
oh,

1363
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:32,090
if I watch a video where like a dude 
falls,

1364
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,283
like you ever see the videos where the 
guy tries to dive off the balcony and 

1365
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:38,130
misses the pool man's on his back.
My asshole gets taken away.

1366
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:41,070
Like goes,
it goes really bad.

1367
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,420
You don't ask for more videos on like 
our,

1368
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:46,620
um,
our chiropractors.

1369
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:47,803
Mm.
Listen to like a role play or just type 

1370
01:01:49,911 --> 01:01:53,300
in them chiropractor and you can hear a 
guy cracker guys back.

1371
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,220
For some reason.
It makes me feel like,

1372
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,250
like I worked out or something.
Yeah.

1373
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,010
Let's watch the ace chiropractic.
Yeah,

1374
01:01:59,100 --> 01:01:59,933
just type it and smart chiropractor.
I guarantee you just all these 

1375
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:05,570
backpackers and they just,
it's like they mike their chest and then

1376
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:07,280
crack the guys back.
But is it real?

1377
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,040
Real and I'm,
I could watch I,

1378
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:13,370
there's a lot on instagram,
but it looks like she's having a baby.

1379
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,413
I was still,
a lot of them are cute girls in like 

1380
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:15,914
spandex too doesn't hurt.
It's like we're going to have a cheese 

1381
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,600
burger.
Let's eat it outside this fucking guy.

1382
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,880
Oh,
do you hear that?

1383
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:28,030
This fucking guy.
There it goes.

1384
01:02:28,031 --> 01:02:30,100
Great.
You telling me this guy doesn't grab ass

1385
01:02:30,101 --> 01:02:31,540
a little appropriately or 
inappropriately?

1386
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:32,710
Every now and then.
Yeah.

1387
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:34,930
He doesn't just brush a little too close
on that ass.

1388
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:38,490
Like that comp.

1389
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,040
That's what I'd be.
Sound effects?

1390
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:42,521
No,
no,

1391
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:43,121
no.
Oh,

1392
01:02:43,121 --> 01:02:45,300
I guess they could do anything,
right?

1393
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:48,250
Crossbow thought.
Oh my God.

1394
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:54,360
Good.
Right.

1395
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:04,400
This is weird.
Chiropractics might be all for me.

1396
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,400
Oh,
this will be a good one all the way out.

1397
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,013
Oh,

1398
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,360
did you feel it a little?
I could feel it.

1399
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:13,710
A little bit of a relief.

1400
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:18,320
I gotta tell you.
I think it's edited though.

1401
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:19,190
Sounds,
I don't think,

1402
01:03:19,191 --> 01:03:21,380
I don't know about that either.
That's to break it up.

1403
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:23,980
Follow it.
Because they,

1404
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,410
they do it.
They,

1405
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,860
all they say is from our channels to do 
this

1406
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:28,723
same thing where they turn the gain all 
the way up and they're super quiet so 

1407
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:33,950
you can hear all these little things.

1408
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:40,050
That sounds real.
Here we go.

1409
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:43,350
Oh,
I want that done.

1410
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:47,720
He was so angry after he did it.
Feel like slam the towel on this.

1411
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,730
Oh wait,
I got to see that move again.

1412
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,133
Whoa.

1413
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:53,870
Okay.

1414
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,070
Hang on.
Watch this movie.

1415
01:03:55,071 --> 01:03:55,210
Yeah.

1416
01:03:55,210 --> 01:04:00,210
Oh fuck.
Oh Man.

1417
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,570
So funny.
Back in like

1418
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:03,523
1990 1997 I got a,
what they called it dat recorder and 

1419
01:04:10,011 --> 01:04:10,844
you'd record it.
Just did really crisp audio who were 

1420
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:15,230
expensive.
They were like 600 bucks.

1421
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,083
It's like,
it's basically an h four and or like an 

1422
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:20,120
h six one of the zoom recorders.
Yeah.

1423
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:24,920
But I could record things and it would,
it would sound more clear than it did in

1424
01:04:24,921 --> 01:04:27,290
the room.
And so I would,

1425
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:28,124
me and my friends got high.
It was right when I moved to New York 

1426
01:04:29,391 --> 01:04:30,224
and spend them in 1998 99 and I would 
record us all hanging out without them 

1427
01:04:37,101 --> 01:04:40,700
knowing and then I'd play it for them 
and they'd listen to it.

1428
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,040
US hanging out five minutes ago in their
headsets,

1429
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:46,070
they'd be like,
this is amazing because it was so Chris.

1430
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,330
Hmm.
So clear.

1431
01:04:47,331 --> 01:04:49,950
You were like,
I can't believe I'm in the room in,

1432
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:50,973
you know,
like,

1433
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,900
so I guess I should have gotten into 
smart back then.

1434
01:04:53,901 --> 01:04:54,734
I'd be oh yeah.
You would would've been a trailblazer 

1435
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:59,630
for sure.
A trillionaire um,

1436
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:00,613
you know who liz,
who actually does listen to these every 

1437
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:02,864
night.
Who?

1438
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:03,763
Ian?

1439
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:04,690
Yeah,

1440
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:05,530
the intern.
Oh,

1441
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:06,970
for real.
[inaudible] are you there?

1442
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:08,140
Uh,
yeah,

1443
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:13,140
I'm here.
So you are a consumer of Asm are right?

1444
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,390
Yeah.
Not every night,

1445
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,190
but I watch a few.

1446
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,580
What does it do for you?
You,

1447
01:05:20,581 --> 01:05:22,600
what you want it to fall asleep while do
you watch it?

1448
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,360
Like what do you get out of it is 
relaxing.

1449
01:05:25,361 --> 01:05:28,060
It's kind of calming.
It's like instead of just putting a show

1450
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:32,020
on TV to fall asleep to,
I have someone whisper in my ear.

1451
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:33,280
You liked the cute girls,
right?

1452
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,510
It,
those are the ones you picked out,

1453
01:05:34,511 --> 01:05:36,970
like the cute popular girls.
I,

1454
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:41,050
I just searched a smr and those are 
always the top ones that come up.

1455
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,250
So not,
not enough.

1456
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,410
Right.
To find the alternative.

1457
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,080
Do you ever feel seduced by these girls?
Do you ever feel like you're,

1458
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:49,810
I mean it is quite intimate.
Do you feel that intimacy?

1459
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:51,340
Oh,
well we're all in love,

1460
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,630
right?
Yeah.

1461
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,970
Girls.
Yeah.

1462
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,130
Yeah.
I've felt like I've formed relationships

1463
01:05:57,131 --> 01:05:59,620
with people that I called the one line 
long healthy way.

1464
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,860
A lot of them,
like a lot of them,

1465
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:03,703
I followed them and I get someone to 
their lives and then I'll be like on 

1466
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,340
instagram and I'll be like,
Adam.

1467
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:11,770
Yeah.
Um,

1468
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:14,140
do you ever watch it with guys?
Do you feel,

1469
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,350
uh,
I've seen one or two.

1470
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:18,184
I've been auto rolled into a guy.
And do you feel like gay at all when 

1471
01:06:21,161 --> 01:06:22,120
that happens?
I mean,

1472
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:25,690
not to like put it bluntly,
but I feel like intimate.

1473
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,033
You get with your get with your boys and
have him whisper in your ear and you 

1474
01:06:30,581 --> 01:06:31,640
know it's fun.
Okay.

1475
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,630
There's some,
I would like to take ai smarter.

1476
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,400
The next level do like black eyed a 
movie theater,

1477
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:37,234
a smr where you're,
you're going can hear the movie theater 

1478
01:06:38,831 --> 01:06:40,690
and everything we use here.
The black guy just talking like,

1479
01:06:40,691 --> 01:06:41,860
man,
this ain't going to happen.

1480
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,253
He's a west spring,
but he's with with away brother doesn't 

1481
01:06:46,651 --> 01:06:49,450
envy what they have a bunch of role 
playing stuff for real.

1482
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,700
Um,
here's one guy that's super popular.

1483
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:53,160
I just think he's got a whole thing 
going.

1484
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,850
This isn't a real human [inaudible] his 
name.

1485
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:55,923
No,
this isn't it.

1486
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,710
I thought that was a robot.
Yeah.

1487
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:04,030
His name is Tony.
That's not a real name.

1488
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:12,100
Have you watched Tony Bam.
Bonnie and I have not.

1489
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:16,180
My name is Tony Bomboni.
We'll be doing your makeup today.

1490
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,780
Do you feel relaxed by this one?
Do you feel the same way?

1491
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:21,820
Can I tell you I really do.
In a weird way.

1492
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:23,650
Like,
I feel like he's an anesthesiologist.

1493
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:25,960
The way he introduced himself,
I was like,

1494
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:27,003
I'm going to be putting you under today.
Need to start cutting backwards from 

1495
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:30,790
what kind of makeup?
You're lucky.

1496
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:33,460
So I say weird thing.
So He's just whispering.

1497
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,320
Yeah,
I can't stand like the home.

1498
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:38,350
That's the shock.
No one usually tells me that,

1499
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:40,000
but thank you.
What did I say?

1500
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:40,740
What did I say?
Yeah,

1501
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:41,081
wait,
wait,

1502
01:07:41,081 --> 01:07:41,914
wait.
Let's compliment like you look like a 

1503
01:07:42,341 --> 01:07:43,174
fucking robot.
No one ever tells me that you remind me 

1504
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:48,400
of Max headroom.
But then so then we get really weird.

1505
01:07:48,401 --> 01:07:49,610
Okay,
now let's go down the hole.

1506
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:53,470
The rabbit hole.
So here's one that's very popular.

1507
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:57,190
Bitchy,
popular girl knew stepsister role play.

1508
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,770
So it's both.
So she like humiliates you.

1509
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:01,330
Yeah,
very cute girl.

1510
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,370
Obviously that's how it works.
I'm learning.

1511
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,700
Oh my God.
Humiliate you while she relaxes you.

1512
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:09,300
Wash this.
Oh,

1513
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,530
I don't know what my dad does.
He's in your mom

1514
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:20,750
or for that matter,
but let's just be clear.

1515
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:26,540
We are not friends.
Not Want to be associated with you.

1516
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,850
Can you?
Any circumstances.

1517
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,753
Okay.

1518
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:30,730
What do you think about that?

1519
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:36,010
No,
I'm not okay with it.

1520
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:41,670
Imagine trying to fall asleep to this.
This is your shit,

1521
01:08:42,281 --> 01:08:43,450
right dude,
I want,

1522
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:46,270
I need to go deeper into it then.
By the way,

1523
01:08:46,271 --> 01:08:48,710
I will just be doing this on open tabs 
next week.

1524
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,040
This is fucking genius.

1525
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:56,530
It's all right.

1526
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,513
I just said,
I just joking when I said black out a 

1527
01:08:59,621 --> 01:09:02,710
movie theater.
They really do this,

1528
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:05,610
but I don't know if black on them.
That would be such a hilarious,

1529
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,180
just the mercy of black.
I'd be like,

1530
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:09,280
Oh man,
they're going to kill the woods.

1531
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:11,680
Oh Shit.
All right.

1532
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:14,440
I wouldn't go there.
Hey pastor the popcorn.

1533
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:16,743
I just love the idea of someone like an 
laying in a bed at night who have 

1534
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:19,773
usually this is the asm are relaxed and 
you've just got this girl like bitching 

1535
01:09:22,421 --> 01:09:25,030
at you and your ear.
It's like you're relaxing and she's also

1536
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:28,480
like humiliating and bitching at you.
Can we just give it up to Gwen Jizz?

1537
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,233
Is that her name?
Gwen?

1538
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,850
Yeah.
Quiz quiz.

1539
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,730
Quiz.
One quiz dude.

1540
01:09:36,731 --> 01:09:39,130
She's got a tip jar.
Just a straight up paypal link.

1541
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,590
Shut up.
Oh,

1542
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,493
I pay her.
I give her some glute cause let me tell 

1543
01:09:44,141 --> 01:09:44,974
you something.
She does 17 minutes and 59 seconds of 

1544
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:50,200
Improv about being a bitch.
I'm curious.

1545
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:51,340
Are you kidding me?
Yeah,

1546
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:54,310
she is drawing this from a real place.
This is the real thing.

1547
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:58,930
What could you talk about and Ansa Mar 
for 20 minutes without having to go to a

1548
01:09:58,931 --> 01:09:59,940
script.
Well,

1549
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,610
there's another one mean bipolar girl.
Oh mean popular girl.

1550
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:07,990
I don't want bipolar girl that,
that's deep.

1551
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,080
I fucking hate you.
I love you.

1552
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,830
Oh yeah.
I,

1553
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:13,960
let's see how this escalates.
Let's skip to the end.

1554
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:19,523
Oh,
she's like,

1555
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,073
Oh,
you can kill time by just filing your 

1556
01:10:22,311 --> 01:10:25,070
nails,
which she's combing your hair.

1557
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,200
She's,
Oh my God.

1558
01:10:28,201 --> 01:10:29,850
This is fucking genius.
Wait,

1559
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:32,190
you think that she flipped coming your 
sister's hair,

1560
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,770
the new sister there.
She makes fun of your hair.

1561
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,173
You're right.
You picked up on that where that is so 

1562
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:46,720
cool.
I could totally get into this.

1563
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:55,100
This is kind of dropped app a little 
bit.

1564
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:03,310
So much depression.
Oh No,

1565
01:11:03,311 --> 01:11:04,950
you're stupid.
Yeah.

1566
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,300
This bitch has never put on makeup 
before.

1567
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,050
So anyway,
it gets much weirder.

1568
01:11:10,051 --> 01:11:11,610
I mean,
this is just the surface.

1569
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,890
This is insane.
What's going on here?

1570
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:15,300
Why are all my notes on here?
Come on,

1571
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:17,460
get out.
Get the fuck out of here.

1572
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,330
No,
I closed it.

1573
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:21,103
I want it.
I want to think of my asm are role 

1574
01:11:22,751 --> 01:11:26,490
playing that I could get in.
So what would that be?

1575
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:28,260
Um,
okay.

1576
01:11:28,261 --> 01:11:30,030
Well it's gotta be something people 
connect to,

1577
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:30,893
right?
It can't just be something that you're 

1578
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:32,454
into,
but it's gotta be something that people 

1579
01:11:33,091 --> 01:11:33,924
connect to that you can do for 20 
minutes straight without looking at a 

1580
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:38,640
script.
So shoe.

1581
01:11:38,641 --> 01:11:39,151
Nice.
Do you know?

1582
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:39,984
Sure.
Nice.

1583
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:40,741
Oh,
he's a legend.

1584
01:11:40,741 --> 01:11:44,780
He eats yoder and chase's alcohol.
So he made that.

1585
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:49,790
I've heard of him actually.
He made a asm are eating chips video.

1586
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:52,380
Okay.
He just eats chips.

1587
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:53,933
All right,
well I'm going to do an answer more of 

1588
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:57,270
drinking Tito's and soda.

1589
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,980
Hmm.
I'm going to do this.

1590
01:11:58,981 --> 01:11:59,940
I'm not even joking.
I'm doing,

1591
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,240
I don't want to do one role play.
I'm trying to think of like,

1592
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,610
oh my,
my Tito's.

1593
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:08,190
Okay.
Mine would be talking to a stewardess on

1594
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:11,460
a flight or like going and she's cutting
me off,

1595
01:12:11,461 --> 01:12:14,860
but I'm trying to get myself at off.
Hey,

1596
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:18,090
I'm so sorry.
Am I talking loud out there?

1597
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:20,693
The guy next to me,
he's a doctor and he's trying to get me 

1598
01:12:21,961 --> 01:12:23,910
bills.
I'm afraid of flying.

1599
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:27,270
Oh my God,
that is fun.

1600
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,560
That is insane.
God,

1601
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:30,740
I've been wanting to do an smr for a 
long time,

1602
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,410
but I haven't done it.

1603
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,720
If it's just so funny,
so fertile,

1604
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:36,690
it's,
I,

1605
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:40,670
I feel like this is going to sound 
almost sociopathic.

1606
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,470
I feel like it's something you just 
gotta do a lot of to see you get better,

1607
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,630
get better and better for Christ the 
mark.

1608
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,460
Hey guys,
it can be anything at all.

1609
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:51,860
I think it's,
I thought you said challenge and I think

1610
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:53,890
I like the birth,
Christ your ass.

1611
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,300
Some more challenge where people ask 
them all as me,

1612
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:01,190
they're getting character is me and do 
smrs for 20 minutes as Bert in different

1613
01:13:01,191 --> 01:13:02,400
scenarios.
Jesus,

1614
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:04,070
I like that.
The bird crazy.

1615
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,810
Calling it out now guys,
the Berg crazier as smr.

1616
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:07,813
Uh,
one's me trying to get them to open the 

1617
01:13:09,441 --> 01:13:13,850
door at Mcdonald's.
Hey,

1618
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:17,780
over here.
Okay.

1619
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,700
Um,
so why did you guys close?

1620
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:22,340
Yeah,
maybe food back there.

1621
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:27,460
Cause usually closet.
Tell my 15 what is this is the deal

1622
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:28,990
web of,
of uh,

1623
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:34,440
apparently relaxing.
Some is already giving me anxiety,

1624
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,040
buck land that,

1625
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:45,080
so that's like a whole horror genre,
right?

1626
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,093
So for those who can't see,
I don't know how to describe it as 

1627
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:52,863
creepy,
Matt.

1628
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:55,610
It's a bird mask,
but it's like a,

1629
01:13:55,611 --> 01:13:59,390
it's like a steam punk bird mask.
Creepy Shit.

1630
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:00,733
And he's got potions all on a top hat.
I was trying to think how to describe 

1631
01:14:04,551 --> 01:14:09,440
those potions with white gloves on.
And a bow tie looks like,

1632
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:11,980
uh,
a cedar at a nice with

1633
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,580
a leather white leather steam punk mask.
Right.

1634
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:18,010
Thank you.
That was very well described.

1635
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,720
I,
I watch this one a lot.

1636
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:21,610
Yeah.
So there's that.

1637
01:14:21,611 --> 01:14:23,020
But then there's,
there's ones,

1638
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:28,021
they're really popular.
Asm are kidnapping roleplay and this one

1639
01:14:28,901 --> 01:14:32,290
features a dude,
which is a band like Alex Jones.

1640
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:35,620
They banned Alex Jones and they've got 
ass kidnap rope.

1641
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:37,840
I mean it,
it's kind of like a rape fantasy.

1642
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,180
Like this is the one that the women 
watch.

1643
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:45,870
If I'm being frank,
400,000

1644
01:14:46,211 --> 01:14:51,211
views,
we ended up,

1645
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:56,980
there's a guy with a beer,
he's holding a knife,

1646
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:59,270
he's grabbing the camera like he's 
caressing your face.

1647
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,340
Oh flag his video.

1648
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:05,230
He got into this way.
I can always be me and girl pick one new

1649
01:15:05,231 --> 01:15:06,064
sister.
I can even understand what all a mask 

1650
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:12,740
and I get like a lunatic years.
People are loving.

1651
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:15,550
What are the,
what are the comments though?

1652
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:18,340
Like the like ratio is really good.
Is it?

1653
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,233
Yeah.
He's only gotten 214 dislikes for the 

1654
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:27,880
lever.
Very good acting.

1655
01:15:27,881 --> 01:15:29,120
I would,
I don't know.

1656
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:32,980
I don't know if it's great acting.
Funny Story.

1657
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:35,900
Brilliant.
So well thought out and about as real as

1658
01:15:35,901 --> 01:15:37,450
you guys again.
So are people just,

1659
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,880
is it like a lot of experience while 
they chill?

1660
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:41,770
I don't know man.
It's a smart baby.

1661
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,780
It's a whole brave new world.
I liked it.

1662
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:45,260
It's all done whispering.
Yeah.

1663
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,193
It's almost like,
like it like takes out the acting part 

1664
01:15:48,821 --> 01:15:49,810
of it and just like,
oh,

1665
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:50,644
just whispered hall.
I felt like there's gotta be people who 

1666
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:53,260
hate whispering.

1667
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:55,420
Right.
It doesn't bother me.

1668
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:59,080
I know you are not a fan of the whisper.
You don't like whispering?

1669
01:15:59,081 --> 01:16:01,480
No.
And you don't like that.

1670
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:03,040
I totally get,
you know,

1671
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:03,874
one time I was with,
I was dating a girl in college and I 

1672
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:09,550
thought things were going really well.
She was,

1673
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:10,683
I was,
I was into it and I thought she was 

1674
01:16:12,461 --> 01:16:14,140
really into it too.
It was going great.

1675
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,320
And I'm hanging out in her dorm room.
This is freshman year.

1676
01:16:17,321 --> 01:16:20,350
We were in the dorms and we're hanging 
out just the two of us.

1677
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,570
And I just,
and I never do this.

1678
01:16:22,571 --> 01:16:23,404
I don't know why it did,
but I just call it like that and she 

1679
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:29,950
fucking snapped and like never talked to
me again.

1680
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,620
She goes,
excuse me,

1681
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:36,490
can you please never do that again?
And I was like,

1682
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:38,090
Whoa,
yeah,

1683
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:39,983
I want to to get a horse,
the diamond and I and I so that I know 

1684
01:16:43,691 --> 01:16:45,570
you don't like it but not,
and I was,

1685
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,440
that was one of my crazy female 
interactions and quality,

1686
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:52,090
insane.
Like I thought it was going great.

1687
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:54,160
Like I thought we are.
We were really hitting it off.

1688
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:56,770
All it took was one of these,
my wife,

1689
01:16:56,771 --> 01:17:00,130
it's pulling her ponytail.
You pulled my wife's ponytail.

1690
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:01,240
What happened?
Like two,

1691
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,670
eight irrational place.
Here's the kicker.

1692
01:17:03,671 --> 01:17:05,910
You Ready?
Her Dad pulls her ponytail,

1693
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,530
all the tongue.
It shouldn't say a fucking word.

1694
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:10,090
And I went,
I

1695
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:10,920
can analyze that.
I,

1696
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,060
while we were in Alabama and her dad 
came up and said,

1697
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:16,610
what's up frog and pull the ponytail.
And she went,

1698
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:18,240
Oh Daddy.
And then,

1699
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:20,630
and then I went up.
I went up like a minute later,

1700
01:17:20,631 --> 01:17:22,500
I was like,
what's up frog and porter buddy,

1701
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:24,560
don't do it.
I don't ever fucking do that again.

1702
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:26,600
And I went,
he just did the same thing.

1703
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:27,530
She goes,
it's very different.

1704
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:28,380
Very different.
And I went,

1705
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:30,530
okay.
Wow.

1706
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,900
You do not pull my wife's ponytail.
Have you got,

1707
01:17:32,901 --> 01:17:34,170
have you tried to undo?
Oh,

1708
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,220
have you tried to understand that?
No,

1709
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,910
I think that she wasn't allowed to have,
I mean,

1710
01:17:39,911 --> 01:17:40,160
yeah,
my,

1711
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:40,993
her dad is not watching this.
I don't think she was allowed to have a 

1712
01:17:42,201 --> 01:17:43,034
voice with her dad.
And I think that because she was afraid 

1713
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:47,930
he'd leave because her mom bailed on 
her.

1714
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,513
She was,
it wasn't,

1715
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:53,480
she was right and she didn't like it,
but she couldn't vocalize that.

1716
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:55,970
And then when she feels safe with you,
she vocalizes it.

1717
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:57,320
Like,
what's a compliment?

1718
01:17:57,321 --> 01:17:58,910
Really,
when we all go to dinner,

1719
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:02,720
I want you to just call her my wife,
her ponytail and see if she vocalizes it

1720
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:03,710
to you.
And then I'll just do it.

1721
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,450
Were like right after you can see her 
lose her shit.

1722
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,330
So you're,
so when we go out to dinner,

1723
01:18:08,331 --> 01:18:11,060
you're inviting me to pull,
your wife's just pawn it and just go,

1724
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:13,580
what's up frog?
What's up frog?

1725
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,000
I think I get punched in the face.
She's slow.

1726
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:17,990
She said,
well,

1727
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,823
yeah,
she's gotten a lot slower the older 

1728
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:20,594
she's gotten recently.
I was amazed to find out that you 

1729
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,070
completed a triathlon.
I know,

1730
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:35,600
I mean like you don't see his eyes go 
right to my belly.

1731
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:38,630
Literally went like that was a me too 
moment.

1732
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,910
He just went.
You don't look,

1733
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:45,830
you look like,
I mean not totally in shape,

1734
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:47,420
right?
Not,

1735
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:49,010
not totally in shape.
No.

1736
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:50,803
I am definitely out of shape.
But like you also on one hand did a 

1737
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:56,720
triathlon.
So can you be at both things?

1738
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:58,550
I think so.
I think,

1739
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:03,440
I think I am the most in shape out of 
shape guy in the world.

1740
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:05,480
Like I ran,
it started with,

1741
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:06,860
uh,
it started with,

1742
01:19:06,861 --> 01:19:09,050
I ran the La Marathon with no training 
at all.

1743
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,820
How many miles was that?
26.2

1744
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:14,370
what will,
how did you place uh,

1745
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,440
not,
I mean good rent,

1746
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,020
five hours and 33 minutes.
So,

1747
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:20,870
but not like great,
but average is that about average?

1748
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:21,943
I think average is like probably for 
four hours and 30 minutes or say you 

1749
01:19:25,311 --> 01:19:28,490
were,
you were almost untrained dog training.

1750
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,800
I can't,
I can barely run around the block,

1751
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:31,280
dude.

1752
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,091
I,
well,

1753
01:19:32,091 --> 01:19:36,200
what happened was run around the block.
We did that sober October challenge me,

1754
01:19:36,201 --> 01:19:37,034
Rogan,
Tom and Ari and we finished it and we 

1755
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:41,271
were all,
you know,

1756
01:19:41,271 --> 01:19:42,104
I felt brave.
I had a little bravado cause I'd just 

1757
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:46,640
not drank or done drugs for a month and 
so I'm like,

1758
01:19:46,641 --> 01:19:47,474
I can do anything.
And then when we all get drunk on Joe's 

1759
01:19:49,671 --> 01:19:52,520
podcast,
and I said very confidently,

1760
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:56,300
I could definitely run a marathon with 
no training and everyone,

1761
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:57,920
Joe,
in all fairness,

1762
01:19:57,921 --> 01:20:00,050
Joe was the voice of reason and he was 
like,

1763
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,150
I think you could do it.
I think it would hurt,

1764
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,950
but I don't think you could do it under 
five hours.

1765
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,330
I go,
I can do it on a five hours.

1766
01:20:05,331 --> 01:20:06,920
And Ari was like,
oh you couldn't.

1767
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:07,943
My Dad doerries dad is a holocaust 
survivor and 80 years old and he had 

1768
01:20:11,761 --> 01:20:13,020
done it in like six hours.

1769
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,600
Well I've,
I can definitely beat your dad.

1770
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:15,434
He's 80 Ari.
But how did you know that you could do 

1771
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:18,540
that?
Because like I said,

1772
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,420
I am,
I cannot run around the block.

1773
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:24,450
I didn't do you run like how can I run 
like a,

1774
01:20:24,451 --> 01:20:27,300
like a regular person would?
I'm not like a long list.

1775
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:28,453
Go for runs.
I tried to do it often but like three 

1776
01:20:31,021 --> 01:20:32,820
miles,
there's a lower east side.

1777
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,833
Well how are you,
if you're running through miles 

1778
01:20:35,011 --> 01:20:35,844
regularly,
how are you still so in shape I drink a 

1779
01:20:40,531 --> 01:20:42,390
lot.
I think I drink a lot is what the number

1780
01:20:42,391 --> 01:20:46,140
one thing and so,
but so then I said I could do it.

1781
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:49,590
So I signed up the La Marathon,
no training other than regular,

1782
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:51,240
just like I didn't do it parents on 
plan.

1783
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,313
I just basically jogged whenever I felt 
like jogging and I didn't jog when I 

1784
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:56,070
didn't want to jog or drank the night 
before,

1785
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:59,030
showed up,
no training and I was bragging about it.

1786
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,380
I was like,
in line on instagram stories is going to

1787
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:02,910
trade for this.
I was like not me.

1788
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:05,820
And then I ran it and I just jogged the 
whole way.

1789
01:21:05,821 --> 01:21:09,840
At 22 miles my calves seized up.
My Quad sees dot.

1790
01:21:09,841 --> 01:21:11,460
Oh Mike and the woman in front of me,
Shit,

1791
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:13,650
her pants and I was like,
oh,

1792
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,010
I saw her and she was like a an 
executive.

1793
01:21:17,011 --> 01:21:17,844
She'll be like,
and it was like a bandaid went down one 

1794
01:21:20,221 --> 01:21:23,940
leg up one cheek and everyone started 
falling off like zombies.

1795
01:21:23,941 --> 01:21:24,631
I was like,
Oh,

1796
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:27,480
this is why you train.
And then I finished it.

1797
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:29,143
And so then,
and so then men's health came to me and 

1798
01:21:30,271 --> 01:21:31,170
they were like,
uh,

1799
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:33,390
you can find the trailer if you want to 
watch a trailer.

1800
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:34,224
That's all my instagram.
You can see the trailer of this men's 

1801
01:21:36,361 --> 01:21:36,870
health came to me.

1802
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:39,870
And they're like,
they're like very candidly,

1803
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:42,900
they're inspirational people online like
dinner,

1804
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:43,763
like,
like,

1805
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:45,990
like cameron hanes and David Goggins 
and,

1806
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:48,720
and Jocko will nick and,
and Peter Attia,

1807
01:21:48,721 --> 01:21:51,210
all these guys who were like ultra 
marathon swimmers,

1808
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,910
navy seals,
a ultra marathon runners.

1809
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:54,880
You know,
these,

1810
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,530
these guys were just amazing individuals
and they are inspiring to me.

1811
01:21:58,531 --> 01:22:00,000
I'm inspired by every single one of 
them.

1812
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:01,800
I watched them and I listen to them and 
I go,

1813
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:04,110
I think they're sayings when I don't 
want to do stuff.

1814
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:05,483
And they're like,
but I think a lot of people see those 

1815
01:22:06,481 --> 01:22:06,731
and go,
well,

1816
01:22:06,731 --> 01:22:07,564
I'll never be able to do that.
And then they go and then we see you do 

1817
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,210
it and you're like,
uh,

1818
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,680
accessible to the average guy.
So men's health is like,

1819
01:22:13,681 --> 01:22:15,420
we want to follow you do another 
marathon.

1820
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:16,254
I'm like,
I'm never doing another marathon as 

1821
01:22:17,311 --> 01:22:17,400
well.

1822
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,110
I'm done.
That was the dumbest thing I ever did.

1823
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:20,700
And they're like,
what do you want to do?

1824
01:22:20,701 --> 01:22:22,380
I was like,
I've always wanted to do a triathlon.

1825
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:23,970
And they're like,
well get your triathlon coach,

1826
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:27,540
we'll get you a nutritionist.
Which everything you prepared.

1827
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:30,540
Well Kinda,
I rode my bike once.

1828
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,370
I bought a really nice bike by road at 
once.

1829
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:35,340
Make sure I knew how to work the gears.
Uh,

1830
01:22:35,341 --> 01:22:37,710
I ran on treadmills.
I didn't really run in the open road too

1831
01:22:37,711 --> 01:22:40,170
much,
but I know and then I just,

1832
01:22:40,171 --> 01:22:42,500
and then I did the swim.
I slowly,

1833
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:43,343
thing I did was swimming,
but I didn't even spend that much 

1834
01:22:44,701 --> 01:22:46,680
because like,
I mean technically because I,

1835
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:49,290
my marathon,
my triathlon coach saw me swim once.

1836
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:50,011
He was like,
you're a swimmer,

1837
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:52,510
you'll be fine.
You are looking at lead athlete.

1838
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:56,370
Can someone please isolate that audio to
me from my phone?

1839
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,960
I swear to God,
Dude came up to Penn Center.

1840
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:03,600
I've run a marathon at traffic and a 
half marathon and a spartan race,

1841
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,090
and even less formal than,
Oh,

1842
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:05,943
this guy,
oh,

1843
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:08,470
this guy's a fucking psycho.
I don't know what he's,

1844
01:23:08,471 --> 01:23:10,540
he's just a pathological liar.
Oh No,

1845
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:12,880
I don't want to even believe it.
It's all on instagram.

1846
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:13,481
Oh,
I did it.

1847
01:23:13,481 --> 01:23:14,500
I know.
I've seen it.

1848
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,800
Here's what's crazy is that,
that unbelievable part of me was like,

1849
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,250
partly so to finish the triathlon story,
there were,

1850
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,270
they were,
um,

1851
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:25,270
they were like,
my triathlon coach was like,

1852
01:23:25,271 --> 01:23:27,690
all right,
we're ballparking it like diabetes.

1853
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:31,560
Like if you can,
if you can do the triathlon and an hour,

1854
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:32,950
45 minutes.
He was like,

1855
01:23:32,951 --> 01:23:35,380
that's why I think your goal should be 
doing an hour and 45.

1856
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:38,860
But then I got out there and I got 
competitive and almost died.

1857
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,630
I got into the swim and I was like in 
fourth place.

1858
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,690
And I'm like,
I'm like,

1859
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:42,911
yeah.
And I'm like,

1860
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:44,140
what are,
these guys are idiots.

1861
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:45,303
And then I,
and then all of a sudden this Chinese 

1862
01:23:46,211 --> 01:23:47,044
guy jumped on my back and sunk me and I 
breathed in water and then everyone 

1863
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:50,704
started climbing over and over top.
He's like a fucking mosh pit instead of 

1864
01:23:52,931 --> 01:23:56,200
freaking out a hundred feet of water,
400 yards from the shore.

1865
01:23:56,201 --> 01:23:57,034
And I'm just like,
I get it up on my back and we're like 

1866
01:24:00,611 --> 01:24:04,020
this for like 200 yards of the shit.
They're just selling the zone there.

1867
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:08,050
It's a competition.
And this is there something at stake?

1868
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,500
It was trying to get you out of the way 
yet?

1869
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:10,991
No.
Yeah.

1870
01:24:10,991 --> 01:24:13,170
Basically you're in their way and they 
just climb all over you.

1871
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:15,130
Is it,
is there a prize?

1872
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,510
No prize and no problem.

1873
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:17,343
Competitive.
Just come up how to live love for the 

1874
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:18,940
game.
Yeah.

1875
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:21,880
And so I finished,
I got out of the water and like eight,

1876
01:24:21,881 --> 01:24:22,691
10 minutes,
I think,

1877
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:24,010
eight minutes.
Um,

1878
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:25,990
I don't know because I didn't stop my 
watch at the right moment.

1879
01:24:25,991 --> 01:24:26,824
I stopped the watch.
Smoked after your near drowning 

1880
01:24:28,001 --> 01:24:30,070
experience did,
but then I got my shit together.

1881
01:24:30,071 --> 01:24:30,904
Trust me.
There was a moment where almost waved 

1882
01:24:31,511 --> 01:24:34,180
the lifeguard,
like I know that serious,

1883
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:35,890
they're all right there.
And you could just be like,

1884
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:37,630
just do you hold onto your board for 
like a while,

1885
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:40,230
like just talk.
Just give me the sign.

1886
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:41,770
They were,
if there were kids,

1887
01:24:41,771 --> 01:24:43,420
there were children's just sitting on a 
board,

1888
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:45,770
you have to be rescued by some child on 
a,

1889
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,260
and I was like,
that's not happening.

1890
01:24:47,261 --> 01:24:49,880
So I got on my back and I back peddled 
like back,

1891
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:52,030
swam for a second,
and then I flipped over,

1892
01:24:52,031 --> 01:24:54,460
finished the swim in like 10 minutes,
eight minutes,

1893
01:24:54,461 --> 01:24:56,410
10 minutes,
got on the bike.

1894
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,341
And I was like,
Oh,

1895
01:24:57,341 --> 01:24:59,410
I'm smoking dudes.
But then I go to the uphill and they all

1896
01:24:59,411 --> 01:25:02,390
just pass me.
I was like gassed out from home hall now

1897
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:07,050
uphill by a Frizz lock up hill dude.
And I,

1898
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:08,403
and I'm so impressed I can in the 
triathlon in an hour 21 instead of an 

1899
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:14,080
hour 45.
And they were like,

1900
01:25:14,081 --> 01:25:15,470
what?
Anyway,

1901
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,350
here's fuck.
Are you an athlete?

1902
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:20,710
You're an athletic guy.
I'm an athletic guy.

1903
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:21,730
Okay,
baseball.

1904
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,650
Um,
but here's the thing,

1905
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:25,420
that position Catcher,
left field,

1906
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:28,100
third base,
monster hitter power of it.

1907
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:30,400
I bet.
What was about a third but not like,

1908
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,740
I mean I guess I was bigger than 
everyone else usually,

1909
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:34,050
but yeah,
no,

1910
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:35,283
I mean got recruited to go to college 
and then went to Florida state to walk 

1911
01:25:37,781 --> 01:25:38,970
on up.
Okay.

1912
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:39,700
And then,
uh,

1913
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,010
went to one practice and was like,
this is not for me.

1914
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:43,420
Look,
catch bullpens.

1915
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:44,950
I walked,
I'm not even joking.

1916
01:25:44,951 --> 01:25:48,160
I walked off that field out the left 
field fence,

1917
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:51,580
went straight over to my dorm Sally Hall
Room one 11,

1918
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:52,990
went in Chile.
Really?

1919
01:25:52,991 --> 01:25:56,800
Paul piece of Chandler pair of,
we're all in the room just getting high.

1920
01:25:56,801 --> 01:25:57,634
We used to this thing called time 
traveling where we'd blackout all the 

1921
01:25:59,651 --> 01:26:01,800
windows,
play pink floyd and lay on the ground,

1922
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:05,060
smoke weed and just time travel.
And I was like,

1923
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:05,983
I'm done baseball.
I think I'm at a party professionally 

1924
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:11,350
and listen to pink floyd.
Just that welcome to the moon.

1925
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,440
And,
but here's the thing that I believe,

1926
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:17,150
right?
Casey Neistat,

1927
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:20,630
a very interesting guy.
Very polarizing.

1928
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:21,703
Sometimes as a fan he can be polarizing.
I know you worked with them and you're 

1929
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:25,850
friends with them,
but like,

1930
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,090
yeah,
I'm a fan of his for years now.

1931
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,283
Um,
he said something that just stuck with 

1932
01:26:32,841 --> 01:26:34,820
me,
like stuck so heavy with me.

1933
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:36,103
He was,
someone was asking him about snapchat 

1934
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,730
and he goes,
I do snapchat the way I do everything.

1935
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,440
Tell a story,
tell a story.

1936
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:43,880
Just to have a beginning,
middle,

1937
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:44,714
and an end.
And I went and I didn't understand 

1938
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:48,320
snapchat at the time and I was like,
oh,

1939
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:49,723
okay.
So when instagram stories came out and 

1940
01:26:51,021 --> 01:26:53,360
that was more accessible for me and my 
fan base,

1941
01:26:53,361 --> 01:26:57,500
I think I went,
what I'll do is I'll find ways to tell a

1942
01:26:57,501 --> 01:26:59,510
story.
So I'll do a half marathon,

1943
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:02,540
I'll do a spartan race,
I'll do a triathlon or do a marathon,

1944
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,570
I'll go to Paris,
I'll go to eh,

1945
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,070
I've taken on tour,
I'm doing a theater tour,

1946
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:09,500
come follow my story and then have a 
beginning,

1947
01:27:09,501 --> 01:27:11,360
middle and end,
like you find me and I,

1948
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:15,110
that is how I use instagram stories.
And so someone like a triathlon,

1949
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,100
I find that fun.

1950
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,100
I mean,
my interaction was like through the roof

1951
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:21,050
that day.
And then people are like,

1952
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:22,153
I'm going in and like going into 
American Airlines to check in for my 

1953
01:27:24,381 --> 01:27:26,060
flight and the girl,
the lady checking me and is like,

1954
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,740
hey,
how was it traveler?

1955
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:28,900
And you're like,
oh,

1956
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:29,661
it's just like,
hi,

1957
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:33,650
I love your stories.
So I think that is how I use instagram.

1958
01:27:33,651 --> 01:27:38,651
And then I use the feed part for like 
that one big promo I shoot or you know,

1959
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:40,533
so,
but,

1960
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,413
but so I'm going to,
I'm going to Paris next week just on a 

1961
01:27:43,521 --> 01:27:46,100
lark because I was like fuck it.
A lark,

1962
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,140
just like a global venture.
Yeah.

1963
01:27:48,141 --> 01:27:48,620
Cause I was like,
oh,

1964
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:50,660
we've got a special to promote and lark 
and I have,

1965
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,030
it's just like pen.
Yeah.

1966
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:56,300
On a whim.
Santana spon spontaneous idea.

1967
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,480
I had a weekend off and I was like,
and I was like,

1968
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:01,430
I was like,
I'm going to probably be doing press.

1969
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:03,860
And I was like in New York.
And then part of me is like,

1970
01:28:03,861 --> 01:28:05,210
you know what,
I'll just go to Paris.

1971
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,610
That you're feeling adventurous.
Yeah,

1972
01:28:06,611 --> 01:28:07,444
no.
And I'll put it on my stories and then 

1973
01:28:08,091 --> 01:28:08,924
people can follow me in Paris and eat my
way through Paris and drink my way into 

1974
01:28:10,821 --> 01:28:13,200
the night and then find out where I stay
and the,

1975
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:13,881
you know,
I was like,

1976
01:28:13,881 --> 01:28:14,720
fuck it.
Why not?

1977
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:15,910
You know?
It's like,

1978
01:28:15,911 --> 01:28:16,521
wait,
what happened?

1979
01:28:16,521 --> 01:28:18,860
I asked this weekend where you guys go 
in Santa Cruz,

1980
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:21,620
Santa Cruz.
It's my favorite place.

1981
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:26,030
We lived there together for a year.
Real love that place now.

1982
01:28:26,031 --> 01:28:29,190
Do you guys turn off your professional 
life when you go do,

1983
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:30,940
oh,
really?

1984
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:34,700
Last time we were there we were shooting
in blog and it's like,

1985
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:35,973
yeah,
it's always kind of like you're half 

1986
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:38,083
basically with that.
That's why I stopped doing the mind is 

1987
01:28:39,891 --> 01:28:43,280
occupied with like when's that good shot
coming?

1988
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:45,380
That's why Casey,
I,

1989
01:28:45,381 --> 01:28:47,810
it's I,
it's what I think about Casey Neistat is

1990
01:28:47,811 --> 01:28:51,110
like when he stopped doing his blog,
I was like,

1991
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:52,123
thank God,
because he seems like he has a really 

1992
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:54,794
cool life,
but I know that he's not getting to 

1993
01:28:56,211 --> 01:28:58,760
taste it because when he's getting into 
a helicopter,

1994
01:28:58,761 --> 01:29:02,490
he's also thinking of as an exterior 
shot is his entry shot.

1995
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:03,690
Yes.
Drone shot.

1996
01:29:03,691 --> 01:29:06,110
He's got all these Shari angles.
Yeah.

1997
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:11,150
I mean that we've gone through that and 
that's why we pretty much stopped making

1998
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:15,030
videos on our main channel and really,
I mean we don't,

1999
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:18,000
we haven't posted there in a long time 
and we just kind of one day we're like,

2000
01:29:18,001 --> 01:29:22,110
we can't sustain this anymore.
It's too hard.

2001
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:23,940
My daughter,
you'll hear my daughter say stuff like,

2002
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:26,070
everything doesn't need to go on 
Instagram,

2003
01:29:26,071 --> 01:29:27,180
dad.
And you're just like,

2004
01:29:27,181 --> 01:29:28,010
yeah,
but you,

2005
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:28,570
well,
it's a,

2006
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:30,030
it's about your relationship with it.

2007
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:33,120
If it doesn't bother you,
if you're excited and it's fun for you,

2008
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:35,780
that's then that's wholesome and good.
But for,

2009
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:36,660
for,
for us,

2010
01:29:36,661 --> 01:29:37,494
and I'm sure for Casey to where it's 
like it feels bad and you're aware that 

2011
01:29:42,451 --> 01:29:43,284
it feels bad and you don't want to be 
doing it and you're anxious and you're 

2012
01:29:45,001 --> 01:29:46,530
stressed all the time.
That's when it's bad.

2013
01:29:46,531 --> 01:29:48,870
But if you enjoy it,
then God bless.

2014
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:49,793
I love,
I loved when you guys did that like a 

2015
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,980
kosher or was it called when you switch?
Switch proper was called flip flop.

2016
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:58,410
When you guys do both to something for 
each other's channel.

2017
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,353
Oh,
colab,

2018
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:01,283
Colab,
colab.

2019
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:04,110
Whoa,
wait,

2020
01:30:04,111 --> 01:30:04,944
we did that.

2021
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:11,430
That was fun.
But like part of me was like,

2022
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:12,293
I wish someone else had a camera.
I wanted to see that points that you 

2023
01:30:15,181 --> 01:30:17,700
did.
I want to see what you guys didn't show.

2024
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:19,370
You know what I mean?
Like again,

2025
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:21,960
fascinating part for me.
That's what I love about podcasts.

2026
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:22,770
It's like,
yeah,

2027
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:25,280
you put your arm or down and you just 
share sometimes.

2028
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:27,540
So if you don't like from wiping,
you know,

2029
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:31,890
because those videos are so edited from 
two hours,

2030
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,130
you could go down to 10 minutes.
That's of course every time.

2031
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:36,000
Yeah.
And that's the current,

2032
01:30:36,001 --> 01:30:37,830
and that's why I love doing the show 
live too,

2033
01:30:37,831 --> 01:30:42,360
because it's like no take backs dude.
It's all out there dude.

2034
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,313
It makes you hold you accountable.
Here's what I also love about the 

2035
01:30:45,301 --> 01:30:47,460
podcast,
and I've said this a number of times,

2036
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,593
is that if you're watching this and 
listening and you hear something you're 

2037
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:51,693
offended by,
this is an extension of social media 

2038
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:54,623
share what offends you with the person 
creating it and explain to them why and 

2039
01:30:58,201 --> 01:31:01,050
help change their mind as opposed to 
like tattle tailing.

2040
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:04,300
Like I've said,
some fucked up stuff on my podcast,

2041
01:31:04,370 --> 01:31:08,100
legit across the board and my friends 
lawyers be like,

2042
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:11,400
Bro,
that that was like one hour,

2043
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:15,840
33 seconds,
20 to check what you got to really think

2044
01:31:15,841 --> 01:31:16,674
that it's,
I know that everyone's laughing in the 

2045
01:31:17,401 --> 01:31:20,430
room but it's not funny and you're like,
oh,

2046
01:31:20,431 --> 01:31:22,690
okay.
So I mean I've,

2047
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:23,933
I dude,
I was at the beginning of podcasting 

2048
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:27,720
when you could go out and say shit and 
ruin friendships,

2049
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:30,180
they ain't even know you were doing it.
You were just like,

2050
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:31,860
like what?
Like how would that happen?

2051
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:35,670
I mean there's this guy,
there's this comedian,

2052
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:36,553
oh,
say his name because I don't want to 

2053
01:31:36,781 --> 01:31:37,614
like put them on blast,
but he kind of like took a story from 

2054
01:31:40,801 --> 01:31:43,020
me.
And what does that mean?

2055
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:43,580
Like,
like,

2056
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:44,450
uh,
I,

2057
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,130
he was telling a story and he was,
when he was telling the story,

2058
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:48,143
he was saying that it happened to me and
he was telling him on stage who's thing 

2059
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,340
it having a bird habitat.

2060
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,450
And then one day Tom [inaudible],
we were all three friends.

2061
01:31:54,451 --> 01:31:55,530
Tom called me and he's like,
hey man.

2062
01:31:55,531 --> 01:31:57,390
And just so you know,
he's saying it happened to him.

2063
01:31:57,391 --> 01:31:58,224
No.
And he never really talked to me about 

2064
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:00,880
that and he just started doing it and 
thinking,

2065
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:03,130
and you guys were close friends?
We were pretty close.

2066
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:03,993
But that's pretty taboo at right.
I mean it was really taboo and I tried 

2067
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:08,614
to have a conversation with them and it 
was that a bit you want to do use 

2068
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:12,071
actually,
no,

2069
01:32:12,071 --> 01:32:15,220
that's what's problematic about it.
But the problem was I didn't,

2070
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:18,670
I almost really didn't want the bid out 
there because it was,

2071
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:20,470
it's a great story,
but it's,

2072
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:22,030
part of me was like,
you know what,

2073
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:23,133
the person that's involved in the story,
they may not remember that it happened 

2074
01:32:25,691 --> 01:32:26,524
to me.
They definitely don't know it didn't 

2075
01:32:27,401 --> 01:32:28,180
happen to you.

2076
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:30,820
But then when it comes back to me,
he's going to be like,

2077
01:32:30,821 --> 01:32:32,770
what?
And I'm going to look like an asshole.

2078
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:34,930
So I'd rather,
and if I decide to do,

2079
01:32:34,931 --> 01:32:36,700
decide to tell it,
I want to tell it on my timeline,

2080
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,230
I want to be the one to be able to tell 
it.

2081
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:41,650
I want to meet the guy that had happened
with and say again and go,

2082
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:43,870
hey man,
this story happened and this,

2083
01:32:43,871 --> 01:32:45,400
and it's a great story.
I won't tell you the story,

2084
01:32:45,401 --> 01:32:47,320
but I'd like to tell it on stage.
I need your blessing.

2085
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,303
That's how I go about it.
But this other guy just started saying 

2086
01:32:49,991 --> 01:32:50,824
it happened to him and then,
and then I went on Joe's podcasts and 

2087
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:54,703
was like,
and Joe just asked me about it and this 

2088
01:32:56,531 --> 01:32:58,960
is like,
this is probably like seven years ago,

2089
01:32:58,961 --> 01:33:00,180
eight years.
Whoa.

2090
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,073
And I just was like,
I just told him like the way we're 

2091
01:33:02,771 --> 01:33:03,940
talking right now.
And he's like,

2092
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:08,980
and I was unaware of how many people 
were listening and all of a sudden,

2093
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:11,860
and then it started a huge fight between
me and the guy.

2094
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:13,330
And then the guy just was like,
fuck you,

2095
01:33:13,331 --> 01:33:15,400
you're not my friend.
And I was like,

2096
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:16,503
it was just really confusing.
And I haven't spoken to the Chi since 

2097
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:20,381
Dan.
Yeah,

2098
01:33:20,381 --> 01:33:21,010
yeah,
yeah.

2099
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:21,980
So,
so that,

2100
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:24,520
but the,
I did that a couple people,

2101
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:28,150
I would just get drunk on a podcast and 
be honest.

2102
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:29,163
That's the killer I used to get.
I used to drink and I pretty much 

2103
01:33:32,471 --> 01:33:34,660
stopped just because it's like when 
you're live,

2104
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:38,830
you want to make sure that you're saying
what you mean.

2105
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:40,083
Yeah.
But I see I'm drunk so much that I'm 

2106
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:43,440
pretty bad cop.
I'm of,

2107
01:33:43,470 --> 01:33:44,530
I'm a flip tables.

2108
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:45,363
When I'm driving.
I remember that may have been the last 

2109
01:33:47,891 --> 01:33:49,250
time I drank for real.
No,

2110
01:33:49,310 --> 01:33:51,040
no,
there were a couple,

2111
01:33:51,041 --> 01:33:52,550
a couple in between.
I,

2112
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:54,930
I'm,
I'm pretty cool being drunk and I,

2113
01:33:54,931 --> 01:33:57,220
and still biting my tongue.
If I,

2114
01:33:57,221 --> 01:33:58,054
if I know it's going to hurt somebody,
but if it's about me or like my 

2115
01:34:00,431 --> 01:34:01,480
thoughts,
I'll just share them.

2116
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:02,913
And if I,
if they're messed up then I'll either 

2117
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:05,800
defend them or go,
yeah,

2118
01:34:05,801 --> 01:34:06,634
you're right.
I'm wrong.

2119
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:08,120
I'm totally wrong.
I fucked it up,

2120
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,360
you know,
but I drink a lot.

2121
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:11,830
What did the guy say?
What,

2122
01:34:11,831 --> 01:34:12,664
how did he,
how did he come to terms with having 

2123
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,170
stuff stole your bet?
He said,

2124
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:20,350
the last thing he said to me was,
um,

2125
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:21,663
you are a garbage human being piece of 
shit and you have no friends and you'll 

2126
01:34:26,111 --> 01:34:26,944
realize in a year that you'll have that 
I was the only friend you ever had and 

2127
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:33,670
you have no friends and uh,
he's like,

2128
01:34:33,671 --> 01:34:34,510
lose my number.

2129
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:36,550
I don't ever want to speak to you again.
You're dead to me.

2130
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:38,020
And I was like,
and by the way,

2131
01:34:38,021 --> 01:34:38,854
I like it.
It was so confusing at the time because 

2132
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,020
I thought,
I thought we were okay.

2133
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:45,460
Like I thought we were going to figure 
this out,

2134
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:46,443
you know,
like I thought we could figure all of 

2135
01:34:48,311 --> 01:34:51,430
this out and everyone was going to be 
fine and he just said that.

2136
01:34:51,431 --> 01:34:55,650
And at that point it was brother,
it was Christmas eve and like,

2137
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,510
and and I,
and I went on a hike up to the mountains

2138
01:34:59,511 --> 01:35:03,950
with my daughters and to the Hollywood 
sign and I got up there and I thought,

2139
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:05,413
I'm putting so much energy in trying to 
fix this when the guy doesn't want to 

2140
01:35:08,511 --> 01:35:10,880
fix it.
And to be honest with you,

2141
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:12,470
I go in and clear,
conscious,

2142
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:13,970
I didn't do anything wrong.

2143
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:15,770
And I was like,
I didn't do anything wrong.

2144
01:35:15,771 --> 01:35:17,300
And I was like,
I've got to let this go.

2145
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:20,480
This is Christmas Eve.
And I let it go that day.

2146
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:21,740
And I said,
my wife said to me,

2147
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:23,660
let it go right now.
Never.

2148
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:26,600
Don't talk to the about this for there.
There used to be,

2149
01:35:26,601 --> 01:35:27,434
I'll tell you,
there's a funny word we used to use to 

2150
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,580
about not talking about it.
And she's like,

2151
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:35,480
let it go now and just let it go.
And you can't be friends with him.

2152
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:37,520
He never talked to him again.
Just he's out of your life.

2153
01:35:37,521 --> 01:35:39,020
That's what it is.
That's what he wants.

2154
01:35:39,021 --> 01:35:40,700
That's what you want.
That's what you need.

2155
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,200
Then do it.
And I did just haven't spoken to him and

2156
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,850
that's good advice.
That's why it's hard to let go.

2157
01:35:46,851 --> 01:35:47,684
People go out of your life.
It's a breakup with a friend and be 

2158
01:35:49,671 --> 01:35:50,690
like,
hey man,

2159
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:54,230
we're not having fun anymore.
And cause to a dude,

2160
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,720
it sounds so weird.
I've broken up with dudes before.

2161
01:35:56,721 --> 01:35:58,570
My Buddy Eddie and I broken up three 
times.

2162
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:04,620
I broken up with guys before.
Well then that one,

2163
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,280
you know,
I guess,

2164
01:36:07,281 --> 01:36:09,140
I don't know,
was there a big breakup?

2165
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:10,843
I don't say it on the air.
Did I have a big male breakup that I 

2166
01:36:12,831 --> 01:36:13,664
don't remember.

2167
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:17,510
My Buddy Eddie and ally really 
interested.

2168
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:18,344
We've broken up a number of times and 
then he's also broken up with my buddy 

2169
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:21,734
Chris and S.
And so I remember one time going into 

2170
01:36:24,411 --> 01:36:26,030
Atlanta and being like,
Hey Chris,

2171
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:26,960
we should all hang out.
And he's like,

2172
01:36:26,961 --> 01:36:28,760
oh,
Eddie and I are on a break right now.

2173
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,073
Say That was like,
you don't think you guys could just get 

2174
01:36:32,721 --> 01:36:34,570
together for a weekend.
So we all hang out.

2175
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:35,510
It's like,
I don't know,

2176
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,550
maybe I'll see if we can get back 
together,

2177
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:41,990
but I am intrigued and I don't want to 
bring it up.

2178
01:36:41,991 --> 01:36:43,370
I'm just asking you this.
I'm intrigued by that.

2179
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,740
Did he ever come to terms with like,
he unders?

2180
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:46,341
He's like,
yes,

2181
01:36:46,341 --> 01:36:47,660
that was your story.
And I stole it.

2182
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:48,160
Yes.
He's,

2183
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,670
I think he's definitely come to terms 
with it.

2184
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:50,840
Did he ever apologize me?
Like,

2185
01:36:50,841 --> 01:36:52,550
I shouldn't have done that,
but you shouldn't have done that.

2186
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,590
We'd never spoken since.
I,

2187
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:55,663
we've,
we've,

2188
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:58,940
we at at a time had shared a manager and
we end a friend,

2189
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,980
uh,
and that manager tried to negotiate a,

2190
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:04,701
like,
almost like,

2191
01:37:04,701 --> 01:37:05,480
uh,
uh,

2192
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:08,270
getting back together.
But I had said,

2193
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:09,760
you know,
when that thing went down,

2194
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:10,603
I was like,
I can't,

2195
01:37:10,850 --> 01:37:11,683
I don't,
I'm done.

2196
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:12,523
I'm done,
done.

2197
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:14,540
And then I grew into like a different 
man,

2198
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:15,374
that guy I am today.
And I don't think I could ever go back 

2199
01:37:16,881 --> 01:37:18,240
to the guy that he knew.
Like she,

2200
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:19,123
I don't know if that would even work,
but I've seen him on twitter and 

2201
01:37:21,141 --> 01:37:21,974
instagram.
So every now and then and he seems like 

2202
01:37:22,821 --> 01:37:24,380
he's doing,
I'll say,

2203
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:25,910
all I'll say is,
and I don't know,

2204
01:37:25,911 --> 01:37:28,550
but it seems like he's doing very well 
and he seems like he's very happy.

2205
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:30,253
I feel like he's gone through a lot,
but I feel like he's found peace in his 

2206
01:37:33,081 --> 01:37:33,650
life.

2207
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:36,440
Like I saw him on a sincere,
I went flipped through his instagram the

2208
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,490
other day and I was like,
dude,

2209
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,230
I'm like,
I'm almost happy for him.

2210
01:37:39,231 --> 01:37:43,040
Like he seems like he's in so much of a 
better place than I ever knew him to be.

2211
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:44,840
And so,
and by the way,

2212
01:37:44,841 --> 01:37:46,280
it's,
I was going to ask,

2213
01:37:46,281 --> 01:37:48,750
did it affect his career?
Does a,

2214
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,840
I think a little bit,
I think a little bit.

2215
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:52,070
Uh,
but I think,

2216
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:53,623
I think that was just part of it.
I think some other stuff with him where 

2217
01:37:56,701 --> 01:37:59,250
he like,
I think just life got chaotic form for a

2218
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:02,910
second and he was joe focused on 
everything else that he didn't have time

2219
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:05,670
to focus on his career and then,
but he's doing fine.

2220
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:06,361
I mean he's,
you know,

2221
01:38:06,361 --> 01:38:07,320
he's,
he's working,

2222
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:08,820
everyone's working.
Yeah.

2223
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:11,530
Yeah.
I've,

2224
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:16,410
I've definitely said and done shit on 
this podcast that has haunted me onto me

2225
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:17,363
dude.

2226
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:18,170
When,
when,

2227
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:19,080
when we did,
I mean,

2228
01:38:19,081 --> 01:38:20,700
this is real,
like not,

2229
01:38:20,701 --> 01:38:21,190
I mean,
I'll tell,

2230
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:22,500
I don't care.
I'll tell it fucking anything.

2231
01:38:22,501 --> 01:38:24,510
Anyone.
The biggest mistake,

2232
01:38:25,110 --> 01:38:27,420
the biggest mistake I ever made in my 
life,

2233
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:27,801
like,
and,

2234
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:29,100
and I,
and it wasn't a mistake.

2235
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:30,750
It wasn't a mistake.
It was the right thing to do.

2236
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:34,290
But when we did the podcast where me 
Orient,

2237
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:39,180
tom decided to do sober October,
they asked me how much I drank and I sat

2238
01:38:39,181 --> 01:38:42,930
there for a second and I thought I was,
I remember where I was sitting.

2239
01:38:42,931 --> 01:38:43,764
I remember how I felt.
I remember where I looked because they 

2240
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:46,374
were sitting in a certain way and I 
looked to Tom who I knew would be the 

2241
01:38:49,411 --> 01:38:53,610
most empathetic and I thought,
I thought if you lie,

2242
01:38:53,611 --> 01:38:55,830
you're always going to be lying.
Just tell the truth.

2243
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:58,710
And I told him how many double Tito's 
and soda is I have in a day.

2244
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,530
And I look to Tom Knowing Joe wasn't 
gonna like the answer,

2245
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:04,140
he wasn't gonna like the answer.
And Tom looked at me like,

2246
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,630
oh,
what is that?

2247
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:10,670
What is it like on a night?
Like you go,

2248
01:39:12,391 --> 01:39:13,980
you got to bring one on stage,
you have another one.

2249
01:39:13,981 --> 01:39:15,730
And then a couple more after that.
And then like I,

2250
01:39:15,810 --> 01:39:16,643
whenever the answer,
I don't even know what the answer was 

2251
01:39:17,311 --> 01:39:18,840
anymore.
I don't even know what that right.

2252
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:20,250
But it was like,
it was a lot.

2253
01:39:20,251 --> 01:39:21,360
It was a lot.
Yeah.

2254
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:23,070
And I remember Tom just looking at me 
like,

2255
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:25,130
oh body.
He was like,

2256
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:30,380
he was like [inaudible] energy changed 
and he was like,

2257
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,043
wait,
hold on,

2258
01:39:34,290 --> 01:39:35,310
hold on,
hold on.

2259
01:39:35,530 --> 01:39:38,550
And I went in bed that night.
I got in bed that night and I was like,

2260
01:39:38,551 --> 01:39:41,850
Bro,
you should have never shown them the man

2261
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:43,490
behind the curtain.
Like I was like,

2262
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:48,500
why would you ever be honest since that 
day have did,

2263
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,033
was that,
did you know that people were gonna 

2264
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:51,780
react that way?

2265
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:52,613
Like I didn't.
Did you think that was somewhat normal 

2266
01:39:54,151 --> 01:39:55,610
amount to be drinking a day?
It just,

2267
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:57,240
it just got there.
He just got,

2268
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,420
there weren't any scale backs.
And so when we did sober October,

2269
01:40:00,421 --> 01:40:01,254
right,
I didn't drink for a month and then I 

2270
01:40:02,251 --> 01:40:03,084
went on a tear in November obviously.
But then what happened is I started 

2271
01:40:06,211 --> 01:40:07,044
getting rid of my specials.
I shot it in February and then I was 

2272
01:40:08,971 --> 01:40:12,090
like the biggest,
this is going to sound so fucking silly.

2273
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,730
The biggest thing I learned in,
uh,

2274
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:17,730
in after sober October was that I can go
to sleep sober.

2275
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,370
Like I don't need to like put myself to 
sleep.

2276
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:23,370
I could just go lay in a bed and go,
this will happen.

2277
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:24,950
Here we go,
here we go.

2278
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:27,690
You had this every night.
I had to have a drink.

2279
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:28,920
I'd have a drink to go to bed.

2280
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,900
I liked that it was the way I wrapped up
my night.

2281
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,130
All right guys,
let's have dinner.

2282
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:33,600
Only one open a bottle of wine.
Sure.

2283
01:40:33,601 --> 01:40:35,190
A bottle of wine.
Split a bottle of wine.

2284
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,690
She,
she'd have a glass.

2285
01:40:36,691 --> 01:40:39,530
I'd rip finish the rest and then I make 
a cocktail,

2286
01:40:39,531 --> 01:40:41,040
sit down,
watch TV and make another cocktail.

2287
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:42,510
She'd go to bed.
One more cocktail.

2288
01:40:42,511 --> 01:40:44,070
Fucking cigar.
No one hit her outside.

2289
01:40:44,071 --> 01:40:45,660
Like just,
and it was every,

2290
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:48,420
it was every night.
And then do you ever concerned that your

2291
01:40:48,421 --> 01:40:51,210
were growing in addiction?
No,

2292
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:53,760
I was way past that.
Like her wasn't worried about the idea.

2293
01:40:53,770 --> 01:40:54,521
I was like,
I was like,

2294
01:40:54,521 --> 01:40:56,170
we are where we are.
This is what I do for a living.

2295
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:57,850
This is why I'm a fly.
I party.

2296
01:40:57,870 --> 01:41:00,400
But then you quit cold Turkey for a 
whole month yet.

2297
01:41:00,401 --> 01:41:02,590
Well yeah and everyone was like,
you're going to have a stroke.

2298
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,520
And I was like,
what?

2299
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:06,560
And then I was like at eight dangerous,
if you're addicted now alcohol,

2300
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:10,090
I wasn't addicted.
Apparently the sound man alive if you do

2301
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:10,990
it,
but you got to do it.

2302
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:11,891
I mean I'm not,
look,

2303
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:12,724
I'm not a doctor.
I've seen documentaries of of alcohol 

2304
01:41:14,921 --> 01:41:15,754
addicts.
It's a special kind of like these guys 

2305
01:41:17,231 --> 01:41:21,220
drink whole bottles.
It's very different than that.

2306
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:22,083
Once again,
I'm not a doctor so anyone listening do 

2307
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:25,570
not listen to what I'm telling you just 
because it worked for me.

2308
01:41:25,571 --> 01:41:26,404
Do not.
You have a freak body that you run 

2309
01:41:27,761 --> 01:41:31,200
triathlons and drink drinks a day.
Shit,

2310
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,610
what happened is,
and so we did sober October and then all

2311
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,060
of a sudden you're like a successful 
shoot ice.

2312
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:37,500
You don't have no idea.

2313
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:40,803
You have an incredible body you adore 
and you achieve despite your efforts to 

2314
01:41:45,431 --> 01:41:48,880
just destroy your own body.
But yeah,

2315
01:41:48,881 --> 01:41:49,630
I didn't,
I didn't,

2316
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:51,910
I just quit drinking and then there was 
no,

2317
01:41:51,911 --> 01:41:55,630
like I felt no withdrawals.
I felt no really bounce back.

2318
01:41:55,631 --> 01:41:58,270
I just was like,
oh your blood.

2319
01:41:58,271 --> 01:42:00,910
And like I felt no need to drink.
I just was like,

2320
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:02,380
I was like animals.
Like DNA.

2321
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:04,090
It was a cool,
and then when I started drinking,

2322
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:06,430
I only started because we were in no new
orleans.

2323
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:09,070
And um,
I was with Ari and he's like,

2324
01:42:09,071 --> 01:42:10,840
let's get fucking drunk.
And where I was like,

2325
01:42:10,841 --> 01:42:13,960
cool,
and we've got a buzz gun and not drank a

2326
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:16,860
little bit.
But then in November I got the offer,

2327
01:42:16,861 --> 01:42:20,530
or like end of October I got the offer 
for Netflix and I was like,

2328
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,760
okay,
now I got to get to work.

2329
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:25,450
And so I just scaled back my drinking to
like,

2330
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,520
you know,
if I wanted to party I could party,

2331
01:42:27,521 --> 01:42:31,600
but I had to focus on the special right.
Didn't drink leading up to this special,

2332
01:42:31,601 --> 01:42:34,090
did the special and the La Marathon was 
around the corner.

2333
01:42:34,091 --> 01:42:36,040
It didn't drink going into that and 
then,

2334
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:37,990
and then like partied,
you know,

2335
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:39,130
but then was like,
oh,

2336
01:42:39,131 --> 01:42:40,440
triathlons coming up.
Not Drinking.

2337
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:41,680
Like I'm not drinking right now,
but,

2338
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,753
but,
but that's what's scary is I don't like 

2339
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,640
want to tell people like,
I'm not drinking.

2340
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:47,950
Like that's not me.
I drink if I want to drink.

2341
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:48,813
Like if I wanted to drink tonight,
I'm taking a car service down to Irvine 

2342
01:42:52,001 --> 01:42:54,010
and taking it back.
And in my head I'm like,

2343
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:54,873
all right,
should I drink tonight because I don't 

2344
01:42:55,751 --> 01:42:57,100
have to drive.
I was like,

2345
01:42:57,101 --> 01:42:57,934
I got two shows.
I wouldn't mind a cocktail on like a 

2346
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,690
late show when I start the machine 
story.

2347
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:02,913
And then I was like,
maybe I'll text my friend and see if we 

2348
01:43:03,890 --> 01:43:05,590
go for a bike ride a moment.
If we go for a bike ride,

2349
01:43:05,591 --> 01:43:06,424
I won't drink.
But I'm definitely drinking Saturday 

2350
01:43:07,511 --> 01:43:10,510
night because like we're taking a party 
bus down to Irvine.

2351
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,040
All our friends were on it and I'm going
to,

2352
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:14,230
I'm going to party on that.
I'm going to party back.

2353
01:43:14,231 --> 01:43:15,700
We're doing a screening of my special 
Ed.

2354
01:43:15,701 --> 01:43:17,620
My friend's house got a big screening 
room.

2355
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:19,690
I go and party is that day.
And then I was like,

2356
01:43:19,691 --> 01:43:20,524
I'm doing own Monday so I won't,
Marty like I'll probably scale back 

2357
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:25,530
early Sunday night.
But um,

2358
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:28,780
but I got on a red eye to New York.
I'm partying basically your whole week.

2359
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:32,403
But yeah,
I just look at what I can break and I 

2360
01:43:34,721 --> 01:43:35,261
go,
all right,

2361
01:43:35,261 --> 01:43:37,510
we got to know something good.
I wish,

2362
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:39,160
I wish I could go ahead.
Oh,

2363
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:43,270
I wish I enjoyed drinking.
I really do enjoy,

2364
01:43:43,271 --> 01:43:48,271
we'd either you see people smoking and 
they seem to enjoy it so much and when I

2365
01:43:48,281 --> 01:43:50,140
smoke,
all that happens to me.

2366
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,640
They say it happy,
hungry,

2367
01:43:52,641 --> 01:43:53,780
sleepy.
That's all happens.

2368
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:58,040
What happens to me is fucking paranoid,
depressed,

2369
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:01,490
gluttonous,
obsessive,

2370
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:04,160
obsessive,
panic attack.

2371
01:44:04,170 --> 01:44:09,170
He Oh miserable too.
And then people will be like,

2372
01:44:09,651 --> 01:44:10,820
you want him?
We're best friends.

2373
01:44:10,821 --> 01:44:13,040
We talk together.
And when you say no,

2374
01:44:13,041 --> 01:44:13,874
it's like such a disappointment.
It's like I don't want to blaze my best 

2375
01:44:18,231 --> 01:44:18,890
friend.
Right.

2376
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:21,770
Would it be great if they had fake weed 
where you could just hit it low,

2377
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:22,401
gritty,
anything.

2378
01:44:22,401 --> 01:44:27,040
But you had that moment of connection.
Like I like,

2379
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:30,080
I like like a nice one hitter of stuff 
that I've greenlit.

2380
01:44:30,110 --> 01:44:31,910
Like where I go to my own dispensary and
I go,

2381
01:44:31,911 --> 01:44:34,250
here's what I'm looking for.
I like that.

2382
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:37,370
But only like one hit.
And then what I do now,

2383
01:44:37,371 --> 01:44:38,204
I'm probably more of is I'll take,
I'll have a drink and then I'll take a 

2384
01:44:40,161 --> 01:44:43,250
one hitter and then I'm good.
Like I can relate to one.

2385
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:44,670
Oh,
you mix and mash.

2386
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:46,730
Just one hit of weed.
Yeah.

2387
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:48,590
That is what I enjoyed the most.
When I'm drawing,

2388
01:44:48,591 --> 01:44:50,000
it takes the edge off.
You see,

2389
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:56,900
I can't go because I to not go just 
wheat.

2390
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:59,700
That is my head.
You can just get high and go.

2391
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,630
That's why I don't get it.
I don't get it.

2392
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:05,270
And the only reason it's tolerable is 
because you're just,

2393
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:10,450
you're so drunk that you can't even eat 
edibles in my man cave one time.

2394
01:45:10,801 --> 01:45:12,280
But I,
there were little goldfish,

2395
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:13,280
right.
So I'm sitting there,

2396
01:45:13,281 --> 01:45:14,780
I'm hanging out and drinking,
and I was like,

2397
01:45:14,781 --> 01:45:15,460
fuck it.

2398
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:15,990
I'm not,
I'm,

2399
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:17,180
I'm,
I'm in that buzzed.

2400
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:18,680
I was like,
I got these edibles.

2401
01:45:18,681 --> 01:45:20,270
You know what?
I'm going to watch a cool movie.

2402
01:45:20,271 --> 01:45:22,780
And I eat the out of bulls,
barely shrinking.

2403
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:24,200
I'm like,
they're gonna put me to sleep.

2404
01:45:24,201 --> 01:45:27,290
And all of a sudden I feel my butthole 
melt into the couch.

2405
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:28,550
And I'm like,
okay,

2406
01:45:28,551 --> 01:45:30,440
something's going on.
Call my sisters.

2407
01:45:30,441 --> 01:45:30,921
I go,
hey,

2408
01:45:30,921 --> 01:45:32,740
how many of those goldfish should I have
had?

2409
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:35,150
They're like one and I go,
I the handful.

2410
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:37,250
Oh,
buckle up big boy.

2411
01:45:37,251 --> 01:45:40,160
You're in for a ride.
And I just where I was like,

2412
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:41,390
I was like,
whiskey,

2413
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:43,170
you got to beat him.
And I just thought,

2414
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,520
oh,
I wish.

2415
01:45:46,521 --> 01:45:48,470
I wish I could do that.
Oh,

2416
01:45:48,471 --> 01:45:50,840
not good.
I laid,

2417
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:53,160
I ended up in bed not forgetting how to 
breathe,

2418
01:45:55,110 --> 01:45:55,943
how to breathe.

2419
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:01,780
That's a story.
I was like,

2420
01:46:01,781 --> 01:46:02,614
two weeks.
We do this on her road or do we have to 

2421
01:46:03,581 --> 01:46:04,414
think it through?

2422
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:13,190
Yeah,
the joy of smoking weed.

2423
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:17,060
I don't want to chase.
I wished that I had something to unwind.

2424
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:19,670
I feel like I don't buy any hobbies.
Like I don't enjoy drugs.

2425
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:20,863
Does that what being depressed is?
That's what I wonder if stuff I say I 

2426
01:46:22,641 --> 01:46:24,800
don't enjoy anything.
Am I depressed?

2427
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:27,290
And the answer is probably yes.
Dude.

2428
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:28,700
Yes.
Idiot.

2429
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:30,350
You've been depressed.
See,

2430
01:46:30,351 --> 01:46:32,130
it's different.
See worked.

2431
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:32,990
Dot.
We're back.

2432
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:34,430
By the way.
This is Super Meta,

2433
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:37,280
but we're battling with something.
Our parents never had to battle.

2434
01:46:37,281 --> 01:46:39,680
Our parents never got to follow their 
dreams.

2435
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:43,490
So when they had a job at an insurance 
company or my dad was a lawyer,

2436
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:45,170
he then got off work.
It was like,

2437
01:46:45,171 --> 01:46:47,180
I hate that and I'm going to do what I 
love.

2438
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:49,320
I only do what I love.
So like,

2439
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:51,840
so like I'm like,
I had,

2440
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:54,390
my therapist was like,
you need a hobby.

2441
01:46:54,391 --> 01:46:56,040
I said,
I have a hobby at shooting of log.

2442
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:57,060
And he goes,
that's not a hobby.

2443
01:46:57,130 --> 01:46:59,370
So we'll know editing videos as a hobby 
goes,

2444
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,390
no,
I go writing jokes.

2445
01:47:00,391 --> 01:47:01,290
He's like,
that's not a hobby.

2446
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,050
Right?
I was like,

2447
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:04,350
I'm like making like writing scripts.
He's like,

2448
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:05,210
no.
Switching,

2449
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:06,910
nothing work related.
Yeah.

2450
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:11,960
And so I took up leather working,
making leather wallets and stuff,

2451
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:14,460
and then in the middle of doing it,
I'm like,

2452
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:15,450
I could sell these at my show.

2453
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,790
Yeah.
You can never escape.

2454
01:47:17,791 --> 01:47:18,830
I can't escape it.
It's like,

2455
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:19,673
you know,
when I had a desk job for five years 

2456
01:47:21,091 --> 01:47:23,370
before we read successful here and 
Israel.

2457
01:47:23,371 --> 01:47:26,310
Yeah.
Five fucking years marketing and like,

2458
01:47:26,311 --> 01:47:29,340
um,
I had the week,

2459
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:31,920
the workweek suck.
I fucking hated every second of it.

2460
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:34,470
When you those weekends on this night 
homes,

2461
01:47:34,471 --> 01:47:37,790
you see them closing my eyes because I'm
cherishing it so much worse.

2462
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:40,110
The lists,
the lists,

2463
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:40,973
dude,

2464
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:43,940
I said to someone,
and this is by the way,

2465
01:47:43,941 --> 01:47:47,290
this is hashtag first world problems.
I said this,

2466
01:47:47,291 --> 01:47:50,450
no one,
I would love to have a job where I built

2467
01:47:50,451 --> 01:47:53,740
fences and then I read my work there and
they're like,

2468
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:56,840
I bet you would love to build fences,
come home and be like,

2469
01:47:57,110 --> 01:47:59,540
who wants to go swimming?
But everyone was like,

2470
01:47:59,541 --> 01:48:00,430
dad's,
oh.

2471
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:02,390
And I didn't pull out instagram and be 
like,

2472
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:03,373
we're getting in the pool.
I got two shows in Irvine and I think 

2473
01:48:05,031 --> 01:48:08,180
it's like 30 days left the late show.
Like I would love to do that.

2474
01:48:08,181 --> 01:48:12,050
But then you go that guy building fences
and he's like,

2475
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:13,430
dude,
I've got a podcast.

2476
01:48:13,431 --> 01:48:14,960
It's a pie.
It's a passion project.

2477
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,430
It's my hobby.
And you're like,

2478
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:17,630
oh,
that's my job.

2479
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:22,790
I remember what I remember is those 
great weekends but,

2480
01:48:23,570 --> 01:48:24,403
but what I forget so easily is sitting 
eight hours soullessly and feeling the 

2481
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:34,370
minutes of your life take away down the 
drain.

2482
01:48:34,730 --> 01:48:39,320
You're finite energy,
your creative energy,

2483
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:44,920
the essence of who you are going down to
train every fucking minute.

2484
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:48,940
That's what I feel like on movie sets.
It's awful.

2485
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:53,030
It's really worth remembering.
I just sit there and I go,

2486
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:56,690
I am wasting fucking,
I'm not even good at this.

2487
01:48:57,110 --> 01:48:57,943
Why I'm here.
They want me to bring something 

2488
01:48:59,451 --> 01:49:00,670
original.
I'm just going to do it.

2489
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:02,210
I know what it felt like.
Dude.

2490
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:03,780
I cannot,
like,

2491
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:07,100
I wouldn't mind doing a multicam or it's
like burt walks in and they're like,

2492
01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:10,070
and they're like dad's home and you hear
the whole studio logs.

2493
01:49:14,330 --> 01:49:15,740
Right.
But I couldn't,

2494
01:49:15,770 --> 01:49:17,580
I couldn't,
I don't think I could.

2495
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:20,040
You have long days on set cause I've 
never been on set.

2496
01:49:20,041 --> 01:49:23,610
Like to that degree you just sit there 
like you just sit there,

2497
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:24,941
there.
I mean,

2498
01:49:24,941 --> 01:49:27,310
I guess like if you're someone creative 
like Dave Chappelle,

2499
01:49:27,311 --> 01:49:30,280
you probably write a script,
but like you multitask.

2500
01:49:30,370 --> 01:49:33,040
I can multitask.
I guess I don't multitask.

2501
01:49:33,041 --> 01:49:37,510
I just browse twitter and I'm like,
I'm like twitter.

2502
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:38,210
Okay.

2503
01:49:38,210 --> 01:49:43,210
Because my eyes like I get when I had 
literally sit by the lake

2504
01:49:44,090 --> 01:49:44,923
cause I fucking hate that I do that.
Like I'll wake up at eight and get out 

2505
01:49:47,291 --> 01:49:48,040
of bed at 10 and I'm

2506
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,400
like what is wrong with you are sick,
broke an hour.

2507
01:49:51,401 --> 01:49:52,234
I gave the other day my wife,
cause you did that for an hour and the 

2508
01:49:55,991 --> 01:49:59,200
worst part is like after 10 minutes 
you've seen everything.

2509
01:49:59,290 --> 01:50:01,150
Everything.
And by the way,

2510
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:02,283
I would love to switch phones and see 
what your discovery page looks like 

2511
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,940
because mine is like,
no,

2512
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:08,823
no,
I don't think you have boats and guys 

2513
01:50:10,661 --> 01:50:13,930
hitting golf balls.
Well here let me show you here.

2514
01:50:13,931 --> 01:50:16,690
Let's go discover.
I just have a trends for you.

2515
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:21,010
Oh John Mccain.
You don't see a John Mccain?

2516
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,780
No,
I see 200,000

2517
01:50:22,781 --> 01:50:25,660
tweets.
I see a woman on a motorcycle on them.

2518
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:28,050
Bobber wait,
are you on instagram or twitter?

2519
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:31,390
Instagram.
Instagram's weird,

2520
01:50:31,391 --> 01:50:32,260
man.
They they,

2521
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:35,590
they get weird on that.
Fairly based on what kind of embarrassed

2522
01:50:35,591 --> 01:50:36,424
to show you.
I didn't want anything with a cop 

2523
01:50:37,451 --> 01:50:39,490
getting this is a cop getting hit by a 
car.

2524
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:41,290
I watch a lot of um,
meat,

2525
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:44,230
like I'm obsessed with these Turkish 
chefs.

2526
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:48,070
They like cook crazy meat and like 
barbecue shit.

2527
01:50:48,071 --> 01:50:48,904
I'm really into barbecuing and cooking 
and there's like all these Turkish and 

2528
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:52,360
meet guys.
Dude,

2529
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:56,650
I have golfers all over my page.
I don't even really golf.

2530
01:50:56,710 --> 01:50:57,490
Like I,
I'm a,

2531
01:50:57,490 --> 01:50:59,050
I mean I can golf,
I golf,

2532
01:50:59,051 --> 01:51:01,930
but like I'm not going for,
like I said to someone of was like,

2533
01:51:01,990 --> 01:51:02,823
I said,
well when we were talking about doing 

2534
01:51:03,461 --> 01:51:04,780
pro over the special,
I was like,

2535
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:06,670
I'm going to do a golf video.
And they're like,

2536
01:51:06,671 --> 01:51:07,510
why?
I go,

2537
01:51:07,511 --> 01:51:09,100
I don't know.
They seem to be all over the place.

2538
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:13,420
Looking at cough is so popular right 
now.

2539
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:15,400
Coats,
I get a lot of boats,

2540
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:19,690
like just dudes in boats.
I got the shoe.

2541
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:23,380
The faster then challenge as to then,
yeah,

2542
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:24,700
like it's,
it's,

2543
01:51:24,701 --> 01:51:27,640
I think it's just a black instagram 
doing it,

2544
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:29,320
but they go,
man,

2545
01:51:29,321 --> 01:51:32,410
all these motherfuckers be like,
it's a shot of the ground like this.

2546
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:33,970
Or like this is the ground,
this is the phone.

2547
01:51:33,971 --> 01:51:36,040
The phone's on the ground.
You don't see the person's face.

2548
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:36,874
You see their foot stepping the shot and
then they start tying their shoes like 

2549
01:51:39,461 --> 01:51:40,294
mantel.
He's these motherfucking saying they'd 

2550
01:51:40,751 --> 01:51:42,400
be faster than me.
They ain't nobody faster than me.

2551
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:43,683
And they're tying their shoe and as soon
as their shoes tied to like I'm fat and 

2552
01:51:45,521 --> 01:51:46,354
they take off running away from the 
camera paired one challenge type in 

2553
01:51:50,411 --> 01:51:50,851
running.
John,

2554
01:51:50,851 --> 01:51:52,720
I'm not in the packet running telegram 
here.

2555
01:51:52,721 --> 01:51:55,030
Let me know.
I'm all over black instagram.

2556
01:51:56,230 --> 01:51:59,270
That's my,
I think I might just be black and white.

2557
01:51:59,271 --> 01:52:02,350
What does it fall running challenge?
I have not.

2558
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:05,920
I'm damn,
is this,

2559
01:52:05,921 --> 01:52:10,921
um,
it'd be woke for not knowing this.

2560
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:14,860
Oh,
this is from 2016.

2561
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:15,590
No,
there's,

2562
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:17,230
they're brand new.
I think it's running.

2563
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:19,000
Running man challenge.
Nope.

2564
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:20,240
Hold on.
Let me see if I can pull.

2565
01:52:20,250 --> 01:52:21,340
Said,
running challenge.

2566
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:22,630
Instagram.
This is niche,

2567
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:23,800
man.
You're in deep on this shit.

2568
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:27,950
I met Jesus and Miro through,
um,

2569
01:52:28,150 --> 01:52:33,010
black twitter.
Is that another APP that the APP?

2570
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:33,873
No,
this is the rich running challenge 

2571
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:37,870
challenge.
They're all running challenge.

2572
01:52:38,170 --> 01:52:39,550
All right,
well I hear,

2573
01:52:39,630 --> 01:52:40,030
Oh,
what?

2574
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:42,430
You know what?
Let me go on instagram itself.

2575
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:44,560
Look to Kashi.
Six nine.

2576
01:52:44,561 --> 01:52:45,680
Did one of them hang on.

2577
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:47,173
Oh,
I think the Kashi six nine might have 

2578
01:52:47,811 --> 01:52:49,370
started it.
Oh fuck.

2579
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:51,590
I don't know how to Bro.
I,

2580
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:56,710
I don't know how to watch it so everyone
can see it and you ain't got damn.

2581
01:52:57,120 --> 01:53:01,010
So they'll make me back.
So back in the day,

2582
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,520
back in the day,
this is a mirror.

2583
01:53:02,521 --> 01:53:04,100
We're all about black twitter.
Right?

2584
01:53:04,101 --> 01:53:04,934
And I love black twitter.
Like it was my favorite and they'd have 

2585
01:53:07,491 --> 01:53:08,324
like a,
the one that I got involved with was a 

2586
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:17,050
va gifts for the hood Hashtag 
Valentine's Day gets for hood.

2587
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:19,820
And it was all I found.
I mean like I'm not,

2588
01:53:19,821 --> 01:53:21,830
I'm not saying I'm progressive,
I'm just a regular dude.

2589
01:53:21,831 --> 01:53:25,490
But like I found it to be a tad bit like
almost a little racist because they were

2590
01:53:25,491 --> 01:53:26,324
just,
it was like the worst things about the 

2591
01:53:27,381 --> 01:53:30,170
hood and they were saying that's what 
you should get your girl for Valentine's

2592
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:31,003
Day.
They're like,

2593
01:53:31,070 --> 01:53:31,903
how about a mattress out by it?
I behind the hood cause you can jump on 

2594
01:53:35,091 --> 01:53:35,841
it.
Like I was like,

2595
01:53:35,841 --> 01:53:36,674
Huh.
And then they're like get her a click 

2596
01:53:38,301 --> 01:53:38,901
clack,
you know,

2597
01:53:38,901 --> 01:53:41,120
she needs,
once you got seven getting another baby.

2598
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,890
Like those were all the things.
And I was like,

2599
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:46,790
and so then as a joke I went on and I 
wrote va gets or the hood and I was like

2600
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:51,350
anything,
dungeons and dragons son and this guy,

2601
01:53:51,351 --> 01:53:52,970
these guys were like,
no man,

2602
01:53:52,971 --> 01:53:54,800
the same for you.
And I was like,

2603
01:53:55,190 --> 01:53:56,450
what?
Well and they're like,

2604
01:53:56,451 --> 01:53:57,284
we don't play dungeons and dragons.
Like they thought I was being serious 

2605
01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:00,380
and I was like,
okay,

2606
01:54:00,381 --> 01:54:01,214
okay.
In the same Hashtag I'm applying to all 

2607
01:54:03,621 --> 01:54:04,454
of them.
And I'm like,

2608
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,510
okay,
I'm sorry.

2609
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:07,160
I go,
how about a class pen?

2610
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,020
And do are like,
no bro,

2611
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:10,153
we don't,
we don't fuck with Class II pens and 

2612
01:54:11,601 --> 01:54:13,910
they're like a,
and that was like everyone was coming at

2613
01:54:13,911 --> 01:54:15,240
me and then I was like,
all right,

2614
01:54:15,470 --> 01:54:18,860
how about abolish champagne but sprayed 
all over like a Ho and they're like,

2615
01:54:18,861 --> 01:54:22,040
that's more like it.
And he got,

2616
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:23,330
we got some running challenge.

2617
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:24,213
Yeah,
we got it.

2618
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:28,180
Here we go.
Could you do that under your profile?

2619
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:32,910
Come on.
I got to tell you.

2620
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:34,263
Windows has been fucking me for so long 
with this Internet explorer shit like 

2621
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:40,000
you know,
nobody wants to use this shit.

2622
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:43,600
I have adblock installed.
I'm doing a live show for a reason.

2623
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:46,090
I don't want pop ups when I'm doing a 
live show.

2624
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:47,013
I have sponsors for Christ's sake.
There's like good money for those 

2625
01:54:49,811 --> 01:54:50,644
sponsorships and now I've got curiosity 
stream plus sprint getting free 

2626
01:54:53,621 --> 01:54:55,300
advertisement.
I don't think so.

2627
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:57,553
It's what he did it just go away.
I closed it and I got to open it on 

2628
01:55:00,101 --> 01:55:00,934
chrome on a separate menu.
But I feel like I've changed it so many 

2629
01:55:03,341 --> 01:55:07,690
times to preference chrome instead of 
Internet explorer.

2630
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:10,810
I was at the airport the day trust,
she's 69 got jumped.

2631
01:55:11,830 --> 01:55:13,820
Like if you got into a fight at the,
he had an album,

2632
01:55:17,110 --> 01:55:22,110
you got to figure this out on video.
It was driving me crazy fast.

2633
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,130
Whoa.
What's going on?

2634
01:55:27,131 --> 01:55:28,270
It's way let me actually,

2635
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:31,463
I don't want to blink.
I guess he did this video and then 

2636
01:55:33,331 --> 01:55:36,210
people are now copying that video 
started running.

2637
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:38,460
Started as to Kashi six.

2638
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:40,880
So he's goofing around.
He's a funny guy.

2639
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:44,100
He's trolling hate when people

2640
01:55:44,150 --> 01:55:48,150
like underestimate me.
Like how fast I am a for one video,

2641
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:51,960
that was one video.
Like I'm fast.

2642
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:57,010
They're saying slower,
some shit and fastest fuck Yo.

2643
01:55:59,941 --> 01:56:04,941
I hate when who's or uh,
yeah,

2644
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:07,030
he's got six,
nine tall,

2645
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:09,600
tattooed all over him.
That's dedication man.

2646
01:56:09,910 --> 01:56:11,280
Yeah,
making it work.

2647
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,920
There's only one way to do it this way.
I swung,

2648
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:14,833
got beat.
He got beat up at the airport and then 

2649
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:17,530
got beat up by,
I mean yeah,

2650
01:56:17,540 --> 01:56:21,030
he got beat up but and then I was in 
line behind them and security.

2651
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:25,190
Oh I was there.
I pulled up a,

2652
01:56:25,650 --> 01:56:30,570
I guess some crips bloods.
He was gang related and no bloods,

2653
01:56:30,571 --> 01:56:32,830
maybe I can see this before bloods.
Mm hmm.

2654
01:56:32,910 --> 01:56:34,860
Um,
he,

2655
01:56:34,861 --> 01:56:38,970
uh,
I have a joke inside my head.

2656
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:41,640
I call it,
he should've called himself sickle cell.

2657
01:56:41,641 --> 01:56:42,410
He's got beef with

2658
01:56:42,410 --> 01:56:44,960
blood.
It's really,

2659
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:50,810
really good.
Really good.

2660
01:56:51,690 --> 01:56:54,230
I was great.
You got some people

2661
01:56:54,610 --> 01:56:55,443
blood and so they were at the airport 
and they followed him to the airport I 

2662
01:56:57,641 --> 01:56:58,474
guess.
And then they got out and they started 

2663
01:56:59,501 --> 01:57:00,334
talking trash.
And then two guys fought his whole 

2664
01:57:03,071 --> 01:57:06,220
posse.
And I don't know if he got beat up.

2665
01:57:06,221 --> 01:57:08,260
I can't remember if he got beat up,
but they didn't win.

2666
01:57:08,530 --> 01:57:09,790
And so,
uh,

2667
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,890
it,
it sounds like they were outmatched well

2668
01:57:11,891 --> 01:57:12,724
his posse had like six dudes with them 
and know the bullets was to look them 

2669
01:57:15,850 --> 01:57:18,100
out and they didn't get,
they didn't lose.

2670
01:57:18,101 --> 01:57:18,934
I'll just say that.
And so then the cops come and I'm 

2671
01:57:21,941 --> 01:57:25,540
checking,
I'm curb checking a bag and I'm watching

2672
01:57:25,541 --> 01:57:28,720
all of this and then like the end tmzs 
there and I'm like,

2673
01:57:28,990 --> 01:57:30,970
tmz comes back and I'm like,
who is he?

2674
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:32,430
And he's like,
Takashi six nine.

2675
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:34,390
So then I go to the clear thing and I 
go,

2676
01:57:34,391 --> 01:57:35,290
hey,
who's the wrapper?

2677
01:57:35,290 --> 01:57:35,900
And they're like,
Gosh,

2678
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:39,040
she's 69 and then one of the girls goes,
he's got an album coming out.

2679
01:57:39,041 --> 01:57:40,450
That's why he's fighting.
When I was like,

2680
01:57:40,451 --> 01:57:41,560
really?
And then I was like,

2681
01:57:41,950 --> 01:57:44,530
tmc was there,
GMC was already there.

2682
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:45,633
But TMZ is promoting.
Why would he get his ass kicked by two 

2683
01:57:47,831 --> 01:57:49,600
guys?
I think he's just got a twist to that.

2684
01:57:49,601 --> 01:57:50,434
Better.
Yeah.

2685
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:51,460
I don't know.
I think it's just,

2686
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:52,480
I don't know.
I don't know.

2687
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,490
Anyway,
I like some,

2688
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,080
I had friends go,
don't even talk about him.

2689
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:57,620
Like don't even bring his name up 
because they'll,

2690
01:57:57,970 --> 01:58:00,040
people will kill the Mexican mafia will 
kill you.

2691
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:00,881
Whoa.
Yeah.

2692
01:58:00,881 --> 01:58:01,714
And I was like,
Bro,

2693
01:58:02,830 --> 01:58:03,663
dude

2694
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:06,053
man,
this shit now I'm wrapped up in his 

2695
01:58:07,901 --> 01:58:10,030
little corolla.
Always just when you were like,

2696
01:58:10,031 --> 01:58:11,470
wow,
bloods follow him to the airport.

2697
01:58:11,471 --> 01:58:12,304
I was like,
tell me how to make that not happen to 

2698
01:58:13,841 --> 01:58:14,674
me.
Just mentioning his name and I'm a 

2699
01:58:18,881 --> 01:58:19,714
bloods channeling me.
There is some black guys dressed in red 

2700
01:58:23,111 --> 01:58:25,120
are calling me a serger sky cap.
Oh.

2701
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:27,281
Um,
but yeah,

2702
01:58:27,281 --> 01:58:29,140
then then,
uh,

2703
01:58:29,170 --> 01:58:30,003
but then I watched like that was the 
beginning of me finding out who he was 

2704
01:58:31,841 --> 01:58:34,870
and then he's been like everywhere ever 
since I've seen him everywhere.

2705
01:58:34,871 --> 01:58:36,470
He just did a video with Nicki,
Nicki,

2706
01:58:37,690 --> 01:58:39,400
Nicki Minaj,
me getting out lately.

2707
01:58:39,401 --> 01:58:41,020
She did this,
she had been kind of cool.

2708
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:43,510
She kind of collabs with,
you know,

2709
01:58:43,570 --> 01:58:44,930
with a lot of people.
It could,

2710
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:47,140
you hear a diss track about the guys who
fucked.

2711
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:50,290
So was that all arbitrators chief fucked
drake.

2712
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:51,940
Yeah.
And all those guys,

2713
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:53,860
all of them.
And I loved it.

2714
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:55,420
But she say she did,
but I think she would,

2715
01:58:55,570 --> 01:58:56,890
I think it's,
I think it's a joke.

2716
01:58:57,020 --> 01:59:00,340
I was like,
she tried to fuck 54,

2717
01:59:00,341 --> 01:59:01,174
a powerful hour,
but all he wanted to do is talk power 

2718
01:59:02,981 --> 01:59:03,814
for hours.
It's a distract of like of like all the 

2719
01:59:06,281 --> 01:59:08,800
guys that if she did have sex from this,
how they'd have sex.

2720
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:11,560
I loved the one she did about a Odell 
Beckham.

2721
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:15,370
She was like something about wanting to 
have sex with Odell back on.

2722
01:59:15,371 --> 01:59:16,204
But then I felt,
what is it that I didn't mean that to a 

2723
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:20,133
stop you in your tracks.
This is real much better than Paul 

2724
01:59:24,030 --> 01:59:26,500
Florida and I'll Paul Blart mall cop.
I do.

2725
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:30,820
This guy's an actual mall cop.
His name is Paul Florida and he,

2726
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:35,140
what he does is he takes a v of himself 
farting every day on the job.

2727
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:36,843
You want to start from the genesis or do
you want to start somewhere in the 

2728
01:59:38,261 --> 01:59:39,094
middle?
I would like to go to the one with the 

2729
01:59:39,491 --> 01:59:44,491
most comments on it.
Let's scroll through Paul Florida.

2730
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:46,633
Cool.

2731
01:59:48,670 --> 01:59:50,140
He was actually fired,
uh,

2732
01:59:50,290 --> 01:59:52,750
dramatically.
There was a viral video where they found

2733
01:59:52,751 --> 01:59:53,620
his account.
They're like,

2734
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:55,330
dude,
you're fired.

2735
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:57,550
And he filmed the whole thing.
Um,

2736
01:59:57,580 --> 02:00:00,330
I should probably,
can you find that I'm in.

2737
02:00:00,910 --> 02:00:02,800
This is,
this is a hot new thing.

2738
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:07,860
This is a hot new thing.
Paul Flirt and Paul Flirt.

2739
02:00:14,430 --> 02:00:15,300
He worked.
He wrote,

2740
02:00:15,301 --> 02:00:16,134
we are off.

2741
02:00:18,170 --> 02:00:19,003
We're off.

2742
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:20,730
Not Aunt,
just,

2743
02:00:20,790 --> 02:00:21,623
no,
I thought it said,

2744
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:22,923
oh,
sorry.

2745
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:24,510
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

2746
02:00:24,510 --> 02:00:29,040
Is that have 74,000?
Why don't they show the view?

2747
02:00:29,070 --> 02:00:32,490
Cause they're all videos.
I'm curious how much people are watching

2748
02:00:32,491 --> 02:00:35,880
these hundred percent real and 100% of 
the time.

2749
02:00:35,881 --> 02:00:37,350
Paul,
from like 2000 views.

2750
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:39,413
I liked it somehow.
One of these is somehow more watchable 

2751
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:43,820
and another one.
Yeah,

2752
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:46,890
but like this one went viral,
but this one didn't get that many.

2753
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:49,860
Then come physician was really the guy 
liked you.

2754
02:00:49,861 --> 02:00:51,600
Tell me,
do you know Bob Meddory?

2755
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:55,230
Oh wait,
you don't know Bob Battery?

2756
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:57,720
Is that an instagram thing?
Oh my God.

2757
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:01,050
He makes me laugh so fucking hard.
Instagram,

2758
02:01:01,051 --> 02:01:02,100
comedy,
instagram,

2759
02:01:02,250 --> 02:01:03,660
instagram,
and he's,

2760
02:01:03,870 --> 02:01:04,820
where's this?
I'll,

2761
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:06,690
I'll hang on.
Tell me that.

2762
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:08,700
I'll text you the number of the foreign 
to watch.

2763
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:10,980
He does.
He just comments on,

2764
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:16,700
he does commentary over sporting events,
but it's 10 I opened discord.

2765
02:01:19,010 --> 02:01:20,340
I clicked.
This horn doesn't open.

2766
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,260
I want to show you guys this fee of him 
getting fired.

2767
02:01:22,290 --> 02:01:24,080
I would do want to watch that.
Yeah,

2768
02:01:24,090 --> 02:01:25,650

2769
02:01:31,050 --> 02:01:31,711
Oh my God.
Hold on.

2770
02:01:31,711 --> 02:01:35,820
This isn't a costume.
This is a real human being.

2771
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:38,610
No,
that's a really far.

2772
02:01:38,630 --> 02:01:42,020
It's on job and now the thing fired.

2775
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:51,710
Paul Flora loses his job due to his 
viral fan.

2776
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:53,053
Oh my God.
I wish I had the balls to put that as a 

2777
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:55,753
headline here.
He said before you complain about 

2778
02:01:58,281 --> 02:01:59,114
vertical video,
I was live on instagram when this 

2779
02:02:00,321 --> 02:02:03,080
happened and they only support vertical 
to the best of my knowledge.

2780
02:02:03,170 --> 02:02:05,870
Hashtag Paul Florida Hashtag Fart by the
way.

2781
02:02:05,871 --> 02:02:09,640

2787
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:20,863

My body has started building.

2789
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:31,340
I sound like air bubble bursting guy.

Nope.

2792
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:36,170
Not Anymore.
Not Anymore.

2793

Yeah,

2796
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:48,953
hold on.
There's a bunch of pissed off people 

2797
02:02:50,421 --> 02:02:51,254
here.
Okay.

2798
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:51,920
Okay.
Okay.

2799
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:53,360
What are you doing with Gordon,
sir?

2800
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:55,460
Why you were born?
No Sir.

2801
02:02:56,030 --> 02:02:56,791
Yes sir.
No Sir.

2802
02:02:56,791 --> 02:02:58,460
You're not going to record me wearing 
that uniform.

2803
02:02:58,860 --> 02:02:59,621
When you say a hundred,
a hundred.

2804
02:02:59,621 --> 02:03:00,321
And they said,
okay,

2805
02:03:00,321 --> 02:03:02,330
you can turn it off.
Okay.

2806
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:03,440
Well,
so you're firing me anyway,

2807
02:03:03,441 --> 02:03:04,041
right?
Yes,

2808
02:03:04,041 --> 02:03:04,511
I am.
Yeah.

2809
02:03:04,511 --> 02:03:07,010
So I'm going to keep me the $20.
If you're gonna fire me,

2810
02:03:07,011 --> 02:03:07,580
I'm done.
Okay.

2811
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:09,800
So I can just walk out of here right now
and then if that's it.

2812
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:10,790
Okay.
I mean,

2813
02:03:10,791 --> 02:03:12,620
if you guys are gonna fire me like 
what's,

2814
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:17,000
well,
you do realize that you're on a client's

2815
02:03:17,001 --> 02:03:17,834
property.
Yeah.

2816
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:18,561
Where are you?
Yada,

2817
02:03:18,561 --> 02:03:19,001
Yada,
Yada.

2818
02:03:19,001 --> 02:03:22,960
You get the idea that the hip getting 
fired.

2819
02:03:22,961 --> 02:03:24,340
The guy tell him to turn his camera off.
He's like,

2820
02:03:24,341 --> 02:03:25,510
no,
if you're firing me,

2821
02:03:25,511 --> 02:03:28,000
I'm not printing Mike.
Never mind.

2822
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:28,931
Wait,
I'm fired.

2823
02:03:28,931 --> 02:03:29,764
Right,
right.

2824
02:03:29,890 --> 02:03:34,210
I just tweeted the one video from Bob 
Meddory on my twitter page.

2825
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:37,750
So if you go to twitter and pull it up,
this is a really,

2826
02:03:37,930 --> 02:03:39,600
um,
this one thing way of,

2827
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,980
of given me the ability to open a,
yeah,

2828
02:03:42,510 --> 02:03:44,950
we got,
let me go to your twitter.

2829
02:03:45,370 --> 02:03:47,430
Okay.
Like A,

2830
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:48,880
you.
Okay,

2831
02:03:48,881 --> 02:03:51,640
good down.
And it's that right there.

2832
02:03:51,670 --> 02:03:54,160
That's funny.
I love that.

2833
02:03:54,190 --> 02:03:54,911
That,
okay.

2834
02:03:54,911 --> 02:03:55,690
You got it.
How weak,

2835
02:03:55,690 --> 02:03:57,440
how we share it.
This is the way he comments.

2836
02:03:57,450 --> 02:04:00,130
So imagine if this was the sports 
commentator for this.

2837
02:04:00,131 --> 02:04:02,440
Okay.
And this is politically incorrect.

2838
02:04:02,441 --> 02:04:04,150
So if you get triggered,
just hang up.

2839
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:05,083
That's Bob's fault.

2840
02:04:05,910 --> 02:04:06,490
Well,
Peter,

2841
02:04:06,490 --> 02:04:08,400
let's call a spade a spade.
These guys,

2842
02:04:08,401 --> 02:04:12,750
Hey Jennifer Garcia in the black shorts,
which changing punches early.

2843
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:16,800
Oh my goodness.
He rips his fucking job right off.

2844
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:20,620
It's no longer show.
His name is Gilbert grape.

2845
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:24,180
She's retarded right now.
He says,

2846
02:04:24,181 --> 02:04:25,920
give me your son.
What's my name?

2847
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:28,550
Sosa says your name,
referee.

2848
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:33,740
My Name's Jeff.
Rushes to the fucking Holy Shit.

2849
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:55,340
He's really good at writing,
please.

2850
02:04:55,631 --> 02:04:58,470
She said in the fetal position right 
now,

2851
02:04:58,790 --> 02:05:00,760
it's again saying,
yeah

2852
02:05:05,650 --> 02:05:06,220
sir,

2853
02:05:06,220 --> 02:05:07,053
we'll beat her.

2854
02:05:07,810 --> 02:05:10,210
He does eat.
He's used someone.

2855
02:05:10,211 --> 02:05:12,590
You can scroll through his instagram and
the,

2856
02:05:12,650 --> 02:05:14,020
not all the Bob.
Hey Bob.

2857
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:16,450
Bob Men are mandatory and they're just 
funny.

2858
02:05:16,451 --> 02:05:18,610
Like he's it,
it makes me giggle.

2859
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:20,200
Just those little one.
I love it.

2860
02:05:20,230 --> 02:05:22,870
I love these guys just out there making 
comedy.

2861
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:24,253
Yeah.
It's like it's hit or miss and he's got 

2862
02:05:25,870 --> 02:05:28,610
a ton of followers,
but normally everything he puts out,

2863
02:05:28,611 --> 02:05:31,720
it just makes me giggle.
But the best is I'll be flipping through

2864
02:05:31,721 --> 02:05:32,554
them and I'll,
I'll be laying in bed listening to him 

2865
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:36,910
and also my wife will come home and be 
like,

2866
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:37,773
Yo,
Georgia had an overnight and he's 

2867
02:05:38,711 --> 02:05:41,690
fucking yelling at the top of his lungs.
Put Your fucking phone down.

2868
02:05:43,090 --> 02:05:43,923
He's fucking so uh,
tell me about secret time on Netflix 

2869
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:54,220
right now.
Streamable Yup.

2870
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:56,140
Everybody has netflix.
Everyone does.

2871
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:57,880
Pretty much,
I've not got it on my phone.

2872
02:05:58,330 --> 02:06:00,490
Yeah.
That's the bazaars thing in the world is

2873
02:06:00,491 --> 02:06:04,390
that my dad said to my daughters,
don't watch netflix.

2874
02:06:04,391 --> 02:06:06,700
She that when people watch Netflix on 
the ride to school on the bus,

2875
02:06:06,770 --> 02:06:07,603
I know.
I'm like,

2876
02:06:07,660 --> 02:06:10,060
oh my God,
going to see me on the front page and be

2877
02:06:10,061 --> 02:06:11,260
like,
is this your dad?

2878
02:06:11,261 --> 02:06:13,840
Click my wife looks like Elvis when she 
has an orgasm.

2879
02:06:15,130 --> 02:06:16,750
But yeah,
it was great man.

2880
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:18,280
Shove it in Philadelphia at the 
Trocadero.

2881
02:06:18,730 --> 02:06:19,563
Uh,
did six shows tape to first show was 

2882
02:06:22,991 --> 02:06:25,800
mediocre when that great.
And then the Lilly,

2883
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:28,090
why show me,
okay.

2884
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:31,750
It was raining that night and are the,
um,

2885
02:06:32,410 --> 02:06:36,520
the generator went out and so we didn't 
have electricity for an hour and a half.

2886
02:06:36,610 --> 02:06:37,443
Oh.
So the,

2887
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:39,670
the first show I had to wait in the rain
for an hour and a half.

2888
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:41,800
Ooh.
And lose their buzz.

2889
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:44,380
And then we brought him in and sat them.

2890
02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:46,300
They're wet,
they're unhappy man.

2891
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:48,550
Tough crowd.
And it's Philly.

2892
02:06:48,730 --> 02:06:50,160
That's tough.
And they're actually,

2893
02:06:50,170 --> 02:06:52,600
I'll give you shit if you're recording 
your special fucking soaking wet.

2894
02:06:53,290 --> 02:06:54,123
My girl's hair is all fucked up.
And so then the first show was not the 

2895
02:06:57,941 --> 02:06:58,900
best.
It was okay.

2896
02:06:58,901 --> 02:07:00,520
It was like a,
an 80 out of a hundred,

2897
02:07:00,521 --> 02:07:02,560
but when you shoot a special,
you want a hundred.

2898
02:07:02,561 --> 02:07:03,394
Yeah.
So I went upstairs and I sat with my 

2899
02:07:05,201 --> 02:07:07,420
buddy Tony,
and we had a coffee and I,

2900
02:07:07,421 --> 02:07:08,290
he left.
And I was like,

2901
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:10,330
I've always said I like to be an under 
pressure.

2902
02:07:10,331 --> 02:07:12,520
I love La,
I love things live.

2903
02:07:12,521 --> 02:07:15,160
I love the pressure of things.
And I was like time to prove it.

2904
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:17,710
And I went out and literally had the 
best set of my,

2905
02:07:17,711 --> 02:07:20,650
like one of the best sets of my life,
but getting to end,

2906
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:21,933
I mean to the point where I screwed 
around and I added some shit and then I 

2907
02:07:25,331 --> 02:07:26,164
was just like,
I keep it in it and it was the best set 

2908
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:28,930
of my life.

2909
02:07:28,930 --> 02:07:29,763
And uh,
it went live last night and I was 

2910
02:07:32,531 --> 02:07:33,850
looking like on twitter,
you know,

2911
02:07:33,851 --> 02:07:36,250
you kind of gingerly and see like,
fuck,

2912
02:07:36,251 --> 02:07:39,460
what's something bad?
Everything's been good.

2913
02:07:39,461 --> 02:07:40,390
So you're just like,
all right,

2914
02:07:40,391 --> 02:07:41,224
cool.
I'm good.

2915
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:42,600
Yeah,
just let it sit out there,

2916
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:43,453
live out there.
People can watch it and enjoy it if you 

2917
02:07:44,981 --> 02:07:45,814
don't like it.
I think people at this point that they 

2918
02:07:47,531 --> 02:07:49,090
don't like it,
they're not going to take the time to go

2919
02:07:49,091 --> 02:07:51,700
and hate it online.
So I probably won't see that,

2920
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,030
hopefully,
but it's been a good response.

2921
02:07:55,430 --> 02:07:57,100
Um,
and people like you guys have liked it.

2922
02:07:57,101 --> 02:07:58,950
So we were like,
Joe liked it.

2923
02:07:59,450 --> 02:08:00,283
I mean,
listen,

2924
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:01,413
we're,
and we're like dying not to blow smoke 

2925
02:08:04,541 --> 02:08:05,690
up your ass,
but come on in,

2926
02:08:05,691 --> 02:08:08,080
you're in one of the top guys,
tall,

2927
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:12,190
very gray.
There's nobody that's going to turn that

2928
02:08:12,191 --> 02:08:13,900
on and be like,
this guy's fucking sucks.

2929
02:08:15,490 --> 02:08:17,050
Top class dude.
You're killing it.

2930
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:18,100
It's been,
it's been,

2931
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:21,250
I'm very happy with it.
And I think the real struggle is to make

2932
02:08:21,251 --> 02:08:22,084
sure you have a new hour so that when 
you're touring now people come out to 

2933
02:08:24,551 --> 02:08:28,270
see when they see all the material.
And so I got a new 52 minutes.

2934
02:08:28,330 --> 02:08:28,930
So,
um,

2935
02:08:28,930 --> 02:08:31,690
cool.
So how long does it take you to prep?

2936
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:33,610
Like a whole hour like that,
you know?

2937
02:08:33,710 --> 02:08:34,290
Uh,
from,

2938
02:08:34,290 --> 02:08:35,230
uh,
for right now,

2939
02:08:35,231 --> 02:08:39,360
from February until now.
So yeah,

2940
02:08:39,570 --> 02:08:42,490
about six months to write a new hour.
You spent how many?

2941
02:08:42,491 --> 02:08:43,324
Just great.
It's a,

2942
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:45,790
it's not perfect,
but it's a new hour of that.

2943
02:08:45,791 --> 02:08:50,791
I can stand and talk and then from this 
six months till the next six months,

2944
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:52,223
um,
it'll get tighter and I'll add some new 

2945
02:08:53,891 --> 02:08:54,724
bits.
I'll find some new transitions and I'll 

2946
02:08:56,261 --> 02:08:58,260
make things stronger.
Uh,

2947
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:01,120
and then,
and then you hopefully you talking about

2948
02:09:01,121 --> 02:09:02,710
your show that you've been thinking,
God,

2949
02:09:02,890 --> 02:09:04,720
the standup show I'm doing on the road 
right now,

2950
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:06,730
the one I'm doing tonight,
nirvana still evolving.

2951
02:09:06,910 --> 02:09:08,920
And so you're still evolving this one,
but it's good.

2952
02:09:08,921 --> 02:09:13,000
It's an hour of like new material.
You fuck around a little bit on stage.

2953
02:09:13,001 --> 02:09:14,980
You have fun in the moment.
Little crowd work.

2954
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:16,390
It's,
I mean I've been doing standup so I can,

2955
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:19,480
I can cheat it for an hour but,
and then I,

2956
02:09:19,490 --> 02:09:22,450
then at the end I ask whatever stories 
people want to hear and they always said

2957
02:09:22,451 --> 02:09:23,284
the machine,
I'll tell the machine lying dildos are 

2958
02:09:24,521 --> 02:09:25,354
the ones,
everyone noise once and the next six 

2959
02:09:27,401 --> 02:09:28,234
months it gets better.
And then you should get an offer within 

2960
02:09:30,371 --> 02:09:32,920
three months after that have to do 
another special,

2961
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:36,280
like 18 months is the period of s the 
life,

2962
02:09:36,281 --> 02:09:38,200
the distance train specials.
It should be.

2963
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:39,093
And so how is there a process?
So by the time you're doing the Netflix 

2964
02:09:42,161 --> 02:09:43,900
special,
you've already done this show.

2965
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:45,850
Tons of time.
Yes.

2966
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:47,380
So there's no rehearsing.
You're like,

2967
02:09:47,770 --> 02:09:49,820
I know this.
Oh well what happens is like you,

2968
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:51,790
I did my one special one,
I gave it to you.

2969
02:09:51,820 --> 02:09:52,653
And then I wrote my new hour and then I 
worked at and I knew what I liked and 

2970
02:09:55,421 --> 02:09:56,254
knew I had.
My one big piece that I loved was the 

2971
02:09:58,031 --> 02:10:00,220
zip lining story.
So that was like the center.

2972
02:10:00,221 --> 02:10:03,610
So I wanted to work and the way Netflix 
works to people only watch 32 hours,

2973
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:06,010
32 minutes and not sure they say,
you know,

2974
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:06,933
so I wanted to put that in the middle so
that if you were going to only watch 32 

2975
02:10:09,281 --> 02:10:11,110
minutes,
some medium bit,

2976
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:13,450
it's like a really great bit so that you
go well,

2977
02:10:13,451 --> 02:10:15,170
shit and home watching the rest.
Right.

2978
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:17,820
So I wanted the tent pole round that,
uh,

2979
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:20,830
and so I think I did a properly,
um,

2980
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:22,270
but,
uh,

2981
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:26,350
but what happened is by the time I got 
the offer in like the end of October,

2982
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:28,240
middle of October,
maybe when I got the offer,

2983
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:30,250
I then said,
ah,

2984
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,140
it's fucking on.

2985
02:10:32,170 --> 02:10:34,670
Like I was like,
I'm taping it in February,

2986
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:35,513
the end of February and D in Philly,
I did 150 shows with that hour 

2987
02:10:38,661 --> 02:10:40,490
specifically.
Like just,

2988
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:42,710
you'd go out on,
on Tuesday,

2989
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:45,230
do two shows,
Tuesday two shows Wednesday in different

2990
02:10:45,231 --> 02:10:47,120
cities and go a weekend,
two shows,

2991
02:10:47,121 --> 02:10:48,890
Thursday two shows,
Friday two shows Saturday.

2992
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:49,783
Right.
And I did that cause you want to take 

2993
02:10:51,051 --> 02:10:52,940
that hour and you want to make it tight,
you record it,

2994
02:10:53,090 --> 02:10:55,430
you watch it and you find out where the 
loose parts are,

2995
02:10:55,431 --> 02:10:56,264
where the,
where you can just see lazy writing and 

2996
02:10:57,741 --> 02:11:01,520
then you find a joke there.
So you've taped it and washed it back,

2997
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:03,710
like watching like a baseball replay or 
some shit.

2998
02:11:03,830 --> 02:11:04,360
Yeah,
some,

2999
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:05,193
well what it is is like,
so you look at the whole hour and then 

3000
02:11:06,831 --> 02:11:07,664
you go,
okay,

3001
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:09,770
um,
this fits working in this Pittsburgh,

3002
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:11,190
this what's working,
what's not working.

3003
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:13,730
Then you find the one that's not working
and you really focus on that,

3004
02:11:13,731 --> 02:11:14,564
punch it up,
make sure it's got an ending of middle 

3005
02:11:15,861 --> 02:11:16,580
of beginning,
like it.

3006
02:11:16,580 --> 02:11:17,413
Make sure that it's rich it,
and then how do you still know what's 

3007
02:11:20,071 --> 02:11:23,270
working enough to use?
Like you watch yourself and your,

3008
02:11:23,450 --> 02:11:25,550
you've done it so many times.
I'm like,

3009
02:11:25,551 --> 02:11:27,950
do you still know what's funny?
You know what I mean?

3010
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:29,690
Yeah,
I think so.

3011
02:11:29,930 --> 02:11:33,290
Um,
when we have to edit on videos,

3012
02:11:33,291 --> 02:11:34,124
we'll watch it so many times that we're 
just feel like we don't even know 

3013
02:11:37,101 --> 02:11:37,934
anymore.
I think the difference is he's got an 

3014
02:11:38,951 --> 02:11:40,070
audience,
you're like,

3015
02:11:40,210 --> 02:11:42,080
oh shit.
But it's like the small,

3016
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:43,753
so like,
like there's really small things that 

3017
02:11:45,561 --> 02:11:49,370
will sell a bit and you don't know why 
it worked.

3018
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:51,290
And so you have to go back and watch the
tape and go,

3019
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:54,210
oh,
I did something different than that that

3020
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,850
I've ever done.
And then you go,

3021
02:11:55,851 --> 02:11:56,690
okay,
that's now,

3022
02:11:56,691 --> 02:11:57,441
then.
Then you're like,

3023
02:11:57,441 --> 02:11:58,274
all right,
that's in the bit.

3024
02:11:58,610 --> 02:12:00,770
Does it ever happen where you get 
laughter,

3025
02:12:00,771 --> 02:12:02,000
but you're like,
that's not funny.

3026
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:03,080
Yup.
Huh.

3027
02:12:03,470 --> 02:12:04,800
That's an interesting thing,
right?

3028
02:12:04,890 --> 02:12:06,830
It's keeping in fuck it.
They like it.

3029
02:12:06,860 --> 02:12:07,693
I,
there's a joke I have that I just 

3030
02:12:08,541 --> 02:12:10,040
thought in this,
but sounded that any special,

3031
02:12:10,370 --> 02:12:12,260
um,
the joke is,

3032
02:12:12,261 --> 02:12:13,040
uh,
it's,

3033
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:14,030
it's,
it was just,

3034
02:12:14,031 --> 02:12:15,800
it's a throwaway joke that's it's kinda 
cheap.

3035
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:17,300
A little bit right.
A little hacky.

3036
02:12:17,301 --> 02:12:18,920
But,
but I thought it was fun joke.

3037
02:12:18,921 --> 02:12:20,920
I almost put it in this special,
uh,

3038
02:12:21,620 --> 02:12:23,330
and um,
the joke was,

3039
02:12:23,630 --> 02:12:26,510
you know what I think is really racist.
They don't make black baby powder.

3040
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:29,990
Like they just make white stuff like 
they should make.

3041
02:12:31,090 --> 02:12:31,641
And then I said,
well,

3042
02:12:31,641 --> 02:12:33,350
White Guy,
like you don't even get it.

3043
02:12:33,380 --> 02:12:35,690
Like when you get a rash and this is the
line coming up,

3044
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:37,970
I'll go like this when the line that 
doesn't make sense.

3045
02:12:37,971 --> 02:12:39,170
It gets a laugh.
I go,

3046
02:12:39,171 --> 02:12:41,810
you get a rash and you put it on and it 
just blends in.

3047
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:44,240
But when he gets rash and a point to a 
black guy go,

3048
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:46,130
he's got a ghost ride,
the whip,

3049
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:49,460
it makes no fucking sense,
but it just is a silly line.

3050
02:12:49,461 --> 02:12:53,020
And Pico I had a friend is like,
no one should laugh at that.

3051
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:54,560
It's not right.
And I go,

3052
02:12:54,561 --> 02:12:56,130
I don't know,
but it gets a big old and they're like,

3053
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:59,420
I love lines like that where the wording
doesn't even make sense.

3054
02:12:59,421 --> 02:13:02,920
The bureau like,
yeah.

3055
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:03,830
So,
uh,

3056
02:13:03,830 --> 02:13:05,080
that's fine.
Like I,

3057
02:13:05,081 --> 02:13:08,390
I had another joke about a black dicks 
in the same joke.

3058
02:13:08,391 --> 02:13:11,420
I was like,
you think black is a slimming color?

3059
02:13:11,630 --> 02:13:14,030
But it does.
The white ones should look big like a,

3060
02:13:14,210 --> 02:13:17,300
like a lighthouse in a fog or a 
flashlight in the haunted house.

3061
02:13:17,301 --> 02:13:18,920
And then I go,
what are your kids doing in here?

3062
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:20,090
And everyone's like,
no,

3063
02:13:20,091 --> 02:13:20,924
that's not how it last night and a 
haunted house work where you kids doing 

3064
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:23,390
in hair.

3065
02:13:23,390 --> 02:13:24,021
And I was like,
Oh,

3066
02:13:24,021 --> 02:13:28,670
I must've been thinking of Scooby Doo.
But I guess,

3067
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:30,110
yeah,
if it works at work,

3068
02:13:30,111 --> 02:13:30,944
it's like you can't explain,
you can't try to define what makes 

3069
02:13:33,061 --> 02:13:35,340
people laugh.
You just know it works.

3070
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:38,280
It's the life cycle is you work at,
you work at and to this,

3071
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:42,660
you really refine it like,
and the last fine way possible,

3072
02:13:42,661 --> 02:13:45,780
technical way possible.
And you just hope that Netflix is like,

3073
02:13:45,810 --> 02:13:46,800
all right,
we want it now.

3074
02:13:46,801 --> 02:13:50,280
Or do you kind of know that they're 
going to buy it at the law at the end of

3075
02:13:50,281 --> 02:13:51,480
the life cycle?
No,

3076
02:13:51,510 --> 02:13:52,343
we so,
well I think there's two ways to go 

3077
02:13:53,521 --> 02:13:54,520
about it.
One,

3078
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:59,100
the situation I was in is I had the 
hour,

3079
02:13:59,101 --> 02:14:01,620
I told my agents I got the hour,
I'm ready to do it.

3080
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:03,270
Um,
I've recorded it.

3081
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:04,373
Uh,
I paid for a company to come in and 

3082
02:14:06,241 --> 02:14:09,720
record it for me professionally,
but not professionally,

3083
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:10,890
like drama,
like,

3084
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:15,630
or like the Canon seven g seven,
whatever seventies,

3085
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:17,130
like they shot,
it looked pretty.

3086
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:19,620
I had it and I said I got it to show to 
them.

3087
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:21,570
And then there were like,
they were like,

3088
02:14:21,571 --> 02:14:22,860
no,
we're good.

3089
02:14:23,010 --> 02:14:23,843
We'll take it.
We,

3090
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:25,920
we don't need to see it sight unseen by 
it.

3091
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:29,430
We trust that you've you can deliver.
And so then,

3092
02:14:29,610 --> 02:14:32,610
but I'd already had a place I'd already 
booked to the truck to do shows.

3093
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:34,830
I knew I was going to shoot my special 
there,

3094
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:37,680
but then I get the offer from Netflix 
and then you go,

3095
02:14:37,681 --> 02:14:39,240
okay,
now I can pay for it the other way,

3096
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:41,760
and this is the more interesting way and
I,

3097
02:14:41,761 --> 02:14:42,930
I won't,
I,

3098
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:44,663
I won't say anyone's name only because I
don't know if it's not looked down upon 

3099
02:14:46,891 --> 02:14:47,724
at all.
It a lot of guys do it where they pay 

3100
02:14:49,471 --> 02:14:50,304
for it out of pocket.
They pay for their special out of 

3101
02:14:51,721 --> 02:14:52,554
pocket,
they shoot it and then they sell it to 

3102
02:14:53,821 --> 02:14:56,310
Netflix and make tons of money.

3103
02:14:56,790 --> 02:15:00,000
Like I'll say a name that someone who is
like the perfect example.

3104
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:02,370
Jo Koy went to Netflix and they were 
like,

3105
02:15:02,371 --> 02:15:03,204
I don't know if they were like,
didn't give him the number he liked or 

3106
02:15:05,161 --> 02:15:07,140
whatever.
And Jo Koy has got money.

3107
02:15:07,141 --> 02:15:10,260
He does really always done well.
He's got a restaurant.

3108
02:15:10,261 --> 02:15:11,520
Vegas.
Jo was like,

3109
02:15:11,521 --> 02:15:14,100
don't worry,
I got it shot his own special and like a

3110
02:15:14,101 --> 02:15:16,650
fucking stadium.
I think it's like in a huge theater.

3111
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:19,980
Then edits it gives it a Netflix because
what do you think?

3112
02:15:19,981 --> 02:15:20,461
And they're like,
oh,

3113
02:15:20,461 --> 02:15:21,294
we want it.
And he was like,

3114
02:15:21,540 --> 02:15:22,373
I'll tell you the price now.
And so then Jo Koy sells it for like a 

3115
02:15:24,391 --> 02:15:25,780
ton of money.
That was in the,

3116
02:15:26,850 --> 02:15:29,760
it's different because some people do 
that on a lower scale,

3117
02:15:30,330 --> 02:15:32,130
but with some people like Joe who got 
the money,

3118
02:15:32,131 --> 02:15:32,964
they make it legit.
A deliverable like were were netflix 

3119
02:15:35,581 --> 02:15:36,280
wants it.

3120
02:15:36,280 --> 02:15:37,113
I was looking up that Netflix wanted to 
do mine out of pocket of their own 

3121
02:15:39,901 --> 02:15:42,000
pocket and so that's how I got mine.
Right.

3122
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:43,153
But even still,
you're on the list of like all the big 

3123
02:15:44,551 --> 02:15:45,384
comics they have coming out.
How important are you going to be on 

3124
02:15:47,341 --> 02:15:48,174
that list?
You got to hope that they watch it and 

3125
02:15:49,651 --> 02:15:50,450
they like it.
Right?

3126
02:15:50,450 --> 02:15:50,990
Right.
Oh,

3127
02:15:50,990 --> 02:15:51,890
you're,
you're pre,

3128
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:54,180
is this your first special?
That was on Netflix.

3129
02:15:54,181 --> 02:15:54,820
Yeah,
that's,

3130
02:15:54,820 --> 02:15:57,270
that's one.
And then they liked it so much.

3131
02:15:57,271 --> 02:15:59,190
They bought my second wife earlier 
special.

3132
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:01,740
Then the machine there,
there was one about time,

3133
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:05,250
they're like doing a by that and I owned
it a by that,

3134
02:16:05,290 --> 02:16:06,123
I mean we'll put that on too.
So this will air for like three months 

3135
02:16:08,251 --> 02:16:09,710
and then that or for like,
yeah.

3136
02:16:09,750 --> 02:16:11,760
And then there'll be on for like four 
years I think.

3137
02:16:11,820 --> 02:16:13,540
So the machine is on Netflix right now.
It's going to,

3138
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:16,320
it should be on it.
It'll be on after this airs for a little

3139
02:16:16,321 --> 02:16:18,180
bit.
They want this to,

3140
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:20,650
you know,
kind of I guess get established fan base

3141
02:16:20,651 --> 02:16:21,484
and then when they put the other one on,
do you benefit when people watch it or 

3142
02:16:23,971 --> 02:16:24,804
they,
is it just straight licensing deal of 

3143
02:16:25,861 --> 02:16:27,060
strain?
They own it.

3144
02:16:27,180 --> 02:16:28,320
I don't even,
I don't think I only,

3145
02:16:28,340 --> 02:16:32,830
you don't get no benefits just from no,
the rating,

3146
02:16:33,050 --> 02:16:35,380
like if they see that it does really 
well.

3147
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:36,850
Yeah,
I think I get the right,

3148
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:38,890
they owed it for like four,
maybe four.

3149
02:16:38,891 --> 02:16:40,520
I don't know that I buy that.
I don't know the answer to that.

3150
02:16:40,521 --> 02:16:42,370
So,
but I think I owed for like four years.

3151
02:16:42,530 --> 02:16:44,140
And then at the end of four years,
they can either,

3152
02:16:44,380 --> 02:16:45,790
you know,
give me like a real,

3153
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:46,750
I mean real small.

3154
02:16:46,750 --> 02:16:48,980
It's a benefit to have it on Netflix as 
a fair.

3155
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,080
Have it in your pocket.
Yeah.

3156
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:54,390
Like I think Tom's first special went,
ran out in four years and I thought,

3157
02:16:54,391 --> 02:16:55,990
I'm sure they were like,
um,

3158
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:58,150
you could have a back.
And Tom was like,

3159
02:16:58,180 --> 02:17:00,130
or you can just keep it up that way.
And they're like,

3160
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:01,790
oh yeah,
we're good.

3161
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:03,710
Yeah.
But then you know,

3162
02:17:03,711 --> 02:17:04,940
some guys like bill burr,
like,

3163
02:17:04,941 --> 02:17:05,774
no,
I'll take my library back and I'll own 

3164
02:17:06,741 --> 02:17:08,330
everything.
And then when he dies,

3165
02:17:08,331 --> 02:17:08,931
everyone's like,
wait,

3166
02:17:08,931 --> 02:17:10,590
how do we get that bill bird thing?
Yeah.

3167
02:17:10,670 --> 02:17:12,080
You know?
But yeah,

3168
02:17:12,110 --> 02:17:17,090
so life insurance policy,
I guess he's almost wanting money.

3169
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:19,500
Oh,
I believe that bear.

3170
02:17:20,780 --> 02:17:21,630
But where do you,
where do you,

3171
02:17:21,650 --> 02:17:24,760
where,
where would he have made his fortune?

3172
02:17:24,770 --> 02:17:26,420
Just from selling stand up.
Oh dude,

3173
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:27,930
he's really cool.
He's all,

3174
02:17:27,950 --> 02:17:29,180
he's tells huge.

3175
02:17:29,180 --> 02:17:33,560
So He's playing in New York at like a,
like one of the huge venues.

3176
02:17:33,561 --> 02:17:35,380
He,
he plays like snake Liam.

3177
02:17:35,390 --> 02:17:39,110
He has one of the coolest stories.
He went into Boston and they were like,

3178
02:17:39,111 --> 02:17:40,370
Hey,
we want to book you at the Wilbur.

3179
02:17:40,371 --> 02:17:41,000
And he's like,
great.

3180
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:44,120
Wilbur says 1200 people and they're 
like,

3181
02:17:44,121 --> 02:17:45,260
great.
And he's like,

3182
02:17:45,261 --> 02:17:46,280
cool,
you want to do,

3183
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:48,860
we'll put a show on sale and we'll see 
if we can add a show.

3184
02:17:48,861 --> 02:17:49,700
And he's like,
all right.

3185
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:53,150
So then they put the show on sale and it
sells out in like five minutes,

3186
02:17:53,151 --> 02:17:54,350
five and they're like,
okay,

3187
02:17:54,370 --> 02:17:55,370
do you want to have to show him?
And he was like,

3188
02:17:55,371 --> 02:17:56,100
yeah.
And they're like,

3189
02:17:56,100 --> 02:17:56,933
you know that's sold out so quickly 
maybe do you want to add a Sunday show 

3190
02:17:58,551 --> 02:17:59,361
as well?
And he's like,

3191
02:17:59,361 --> 02:18:00,980
yeah.
So they put this,

3192
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:03,890
they hold the Sunday show,
they put second show on sale on Saturday

3193
02:18:04,010 --> 02:18:05,720
that sells out in five minutes.

3194
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:08,600
They put the show on Sunday,
sells out at another show,

3195
02:18:08,601 --> 02:18:12,770
sells out.
He sold out 19 shows.

3196
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:18,650
He was there for like two weeks in 
Boston every Monday,

3197
02:18:18,650 --> 02:18:18,650
Tuesday,
Wednesday,

3198
02:18:18,650 --> 02:18:18,650
Thursday,
Friday,

3199
02:18:18,650 --> 02:18:20,510
Saturday.
And he was at home,

3200
02:18:20,511 --> 02:18:22,040
let's be like stand at his parent's 
house.

3202
02:18:28,201 --> 02:18:30,010

3203
02:18:30,620 --> 02:18:31,790
Good for him.
He's amazing.

3204
02:18:32,030 --> 02:18:33,810
I love you got to get bill on your

Let me make that happen that we listen 

3207
02:18:40,251 --> 02:18:42,050
to his podcast.
Rick,

3208
02:18:42,130 --> 02:18:43,580
you know.
Oh,

3209
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:45,290
oh there's,
that's not a question.

3210
02:18:45,530 --> 02:18:47,240
That's not the question I'm making that 
happen.

3211
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:52,980
One of my best friends,
I love him and he's,

3212
02:18:53,250 --> 02:18:57,030
and he's and bill right now is like in 
me of the conversation.

3213
02:18:57,031 --> 02:18:57,864
We outside bill wants to have that 
conversation with you want to pick your 

3214
02:19:00,841 --> 02:19:01,674
brain.
He's like,

3215
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:03,420
well,
I guess I won't.

3216
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:05,533
I,
yeah,

3217
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:06,433
I don't know how much I want to say on 
the air about what we were talking 

3218
02:19:07,881 --> 02:19:08,714
about.
I,

3219
02:19:08,720 --> 02:19:11,670
when I listened to his shit now nobody 
knows anything while we're talking.

3220
02:19:12,620 --> 02:19:13,990
I'm like,
not even doing the show anymore.

3221
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:20,220
[inaudible] they go,
you've released this.

3222
02:19:21,921 --> 02:19:23,100
I go,
no,

3223
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:26,593
but when I listened to show,
I'm very keen on everything he does in 

3224
02:19:30,681 --> 02:19:31,670
that realm.
Dude,

3225
02:19:31,730 --> 02:19:34,430
I list some feedback.
He's a,

3226
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:36,680
everyone's like,
what the fuck are they talking about?

3227
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:37,553
Right.
Everyone gets different compliments 

3228
02:19:38,211 --> 02:19:38,901
different.
Right?

3229
02:19:38,901 --> 02:19:39,810
Like so,
so,

3230
02:19:39,970 --> 02:19:40,803
so gross compliment.
He always gets like sugar is not 

3231
02:19:42,411 --> 02:19:44,390
approachable.
Like no one says hi to him.

3232
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:50,200
Oh he looks like surely bear.
So like whenever I'm with Siguro,

3233
02:19:50,790 --> 02:19:52,640
people are always like,
do one of two things.

3234
02:19:52,641 --> 02:19:53,600
They'll go like,
oh shit,

3235
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:54,590
the machine.
And I'm like,

3236
02:19:54,591 --> 02:19:55,070
what's up?
They're like,

3237
02:19:55,070 --> 02:19:57,020
well we god cause I get a picture with 
your shirt off.

3238
02:19:57,021 --> 02:19:57,561
I'm like,
of course,

3239
02:19:57,561 --> 02:19:58,394
of course.
So I take my shirt off in public with 

3240
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:03,450
your shirt off today.
Four Times.

3241
02:20:04,210 --> 02:20:06,470
Yeah.
And so and so.

3242
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:09,080
And then the,
then inevitably they'll go like,

3243
02:20:09,730 --> 02:20:11,780
oh hi Tom.
I'm a big fan.

3244
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:14,360
And then they'll just walk away.
Strange.

3245
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:17,720
And I find it approachable.
We were eating lunch one time,

3246
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:20,150
we're sitting at a table eating lunch 
and this guy sat next to us.

3247
02:20:20,151 --> 02:20:22,010
All a sudden he goes,
Holy Shit.

3248
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:23,870
He's like burt,
oh my God,

3249
02:20:23,871 --> 02:20:24,970
the machine I can't believe.
Like,

3250
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:26,930
and he's like,
you're eating lunch.

3251
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:27,920
What?
Tom's the girl.

3252
02:20:28,230 --> 02:20:29,050
Oh my God.

3253
02:20:29,050 --> 02:20:30,320
I'm like a fan of both of you guys.
Like,

3254

Tom Goes,

3255
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:33,140

3256
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:36,020
Tom's like,

3257
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:38,000
He's like,
come on.

3258
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:40,130
He's like,
do you want to eat lunch?

3259
02:20:40,131 --> 02:20:41,660
If you want to sit and talk to this girl
day.

3260
02:20:41,661 --> 02:20:43,520
And I'm like,
Oh I,

3261
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:46,400
I love that.
So bill a bill gets,

3262
02:20:46,401 --> 02:20:47,510
this is what Bill Gates,
right?

3263
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:49,610
So I get like to take your shirt off.
I want to get a shot.

3264
02:20:49,630 --> 02:20:50,463
Yeah.
People look at soccer and they're like 

3265
02:20:51,170 --> 02:20:54,250
legit.
One Fan said to him on,

3266
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:56,150
I'm not even joking on Instagram,
said,

3267
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:57,193
Hey Tom,
I saw you in the airport and I nodded 

3268
02:20:59,241 --> 02:21:00,074
and I apologize,
I didn't want to introduce interview 

3269
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:05,930
inner inner like hit your space.
But I am a big fan and Tom's like,

3270
02:21:05,931 --> 02:21:08,480
thank you by the way.
It comes down and he's a nice guy,

3271
02:21:08,481 --> 02:21:09,360
but like you see him,
you're saying,

3272
02:21:09,361 --> 02:21:10,610
I would be like,
Oh hey,

3273
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:12,430
he's not a Dick,
you know that we be.

3274
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:15,170
But Bill Gates,
Bill Gates,

3275
02:21:15,171 --> 02:21:18,980
guys who literally walk up like hands 
folded,

3276
02:21:18,981 --> 02:21:20,780
like,
like they're meeting and they're like,

3277
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:21,793
sir,
you're the greatest thing for our 

3278
02:21:23,440 --> 02:21:25,340
generation.
I mean the way your mind works.

3279
02:21:25,990 --> 02:21:27,120
And then the literature though,
he was like,

3280
02:21:27,220 --> 02:21:28,550
I've no idea who you are.
I apologize.

3281
02:21:28,551 --> 02:21:32,310
But you were having them bills like,
thank you,

3282
02:21:34,180 --> 02:21:36,960
thank you very much.
Wow.

3283
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:39,703
Respect godfathers.
Back to his brain is his brain works 

3284
02:21:42,921 --> 02:21:44,310
like,
well that's when I had snow.

3285
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:46,010
His podcast.
It's like he's doing,

3286
02:21:46,980 --> 02:21:50,150
but he's just talking about his day and 
I'm just like,

3287
02:21:50,151 --> 02:21:52,550
how the fuck is this?
So funny dude,

3288
02:21:52,551 --> 02:21:56,410
he's just talking about his day and he's
like feeling like,

3289
02:21:56,690 --> 02:21:58,010
I'm like,
did he write this?

3290
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:59,150
He said,
no,

3291
02:21:59,150 --> 02:22:02,120
our epic,
his latest going in,

3292
02:22:02,121 --> 02:22:05,630
was it his legs?
He was great.

3293
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:07,190
He,
someone wrote back,

3294
02:22:07,660 --> 02:22:08,493
no bill guy.
I got bill I like was harassing him and 

3295
02:22:11,151 --> 02:22:12,830
we got them to use instagram.
Right.

3296
02:22:12,831 --> 02:22:15,950
So he starts using instagram by the way.
It's like your dad using instagram.

3297
02:22:15,951 --> 02:22:16,784
He's like,
this is the sandwich I'm having for 

3298
02:22:18,021 --> 02:22:21,890
lunch and so on instagram he was like,
God,

3299
02:22:21,891 --> 02:22:25,040
Greg Conan tonight or this shirt and now
it's in the rotation.

3300
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:25,883
We got lucky shirt

3301
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:27,210
and I was like,
okay,

3302
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:30,000
if bill burr thinks he's got a lucky 
shirt,

3303
02:22:30,001 --> 02:22:31,890
that must be a murderer.
Risk owning.

3304
02:22:35,360 --> 02:22:36,960
Yeah.
He's on Youtube.

3305
02:22:36,961 --> 02:22:38,850
The clip.
If you don't watch the whole damn thing.

3306
02:22:38,910 --> 02:22:39,421
Oh yeah.
I'm going to,

3307
02:22:39,421 --> 02:22:40,254
I'm going to watch it tonight.
I'm going to want to go down to the 

3308
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:42,773
autonomous it.
Oh,

3309
02:22:43,090 --> 02:22:43,923
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

3310
02:22:45,630 --> 02:22:47,240
We've done that.
We're done.

3311
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:48,760
Really?
How long I'm going,

3312
02:22:48,761 --> 02:22:52,200
it's over two hours by the first one we 
did was three hours.

3313
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:56,850
Even to today is probably still one of 
the longest ones were real.

3314
02:22:57,030 --> 02:23:00,000
I think the longest one we've done was 
like the chair.

3315
02:23:00,001 --> 02:23:01,800
Do you want that was like five hours.
Like Oh really?

3316
02:23:02,240 --> 02:23:05,640
And that was this first poll.
How long was that?

3317
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:07,710
Oh,
like three and a half.

3318
02:23:07,930 --> 02:23:10,430
I was,
we were drinking.

3319
02:23:11,220 --> 02:23:12,060
Really?
Yeah,

3320
02:23:12,061 --> 02:23:13,830
that was,
that was the drinking one,

3321
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,780
but he drinks bud lights,
so,

3322
02:23:15,930 --> 02:23:16,763
oh,
so it's like,

3323
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:17,380
yeah.

3324
02:23:17,380 --> 02:23:20,170
Yeah.
We were hot box.

3325
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:23,100
This room with cigarettes.
It was really,

3326
02:23:24,370 --> 02:23:25,203
hey,
what's going on with the Logan Paul j 

3327
02:23:25,960 --> 02:23:26,910
Pia Ksi.
Fuck.

3328
02:23:27,250 --> 02:23:30,360
I'm fascinated.
I can't wait to watch it.

3329
02:23:32,070 --> 02:23:32,903
Oh,
it's this Saturday.

3330
02:23:33,290 --> 02:23:34,610
You going to pay per view it?
No,

3331
02:23:34,611 --> 02:23:35,650
I'm working.
I'm just,

3332
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:39,240
I'm working and it's Ellis.
You're going to have this Sunday.

3333
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:40,830
You have to cancel your show.
Yeah,

3334
02:23:41,070 --> 02:23:42,120
guys,
I'm so sorry.

3335
02:23:42,940 --> 02:23:43,700
No,
nothing.

3336
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:47,280
You guys know who this is Logan Paul,
but KSI.

3337
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:49,350
I thought his name was PSI.
I was like,

3338
02:23:50,970 --> 02:23:53,100
wow,
this is kind of a cool box name.

3339
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:53,953
What did you like this Saturday?
We're going to have to cancel my plans 

3340
02:23:56,980 --> 02:24:01,860
and I'll look at Paul.
Really?

3341
02:24:01,861 --> 02:24:02,551
Yeah.
I think he's,

3342
02:24:02,551 --> 02:24:04,580
I think he's got,
he's got,

3343
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:05,423
I think Ksi really because he has 
experience and I think he takes it more 

3344
02:24:10,051 --> 02:24:10,884
seriously low.
The fault doesn't have experience doing 

3345
02:24:13,650 --> 02:24:15,780
shit.
Okay.

3346
02:24:16,540 --> 02:24:19,620
KCI has had one boxing match that he 
won.

3347
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:21,960
He's been training.
He's very serious.

3348
02:24:21,961 --> 02:24:24,060
He doesn't even make youtube videos.
Logan Paul's being cute.

3349
02:24:24,061 --> 02:24:27,390
He's making youtube videos.
Case site is fucking grinding.

3350
02:24:27,590 --> 02:24:29,160
Do you know they're going to do one in 
la?

3351
02:24:29,490 --> 02:24:30,760
They're going to do another one.
Yeah.

3352
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:35,880
We're going to send you a rematch,
but there's just no,

3353
02:24:35,881 --> 02:24:36,331
no.
Yeah.

3354
02:24:36,331 --> 02:24:37,164
It's a rematch.
We're going to send like Joey Salads 

3355
02:24:40,471 --> 02:24:42,410
out.
You know Joey Joey's house.

3356
02:24:42,450 --> 02:24:46,280
[inaudible].

3357
02:24:46,880 --> 02:24:51,750
He's the legend I love is that just 
cheered me.

3358
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:54,180
I love Joey Salads.
People don't like that.

3359
02:24:54,181 --> 02:24:55,110
I'm friends with Tim,
but I'm like,

3360
02:24:55,111 --> 02:24:56,850
listen,
he's the original salad head.

3361
02:24:57,740 --> 02:25:00,150
He's a lovable,
you might be an yet.

3362
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:05,050
He might have put a stick in a hot dog 
bun walk Mesa like,

3363
02:25:05,370 --> 02:25:06,330
oh,
that's so great.

3364
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:11,250
I think we'll case Logan Paul is bigger 
and heavier apparently.

3365
02:25:11,251 --> 02:25:12,084
I mean that counts for a lot of law,
but ultimately I'm pretty sure it's 

3366
02:25:16,141 --> 02:25:19,170
gonna be boring and go the whole 
distance and be,

3367
02:25:19,350 --> 02:25:21,660
you know,
determined by Joe Boring because they're

3368
02:25:21,661 --> 02:25:23,110
not yours.
What did they know?

3369
02:25:23,111 --> 02:25:24,040
They're going to go in and

3370
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:26,560
do the stuff that like,
like they learned like Jab,

3371
02:25:26,561 --> 02:25:27,101
Jab,
Jab,

3372
02:25:27,101 --> 02:25:28,000
Jab,
punch,

3373
02:25:28,001 --> 02:25:28,720
Jab,
Jab.

3374
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:29,553
If they went in like one of those,
like we used to do ahc sprawl in 

3375
02:25:31,421 --> 02:25:33,730
college.
We're just frat boys with no training,

3376
02:25:33,731 --> 02:25:34,564
just going in with drives and they were 
just throwing haymakers just all be 

3377
02:25:38,531 --> 02:25:43,531
gassed out after 45 seconds,
like you know,

3378
02:25:46,210 --> 02:25:48,280
and shape.
But I think they're just not,

3379
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:50,290
they're not professional fighters.
What can you expect?

3380
02:25:50,590 --> 02:25:51,900
Well you figure if they're training 
them,

3381
02:25:51,910 --> 02:25:54,760
maybe I've gotten a little bit,
Ellis mania is this week,

3382
02:25:55,150 --> 02:25:55,983
Jason Ellis has a show on Sirius xm and 
two of my friends were fighting Ryan 

3383
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,200
O'Neal and Louis J.
Gomez,

3384
02:26:02,470 --> 02:26:04,910
but they're doing mma,
they're doing Jujitsu and mean.

3385
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:08,890
And so that's the one that I'm really 
interested in because Louis J.

3386
02:26:08,890 --> 02:26:10,990
Gomez,
like if they're both comedians,

3387
02:26:10,991 --> 02:26:13,690
but he like left the comedy launch and 
it was like,

3388
02:26:13,710 --> 02:26:14,130
oh,
I'm going to,

3389
02:26:14,130 --> 02:26:15,010
I'm going to fucking kill him.

3390
02:26:15,190 --> 02:26:17,170
And like,
and Ryan and Neil's like,

3391
02:26:17,171 --> 02:26:17,981
hey,
it's going to be fun.

3392
02:26:17,981 --> 02:26:18,940
Right.
We're gonna have a good time.

3393
02:26:19,660 --> 02:26:22,330
Where did the fight come from?
From a rivalry or what?

3394
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:25,240
What is it?
I think Ari Shaffir is friends with both

3395
02:26:25,241 --> 02:26:27,220
of them and I think he started it.
He was like,

3396
02:26:27,250 --> 02:26:28,660
oh,
he'd knock you out Louis.

3397
02:26:28,870 --> 02:26:29,703
Oh Wow.
And then Louis is Puerto Rican and he's 

3398
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:32,120
like,
oh fuck.

3399
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:33,910
His nickname is a Puerto Rican 
rattlesnake.

3400
02:26:34,150 --> 02:26:37,630
He's like,
and he's this week to this week too.

3401
02:26:38,050 --> 02:26:40,870
It's a big week.
Sit down over this week.

3402
02:26:41,020 --> 02:26:41,860
I know.
Tell me,

3403
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:44,100
I can't wait.
I can't wait.

3404
02:26:44,480 --> 02:26:46,780
Best thing about Netflix is I don't 
care.

3405
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:49,150
Like if my special aired on Saturday,
I'd be like,

3406
02:26:49,180 --> 02:26:51,280
fuck,
I'm losing all these viewers.

3407
02:26:51,580 --> 02:26:53,120
They're never going to see it again.
But on Netflix,

3408
02:26:53,130 --> 02:26:54,970
so like dude,
go watch all this shit.

3409
02:26:55,180 --> 02:26:58,520
And then Sunday at two o'clock in the 
afternoon when you're hung over and make

3410
02:26:58,530 --> 02:26:59,080
a beat yourself up.

3411
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:00,250
Mimosa,
I'd watched my special,

3412
02:27:00,251 --> 02:27:03,010
it's the best thing about Netflix and 
Netflix in Israel now.

3413
02:27:03,310 --> 02:27:06,040
Really?
We waited so long in Israel,

3414
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:07,360
the minute we left.
Oh,

3415
02:27:07,361 --> 02:27:11,590
Netflix in Israel too.
I watched this guy,

3416
02:27:11,620 --> 02:27:14,050
I watch this guy on Netflix,
I don't know his name,

3417
02:27:14,051 --> 02:27:15,730
he's Korean.
He's got white hair.

3418
02:27:15,731 --> 02:27:17,800
Right?
And he doesn't speak English,

3419
02:27:17,801 --> 02:27:18,634
but he does stand up and I watched like 
15 minutes of his special just mouth 

3420
02:27:23,241 --> 02:27:24,640
open like,
Huh?

3421
02:27:25,540 --> 02:27:26,620
I'm like,
hi.

3422
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:28,630
And then I'm like,
I want more of that.

3423
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:32,320
I want,
I want straight up Palestinian comics,

3424
02:27:32,490 --> 02:27:35,520
like doing horrible racist Jewish jokes.
Oh.

3425
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:37,373
And then the Jewish people doing in 
their own Netflix to air all of the 

3426
02:27:42,490 --> 02:27:45,210
Somali pirates who do stand up door like
you're like,

3427
02:27:45,950 --> 02:27:47,350

3428
02:27:47,351 --> 02:27:48,184
Boarding of a cruise ship accident.

3429
02:27:55,451 --> 02:27:56,284

Look at this.

3430
02:27:57,340 --> 02:27:59,740
I was about to say something.
I got stopped dead in my tracks.

3431
02:27:59,890 --> 02:28:00,723
Oh,
pause.

3432
02:28:02,130 --> 02:28:04,360
And his eyes are about to close.
He can jump too.

3433
02:28:04,420 --> 02:28:05,140
Yeah,
he's quick.

3434
02:28:05,140 --> 02:28:07,140
He's nimble.
So we got to,

3435
02:28:07,160 --> 02:28:08,990

We've got to play in dinner with me.

3436
02:28:08,991 --> 02:28:10,230
You told me to push him away.

biggest fears that he's going to get.

3443

I will pause in it.
I just was like,

3479

You guys have a great weekend.

3506

we're going to look for what do you guys
leave tomorrow morning?

3510
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:26,940
I was thinking about going after the 
show,

3511
02:31:26,941 --> 02:31:27,774
but I was like,
ma'am,

3512
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:30,510
type of leave in the middle of the 
night.

3513
02:31:31,770 --> 02:31:32,603
Crash on the test.
My wasn't a call it the one wife and I 

3514
02:31:34,261 --> 02:31:35,610
did that one time.
We got camping gear.

3515
02:31:35,610 --> 02:31:36,570
We went all,
but we were like,

3516
02:31:36,571 --> 02:31:37,710
we still can't to this weekend.
She goes,

3517
02:31:37,980 --> 02:31:42,300
let's not get caught in the traffic.
Let's go buy all this stuff now.

3518
02:31:42,510 --> 02:31:43,343
We'll get everything ready and we'll 
leave at like midnight of like during 

3519
02:31:45,751 --> 02:31:47,580
the middle of the night.
And I go,

3520
02:31:47,581 --> 02:31:51,390
great idea by horse stuff at sports 
chalet thousand dollars with the camping

3521
02:31:51,391 --> 02:31:52,770
gear.
Get on the five,

3522
02:31:52,771 --> 02:31:53,604
start driving up to Yosemite.
We got to go to the bathroom and it's 

3523
02:31:55,651 --> 02:31:57,300
like 30 degrees and she's like,
wait,

3524
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:58,433
what was the 10 bridges before cell 
phones were big show wonder what the 

3525
02:32:00,331 --> 02:32:01,840
temperature and Yosemite is.
No,

3526
02:32:02,130 --> 02:32:04,560
we get online,
it's like 10 degrees.

3527
02:32:04,561 --> 02:32:06,980
We're like,
oh,

3528
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:10,100
we never thought to check temperatures

3529
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:14,140
to Santa Cruz.
We got fucked hard.

3530
02:32:14,350 --> 02:32:16,090
That navigation.
We have a tesla,

3531
02:32:16,430 --> 02:32:17,263
which is part of the story.
I'm not saying that to brag part of the 

3532
02:32:19,390 --> 02:32:20,223
story.
Okay,

3533
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:21,730
sorry.
They had to say that.

3534
02:32:22,090 --> 02:32:25,090
But the navigation,
it doesn't use google maps so it doesn't

3535
02:32:25,120 --> 02:32:28,120
have traffic updates.
Okay.

3536
02:32:28,470 --> 02:32:29,303
And part of the,
so we driving up the one which for 

3537
02:32:31,691 --> 02:32:34,420
anyone that isn't familiar,
it's a road that goes all the way up the

3538
02:32:34,421 --> 02:32:35,800
coast of California.
It's really,

3539
02:32:35,860 --> 02:32:38,320
there's a point from like,
uh,

3540
02:32:38,530 --> 02:32:41,470
the center of California up to Santa 
Cruz,

3541
02:32:41,471 --> 02:32:44,110
which is about two hours in the 
mountains.

3542
02:32:44,230 --> 02:32:47,110
No reception.
There's basically,

3543
02:32:47,111 --> 02:32:49,330
it's a really beautiful nature drive,
but you're,

3544
02:32:49,930 --> 02:32:50,763
there's one road and that's it.
And so were the navigation is taking up 

3545
02:32:54,250 --> 02:32:58,630
up this road and about halfway up 
there's just one lady sitting there in a

3546
02:32:58,631 --> 02:33:01,090
lawn chair.
One lady in the middle of the road,

3547
02:33:01,091 --> 02:33:01,924
she's like,
Hey,

3548
02:33:02,070 --> 02:33:04,990
you got to turn around the road,
fell into the ocean.

3549
02:33:05,410 --> 02:33:06,243
You can't drive this way.
And apparently the road has been closed 

3550
02:33:08,951 --> 02:33:13,540
for a long fucking time and the Tesla,
which is run powered by battery.

3551
02:33:13,570 --> 02:33:15,370
Okay,
there's no fuck.

3552
02:33:15,490 --> 02:33:16,390
You can't be like,
Hey,

3553
02:33:16,391 --> 02:33:17,650
do you have a,
can I get a little gap?

3554
02:33:18,520 --> 02:33:22,990
You've got a battery and thankfully we 
charged right before going up the one,

3555
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:25,330
but like if we went up there and didn't 
charge,

3556
02:33:25,540 --> 02:33:27,380
it would have been in there in a 
fucking,

3557
02:33:28,130 --> 02:33:28,963
we had to drive back.
By the time we got back it was empty 

3558
02:33:30,801 --> 02:33:32,240
again.
Then you've got to charge it.

3559
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:35,920
Lucky that we charged the right before 
because there's no reception,

3560
02:33:36,940 --> 02:33:38,260
no fucking gas.

3561
02:33:38,330 --> 02:33:40,090
What was you have to do with,
you have to get your car towed.

3562
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:40,990
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

3563
02:33:41,320 --> 02:33:42,880
I Dunno.
Your Tesla was like a,

3564
02:33:42,910 --> 02:33:46,300
like a teenage boy with his head sets on
the seventh house fire.

3565
02:33:51,140 --> 02:33:51,973
This scene,
there was this one lady sitting in a 

3566
02:33:55,251 --> 02:33:57,080
lawn chair in the middle of fucking 
nowhere

3567
02:33:59,160 --> 02:34:01,360
world fell into the ocean.
I was like,

3568
02:34:01,410 --> 02:34:02,243
oh,
okay.

3569
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:04,330
Oh my God.
I was like,

3570
02:34:04,331 --> 02:34:06,340
fuck.
Same thing would happen with gas,

3571
02:34:06,341 --> 02:34:07,174
but there's no gas stations around you,
but you could like siphon some off or 

3572
02:34:10,241 --> 02:34:12,790
you could wait for someone.
What can come.

3573
02:34:12,940 --> 02:34:13,773
I guess someone could just bring you 
ring up gas as opposed to just like an 

3574
02:34:15,850 --> 02:34:18,220
external charger for your,
plug it into your car.

3575
02:34:18,221 --> 02:34:22,270
Like how do you call for a tow truck?
How do you do that?

3576
02:34:23,050 --> 02:34:26,620
Oh cause you can't even charge it and 
yeah,

3577
02:34:26,621 --> 02:34:29,620
there's no exception here and there.
I was like,

3578
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:30,880
wow,
I don't know what you do.

3579
02:34:31,960 --> 02:34:32,793
I think that's when you start,
you just jump because you take the 

3580
02:34:35,141 --> 02:34:37,000
insulation out of it and you start 
building a fire.

3581
02:34:40,150 --> 02:34:42,590
Total survival mode and less driving by 
cars.

3582
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:45,040
All these cars driving turnaround with 
gas powered.

3583
02:34:45,130 --> 02:34:46,050
Yeah.
Well he's,

3584
02:34:46,090 --> 02:34:47,710
that's what you guys just moved there 
and get a job.

3585
02:34:48,120 --> 02:34:51,030
You start selling a course,
beating us on the side of the road.

3586
02:34:51,080 --> 02:34:52,920
They don't care.
Turn the ground.

3587
02:34:55,390 --> 02:34:56,980
There you go.
We'll work together.

3588
02:35:00,250 --> 02:35:04,570
She's sitting next to her.
Oh,

3589
02:35:04,750 --> 02:35:07,770
I can do this all fucking night,
guys.

3590
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:10,630
Have a great weekend.
Next week is Tim Heidecker.

3591
02:35:10,631 --> 02:35:12,820
Right.
Pretty excited.

3592
02:35:13,090 --> 02:35:15,600
Holy Shit.
It's going to be awesome.

3593
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:18,250
So we'll see.
We'll see how that one,

3594
02:35:19,450 --> 02:35:20,283
sorry ladies.
We parked our jet skis outside from the 

3595
02:35:24,610 --> 02:35:29,280
APP.
Oh,

3596
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:33,940
awesome.
So we will see you then and have a great

3597
02:35:33,941 --> 02:35:35,620
fucking weekend.
God dammit.

3598
02:35:35,950 --> 02:35:39,520
She good time.
See you guys on Tuesday,

3599
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:39,641
Tuesday.
Oh,

3600
02:35:39,641 --> 02:35:40,061
right,
right.

3601
02:35:40,061 --> 02:35:41,170
We do episode on Tuesday.
Yeah,

3602
02:35:47,990 --> 02:35:48,823
no,

3603
02:35:50,530 --> 02:35:52,060
I was going to hit on with this 
soundbar.

3604
02:35:53,270 --> 02:35:54,103
Yeah.
