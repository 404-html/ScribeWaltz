1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,803
two.
Welcome to the age three podcasts 

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,660
extravaganza.
That's right.

4
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:13,740
We're an extravaganza now.
Thank you to 23 and me,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,753
postmates and hymns for sponsoring us 
and thank you to everybody for joining 

6
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:21,540
us today on this beautiful blessing frat
boy.

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:25,350
Do I love Fridays.
We started taking the weekends off and I

8
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:30,351
just get cut it on Fridays now.
Happy Friday to everyone watching.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,560
We've got a lot to discuss today.
We're very excited.

10
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:37,770
We've got some Shane up dates,
we've got some Papa John Updates.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,030
We've got uh,
some bouffy updates.

12
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:44,490
We've talked previously about a Gugu for
goofus slap,

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,910
slap,
boop,

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,933
boop,
a slap.

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,863
And Ian,
the intern has prepared for us one of 

16
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:55,491
his notorious much celebrated powerpoint
presentation on Dis ciphering,

17
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,990
the meaning of Kanye West.
Wow.

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,540
That's a big task.
But I know it was up for it.

19
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:05,130
But before we get into all of that,
I've got a little announcement.

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,060
Not really an announcement,
just something I wanted to talk about.

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,403
But it may be that Ila is,
is there's a new thing of the 

22
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:15,684
thickening.
It was going to be thickening up here 

23
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:20,310
soon.
What does that mean?

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,323
What I'm trying to say is that Isla 
won't be drinking alcohol if she's 

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,770
responsible.
What I'm trying to say?

26
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,980
Read podcasts.
Extravagant.

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,470
That's me.
Sorry.

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,423
Oh Jeez.

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,760
How long was that going?
Oh,

30
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:40,594
it just start like just now.
You turned it off immediately and 

31
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,290
flashback like,
no,

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,140
he lives,
there's two stripes.

33
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,790
She's cooking something up.
Anyone?

34
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,630
It's a cinnamon roll with rostain man 
Ula.

35
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:05,170
It's weird.
Just Bro.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
He loves,
uh,

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,540
there's something going on.
So we did it.

38
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,710
Well it's,
we,

39
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,220
we don't know yet if anything's gonna go
wrong.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,900
She's pregnant.

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,760
You look pregnant.
I have been,

42
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,430
I've been wording

43
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,460
and Isla for a year.
I mean,

44
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm just going frankly,
like a,

45
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,030
we've been to,
I've been,

46
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,040
I've been,
you know what I'm saying?

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,833
It's been on,
we've talked about it a lot on the 

48
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:48,150
podcast.
So it's a natural extension of our core,

49
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,083
of our efforts to get Ila knocked up.
And I have been a fully unchaste about 

50
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,980
two years.
Dick has been out

51
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,040
and wording.
We did the test,

52
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,720
we did everything.
But I'll say that we got,

53
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,930
it happened naturally and just the good 
old fashioned way you had sex grubs.

54
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,100
Yeah,
I know.

55
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,940
I know it is gross.
I Dunno.

56
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,580
I don't know.
I don't know how to feel about it.

57
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,760
Well,
just like two days ago,

58
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,410
two days ago we found out and Ila,
she will admit was a couple days late on

59
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,710
her period and her boobs,
Eh,

60
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,240
were Ra.
How would you say tender?

61
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,710
What your boobs were tender.
It just hurts.

62
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,780
I don't know yet.
Some tender as pity.

63
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,863
But anyway,
that's like what happens when you're 

64
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,560
getting the period and I remember it was
like a week earlier like,

65
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,650
oh,
I'm getting my period not happening.

66
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,940
And I was like,
what is going on?

67
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,270
And the night before I was like,
maybe you're pregnant jokingly.

68
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,620
Yeah.
And I was like,

69
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:58,570
actually I already checked on it was 
negative,

70
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,890
but it wasn't your first idea of the 
Morgan do it.

71
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,733
Right?
Yeah.

72
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,190
But it's interesting because the last 
two months we kind of doing really try,

73
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,900
we're like,
fuck this shit,

74
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,100
whatever.
If it happens,

75
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,430
it happens and we're just not going to 
pay attention.

76
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,680
Of course.
That's when it happened.

77
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,510
So funny.
Yeah,

78
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,690
of course.
And I don't know how to feel about it.

79
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:24,910
I'm scared.
I don't know how to feel about it.

80
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,720
It's terrifying.
I'm more scared than you because you got

81
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:31,910
to shit it.
I I'm not,

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,470
I have utmost respect for that.

83
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,363
I'm telling you that the,
and people always say like don't tell 

84
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,240
until,
I dunno.

85
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,700
I mean Israel even four months,
I don't know.

86
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,534
It's like,
but then you're going to see that I'm 

87
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:50,070
pregnant.
Like it was just superstitious,

88
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:52,180
you know,
or,

89
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,080
but you had a really good point about 
maybe something will go wrong,

90
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,280
but it's like if that happens then what?
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

91
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,840
Like it's a secret like,
yeah,

92
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:02,674
exactly.
You just carry this like sad thing you 

93
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:04,864
can do and you don't tell.
I guess the theory is I think first of 

94
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,160
all,
people are superstitious.

95
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,110
Second of all,
for those that don't know,

96
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,060
in the first like,
I dunno,

97
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,323
a couple of months,
it's very common that you could have a 

98
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:19,300
miscarriage and I didn't move.
Yeah.

99
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,370
Because it's like you don't talk about 
it.

100
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,970
Why not talk about it?
Like you'll say when you were sick,

101
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:25,900
you'll talk about it.

102
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,180
Yeah.
Or if you have to do a surgery.

103
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,850
So why is it that I'm like,
oh,

104
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:31,810
you're right.
And it's a,

105
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,020
it's a sad thing.
It's a vulnerable thing and it's kind of

106
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:36,940
sucks to just carry that sound.
Okay with you.

107
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:39,320
I mean,
but I,

108
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,383
I guess the theory is that yeah,
people would probably just are 

109
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,750
superstitious about it and then you 
have,

110
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,883
maybe it happens,
sometimes people have like many 

111
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,224
miscarriages.
It could happen like five times and 

112
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,560
you're like,
oh fuck,

113
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,394
I got to do this whole thing.
Like the whole congratulate were not 

114
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,830
pregnant.
We're pregnant,

115
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:58,070
we're not

116
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,903
putting,
you know,

117
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,223
but I'm,
Isla approached me a couple of days ago 

118
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,670
and she's like,
I was in bed just looking at the news or

119
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:06,290
something.
She's like,

120
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,840
eat.
Then we got a problem something.

121
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,170
And I didn't answer for a minute 
listening.

122
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,860
I'll just kind of groggy and he said 
something like two stripes.

123
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,560
And I was like,
what?

124
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,450
No Way.
Yeah.

125
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:23,270
When I did the test I felt like,
I felt like there's no way.

126
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,350
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

127
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:29,351
we've been trying for a while.
You know the boys can swim.

128
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,113
It's good to know though,
because it was kind of where I was 

129
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:34,910
worried that,
um,

130
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,101
we don't,
you worry.

131
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:37,610
That's what,
well,

132
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,690
what's wrong?
What's going on?

133
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,770
You know,
why can't I,

134
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,100
why can't,
why can't they get in there taking birth

135
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:46,540
control like maybe almost two years ago 
at this point?

136
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,950
So it could be,
that can take a while,

137
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:49,923
you know?

138
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,651
But,
uh,

139
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,780
so my,
so it worked.

140
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:54,614
The boys can swim,
the girls can catch and the team is 

141
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,860
functioning.
You know,

142
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,010
Ella started like a week ago before we 
knew she was preggo.

143
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,200
She's like,
I'm hungry.

144
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,240
Like,
yeah,

145
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,470
she started eating,
she had pizza and she's like,

146
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,500
and I have to tell you this,
this was shitty pizza.

147
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,550
And I'm not one to say that because 
pizza and my opinions like sex,

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,510
when it's good,
it's great and when it's bad it's pretty

149
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:23,840
good.
But I'm like,

150
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,940
this pizza is kind of sucky.
And he was like,

151
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:27,800
really?
This is the best pizza I've ever had.

152
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,310
And I'm just like,
are you feeling okay?

153
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,870
This piece is not that good.
I don't know why you tripping about it.

154
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,910
But I think ilos starting to get getting
hungry.

155
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,613
Hm.
I don't know if it's even happens that 

156
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:43,220
early,
but I can't,

157
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,310
I haven't been,
I don't know.

158
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,520
You said you feel something going on in 
your stomach?

159
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,093
Yeah,
I feel like things are moving in my 

160
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,384
stomach.

161
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,580
It's a fucking baby dude.
So anyway,

162
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,090
so guys don't tell anyone,
don't tell anyone please til 10 weeks.

163
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,280
So between all of us,
um,

164
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,620
and I don't know how to feel about it.
I mean we've been trying for a while,

165
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:14,000
but I was like just so used to not 
getting pregnant.

166
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,280
I was like,
oh cool.

167
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:17,150
I was like,
cool man,

168
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:22,151
fuck that shit.
But now I'm like,

169
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,670
I take care of a kid when I'm so 
dysfunctional.

170
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,580
Isla believes in me and that's all that 
matters.

171
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,893
Well,
anyway,

172
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,320
give us pregnant.
So there you have it at long.

173
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,780
Yes,
yes.

174
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,930
Thank you.
That is true.

175
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,730
That's how I feel.
Uh,

176
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,560
so we thought we'd share that happy news
with everybody and thank you for joining

177
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:47,660
us on this blessing Friday to share 
these beautiful,

178
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,330
wonderful news.
Me inside internally.

179
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,490
No,
I'm kidding.

180
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,480
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

181
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,970
Um,
let's move on.

182
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,180
We've got Shane now the shame 
documentary.

183
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,283
We had talked about it in a previous 
episode and I give Shane all the credit 

184
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:05,101
in the world.
I mean,

185
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:09,030
this guy has pioneered a new form of 
content on you.

186
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,103
Okay.
And he's got this incredible fan base 

187
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,960
and he,

188
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,490
the numbers are just like unpressed.
Unbelievable.

189
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,900
You had like 10 to 20 million that has 
600,000

190
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:22,410
lights

191
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,220
on a tweet.
Yeah.

192
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,690
What is going on?
Yeah,

193
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:26,710
it's wild.
So I mean,

194
00:09:26,711 --> 00:09:28,690
obviously hats off to the,
to the guy.

195
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:30,250
He's a friend of the show.
Even though,

196
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,530
even though,
even though he betrayed me after awhile.

197
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,163
Okay,
cut.

198
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,630
We're not yet.
We'll get there.

199
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,743
Yeah.
Not yet.

200
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,730
Let's at least get into a little bit 
before the possible father.

201
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,610
Yeah,
exactly.

202
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,520
Reliving the memory of that great 
betrayal.

203
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,910
Anyway,
so he goes on.

204
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:55,690
As we touched on in the last episode,
the chain starts exploring this theory.

205
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,900
What if Logan is the sociopath and Jake 
is living in the shadow of Logan.

206
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:02,314
The sociopath took a weird turn.
We're just all became about who is a 

207
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:10,040
sociopath.
Then like,

208
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,313
well the next episode was him sitting 
for like 40 or 50 minutes with a 

209
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:15,220
therapist

210
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,363
and

211
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,630
super dramatic kind of,

212
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:21,960
okay.

213
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,310
She's really dramatic,
kind of trying to diagnose him.

214
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,773
And

215
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,933
Anyway,
Logan Paul made a response video and I 

216
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:37,050
mean a lot of people have been 
criticizing Shane for his kind of,

217
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,230
the way that he's been trying to 
diagnose him.

218
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,383
Um,

219
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,040
cause he does this funny,
anything that's there,

220
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,800
him and his editor are really good at 
where they created this like a whore.

221
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,190
They create an atmosphere and a tension 
in the editing is very good.

222
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,113
They're good at it,
but it's like you're also talking about 

223
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,400
something serious.
You're talking about person,

224
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,850
you're talking about mental health.
And we know Paul Logan.

225
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:01,170
Paul,
which are like the two,

226
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,070
you know,
dom,

227
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,960
Youtube.
But regardless,

228
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:09,930
I'm not even trying to make a serious 
point about chain.

229
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,040
I don't,
I honestly,

230
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,640
I'm not here to refute or talk about 
any,

231
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,533
I honestly,
Logan Paul made a response video and 

232
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:20,550
it's given us,
us all here,

233
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,970
one of the best gems that have ever come
across this platform.

234
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:27,630
And so this to me was what was most 
important to share with you guys.

235
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,720
Um,
I'll let logan speak for himself now.

236
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,190
He,
he goes on the record,

237
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,540
he's,
and he actually says,

238
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,240
I'm not a sociopath,
but I do have sociopathic tendencies,

239
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,074
which is interesting.
It sounds like he's been diagnosed the 

240
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:44,490
way he talks about it because he's very 
knowledgeable and he goes,

241
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:50,030
you're not either a sociopath or not a 
sociopath is it's a sliding scale.

242
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:52,800
And some people have more sociopathic 
tendencies.

243
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,640
Yeah.
Others.

244
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,473
Um,
but he goes on to say something that 

245
00:11:56,771 --> 00:12:00,670
really resonated with me and made me 
really understand what he meant by that.

246
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:01,780
So I'll share it with you guys now.

247
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,830
It or sociopathic mark jobs.
Nope.

248
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,390
Steve Zuckerberg,
Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs.

249
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,253
A lot of people,
especially youtube tubers and Shane 

250
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,314
touched on this,
you can't just say like you're a 

251
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,534
sociopath.
The word I would like to use is 

252
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,920
sociopathic tendencies.
A lot of us,

253
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,250
me included,
we'll do some dumb shit.

254
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,210
Maybe some stuff that lacks empathy 
strictly for views,

255
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:28,044
right?
It gets US views which gets us 

256
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:31,860
subscribers are motivating factor.
If it's to reach the next,

257
00:12:31,861 --> 00:12:32,970
next,
next level.

258
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:33,804
Sociopath is boiled down.
Someone who is just more savage then 

259
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,040
everyone else.
I know it sounds

260
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,013
so that's it.
I mean that's pretty much a clinical 

261
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:44,444
definition of sociopath.
Somebody who is more savage than 

262
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:51,200
everybody else.
And um,

263
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,850
I think Logan for that definition and I 
just think,

264
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,470
and I'm just happy that that's in the 
world.

265
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Logan Paul saying it's just someone 
that's more savage than everybody else.

266
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,903
Dabble.
Dab.

267
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,410
Double Dab will do.
Yeah.

268
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,660
Motivating factor if it's to reach the 
next,

269
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:10,770
next,
next level.

270
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,633
Sociopath is boiled down.
Someone who is just more savage than 

271
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,470
everyone else.
I know,

272
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,710
I've just,
I have a,

273
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,563
I have trouble with that.
I'm having trouble with that comparison 

274
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,193
cause he's always making it cool for his
friends because they're always like 

275
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,890
Saburn yeah.
That's what savage means.

276
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:30,950
Cool.
Right.

277
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,650
His world.
So a Sociopath I think Aka ace,

278
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,580
antisocial personality disorder,
which is someone that lacks empathy.

279
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,110
Someone who has a general,
I mean I again,

280
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:45,190
I'm not going to,
it's not an,

281
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,440
it's not generally,
it's not,

282
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,020
I want to call it sad.
I won't call it savage necessarily.

283
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,330
You know,
maybe a psycho.

284
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,240
And then Ethan,
did you go through psychology school?

285
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,650
Cause I am not a,
I'm not a trained professional because I

286
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:05,770
don't know savage sounds to me it does 
sound very clinical.

287
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,480
Yeah.
That it sounds like something you'd hear

288
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:09,570
in a classroom.
Um,

289
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,280
this whole argument though,
that between him and Shane,

290
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:14,114
like it's just,
I feel like we shouldn't be this whole 

291
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:21,860
thing about self-diagnosing and I feel 
like even Logan's definition is wrong.

292
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,694
Cause I was trying to read about it 
online and educate myself a little bit 

293
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:25,754
before I came and did this podcast.
And apparently sociopathy isn't even a 

294
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:29,834
clinical term.
The real clinical term is antisocial 

295
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,900
personality disorder.
And it's just this whole messy thing.

296
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,910
I don't like that.
It's just,

297
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:38,744
I dunno

298
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,100
everyone always just google lang and 
self diagnosis.

299
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,510
Yeah.
And like,

300
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,520
but anyway,
Logan's defending himself.

301
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:47,290
He does make a lot of good points in 
here,

302
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,040
but I'm a sociopath is basically someone
that's more savage.

303
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,400
So to add that to the Wiki page.
Yeah.

304
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,950
Essentially we need to add that to the 
clinical definition of,

305
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,740
but it's someone that lacks empathy,
so much,

306
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:04,574
very manipulative.
Someone that doesn't mean they lack 

307
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,920
empathy,
they cannot relate with human emotion.

308
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:09,754
So it enables them to do more callous 
things that many of us will not feel 

309
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,610
comfortable doing from an empathetic 
standpoint.

310
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:21,430
And so I guess that would make them 
literally more savage and a psychopath,

311
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,363
which is a problem.
Shane kept saying a sociopath and a 

312
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,170
psychopath of the same thing and 
applying,

313
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,700
I don't think he said it's the same 
thing,

314
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:32,510
but he wasn't very clean and very like 
it kept mixing them up at some point,

315
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,573
which is,
well he would say sociopath and then he 

316
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:37,940
would show psychopath on the screen and 
like someone with a knife.

317
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,073
So I was reading about this,
trying to figure out what is the 

318
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:40,820
difference.

319
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,390
So actually all psychopaths are 
sociopaths,

320
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,200
but a psychopath is a more severe,
um,

321
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,010
version of a sociopath.
They tend to be more violent,

322
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:55,490
they tend to be more criminal and they 
tend to be more ruthless.

323
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,010
A sociopath can still have bonds with 
like family members and strong friends,

324
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,200
but random people and did the meet on 
the street.

325
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:07,790
They do not have any empathy for it all.
So there is a distinction,

326
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,940
but this implication that they're all,
you know,

327
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,140
creepy murders is not,
is not true.

328
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,690
But at any rate,
um,

329
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,190
at any rate,
that's that.

330
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,940
Then there was a part at the end of 
Shane's new,

331
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,090
I've,
I,

332
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,790
I'm checking out on this,
on this documentary.

333
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,230
Honestly,
it's so long.

334
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:28,640
It's too,
it's a lot.

335
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:30,620
But this part made me uncomfortable.
I'm not going to lie.

336
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,483
So he's teasing.
This one's called the enemies of Jake 

337
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,760
Paul and he is teasing.
And the next episode,

338
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:42,761
this therapist that he sat down with is 
going to go undercover as a producer.

339
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,473
Secretly.
They're not going to tell Jake Paul so 

340
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:50,660
that she can study him all day and make 
a diagnosis of him.

341
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,630
It seems kind of unethical.
It's just,

342
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,880
I mean if was all here,
here,

343
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:56,661
here it is.
I mean I,

344
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,040
the whole thing is making me 
uncomfortable.

345
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:58,874
Honestly.

346
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,003
Shane does acknowledge that.
I mean he knows that it's weird that 

347
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,840
still's going to do it.
But anyway,

348
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:12,674
here it is

349
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,570
and she's there the whole time.
I don't think he's going to be like,

350
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,360
I don't think it's going to be 
comfortable.

351
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:25,361
I think he's going to be kind of fake.
So I came up with a plan is I'm going to

352
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,870
the therapist to be,
he's going to be the whole day watching,

353
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,153
listening.

354
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:49,150
I love to shop,
wash this body language like a corner of

355
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:53,880
her eye.
Like that's how she makes her diagnosis.

356
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,950
Like she's,
this is her all day.

357
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,690
I just love the image of this therapist 
with them all day like this.

358
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,460
Just looking at the side of her vision 
at them anyway.

359
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,610
It's pretty with straight.
I don't know man.

360
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:15,780
It's shit strange.
Like,

361
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,050
I mean,
so here you,

362
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,030
it's like when the camera turns off 
throughout the day,

363
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,480
she's going to take me to another room.
Jake will have no idea.

364
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:26,560
And then we'll go on to the of the room.
I'll just be like going,

365
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,280
what do you think?
Well first of all,

366
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:30,500
let me say this g specifically.

367
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,773
There you go.
I Dunno.

368
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,570
It's weird.
It like,

369
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,940
I feel like it's unnecessary because if 
you,

370
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,080
if she went like jake would still be 
himself over a long day,

371
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,520
you know,
if they're at his house,

372
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,880
well you'll put on a show for like five 
minutes,

373
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:46,714
but eventually it'll be himself.
A sociopath apparently is capable and 

374
00:18:50,411 --> 00:18:53,230
well aware of the facade that they put 
on.

375
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,230
Actually what I read is that a 
psychopath,

376
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,483
so a sociopath generally is more messy 
and how they present themselves to the 

377
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:03,004
world.
But a psychopath is extremely efficient 

378
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,350
that they can have a mask up all the 
time,

379
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,820
even under stress and duress so that 
they never let their guard down.

380
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,310
Yeah.
So it is one of the attributes.

381
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,370
But that being said,
I really don't think Jerry is like,

382
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,240
I really don't think jake is a sociopath
talking about Jake Paul.

383
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,060
Yeah,
I,

384
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,710
the thing is he didn't really need this 
whole angle.

385
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,780
I would have been interested at just 
one,

386
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:31,420
a really sincere look and to Jake Paul's
life.

387
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,160
Like I don't know why they were down.
Yeah.

388
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,750
I don't know that we needed this really 
dramatic angle of sociopathy.

389
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,040
Yeah,
yeah.

390
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,423
Cutie pie made a video about it.
He made some good points about a really 

391
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:45,760
long video,
but he was like,

392
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:46,594
when they were talking about sociopathy,
him and the therapist were saying that 

393
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:51,910
it was like icky and gross,
I guess.

394
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,090
I don't know what do I know?
But it's getting bizarre.

395
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,620
It's a wild ride,
man.

396
00:19:59,621 --> 00:20:02,680
This is some wild new territory here.
People are loving it.

397
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,540
Yeah.
And the thing is,

398
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,110
it's Jake Paul,
so it's hard for anyone to be like,

399
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,930
it's very difficult to ever take cake or
logan site.

400
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,773
Like Logan made a very reasonable 
response to two chainz video and it has 

401
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:21,820
like,
firstly,

402
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,860
yeah,
he did.

403
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,770
Like I was,
I was feeling kind of bad that like here

404
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,370
they're down.
Votes is like 130,000

405
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:34,840
down and he didn't really say anything 
or did they have a downvote personally?

406
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:36,670
My pain,
that's the world we live in.

407
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,690
That's the tube we tube in and so uh,
I'm not going to lie.

408
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,420
I'm going to watch it.
I'm going to watch it.

409
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,270
It seems unethical but I'm going to 
watch the fuck out of it.

410
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,740
What else?
We got Kevin.

411
00:20:56,741 --> 00:21:00,520
Ugh,
Kevin on this fucking guy,

412
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,413
this cabinet guy.
He's trying to get on the supreme court 

413
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,590
again,
there's a lot of politics going on here.

414
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:09,780
You guys probably heard of Kevin Hawk 
and how he was accused of all this.

415
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:13,660
A sexual misconduct which is sexual 
misconduct.

416
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:16,690
That's a nice way of saying rape kind 
of,

417
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,700
but regardless of what he did or didn't 
do,

418
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:20,740
I don't know.
My only interest in this,

419
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:25,741
my friends is the fact that they are 
arguing over what is a booth now goofing

420
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,560
is a big part of this show.
As you may recall,

421
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,770
we have been trying to get to the bottom
of what a booth is for a long time.

422
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,740
I feel bad for that.
Right into the equation.

423
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,750
A booth and a goof and a gaf is alive.

424
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,790
What happens if you booth a goof?
Now we were wondering what's a booth and

425
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:43,624
Eric from common etiquette came in with 
a definition as we were wondering what 

426
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:48,700
is a boob?
And I look it up,

427
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:51,880
it's not actually a word,
but you found it on urban dictionary the

428
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:52,714
best,
which is the perfect place to define 

429
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:55,654
something like this apparently,
and correct me if your definition is 

430
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:00,520
wrong,
it's when you shove drugs up your ass,

431
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,760
when you go to a rave or dance party,
you boost it in.

432
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,063
We're on the same page.
So actually I've got to revive that 

433
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:09,664
definitional that I'm pretty sure it 
means taking drugs up the ass because 

434
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,490
what I've heard,
yeah,

435
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,270
because apparently the,
the anus,

436
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:17,104
the colon is very absorbed.
Absorbative absorbative and so drinking 

437
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:23,880
is like,
you know,

438
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,070
and it's like you're doing an Ama,
we'd all be like this,

439
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:28,660
you know,
this man where it's like I sleep,

440
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,650
I am awake.
So drinking alcohol in the mouth,

441
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,400
I sleep booping alcohol and your ass.
I'm awake.

442
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,090
Yes.
So basically the,

443
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,780
the aim anus sucks and as way more 
membrane.

444
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:47,230
So if you're taking any kind of elicit 
drug,

445
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,270
you put it up the ass boy and you all 
going to be get taken that one rate,

446
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,270
right ticket to Valhalla.
If you're willing to do that,

447
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,480
you don't have to taste it.
You don't have to encounter any beds.

448
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,700
You just boof it right up there.
What do you shotgun a beer up your ass.

449
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:08,290
I don't know how that works.
I heard there was kids that were dipping

450
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:12,160
vodka or tampons in vodka and then 
shoving it up their ass.

451
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,023
They get drunk.
It's like she's just drinking his 

452
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,520
drinking.
Um,

453
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,580
but apparently you get drunk quicker and
it's a pleasant experience.

454
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,870
But I just,
I love,

455
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,003
you know,
postman is really good at shotgunning 

456
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,700
beers.
I don't know how fast you can boot it.

457
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,273
Didn't a friend of the show Steevo uh,
in one of those jackass movies moved to 

458
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,020
a beer out of like a beer bong.

459
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,110
That's what I'd like to see post malone 
done.

460
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,800
I think that's the next rockstar that,
um,

461
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,910
I just like to imagine someone on their 
back with their cheeks out in a bunch of

462
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:51,911
Bros shoving that tube up.
Dude's ass and vaseline ended up by tyra

463
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,580
banks and I'm just boof and a beer right
up the stink hall.

464
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,220
What was their ranks doing?
She's the vaseline goddess.

465
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,800
Shannon,
your picture of she,

466
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,970
they use vaseline from her.
It's the good stuff.

467
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,470
Yeah.
If,

468
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,500
if Austin is going to be goofing any 
beers,

469
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,513
I want to make sure he gets the best 
vaseline to lube that Ayn is up because 

470
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:17,840
that's obvious.
So much easier than drinking it.

471
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:19,100
But at any rate,
let's watch,

472
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,293
let's watch a future Supreme Court 
justice discuss boofy and this is the 

473
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:28,790
greatest time.
What have you,

474
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,250
I don't know if it's booked or buffed 
files.

475
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,940
Do you pronounce that Trevor?
First of flatulence?

476
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,680
No,
it does not refer to flashlights a.

477
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,360
We all know,
even if you support this guy,

478
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,780
you know that this guy is not talking 
about flatulence.

479
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,810
So fights,
alliances,

480
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:52,230
the farm when in and guys,
and again,

481
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:54,740
I'm not taking sides.
I'm not throwing my shit.

482
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,360
I don't,
I'm so over politics.

483
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,940
Okay,
I'm here for the boots and the boots,

484
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,520
but we all know,
all of us watching,

485
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:06,410
even those of you who support cavenaugh 
and everything he does,

486
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,490
you know,
whatever.

487
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:11,180
What the fuck ever.
You know what a booth is

488
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,940
and this man,
did they ever get to what a goof is?

489
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,060
They didn't ask that.
Michelle was there.

490
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:22,330
I'd tell them what is a goof?
Define a goof.

491
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:24,430
It's Kinda hard to define.
It's a laugh.

492
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,880
Giggle,
giggle.

493
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,460
Um,
this guy,

494
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:32,950
if he goes down for lying about what a 
boof is,

495
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,250
perjury.
Now we've made America great again.

496
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,230
I mean,
he lied to the Senate.

497
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,041
I mean,
right here.

498
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,550
We all know what a brewery,
right?

499
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,050
It's perjury of the highest order.
We've all,

500
00:25:44,051 --> 00:25:44,884
everyone here who is a fan of this 
podcast and listens here on regular 

501
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:47,974
basis in your deposition that they asked
you to define what a meme is very 

502
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:55,540
similar moment.
Meme is kind of hard to define.

503
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,620
A booth has a very literal definition is
not a flatulence.

504
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,300
Flatulence.
No,

505
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:02,134
it does not,
but I'm saying that we've all here 

506
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:08,470
who've been a fan of washed along and 
learned along with us.

507
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,330
We all learned together.
What is goofing.

508
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,333
Yeah,
and this judge who wants to sit on the 

509
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:18,520
highest court in the world,

510
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,210
he committed perjury over what it means 
to put beer up his ass.

511
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,440
He should go down for that.
I'm saying if you're showing us like,

512
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,160
I haven't ever heard that he's a nice 
word for partying.

513
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,900
Yeah.
He's went to Yale so he's not allowed to

514
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:40,660
say fart.
He has to say flatulence,

515
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,853
but what have you.
It's just like that's when you put up 

516
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:47,670
your ass that the,
because they'd be like,

517
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:50,610
look,
I was 15 I was 16 years old.

518
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,560
We were young boys.
It's a joke.

519
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:56,610
It's what happens is putting beer up 
your ass and get him more credit.

520
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,790
Would people be like,
that guy's telling the fucking truth.

521
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,930
You wouldn't lie about that.
I mean,

522
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:07,390
I guess he was trying to be more for 
him.

523
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,040
He kept trying to downplay his drinking.
So that's what it was.

524
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,390
He's always trying to be like,
oh,

525
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:13,224
nothing.
And there has anything to do with 

526
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:16,910
drinking.
Look Dude,

527
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,980
you put some,
you,

528
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,920
you took some beer up the ass.
I get it,

529
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,150
man.
We're all trying to have fun.

530
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,680
You were a young man at the time.

531
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,570
Yup.
By the way,

532
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:29,650
this guy's name is Mr.
White House.

533
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:35,490
I wonder what kind of job that goes 
after my jam in a president called Mr.

534
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,380
White House President White House.
This just in from the White House.

535
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,800
Like a papa,
John,

536
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,740
Papa Johns,
Papa Johns,

537
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,420
Papa Johns,
Papa John.

538
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:46,254
Dot.
Papa John.

539
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,113
Anyway,
I just loved that booth thing has been 

540
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:51,970
the center of a national controversy and
uh,

541
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,460
I had to acknowledge it.
So judge,

542
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,510
hmm shouldn't have lied about the booth 
thing.

543
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,310
First of flatulence with does not.
Absolutely does not.

544
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:06,870
And everyone listening you've got damn 
well.

545
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,010
No it does not.
So up next we've got Ian,

546
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:13,920
the intern,
the wonderful beloved by all.

547
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,970
He has got a presentation.
Kanye has been all over the news.

548
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,830
People I've been waiting.
Yeah,

549
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,790
Connie's been up to a lot.
And you guys may not know this about Ian

550
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:24,890
to intern,
but um,

551
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,690
he is a huge Kanye fan.

552
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,713
He is a,
he's actually even written a screenplay 

553
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,940
about Kanye is life.
Yeah.

554
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,740
I didn't know that.
You didn't know that.

555
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,670
No,
he's,

556
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,370
he is.
I mean he's obsessed.

557
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:42,204
It's a little weird.
So he is calm with a presentation and 

558
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:47,844
I'm super excited.
I mean everything inputs together as 

559
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,740
gold after that,
that's coming up after the break.

560
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:53,574
Then we've got papa John Update.
We've got all kinds of fun stuff 

561
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:57,600
including this.
Check this out.

562
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,330
John operates on my favorite updates.
Oh God.

563
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:02,760
Every time it's amazing.
And this time is no exception.

564
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,073
A dream cruise on Australia was ruined 
by 1300 Indian men partying from a 

565
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:15,360
tobacco company that brought playboy 
bunnies with them and ruin the boat ride

566
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:17,430
for everybody.
We've got footage,

567
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,323
we got everything you need to enjoy that
story so we're going to throw it to a 

568
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,250
commercial break and when we come back 
in,

569
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,103
your boy is going to be here with all 
the Kanye updates that you could ever 

570
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:31,830
want and so much more.
Stay tuned.

571
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,713
23 and me is a DNA testing service that 
can offer insights into your ancestry 

572
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,660
health,
wellness and traits.

573
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,980
My dudes,
I love this thing man.

574
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,540
You spit in a cup.
Yes,

575
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:44,374
send it off.
Some dude in a office throws it in his 

576
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:50,470
mouth and then he tells you everything 
you need to know about you.

577
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,360
I'm just kidding.
I don't think that's how they do it,

578
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,403
but you do spit in a vial,
you send it off to a bunch of 

579
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:55,954
scientists,
they crunched the numbers and they tell 

580
00:29:57,101 --> 00:29:58,870
you all this interesting stuff about 
you,

581
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,060
like your weight,
your sleep quality,

582
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,130
caffeine intake,
sense of taste,

583
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,023
whether you are likely to be lactose 
intolerant and so much and if you're 

584
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,630
likely to die from Alzheimer's or not,
which is a really fun one,

585
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,990
but it's good.
It's good to know and it's easy to do.

586
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,810
Um,
the bitter taste report.

587
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:19,990
Here's some interesting ones.
Do you prefer sweet or salty foods?

588
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,570
DNA could play a role in determining 
your food preferences.

589
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,200
That's interesting.

590
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,240
Sleep report.
Are you a deep sleeper?

591
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,163
Are You a light sleeper?
Are you likely to move during your 

592
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:31,330
sleep?
It's all in that vial of spit folks.

593
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,110
Saturated fat weight report based on 
your genetics May,

594
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:37,090
are you likely to be a big fat,
fatty,

595
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:37,751
fat,
fat?

596
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:39,250
Or like Elan,
he's skinny.

597
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,270
We have different,
uh,

598
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,200
does imagines and frankly it's not,
it's not your fault.

599
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,910
You remember that scene from goodwill

602
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,940
It's not your fault.
I'm lactose intolerant.

603
00:30:54,941 --> 00:30:57,130
Hey,

604
00:30:57,131 --> 00:30:59,530
They're gonna tell you about what your 
background is from you.

605
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:00,700

00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,630
You're going to learn all about 
yourself.

611

615
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,510
That's what postmates gives you.
That's the power of postmates.

616
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,810
I love postmates.
I love postmates.

617
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,760
It's the best thing that's ever been 
invented.

618
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:40,594
Here's how it works.
You just download the APP 24 hours a 

619
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:44,880
day,
three 65 year post,

620

which will bring you whatever you want 
within that hour.

621
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,633
You can even see where your food is and 
track your driver to make sure there's 

622
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:55,240
no effin funny be business like a 
personal assistant.

623
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,560
It's basically,
yeah,

624
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,510
a freelance personal assistance.
That's right.

625
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:00,490
You'll have a very good analogy.
You forgot eggs.

626
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:03,610
You forgot milk.
No effin problem craving a tasty burger.

627
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,710
Check.
Looking for some beer,

628
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,740
some cigarettes.
You know what I mean?

629
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,630
That's just,
it's nice when you're like,

630
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:11,270
man,
I'm,

631
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,103
I'm drunk and I'm at home.
I want a frozen pizza and some 

632
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:17,320
cigarettes.
That's what postmates is all about.

633
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,960
Oh,
I want some for on this food APP,

634
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:21,700
but my favorite restaurant doesn't 
deliver.

635
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,520
Postmates does every time.
All right.

636
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,280
Postmates is your new longterm munchies 
booty call.

637
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,570
They wrote that,
not me.

638
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,380
I just want to make that clear,
but it's a good point.

639
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,233
That's a good analogy.
You do not get to fuck your driver 

640
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:35,470
though.
That is not part of the deal.

641
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,573
So for limited time,

and some people more than others.
Okay.

649
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,890
Here's what's the deal.
Sexual performance issues,

650
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,933
it's more common than you think.
Over 25% of new ed cases are guys under 

651
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:09,884
the age of 40 and 40% of men by age 40 
struggle with not being able to get 

652
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:14,294
their dick rock hard like they used to 
be able to get it and even the world's 

653
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:19,280
greatest actors can't fake one.
That's right.

654
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:21,380
Even Tom Cruise can't fake having an 
erection.

655
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,480
I don't know why Tom Cruise,
he's not the best actor in the role.

656
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:25,550
A Marlin,
who is the best actor in the world?

657
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:27,650
He can't fake interaction.
Why do you guys,

658
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,530
he doesn't need help.
Get an erection.

659
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:34,190
I got rocks around rock hard.
Why do guys turn a word selections or do

660
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:36,680
nothing when they can turn to medicine 
and science?

661
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,480
My dudes,
this is the real deal.

old guys in bath tubs.

674
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,084
Why are they in bath time?
It affects men's in their thirties and 

675
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:18,860
their forties doing whatever you do.
I don't,

I don't take a bath.
I don't know.

I haven't taken a bath as I was five.

678
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,170
Being your best means performing your 
best.

It's a wreck tile without the 
dysfunction.

Folks made hard.
Say stay hard.

Say hello to your foot.

We're here with and the intern who has 
prepared with us another of his classic 

691
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:07,904
powerpoint presentations.
Thank you so much him for taking the

time,
but that together for us.

693
00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:12,440
How are you?
I'm doing good.

694
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,280
I've been working on this a long,
long day.

695
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,540
It's your life at work.
It's the culmination of your life's work

696
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,610
emission of a full 24 hours for sure.
Are you are a Kanye mega fan,

697
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:26,690
is that correct to say?
Yeah,

698
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,410
I'd probably say top 100 top 100 fans in
the world.

699
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,800
I'd say so.
That's wow.

700
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,780
So if you know anyone disputes that you 
tried to try me.

701
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:38,040
So the only way you be a bigger fan,

702
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,873
it's kind of by stocking him and waiting
outside his house and attempting to 

703
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:43,230
murder and wearing his skin.
Yeah.

704
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,520
So you're,
you're just one step under us.

705
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,500
A psychopathic murderer.
Excellent.

706
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,980
Good.
Now what is it about sociopaths?

707
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,750
We shouldn't get any of that.
Yeah.

708
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:57,730
Now's not the time or place.
He lives at therapist spying on you,

709
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,620
but you gotta give me the side load.
Yeah.

710
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,430
Um,
now tell me,

711
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:04,330
what is it about Connie,
that intro?

712
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,011
Do you,
well,

713
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:05,844
let me see.
Are you fans of anyone else who has 

714
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,180
Kanye?
Like he's your guy.

715
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,180
There's a lot of people I like,
but he's definitely,

716
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,900
he's your guy.
And what is it about Kanye that,

717
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,793
that you love so much that he's probably
the only person in pop culture that I 

718
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,660
get close to sing like role model.
He's a role model.

719
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,150
What are the attributes that you look up
to of his,

720
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,220
like how his blame honesty that gets him
in a lot of trouble,

721
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:35,460
but he feels like one of the only 
authentic,

722
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,790
like everything he thinks,
even though,

723
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,310
you know,
some of it is stupid,

724
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,540
he doesn't hesitate to let you know all 
of his flaws or elders issues.

725
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,870
And that's more relatable to me than 
everyone else.

726
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,570
He's authentic.
You're like,

727
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,750
yeah,
definitely.

728
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,530
And we see all the faults and the cracks
and all of that,

729
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,120
and it's,
it's like,

730
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,830
you know,
everyone's like that,

731
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,740
but he's like one of the few brave 
enough to be like,

732
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:02,520
yeah,
this is,

733
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,180
this is how I am.
And I'm kind of,

734
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,540
you know,
and you're a fan of his music obviously.

735
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,561
Yeah,
no,

736
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:08,394
he's great.
He's your favorite musician as well as 

737
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,470
artists.
Yeah.

738
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,290
I love this.
Have you seen his sex tape?

739
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,620
Wait,
he never made any,

740
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,410
oh,
did you?

741
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,010
Have you seen a sex tape?
Yeah.

742
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:21,550
Yeah.
What do you think about it and had good,

743
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,340
good.
It's not that good.

744
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,700
And all these celebrity sex takes are so
underrated.

745
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:28,360
It's like,
do you think that she,

746
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:31,570
and they intentionally released that 
right eye?

747
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,750
It's like,
not quite sure,

748
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,770
but it's true that that sex tape was 
kind of what put her on the map.

749
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,870
Right.
It definitely helped before that.

750
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:40,704
And then she was really close with Paris
Hilton and was around in those circles 

751
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,144
and stuff.
I think I saw on porn hub that the Kim 

752
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,070
Kardashians sex tape has like over a 
hundred million views and crazy.

753
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:51,331
Yeah.
No,

754
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:53,520
it's like massive on there.
It's pretty wild.

755
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,530
Um,
okay.

756
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,850
You've seen it.
Yeah.

757
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:57,684
I mean,
okay.

758
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,430
Yeah.
That's good.

759
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,150
I don't know if I've seen it.
I mean,

760
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:01,590
you're not missing much.
It's just,

761
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,290
it's a lot of like Dude Pov,
right?

762
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,090
Yeah.
It's just,

763
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:06,924
it's bad angles.
You just can't really enjoy the show as 

764
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:11,730
they say.
How many times have you watched it?

765
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,640
More than often?
Just every once in a while.

766
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,840
No,
not even recently.

767
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:17,910
I like multiple times.
Well,

768
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:19,920
no,
I respect Kim and the fans.

769
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:22,170
You don't watch it anymore,
but before,

770
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,273
how many times have you seen it?
More than five times or less than five 

771
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:26,460
times less?

772
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,930
Be Honest.
Honestly,

773
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,860
I'd say less.
I would tell you the truth.

774
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,320
Like three,
three,

775
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,110
four,
four and a half?

776
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:35,981
Yeah.
Well,

777
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,080
obviously has,
I mean you have to be crazy to watch the

778
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:40,080
whole thing.
Um,

779
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,030
and are you a fan of Kim Kardashian as 
much as Anya?

780
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:48,180
Not as nowhere near,
but I've come to like her through.

781
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,100
Do you see what he finds him?
Her like the,

782
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,220
yeah.
What is fine?

783
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,020
I'm serious.
Well that's another,

784
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:04,090
both of these people are so hated,
like vitriolic,

785
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,480
like fury.
And I think it's,

786
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,340
it's a,
you know,

787
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,840
a little unnecessary.
She's like everything she just did,

788
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:16,360
getting that woman out of prison.
That was very cool.

789
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,550
And she's actively,
it's weird.

790
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:20,860
There's pictures of her.
Just she's going to the White House.

791
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:21,694
No,
kind of semi-regular hanging out and 

792
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:25,200
trying to,
she has a whole list.

793
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:26,960
It's trying to fucker.
Oh yeah.

794
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,100
All right.
Let's get started into the,

795
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,540
what is then,
what is this Kanye?

796
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,470
What verse?
The world.

797
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:36,160
What are we calling this?
A kanye decoded Kanye.

798
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,720
He coded.
Wow.

799
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,280
Yeah.
My hand.

800
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:40,630
Amen.
Go right in.

801
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,200
So,
jobs,

802
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,260
Ford,
Edison,

803
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,570
Disney.
I see where this is going.

804
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,720
And Stein Picasso.
How many of these,

805
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:00,350
how many please?
I'm,

806
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,280
I'm in the middle of something here.
Shakespeare,

807
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,970
uh,
Andy Warhol.

808
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,080
Warhol.
Thank you.

809
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,690
I forgot for a second.
As long as tweets,

810
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,780
a Dora the explorer launch Schwietz 
apparent on Vanilla pea.

811
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,670
Von [inaudible] was strong.
Start here again.

812
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,100
The Vinci,
you know,

813
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,620
uh,
Hughes.

814
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,740
Phelps.
Did you rehearse this?

815
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,610
Socrates?
I'm get,

816
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,330
I'm getting to a thing.
Tesla.

817
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,230
You know,
Michelangelo,

818
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,820
my God.
Hawking,

819
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,383
are you trolling me?
Is there a presentation or is it just 

820
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,160
thing they're getting their Beethoven 
Jackson Buddy.

821
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,613
The Elf.
Not,

822
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,850
not welfare old then health,
but he's just west.

823
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,150
Oh,
are you with me so far?

824
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,430
I think so.
What is it you're trying to say?

825
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,183
And great mind,
these are all people Kanye is compared 

826
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:06,724
himself to.

827
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,060
Wow.
Okay.

828
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:12,000
So you definitely,
you had a thing here.

829
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,151
Yeah,
there's,

830
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:15,070
there's reason behind the madness.
Hey,

831
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:17,380
so,
and I shouldn't have doubted,

832
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:19,230
you know that Elf,
what did you,

833
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,190
who was that?
A Disney.

834
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,050
Oh,
von Schwietz.

835
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,480
I need to compare itself to launch 
tweets.

836
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,760
He said,
cause if you've seen record Ralph.

837
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,690
Yes.
She like is it the,

838
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:33,560
she's the glitch.
Kanye says I'm the glacier glitch.

839
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:36,080
We're going to decode that right now.
And you know,

840
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:37,820
that is what we're trying to do for the 
Matrix.

841
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:40,820
Kanye d coated the enigma of political 
affiliation.

842
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,400
A lot of people are upset about,
you know,

843
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,330
this guy's recent activities.
Absolutely.

844
00:41:46,331 --> 00:41:47,420
Yeah.
Uh,

845
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:52,010
it kind of kicked off a few weeks ago.
He announced his new album,

846
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,113
Yon d uh,
he said it was coming out September 

847
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,050
29th.
Yani is Kanye and Gandhi.

848
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:05,900
That's not a bold claim.
And here's the album cover.

849
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,810
It's similar to his album from 2013.

850
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,240
Yeezus.
So this is the,

851
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,060
these making a play on word that he's 
some kind of savior.

852
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:16,070
But does he actually believed that 
because he is,

853
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,263
has manic states.
Does he believe he is uses probably in 

854
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:21,980
those states.
He's gets close.

855
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,350
Uh,
especially recently.

856
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:27,860
He's on this whole love thing I'm 
talking about,

857
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:32,910
but so he releases this September 29th 
and then I gave it a little spin there.

858
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,080
SNL announced that he would be the 
highest on the 29th or he'd,

859
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:41,210
he'd be the musical guest.
So everyone assumed,

860
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:41,901
okay,
he's going to come,

861
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:44,840
he's going to play some new songs.
The album will come out.

862
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,410
So first song,
I'm sure you saw this performance.

863
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,810
I love it.
Yeah.

864
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,300
It's catching a little pod.
Can My head song one?

865
00:42:56,301 --> 00:43:00,710
We're having fun.
We're having fun out here song too.

866
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,680
So cool.
So cool.

867
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,100
I think those are summaries of that 
experience.

868
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,100
Yeah.
That's my review.

869
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,440
Came out and played a song called we got
love.

870
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,750
Great.
Very cool song.

871
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:19,751
Three liberals can't control me.
Takes a turn,

872
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,310
hold on.
Takes a turn.

873
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:26,220
And people weren't quite happy about it.
Uh,

874
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,940
he launched into his speech at the end 
of,

875
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,780
he was playing ghost town and then NBC 
cut the Stream.

876
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,980
Wow.
They cut him off.

877
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,450
Yeah.
I haven't seen this.

878
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,400
And some,
some people are saying,

879
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:38,234
oh,
it was just because they ran out of 

880
00:43:38,511 --> 00:43:41,000
time,
but it was right before he launched into

881
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:43,670
his speech and someone recorded it who 
was backstage.

882
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,430
They cut it.
It never got aired.

883
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,130
Yeah.
So,

884
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,973
uh,
here's the recording from one of his 

885
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:54,200
main producers.
It was backstage

886
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:16,080
one trump thing.
Cath laughing in the background.

887
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:25,890
Superman Cape on this means you can't 
tell me what to do.

888
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,230
That's how we control.
That's how we're programmed.

889
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,530
If you want the world to move forward,
try love.

890
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,770
Thank y'all for giving me this platform.
I know.

891
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,220
I don't agree.
He's killing it though.

892
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:56,810
90% of news are liberal.
No,

893
00:44:56,811 --> 00:44:58,910
that can't be true.
90%.

894
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,140
And they do your writers,
rappers,

895
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,243
musicians.
So it's easy to make it seem like it's 

896
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:07,670
so,
so,

897
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:12,671
so one sided and um,
they're just stuck up there.

898
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,150
Them hold them hostage a little bit.
I've talked to this country also.

899
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:24,350
They're very anti trump,
so he's Kinda bitching them out.

900
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,223
Yeah.

901
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:31,960
Got

902
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,840
It.
You know what?

903
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,630
I thought that was a beautiful,
authentic tender moment.

904
00:45:35,631 --> 00:45:37,610
And to real goddamn shame they caught 
them off.

905
00:45:37,611 --> 00:45:38,444
Like that gives you a context to why 
he's wearing this hat kind of feel like 

906
00:45:42,681 --> 00:45:45,290
they should have kept it.
It's not really,

907
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,590
I mean it is obviously very provocative,
but I understand,

908
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,513
I appreciate the point he's trying to 
make of like stepping across the aisle 

909
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,103
and seeing people as people and not 
because it's so easy from the left or 

910
00:45:58,161 --> 00:46:00,050
right to just demonize and that's what 
they do.

911
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:02,420
Cause like I wish a while a lot of left 
wing,

912
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:03,893
uh,
media like Jimmy Kimmel and the Steven 

913
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,790
Colbert is and all these guys and 
they're just,

914
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:09,740
they talk about,
and Bill Maher,

915
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,260
it talked about the other side.
Like they're just monsters.

916
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,520
You know,
Bill Murray,

917
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:14,354
who was the only one that actually we'll
have a conversation without her side 

918
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:17,690
only.

919
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:21,470
But like G-man,
chemo treats them like they're monsters.

920
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,503
Yeah.
So I appreciate the sentiment and there 

921
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:27,290
was another part,
I don't know where it went by,

922
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:28,124
where he said like,
you guys kind of go at trump like a 

923
00:46:31,281 --> 00:46:35,510
little too hard and it's nonstop,
but it doesn't really help anything.

924
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,100
Yeah.
So he told them as well,

925
00:46:37,101 --> 00:46:40,130
like I love how he's like thank you for 
a platform.

926
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:40,671
And they're like,
dude,

927
00:46:40,671 --> 00:46:43,610
we pulled the plug two minutes.
They're like,

928
00:46:43,611 --> 00:46:45,140
we gotta get this guy out of here.
Man.

929
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:45,974
I feel bad.
I,

930
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,780
well,
I'm glad that somebody recorded it.

931
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,930
Yeah.
How have people reacted to that clip?

932
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,030
Not Gray.
Not Gray.

933
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,530
No.
Um,

934
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,020
there was another one that everyone saw 
first.

935
00:46:57,021 --> 00:47:00,620
Chris Rock was in the audience and he 
was filming it and he's just laughing.

936
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,260
Chris Rock filmed it.
What a weird twist.

937
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:06,620
Yeah.
I'm on his instagram story and you could

938
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:09,590
hear him chuckling and being like,
oh my God.

939
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,550
Right.
Well what do you expect this Kanye West.

940
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:14,503
Yeah.
You know,

941
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:15,403
that's,
it's weird that he would have that risk 

942
00:47:16,591 --> 00:47:18,800
surprised.
But also I find it,

943
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:19,663
I find that a little bit rude and 
condescending to laugh at a guy who's 

944
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,910
trying to express himself authentically.
It's like listen to the guy,

945
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:26,744
you know what I'm saying?
That's kind of the point that he's 

946
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:29,384
making cause just because he's wearing 
that hat is immediately labeled like a 

947
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:38,650
joke and it's like why can't anyone 
where like 50% of the country apparently

948
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,200
supports Donald Trump and rocks that 
hat.

949
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,890
So why is it like that when you wear 
that hat it's like wearing a swastika or

950
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:46,390
some shit.
It's like that's the

951
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,790
neighbors.
Yeah,

952
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:50,983
the hat is,
it's getting such like a visceral 

953
00:47:52,581 --> 00:47:55,550
immediate response from people and then 
they don't want to dig deeper.

954
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,630
But again,
I'm sure there's,

955
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,793
I feel like I'm maybe supporting that 
too much because then there's a lot of 

956
00:48:01,071 --> 00:48:02,190
people like,
well he said,

957
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,373
I'm going to say one way or the other.
I appreciate the act of trying to 

958
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:09,320
reconcile these very fractured cup 
country that we live in.

959
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,100
I mean I had that immediate reaction 
when I saw him with the hat on the show.

960
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:13,670
I was like,
Ugh,

961
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:16,140
why are,
yeah my wearing that.

962
00:48:16,141 --> 00:48:18,320
And like that was my first reaction.
But it's all just like,

963
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,690
Oh Paul,
we're all so sick of politics too.

964
00:48:20,691 --> 00:48:21,524
It's like,
I just fucking make music and entertain 

965
00:48:23,261 --> 00:48:23,570
us.

966
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,100
Because there's also people that are 
like,

967
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:25,963
oh,
well he's only doing that because he 

968
00:48:26,961 --> 00:48:28,340
doesn't really care.
He's just,

969
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,170
he's in the headlines.
Again,

970
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:31,783
I don't believe that because he kept 
doing after his last album came out a 

971
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:38,600
lot of shit for it.
So the day after that,

972
00:48:38,601 --> 00:48:41,540
then he posts his photo.
That's the funny thing.

973
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,423
I have instagram and the caption.
This represents good and America 

974
00:48:45,861 --> 00:48:46,694
becoming whole again.
We will no longer outsource to other 

975
00:48:48,081 --> 00:48:48,914
countries.
We build factories here in America and 

976
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:51,104
create jobs.
It will provide jobs for all who are 

977
00:48:52,521 --> 00:48:56,360
free from prisons as we abolished the 
13th amendment message sent with love.

978
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,740
I'm not sure the trumps anything about 
bringing people from prison.

979
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,383
Yeah,
he's,

980
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,820
and then this kind of in some trouble 
because yeah,

981
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:05,690
this,
this is,

982
00:49:05,691 --> 00:49:09,260
this is less about,
this is more political.

983
00:49:09,261 --> 00:49:11,630
This is like I'm a,
I support Donald Trump.

984
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:14,390
Yeah.
And then the,

985
00:49:14,391 --> 00:49:17,210
he said abolished the 13th amendment,
which is the one that,

986
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,790
yeah,
the whole sentence slavery.

987
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:22,430
But then there's like a section of that 
that says,

988
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,850
except for p praise resins.
And he later said,

989
00:49:25,851 --> 00:49:27,050
I meant the word amended.

990
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:27,970
It's like,
Bro,

991
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,340
you got to clarify that.
Like,

992
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,503
come on.
You got to know that doesn't come off 

993
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:35,530
good with them.
With a maggot hat.

994
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,150
Yeah.
And I think he's still trying to be like

995
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:41,980
this.
I'm reaching across.

996
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:43,663
A lot of people have pointed out that 
like the Migraine hat has a label that 

997
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:48,760
says made in China.
And so it's like,

998
00:49:48,761 --> 00:49:51,170
if you want to start the movement,
well,

999
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,053
you know,
there's this great clip of when Donald 

1000
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:57,940
was running for the Republican nominee,
he went on Jimmy Kimmel.

1001
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,250
It was so great.
And camel had a bunch of trump ties with

1002
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:04,780
the label made in China,

1003
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:07,183
you know?
Yeah.

1004
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:11,010
So then the response to this,
here's a couple reacts reactions.

1005
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:12,590
Evans,
Captain America,

1006
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,630
Captain America.
I'm with a lot of life.

1007
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,020
He jumped in 600,000
lights.

1008
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,450
Yeah.
So,

1009
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,030
uh,
he's response,

1010
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,864
there's nothing more maddening than 
debating someone who doesn't know 

1011
00:50:22,701 --> 00:50:23,534
history.
It doesn't read books and frames or 

1012
00:50:25,311 --> 00:50:28,880
Myopia is virtue.
The level of conjecture I've encountered

1013
00:50:28,881 --> 00:50:32,780
lately isn't just frustrating.
It's retrogressive unprecedented.

1014
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:33,980
An absolutely terrifying

1015
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,500
that got 600,000
likes.

1016
00:50:35,501 --> 00:50:39,880
I don't think people even understood 
like he got away too hard to sound smart

1017
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:40,320
there.

1018
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,370
Yeah,
he went all in.

1019
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,900
He,
he got the webster's out.

1020
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,203
He fought.
That was straight up cause sponsored by 

1021
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,120
thesaurus.com.
Um,

1022
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,000
yeah,
curiously 600,000

1023
00:50:52,001 --> 00:50:54,150
people slammed that.
I mean that's just such,

1024
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,083
I mean I,

1025
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,403
yeah.
And then Lana Delray commented this one 

1026
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:04,841
had like right under his photo.
This one had like 30,000

1027
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,863
by the way,
I want to say it once again for the 

1028
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:08,990
record,
not,

1029
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,153
I'm not supporting in favor of Donald 
Trump and in fact I want to say he 

1030
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:15,350
definitely made it to political at that 
point.

1031
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,540
Yeah.
I didn't like that one.

1032
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:18,920
He cause then again,
it's like,

1033
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:19,880
oh,
we're talking about bringing,

1034
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,050
it's like,
Eh,

1035
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,453
I like,
I liked the gesture of healing the 

1036
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:25,514
divide,
but then he made a political and using 

1037
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:29,114
these talking points and I so I 
understand the backlash at that point 

1038
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:36,330
should have kept it pure about just 
you've got to stick to walk point.

1039
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,930
Yeah.
I like it where he's like,

1040
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:44,590
don't scape goat me just because I liked
this guy along 50% of the America,

1041
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:51,500
but now you got,
Chris Evans is going@thesource.com

1042
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:53,480
and writing a dissertation,
a thesis,

1043
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:55,090
a doctoral,
uh,

1044
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,830
on it.
Dr America.

1045
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:59,420
Okay.
I cannot believe 600,000

1046
00:51:59,421 --> 00:52:01,550
people pretended to understand what he 
just dropped.

1047
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,640
I can or you can't understand.
I can believe that.

1048
00:52:05,641 --> 00:52:06,474
That there's nothing more maddening than
debating someone who doesn't know 

1049
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:10,394
history,
doesn't read books and frames their 

1050
00:52:11,931 --> 00:52:16,400
Myopia as virtue.
What the level,

1051
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,800
unapologetic conjecture.
What the fuck?

1052
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,120
Just say what you mean like you do.
Why are you writing a essay on twitter?

1053
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:28,310
The level of unapologetic conjecture of 
accountability isn't just frustrating.

1054
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,510
It's retrogressive unprecedented and 
Apps Shit,

1055
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,300
dude.
I said,

1056
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,070
when you're gonna to like criticize it 
Kanya for not being educated,

1057
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:40,370
then you come up with the,
I dare you to,

1058
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:41,204
what about the dictionary and deep 
belled this tweet such a pompous like 

1059
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:47,180
just fucking say what you want to say,
dude.

1060
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,290
You don't like what the guy says.
You think he's on the educated and uh,

1061
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,813
you know,

1062
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,710
yeah,
he definitely went a little overboard.

1063
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,573
And then Lana del Rey,
trump becoming our president was a loss 

1064
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:01,184
for the country,
but you were support of him is a loss 

1065
00:53:02,361 --> 00:53:04,340
for the culture.
Uh,

1066
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:06,920
I can only assume you were late to his 
personality on some level.

1067
00:53:06,921 --> 00:53:10,190
Delusions of grandeur,
extreme issues with narcissism.

1068
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,293
None of which would be a talking point 
if we weren't speaking about the man 

1069
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:14,024
leading our country.
If you think it's all right to support 

1070
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:16,994
someone who believes it's okay to grab a
woman by the pussy just because he's 

1071
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,810
famous,
then you need an intervention.

1072
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:21,644
As much as he does something,
so many narcissists we'll never get 

1073
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:26,160
because there just isn't help for the 
issue.

1074
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,890
Message sent with concern that we'll 
never be addressed.

1075
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,180
Hmm.
So that's real beef.

1076
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:34,050
That's beef.
She performed at his wedding.

1077
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,110
Well,
oh,

1078
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,140
so tell me,
how do you feel about,

1079
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:42,040
because about what Kanye said as a fan 
and a student of his,

1080
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,813
I think that,
I think that he's going about it the 

1081
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,610
completely wrong way.
Right.

1082
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:54,620
And I see,
I see what he's trying to do and I'm not

1083
00:53:54,621 --> 00:53:55,880
going to get,
like,

1084
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,043
I think people aren't shocked because I 
was looking up like what celebrities 

1085
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,720
actually endorsed trump.
And it's a real row of character,

1086
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,720
not the,
not the best.

1087
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:07,970
Yeah.

1088
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,573
Like far and away the most relevant 
entertainer to everyone was the other 

1089
00:54:14,471 --> 00:54:16,350
one roach.
Neat loaf and shit like that.

1090
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,240
It's like meatloaf.
The first one was Roseanne.

1091
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,670
That was the first one that popped up.
Oh,

1092
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:22,683
sorry.
One Sec.

1093
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:29,280
Yeah.
And like I'm whole Cogan you know,

1094
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,183
so yeah,
I think people can't believe that 

1095
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:33,903
because no one else has even getting 
close to that conversation who was 

1096
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:38,883
popular and so,
and then the last one was from 

1097
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,550
questlove.
He said,

1098
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:45,580
you know,
we aren't even typing his name.

1099
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,470
I find it strange.
She's and trending get,

1100
00:54:47,471 --> 00:54:50,800
we're all typing the same thing for all 
that he's canceled talk.

1101
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:52,900
There was an ounce of hope in our souls 
tonight,

1102
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,820
but all we got was,
well,

1103
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:58,000
I'm kind of sad man,
that was about the snl performance.

1104
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:03,580
So all three of those guys jumped in and
then snoop,

1105
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,430
snoop,
snoop went in for the kill.

1106
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,520
This guy named Dj Pooh,
uh,

1107
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,970
re posted the photo and said,
Magda music ain't getting attention.

1108
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,420
So he's saying he's kind of Promo.
Sure.

1109
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,270
And then snoop and the comments make 
your music again.

1110
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,050
Bleep and word.
Yeah,

1111
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,090
yeah,
yeah.

1112
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:28,510
With an a at the end.
And then he called him uncle Tom.

1113
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,290
No,
uncle Tom.

1114
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:32,190
Um,
for those of you who don't know,

1115
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,150
cause he didn't know what that is.
There was a book,

1116
00:55:35,151 --> 00:55:36,410
I don't remember what it was called,
right,

1117
00:55:36,411 --> 00:55:38,900
but a fictional character.
It was called a uncle Tom's cabin.

1118
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,070
Oh yeah.
Uncle Tom's cabin.

1119
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:45,170
A black man that owned slaves.
So he's betraying his own kind,

1120
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,750
in other words.
Yeah.

1121
00:55:47,751 --> 00:55:48,880
So he,
he said that

1122
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,330
and he was a earlier posts from him.
What the fuck?

1123
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,760
This was from one connie.
First put the hat on,

1124
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,720
he said the new Kanye,
well all white now way to go,

1125
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:00,960
dude edited him,
you know,

1126
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:07,320
so he used to be mad at Connie for 
awhile after this one on the left.

1127
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:08,853
Then Connie went out and wore a picture 
of snoop dogg on his shirt and then 

1128
00:56:13,331 --> 00:56:16,960
immediately snoop dogg posted it and 
said forgiveness is everything.

1129
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,020
So he won him over.

1130
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,870
He's easy.
And then like,

1131
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,830
like,
yeah.

1132
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,280
Of,

1133
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,550
and then I look how good was like you 
uncle Tom,

1134
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,650
which is kind of like the worst thing 
you could say to it.

1135
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:30,960
Another block.
I mean that's,

1136
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:32,740
that sounds a lot of hay.
Right.

1137
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:36,970
And then he just wears the shirt while 
still having them.

1138
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,520
Yeah.
But I,

1139
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,790
but again,
it's great.

1140
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:40,840
That's what he's,
you know,

1141
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:41,674
he's trying to do.
But I think Kanye beautifully disarmed 

1142
00:56:43,881 --> 00:56:45,730
that situation.
Yeah.

1143
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,410
And it worked.
Yeah.

1144
00:56:47,411 --> 00:56:49,630
It worked.
But I was like,

1145
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,140
so who's forgiving who in that scenario?
You know what I mean?

1146
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,710
Snoop,
I guess didn't,

1147
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,050
was forgiving Kanye because he wore the 
acknowledged him,

1148
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,880
cause that's,
you know,

1149
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,640
I'm going to have to use that.
Who am I wrong?

1150
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,290
I got to start wearing this shirt.
It's the move.

1151
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,820
That's the move for sure.
Yeah.

1152
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,660
And then trump tweeted after the s and l
performance,

1153
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,500
like many,
of course you have a trump.

1154
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,870
You had one last week.
The Tra like,

1155
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:17,704
man,
no,

1156
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:18,703
I'm not like,
I can do my best as Stephen Colbert 

1157
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,630
doing trump.
Yeah.

1158
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,730
That's,
nobody wants that.

1159
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,160
Like many,
I don't watch Saturday night live.

1160
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:28,870
You have a trump?
No,

1161
00:57:28,871 --> 00:57:30,640
not a good one.
Like man.

1162
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:31,860
I mean it's all,
yeah,

1163
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:33,040
it's just this.
It's okay.

1164
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:33,700
Good.
Yeah,

1165
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,690
we get it.
Let's go ahead.

1166
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,580
Like many,
I don't watch Saturday night live,

1167
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:37,960
even though I passed,
hosted it.

1168
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:40,450
No longer funny.
No talent or charm.

1169
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:41,843
It is just a political ad for the dems 
word is that Kanye west who put on a 

1170
00:57:45,321 --> 00:57:48,820
mega ha after the show,
despite being told no was great.

1171
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,030
He's leading the charge.
Very cool.

1172
00:57:52,031 --> 00:57:55,720
Kanye and very cool.
Uh,

1173
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,380
so everyone's kind of going,
but why,

1174
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,120
why is he doing this?
Why is he,

1175
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,730
you know,
taking his legacy like this?

1176
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,100
Did you make this fun?

1177
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:06,900
No.
No,

1178
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,890
I can't.
It's a good,

1179
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,980
good.
Uh,

1180
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:11,823
so you got to go back to 2013.
This isn't the first time he's done 

1181
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:19,270
this.
A lot of people kind of forgot.

1182
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,063
He put out his album yeezus and June of 
2013 and then he put out all of the 

1183
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:30,961
merge and all of the merge was covered 
in the confederate flag.

1184
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:32,980
Wow.
That's pretty racy.

1185
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,020
Yeah.
Literally.

1186
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,610
And so that was a huge thing at the 
time.

1187
00:58:39,611 --> 00:58:44,611
Then I didn't see that everything we 
were falling client so close.

1188
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:46,270
They look like a midget.
Oh,

1189
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,190
kind of like until we met.
Yeah.

1190
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:50,620
I'm not supposed to be a midget and I 
guess I ain't either.

1191
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,680
Yeah.
So a bunch of the merge had,

1192
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:54,543
a lot of people were upset and here's a 
clip of him in 2013 explaining why he 

1193
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:02,050
wore,
why he wore the confederate flag,

1194
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:02,884
merge

1195
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,460
the tour,
merge she I Red Eye,

1196
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:07,380
which I thought was kind of like the 
people.

1197
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:09,360
I thought people just want to find 
something to get.

1198
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:09,980
Yeah.
You know,

1199
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,580
I just want to get all riled up about 
something.

1200
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,713
But it was about the tour merchant,
the confederate flags in the skeleton 

1201
00:59:14,761 --> 00:59:16,590
imagery and things like that.
I mean,

1202
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,420
do you think people are overreacting 
with this?

1203
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,590
React how you want?
And I got said it's making react,

1204
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:22,310
I guess.
Right?

1205
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,900
Energy.
You got as good energy.

1206
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,290
You know,
the confederate flag represented slavery

1207
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,190
in a way.
The way my mom's shot,

1208
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,780
that's about abstract take on what I 
know about it.

1209
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:34,880
Right.
So I made the song new slaves,

1210
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,580
so I took the confederate flag and made 
it my flat.

1211
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,380
It's my flag now.
Now just go and do.

1212
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:40,663
I like that.

1213
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:43,470
Yeah.
That's great.

1214
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,330
That's a great,
that's beautiful.

1215
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,164
I love that.
And then just this was the day before 

1216
00:59:48,691 --> 00:59:52,170
the snl performance,
or he was explaining the maggot hat.

1217
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:56,700
I redesigned it.
I've been changed the Brim,

1218
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:58,913
change the shape right here,
and I'll put positive energy into the 

1219
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:03,064
hat.

1220
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,320
That's what he said about it there.
Yeah.

1221
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,220
But he fucked it up when he started 
talking about political point.

1222
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:08,623
Yeah,
that's definitely where it's getting 

1223
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:11,130
fucked that up.
Yeah.

1224
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:16,420
I think he started with this idea and 
then a bunch of sort of a right.

1225
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,960
You know,
I'm right leaning.

1226
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:23,330
People in,
in media started reaching out to him and

1227
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:27,350
he started taking meetings with them and
I think then they got in his brain,

1228
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,960
he got some,
yeah,

1229
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,320
he got some talking points from them and
you know,

1230
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,830
see,
there you go.

1231
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:35,420
He's becoming what he hates.
Kind of.

1232
01:00:35,421 --> 01:00:39,410
Isn't it true?
I think that he really,

1233
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,410
I don't think there's any maliciousness.
No,

1234
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:43,730
I know,
but he'd be coming,

1235
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,850
but he's almost upon to the,
uh,

1236
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,260
well,
whatever,

1237
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:49,910
what the fuck do I know?
It's kind of like,

1238
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:50,744
you know,
pulling whispering in his ear and he's 

1239
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:52,874
coming out.

1240
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,150
Yeah.
Talking about the,

1241
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,240
you know,
bringing jobs back or whatever.

1242
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,030
Not that that's a bad thing,
but it is a talking point.

1243
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,790
Yeah.
And then,

1244
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,730
let's see,
so that was from that thing.

1245
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,620
He's wearing a make America great again 
hat.

1246
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:12,080
And then his sweater is Colin 
Kaepernick.

1247
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:13,613
Um,
he's keeps trying to do this duality 

1248
01:01:16,101 --> 01:01:16,934
thing.
These are all the people he follows on 

1249
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:21,320
twitter.
It's like Bernie Sanders trump.

1250
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:24,380
Uh,
and then he,

1251
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:26,690
he followed those two at the same exact 
time.

1252
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:27,763
Bernie and trump.
And then he followed Candice Owens who 

1253
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:33,680
is a Republican.
I'm a media personality.

1254
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:37,780
And Emma Gonzales who was kind of,
she was leading the Antigua.

1255
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:38,903
Yeah.
He followed them at the exact same time 

1256
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:43,060
to at exact same time.
Yeah.

1257
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,650
It was like a media.
So he's trying to create a statement.

1258
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:50,570
Only eight followers.
Yeah.

1259
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:53,150
It's exclusive club.
Interesting.

1260
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,190
Someday get in that club.

1261
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:01,130
Who is your opposite match?
Yeah.

1262
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,013
I don't know.
I don't want to have to find a nemesis 

1263
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,760
free.
Uh,

1264
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,833
here's a tweet.
I haven't done enough research on 

1265
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:10,934
conservatives to call myself or be 
called one on just refusing to be 

1266
01:02:13,071 --> 01:02:15,230
enslaved by monolithic thought.
And all right.

1267
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,480
Um,
here's a,

1268
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:19,350
it's more of just him saying,
you know,

1269
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,750
the hat,
it's not about policies.

1270
01:02:21,751 --> 01:02:22,584
I'm not a politician like that.
It represents overcoming fear and doing 

1271
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:26,370
what you felt.
No matter what anyone said,

1272
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:28,980
you can't bully me.
Liberals can't bully me.

1273
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:31,350
News can't bully me.
The hip hop community can't believe me.

1274
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,690
Uh,
and here's Kim's saying,

1275
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:34,524
you know,
we would talk about policies and he 

1276
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:38,790
doesn't agree with the policies.
He likes his personality and how he made

1277
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:42,640
it to be president when everyone really 
underestimated him essentially.

1278
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:44,310
All right.
And then the next,

1279
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,360
the dragon energy.

1280
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:48,660
Yeah.
And here's one of his good friends after

1281
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:50,040
the,
after the performance,

1282
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:52,650
he has never said he agrees with trump's
policies.

1283
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:55,410
Just the fact that no one would have 
thought trump would be president,

1284
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:57,720
meaning he did the emba.
Unbelievable.

1285
01:02:57,721 --> 01:02:58,554
And that's the connection.
Only him wearing the hat is his choice 

1286
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:02,160
and he feels he's stripping the power of
hate.

1287
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,480
That people give that hat by wearing it 
and wants to love all no matter how they

1288
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:09,930
speak of him or whatever we don't agree 
with because that's how God works.

1289
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:10,764
God loves all.
If he was trying to strip the power of 

1290
01:03:14,361 --> 01:03:16,400
hate that people give it by wearing it,
he would.

1291
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:19,640
He's never said that.
No,

1292
01:03:19,641 --> 01:03:22,220
not well,
he said he put like positive energy into

1293
01:03:22,221 --> 01:03:25,340
the hat,
but what does that,

1294
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,280
oh,
it means it's like diamond water.

1295
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:31,410
They run it through and he liked it when
asked about the core energy.

1296
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,040
And he's right.
He washed it and dining and water.

1297
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,900
I'm going to ask you about the 
confederate flag.

1298
01:03:35,901 --> 01:03:38,390
He gave it very straightforward 
explanation.

1299
01:03:38,391 --> 01:03:41,900
He said this is represents slavery and 
now it's mine.

1300
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,220
Yeah.
Okay.

1301
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,980
Well yeah.
Okay.

1302
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:47,150
God bless.
God loves all.

1303
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,133
Uh,
and then here's a quick clip he was 

1304
01:03:49,851 --> 01:03:54,650
asked about if you liked why he is 
showing support for trump.

1305
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:55,933
Oh wait,
where'd it go?

1306
01:03:58,610 --> 01:03:59,443
There we go.

1307
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:01,710
So maybe that's what you liked the idea?
Yeah.

1308
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,490
Not necessarily.
I do.

1309
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,390
Donald Trump with the idea of an outside
of infiltrating.

1310
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,280
Yeah,
I liked it.

1311
01:04:09,281 --> 01:04:10,114
It showed you that anything is possible 
shows you that it doesn't even like 

1312
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,330
Virgil,
uh,

1313
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:20,110
working at Louis Vuitton,
trump being in office,

1314
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:23,050
it's a time for the unconventional.
I'm,

1315
01:04:23,051 --> 01:04:25,210
I'm very,
I'm not a traditional thinker.

1316
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,380
I'm a non conformist,
you know?

1317
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,090
So that relates to the nonconformists.
Pardon me now,

1318
01:04:31,091 --> 01:04:32,950
you know,
but I'm also,

1319
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:34,750
I'm a producer.
I like to segue things.

1320
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:36,400
I'd like to take Otis,
chop it up,

1321
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,170
do it like this.
So,

1322
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,310
so what's the gay version?
And the gay version of b,

1323
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,930
the trump campaign and maybe to Bernie 
Sanders principles.

1324
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:48,160
That would be my mics and stuff.
But I think both had,

1325
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:49,660
you know,
uh,

1326
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,160
you know,
I need it.

1327
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,650
So that's,
there you go.

1328
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:59,710
So I don't know where he is with his 
thoughts on politics.

1329
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:00,920
Okay,
bye.

1330
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:04,330
Are you though?
So really the question was like,

1331
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,283
you know,
can you turn this into something 

1332
01:05:07,931 --> 01:05:08,840
positive?
Sure.

1333
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:12,760
I don't personally,
I don't think so.

1334
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,480
And you liked them to charged like the 
yeah,

1335
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:17,733
you can't in a way like it's hard to 
just say I just like trump because he 

1336
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:22,534
made it against all odds without 
acknowledging everything that he stands 

1337
01:05:26,861 --> 01:05:27,694
for.

1338
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,463
Well,
I also recall him saying that he has he 

1339
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:33,480
redesigned the hat?
Yeah,

1340
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,840
he has a yeezy version of the make 
America great again hat that he wears.

1341
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,540
And I think that's fantastic that he 
made his own hat

1342
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,520
there.
Yeah,

1343
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,580
he changed the Brim,
changed the thing.

1344
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,070
Yeah.
It doesn't look better.

1345
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:46,060
I have to say.
It looks,

1346
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:48,910
he looks a little goofy when he,
the hat fit.

1347
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:51,100
Like,
if you recall the picture on Instagram,

1348
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,060
that's like a total goof angle while at 
any rate,

1349
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:56,230
Kanye,
he's out there,

1350
01:05:56,231 --> 01:05:57,940
he's doing his thing,
he's authentic.

1351
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,090
And you as a fan,
you love him.

1352
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,130
You against all odds forever.
So what,

1353
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:06,250
what if you could say anything to Konya 
right now,

1354
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:07,780
what would you tell him?
Kanya is right here.

1355
01:06:07,781 --> 01:06:08,614
What do you say?

1356
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:14,960
I'd probably say,
well first I think that um,

1357
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,310
I appreciate what he's trying to do.
Yes.

1358
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,060
But it's like,
it's,

1359
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:20,893
it's like a sisyphus task.
He's like rolling a boulder to Chris 

1360
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,340
Evans.
Yeah,

1361
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:28,280
the source out.
Um,

1362
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:31,160
it's like an,
I saw some people going well,

1363
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:31,551
like,
oh,

1364
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,384
like the swastika used to be a symbol of
peace and then they changed it to make 

1365
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:37,150
it a different thing.
But it's not,

1366
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,550
once that happens,
you can't bring it back.

1367
01:06:40,551 --> 01:06:43,550
You can't take the Hitler mustache.
I said it's like,

1368
01:06:43,551 --> 01:06:46,250
it's easier to,
to poison the,

1369
01:06:46,251 --> 01:06:51,251
well then to like purify the water.
So that's my thinking and trust.

1370
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:58,640
If he wants to use the hat,
I think he has to design,

1371
01:06:58,700 --> 01:06:59,533
redesign it a little further and stay 
out of the political talking points he 

1372
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:06,600
was saying is trying to remix.
Yeah.

1373
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,590
This ID as Buddy Dan change that had 
enough.

1374
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,280
My pitch.
I've got a pitch.

1375
01:07:13,281 --> 01:07:16,730
This isn't the redesign one,
but you've got,

1376
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:17,963
you know the Democrats typically blue 
publicans or read the trump has is very 

1377
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:27,080
red,
blue and red combined purple.

1378
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:30,350
There it is.
Purple Make America great again.

1379
01:07:30,351 --> 01:07:32,170
That's a brilliant idea.
Yes.

1380
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:32,270
You

1381
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:35,510
change it to purple being or that good 
ideas.

1382
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:36,803
Just that plain hat.
What's the goal with make America great 

1383
01:07:38,751 --> 01:07:39,440
again?
Right.

1384
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,020
Well then you change the slogan as well.
I looked it up.

1385
01:07:42,021 --> 01:07:45,200
I went to the meanings of colors and I 
was ah,

1386
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:46,641
I,
that's,

1387
01:07:46,641 --> 01:07:48,110
I was thinking,
I was like,

1388
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:49,760
what the hell?
Okay.

1389
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:50,863
Violet,
the color of spirituality to energy of 

1390
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:53,444
red with the calm.
Who defines who decides what color 

1391
01:07:55,581 --> 01:07:56,414
means?
A lot of these are marketing companies 

1392
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,980
as color plays very heavily.
Oh,

1393
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:01,390
okay.
This is like got it.

1394
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:02,283
A,
a color that inspires reflection and 

1395
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:06,140
self awareness.
It just the color of the sensitive,

1396
01:08:06,141 --> 01:08:08,390
compassionate,
intuitive soul.

1397
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:10,483
Violet has long been associated with 
royalty and characteristics of quality 

1398
01:08:13,851 --> 01:08:15,160
and luxury.
Mom,

1399
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:20,260
if you go back to his album,
cover the sticker on it was violent.

1400
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:22,670
Yes.
You think he's onto this already?

1401
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,070
No,
but I'm trying to leave Kanye.

1402
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,113
Well I think you've got to keep the,
make America great again cause then you 

1403
01:08:29,991 --> 01:08:34,430
have both colors the same meaning if you
go away from the phrase,

1404
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,100
it becomes something to different.
Combine them.

1405
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:42,490
Kanye who is listening for sure 
obviously listened to end.

1406
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:45,830
He's got great advice I think.
Or the slogan.

1407
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:48,680
I think you could slight,
I mean it could go both ways,

1408
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:50,840
but I think the color would be a good 
change.

1409
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,290
Maybe make America great cause it was 
not,

1410
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:55,124
again,
not everyone w it wasn't great for all 

1411
01:08:57,711 --> 01:08:59,320
people at any point.
Yeah.

1412
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,280
I'm Connie.
He has this whole thing.

1413
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:04,220
He's always talking about,
oh we teach history class.

1414
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,380
Why don't we teach future class,
right.

1415
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:07,670
That's his whole thing.
So look,

1416
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,620
look forward.
Let's make it great.

1417
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:10,483
Make America Great.
Stop looking bad and not rely am and 

1418
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:13,094
that's kind of,
yeah.

1419
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:15,260
Yeah.
If I'm maybe both,

1420
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:18,650
I said this maybe took a little from 
him.

1421
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:20,960
Make America unified.
Yeah.

1422
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,470
Combination.
Okay.

1423
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,320
Or make America love.
Okay.

1424
01:09:24,321 --> 01:09:25,460
That's a little corny.
And,

1425
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,093
and can mayberry well,
I wanted to please all the people out 

1426
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:31,454
there and I like the upgrades without,
it just took a little the about he 

1427
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,570
closes his dream.
Make America Great.

1428
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:39,950
I do like that one.
Okay,

1429
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,510
thanks.
So change the color,

1430
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,520
change the change of the Brim,
all that.

1431
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:45,350
Everybody tweaked the Connie,
let them know.

1432
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,490
I think we got it.
Yes.

1433
01:09:46,491 --> 01:09:48,050
Here.
If he did that then maybe.

1434
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,213
Maybe.
And do you think that if Kanye adopted 

1435
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:52,274
your idea from the show,
would they give you back membership 

1436
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,840
tier,
the Kanye form that you were banned from

1437
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,130
dance?
You already get it back.

1438
01:09:58,580 --> 01:09:59,391
Well,
no,

1439
01:09:59,391 --> 01:10:02,390
I don't think he did.
Every band I'm back,

1440
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:04,790
but they don't know I'm,
I'm there.

1441
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:05,780
Oh,
you have a new account.

1442
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,760
But they,
they couldn't know who's here and there.

1443
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:09,900
They're onto me.
Huh?

1444
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:11,930
I,
I saw a weird,

1445
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:14,840
gave me rolling.
Someone commented the other day and they

1446
01:10:14,841 --> 01:10:15,740
were like,
you,

1447
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:16,663
the way you type makes it seem like 
you've been here a lot longer than your 

1448
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,380
registration date.
They all know each other,

1449
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:22,250
Huh?
Yeah.

1450
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,113
Come get his weight.
How many active members is that 

1451
01:10:24,771 --> 01:10:25,604
community?
Yeah,

1452
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,440
well there's,
there's like,

1453
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,240
uh,
like 10,000

1454
01:10:29,241 --> 01:10:30,074
people on there,
but then there's really heavy people on 

1455
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:33,310
your heavy.
Uh,

1456
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,150
yeah.
How many hours a day are you on that?

1457
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:36,103
Well,
not as much now because if I use it at 

1458
01:10:37,461 --> 01:10:39,200
home,
they'll trace my ip.

1459
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,650
I'm like,
alright,

1460
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,153
I'm in deep know I,
the hatch should say unbanned Ian from 

1461
01:10:47,031 --> 01:10:49,460
the forum.
But that's funny.

1462
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:51,740
We got to pick up on those and you end 
well,

1463
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:56,750
thank you for decoding Kanye.
Rest in peace to Mac Miller.

1464
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:58,940
I see you're repping that.
They're on your hoodie.

1465
01:10:59,060 --> 01:10:59,893
Yes.
Rustin penned a and thanks so much for 

1466
01:11:02,061 --> 01:11:05,510
your presentation.
We will show you all the best you can.

1467
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,550
Leave it out.
Thank you so much.

1468
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:16,830
Thank you very much.
All right,

1469
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,510
so there you guys have it,
uh,

1470
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,030
the Kanye West d coded.
Hmm.

1471
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,690
What do you take away from that?
He led,

1472
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,840
do you think?
What do you think

1473
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:28,903
Ian is always making me like see the 
good in canyon that maybe I didn't save 

1474
01:11:33,101 --> 01:11:33,934
it.

1475
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,160
No.
Well,

1476
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,740
Ian,
he's a good cat.

1477
01:11:37,741 --> 01:11:40,950
He's got a strong head on his shoulders.
Um,

1478
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,900
so I,
I generally,

1479
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,610
he's got good ideas.
Yeah.

1480
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,570
So when he says that Kanye is his 
favorite person in the world,

1481
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:49,530
I listen.
Right.

1482
01:11:49,531 --> 01:11:50,640
And I'm like,
what's going on there?

1483
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:51,773
Actually started listening to his new 
album because of Ian's a doorstop and I 

1484
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,930
got to say,
there's a lot of the gravy cottey one.

1485
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:59,310
Yeah,
there's a lot of good stuff there.

1486
01:11:59,311 --> 01:12:00,850
So,
um,

1487
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:04,140
let's make America love again

1488
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,500
and it's,
it's tough to,

1489
01:12:06,501 --> 01:12:07,460
I,
like I said,

1490
01:12:07,461 --> 01:12:08,960
when I saw him with the hat,
I was like,

1491
01:12:08,961 --> 01:12:09,880
what?
Yeah,

1492
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:13,420
why?
But when you look more into it,

1493
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:15,780
I see what he's trying to do.
Oh,

1494
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:16,713
I see.

1495
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:20,570
Hey,
God bless it yet.

1496
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:25,990
All right,
well let's get into,

1497
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:26,973
um,

1498
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:28,780
yeah.

1499
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,060
Speaking of,
uh,

1500
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:33,190
conservatives,
Papa John is a prominent conservative.

1501
01:12:33,191 --> 01:12:34,024
Did you know that?
And he is currently under a huge 

1502
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:37,833
criminal conspiracy by the Clintons and 
George Soros to remove him from his 

1503
01:12:42,971 --> 01:12:45,270
pizza empire.
Can we close it?

1504
01:12:45,271 --> 01:12:45,881
Oh,
sorry.

1505
01:12:45,881 --> 01:12:47,880
Yeah,
that's me.

1506
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:52,740
Papa John has showed up to court today.
What does it,

1507
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:55,570
I think you just got to close that 
window there on the top right.

1508
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:57,250
Hey,
there we go.

1509
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:58,900
I was like,
okay.

1510
01:12:58,901 --> 01:12:59,734
There you go.
Papa John showed up in court today to 

1511
01:13:01,811 --> 01:13:04,990
testify in his lawsuit.
Papa John,

1512
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:08,110
the Papa John,
and he gave testimony.

1513
01:13:08,111 --> 01:13:11,710
He asked for documents.
There's a lot of big updates I'd like to

1514
01:13:11,711 --> 01:13:15,310
share with you guys as Johnny's Suing 
Papa John's.

1515
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,170
Yeah.
As the story unfolds,

1516
01:13:17,171 --> 01:13:18,460
we've got a video here.

1517
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:21,653
Here we go.

1518
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,053
Mr.
Schneider is set to begin testifying 

1519
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:26,700
modern,
as you mentioned the wrong,

1520
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:27,840
it's Shat Shat.
No,

1521
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:28,890
it's not her.
Okay.

1522
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,640
Papa John's Shatner's wife on air.
Yeah.

1523
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:36,650
Schneider should change it.
Yeah.

1524
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:37,763
She found her.
A former CEO and former chairman of the 

1525
01:13:39,871 --> 01:13:40,704
board is seeking documents related to 
his ouster as chairman earlier in the 

1526
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:44,843
summer.
Mr [inaudible] said he's feeling good 

1527
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:48,120
this morning ahead of his testimony.
Here's what else he had to say to us.

1528
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:51,540
What's your message to shareholders?

1529
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:59,020
You guys remember the Papa's in the 
house where he had the Lav on?

1530
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:00,693
Yeah.
And he didn't know that you could hear 

1531
01:14:01,991 --> 01:14:02,824
him.
He was gone.

1532
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,460
That's it.
Dead eight here a little bit.

1533
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,680
You can hear him gone.
There's

1534
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,053
right.

1535
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,070
Same message we would have for 34 years.
You know,

1536
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:22,940
we always act in their best interest.
What's your end goal here?

1537
01:14:22,941 --> 01:14:23,270
Do you

1538
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:25,100
better interest,
better pizza,

1539
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:29,270
better ingredients up at John's.
Always in their best interest.

1540
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:32,120
The quality is low because of this 
virtual desktop,

1541
01:14:32,121 --> 01:14:33,950
I think.
Okay.

1542
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:36,440
Yeah.
Although it should be yours,

1543
01:14:36,441 --> 01:14:37,430
not mine.
Well,

1544
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:39,440
we'll figure it out later.
I turned to the company and a leadership

1545
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,900
position of,
I don't want to be in a CEO position for

1546
01:14:42,901 --> 01:14:44,690
sure,
but you know,

1547
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:48,180
I uh,
I definitely want to be part of it and I

1548
01:14:48,181 --> 01:14:49,014
am part of the company.

1549
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:51,910
I am part of the company that you want.
What's the name of the company?

1550
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,850
What's the name of the company?
Papa John's.

1551
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:56,740
And who's the Papa?
Steve?

1552
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,120
No,
he's actually suing the company.

1553
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:03,850
And Steve,
he was going to fire Steve.

1554
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:05,043
Did you know there's the pizza gus and 
Gung Ho by Air Steve and now he's the 

1555
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:11,200
CEO.
Ah,

1556
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:12,423
it's a drama is so good.
I'm telling you they should rename the 

1557
01:15:14,921 --> 01:15:19,150
company at a pop.
Steve's Kinda Nevan the pizza boxes.

1558
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:23,350
No one's going to buy that.
Steve.

1559
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:27,610
My faith,
full employee one day.

1560
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,773
I'm cool.

1561
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,720
Steve.
I was going to let you go.

1562
01:15:34,721 --> 01:15:39,530
We'll go to part ways and now you've 
taken everything from me.

1563
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:42,150
Stevie.
You can take it in the mirror and her,

1564
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:43,683
you've taken the fresh 100% Mozzarella.
You've taken it all and now you're 

1565
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:54,481
changing the name to pump stevie.
I want it's better pizza,

1566
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:58,540
better ingredients.
And now stevie my faith.

1567
01:15:58,541 --> 01:15:59,374
Fuck out.
Come to me and you say you want no 

1568
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:09,690
problem.
My Heart's probably a couple of degrees.

1569
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:14,880
You have a call against the family and 
now I sit and quiet next to you,

1570
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:17,890
Stevie,
my colleague,

1571
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:18,873
my friend.
And you sit and you look many eyes and 

1572
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:25,900
you see this pizza.
And by that I built with my hands.

1573
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:31,690
You take the Mozzarella at Marin.
I needed the door.

1574
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:36,780
I Oman's Dave and you sit across from me
in court today at Uc Davis.

1575
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:46,213
Oh,
I won't for Papa John's is for the 

1576
01:16:49,431 --> 01:16:53,670
shareholders to make money better,
better pizza.

1577
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,030
And how might some,
boy,

1578
01:16:56,031 --> 01:16:59,000
he's a slow point.
My boat,

1579
01:16:59,001 --> 01:16:59,811
my son,
boy,

1580
01:16:59,811 --> 01:17:04,811
he doesn't have much prospects.
He's got no prospects TV.

1581
01:17:05,091 --> 01:17:07,300
You'd think as pizza.
Em,

1582
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:14,960
listen to this.
This is a real godfather tail.

1583
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:19,920
Um,
better interests.

1584
01:17:19,921 --> 01:17:22,080
Better Pizza.
I am part of Papa Joe.

1585
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:22,943
Here's part two.
You can go ahead and I feel like the 

1586
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:25,890
music companies,
the whole thing,

1587
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:32,700
this is all a huge betrayal.
Yeah.

1588
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,450
Here we go.
Hit me with it.

1589
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,970
Don't you fucking lag out on me.
Now.

1590
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:42,510
What about Internet?
Right?

1591
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,393
Josh satirize actually just wrapped up 
his testimony and we aren't getting on 

1592
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:48,900
his and his team to exit from the 
courthouse.

1593
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:53,430
This is one of two lawsuits that he's 
filed against the company.

1594
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:54,743
I hear he is just coming out right now.
You're going to get any comments from 

1595
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:57,714
[inaudible].
It has 17 different categories of 

1596
01:18:00,331 --> 01:18:03,450
documents that are related to his ouster
as chairman of the board today,

1597
01:18:03,451 --> 01:18:04,284
he really appeared calm and reserved.
That's in stark contrast to public 

1598
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:11,040
comments that he's made and also 
statements he's put out on his website.

1599
01:18:11,041 --> 01:18:11,874
Save Papa John's dot com it feels the 
company didn't properly protect him as 

1600
01:18:15,601 --> 01:18:16,434
founder.
After a Forbes reports that he'd used a 

1601
01:18:18,181 --> 01:18:19,014
racial slur on a conference call.
It was about a kind of using it as a 

1602
01:18:23,641 --> 01:18:27,480
racial epithet reports in the media 
mischaracterize what actually happened.

1603
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:30,210
Mr [inaudible] today also spoke of an 
intuition,

1604
01:18:30,211 --> 01:18:31,830
a sixth sense,
a gut feeling.

1605
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:32,843
It's something may have been going on 
with the company and that's why he's 

1606
01:18:35,761 --> 01:18:40,650
trying to seek documents that go back to
October 31st he made those.

1607
01:18:40,651 --> 01:18:44,100
Now Ms comments,
nfl and leadership,

1608
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:47,400
so he doesn't know if the board's 
actions and mount to a coup,

1609
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:51,150
a conspiracy or perhaps they are acting 
in the best interest of the company that

1610
01:18:51,151 --> 01:18:51,984
you want to obtain these documents to 
try and figure out really what happened 

1611
01:18:54,661 --> 01:18:55,494
here.
I also spoke to a source close to the 

1612
01:18:56,851 --> 01:18:57,684
company but at the Johns seemed a bit 
confused today about what documents he 

1613
01:19:00,391 --> 01:19:01,224
was asking for.
That is troubling because he is a 

1614
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:03,930
direct,
just want the,

1615
01:19:03,931 --> 01:19:08,130
I just want the mirror narrow,
clear about what he actually needed.

1616
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:11,430
Having that the company really looks 
forward to moving past these schemas and

1617
01:19:11,431 --> 01:19:14,640
creating a better papa John's a better 
culture for the company.

1618
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,133
Also,
we should mention that because we are 

1619
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:17,334
struggling to meet away from a decision.
It was unclear today if the judge from 

1620
01:19:21,121 --> 01:19:24,690
the bench,
but by showing again,

1621
01:19:24,691 --> 01:19:26,400
we're waiting comments from a John

1622
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:30,540
and now josh motto and now I'm assuming 
you going to point some down.

1623
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:32,270
Fuck this shit.
Fuck this shit.

1624
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:38,550
Stevie former colleague and best friend,
my a fighter like concierge.

1625
01:19:38,551 --> 01:19:41,710
See,
how do you call that advisor?

1626
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:47,390
Constantly air constantly there like the
Abbey because my consigliere nailed it.

1627
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:52,743
A lie ask is support to return the 
recipe of and my patented trademark and 

1628
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:04,360
Mozzarella cheese recipe.
Papa John's the Mozzarella.

1629
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,530
It's diff.
It's to milk.

1630
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:11,130
It's designed to melt evenly over the 
pizza.

1631
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:16,890
That's the pizza place.
I know.

1632
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,450
What's your stiff?
You break,

1633
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:20,163
you break.

1634
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,143
Okay.

1635
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,073
Stevie,
I have to take you on a lake and 

1636
01:20:26,461 --> 01:20:27,294
execute.

1637
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:28,723
Okay.

1638
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:38,410
Listen to this shit.
He requests 17 different documents,

1639
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:43,630
including the recipe of his Marinara 
sauce as a joke,

1640
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,750
but 17 documents Israel,
the pizza senses,

1641
01:20:46,751 --> 01:20:50,530
we're sensing a pizza conspiracy,
a coup or conspiracy.

1642
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:51,693
Papa speculated that foreign agents 
maybe act and covertly to overthrow his 

1643
01:20:55,151 --> 01:20:55,984
pizza empire,
possibly speculating that it was little 

1644
01:20:58,541 --> 01:21:02,460
seizures or possibly domine hose.
The I'm going,

1645
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:04,090
I did write this by the way.
I spent,

1646
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:08,810
I'm this morning right shares dom hose.
Yes.

1647
01:21:08,811 --> 01:21:09,644
Isla.
Thank you very much for acknowledging 

1648
01:21:10,631 --> 01:21:10,900
that

1649
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:15,900
common hope.
Everybody dominant hose.

1650
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:17,730
Yes.

1651
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:21,060
Only a great mind such as mine could 
such an original joke.

1652
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:25,350
Shares of the company have fallen more 
than 31% over the last year,

1653
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,393
but the company's whoa started long 
before Papa John was locked in a bitter 

1654
01:21:29,971 --> 01:21:30,804
battle since hitting an all time high of
90 cents per share in December of 2016 

1655
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:40,850
Papa John's stock has lost nearly half 
of its value on disappointing same store

1656
01:21:42,571 --> 01:21:44,010
sales growth.
On Monday,

1657
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:49,970
the stock was down more than 2% last 
changing hands at around $50 a share.

1658
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:54,360
So they,
they were already going down.

1659
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:55,583
This supports his pizza conspiracy that 
the company was not doing well and they 

1660
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:01,254
wanted him off because he was checking 
what I pulled up a isla pulled up 

1661
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:07,620
something he said he planned to fire 
currency.

1662
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:12,621
Oh Steve Richie who knew his performance
evaluation would be subpar.

1663
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:19,430
Wow.
And now stevie is the new pop this up on

1664
01:22:21,391 --> 01:22:24,270
the night of December 26

1665
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:25,983
that won't be a change of events.
The or formerly known as papa re Stevie 

1666
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:37,220
Richie,
but no longer control side.

1667
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:40,423
The shatner family is over and on the 
east side we are going to control the 

1668
01:22:45,891 --> 01:22:50,891
mirror and there were supply the moat 
Sylvana supplying the tomato supply.

1669
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,890
These boys,
the Ritchie family,

1670
01:22:55,891 --> 01:22:56,724
Dan.
Oh God,

1671
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,170
no.
On the trustworthy.

1672
01:22:58,171 --> 01:22:59,004
Then their performance is subpar.
And so what is my well as Grandpapa as 

1673
01:23:04,591 --> 01:23:05,424
the God

1674
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:09,530
that the sea,
oh richie shall be no more.

1675
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:15,030
And so on this day of December 26 pumper
Richie,

1676
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:21,710
because I give him a kiss and I said,
it's the kiss of faith

1677
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:30,350
and this time honored more Toronto,
this award winning Marin sauce torch.

1678
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,180
I get the deal,
my son,

1679
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:34,843
the,
the award winning cross that throw with 

1680
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:44,160
my own pants,
don't understand it's a pizza wall.

1681
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:45,390
We'll go into a wall.

1682
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:49,413
Here's the twist.
Here's a big twist within the 

1683
01:23:53,531 --> 01:23:54,364
proceedings,
he was asked whether he had some 

1684
01:23:56,441 --> 01:23:57,274
settlements with some women.
Shatner stated that he has 

1685
01:24:00,011 --> 01:24:00,844
confidentially agreements with at least 
two women but didn't specify what those 

1686
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:06,220
meant.
Uh,

1687
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,250
the woman,
24 year olds all the time sued,

1688
01:24:09,251 --> 01:24:12,220
shatter,
Shat Shat big shanty boy,

1689
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:13,054
Papa and 1999 alleging that he had 
sexually harassed her four months 

1690
01:24:16,961 --> 01:24:21,700
repeatedly visiting her house and 
kissing her and groping her according to

1691
01:24:21,701 --> 01:24:22,534
court filing,
Shatner has denied the allegations and 

1692
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:26,314
as they say,
papa is and will ever for be in the 

1693
01:24:28,841 --> 01:24:29,674
house.
What you just did when you sent that to 

1694
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:33,520
me?
So,

1695
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:34,443
um,
it's an interesting twist of fate for 

1696
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:37,654
papa because he went to seek documents 
to try to prove that it was a pizza 

1697
01:24:41,981 --> 01:24:42,814
conspiracy.
But what he did is he unsealed other 

1698
01:24:45,131 --> 01:24:48,820
documents about him being in the house 
with a,

1699
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:52,480
an employee that he allegedly kissed and
groped.

1700
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:57,130
Papa has denied the allegations.
Do you think the Papa,

1701
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,700
do you think he uses a lube when Esx or 
Marinara sauce?

1702
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:05,050
Probably the Bata.
You think he is a boiling pot of sauce?

1703
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,390
Yeah,
he probably does.

1704
01:25:07,391 --> 01:25:09,270
Doesn't he?
Hmm.

1705
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:11,230
Oh my God.
Oh right.

1706
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:14,560
Marlon Brando,
the Godfather,

1707
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:19,830
the guy that played the godfather was 
famously in a butter scene where he used

1708
01:25:20,231 --> 01:25:24,580
butter to lube up his cock to rape a 
girl in a movie in a movie.

1709
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:29,020
So there you have that.
Everything connects folks.

1710
01:25:29,021 --> 01:25:33,400
It's a small world after all as they 
say.

1711
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:34,900
So that's it.
That's that.

1712
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,270
You know what else we got?
We got facebook leak.

1713
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:39,280
Oh was yeah cause it,
Shit.

1714
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:41,490
Facebook sucks.
What's,

1715
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:46,550
what's like Mark Zuckerberg or smoking 
meats.

1716
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,153
CSEC is a potential sociopath.
That guy acts like a computer emulating 

1717
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:01,270
him.
That's the thing.

1718
01:26:01,271 --> 01:26:03,250
If you're going to sell,
I'm not a therapist,

1719
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:06,290
I'm just a fucking idiot.
Everyone becomes a sociopath.

1720
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,153
Yeah,
exactly.

1721
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:08,893
That's why I find it.
I'll just a little irresponsible the 

1722
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:11,654
therapist,
cause you're wielding trust like a 

1723
01:26:17,811 --> 01:26:20,010
doctor that,
I don't know if the therapist take o's,

1724
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:23,360
but doctors take boats.
That's serious stuff,

1725
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:27,260
you know?
Um,

1726
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:28,700
here.
So this,

1727
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:31,460
this story cracks me up.
This is amazing,

1728
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:33,100
amazing stuff.
Um,

1729
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:34,483
Dream cruise nightmare.
1300 Indians partying from a tobacco 

1730
01:26:41,691 --> 01:26:46,070
company,
went on a cruise with a 3000 other,

1731
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,510
I mean,
3000 people in total.

1732
01:26:47,511 --> 01:26:48,344
So half of those from these Indian 
company and half was Australian people 

1733
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:56,950
or just not just for vacation.
And these guys just don't took over this

1734
01:26:57,801 --> 01:27:00,530
cruise ship.
They brought playboy playmates,

1735
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,600
they brought music,
they brought their own food,

1736
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:06,570
and they just completely terrorized this
cruise and everybody was trapped on this

1737
01:27:06,571 --> 01:27:10,130
cruise and it was so bad that Royal 
Caribbean's had,

1738
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:15,020
they're very fond everybody.
But there's just hilarious footage of,

1739
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:18,230
um,
of all this.

1740
01:27:18,231 --> 01:27:19,064
And it was like a 24 hour nightmare.
And the Saas Jillian station made this 

1741
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:24,200
really hilarious,
like scoop,

1742
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:27,060
very serious.
Um,

1743
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:30,800
they were very serious about it,
you know,

1744
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,980
which I,
I just was loving this whole thing.

1745
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:37,130
Cruise ruined by 1300 men on a work 
bender.

1746
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,553
Here we go.

1747
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:43,190
It was supposed to be the cruise of a 
lifetime.

1748
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:44,024
But these excited ozzy families for them
soon got a sick feeling when they 

1749
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:52,520
realized they were sharing the ship with
1300 men on a work bender,

1750
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:53,520
our work

1751
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:57,690
Banda,
they turned

1752
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:01,570
family cruise until like they set up 
like a strip club.

1753
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:03,100
Hey,
believe this shit.

1754
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:03,993
These guys are the best and they're all 
just out there with their phones out on 

1755
01:28:08,061 --> 01:28:08,950
shit like,
God,

1756
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:10,653
I love it.
I love it that a company was able to 

1757
01:28:14,801 --> 01:28:19,801
just ruin a whole crew's paper like 
traumatized.

1758
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:21,490
They said,
yeah,

1759
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:22,953
randomly.
Like they kept their doors open and you 

1760
01:28:24,731 --> 01:28:27,030
were just walking by and not knowing 
where you're going to see.

1761
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:27,630
Yup.

1762
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:30,290
Some fucking naked Indian too.
There's nothing though.

1763
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:31,913
Love it.

1764
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:35,010
Sorry.

1765
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:36,870
They're in the pool.
They're dominating everything.

1766
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:40,480
It was luck as the chain.
Hundred Bucks.

1767
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:41,543
Not Pretty much.
They would just papers everywhere when 

1768
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,830
we didn't get our sail away party and it
was taken over by them.

1769
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:50,880
That was the beginning of the end.

1770
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,243
Disappointed.
I'm sure these other colorful words I 

1771
01:28:53,421 --> 01:28:54,254
would use when truck dance teacher,
one cass and their daughter Talia 

1772
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:02,070
boarded.
The reason we focus on the personal

1773
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,640
story of like people's Christine and her
hubby,

1774
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:07,043
they were all looking forward to their 
best cruise yet every day was getting 

1775
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:14,850
closer or was it just the heartbeats 
pumping out going crazy.

1776
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:17,850
But I know just don't go on a cruise.
I mean guys,

1777
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:20,580
cruising is like the ocean version of 
Zip lining.

1778
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:24,400
I always say that it probably had zip 
lines on that curve.

1779
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:27,900
Zip Lines are so stupid and I've never 
been on a cruise.

1780
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,730
I thought about it.
I haven't been one.

1781
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:30,931
It's awful,
right?

1782
01:29:30,931 --> 01:29:31,764
Yeah.
Every time I hear someone was on a 

1783
01:29:32,911 --> 01:29:34,560
cruise,
it sounds so bad.

1784
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:36,630
And the worst part about it is that 
you're in the middle.

1785
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:40,170
You cannot fucking escape that.
Oh,

1786
01:29:40,510 --> 01:29:41,530
I had a friend who went racing

1787
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:44,570
and you have this cluster phobic tiny 
room.

1788
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,180
Hmm.
So you can't even let it go to your room

1789
01:29:47,181 --> 01:29:48,014
too if you're like Dang people over or 
you want to go to your woman's tiny and 

1790
01:29:52,581 --> 01:29:54,590
don't even get me started on rogue 
waves.

1791
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:56,723
What's that?

1792
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:59,570
I'd like you to start.
Don't even get me started.

1793
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:01,430
Rogue waves,
dude,

1794
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:04,850
are anomalies on the ocean.
Okay.

1795
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:06,440
Oh yeah.
He was scared of waves.

1796
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:08,540
Rural waves.
My Dude's,

1797
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:13,810
it's when it's when seemingly n 
seemingly normal waves.

1798
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:20,450
There's a frequency when they can all 
just by some fluke of statistics,

1799
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:21,583
we're like 50 waves.
Wave lengths can line up and make one 

1800
01:30:25,431 --> 01:30:28,280
mega wave out of the ocean out of 
random,

1801
01:30:28,281 --> 01:30:29,114
and I'm telling,
I'm not making that is a well observed 

1802
01:30:30,711 --> 01:30:32,540
phenomenon.
Rogue waves.

1803
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:34,220
There's videos of it.
I swear to God.

1804
01:30:34,221 --> 01:30:35,810
Go on Google and type of rogue wave.
In fact,

1805
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,673
Ila,
why don't you do that and throw it on 

1806
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:38,250
the screen?

1807
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:42,430
Thanks Craig.
Pregnant ass Ila.

1808
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:45,660
I don't know what that means.
Oh,

1809
01:30:45,670 --> 01:30:47,970
it's under you.
It goes on their ear stuff.

1810
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:49,510
Row Waves,
guys.

1811
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:51,610
Oh,
this is stupid.

1812
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,410
Which is wait,
and we've got to go to Vegas.

1813
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:54,730
Oh,
can I not click your screen?

1814
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:57,060
Can you know?
Oh,

1815
01:30:57,070 --> 01:30:59,350
this is confusing,
but a videos.

1816
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,033
Wait,
wait.

1817
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:03,240
What has happened?
It just clicks.

1818
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:07,630
Really low lag here.
The second one.

1819
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:09,550
That one looks too like click.
Baity.

1820
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,400
They all know.
Yeah.

1821
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:13,103
Porter joint.
All right,

1822
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:14,980
I'll come on.
What's the middle class?

1823
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:17,620
Why don't we have a AD block for 
Christ's sake.

1824
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:18,820
We're doing a show here.

1825
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,353
Okay,

1826
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:29,670
well it's real.
I'm telling you.

1827
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:30,880
Do some research.
Go off there.

1828
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:31,743
Rogue waves.
They're out there and you think you're 

1829
01:31:34,721 --> 01:31:35,554
safely on the cruise.
You think those 1300 Indian men with 

1830
01:31:38,171 --> 01:31:39,004
their balls out and uh,
and their hotel room with the door open 

1831
01:31:42,461 --> 01:31:43,960
is bad.
Rogue waves.

1832
01:31:43,961 --> 01:31:44,794
My Dude,

1833
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:48,740
I dunno,
that doesn't

1834
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:51,680
rogue waves anyone.
Whatever.

1835
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:54,590
I just think the crazy favorite.
Go Open Up.

1836
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:57,170
Open a clip of cruise ship on,
on,

1837
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,240
uh,
troubled.

1838
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,093
See,

1839
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,473
I'm telling you this shit's amazing.
I've like people getting like toss 

1840
01:32:04,141 --> 01:32:06,460
around with furniture and shit.
It's amazing.

1841
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:10,330
Yeah.
He won't caught me dead on those boats,

1842
01:32:10,331 --> 01:32:12,880
man.
Apparently you can gamble though,

1843
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:13,753
Mike.

1844
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:15,020
Yeah,

1845
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:18,620
there's prostitutes because it's 
illegal.

1846
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:23,120
That sounds to bottom click on royal 
Caribbean not on recruitment.

1847
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:23,993
Sure.
Why not?

1848
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:28,730
Unless you're with 1300 Indians from a 
tobacco company.

1849
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,430
It's on the conduct of a gamble there.
You're right about that.

1850
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:37,810
Imagine the company brought like prepaid
prostitutes.

1851
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:43,250
Everyone's just taken a turn.
What do we got here?

1852
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:47,150
The lag is Karna.

1853
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:49,783
Tough.

1854
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,660
No sound.
Yeah,

1855
01:32:53,661 --> 01:32:54,181
it was just,
all right.

1856
01:32:54,181 --> 01:32:55,014
Let's see.
All right.

1857
01:32:55,430 --> 01:32:56,280
Yeah,
this is tough.

1858
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:58,110
This is a tough one.
But imagine being on that.

1859
01:32:58,111 --> 01:33:00,600
That's a rogue wave.
My Dude's watch out for that.

1860
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,190
All right.
Any rate love were,

1861
01:33:02,191 --> 01:33:03,740
where were we?
We were watching the stamp video.

1862
01:33:03,741 --> 01:33:07,230
I'm getting off track here.
We've got important things to talk about

1863
01:33:07,231 --> 01:33:09,600
obviously and uh,
let's stay on track.

1864
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,333
Skip ahead.

1865
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,490
Moved into voyage of,
of the sleeve.

1866
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:17,260
No price on,
um,

1867
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:21,370
because they would just stare and make 
us feel really uncomfortable.

1868
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:26,560
The families got that feeling from the 
push off where we were seated on the,

1869
01:33:26,561 --> 01:33:29,260
on the pool deck.
We were actually asked to move.

1870
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,333
We did because we thought these people 
were from Royal Caribbean but they were 

1871
01:33:33,491 --> 01:33:38,470
actually from the private party asking 
us to move so they could sit up there.

1872
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:40,480
And so we thought,
okay,

1873
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:41,314
they're sitting up for the sail away 
party but as a love how serious it is 

1874
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:49,580
still like would you like to comment to 
our news room and up the sail away party

1875
01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:54,850
made room to these high jinks on the 
high seas is the pool deck.

1876
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:55,750
Because one guy,
Dennis,

1877
01:33:55,751 --> 01:34:00,751
sweaty mess if gyrating body,
I've never seen so many mobile phones in

1878
01:34:01,991 --> 01:34:02,824
my life.

1879
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:04,470
Oh dear God.
Yeah.

1880
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:05,553
Um,
no.

1881
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:08,530
Anyway,
this feels wrong but um,

1882
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:09,963
of it,
I just love the idea of 1300 and Dan 

1883
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,530
just taken all so much.
Just like what?

1884
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,100
I don't know.
You got to love it.

1885
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,570
And this is,
you know,

1886
01:34:24,490 --> 01:34:25,323
this is the top notch content that you 
can come to expect here on h three 

1887
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:30,020
podcast experience.
Okay.

1888
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:32,093
Um,
there's one clip here that I absolutely 

1889
01:34:36,431 --> 01:34:37,264
want to watch with you guys and then 
we'll get some fans emissions wash this 

1890
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:46,210
pasture claims.
I love this clip so much.

1891
01:34:46,211 --> 01:34:50,290
I love these guys.
He gets in front of his congregation and

1892
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:55,120
he says if you do not give 10% of your 
whole income to the church,

1893
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:57,280
you are robbing God

1894
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:00,770
even if you are in debt.
What do they call that?

1895
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:01,970
A death.
A tilth.

1896
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:04,400
There's a saying that it's a part of 
height,

1897
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:05,493
a type of being Catholic or Christian.
You're supposed to donate 10% of your 

1898
01:35:08,571 --> 01:35:10,010
income to the church.
Really?

1899
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:13,500
Man,
I ain't no fucking church word that send

1900
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:14,343
me to hell.
I'm keeping that 10% I already paid 

1901
01:35:15,441 --> 01:35:18,350
fucking 50% the Uncle Sam,
what does he do for me?

1902
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:21,590
Shit,
you kidding me?

1903
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:27,140
10% is that all it takes to get into 
heaven?

1904
01:35:27,141 --> 01:35:28,730
10% fuck it.
I'll go to hell

1905
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:33,950
and rob guy,
he says,

1906
01:35:33,951 --> 01:35:36,690
you're robbing me.
What are you robbing me of times?

1907
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:37,940
Now,
what is the tab?

1908
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:39,373
A tithe is 10% he says,
you're robbing me of both tithes and 

1909
01:35:43,281 --> 01:35:48,281
offerings.
The 10% is what is what God requires and

1910
01:35:48,561 --> 01:35:49,394
then they all drinks.
Oftentimes some may require more than a 

1911
01:35:51,531 --> 01:35:55,160
10% some this cannot,
cannot,

1912
01:35:55,161 --> 01:36:00,161
cannot live off that not live on 10% do 
you understand why this is so weird?

1913
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,040
You said that you don't know.
How much did I have?

1914
01:36:03,041 --> 01:36:03,874
What do you think?
Be deeply in debt and then real trouble 

1915
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:07,243
did he,
he is going to be hard for you to 

1916
01:36:08,901 --> 01:36:10,220
believe that.
I'm telling you.

1917
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:12,650
I'm seeing it over and over and over 
again.

1918
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:13,903
You want to get out of debt.
It's be around Ivan lift you so you 

1919
01:36:15,921 --> 01:36:20,921
start start giving God 10% of your rent 
account,

1920
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:24,060
but there's no way I could do that.
Just try it.

1921
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:28,640
Just try it.
I dare.

1922
01:36:28,641 --> 01:36:30,200
You can always use his pride.
He's like,

1923
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:34,130
you don't listen to her house fan page.

1924
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,660
Hmm.
So there you have it.

1925
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:42,980
God cannot live on 10% that's so weird 
because I've always liked sin.

1926
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,570
Like if I would go to a synagogue when I
was a kid,

1927
01:36:48,571 --> 01:36:49,830
when my mom,
they would be like,

1928
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:52,320
can you donate anything?
Like anything.

1929
01:36:52,321 --> 01:36:53,550
It's a blessing.
Yeah.

1930
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,890
You mean they have some staff,
some like,

1931
01:36:55,950 --> 01:37:00,950
like a dollar and humility.
God cannot live without Yo 10% Dan,

1932
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:05,443
do you Jesus.
I recently went out to lunch and I tip 

1933
01:37:14,551 --> 01:37:15,890
my sweet server.

1934
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:20,940
I gave him 20% now why don't I get 20% 
Lord?

1935
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:25,950
Now I don't care if you're broke.
If you miss in the kidney,

1936
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:30,120
if you got cancer,
if you can't pay your debt,

1937
01:37:30,121 --> 01:37:31,230
boy,
I don't give up.

1938
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:32,870
I don't.
God doesn't get,

1939
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:37,440
you can't live on 10 but set by now.
You want to be good with Jesus.

1940
01:37:37,441 --> 01:37:40,920
You best be given me at least 10% of 
everything you aren't boy.

1941
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:46,530
Cause let me tell you what,
ain't no 5% b.

1942
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:51,090
Buy me a private jet because I got to 
pray all over this country.

1943
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:56,360
Boy,
you think I cannot save on 5% people and

1944
01:38:00,061 --> 01:38:01,950
that's right here in the Bible.
That's that Tif.

1945
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:03,023
Uh,
Tif.

1946
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:04,460
No.
Yes.

1947
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:05,293
Jesus by help me Lord.
And how am I supposed to afford these 

1948
01:38:09,511 --> 01:38:10,860
little tiny crosses,
the mark,

1949
01:38:10,861 --> 01:38:15,660
the boys that I want to molest?
Yes Lord,

1950
01:38:15,661 --> 01:38:18,350
I need,
I feel that 10% hmm.

1951
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:23,800
Preach.
If your kidneys failing,

1952
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:24,810
boy,
give me that kidney.

1953
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:28,230
I'll sell it on the black market.
That's 10% you good with Jesus.

1954
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:33,220
You know you need medicine to save your 
life.

1955
01:38:33,221 --> 01:38:35,260
Give me some of that medicine.
I'll sell it on the black market.

1956
01:38:35,261 --> 01:38:36,430
10% boy,
you feel me?

1957
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:37,990
Yay.
Get Amen.

1958
01:38:42,490 --> 01:38:43,640
Amen.
Brother.

1959
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:46,220
Oh,
you want me to give 10% she and I'm with

1960
01:38:46,221 --> 01:38:50,960
the church.
I'll give 10% I give 10% I am God.

1961
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:54,230
Now let me touch your kids deck.
Hey Man,

1962
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:57,950
can I touch your kids deck?
Amen,

1963
01:38:57,951 --> 01:38:59,690
Bro.
Hmm.

1964
01:39:01,370 --> 01:39:02,203
Jesus.
Are you telling me that Jesus didn't 

1965
01:39:05,631 --> 01:39:10,330
touch at least one baby penis?
At least one I may come on.

1966
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:12,603
Right.
You know Jesus at least look at a baby 

1967
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:17,600
dead.
Am I right?

1968
01:39:17,930 --> 01:39:22,930
Can I get an amen?
10% by I could the Christians I could.

1969
01:39:23,241 --> 01:39:28,241
Then they're good people to the fence.
There's a 101 he was like,

1970
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,833
oh,

1971
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:33,870
I get,
I kid the Christians,

1972
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:35,820
they're good people.
The Catholics,

1973
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:37,433
they're great.
Amen.

1974
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:42,900
Amen.
I was researching with all these kind of

1975
01:39:42,901 --> 01:39:43,734
goofy pasture videos and there's just 
one other one I want to show you guys 

1976
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:50,440
and Isla you are going to love this.
Okay.

1977
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:53,940
This is incredible stuff

1978
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,960
in Calgary.
Oh,

1979
01:39:56,961 --> 01:39:57,794
his name was ben and that was running.
You could buy was there for a few years 

1980
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:02,990
and um,
was just,

1981
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,900
he was a nice kid who was one of those 
kids that was always just,

1982
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:09,890
it's a real smart Alec who's this?
What's was a bright kid,

1983
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:11,530
which didn't help things,
right.

1984
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:12,373
Made it more dangerous outside one day.
And he was just just trying to push my 

1985
01:40:18,231 --> 01:40:19,260
buttons and it was just,
you know,

1986
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:24,370
kind of not taking the lord serious.
And I walked over to him and I went,

1987
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:29,690
I punched him in the chest as hard as I 
crop will the kid,

1988
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:35,650
I just came in brother and I said,
I leaned over and I said,

1989
01:40:35,811 --> 01:40:38,240
Ben,
when are you going to stop playing games

1990
01:40:38,241 --> 01:40:41,510
with God?
I let that man to the Lord right there.

1991
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,000
There's times that that might be needed.

1992
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:45,270
That man,
the Lord right there.

1993
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:50,430
He'd been in prison for 20 years now.
I love that.

1994
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:51,690
You know,
everyone listening was like,

1995
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:54,070
what?
And I walked over to

1996
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,903
that little 13 chest as hard as I could 
and I laid them out on the ground and I 

1997
01:41:00,191 --> 01:41:01,024
said,
boy,

1998
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:02,673
when am I getting that 10% because I 
know your mama gave you $5 a week in 

1999
01:41:05,981 --> 01:41:09,170
allowance.
And to me that's 50 cents a week by word

2000
01:41:09,171 --> 01:41:13,430
at 10% hmm.
That's when that boy found God.

2001
01:41:14,930 --> 01:41:17,780
You've been in prison now for 20 years 
for murder.

2002
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:22,100
That boy ain't right.
I love that story,

2003
01:41:22,101 --> 01:41:24,230
man.
I love that story.

2004
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:26,270
Yeah.

2005
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:27,103
Oh,
so good.

2006
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:30,770
Anyway,
let's move it on to fans submissions.

2007
01:41:30,771 --> 01:41:31,604
Okay.
Now this is 

2008
01:41:32,181 --> 01:41:36,950
podcast@hthreehthreeproductions.com.
You guys can send it questions,

2009

This is so much fun.

2012
01:41:41,781 --> 01:41:42,614
So this one comes from clammy hippo.
I watched a shrew podcasts for the same 

2013
01:41:47,061 --> 01:41:47,894
reasons.
Everyone else to make sure I have the 

2014
01:41:49,131 --> 01:41:50,720
correct opinion.
Thank you very much.

2015
01:41:50,721 --> 01:41:51,554
You do have the correct opinion,
the recent debates on how you wipe your 

2016
01:41:53,661 --> 01:41:56,360
arse.
Apparently this friend comes from across

2017
01:41:56,361 --> 01:41:58,130
the seas,
have been Imez,

2018
01:41:58,250 --> 01:41:59,083
immersive and captivating and I want to 
just slam dunk a little debate here 

2019
01:42:02,571 --> 01:42:04,580
myself.
Do you piss in the shower?

2020
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:08,450
I've asked around in the answer is about
50 50 as a proud shower.

2021
01:42:08,451 --> 01:42:10,520
Pissed or myself,
I need to tell you.

2022
01:42:10,521 --> 01:42:13,220
I need you to tell me if I should stop 
pissing the shower or carry on.

2023
01:42:13,221 --> 01:42:16,730
Just letting it rip.
Also on a little bit of a side note,

2024
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:17,623
I'm not sure this is a stupid question,
but I'm sure you and everyone else does 

2025
01:42:19,941 --> 01:42:20,774
it,
including me.

2026
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:24,050
Do Shit,
but do you shit in the bath?

2027
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:29,660
We simply need to know.
Well,

2028
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:32,360
claimy hippo first,
let me start with the first part because

2029
01:42:32,361 --> 01:42:33,194
you took a quick turn.
They're peeing in the shower to me is a 

2030
01:42:37,701 --> 01:42:40,280
beautiful natural thing.
It's like pink outside.

2031
01:42:40,281 --> 01:42:42,920
It's like,
it's a beautiful thing where you don't,

2032
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:45,230
I love being in the shower.
I,

2033
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,220
I,
when I read this,

2034
01:42:46,221 --> 01:42:48,980
I was shocked that why would you not pee
in the shower?

2035
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:54,320
I pee on 11 we're in the shower now.
Dan Zak.

2036
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:57,890
And Do you guys pee in the shower?
You know,

2037
01:42:57,891 --> 01:43:00,230
I don't go out of my way to but,
but sure.

2038
01:43:00,290 --> 01:43:01,040
I mean,
I do.

2039
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,060
If the,
if you go,

2040
01:43:02,061 --> 01:43:04,730
you hold it to hold it in the shower.
I mean,

2041
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:10,400
I think that p 100% of the time,
I know hour because you're relaxed.

2042
01:43:10,401 --> 01:43:11,510
It's warm.
You're comfortable.

2043
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:13,160
Ian And Zach,
Do you pee in the shower?

2044
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:16,183
Zach says,
hell yeah.

2045
01:43:16,410 --> 01:43:18,590
And I think Ian said,
Nah,

2046
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,860
he had,
he had recently such a contrarian,

2047
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:27,350
just like conscious.
Now why do you not pee in the shower?

2048
01:43:27,351 --> 01:43:28,940
Dan and Ian.
I mean I'm just,

2049
01:43:28,941 --> 01:43:31,960
do you think that it's gross?
But yeah,

2050
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:35,360
I mean apparently you go out of your way
to you like actually enjoy it.

2051
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:40,420
I do enjoy like if you're sitting in 
your own in the bedroom,

2052
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:42,653
you pee in the bat.
I don't have you done baking tips it 

2053
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:49,480
back.
Chris Evans takes a bath probably.

2054
01:43:49,910 --> 01:43:53,390
It's crafted that tweet.
He was in the bathtub being in it now.

2055
01:43:53,391 --> 01:43:54,224
And do you find it gross?
What is it about shopping in the shower 

2056
01:43:56,211 --> 01:43:57,044
that,
that I have roommates and it just 

2057
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:03,290
doesn't seem respectful really.
I who goes down with the water?

2058
01:44:03,291 --> 01:44:05,660
Who Cares?
I don't know.

2059
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:06,680
I just,
yeah.

2060
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:09,530
Well I appreciate,
do you jerk off in the shower?

2061
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:10,753
I know because jerking off in the shower
fucking nasty because it can get caught 

2062
01:44:14,571 --> 01:44:15,404
in the drain.
And I've actually had roommates where 

2063
01:44:17,610 --> 01:44:20,660
they jerk off in the shower and you can 
see it in the drain and that,

2064
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:23,180
oh no,
I'm telling you that shit ain't right.

2065
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:25,053
So I would say that jerking off in the 
shower with roommates is a little 

2066
01:44:28,431 --> 01:44:29,450
stickier.
Well,

2067
01:44:29,451 --> 01:44:31,650
it's none of that is as bad as this 
guy's second.

2068
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:33,920
But then he gets it.
He says,

2069
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:37,010
I'm sure this is a stupid question.
I'm sure you and everyone else does it,

2070
01:44:37,011 --> 01:44:38,750
including me,
but do you shit in the bath now?

2071
01:44:38,751 --> 01:44:42,350
I think he's making chain,
but obviously shitting in the bath is,

2072
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:44,020
I'm not,
this person's not Siri.

2073
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:46,490
Sociopath.
Yeah,

2074
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:51,080
I think you have to be homeless or 
something.

2075
01:44:51,081 --> 01:44:52,390
I know how,
I don't know.

2076
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:54,950
I would never shitting in the bath.

2077
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:55,783
That can't be what,
I'll tell you a funny story about 

2078
01:44:56,961 --> 01:44:58,670
shitting in the bath though.
I had,

2079
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:03,710
I live with two dudes in college and we 
used to play a game called doopy extreme

2080
01:45:03,711 --> 01:45:04,544
where where you tried to run an 
elaborate dupe on one of the housemates 

2081
01:45:08,030 --> 01:45:08,863
did the other two were on,
you would try to make them believe some 

2082
01:45:10,761 --> 01:45:12,560
far fetched,
outrageous thing.

2083
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:15,770
And so this was my crowning achievement.
I with the other guy,

2084
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:16,993
we decided to try to convince our third 
roommate who was kind of a Germaphobe 

2085
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:24,410
that we shit in the shower and that it's
normal and everybody fits in the shower.

2086
01:45:24,411 --> 01:45:26,240
So here's what I did.
This was fun.

2087
01:45:26,241 --> 01:45:27,074
I'm proud of this way.
So I arranged it with the other friend 

2088
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,540
and then I called a fourth friend and 
said,

2089
01:45:32,541 --> 01:45:34,370
hey,
we're doing this prank.

2090
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:36,620
I'm going to call you and I want you to 
say that you,

2091
01:45:36,621 --> 01:45:38,210
of course you see shit in the shower.

2092
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:40,250
So I was like,
oh bro.

2093
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:42,740
Um,
I was like,

2094
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:44,360
hey,
just giving them an I shit in the shower

2095
01:45:44,361 --> 01:45:46,130
when I was in there and he's like,
you did what?

2096
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:48,110
And we've gotten this whole thing.
I was like,

2097
01:45:48,111 --> 01:45:48,920
yeah,
you shouldn't.

2098
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:49,753
The shower.
I push it down with my toes down the 

2099
01:45:51,351 --> 01:45:52,910
drain.
It's normal.

2100
01:45:52,911 --> 01:45:54,290
My whole family,
everybody does that.

2101
01:45:54,291 --> 01:45:55,124
And he's like,
he's like telling me you guys are 

2102
01:45:57,141 --> 01:45:58,280
kidding.
He was like,

2103
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:01,700
I can't you tell he was dead serious.
He was like,

2104
01:46:02,090 --> 01:46:05,270
tell me you guys are fucking kidding.
Like you don't Shit in the shower.

2105
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:07,460
And then my third roommate comes in,
he's like,

2106
01:46:07,461 --> 01:46:08,420
yeah,
I shouldn't have shower too.

2107
01:46:08,421 --> 01:46:09,254
You push it down with your toes,
you stomp it down with your tufts and 

2108
01:46:12,291 --> 01:46:13,700
he's like,
you guys are fucking with me.

2109
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:16,670
And then we called up the fourth friend 
and I was like,

2110
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:19,090
I'm talking to Isaac,
we shit in the shower.

2111
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:20,580
He doesn't believe it,
but you shouldn't have shower.

2112
01:46:20,581 --> 01:46:20,931
Right?
He's like,

2113
01:46:20,931 --> 01:46:22,130
yeah,
everybody should sit in the shower,

2114
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,233
stomp it down with our toes.
And he's sitting there having like a 

2115
01:46:25,851 --> 01:46:30,851
mental breakdown like on to have a name 
for it.

2116
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:33,320
We called it,
we did,

2117
01:46:33,321 --> 01:46:35,040
I don't remember what it was.
Yeah,

2118
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:36,680
the waffle stomp I think.
Yeah,

2119
01:46:36,681 --> 01:46:39,200
we called it a waffle stump when you 
yeah,

2120
01:46:39,201 --> 01:46:42,500
exactly.
And so a waffle stomp.

2121
01:46:42,501 --> 01:46:44,510
Exactly.
So we convinced him for a good,

2122
01:46:44,511 --> 01:46:46,910
like 20 minutes that we will feel 
stumped,

2123
01:46:46,911 --> 01:46:49,680
shit them down the,
so no,

2124
01:46:49,681 --> 01:46:50,514
I do not shit in the bathtub.
And I sincerely do hope that you do not 

2125
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:54,053
it in the basket of,
and then nobody fits in the bath tub 

2126
01:46:55,321 --> 01:46:57,480
because that ain't sanitarian.
Frankly,

2127
01:46:57,481 --> 01:46:59,090
you don't need to be waffle stomping 
poop.

2128
01:46:59,100 --> 01:46:59,933
We have,
we have systems plumbing in place to 

2129
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:05,160
handle that and I sincerely hope they 
use it.

2130
01:47:05,161 --> 01:47:09,750
So thank you for the question submitted 
from Danny Kelly.

2131
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,380
This clip is just fucking amazing.
I have never seen this.

2132
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:15,360
And it's one of my favorite things I've 
ever seen.

2133
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:16,433
I gave me so much joy and so much 
laughter and I share it with you all 

2134
01:47:18,271 --> 01:47:19,104
today.

2135
01:47:23,620 --> 01:47:27,450
Shit.
Fucking how these shouting at Berg

2136
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:32,580

2137
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:37,860
Fucking mouth and it like takes it in.

2138
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:41,840
Oh God,
it's so bad.

2139
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:50,630
Tom and I went just as hard as I 
crumpled the kid.

2140
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:53,973
The kid.
When are you going to start taking 

2141
01:47:56,650 --> 01:47:57,483
Jesus?
Seriously not give me 50 cents 10% I 

2142
01:48:04,941 --> 01:48:05,774
know that's what Jesus wanted.
I think it said in the Bible it said 

2143
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:13,150
when disobedient crumple children with a
powerful punch to the chat.

2144
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:16,273
Hmm.

2145
01:48:18,670 --> 01:48:21,310
This is a weird on hello ron for the 
cube.

2146
01:48:21,311 --> 01:48:24,470
You guys may remember him from my recent
or not a little,

2147
01:48:25,870 --> 01:48:26,703
a hd video we made about this really 
weird kid channel where he's got this 

2148
01:48:34,121 --> 01:48:37,960
crazy voice,
but he reviewed one of ilos products and

2149
01:48:37,961 --> 01:48:42,961
a here for the queue for the QP.

can keep what?

2152
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:51,200
Do you understand what he's saying?
No,

2153
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:54,350
it would be really strong.
Strong,

2154
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:59,680
strong.
I I want that fucking scares me tightly.

2155
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:08,313

tiny to Ku title bean and see what 

2158
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:23,600

How do you feel right now?

2159
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:27,330

2163
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:40,110

This just so weird.

2164
01:49:40,111 --> 01:49:43,350

2168
01:49:49,741 --> 01:49:51,740

I want to try to reach out to them.

2169
01:49:52,350 --> 01:49:54,620
If you are watching this,
which you have a feeling he'll see it is

2170
01:49:56,070 --> 01:50:00,700
email us around the cube.
I want to connect with you.

2171
01:50:00,701 --> 01:50:01,534
Dude.
You're the weirdest fucking guy I've 

2172
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:06,810
ever heard of in my life.
But uh,

2173
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:07,653
anyway,
he was very gracious and he put a link 

2174
01:50:09,371 --> 01:50:11,410
in the description and stuff,
so that was nice.

2175
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:12,420
But my God,
I,

2176
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:15,970
I'm scared of him.
He's got a nice following,

2177
01:50:15,971 --> 01:50:17,550
like 70,000
views.

2178
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:21,690
Is that his normal viewer siblings?
Let me take a look and see.

2179
01:50:22,430 --> 01:50:26,050
Kind of used as this guy.
Usually Paul this.

2180
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:27,700
Oh,
it's the weirdest video.

2181
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:32,320
It's us as this trailer.
What the fuck we've ever seen?

2182
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:34,690
Steve's channel name is run for the 
cube.

2183
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:37,630
It should be a month from like you've 
got him.

2184
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:39,460
I'm funny man.
Oh,

2185
01:50:39,461 --> 01:50:43,270
he hasn't made a video and this was the 
last few we made two months ago and then

2186
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:47,140
six months after that.
Holy Shit.

2187
01:50:47,410 --> 01:50:51,160
This guy is obsessed with us here.
We're in his trailer.

2188
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:55,750
His last video he made,
he's hunting us down with those tweezers

2189
01:50:55,751 --> 01:50:56,584
and gloves on.

2190
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:57,483
Yeah.

2191
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:00,003
Cube Ron for your life.
Just take out the cute trailer goofing 

2192
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:03,880

2193
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:05,000
Oh Wow.

2194
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:08,210
Oh Man.
I guess run for the cute wait,

2195
01:51:08,211 --> 01:51:09,044
look at another video again.
Remember the vision for the next couple 

2196
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:12,830
of weeks.
Have you guys ever watch,

2197
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:18,850

Oh Hey,

2198
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:19,940
Yay.
Yay.

2199
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:22,330
Run from the hill.

2200
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:23,980
that was crazy.
Um,

2201
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:27,290
there you have it.
How did that make me feel?

2202
01:51:27,291 --> 01:51:28,760
He reviewed your,
uh,

2203
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:31,130
I guess honored,

2204
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:34,940
Cool.
And then Ella,

2205
01:51:34,941 --> 01:51:37,430

2213

01:52:57,180 --> 01:52:58,220
I'm excited.
Oh,

2233
01:52:58,290 --> 01:52:59,150
cool.
I love it,

2234
01:52:59,151 --> 01:53:00,200
man.
It came out so good.

2235
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:03,230
This is there.
There a mascot,

2236
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:04,093
the cat.
So the cat and the bear teamed up and 

2237
01:53:06,951 --> 01:53:09,950
they're crushing it man.
Um,

2238
01:53:10,820 --> 01:53:13,370
and finally,
thank you to all of our sponsors.

2239
01:53:13,371 --> 01:53:14,204
We have a little sponsor button on 
youtube that you can smash to the 

2240
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:17,654

Thank you very much to those of you who 

2241
01:53:19,681 --> 01:53:23,180

Thank you everyone who has a watched the

2242
01:53:23,181 --> 01:53:24,500
podcast.
Whoa.

2243
01:53:24,501 --> 01:53:27,980
Love you so very much.
Thank you Ian for the presentation.

2244
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:29,840
Thank you to Cognac.
Very cool.

2245
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:36,040
Add a,
have a blessed and Friday.

2246
01:53:36,361 --> 01:53:37,051
That's about it,
right?

2247
01:53:37,051 --> 01:53:38,280
I mean there's a,
I mean that's it,

2248
01:53:38,281 --> 01:53:39,114
right?
You know,

2249
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:43,620
I mean there's more stuff but it's close
to two hours.

2250
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:45,060
Yeah,
it's worth close to two hours.

2251
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:48,940
I start to lose steam at two hours.
Two hours gets bad.

2252
01:53:48,941 --> 01:53:49,774
And that's when I started talking about 
like pedophile priests and stuff and he 

2253
01:53:52,441 --> 01:53:53,350
was like,
oh,

2254
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:58,170
we already snuck in the music.
Oh,

2255
01:53:58,171 --> 01:53:59,004
you already,
you're already playing me off the booed 

2256
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:08,090
stage while guys join us next Friday for
another episode.

2257
01:54:09,790 --> 01:54:13,560
Looks pregnant.
She's still be pregnant.

2258
01:54:13,561 --> 01:54:15,330
Probably,
or not so weird.

2259
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:16,373
I don't know.
I'm just saying that people are so 

2260
01:54:17,041 --> 01:54:17,900
stupid.
I'm,

2261
01:54:17,901 --> 01:54:20,280
I'm being played off right now.
I know that I can't hear the music,

2262
01:54:20,281 --> 01:54:22,470
but my family was like,
no,

2263
01:54:22,471 --> 01:54:23,790
don't say anything.
They'll 10 weeks.

2264
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:25,140
Yeah.
It's like,

2265
01:54:25,141 --> 01:54:26,490
come on.
My family said,

2266
01:54:26,491 --> 01:54:29,820
don't say anything until four months.
I say,

2267
01:54:29,821 --> 01:54:32,640
don't say anything until the baby comes 
like halfway there.

2268
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:33,893
I say,
don't say anything until a year to make 

2269
01:54:34,681 --> 01:54:38,220
sure the baby's healthy.
You know,

2270
01:54:38,370 --> 01:54:41,070
we're in this journey together.
We've been very vocal about the process,

2271
01:54:41,071 --> 01:54:43,860
so we don't see any reason not to 
continue that trend.

2272
01:54:44,190 --> 01:54:46,620
Guys,
next week we'll hear again,

2273
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:49,160
have the blessing to beautiful Friday 
evening.

2274
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:50,760
The weekend is upon us.
We made it.

2275
01:54:51,690 --> 01:54:55,470
Thank God it's Friday and remember to 
give 10% boy.

2276
01:54:55,950 --> 01:54:58,290
Otherwise you're going to get punched in
the chest by your pasture.

2277
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:00,930
Thank you for watching.
Have a blessing.

2278
01:55:01,110 --> 01:55:03,000
Beautiful weekend and remember this

2279
01:55:05,630 --> 01:55:06,890
safe Papa john.com.

2280
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:14,620
All right,
we're good.
