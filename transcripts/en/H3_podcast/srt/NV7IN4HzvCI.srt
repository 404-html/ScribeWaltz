1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,150
Welcome to the h three podcast 
experience.

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,360
We're trying to compete with Joe Rogan 
over here.

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,253
Hell yeah.
My theory is that a podcast can never 

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,390
compete with an experience.
He's gotten an experience.

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,980
Right.
So I'm trying to,

6
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:25,220
even the playing field a little bit.
You need to see weed pills or something.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,713
Yes,
I need some kind of supplement 

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,660
experience supplement,
but they get to hymns.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,110
It Felix Gray and audible for sponsoring
us today.

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,060
And if you haven't already guessed 
today,

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,290
I would say are good.
Arguably the most successful youtuber of

12
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,400
all time.
Bieber.

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,110
Bieber.
Yeah,

14
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:43,160
I can't,
there's no argument.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,170
No fight number.
Can we say number two?

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,393
No,
because like the idea is that like if 

17
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:52,970
you make stuff outside of Youtube,
you're more successful.

18
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:55,340
I don't think that's true.
I'm saying like their youtube or is make

19
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:58,020
way more money than me.
More people.

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,360
I mean,
I don't think it's like,

21
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,730
you know,
it's legit and successful just cause you

22
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:04,360
know,
in my mind I feel like it,

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,480
there's some truth to it.

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,910
If you can escape in a way,
it's almost,

25
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:11,300
it is an escape because it,
it really frees you,

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,250
like what you do with your comedy acts 
is kind of not compatible with youtube.

27
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,720
You think?
Kind of,

28
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,820
I dunno.
Uh,

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,853
well it's like maybe,
maybe not the whole stage and the 

30
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:24,110
lighting and all the coordination and 
disappearing for a year.

31
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,670
Yeah.
Well that,

32
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,410
that's really why I left or not left eye
when I was,

33
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:29,990
you moved on.
I just wanted to do live stuff.

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,853
I mean,
even when I was posting the early 

35
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:34,250
videos,
like I just wanted to perform on stage,

36
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:35,690
I was doing theater.
That's where we want it to do.

37
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,420
When I was performing those videos,
like I'd be like,

38
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:39,254
I really want to go to stage with these.
And then I performed them on stage and 

39
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:41,864
if I had posted the video,
it wouldn't get that much of a reaction 

40
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:44,841
when you realized like,
Oh,

41
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:47,690
if I didn't post this stuff and people 
heard it for the first time and the room

42
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,170
was,
it was,

43
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,060
it was a exciting so,
well,

44
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:52,100
I didn't introduce you Bo Burnham.

45
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,920
Okay.
Um,

46
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,880
basically I would say one of the most 
beloved comedy acts for the past decade,

47
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,310
including two of my favorite,
what and make happy on Netflix.

48
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,610
Netflix.
What's on Youtube?

49
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,680
Yeah.
What's back on Netflix?

50
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,790
It's bad.
It's everywhere.

51
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,760
It's everywhere folks.
And he's just written and directed a new

52
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:13,130
movie that's out today on limited 
release,

53
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,900
right?
Nationwide in two weeks.

54
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,890
Yeah,
in New York and La.

55
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:17,960
And then it'll be out somewhere else.
Eighth Grade,

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,080
which by the way is getting rave reviews
and 98% on rotten tomatoes.

57
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,510
Whoa.
Let me hit you with the sound.

58
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:29,800
Soundbar 99 now they raised like,
you know what?

59
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,590
Fuck that 99.
Ooh,

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,500
can we get it to a hundred?
Can we off that one fucking loser?

61
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,373
No,
we can't.

62
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,850
Are you sure?
Go for it.

63
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,510
Yeah.
Can you and the interns on it?

64
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,680
He is where he's up to word scenario.
Not you're good.

65
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,110
I would tell if he had a book hanging 
on.

66
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:47,840
It's all good.
I wouldn't,

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,760
I wouldn't let you and with that I'm 
free,

68
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,880
but it does have 100% of my heart.
Appreciate it.

69
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,250
I went and I saw it last night.
It's very kind of,

70
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,980
I missed the screening and I absolutely 
loved it.

71
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,860
You missed the screening.
I missed the screening,

72
00:02:59,861 --> 00:02:59,980
so

73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,030
I went and saw it last night.
Oh,

74
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:01,451
okay.
Okay.

75
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:02,890
Okay.
Um,

76
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,510
how,
how are you feeling about it?

77
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,590
I mean,
the movie's out.

78
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,100
It's getting rave reviews.
It's getting rave reviews.

79
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,223
I'm feeling great.
I want to say I'm really grateful to be 

80
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,310
here.
I'm a fan of yours,

81
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,460
Ethan.
I'm a fan of the podcast.

82
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,690
It's true.
Um,

83
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,010
you know,
and um,

84
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,080
though I haven't been like posting a lot
on youtube.

85
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,970
I'm watching the shit all the time.
Yeah.

86
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,870
All the time.
I mean,

87
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,704
like my main relationship with the 
Internet is as a viewer and as someone 

88
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,000
just on,
can I ask,

89
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,500
who do you frequent?
I was like,

90
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,610
who do you like?
You're,

91
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,960
you know,
you're one of the few people,

92
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,050
like it's really popular that I watch.
I mean,

93
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:36,960
I don't know if it's like it to me,
but like I,

94
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,933
I,
it's sort of what the movie ended up 

95
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,144
being like,
I love people in the Internet that no 

96
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:42,880
one's watching.

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,680
Uh,
I love the review review,

98
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,470
Bruh.
I love him under review Bra,

99
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,600
the report of the week.
Oh yeah,

100
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:50,434
he's,
yeah,

101
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,980
he's a legend and incredible.
Um,

102
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,380
but I really love like people on the 
Internet that no one's watching.

103
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,890
So I'll often like search something and 
then view it by Upload Day.

104
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,800
I mean,
you're in the nitty gritty.

105
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,400
Yeah.
So I love deep dives.

106
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,234
Like there's this dude who's a hoarder 
who cooks hot dogs on candles and it's 

107
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:11,470
very nauseated and see,
have character or is it just the,

108
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,080
it's the intrigue of it all.
Does he have character?

109
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,810
Like it seemed very entertaining or no,
it's bone chilling.

110
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,541
It's chilling.
Yeah.

111
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:17,980
Yeah,
yeah.

112
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,440
It's like him.
Like can we show,

113
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,283
we give him a shout out.
I don't know his name and I don't know 

114
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,540
if he's in.
No,

115
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,393
but really it's like he takes a tour of 
his like hoarding house and he cooks 

116
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:29,014
like he called some sausages and there's
a video of him making sausages and 

117
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:32,250
peaches.

118
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,260
It's absolute incredible.
We could probably pull it up.

119
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,123
Yeah.
It's a lot of cooking sausages and it's 

120
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:42,511
really not the hot dogs.
And sausages or the PT calls it sausages

121
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,890
and peaches,
but it is most certainly hot dogs.

122
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,873
Okay.
Okay.

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,200
But no,
I just like,

124
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,180
I,
I've,

125
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,890
I dunno,
but yeah,

126
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,241
no,
I,

127
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:55,090
I've watched a lot of [inaudible] them 
from the background and I want to talk a

128
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:56,770
lot about that.
But first I want to ask like,

129
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,960
what was your motivation almost for 
writing this film?

130
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:01,870
Because it's a departure,
it's kind of a surprise to a lot of your

131
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:03,430
fans of like,
Oh wow,

132
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,740
where did this movie come from?
It's very specific.

133
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,431
Yeah,
it'd be too,

134
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,490
with a very specific narrative,
like you had a purpose.

135
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,720
So I'm wondering what,
what was,

136
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,660
what motivated you to go that route?
It was like,

137
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,970
it's about a girl,
like a 13 year old girl last week,

138
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:16,510
eighth grade.

139
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,310
And you know,
I did stand in for like,

140
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,110
and found it already by the way.
Amazing.

141
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,310
We'll cut it.
I,

142
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,763
it'll be,
it'll be a hard letting me Andreas 

143
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,170
conversation.
Um,

144
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,390
I I,
you know,

145
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,810
perform standup for a long time and I 
was feeling anxious and I wanted to sort

146
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:32,644
of talk about the internet and my own 
anxiety in a way and sort of I had felt 

147
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,754
like my anxiety for a long time.
It was like very specific to me being a 

148
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:41,680
25 year old comedian with like an 
audience.

149
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,903
Um,
and then I would like do my shows and 

150
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:48,880
like young kids would come up to me and 
say they felt like me and they felt like

151
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,803
they knew what I was going through.
Even when I was talking about was like 

152
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,740
being on stage in front of thousands of 
people.

153
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,150
I'm like,
why is this resonating with you?

154
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,220
Um,
and I just think that sort of pressures,

155
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:02,090
the weird pressures that are usually 
only afforded to like d list celebrities

156
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,160
have now been democratized and given to 
everybody.

157
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:08,150
So I was always interested in like,
who are telling a story about someone on

158
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:10,580
the Internet that nobody's watching.
Cause the Internet tends to end,

159
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:11,414
the culture at large tends to only talk 
about the people on the Internet that 

160
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:14,654
are being seen.
But the majority of people on the 

161
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,634
Internet and there's a lot more and more
who are just talking to the camera and 

162
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,174
nobody's watching.
That's 99% of the videos that are 

163
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,910
uploaded.
99.9

164
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,580
you know,
and the kind of,

165
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:28,670
the only thing we talk about is like 
people that go viral and as someone that

166
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,530
went viral,
it's really not that interesting.

167
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,693
You know what I mean?
It's like the actual interesting thing 

168
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:34,934
is just trying to engage with this thing
and trying to be seen and trying to be 

169
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:37,490
heard.

170
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,320
And to me the people that weren't being 
heard,

171
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:42,800
we're actually engaged in a much deeper,
more honest and thing.

172
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,023
Well there was one of the central themes
I think that I extracted from it was 

173
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:47,564
like how social media or this abundance 
of all this going on with youtube and 

174
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:53,174
twitter and instagram is affecting kids.
Cause I think when there's a five year 

175
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,464
difference between us,
but when I grew up there was no like 

176
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,443
grow hap as a kid was hard enough.
But then when you have all this new 

177
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:09,830
social media introduced to them and the 
way that you portray the girl,

178
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:12,170
how she's glued to the social media,
it was very accurate.

179
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:15,620
I think.
Like how is this affecting kids?

180
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,850
I don't know all the time is that I 
don't quite know exactly like,

181
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,723
and truly it was me wanting to talk 
about how it felt to me and how it felt 

182
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,480
to me was it made me feel nervous and 
weird and unsure of myself.

183
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,180
And that seems like,
I mean social media.

184
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,871
Yeah.
Yeah.

185
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,420
Just having to sort of represent 
yourself,

186
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,690
having to live your life and then also 
live your life on this other place.

187
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:39,380
And then the sense of like,
because of that floating behind yourself

188
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,510
through situations.
Um,

189
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,703
I just think it's like weird and 
disembodied and like a little 

190
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:49,121
disassociated or something.
But more than anything it was like I,

191
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,430
I'm happy for people to like leave the 
movie thinking about that stuff,

192
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,590
but I don't want the movie to be like a 
Ted talk or like,

193
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,400
I mean some like finger wagging shit 
cause that's what so annoys me.

194
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,121
It wasn't,
by the way,

195
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,970
let me just say one more thing.
Yeah,

196
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,120
but,
but like that,

197
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,013
I dunno,
it just feels like the Internet hasn't 

198
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:05,954
even,
in least in popular media hasn't even 

199
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,040
been described,
let alone figure it out.

200
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,180
Like so.
So,

201
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,351
um,
yeah,

202
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:18,560
I just wanted to portray it and portray 
it,

203
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,850
how it feels to her and me a little bit,
which is just weird.

204
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:24,110
It's just like,
it's a lot,

205
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,670
but it's not like,
it's just shitty.

206
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,620
It's not like,
it's like we should just,

207
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:27,454
Oh,
if we had through our phones and the 

208
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:29,150
ocean and we'd be happy.
It's like,

209
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,220
it's both.
We're super connected,

210
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:33,950
we're super lonely,
we're super stimulated,

211
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:37,130
we're super numb,
we're self expressing and objectifying.

212
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:37,820
It's like,
yeah,

213
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,410
I wouldn't be here without the Internet.
You know what I mean?

214
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:41,270
Like obviously I'm so,
so grateful for it.

215
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,580
Um,
but also it's,

216
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,571
you know,
there's,

217
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:47,270
there,
there may be a happy medium between like

218
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,733
60 minutes talking about like narcissist
the kids and like come on creators or 

219
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:56,070
whatever the fuck youtube conversation 
is where it can't

220
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,960
self examine it at all.
I feel like,

221
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,590
well I'm on my part,
I'm a grown man more or less.

222
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,783
And I've recently pretty much quit using
social media because it's honestly too 

223
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,320
much for me,
for me,

224
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,423
like,
uh,

225
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,150
like even me for for a long day,
I had like a quota for myself for,

226
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,993
I was like,
I need to post every day on twitter 

227
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,154
once.
Yeah.

228
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,040
Cause in a way it's like if I don't 
tweet,

229
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:20,874
do I exist still?
Like am I still in the minds of these 

230
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,660
people?
And I found by the way,

231
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,010
that the answer is very much,
yes,

232
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:26,844
you still do exist if you don't tweet.
But like there was just a really 

233
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,133
unhealthy interaction I had with it.
Like checking it first thing in the 

234
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,650
morning.
I had that too.

235
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,280
I started to sitting down and he would 
be on my phone.

236
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,660
I was like,
this is fucked up.

237
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,043
This is totally,
because you don't really get a lot of 

238
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:45,010
time out of that.
You sit down at what do you mean?

239
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,160
What does that buy you?
Like 30 seconds,

240
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:48,780
30,
40 minutes at most,

241
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,020
right.
That's a edition.

242
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,990
We'll get into that.
Um,

243
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,810
but yeah,
I,

244
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:55,644
I,
uh,

245
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,603
but that,
that is part of what the mood is hoping 

246
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:58,344
to get at is that like,
it isn't like sit down to pee and you 

247
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:00,954
use your phone for that.
So you would just open twitter really 

248
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:05,820
fast while you were on the John.
Yeah.

249
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,150
And if it's cold,
I'll piss through the space and the,

250
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,640
the seat in the bowl and all over my 
pants.

251
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,440
It's nothing happens.
Does that happen to you still?

252
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:19,050
They step in when I was a kid and I 
would have like a morning wood and like,

253
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,810
cause your Dick points down into the 
bowl.

254
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,830
Yeah,
definitely.

255
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,300
But you're still able to pay through the
whole soft.

256
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,163
Yeah,
I was just kidding.

257
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,931
Uh,
so,

258
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:28,560
uh,
yeah.

259
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,600
Um,
I was trying to explore that.

260
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

261
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,301
No,
no,

262
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:31,771
no,
no.

263
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:32,730
I'm just like,
totally kidding.

264
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,030
I just made up a really specific joke 
that's never happened.

265
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,640
You've never paid through the crack when
you were a kid.

266
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,163
All right,
let's get on.

267
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,310
Let's get it.
Let's get off.

268
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,250
I tried to be vulnerable with you.
But yeah,

269
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,110
I think like people look at me,
I'm like,

270
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:46,944
man,
I'm so glad I'm not an eighth grade he 

271
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,440
morning,
I'm so glad I'm not so awkward on,

272
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,300
I don't have to deal with social media.
And I'm like,

273
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,163
you're the worst people in social media 
or 30 year olds and young people in 

274
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:57,420
their late twenties like from talking 
with the kids,

275
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,403
the kids have the best chance of being 
shell on it cause they like actually 

276
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:03,840
have a little bit of self awareness and 
kind of have grown up with it.

277
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,750
It's the 30 year olds that pretend like 
they're not,

278
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,010
you know,
addicted to it and becoming a suit.

279
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,013
I just like,
I can't believe what my friends look 

280
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:12,160
like online.
I came,

281
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,433
there was so many people that I,
I don't mind in real life and I hate 

282
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,050
interesting hate them and there's never 
the opposite.

283
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:22,500
There's never any like what is it that 
they do online that makes you hate them?

284
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,630
It just so transparent,
right?

285
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:27,720
What everyone's doing,
things trying to look like peachy and or

286
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,330
no,
trying to look pg or trying to or trying

287
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:33,980
to be ironically peachy or you know like
uh,

288
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,350
I mean humblebrag is the word of the 
21st century.

289
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,283
I heard you say something that I really 
liked is something that's been ringing 

290
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:41,184
with me.
It was like if you ironically hate 

291
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:46,770
something,
it's not really better than like if you,

292
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:49,950
ironically if you're self aware of doing
something that you'd have like,

293
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,390
yeah,
it's not really different.

294
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,051
Yeah.
No everyone,

295
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:54,130
like you see that on a lot of people 
being

296
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,360
like clickbaiting ironically,
but it's like,

297
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,270
well you still know you're still doing 
that.

298
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,430
It's like,
and I did that when I was 16 and 70.

299
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:02,410
It was like by my merge,
I'm a sellout.

300
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,310
It's like that.
No,

301
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,443
you're still a fucking stuff.
Like it doesn't being self aware of 

302
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:10,711
saves you nothing the most.
And it's like the ironic shit,

303
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:11,803
the most ironic shit online is like old 
spice commercials and Geico commercials 

304
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,190
where they're going on and being like,
this is a Geico commercial wink.

305
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:19,330
And it's like,
fuck you.

306
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,403
There's like dead pool,
it's like a $200 million movie winking 

307
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:22,900
at you.
And it's like,

308
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,520
is that cool?
I don't know what I mean,

309
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,010
I'm just saying like this sort of like 
surrealist,

310
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,990
cool,
crazy adult swim.

311
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,380
Like,
uh,

312
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,120
aesthetic has been totally co opted by,
like all state,

313
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,470
all state.
But you know what I'm saying?

314
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,950
I feel like it's a,
I dunno,

315
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,010
it just feels to me.
Let me ask you,

316
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,844
how does making a movie compare to your 
other creative endeavors that you've 

317
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,180
done so far?
It was good,

318
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,023
man.
I was just desperate to work with other 

319
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:51,160
people.
I was like,

320
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,470
um,
you know,

321
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:55,000
stand up,
you just look to yourself.

322
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:58,130
And I was so tired of my own head.
I mean,

323
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,070
I was just so tired of my voice and my 
face.

324
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,383
Um,
so I just wanted to work with people 

325
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:04,270
again.
I did theater like growing up and that's

326
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:06,570
what I really love and that's what I,
when I fell in love with ships.

327
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:07,880
So,
um,

328
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,183
yeah,
it was just about working with people 

329
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:12,610
and getting out of my own head.
And that was nice.

330
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:13,444
That's awesome.
Because like trying to explore my own 

331
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:16,084
anxiety by being alone on stage.
How far it's surprisingly ended up 

332
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:20,560
making it worse.

333
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,330
Um,
you'll have problems with anxiety.

334
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,700
Oh yeah.
I also have suffered from that,

335
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:25,534
but I'm curious,
have you found something that's helped 

336
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:27,604
you?
How long have you been suffering from 

337
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:29,734
anxiety?
Longer in hindsight than I thought when 

338
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:34,690
I was in high school,
Sophomore year I was in the hall in,

339
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,610
out of the hospital with stomach 
problems thinking,

340
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,680
uh,
I just like,

341
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:39,514
I did like drank barium thinking I'm 
having all this like most of the poles 

342
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,010
in my intestines and I was just nervous 
shitting my pants every day.

343
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:45,844
It's funny,
I find it interesting that you weren't 

344
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:50,800
aware that it was anxiety.
We're feeling will,

345
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:54,340
it was so constant that I didn't think 
it could have been.

346
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:55,950
It was every day.
Um,

347
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,080
which actually probably should have 
pointed to anxiety,

348
00:13:59,081 --> 00:13:59,561
but,
but,

349
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:01,990
um,
and then it really,

350
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,410
when I was 23,
I had my first panic attack on stage and

351
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,940
that was like,
oh shit.

352
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,710
How did you,
how did the show continued?

353
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,780
It continued.
I've had like,

354
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:14,710
you know,
push through it.

355
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,810
Yeah.
I've had about 10 onstage and shit.

356
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:17,644
What happens in that moment?
You become like very self aware tunnel 

357
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:22,120
vision,
like tunnel vision and then like,

358
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,690
you know,
numb body and then just a total like out

359
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:28,060
of body feeling.
And what's so weird,

360
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,430
it's so weird about it is that it's 
with,

361
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,470
it's,
it's happening within the structure of a

362
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,260
show that is rich enough to but to the 
word,

363
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:36,170
you know what I mean?
So it's like,

364
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,320
I can't even like go,
oh,

365
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,393
I'm feeling like I have to,
I have to like say it ends up like I'm 

366
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:43,534
in groundhog's day and I like,
or like I have a script they have to 

367
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:47,284
keep to,
so I have this inner monologue freaking 

368
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,624
out and then I'm having to perform by 
drowned that you're able to still like 

369
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:57,320
perform the script while having a 
somewhat out of body experience.

370
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,400
Yeah,
it was,

371
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,503
but it was like,
it was like I'd be a little out of 

372
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:03,740
breath.
So I'd be the entire show for 20 minutes

373
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:06,980
would be existing like on like the 
inhale kind of.

374
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,350
Um,
it definitely wasn't my best work.

375
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,203
Hmm.
Um,

376
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,300
you know,
uh,

377
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,980
do you remember for me my anxiety,
I think I was diagnosed with generalized

378
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:16,814
anxiety disorder and I had like a very 
specific moment of like almost breaking 

379
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,060
like a breaking point where it just came
out of nowhere.

380
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:27,830
Did you have a moment like that?
It was actually,

381
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,890
I had a panic attack,
um,

382
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,740
in Providence,
Rhode Island,

383
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,880
which is funny cause like,
you know,

384
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:36,320
I've taught people that went to the 
show.

385
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:37,370
I've heard this now,
don't,

386
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,503
you know,
I don't think my parents were there and 

387
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,840
couldn't tell what was happening.
Providence,

388
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,310
Rhode Island,
it was like a theater,

389
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:45,620
like 3000 people had a panic attack.

390
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,940
It was really bad.
Um,

391
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,150
then went to New York,
had three shows,

392
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:58,050
had a panic attack in the middle show,
went to see the Martian the next day and

393
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,420
got very,
very angry because I,

394
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,263
it,
it wasn't about anxiety and I didn't 

395
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:03,350
know it felt like so perfect for my 
life.

396
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:07,100
Like how is this story about a guy alone
on Mars logged in it,

397
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,400
it felt so true to me.
And then it was just like about how he's

398
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,170
like a good botanists or something.
Movies probably chill.

399
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,004
I was just in a bad place and then I had
a panic attack on the train to DC the 

400
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,753
next day.
Um,

401
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,880
which was another show and I had like,
this was like the first week of a tour,

402
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,390
there was like 45 shows and 50 days and 
that was when I was like,

403
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,520
there's something going on here.
Yeah.

404
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,740
Like this is bad and I can never do this
again.

405
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,410
Um,
that,

406
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,000
that,
that was the worst time of my,

407
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,030
I've had a pretty fortunate life.
That was definitely one of the hardest.

408
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,500
Yeah.
Stretches of my life.

409
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,160
And like how did you kind of get through
it?

410
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:45,410
I mean,
did you find at the time,

411
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:47,570
was it like for me it was almost 
unbearable.

412
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:48,404
Like I couldn't even live,
I was like completely debilitated for 

413
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,970
like six months.
I would say try meditation,

414
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,050
you know,
I haven't meditated for sure.

415
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,943
The problem is there's just a show every
night and there was like very like 

416
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,340
surreal comical things where I'd be like
googling how to deal with stage fright,

417
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,170
you know,
before a show in front of 3000 people.

418
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,540
And the answers would be like,
don't worry,

419
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,374
like if you're pr,
if you're doing this in front of your 

420
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:11,510
class or at town hall,
like people don't really care about what

421
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:11,960
you're saying.

422
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,793
I'm like,
no,

423
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,873
nope.
There's 3000 people that have paid $40 

424
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:18,890
in her have waited like it is.
They do care.

425
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,803
Yeah.
It like really helped me to find out 

426
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:25,300
that like Barbara streisand struggled 
with Dell.

427
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,250
Like I actually really helped too.
It's such a weird thing,

428
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:29,084
like how you almost have to be more of a
fucking psycho to not experience 

429
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:33,560
anxiety.
Exactly.

430
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,570
Like it's,
it's like being the president.

431
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:37,070
Like I dunno how you,
well,

432
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,233
I've long held that you have to be an 
actual sociopath that even want to be 

433
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:42,074
president.
Yeah.

434
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,200
So those guys don't feel like,
I just feel cold blooded.

435
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,700
Yeah.
We got a good one right now.

436
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:47,840
But yeah,
they're usually pretty bad.

437
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,733
Yeah.
He's,

438
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,100
I get the feeling he's

439
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,740
not having much self awareness,
self aware of moments right now.

440
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

441
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,190
No.
Um,

442
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,970
yeah,
my mind,

443
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,710
I know my body's on fire.
Um,

444
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,140
yeah.
Meditation.

445
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,170
What did you do dude?
The thing is like I'm not,

446
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,023
I'm like a somewhat sensitive guy,
but for some reason I never talked to 

447
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,270
anyone about it.
Like I don't,

448
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,153
yeah,
I didn't say I was my biggest mistake 

449
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,000
and that's what fucked me up for long.
And looking back in hindsight,

450
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,320
I was like,
why didn't I,

451
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,930
why was I so private about it?
Cause I thought I was,

452
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,850
I thought I was actually having like a 
psychotic break.

453
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,713
I thought I was almost for sure that I 
was schizophrenia and I was so crushed 

454
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:35,691
by that fact and I felt like I would 
crush my parents by telling them that.

455
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,573
And I felt just like I couldn't talk 
about it at all and I held onto it just 

456
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:42,120
hoping it would go away.

457
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,240
But it never did for me.
I don't know if you felt this,

458
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:47,760
like my worry was,
if I say it,

459
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:49,260
it's real.
You know what I mean?

460
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,210
Like,
if I admit that I'm going through there,

461
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,283
it's,
it's,

462
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,600
I've spoken it and now I'll never stop 
thinking about it.

463
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,650
And it is for anyone worried about this.
It is the exact opposite.

464
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,260
It's like speaking,
it is the salvation.

465
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:02,094
So that's what helped me is when I 
finally talked to them about it because 

466
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:06,990
you,
it's just like,

467
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,853
it's like stand up.
It's just you and your head talking to 

468
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:10,104
yourself and it makes everything so much
worse because when you've talked to 

469
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,920
somebody about it,
first of all,

470
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:17,850
it's really a very,
very literal getting it out.

471
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,170
But then people can talk to and be like,
look,

472
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,053
you're not fucking,
you're not schizophrenia and you're not 

473
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,990
dying.
It's just anxiety.

474
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,033
Like the things that I hoped for myself 
but wouldn't believe people were 

475
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:32,310
confirming for me,
that was the beginning of,

476
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,990
of,
of healing.

477
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,350
But I think the thing that really 
changed for me was having a sick,

478
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,110
like a significant other and,
and my wife,

479
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,430
right?
Someone that really,

480
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,264
like I felt comfortable talking about it
and being myself and knowing that cause 

481
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:51,740
a lot of the anxiety that I had was very
much like social and a lot of ways.

482
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,510
Yeah,
yeah.

483
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,011
Right.
Yeah,

484
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:55,380
of course.
So a lot of that was alleviated when you

485
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:58,110
find someone that like you think doesn't
care.

486
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,153
Yeah.
And you're alone in it together or 

487
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:01,614
whatever,
and then you can hate the world army of 

488
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:03,480
two or something.
Yeah.

489
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:05,310
Yeah.
You're going to get said.

490
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,990
Yeah.
That's beautiful.

491
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,310
Yeah.
I um,

492
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,650
I never took medicine though,
but frankly I wish I did.

493
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,360
Yeah.
I think it would've helped a lot.

494
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,560
I almost took Beta blockers for 
performance when I felt like I was going

495
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,000
to Beta blockers.
We've talked about that here.

496
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,320
I don't know what the Fuck Beta 
blockers,

497
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:20,154
I don't know anything and it sounds like
it's like a nineties board game or 

498
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:22,831
something.
Yeah.

499
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,410
But I really feel like doing it.
Um,

500
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,360
but yeah,
man,

501
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:30,360
it's like the sort of my thing was like,
you know,

502
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,420
if I'm being truly honest with myself,
it's like the two sides of the same coin

503
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,743
that like I,
by speaking it out loud and seeing that 

504
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:39,930
other people were going through it and 
it ended,

505
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:43,050
it wasn't unique to my experience of 
being because I just thought like,

506
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,913
oh it's,
this is happening to me because I'm 

507
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,540
living an insane life in a very specific
circumstance.

508
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,374
You know

509
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,650
what I spoke and I realize like it's the
two things.

510
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,410
It was the thing I was most terrified of
and the thing that actually saved me,

511
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:55,990
which is like I'm not unique and I'm not
alone.

512
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,380
You know,
I think I was maybe deep down wanting it

513
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,990
to be singular because you know,
I've just,

514
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:02,824
you know,
I want to have a very singular 

515
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:06,640
experience when I'm going through.
You can understand.

516
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,593
Right?
I think that that sort of mindset is 

517
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:09,724
common too.
Anxious people and an idea of of it is 

518
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:14,404
so visceral.
I sort of describe it like having 

519
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,200
anxiety feels like,
um,

520
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,770
like I'm riding a bull,
like my bull is a nurse,

521
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,230
my nervous system and I just have to 
hold onto it.

522
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,663
And then like,
being in the world feels like everyone 

523
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:30,040
else's,
a,

524
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,210
an equestrian,
you know what I mean?

525
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:33,820
Just like perfectly in sync with their 
own nervous system.

526
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,500
And it just,
it just isn't true.

527
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,393
Totally.
So many silent battles of it and 

528
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:40,840
absolutely for some,
and it's so weird.

529
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,380
Like I,
uh,

530
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,313
I hadn't,
I co I saw a little bit of my special 

531
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,000
that I didn't scenes,
you know,

532
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,883
in,
uh,

533
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,800
make happy the last one in two years and
I saw it and I couldn't,

534
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,080
I would not believe that person was 
nervous.

535
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,960
Yeah.
I wouldn't believe I would think like,

536
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,480
oh,
he's talking about anxiety too,

537
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,800
just,
you know,

538
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,450
if he thinks it's like in and,
and,

539
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,650
and,
but like he's not nervous.

540
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,710
And I was,
I frankly didn't know that it was such a

541
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:10,711
battle for you after the first show.
I saw obed sobbed backstage because,

542
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,670
because like,
I mean,

543
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,140
I slept two hours in the night before.
I was shaking like um,

544
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,290
yeah it uh,
yeah it was,

545
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,850
it was rough.
It was um,

546
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:22,803
it's incredible that even through that 
you can still do shit cause like 

547
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:26,764
thinking back on myself,
I wasn't famous at the time when I was 

548
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:29,910
having my worst anxiety.

549
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,953
I still suffer from it a lot.
But like back in the day I was so like 

550
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,640
even just talking to someone was almost 
like a a bat like a real battle for him.

551
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,483
Yeah.
Going on a date was like the fuck and 

552
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,583
like very much like what the movie is 
that it describes is like these mundane 

553
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:51,270
ordinary things can sometimes be the 
bravest thing you can do it.

554
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:51,821
Right.
Exactly.

555
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:52,654
And that's what the movie was trying to 
do is like portray it very much and it 

556
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,550
works for third year.
I appreciate it.

557
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:58,384
And it was like 13 year old life for a 
13 year old or someone with social 

558
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:03,634
anxiety.
Every tiny moments feel like life and 

559
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:06,214
death and it is,
it's so important to overcome it and 

560
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:09,184
just say,
you know what,

561
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,023
I still have to do this.
And I feel like that is really what 

562
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,520
makes you overcome it.
Yes.

563
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,061
And,
and,

564
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:16,894
and like I just think movies tend to 
over us like push situations into drama 

565
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:25,340
and confrontation that that needs to 
justify it.

566
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,620
I think people are so fucking 
nonconfrontational in real life.

567
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,483
So nonconfrontational like have you ever
like just raised your voice at the guy 

568
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:35,144
in like the grocery store line and then 
your heart is pounding for 40 minutes 

569
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:38,550
afterwards?
Like yeah.

570
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,050
Like you ever seen an argument and 
you're like,

571
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:42,850
Holy Shit.
You know what I mean?

572
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,890
I just think life is very,

573
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,850
the drama of our lives literally plays 
out very small.

574
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,710
But subjectively in personally it's 
very,

575
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:53,270
very big.
So the movie was just trying to be like,

576
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,440
can we show those tiny tiny moments very
successfully?

577
00:23:57,441 --> 00:24:00,030
Like the scene where she's gone to the 
pool party was just like,

578
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,710
I felt that so much.
You know what I mean?

579
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,020
And I think everybody watched you will 
feel it so much.

580
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:07,060
So it definitely,
I love,

581
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,480
I love that so much capturing,
appreciate it.

582
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,590
What part is,
they're just not chill.

583
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,140
And we were trying to also like really 
try to look at kids,

584
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:16,970
not nostalgically,
not like a memory,

585
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:18,280
but just try to see them like,
yeah,

586
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:19,130
yeah.
Aliens.

587
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:22,410
Like what if we just forgot what these 
things meant to us in hindsight,

588
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,980
but just looked at it fresh and it's 
like a pool party is like,

589
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,843
okay.
It's like,

590
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,043
okay,
so forget everything you know about 

591
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:27,660
bombarding.

592
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,930
Forget that it's like a cultural 
standard and realize that it's like,

593
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:30,764
okay.
It's like a bunch of kids whose bodies 

594
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:36,840
are exploding half dressed hole in the 
ground with water.

595
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:37,800
It's like,
wow,

596
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,320
how is this part of our lives?
Like?

597
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:40,154
Yeah.
How is this any pass it like rite of 

598
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,010
passage for kids.
Yeah,

599
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,110
absolutely.
And finally,

600
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:48,420
like you just touched on it,
it doesn't get better as an adult go.

601
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:49,254
No.
Imagine I cannot mind taking off my 

602
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,460
shirt fucking the worst ever.
I'm still like,

603
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,650
I wouldn't do that now.
I would just not do it.

604
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,690
Would you do,
would you go in with a shirt on?

605
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,450
Did you do that when you were a kid?
I would shirt on in the pool.

606
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,010
I'll tell you why.
I was shirt on.

607
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:06,360
I had a giant mole on my back has been 
removed.

608
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,210
You can grab my mom did it by your mom.

609
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,143
It was camp.
She thought it was cancerous cause it 

610
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:16,340
was like this fucking big but that's why
I wish shirt on now.

611
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:19,340
I keep the shirt on because um,
I'm fat.

612
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,840
Hold up.
Wait,

613
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,063
your mother,
your mother removed them all off your 

614
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:24,710
back?
She,

615
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,880
okay.
Maybe I,

616
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,773
I described that weirdly.
She opted for it to be removed with or 

617
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,010
you think I went and that's not what 
happened at all.

618
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:37,710
Yeah.
No.

619
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,630
Okay.
Chill.

620
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,880
But we got that covered.
Okay.

621
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:41,960
That's good.
That's great.

622
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,680
Um,
yeah I would,

623
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,150
the sad shit is I would,
I would always work,

624
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,313
wear my tee shirt in the pool,
but I would like pretend like you mean 

625
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,700
I'm like fall into the pool and be like,
Oh shit,

626
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,800
my shirts that's,
oh,

627
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:55,581
it's rough.
Right.

628
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,620
You know everyone,
even as a kid everyone's like,

629
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:58,580
come on dude.
Yeah.

630
00:25:58,581 --> 00:25:59,570
You really,
really like,

631
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,910
you forget how self aware you are at 
that age.

632
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,310
Like at that age,
you're in on the joke of yourself.

633
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,400
Like you're making fun of each other for
your voice is cracking and shit.

634
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:08,790
Like you know what's going on.
Yeah,

635
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,633
yeah,
yeah.

636
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,470
It's brutal.
Sure.

637
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:15,080
On Man.
I've seen I fully clad,

638
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:17,990
I mean shoes and everything.
I've seen that before.

639
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,800
That's pretty well some stuff.
Cardio Wifi.

640
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,180
Yeah.
Damn.

641
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,650
So would you share it on these that you 
insured on if you went to a pool party?

642
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,890
I don't pool.
Yeah.

643
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

644
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,530
I'm an endorsement.
Most definitely.

645
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,510
Do you have it?
Are you,

646
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,740
would you camp,
do you do any outdoor activities?

647
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:40,550
Would you play video games?
Like what am I outside people camp.

648
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,553
Yeah.
People.

649
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,980
Yeah,
there's fuckers out there.

650
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,023
They're all granola.
There's people out there that do stuff 

651
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:46,920
and I'm,
and I'm genuinely jealous.

652
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:48,300
I say when I meet somebody,
I'm like,

653
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,650
you're the kind of guy that does stuff,
aren't you?

654
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,020
I know.
You know what I mean?

655
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,010
To me that's like,
yeah,

656
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:57,930
if I just like ate the right stuff and 
went hiking and things,

657
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:00,060
I'd be happy.
But can you imagine going hiking?

658
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,430
No.
Can you imagine it ever went to Brian?

659
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,590
I've never went.
Never.

660
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,970
I just,
everyone hikes here.

661
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,470
I've never been,
they seem so happy.

662
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:10,290
They're out there dead behind the eyes.
They're lying about it.

663
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,163
No,
no way.

664
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,580
Dan,
are you a high,

665
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,680
I mean,
I know that like,

666
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,250
like Dan and Ian are very much people 
that do stuff and I go,

667
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:18,990
who are you?
Well you meet these people.

668
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:20,830
They're like,
that was Dan.

669
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:22,920
Sorry Dan,
do go hiking.

670
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,150
No,
I mean when uh,

671
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,070
when a girlfriend a few years ago,
she would force me to all the time.

672
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:30,360
But that's not,
that doesn't really count.

673
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,750
You didn't like it,
you know,

674
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,663
it was that the main problem in the 
relationship that she wanted to hike in 

675
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:37,500
more ways than walk and hike.

676
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,850
Yeah,
exactly.

677
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:40,420
I'm going to dump her.
Yeah.

678
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,120
All right.
Yeah.

679
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,370
I like those people.
Are you jealous people that do stuff?

680
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,090
Cause I'm,
I know.

681
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,740
Oh,
they're always planning stuff.

682
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:48,690
They're going to like art exhibits.
Yeah.

683
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:52,290
They're also liking thrilled when they 
find a bag of like dried cranberries.

684
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,520
Like,
I don't want to live that life.

685
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,860
Find a bag of drugs.
They're all like,

686
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,880
oh,
you know what I mean?

687
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,610
I didn't want to eat like Eggo waffles 
and drink red bull.

688
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,570
I'm saying what,
what are you,

689
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,610
what's your,
what's your main hobby?

690
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,920
You probably work a lot.
No,

691
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,000
no,
I have a true,

692
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:08,280
true lazy streak.
Like truly,

693
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,240
um,
I like,

694
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,103
we'll sit around for a long,
long time and then like have a burst of 

695
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,523
doing something.
And so what do you do when you're at 

696
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:16,170
home?
Uh,

697
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:17,610
homeless men,
homeless men.

698
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:19,470
I've got dogs,
I've got the old friends.

699
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,610
Okay.
I,

700
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:22,320
uh,
kiss my dogs,

701
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:23,600
walk,
my girlfriend kiss.

702
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,680
I uh,
I um,

703
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,380
that's like a 1930s joke.
That was good.

704
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,590
Um,
I,

705
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:34,650
uh,
I've watched a lot of,

706
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,920
I went onto,
I know I watch a lot of stuff.

707
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,550
This is my problem.
I'm home all day and I don't know what I

708
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:42,840
do.
Yeah.

709
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,040
Yeah.
I don't know.

710
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,420
I don't know if that's what you're 
getting at.

711
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,723
I'll spend,
I'll be at home all fucking day and at 

712
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:50,760
the end of the day I'll be like,
I did,

713
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,773
I don't even,
I didn't even like turn on a show and 

714
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:54,961
watch a show.
Like,

715
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:56,850
at least I would be able to say I did 
that,

716
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,983
but I don't know what I do.
I'll watch like videos of like 10 year 

717
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:04,851
olds doing like Yankee candle halls.
What like 10 year olds?

718
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,060
Like they,
they,

719
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,410
there's a lot of Yankees.
Yeah.

720
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,373
Like 10 year old kids that like 300 
subscribers that like go to Yankee 

721
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:14,880
candle and bring a bunch of candles home
and they're low a hall.

722
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:15,590
A candle.
Yeah,

723
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,081
yeah,
yeah.

724
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:17,140
And they're like,
can I cough this?

725
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,173
It's peppermint.
And they smell like it smells like 

726
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,840
peppermint.
It's the greatest shit ever.

727
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,950
Wow.
Okay.

728
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:24,300
I could tell you,
you're very,

729
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,490
you're home your home's men.
Yeah.

730
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:26,911
Yeah.
No.

731
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:27,331
Yeah.
Yeah.

732
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:28,200
I don't,
um,

733
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,330
you play video games?
I play if I,

734
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,050
I got psvr,
uh,

735
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:34,884
very excited about that.
If there was people I want to make my 

736
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:40,190
movie for Vr,
if there was anything else might move.

737
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:41,680
You could be,
I wish it could be vr.

738
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,410
What does that mean?
You're just one of the kids Kinda,

739
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,311
yeah,
yeah.

740
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:46,144
Know what I'm saying?
The vr actually like inspired the movie 

741
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:50,860
a little bit visually,
like wanting to feel like you're in this

742
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:51,694
thing.
Kind of looking around and like when 

743
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,323
people start making like really cool 
short films and stuff on that and 

744
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:58,450
there's been a few,
it's going to be,

745
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,650
it's incredible.
It's like an,

746
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,633
it's a new medium,
not in the way like television and 

747
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:03,970
movies are different mediums.
It's,

748
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,230
it's a different medium in the way.
Like movies and books are for me,

749
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,400
so I'm very excited about that.
But I've got switch.

750
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,950
I didn't plan Mario tennis aces.
Sweet.

751
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,720
I love the switch.
Yeah,

752
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,330
I just do handheld.
Yeah.

753
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:17,680
I don't fuck with the,
yeah.

754
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,100
Well do you play,
do you play on the TV or no?

755
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,490
See I do all that.

756
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,900
Yeah.
I liked the TV.

757
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,950
Yeah,
we're different,

758
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,330
but I heard it's better.
I heard it.

759
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,860
Right,
exactly.

760
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,500
You're going to have to split hairs.
The differences with like,

761
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm a handheld switch,
man.

762
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,180
You're a,
but it's better graphics on the TV.

763
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,043
Yeah.
Yeah.

764
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,510
It's a TV for fuck sake.
That's right.

765
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,040
As a teen,
I checks out.

766
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,660
All right,
let's go to a quick break.

767
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,553
We will be right back when we get back.
I want to ask you all about like kind 

768
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:45,550
of,
I've got a question.

769
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:47,890
Is the viral video debt,
you know,

770
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,320
let's ask that when we come back.

771
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,920
Thank you too for hymns for sponsoring 
this episode of the h three podcasts.

772
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:57,754
Did you guys know that 66% of men start 
losing their hair by age 35 now I 

773
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:08,670
started using for hymns about I'd say 
two days ago and I don't want to brag or

774
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:09,694
anything,
but not only is my hair looking more 

775
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:11,944
luscious and thicker than ever,
but I'm also feeling particularly 

776
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:18,970
powerful today.
Um,

777
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,163
guys,
it's much easier to keep the hair you 

778
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:25,420
have then to replace the hair you've 
lost.

779
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,590
Have you noticed that hairline receding?
Do you want to do something about it?

780
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,431
Well,
guess what?

781
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,250
Baldness is an option.
Okay.

782
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,580
And you don't have to be that guy any 
longer.

783
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,750
The solution for hims.com
a one stop shop for hair loss,

784
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,660
skincare,
sexual wellness for men.

785
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,700
Ian,
for example,

786
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:47,920
started taking four hymns.
How long ago was it?

787
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:49,840
In?
About 24 hours ago,

788
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,770
24 hours.

789
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,490
I mean,
wow.

790
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,650
Results may vary.
I want to emphasize on that,

791
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:56,620
but as worked out really well for in,
yeah,

792
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,540
fix my hair line.
Change my rate.

793
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,120
Thank you so much Ian.
I'm glad we could help you out.

794
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,083
There is a well known generic equivalent
to name brand prescriptions to help you 

795
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:06,184
keep your hair.
This is not snake oil pills or gas 

796
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:13,060
station counter supplements.
This is prescriptions backed by science.

797
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,430
There's no waiting room,
no awkward doctor visits.

798
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,670
You're going to say the hours by going 
to four hymns dotcom.

799
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,470
It's so easy.
Dan,

800
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,340
what is your opinion of four hymns?
It's done a lot of good for me.

801
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,740
Um,
I you as you,

802
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,823
as you can see,
we are all feeling great and our hair 

803
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,790
is,
I don't want to say super saying,

804
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,810
but I mean we're feeling really good 
about it.

805
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,830
Let's just put it that way.

806
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,100
The products get shipped directly to 
your door.

807
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,303
After you answer a few quick questions,
a doctor reviews it and prescribes you 

808
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:43,724
the medicine.
So here's what you need to do or right 

809
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:46,184
flipping.
Now my listeners get a trial month for 

810
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:51,680
four hymns for just $5 today,
right now while supplies last.

811
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,573
See the website for full details.
This would cost hundreds of fricking 

812
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:59,810
doll hairs that you went to a doctor or 
a pharmacy,

813
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:04,610

816
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,990
Thank you to Felix Gray.
Guys,

817
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:18,824
if you're like me,
you spend a lot of time on the computer 

818
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,640
a lot,
way too much and here's what you need to

819
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:26,474
know.
Those blue lights coming off there are 

820
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,960
going to eff you the frick up.

821
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,890
That's why I recommend Felix Gray 
glasses.

822
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,963
Check this out.
These glasses block out the blue light 

823
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,810
to prevent digital eyestrain,
which can give you a headache,

824
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,793
dry eye,
and really just a whole magnitude of 

825
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:48,560
issues that are just frankly going to 
ruin your whole life.

826
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,870
Yeah,
it's tough out there folks,

827
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,510
and look,
you don't have to look like a no word.

828
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,300
If you're trying to use the computer all
day,

829
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,134
you can look stylish and slick and maybe
somebody will actually look at your 

830
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:02,000
Dick.
I Dunno about touch,

831
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:03,110
but look,
yes,

832
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,233
the rest is up to you to secure.
A lot of us spend hours and hours in 

833
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:10,970
front of the computer staring at screens
and it gets exhausting.

834
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,000
Even if you've never heard of digital 
eyestrain,

835
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,843
chances are you've experienced it.
When I'm on the computer all day I get 

836
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:17,534
headaches.
It sucks because I don't leave the 

837
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:19,790
computer.

838
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,460
I never stopped.
I just sit there with a headache until I

839
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,020
got these glasses.
Beautiful.

840
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:24,854
The designed by Felix gray feel as great
lenses are specifically designed to 

841
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:31,130
filter blue light and eliminate glare 
from the screen,

842
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:33,770
which are the two main culprits behind 
digital eyestrain.

843
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,910
They have blue light filtering 
technology and bedded into the lenses so

844
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:41,960
you're there effectively without the 
telltale yellow tint or color distortion

845
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:42,794
of other blue light filtering glasses.
Felix gray frames are handcrafted from 

846
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:47,504
premium Italian acetate,
the same material used by the biggest 

847
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,350
designer brands in the world,
and they're super stylish.

848
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,213
This is the touring style.
I love it because it makes me look 

849
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:03,260
studious and handsome and sweet.
Assuming guy that's secretly just a nerd

850
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:05,480
that wants to spend 15 hours a day on 
the computer,

851
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,670
but they don't know that because these 
look cool.

852
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,890
No C prescription as necessary.

853
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,813

nonprescription reader and they've just

boy,

914
00:38:22,741 --> 00:38:24,450
go here.
Let me ask you this.

915
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,320
You had your big breaks.
This is a big thing for you,

916
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:29,460
right?
Elbows on the table.

917
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,331
Yeah.
I don't know.

918
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:32,550
I have things I'm not very self.
I do this a lot.

919
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:33,384
I know this.
We just talked about anxiety and now 

920
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,260
call him on your mind.

921
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,390
Now that's hard.
Horrible.

922
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,410
Well,
you know,

923
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,540
I used to say fascinating.
It's a good word,

924
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:42,010
but I lean on it a little bit.
Yeah.

925
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,570
And I got mehmed into the fucking 
ground.

926
00:38:44,571 --> 00:38:45,404
That's incredible.
And I watched like late night shows and 

927
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:49,900
I watched people and they say,
I listen to a lot of podcasts.

928
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,500
They say fascinating.
A lot faster pumps.

929
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,690
You can even have it sound bus.
You can tell what rose of listening.

930
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,230
You're like,
I can't get away from it.

931
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,340
You can tell what,
uh,

932
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,413
Bros had been listening to Jordan 
Peterson by how all of a sudden they 

933
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:08,090
start saying presupposition.
That's sort of saying presupposition.

934
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,250
I'm like,
that's cool Bruh.

935
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,960
I know where you got that.
Oh,

936
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:11,900
you love that word.
Yeah.

937
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,350
Oh my God.
Dan,

938
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,530
just a man to come on.
This is not fascinating at all.

939
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,580
Not um,
yeah,

940
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,563
so we,
the presupposition was that you weren't 

941
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:21,554
going to come in here.

942
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,240
This was pre suppose.
Um,

943
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,010
so let me ask you,
you came up,

944
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,490
I'm coming up.
I want the world to know.

945
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,630
I've got to let it show.
Yeah.

946
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:34,920
You got to let it chill.
This is so,

947
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,280
yeah.
I fucked you up.

948
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,370
You came up,
you went viral,

949
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,390
right?
Hell yeah.

950
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:48,190
I feel like back then going viral is 
that a Hashtag Hashtag viral viral,

951
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,053
I became an internet sensation.
You what term I love and please keep 

952
00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:54,880
using it.
And it was true back then.

953
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,390
There was such thing as real.
I felt like it was real viral videos and

954
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:00,070
viral videos.
Yes.

955
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,430
Meant like from nothing.
Yes.

956
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,330
From the depths of,
yeah.

957
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:07,060
It's bullshit of Youtube.
Libyan cannot go viral.

958
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,940
James,
I'm saying I'd love to check it.

959
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,670
You can't go.
That's not virality of virus.

960
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,650
Yeah.
It's like a dude fucked a monkey.

961
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,100
He got aids and from the depths of out 
of nowhere,

962
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,800
aids was born exactly viral.

963
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,851
But it's like,
oh,

964
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:23,020
I got a cold.
It's like,

965
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,760
well the has been around.
That's not,

966
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,560
you know what?
That's a weird analogy.

967
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,900
It's a weird analogy,
but maybe,

968
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,753
you know what I mean?
It's more like you have 8 million 

969
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:33,514
subscribers.
Most of your subscribers saw your 

970
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:37,000
fucking thing.
It didn't go viral.

971
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:37,780
Yeah.
You just,

972
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,530
yeah,
exactly.

973
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,650
It's like,
I like,

974
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,713
my question is do viral videos still 
exists because I don't see that 

975
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:44,800
happening anymore.
They do.

976
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,020
They do.
I don't think like,

977
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,020
yeah,
I don't think I would would've worked.

978
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:50,883
No,
I don't think I would have been 

979
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:52,180
discovered.
It's a bummer.

980
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:53,530
I don't like,
why is that?

981
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,680
We do think cause youtube turned into a 
fucking studio and a and the network and

982
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,770
you go to the trending page and it's 
fucking late night,

983
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,160
late night clips,
movie trailers and music videos.

984
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:07,150
It's like fuck.
Like,

985
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,650
you know what I mean?
Like when we started,

986
00:41:08,651 --> 00:41:10,750
it was like this was going to be the 
people's medium.

987
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:13,300
It was like cool and different and now 
it's just like,

988
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,680
I don't know why they do.
I really,

989
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,320
I don't understand why they do that.
I don't either.

990
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:18,011
It's like,
dude,

991
00:41:18,011 --> 00:41:18,844
just don't put that shit there.
They don't need the fucking views and 

992
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:23,770
the best they do is like support their 
creators.

993
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:26,850
But are they supporting like no,
the,

994
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,783
the little creators,
the ones with a bunch of subscribers 

995
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:33,620
don't need help and I don't the 
specifics.

996
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,040
I know people

997
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,540
are getting fucked over specifically,
but it's like,

998
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:36,374
yeah,
it's kind of like the class of 2006 to 

999
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:42,640
11 rows or whatever and like,
or you know,

1000
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,600
I think it's hard to become anything 
now.

1001
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,570
I think like the established,
it's really hard to break through.

1002
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,433
Yeah,
and the only people that I see breaking 

1003
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:55,001
through now are basically people who are
producing.

1004
00:41:56,511 --> 00:42:01,511
Just really just really the worst stuff 
that's very easily consumable.

1005
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:04,814
That's very clickable.
I think the thumbnail and the title are 

1006
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:09,230
so important.
Now let's walk through that.

1007
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:10,064
It's really,
that's like people start there and then 

1008
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,400
work backwards.
Money.

1009
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:14,234
Yeah.
Cause I remember I all my videos are 

1010
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:19,750
posted like lowercase,
just the title of the song you mean?

1011
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:23,990
And I remember like even me later in the
clips I had to do big capital Bo Burnham

1012
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:24,980
hd,
whatever the fuck.

1013
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,220
Um,
but uh,

1014
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,270
that's not,
but like bill worst bill wirtz,

1015
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:32,060
the guy that did the history of 
[inaudible] is the one exception.

1016
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,060
I think there are some others.
I'm sure there are.

1017
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:35,661
And,
and,

1018
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:37,850
and again,
it's not,

1019
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,730
it's not that,
I wouldn't say it's not the kids,

1020
00:42:40,731 --> 00:42:44,060
the specific people posting themselves 
that aren't a value.

1021
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,120
It's just I think the value system or 
whatever that's like,

1022
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,580
that you're taught to,
you know,

1023
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,060
I don't think it encourages people to be
creative like it used to.

1024
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,570
Right.
Or got out of the way.

1025
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,290
It's like,
I dunno.

1026
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,490
It's crazy.
Well,

1027
00:42:59,491 --> 00:43:00,324
a lot.
I don't think it was all going to turn 

1028
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,180
into blogging.
Yeah.

1029
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,250
And like,
that's cool if you've logged,

1030
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,000
but like even musicians,
like on youtube,

1031
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,500
they're like little indie musicians 
start their music video with like,

1032
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,240
hey guys,
this is my music video.

1033
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:13,130
I hope you check it out.
And then it cuts and I'm like,

1034
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:13,964
whoa.
I think the problem is that Youtube's 

1035
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:16,544
algorithm favors lots like daily or even
more than daily uploads of basically to 

1036
00:43:24,891 --> 00:43:25,724
succeed on Youtube in this environment 
you have to post like every day and fan 

1037
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:30,440
engagement.

1038
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,260
Yeah,
and that is kind of like crazy terms.

1039
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:33,094
That's just like what's on top right now
because it's what youtube is selected 

1040
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,640
probably inadvertently to dominate.
Right.

1041
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,760
And it's not that,
it's not that there shouldn't be that.

1042
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,480
I mean there are people yourself 
included who are very good at commentary

1043
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:48,314
who should be posting a lot,
but that should be one part of an 

1044
00:43:51,471 --> 00:43:52,304
ecosystem.
I'm saying in theory this thing is just 

1045
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:55,730
a blank medium,
right?

1046
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:57,980
Where anything can post where anything 
can.

1047
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,430
I would just,
I just remembered in 2006 being like,

1048
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,293
Oh man,
I wonder what youtube is going to be 

1049
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:04,484
like in 10 years.
It's going to be like all the Oscar 

1050
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:06,890
winning shorts are,
I mean,

1051
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:07,724
who cares?
It doesn't matter if it's not the 

1052
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,133
Oscars,
but I'm just saying it's going be like 

1053
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:13,610
people are going to be uploading,
you know,

1054
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,680
like what,
when I made my special,

1055
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:16,603
I made this big thing of like,
I'm going to post it for free on 

1056
00:44:19,371 --> 00:44:20,240
youtube,
you know,

1057
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,074
and then give it to Netflix.
But I took way less of a pay so I could 

1058
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:26,960
post referring on Youtube and I posted 
it for free on youtube.

1059
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:29,420
But I realized like the environment had 
changed so much that like,

1060
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,010
uh,
no one even thought I was posting.

1061
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,040
They just thought it was like a rip

1062
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,150
from Netflix.
And I was like,

1063
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,243
Oh man,
this place doesn't even exist for that 

1064
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:36,180
anymore.
Really?

1065
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,220
That's true.
And then you see fucking,

1066
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,121
I mean,
I don't know.

1067
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:40,800
So I'm sure there's some really good 
stuff.

1068
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,020
I don't want to be shitting on people.
I'm like,

1069
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,480
these are things I struggle with.
These are pressures,

1070
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,770
pressures,
I feel.

1071
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,200
Um,
but it's like,

1072
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:50,491
I don't know,
around town,

1073
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:52,020
I see billboards for youtube red.
And I'm like,

1074
00:44:52,021 --> 00:44:54,420
it looks like a Disney channel.
Like isn't this place the wild west?

1075
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:55,254
Isn't this like totally free?
Why are we imposing like wire and it 

1076
00:44:58,531 --> 00:44:59,364
feels like creators themselves are 
inviting like the archaic standards of 

1077
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:05,784
Hollywood to themselves.
It's like you can be so much freer than 

1078
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:09,960
this,
I would think.

1079
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:11,760
Why?
Why you making?

1080
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,790
Do you know what I mean?
I don't think that,

1081
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,813
well,
if you look at someone like filthy 

1082
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:16,494
frank,
I don't know if here that know who that 

1083
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,533
he was someone who kind of embodied what
you're talking about where he was very 

1084
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:21,960
much his own man.

1085
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,460
He very much did his own thing,
didn't conform to any anything.

1086
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:29,100
It was just totally fucking nuts and 
everybody loved it.

1087
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,520
But the problem was that he was always 
being demonetized.

1088
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,354
Youtube was always fucking with his 
videos and in a way that didn't really 

1089
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:37,480
make it sustainable.
I used to love shoe.

1090
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,590
Nice.
Who like use your nice drink glue.

1091
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,633
It was hold a,
what did you say to shoot and I says 

1092
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,320
he's a legend.
Legend.

1093
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:47,970
He called Isla and Israeli con once and 
they wanted to kill her or something.

1094
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:49,400
But I was like,
oh nice.

1095
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,590
We still had in my head,
I still,

1096
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,900
me and my girlfriend,
we always said thank yeah that,

1097
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,880
oh he's the greatest isn't it?
But it just like,

1098
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,103
yeah,
but you and I says he's not killing it 

1099
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:01,950
anymore.
Well he's killing,

1100
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,180
well he is living,
he's killed but not,

1101
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,940
but like I'm just saying it should be 
weirder.

1102
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,783
Right.
I that that that's all I just mean it 

1103
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:11,394
should be like,
but I'm glad he said bell works because 

1104
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:15,960
that does kind of our works and and,
and you know what?

1105
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,780
I know that there's like hundreds of 
them,

1106
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,170
thousands of the just the system isn't 
in place too.

1107
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:23,004
I'm saying like what I'm saying really 
is not going after the people making 

1108
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:32,040
stuff and even the people making stuff 
would be so much better if the,

1109
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:35,160
if the medium itself was encouraging 
actual creative expression.

1110
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:38,250
I wish they had a department or some 
kind of dedication to doing that.

1111
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:39,600
But as far as I'm aware,
they're just,

1112
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:41,570
they don't,
and it's value.

1113
00:46:41,571 --> 00:46:42,404
Why are a bunch of NBC executives like 
the people that work at youtube or like 

1114
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:47,160
a bunch of fucking dusty.
Yeah.

1115
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:48,480
I shouldn't be saying this shit,
but whatever,

1116
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,070
whatever.
I'm friends with them.

1117
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:50,611
They know,
they know.

1118
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:51,444
We all hate him.
All right.

1119
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,430
I live with that.
Yeah.

1120
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,960
It's like when you walk into Youtube 
headquarters and you're like,

1121
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:58,180
is this the m and m store?
Where the fuck Emma me,

1122
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,860
me and it's like,
I don't know.

1123
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,880
The Internet to me is like dirty and 
weird and crazy and like so human.

1124
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:08,370
And if you did it just scratch past the 
surface,

1125
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:09,204
you fall in that side.
Part of the problem that's happening is 

1126
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:11,214
that like with net neutrality and all,
all this stuff going on is that people 

1127
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,310
don't want the Internet to be that 
dirty,

1128
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:19,590
crusty place anymore.
They want it to be,

1129
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:20,424
you know,
buttoned up and they want it to be 

1130
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:25,140
predictable and they want it to be a not
just another thing.

1131
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,910
Yeah.
I mean that's,

1132
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,770
that's where the movement is,
is going.

1133
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,990
Yeah.
It's,

1134
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,823
it's,
it's hard because I'm on both sides a 

1135
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:33,094
little bit.
Cause I also look at the Internet and 

1136
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:34,714
don't go like the only problem with the 
Internet isn't that it needs to be 

1137
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,350
freer.
You know what I mean?

1138
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:38,920
There,
I mean,

1139
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,500
there is also crazy,
you know,

1140
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:42,363
I don't know if any of us should be able
to watch like people blow their heads 

1141
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:44,831
off,
you know what I mean?

1142
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:46,510
And stuff like I don't know if but,
but,

1143
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,790
or worse.
Yeah.

1144
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,440
Blow,
they're much,

1145
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,470
much worse things on the Internet.
Oh yeah,

1146
00:47:52,471 --> 00:47:53,304
yeah,
yeah.

1147
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,050
I got you.
The snakes.

1148
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,900
Yes.
And you know what I'm talking about.

1149
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:00,663
Yeah.

1150
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,343
Yeah.
Yeah.

1151
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,410
Well what,
what do you think of,

1152
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:08,590
um,
when you came up on youtube,

1153
00:48:08,591 --> 00:48:12,040
there wasn't such a notion as,
as Internet celebrity or youtube.

1154
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:12,580
So,
no,

1155
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,400
when there wasn't a standard,
there wasn't like a thing you should be,

1156
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,110
there wasn't like a,
uh,

1157
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:18,663
there wasn't a format,
so it was just like people just doing 

1158
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:23,890
random shit,
unpolished,

1159
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:25,810
random shit,
which is cool,

1160
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:27,130
you know,
as opposed to like,

1161
00:48:27,131 --> 00:48:28,210
if you want to,
you know,

1162
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,193
I,
I dunno,

1163
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,840
what do you like,
what do you think?

1164
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,270
The old dude.
But no,

1165
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,370
but I am I,
yeah,

1166
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,130
but I am,
I am across the old due to the,

1167
00:48:35,131 --> 00:48:37,330
I mean I was in 2006 right when this 
thing started,

1168
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,890
but it's because I care about it so much
and I want,

1169
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:42,724
you know,
young people that are taking risks and 

1170
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:47,670
making interesting things to like have a
s and it's,

1171
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:48,603
I say this because I care about it 
because like every other medium has no 

1172
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:54,010
fucking chance of being cool.

1173
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:54,880
Really like,
yeah,

1174
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:55,743
this is like the first like real medium 
where like everyone can actually access 

1175
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:05,410
it and like the viral,
even the idea of viral is,

1176
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:06,280
is uh,
is uh,

1177
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,173
is a problem cause it,
cause it immediately puts the idea that 

1178
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,640
the only things worthy are the ones that
are,

1179
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,240
that are um,
being seen like a million times.

1180
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:17,074
You've got to find really cool channels 
with like 3000 views where it's some 

1181
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,170
person giving advice or some person 
teaching piano and like,

1182
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,013
you know,
well originally that's why youtube was 

1183
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:25,594
all about was just a dude who wanted to 
make shit and share it with like their 

1184
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:31,060
friends.
I mean,

1185
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,640
that's why people made videos and the 
early days before you got paid for it.

1186
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,510
But now it's like,
I think 95% of kids,

1187
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,760
if you ask them what's their dream job 
is to be a youtuber.

1188
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,860
Yeah.
I find that pretty strange,

1189
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:45,883
Huh?

1190
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,980
When I was a kid,
people want it to be astronauts.

1191
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,773
Will you tubers weird?
Cause it feels like it's like movie or 

1192
00:49:52,151 --> 00:49:53,470
no,
I guess that would just be like moving,

1193
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,693
but youtube or it's weird that when you 
say youtube or that should have no 

1194
00:49:56,711 --> 00:49:57,580
meaning,
right.

1195
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:02,140
That should actually be like something 
less diverse amount should be writers.

1196
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:02,531
So it was like,
oh,

1197
00:50:02,531 --> 00:50:04,420
what do you want to write?
But when you say youtube or it's like,

1198
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,140
oh,
that means like Hawkeye image.

1199
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,420
Hey,
like this for that.

1200
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,390
You know that that's very true.
But I don't think that's true,

1201
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,480
but I don't think it actually is true.
It just,

1202
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,553
um,
I do think will be your neighbors that 

1203
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:16,750
are getting attention.
Yeah.

1204
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,100
Yeah.
That is what they mean.

1205
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:19,983
Yeah.

1206
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:23,650
No,
we're all fucking losers.

1207
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,900
I feel like that all the time.
But I know what you mean.

1208
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,800
I love Youtube.
I love so of what it was.

1209
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:32,150
Yeah.
I mean what it is and like I get,

1210
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,070
I watch it.
I like it.

1211
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:34,904
So I'm saying if kids are happy and 
everyone's happy doing this shit and 

1212
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:38,660
people are happy watching it,
that's like totally cool.

1213
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,330
Um,
and,

1214
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,333
and I need to emphasize it like the real
thing I'm pissed about is not that 

1215
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:47,623
popular.
Youtube creators are taking this space 

1216
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:51,060
from these kids.
The real thing are the movie studios,

1217
00:50:51,061 --> 00:50:53,600
the movie trailers,
the tonight show clips that like that is

1218
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:55,730
the most infuriating thing when you see 
like,

1219
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:58,830
um,
I thought that uh,

1220
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,890
Shane Dawson,
Tana con thing was awesome.

1221
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:06,270
It was so cool that that was incredible.
And like what an incredible thing to do.

1222
00:51:06,741 --> 00:51:10,010
Like form breaking any,
it was so good.

1223
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,050
Like I was blown away and it was,
it was part and,

1224
00:51:13,051 --> 00:51:16,640
and because of like Shane's personal 
relationship with his odd,

1225
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:17,503
it was that much more meaningful.
So it's like a great like version of 

1226
00:51:19,611 --> 00:51:21,230
that,
like a Louis throw weird version.

1227
00:51:21,231 --> 00:51:22,350
So that was awesome.
Yeah.

1228
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,380
So I know people are doing that.
I just want to be like,

1229
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,833
you know,
like I dunno like Kevin Hart doing like 

1230
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,570
vanity fairs and you know,
most viral questions,

1231
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:33,404
whatever.
You know what I mean?

1232
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:36,770
It's tough and all the,
no hate to any specific people.

1233
00:51:36,771 --> 00:51:38,990
I'm just saying like,
I know I can't believe it.

1234
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:40,070
We're,
I can't believe it.

1235
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:40,904
Like they do it.
These people sit in a room and they go 

1236
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,330
like,
how can we make something viral?

1237
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:45,403
And they make it and it goes viral 
because they called it viral in their 

1238
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:50,120
headline.
Why don't you like he said,

1239
00:51:50,121 --> 00:51:51,680
I don't think that means anything 
anymore.

1240
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,650
Like viral.
And it was just back in the day,

1241
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:56,700
it was like there's a viral video,
Yodel bowl,

1242
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:58,910
and it was,
it was a double rainbow.

1243
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,490
You know what I mean?
Like that's a viral video.

1244
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,990
It's a guy fucking tripping balls over a
cup.

1245
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:07,540
I mean that's,
you know,

1246
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,423
I don't think he's tripping balls.
I think he's just deeply that that guy 

1247
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,190
was a trip to the ball.
Is that right?

1248
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:17,510
I personally think,
and this is a time time old who goes the

1249
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:20,840
dynamite boom,
probably the best of all time,

1250
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:25,310
one of the best of all time.
And like it's similar with the movie,

1251
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:28,130
which is like cringe means a lot to me.
You know what I mean?

1252
00:52:28,131 --> 00:52:30,850
Like,
and there's some like I love like,

1253
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,740
and like our cringe and that all that 
stuff is,

1254
00:52:33,741 --> 00:52:34,574
it gets a little dark.
I don't know why the cringe communities 

1255
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:40,450
sometimes can be very mean,
but I like all the videos but I,

1256
00:52:40,451 --> 00:52:42,470
I re they're like deeply beautiful to 
me.

1257
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:46,100
They're deeply vulnerable and wonderful 
and meaningful.

1258
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:46,963
Tristan,
I'm saying like some people would watch 

1259
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:50,240
the,
that weird hot dog video,

1260
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:51,074
the guy blending the things and want to 
like tell him to kill himself or 

1261
00:52:52,831 --> 00:52:53,664
whatever.
But I think it's like just so beautiful 

1262
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:55,694
that we have access to people's most 
mortifying moments and I feel for them 

1263
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:01,130
and I think cringing is a form of 
empathy and you know,

1264
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,430
well certainly it is.
You're,

1265
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,950
you're embarrassed for them.
Yeah.

1266
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:05,210
So like,
and it's,

1267
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:07,070
and it's vulnerable and like that boom 
goes the dynamite.

1268
00:53:07,071 --> 00:53:07,904
I think that's,
that is me on stage if I just wasn't as 

1269
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:13,580
good or what an r or not,
you know,

1270
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:16,340
if I was,
that is what it was happening for me.

1271
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:17,174
It's that I could just power through it.
He's like having a panic attack and 

1272
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:22,280
Reggie Miller is looking good.
Reggie Miller is the best shit ever.

1273
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,650
Later he gets the rebound passed it to 
the man.

1274
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,070
Well,
speaking of viral

1275
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,630
videos,
I mean you mentioned,

1276
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,680
you mentioned the hot dog peach.
Ian Found it now first of all,

1277
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,050
this video,
this is a [inaudible] because I guess he

1278
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:38,130
erased it.
It was too,

1279
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,600
uh,
too wild for this world.

1280
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,090
Yeah.
But this has a 200,000

1281
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:43,590
views,
so we are really,

1282
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,410
this guy is kind of has a little bit of 
a fan base.

1283
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

1284
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,460
Wow.
So anyone can make it.

1285
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,450
Yeah.
See everybody.

1286
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,960
It's so funny,
after the conversation we had,

1287
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,790
it's going to act like I want more of 
this,

1288
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:59,700
which is just like,
man,

1289
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:00,930
we need more of this.
Yeah.

1290
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,130
Let's see.
Do you know who were,

1291
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,200
where he,
this guy is?

1292
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,770
He's in his kitchen or I mean like,

1293
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,120
okay,

1294
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,310
I wonder what was the impulse?
This guy had to be like,

1295
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,860
I want to share this.
But that's true.

1296
00:54:21,861 --> 00:54:22,521
What is,
no,

1297
00:54:22,521 --> 00:54:24,110
but that's beautiful,
right Jimmy?

1298
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:26,220
So this guy lives is,
I mean,

1299
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,330
but he's not even taking inventory of 
what's in his house,

1300
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,370
but he's making the video of the,
as the,

1301
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,263
as if this is normal and as if people 
want to learn how to make hot dogs and 

1302
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:35,660
peaches.
I mean,

1303
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,240
but really is in a bathroom.
No,

1304
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:43,040
but this is truly beautiful and so 
deeply sad and funny and tragic.

1305
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:47,870
So we're learning about his life,
seeing all these,

1306
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,823
oh,
so the sausages or just actual fucking 

1307
00:54:50,901 --> 00:54:53,520
hot dogs.
I love that he calls it sausage.

1308
00:54:53,521 --> 00:54:57,530
She's feeling a little bourgeois today,
but sees reaching for something,

1309
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,100
but he wants to teach us.
He,

1310
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,360
yeah,
he wants to share.

1311
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,130
It's beautiful.
As beautiful.

1312
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:05,930
He's like,
you know what?

1313
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:10,080
Basically what it implies is that it 
took me a lot to be able to learn.

1314
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,700
I've learned the skill of cooking these 
hot dogs.

1315
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,500
Yeah.
And I think there's a sausage.

1316
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:17,334
Sorry.
Don't mean to downplay the Karmanos of 

1317
00:55:18,511 --> 00:55:20,520
it and he,
and he's blending peaches.

1318
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:24,330
But basically I found this secret,
this wonderful looking at cooking it.

1319
00:55:24,331 --> 00:55:26,190
I'm sorry.
Oh,

1320
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,180
I miss,
I uh,

1321
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,920
does that,
I don't know if that just a little zap.

1322
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:34,200
Okay.

1323
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,640
What I'm saying it is an event.
I mean,

1324
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:36,810
it's different.
He's like,

1325
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:38,970
I found this new way to do this.
You guys,

1326
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,740
it's,
but it's like,

1327
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,640
I don't,
I can't explain it.

1328
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,610
This means a lot to me.
This is beautiful.

1329
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:47,310
And why have I not seen this?
This is really something.

1330
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,740
Why have I seen this?
That's the real question.

1331
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,790
This is,
this sounds like it's right up your acts

1332
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:54,624
of salsa.

1333
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:56,440
Let me,

1334
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,400
but I'm saying this is a glimpse into a 
life we never would have without this.

1335
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:03,510
Right.
Pray to God.

1336
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:05,040
You never have a glimpse into this life.
Right.

1337
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,110
Um,
but,

1338
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,200
but,
but not that.

1339
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:10,770
Not that we're just seeing it.
We're seeing it through his pov.

1340
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,110
Yes.
And like with his perspective,

1341
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:15,540
with his wants,
it's incredible.

1342
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,051
It's,
to me,

1343
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:19,590
it's so cinematic and increase.
It's like some crazy beautiful,

1344
00:56:19,591 --> 00:56:22,590
like harmony corrine.
Like here,

1345
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:24,460
let me crank the volume.
Actually want to watch this.

1346
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,170
It's eight minutes.
So it's a lot.

1347
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,860
It's a lot.
Yeah.

1348
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:30,190
That makes gimme this cat is,
he gonna throw those dogs in the blender

1349
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:32,770
with the peaches.
Oh my God.

1350
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,390
It's healthy in a way.
He's like,

1351
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,290
listen,
a little protein.

1352
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,250
A little fiber.
Yeah,

1353
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:39,790
it's a balanced meal.
Okay,

1354
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:41,660
let's skip forward it to them.
To the fucking,

1355
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,560
he had one at one point,
washes the thing in the sink,

1356
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:46,810
but the dog,
he watches the dog and you got an,

1357
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,580
you got to rinse the dog's clothes.

1358
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:53,970
Look at the trash and the ground and 
look at,

1359
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,260
he just really tossed that in there in a
way that quite never.

1360
00:56:57,261 --> 00:56:59,360
It's got a little Amarillo going on.
A little.

1361
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,310
Yeah.
Oh,

1362
00:57:01,311 --> 00:57:02,370
why is it,
why is there,

1363
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:06,830
why is there a toilet there?
I don't understand the toilet.

1364
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:10,821
His,
his,

1365
00:57:10,821 --> 00:57:13,420
his accident is also like in placeable.

1366
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:18,640
Really?
Unplaceable so let's cut to the,

1367
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:21,310
uh,
the big moment.

1368
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:23,970
If you're worried,

1369
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,680
this is an exciting for the audience.
Trust me,

1370
00:57:25,681 --> 00:57:27,750
it is.
It's just sad.

1371
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:29,340
See,
now he's living,

1372
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:29,851
he's look,
look,

1373
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:30,510
look,
go.

1374
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,520
Whoa.
That looks like started the fucking,

1375
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,413
he started the wrong,
his post place was just about to burn 

1376
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:36,241
down.
Yeah.

1377
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:39,180
Cause he started the wrong,
because he was overreaching.

1378
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:41,580
He probably hasn't done this before.
Oh,

1379
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:43,500
you think this is a new recipe?
But he's,

1380
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:48,650
nobody's trying to act like he's didn't 
Tostito's man,

1381
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:52,050
I've noticed.
Oh yeah.

1382
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:52,884
It's brand loyal.

1383
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,890
Just saying,
but wouldn't the world be a better place

1384
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,860
if we watched this with love?
Am I insane?

1385
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,110
No,
you're not at saying,

1386
00:58:04,111 --> 00:58:05,220
I mean,
I think people do,

1387
00:58:05,221 --> 00:58:06,054
but also people are too.
You have to have a certain level of 

1388
00:58:08,161 --> 00:58:10,710
maturity to be like,
I love this guy and not be like,

1389
00:58:10,711 --> 00:58:12,690
this guy's a fucking loser.
Yeah.

1390
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:13,583
I mean,
I think most people probably over the 

1391
00:58:15,811 --> 00:58:20,811
age of 20 or like having sympathy or 
repulsed in just whatever.

1392
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,620
Yeah.
Listen,

1393
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:24,211
don't want,
well,

1394
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:25,710
let's go.
Let's get to the fireworks.

1395
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,980
Yup.
Let's get them.

1396
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,230
Let's get to,
I'm trying it,

1397
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,340
which is that towards the end

1398
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:33,280
we're looking at,
oh my God,

1399
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,280
he's nervous.
He's like,

1400
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:40,143
ah,
you did double the cups up if you 

1401
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:43,900
notice.
So he,

1402
00:58:43,901 --> 00:58:45,040
uh,
he's uh,

1403
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:47,620
by you hip hop artist,
right?

1404
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:49,121
Well,
yeah,

1405
00:58:49,121 --> 00:58:51,670
he doubled up.
I think he just cherishes the content so

1406
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:52,270
much,
you know,

1407
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,130
link.
He does not lose the drop.

1408
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,310
So am I correct me if I'm wrong?
He didn't blend the dogs.

1409
00:58:57,311 --> 00:58:58,144
He sliced them little bites and not,
well he did he blend it and put it into 

1410
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:06,450
the already blended peaches?
Yeah.

1411
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,293
Yeah.
Okay.

1412
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,370
I'm just trying to get the recipe 
straight.

1413
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:14,340
So if I'm gonna get this at home,
either course cleanups,

1414
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,183
a breeze.
You just leave everything there for 10 

1415
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:18,040
years.
Huh?

1416
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:28,550
Seriously.
Seriously.

1417
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,590
Hold on.
I'm suspicious of this.

1418
00:59:34,591 --> 00:59:36,090
Can I say that?
Okay.

1419
00:59:36,091 --> 00:59:37,710
Okay.
But in what way?

1420
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,370
I think it's might be an art piece.
Oh,

1421
00:59:41,371 --> 00:59:43,130
it's an art piece.
But regardless,

1422
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,260
I don't think this guy is real.
I think he might be an actor.

1423
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:46,761
No,
no,

1424
00:59:46,761 --> 00:59:46,911
no,
no,

1425
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:47,970
no.
You know what I'm saying?

1426
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,490
Way Too.
Specifical good way to spin.

1427
00:59:50,491 --> 00:59:51,324
He hates it.
He pours it out and yet still uploads 

1428
00:59:54,601 --> 00:59:55,440
it.
Let's see.

1429
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,120
Now you're getting now.
Now you're getting it.

1430
00:59:57,121 --> 00:59:58,620
No,
but it that they're all,

1431
00:59:58,650 --> 00:59:59,483
they're all like,
I can show you a video of a nine year 

1432
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:02,124
old that has a claw machine in his house
cause his mother like s like put a 

1433
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:06,743
reverse mortgage on her house to buy him
a claw machine that also looks like an 

1434
01:00:09,271 --> 01:00:11,490
art piece.
I believe this that they're like Ian,

1435
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:14,520
pull that up.
That's really going to be hard to find.

1436
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:19,410
That was like super,
but like it's like claw machine.

1437
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,390
Boy.
I guess this is just that this,

1438
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,550
I mean I'm not saying that it's for sure
fake,

1439
01:00:23,551 --> 01:00:24,384
but I'm still skeptical.
The thing is this predates kind of the 

1440
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:27,624
era.
I'm so skeptical of everything I see on 

1441
01:00:29,911 --> 01:00:31,710
the Internet to the point where I'm 
like,

1442
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,690
I don't know that this is real.
Of course.

1443
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:33,990
No,
no,

1444
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:34,823
there's,
there's,

1445
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,110
what do they do?
Bring all the fucking shit under there.

1446
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:37,840
Why not?
It's just a,

1447
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,680
why is there a toilet in the bowl?
Why is there a toilet in the room?

1448
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,180
He said no,
he goes to the bathroom.

1449
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:44,670
Why is he cooks in the bathroom?
Yeah.

1450
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:46,740
Where does he live?
Does he live in the bathroom?

1451
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:47,813
Okay.
You got to just take the whole thing as 

1452
01:00:49,501 --> 01:00:51,270
a package.
You can pick and choose,

1453
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,530
but that's,
I just,

1454
01:00:52,531 --> 01:00:54,780
I'm just saying I have,
I've seen red flag.

1455
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:55,621
He's,
okay.

1456
01:00:55,621 --> 01:00:57,720
So he's cooking.
He's hot dogs and peaches.

1457
01:00:57,721 --> 01:01:00,630
And you're confused that he's going to 
the bathroom to get the water?

1458
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,310
No,
but it's also perfect.

1459
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:03,203
It wouldn't be that hard to throw some 
tostitos and aback and bathroom right 

1460
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:08,334
out.
I mean,

1461
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,170
either way I listen.
I don't,

1462
01:01:10,171 --> 01:01:12,270
I don't want to take,
I think it's real.

1463
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:13,463
You don't have to know.
I like of all the conspiracies I've had 

1464
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:17,030
to walk people through,
you know,

1465
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:19,680
I'm a much happier to do this then like 
the moon,

1466
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:21,450
the moon,
Israel.

1467
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:22,373
I think the moon's real as far as I,
a friend does not think the moon is 

1468
01:01:24,991 --> 01:01:26,070
real.
You have a moon Downer.

1469
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,050
Deeply deep.
He would,

1470
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:30,390
he would draw drawed.
My friend drawn Carmichael,

1471
01:01:30,391 --> 01:01:32,430
who I did special for your trail.
He's very,

1472
01:01:32,431 --> 01:01:33,300
um,
well,

1473
01:01:33,301 --> 01:01:34,134
what's the story about the mountain?
Not that it's not real or does he 

1474
01:01:36,211 --> 01:01:38,290
actually think it's like a Hologram?
Oh No,

1475
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:39,124
no.
They'll going to the moon never 

1476
01:01:40,051 --> 01:01:40,884
happened.
Yeah.

1477
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,233
Yeah,
that'd be done.

1478
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:43,590
No,
no.

1479
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:44,423
They're going to the moon in that.
How do you still believe that in this 

1480
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,430
day and age?
That really blows my mind.

1481
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,500
He can make a good case.
Really?

1482
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:52,830
You want to try to convince me he would 
do a good job?

1483
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,210
I don't believe it,
but,

1484
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,520
but um,
the Moana is fake,

1485
01:01:56,521 --> 01:01:57,630
ladies and gentlemen.
You heard it.

1486
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,810
The moon.
It's doesn't exist at all.

1487
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,153
All right,
well

1488
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,520
I do want to see how this ends.
If I can be frank with you.

1489
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:06,490
I mean,
it looks very real.

1490
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:07,670
Everything okay?

1491
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,630
If it's fake,
it's the greatest production designer of

1492
01:02:10,631 --> 01:02:11,540
all time.
Right?

1493
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,990
Like it's beautifully put together.
That's true.

1494
01:02:13,991 --> 01:02:16,870
This guy would be going places right now
if he would be like,

1495
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:20,880
it just,
it just like incredibly up the flat,

1496
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:22,590
the two flashlights.
Are you kidding me?

1497
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,420
That's incredible detail.
Yeah.

1498
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,313
Okay.

1499
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:28,990
Oh,
he's,

1500
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,300
no,
he's not American.

1501
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:30,931
You know that,
right?

1502
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:32,580
He sounds like Scandinavian or 
something.

1503
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,350
Speaking English was,
you hear that?

1504
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:36,960
He said I hadn't caught that before and 
abandoned for a couple of days.

1505
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,180
Go back.
Let's put the pieces together.

1506
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:40,223
This might be,

1507
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,083
yeah.

1508
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,770
Oh,
what?

1509
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,700
That's weird.

1510
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:01,540
What is his house like?
Where if this is where he goes to cook,

1511
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:06,460
why does and why would a guy like this 
have like,

1512
01:03:06,461 --> 01:03:07,390
uh,
another,

1513
01:03:07,391 --> 01:03:11,080
he's got two houses on it.
I'd like to think he's like,

1514
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,333
yeah,
he was my assistant multimillionaire 

1515
01:03:13,751 --> 01:03:16,240
with like a bun,
like 15,

1516
01:03:16,241 --> 01:03:18,940
just shit holes.
This is real by the way.

1517
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,140
That,
but that detail like you could never,

1518
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:25,330
you can never write it.
You could never write it.

1519
01:03:25,331 --> 01:03:27,490
Yeah.
Stranger than fiction as they say.

1520
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,800
What is niceness?
Is this fuck with you?

1521
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:33,040
This is us right now.
Okay.

1522
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:34,570
You want to click it?
Let's see.

1523
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,300
Is this weird?
Wow.

1524
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,720
This is us live right now.
I hate it.

1525
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,200
And then,
no,

1526
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:41,471
no,
no.

1527
01:03:41,471 --> 01:03:43,420
You have to,
well you have to wait until we opened us

1528
01:03:43,421 --> 01:03:44,680
live.
Okay.

1529
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:46,810
Here,
let me mute it so that at least that,

1530
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,120
no,
no,

1531
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:47,350
no,
no.

1532
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:48,730
You have to like yell.
But then it's like,

1533
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:52,150
it's so bad cause they hear us through 
the laptop and it was just repetitive.

1534
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,460
I made that mistake before.
Okay.

1535
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,800
This is so weird that like,
God,

1536
01:03:56,801 --> 01:03:57,650
yeah,
this is too mad at,

1537
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,493
this is a,
this is a panic attack right now 

1538
01:03:59,861 --> 01:04:00,310
basically.
Yeah.

1539
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:01,420
This is what it feels like.
Yeah.

1540
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:04,090
This is,
I'm having a panic attack right now.

1541
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:06,640
Okay.
All right.

1542
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:07,510
We've,
we've,

1543
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,340
oh,
that's a good dude.

1544
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,030
It's awesome.
Wait,

1545
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,020
can we get more meadow with it?
Well,

1546
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:15,520
I just,
we just cut to the wide,

1547
01:04:15,521 --> 01:04:18,160
so in a moment it's going okay.
Good names within dreams.

1548
01:04:18,161 --> 01:04:19,480
Within dreams.
Have you seen the lights,

1549
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:22,630
camera,
Jackson's interstellar review reviews of

1550
01:04:22,631 --> 01:04:24,190
all time?
By the way,

1551
01:04:24,191 --> 01:04:25,870
I just want to say,
okay,

1552
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,013
that,
um,

1553
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,740
uh,
eighth grade,

1554
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:32,770
the reviews keep going up during the 
break.

1555
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,930
They're like rotten tomatoes up.

1556
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:39,100
It's at a 99.9
and to do points.

1557
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:39,791
Yeah,
no,

1558
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:41,490
it's at 99.9
and it's like,

1559
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:46,480
as you can get all like b minuses and 
still have 100% well that's fine.

1560
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:47,890
I mean,
it's still a good measurement.

1561
01:04:47,891 --> 01:04:50,380
It's like yes or no.
You know what I mean?

1562
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,790
Yeah.
Yes.

1563
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:52,653
And it's an emphatic,
we all loved this peaches or sausages 

1564
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,823
and we got all peaches baby.
It's all peaches here by all features 

1565
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,780
today.
Um,

1566
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,130
how do we,
where do we go from there?

1567
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,353
Um,
I got some other stuff we could talk 

1568
01:05:05,621 --> 01:05:06,730
about what you want,
man.

1569
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:09,580
Um,
a lot of bullshit,

1570
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,301
Yada,
Yada,

1571
01:05:10,301 --> 01:05:11,320
Yada.
Oh,

1572
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:12,700
here's something I do.
I do.

1573
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:18,510
Oh,
I got a button that does that.

1574
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,890
Okay.
Pretty cool.

1575
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:26,440
Um,
I saw you on the Green Room when you sat

1576
01:05:26,441 --> 01:05:27,640
with all those Comedians,
whatever.

1577
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:29,140
And you were the young guy and they were
all like,

1578
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:30,430
look at this young guy,
whatever.

1579
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,950
But there was one detail about that.
You don't wanna talk about it.

1580
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:34,510
It was fine.
It was being an asshole.

1581
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:36,820
Well,
anyway,

1582
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,910
I don't,
I'm,

1583
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:39,970
I love Gary shandling.
He's like,

1584
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,260
I have totally the bad news for you.
Yeah.

1585
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,353
Wait,
what is it?

1586
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,220
He's fine.
He's living happily did.

1587
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,300
Yeah.
Yes.

1588
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,680
Rest in peace.
He would have liked that.

1589
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:55,450
Maybe the cellar doors slammed.
I do know he's passed.

1590
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,284
So like,
but I love so much this moment there 

1591
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:00,700
when they introduced you and you're 
like,

1592
01:06:00,701 --> 01:06:02,120
Hey,
I'm from the new generation and I,

1593
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,730
and I was just wondering who are you 
guys?

1594
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:07,150
And I could tell a lot of them were,
were rubbed the wrong way by that.

1595
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,313
A lot of the guys were like,
specifically I thought like Mark Marin 

1596
01:06:10,961 --> 01:06:13,150
was like,
look at this fucking kid,

1597
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,350
you know?
Yeah.

1598
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:15,243
But whatever.
But then garry shandling came out with 

1599
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:19,324
this beautiful response of like,
well that's so great that you say that 

1600
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:22,870
because the feeling so mutual.

1601
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:23,231
Yeah.
Yeah.

1602
01:06:23,231 --> 01:06:25,750
It was perfect.
But not only was he perfectly funny,

1603
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:26,853
I feel like you,
you weren't dear to him and that 

1604
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:33,190
throughout the rest of it he was very 
supportive and very accepting of you and

1605
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:35,110
just really a sweetheart.
Yeah.

1606
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,233
And I was,
I'm just wondering if you had any other 

1607
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:38,380
interactions with them.
Yeah,

1608
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,180
I sort of had a relationship with them 
going forward.

1609
01:06:40,181 --> 01:06:41,110
Like,
um,

1610
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,380
that's what we like go over.
Yeah.

1611
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,190
You play ball with him.
I didn't,

1612
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,083
it was more just one on one,
just going over there on weekends and 

1613
01:06:48,431 --> 01:06:49,264
like sitting with him for a while and he
actually read the script of this movie 

1614
01:06:51,391 --> 01:06:52,810
is where the first really?
Yeah.

1615
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:53,773
Wow.
He's just super nice and super deep and 

1616
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:58,630
kind and just as smart,
just a deep kind person,

1617
01:06:58,631 --> 01:07:01,540
which are just very cool and very like 
patient and open.

1618
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,460
Um,
but yeah,

1619
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:06,550
there's nothing worse than five 
comedians sitting around performing.

1620
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:08,240
I mean,
it's so fucking,

1621
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:09,543
I don't know that,
not that I ever being just mean like 

1622
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,280
everyone tried to outdo each other.
It's,

1623
01:07:13,281 --> 01:07:17,290
so,
I feel like that situation was something

1624
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:18,900
that I would hate to ever be involved 
in,

1625
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:23,140
just cause it's like so competitive.
It has to be.

1626
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,093
Otherwise you just,
if you don't want to compete to like 

1627
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:27,423
prove how funny or witty you are,
you just sit there like a fucking idiot 

1628
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,280
doing bits in life.
It gets very,

1629
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:34,360
very exhausting.
Um,

1630
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:35,223
but that was a,
that was actually kind of a fun one 

1631
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,740
because I was so young and it was just 
like,

1632
01:07:38,741 --> 01:07:39,574
so different than it felt like we could 
all just sorta fuck with each other a 

1633
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:42,251
little bit.
But,

1634
01:07:42,251 --> 01:07:43,480
you know,
um,

1635
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,670
you know,
get Gary's dude.

1636
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:47,230
Good Dude.
I love him.

1637
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,060
I mean,
well,

1638
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:49,894
okay.
I don't.

1639
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:50,770
Okay,
cool.

1640
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,050
We talked about that.
Yeah.

1641
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:53,163
Great.
He's a very zen eastern now he's such a 

1642
01:07:56,081 --> 01:07:58,180
Buddhist guy and like are you into that 
shit?

1643
01:07:59,050 --> 01:07:59,883
I wish I was.
You feel like you could be and I wish I 

1644
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,160
was.
Yeah,

1645
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:04,503
I keep trying,
but then I never do like I bought a 

1646
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:08,550
bunch of books and I'm like,
I'll read those some day.

1647
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:10,630
Yeah.
But as they say,

1648
01:08:10,631 --> 01:08:14,380
it's in the buying that the,
as they say,

1649
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:15,543
you just like put the verb first and you
let the books in your shelf and they 

1650
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:18,764
will by proximity man,
who's stands lesson toilet get high on 

1651
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:24,914
pot.
Yeah.

1652
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:26,020
Right.
Um,

1653
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:27,590
that was much better than one.
I said.

1654
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:30,170
What was yours?
It really didn't go anywhere at all.

1655
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,990
I don't know.
I was a fifth grade thing I heard.

1656
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,950
Um,
yeah.

1657
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:34,970
Anyway.
Are you,

1658
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:35,600
are you Buddhist?

1659
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,280
Are you into all of that,
that you stern stuff?

1660
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:42,550
I'm more into the idea of religion than 
I was as a cool ass 19 year old atheist.

1661
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:47,510
You have come around not around.
I just like,

1662
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:52,540
I don't really hold like it takes up so 
little of my mind criticizing it or no,

1663
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,433
you,
you like felt,

1664
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:58,130
you felt when you were younger that need
to be like,

1665
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:00,620
God dude.
And now I'm like,

1666
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:01,483
ah,
I mean whatever you get through the 

1667
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,360
moment.
I feel the same exact way.

1668
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:07,490
There's something about when you're 
young and you're like,

1669
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,353
I'm fucking so smart.
I get this shit 80 it's like you think 

1670
01:09:11,691 --> 01:09:14,270
there's a guy in the sky?
Yeah.

1671
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:15,673
It's like there are people a lot smarter
than you that are religious so it isn't 

1672
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,560
inherently a dumb idea.
So it's like,

1673
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:24,290
what do you understand about the 
university little fucking idiot?

1674
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,060
What do you understand about your own 
head?

1675
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:26,780
Yeah,
I mean like,

1676
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:30,020
like that's the thing is that like the 
subjective experience.

1677
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:33,080
It's so mind blowingly impossible to 
understand that.

1678
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,010
Sure.
God,

1679
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:36,800
you know what I mean?
Like I don't do that.

1680
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:40,880
We're any of any of this is happening.
God weirder than like anything that just

1681
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,220
existing,
I don't believe in God necessarily,

1682
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:47,290
but I don't not believe in God.
I believe in buying books about Buddhism

1683
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:48,890
and putting on my bookshelf.
Yeah.

1684
01:09:48,891 --> 01:09:50,600
Well we,
we,

1685
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:52,920
we pray to the god of brick and mortar.
Yeah.

1686
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,760
Um,
did you go to a brick and mortar?

1687
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:56,960
Was it online?
Online?

1688
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:58,300
Come on.
I'm a home.

1689
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,133
Homesman exactly.
You think I'd show up around a book 

1690
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:02,760
store.
Have you,

1691
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,160
when's the last time you went to a 
bookstore?

1692
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:06,920
I go to bookstores.
I like to walk around a bookstore.

1693
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:10,310
Nice mom and pop shop like an Amazon 
books.

1694
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,560
You know,
the Amazon makes bookstores.

1695
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:13,880
Those are great.
Real down to earth.

1696
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,990
Are you serious?
Yeah.

1697
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:15,890
They have bookstore.
Yeah.

1698
01:10:15,891 --> 01:10:18,320
Yeah.
They went and like just did you not have

1699
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:20,530
enough of the market?
But they literally true.

1700
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:21,403
They literally destroyed bookstores and 
then like down and they're basically 

1701
01:10:24,351 --> 01:10:26,310
dancing the absolutely.
No,

1702
01:10:26,311 --> 01:10:26,481
no,
no.

1703
01:10:26,481 --> 01:10:29,420
They're like fucking their wives on 
their graves.

1704
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:30,963
I'm moving next door to like,
Jeff's book starts like this just old 

1705
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:35,820
fucking place.
Yeah.

1706
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:38,660
Um,
Amazon bookstores.

1707
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:40,850
I go to churches to,
when I'm in the city,

1708
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,713
I'll go to a church and sit down.
You'll sit down through the thing 

1709
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,400
usually like on off hours because it's 
like,

1710
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,780
why do you go there?
Do you pray?

1711
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:49,440
I'll see.
Contemplating.

1712
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:50,413
Yeah.
You find that the environment does 

1713
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,050
something quiet.
Well,

1714
01:10:54,051 --> 01:10:54,884
the church I've been to churches and 
cathedrals and there's definitely a 

1715
01:10:57,771 --> 01:10:58,420
vibe,
you know,

1716
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,540
it's great.
It's like,

1717
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:02,840
and like you really can't be on your 
phone when you're in there.

1718
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:03,733
It's not even about God.
It's almost just about like the 

1719
01:11:05,241 --> 01:11:09,170
quietness of like just being,
there is something divine in existence.

1720
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:13,380
Let's just say agree we don't agree on,
but let's just say I think that,

1721
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:13,980
but

1722
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,813
like you really feel that there and it's
like you don't have to believe in Jesus 

1723
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,263
Christ.
You don't have to look at a guy in a 

1724
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:20,730
cross,
but there's something divine about being

1725
01:11:20,731 --> 01:11:21,564
alive and you feel that there.
And like silence is as valuable as its 

1726
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:29,160
ever been.
Like silent attention is like so rare to

1727
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:32,020
get a less stimulation.
Um,

1728
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:36,600
can I go to a church?
I'm Jewish by gorgeous ethnicity.

1729
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:37,141
Yeah.
If you don't mind,

1730
01:11:37,141 --> 01:11:38,470
you're not going to help me out and can 
be like,

1731
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:41,550
somebody is not gonna be like you look a
little Jewish.

1732
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,240
Can I see your id?
Uh,

1733
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,480
he wouldn't say a little strange.
Well he wouldn't come out that.

1734
01:11:46,481 --> 01:11:47,130
So we've got,
um,

1735
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:48,540
uh,
thank you by the way.

1736
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,460
If you're cool with,
you know,

1737
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,190
I think you might,
I can't go to a synagogue.

1738
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,200
Hell yeah.
Where I belong.

1739
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:56,093
Yeah.

1740
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,500
It's party there.
Um,

1741
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:01,740
but yeah,
church is for everybody.

1742
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,380
I didn't know that.
I think so.

1743
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:07,140
Is that what they say?
No,

1744
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,790
but no,
no.

1745
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,080
I think a lot of them,
I like,

1746
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:12,350
my mom goes to like a Presbyterian 
whatever and the,

1747
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,570
the guy was like,
anyone's welcome at this table if you're

1748
01:12:15,571 --> 01:12:16,980
trans,
if you're this,

1749
01:12:16,981 --> 01:12:19,260
if it was like things are changing,
things are changing.

1750
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,890
Can I talk about your mom?
You have,

1751
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:24,090
your mom has a really interesting 
vocation.

1752
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,160
She a hospice nurse.
Yeah.

1753
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,430
She'd been doing hospice.
I mean stupid boss diminishes,

1754
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,930
which is basically she takes care of end
of life.

1755
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:33,030
Yeah.
And she works in a hospice center.

1756
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:35,200
So a lot of hospice nurses are out of 
how,

1757
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,570
you know,
they'll go to,

1758
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:39,240
they'll go to a dying patient in their 
house,

1759
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:40,103
but the,
this is where dying patients come and 

1760
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:42,330
it's end of life care.

1761
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:44,550
So the average day is two weeks,
no one recovers.

1762
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,170
You know when you go there you do not 
leave.

1763
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:49,260
They are,
see she sees three or four deaths a day.

1764
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:50,183
What is it,
I'm curious just systematically how 

1765
01:12:52,231 --> 01:12:55,860
people end up there.
Is it like a health insurance thing?

1766
01:12:55,861 --> 01:12:57,890
Is it like a government thing?
Um,

1767
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:00,360
that's a great question.
Um,

1768
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:02,940
I mean it's,
it's,

1769
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:03,773
it's when the dying process starts,
I mean it's when the illness is fully 

1770
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:11,490
move Oli terminal moving out of the 
hospital and into,

1771
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:14,490
into a place where it's called end of 
life care,

1772
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:15,324
where you're just trying to make them 
uncomfortable and think about how that 

1773
01:13:17,881 --> 01:13:19,740
came into exist.
Is it part of the hospital?

1774
01:13:19,741 --> 01:13:21,360
Like who runs that?
I have no idea.

1775
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,373
I don't,
that's Kinda like where did that come 

1776
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:25,981
from?
You know what I mean?

1777
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:27,290
Yeah.
Um Huh.

1778
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:33,550
Cause most hospice is the specific out 
of institute.

1779
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:35,963
Like,
it's actually just nurses going to take 

1780
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:39,120
care of you at home,
so you're tying in your home.

1781
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:40,680
Um,
this sort of thing.

1782
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:43,230
A hospice center is much,
much rare,

1783
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,700
but no,
it's a lot of donations and things.

1784
01:13:44,701 --> 01:13:46,070
I mean like it's not just,
you know,

1785
01:13:46,071 --> 01:13:48,270
like a for profit place.
Um,

1786
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:50,010
but yeah,
it's pretty cool.

1787
01:13:50,011 --> 01:13:51,750
How was that like,
I mean,

1788
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:54,360
affected her and maybe even you by 
proxy,

1789
01:13:54,361 --> 01:13:56,640
I mean surely that trickles down to you 
too as well.

1790
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:57,474
Yeah.
I mean she's doing it nine or 10 years 

1791
01:13:59,071 --> 01:14:02,460
now and um,
it's insane.

1792
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:02,991
You know,
she,

1793
01:14:02,991 --> 01:14:03,824
she have,
after the first two weeks of working 

1794
01:14:05,611 --> 01:14:09,030
there,
she forgot the president's name,

1795
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:12,070
so she went to the hospital to get a cat
scan because she thought she had a brain

1796
01:14:12,071 --> 01:14:14,290
tumor and she went to work the next day 
and her boss said,

1797
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,360
that just happens here and you just 
forget you,

1798
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,293
you're just going to be blocking so much
of what's happening out here that it's 

1799
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:20,620
con like that.

1800
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:21,431
He's like,
Oh,

1801
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:23,980
if you only told me,
I would've told you that that happens to

1802
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:25,120
everybody here.
Yeah,

1803
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:25,871
yeah,
exactly.

1804
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:28,660
And like when she was getting ready to 
interview for the place,

1805
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:31,030
she saw like a body getting carried out.
Like,

1806
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:31,893
I can't fucking do this.
And then two weeks in she's carrying a 

1807
01:14:33,851 --> 01:14:36,130
body out,
chatting with the nurse's assistant,

1808
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,200
puts in the car and turns around and 
it's like,

1809
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:39,520
whoa,
crazy.

1810
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:40,354
And I'll be with her.
Like a diner in a family will come up 

1811
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:42,910
and be like,
Patty,

1812
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:44,200
Patty,
oh my God.

1813
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:45,700
Like,
you know,

1814
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:48,670
cause she saw her,
you know,

1815
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,020
they're,
you know,

1816
01:14:50,021 --> 01:14:53,560
father through his last two weeks of his
life and they'll leave and she'll go,

1817
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:55,720
I don't remember them.
It's like the most,

1818
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:59,830
she'll be some like the most important 
people in some people's lives for,

1819
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,000
you know,
five of them a day.

1820
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,470
And it's like,
man,

1821
01:15:02,471 --> 01:15:04,350
how does that affect her?
It has their personality changes.

1822
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:08,320
She's incredibly stable and like it,
it's all women.

1823
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:10,210
You know,
it's like mostly all women there.

1824
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,073
And it's like,
uh,

1825
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:12,363
it's like a really incredible example of
like the sort of condescended 

1826
01:15:17,231 --> 01:15:20,530
stereotyped quality of,
of women of like,

1827
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,393
Oh yeah,
women are maternal and women are very 

1828
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:24,220
caring,
but it's like a,

1829
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,193
a like military,
like as as tough a version of that is 

1830
01:15:29,831 --> 01:15:30,664
can be,
and you actually realize that like 

1831
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:36,900
caring is actually,
is actually the most tough and resilient

1832
01:15:37,091 --> 01:15:37,924
thing you can actually do at its extreme
that I'm saying people come back from 

1833
01:15:40,691 --> 01:15:41,830
war,
you know,

1834
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:42,723
unable to fucking process thoughts.
My mother comes back from watching like 

1835
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,673
a 40,
40 year old bleed out in front of his 

1836
01:15:50,471 --> 01:15:53,140
family and she comes to like,
you know,

1837
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:55,540
smiles and cooks us dinner.

1838
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,680
You know,
like that is,

1839
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:58,450
that is actual strength,
you know,

1840
01:15:58,451 --> 01:15:59,141
and it,
and it is,

1841
01:15:59,141 --> 01:16:00,310
um,
yeah,

1842
01:16:00,311 --> 01:16:01,540
she's wild,
wild stories.

1843
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:03,340
Wild that is,
you know,

1844
01:16:03,341 --> 01:16:04,174
people dying of alcoholism and she will 
dip a qtip and Jack Daniels and swab it 

1845
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:09,640
and their mouth.
Wow.

1846
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,600
You know,
cause it's just,

1847
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:13,690
it's just people dying of lung cancer.
She takes them out,

1848
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,673
she wields it out into the snow and 
holds a cigarette to their lips because 

1849
01:16:16,481 --> 01:16:17,314
they're two weeks.
Eh,

1850
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,640
you know,
cause it's just end of life care.

1851
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:21,160
It's not about they're venting and it's 
also very medical.

1852
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:23,300
She's also like a nurse practitioner.
I mean she's a,

1853
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:27,070
she knows what she's worked in the Er,
she's done these things.

1854
01:16:27,071 --> 01:16:28,260
So,
but um,

1855
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:30,130
yeah,
it's wild.

1856
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:30,993
You know,
that's gotta be one of the craziest 

1857
01:16:32,141 --> 01:16:35,230
fucking jobs you can possibly be for 
family members showing up.

1858
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:37,390
Like threatening to fucking kill people.

1859
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:39,160
Like get my dad out of here.
You shouldn't be what?

1860
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:39,994
I mean like,
oh fucking not adding to terms with it 

1861
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:45,160
or like they don't want them here or 
they're confused or they're,

1862
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:47,500
you know,
it's,

1863
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:53,040
well I can say just from like my wife 
Isla is going through something with her

1864
01:16:53,381 --> 01:16:56,800
dad right now and like just hearing her 
talking about it is like,

1865
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:59,560
it's so,
it's just so fucked up.

1866
01:16:59,561 --> 01:17:00,394
Like we're so bad at dealing with death,
we don't think about it until it's 

1867
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:05,380
there.
And so like these women,

1868
01:17:05,381 --> 01:17:06,500
these nurses that are,
that are,

1869
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:07,343
were,
are like such rocks for people because 

1870
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:10,394
my mother will sit there and go like,
she knows how to deal with it and she 

1871
01:17:12,321 --> 01:17:15,080
knows what it looks like.
Like everybody,

1872
01:17:15,081 --> 01:17:19,220
she knows how to deal with it and it's,
and dealing with it as in like they make

1873
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:19,730
it easier.

1874
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:20,580
But she,
she'll,

1875
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:23,030
she,
she can say like,

1876
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:26,390
she's never seen last words in her life 
ever.

1877
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,890
She says they almost,
they almost never speak for the last two

1878
01:17:30,891 --> 01:17:33,800
hours.
There is a last breath,

1879
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:36,860
but there's almost never a last word.
It's like really,

1880
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:39,120
really incredibly,
incredibly fast.

1881
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:40,933
She was on an episode of,
cause I talked a little bit about this 

1882
01:17:44,481 --> 01:17:47,360
on Marin's podcast like a long time ago 
and uh,

1883
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:50,610
Nancy Updike from this American life 
herd and they did it this American life.

1884
01:17:50,611 --> 01:17:51,444
And on my ma,
half of it's on my mom and you can hear 

1885
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:54,850
her in the hospice center.
It's,

1886
01:17:54,851 --> 01:17:56,960
it's like,
and some people,

1887
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:57,823
you know,
it sucks for her because it's such an 

1888
01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:03,290
interesting job and of course it is 
emotionally taxing and she needs to talk

1889
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:04,460
about it,
but it's like,

1890
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:05,323
it's such a hard thing to talk about 
because people care about and they go 

1891
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:08,270
like,
I just can't fucking hear that.

1892
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:09,493
But it definitely puts,
it puts my job in a perspective very 

1893
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:12,000
easily.
Yeah.

1894
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,200
Do you mean where I can just be like,
oh,

1895
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,420
who gives a shit?
What happens with,

1896
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:16,010
you know,
this thing or that like,

1897
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:17,443
I just,
I wonder if like we as a society and 

1898
01:18:19,671 --> 01:18:22,040
this kind of a fucking ridiculous 
question out there,

1899
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:24,560
but like if we just dealt with death 
better,

1900
01:18:24,561 --> 01:18:26,270
you know what I mean?
Like it's just,

1901
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,133
it's this buggy.
We all obviously know we're going to 

1902
01:18:28,731 --> 01:18:30,050
die.
But like the thought of it,

1903
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,240
the prepping of it,
the Association of it,

1904
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:35,330
the way that,
like we prolonging it,

1905
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:39,080
even when it's over like this,
this is what this is,

1906
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,233
is that when people are dying and 
they're on death's bed certain to die 

1907
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,920
and they're suffering,
there's no quality of life.

1908
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:46,370
And,
um,

1909
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:48,020
the family suffering,
the person suffering,

1910
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:50,730
it's like you prolonged that for as long
as possible.

1911
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,190
I don't understand that.
Yeah.

1912
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:54,650
I think we've done better with grief 
than we have death.

1913
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,131
You know what I mean?
We,

1914
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:55,760
we,
we,

1915
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,593
like,
there's,

1916
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,720
there's more of an infrastructure for 
the grieving process,

1917
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:00,680
you know,
I think,

1918
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,820
um,
like we're,

1919
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:05,450
we're more familiar with that.
I'm saying before,

1920
01:19:05,451 --> 01:19:06,081
we may,
like,

1921
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:08,630
we've experienced funerals,
we know what that is,

1922
01:19:08,631 --> 01:19:12,320
we know that space a little bit.
Those are very public and right.

1923
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:13,154
Yeah.
But the dying process for people 

1924
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:17,820
unfamiliar with it is intense.
And my grandfather,

1925
01:19:17,821 --> 01:19:21,440
my father's father died at the hospice 
center my mom was working at,

1926
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:24,520
but she couldn't work with him because 
they don't let you work.

1927
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:25,620
Conflict of interest.
Yeah.

1928
01:19:25,621 --> 01:19:26,630
Yeah.
Well the,

1929
01:19:26,631 --> 01:19:28,490
the,
there's interest,

1930
01:19:28,491 --> 01:19:29,121
but like,
yeah,

1931
01:19:29,121 --> 01:19:30,130
just like fucked up.
It's,

1932
01:19:30,131 --> 01:19:30,771
uh,
it's like,

1933
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:32,570
it just wouldn't be healthy or 
something.

1934
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:33,801
Yeah.
And that,

1935
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:34,640
I mean,
but yeah,

1936
01:19:34,641 --> 01:19:36,770
like my mother will come home like 
having a rough day and it's like,

1937
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:37,190
what was it?

1938
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:37,721
It's like,
yeah,

1939
01:19:37,721 --> 01:19:39,350
it was a young person,
you know,

1940
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:40,243
it's like fucking ends.
And it's in Massachusetts in like this 

1941
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:44,810
beautiful,
weird,

1942
01:19:44,811 --> 01:19:46,100
centered,
all of these windows.

1943
01:19:46,101 --> 01:19:48,770
And like the seasons are changing and 
it's like,

1944
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,323
I would love to make a movie about it.
It's just like a little too crazy and 

1945
01:19:52,341 --> 01:19:55,310
heavy.
This subject matters is very interesting

1946
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:58,130
and I think it's something that really 
should be explored honestly.

1947
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,293
It's like,
I wonder if there's a way to make it 

1948
01:20:00,741 --> 01:20:04,430
that isn't brutally depressing.
You know what I mean?

1949
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,800
I know.
I don't think there is,

1950
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:09,420
but could be beautifully depressing 
maybe.

1951
01:20:09,421 --> 01:20:12,540
But like there's one story that she told
me this like incredible.

1952
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:15,180
Um,
one of her nurses aids,

1953
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,440
um,
lots of immigrants that,

1954
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,100
that work there.
And she,

1955
01:20:19,101 --> 01:20:19,934
she was a Haitian immigrant and she was 
in the room holding something in her 

1956
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:24,570
arms,
in a towel.

1957
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,790
And My mother was working with,
uh,

1958
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:32,610
older gentleman who was very sick and 
sort of out of it.

1959
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:36,120
And My mother was like,
um,

1960
01:20:36,121 --> 01:20:40,320
so she's going to take care of you now.
And the old guy said some racial slur,

1961
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,210
you know,
this is a black woman.

1962
01:20:42,211 --> 01:20:43,044
And it says like,
I don't want that whatever touching me 

1963
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:45,624
or getting near me.
And mother turns to the nurse and she's 

1964
01:20:48,751 --> 01:20:49,584
like,
you know,

1965
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,160
putting this stuff into him that like 
cox and out for a little bit so they can

1966
01:20:53,161 --> 01:20:55,950
like change his bedding and everything.
And my mom turns to the nurse's aide and

1967
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:57,150
like,
you don't have to do this.

1968
01:20:57,151 --> 01:20:59,520
Like he said,
that's really inappropriate.

1969
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:00,420
You know,
I'll do this,

1970
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:01,680
don't worry.
And she's going,

1971
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:01,951
no,
no,

1972
01:21:01,951 --> 01:21:02,100
no,
no,

1973
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:02,933
no,
no holding singling.

1974
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:03,270
No,
no,

1975
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:03,931
it's okay.
It's okay.

1976
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:04,764
Okay.
Like hearing all this and my mother 

1977
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:07,404
watches is the guy I'm like dozes off 
for a bit and the woman opens the towel 

1978
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:16,590
and she'd been warming lotion while he's
saying all this stuff to her.

1979
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:20,130
She was warming lotion for him and she's
passed out sports and it gives him like,

1980
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:24,680
like works into his feet and his hands.
That's after hearing her compassion.

1981
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:26,700
I,
it's like incredible.

1982
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:28,410
It's like,
you know,

1983
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:28,921
the,
the,

1984
01:21:28,921 --> 01:21:33,600
the people that do this are like true,
truly angels and they're angels.

1985
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,030
And then you,
I go to,

1986
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:35,933
you know,
I go to the hospice center all the time 

1987
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:38,101
to check in and,
you know,

1988
01:21:38,101 --> 01:21:40,150
seeing my mom and it's like a bunch of,
you know,

1989
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,820
little Boston ladies being like,
Oh,

1990
01:21:41,821 --> 01:21:42,990
ball,
you're out in the Hollywood.

1991
01:21:42,991 --> 01:21:43,890
Oh my God,
can we get,

1992
01:21:43,891 --> 01:21:45,030
you know what I mean?
They're like little,

1993
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:46,260
it's incredible.
It's,

1994
01:21:46,261 --> 01:21:47,460
it's a,
it's,

1995
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,310
it's a crazy little world.
There,

1996
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:50,881
there was,
there was,

1997
01:21:50,881 --> 01:21:53,180
I think it was an hbo show about it.
Um,

1998
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:55,440
I never saw it,
but moving,

1999
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:58,980
I would definitely love to watch 
anything about that.

2000
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,380
It's just,
I think a documentary,

2001
01:22:00,381 --> 01:22:01,270
I'd be the best.
I mean,

2002
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:02,253
I you,
the respect of the family makes it 

2003
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,670
because you couldn't really do it,
but I,

2004
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:07,190
right.
That you should listen to.

2005
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:08,460
It's called death and taxes.
The,

2006
01:22:08,461 --> 01:22:09,510
this American life.
I'll check it.

2007
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:10,590
Pretty incredible.
Love it.

2008
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:12,780
Love that show.
Um,

2009
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:14,900
well thanks for sharing that.
Yeah.

2010
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:16,351
Do you,
well,

2011
01:22:16,351 --> 01:22:20,910
let's,
so let's switch gear and please,

2012
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:23,540
um,
you know,

2013
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:25,140
I used to do this thing at the end of 
our show.

2014
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:26,910
We used to ask people if that goes 
stories.

2015
01:22:26,911 --> 01:22:30,360
But frankly I don't,
I'd rather do something else with you.

2016
01:22:30,361 --> 01:22:30,960
Okay.
Can I,

2017
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:31,530
yeah,
I don't,

2018
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,550
yeah,
I didn't think you would.

2019
01:22:32,551 --> 01:22:33,384
And I frankly don't either.
I don't even know why it's still going 

2020
01:22:35,521 --> 01:22:36,210
on.
It's like,

2021
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:37,140
do you have ghost stories?
They're like,

2022
01:22:37,141 --> 01:22:37,561
no.
It was like,

2023
01:22:37,561 --> 01:22:38,394
yeah,
I don't either.

2024
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:43,200
Like our fans got into this thing about 
ghost stories and I'm like,

2025
01:22:43,201 --> 01:22:44,490
I don't,
I don't believe in ghosts.

2026
01:22:44,491 --> 01:22:46,560
You guys,
regardless,

2027
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:49,590
I'm want to do a new thing,
which is that I've werewolf stories.

2028
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:52,783
Um,
I find the perfect video to watch with 

2029
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:56,370
my guest.
Hell yeah.

2030
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,700
To close up the show.
And I think I found the perfect video to

2031
01:22:59,701 --> 01:23:00,534
watch with the,
okay.

2032
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:02,910
So first of all,
let me hit you with one of these.

2033
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:06,310
Okay.
Now Bo in the house

2034
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:07,143
is a origin meme.
It's kind of one of our earliest and 

2035
01:23:10,481 --> 01:23:11,314
best music,
I would say in reaction to one of the 

2036
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:16,420
best videos on the Internet.
Um,

2037
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,470
it's Papa John.
Yeah,

2038
01:23:17,471 --> 01:23:19,350
I actually do remember this.
You know the Papa John's do.

2039
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,740
I do remember that.
This is the tour of his house,

2040
01:23:20,741 --> 01:23:21,250
right?
Yeah,

2041
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:22,480
yeah,
yeah.

2042
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:25,930
I haven't seen this a little,
so I thought we'd watch it together.

2043
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:28,510
Know I do have the name of some like 
asshole.

2044
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:30,220
You mean like some asshole kid?
Well,

2045
01:23:30,221 --> 01:23:33,310
there was no like you saw Chris Southern
quarter ballot be oh,

2046
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,353
oh,
he's being,

2047
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:36,340
you know how this motherfucker's spells 
his name?

2048
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:37,460
You do.
You just said it.

2049
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:40,610
I was like that.
My French fucking bright.

2050
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:41,401
Yeah,
no,

2051
01:23:41,401 --> 01:23:42,760
no.
Yeah,

2052
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:45,700
of course not.
I feel bad for him in a way though.

2053
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:48,330
He probably got his ass beat in high 
school though.

2054
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:49,450
Oh,
well the good thing.

2055
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:50,730
Well,
it's not like we're bringing them up and

2056
01:23:50,731 --> 01:23:52,850
eat again to be shamed publicly in front
of thousands.

2057
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:53,760
Well,
he's just,

2058
01:23:53,761 --> 01:23:56,300
he's grown up.
He's come to terms with the pizza man.

2059
01:23:56,710 --> 01:23:58,660
His Dad is kind of taking the heat off 
him.

2060
01:23:58,850 --> 01:24:03,850
Like I say that his dad is,
I like it was on a conference call.

2061
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:10,470
Yeah,
he dropped the n bomb pop.

2062
01:24:10,991 --> 01:24:13,480
It doesn't have the best track record.
Yeah.

2063
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,580
Yeah.
So hoppa John,

2064
01:24:15,581 --> 01:24:17,050
man,
I love Papa John.

2065
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:19,270
He's like,
he's just got so high curls.

2066
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,250
Oh,
we got that hot,

2067
01:24:21,251 --> 01:24:22,084
luxurious by,
you know what I always say about Papa 

2068
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:25,570
John?
He looks like a hammerhead shark.

2069
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:26,770
He,
nope.

2070
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,150
That's not what I say,
but I like it.

2071
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:31,420
It looks like he's too close to a pizza 
oven for too long,

2072
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:32,283
because you know what I mean?
Like let's pull up a zap of Papa John 

2073
01:24:34,841 --> 01:24:35,674
here.
Let's give you guys the whole lore 

2074
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:40,300
overview before we,
before we dive in head first year.

2075
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:41,613
No,
I don't want Google to know my fucking 

2076
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:46,120
location.
He always looks a little wet.

2077
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:49,300
That is what I mean.
Like the cheese is melted on his face.

2078
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,193
Yeah.
He looks like that pizza is a little 

2079
01:24:51,011 --> 01:24:52,120
overcooked.
You know what I'm saying?

2080
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:54,580
Right.
Yeah.

2081
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:57,010
He looks like just,
it's not,

2082
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:00,430
it looks like he's own wax sculpture.
That's right.

2083
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,140
That's,
that's a good way to put it.

2084
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:04,900
He's clearly had some work,
but man,

2085
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,930
nothing can fix man.
That left eye is nothing.

2086
01:25:07,931 --> 01:25:10,780
Trying to look at someone else.
Nothing could have fixed.

2087
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:12,790
Look at those brows,
Bro.

2088
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:14,313
Couple pepperoni's look at this.
Danny Zuko Curley's trying to rock up 

2089
01:25:18,521 --> 01:25:21,300
top and like,
I mean that like,

2090
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:23,380
I will say to his credit,
he's an incredible,

2091
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:24,383
he's,
he really was a guy with the pizza 

2092
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:27,160
joint.
The grew it out of nowhere.

2093
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:28,630
Yeah.
Well you know what?

2094
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:30,160
Some pizza joints got to work.

2095
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:34,150
So here,
let me show you this.

2096
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:35,230
I mean,
wait,

2097
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:37,210
it's Papa John's the one with the garlic
sauce.

2098
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:38,650
Yeah.
It's actually pretty good.

2099
01:25:38,651 --> 01:25:41,230
I Love Papa John's.
It started from a real place.

2100
01:25:41,231 --> 01:25:43,480
This whole papa bless it started from a 
real place of,

2101
01:25:43,481 --> 01:25:45,550
of love for Boppa.
You know what I mean?

2102
01:25:45,551 --> 01:25:47,470
Uh,
he various shit faced.

2103
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:51,190
Yeah.
I mean,

2104
01:25:51,191 --> 01:25:53,470
here you go.
Just get it close up.

2105
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:56,560
Yeah.
He's got a real nineties magician vibe,

2106
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,573
right?
Yeah.

2107
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:58,553
Like a,
remember those shows on ABC where the 

2108
01:25:59,891 --> 01:26:02,500
guy would wear white mask and expose all
the time.

2109
01:26:02,501 --> 01:26:04,280
I love that magician at home.
It'd be like,

2110
01:26:04,281 --> 01:26:05,900
what the fuck dude,
that was him,

2111
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:09,700
the one ingredient home line.
Uh,

2112
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:13,340
but what was it I wanted to show you?
Oh,

2113
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,550
I don't know if there's so much papa 
John Content does show you.

2114
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:20,510
Papa is in the house.
Is Really,

2115
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:21,890
they should is nuts.

2116
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:26,090
Not this is like a separate computer 
just for this.

2117
01:26:26,091 --> 01:26:29,180
Right.
I would like never broadcast my,

2118
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:31,820
my,
my browser.

2119
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,250
I was like be terrifying.
So no,

2120
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:34,881
well,
yeah,

2121
01:26:34,881 --> 01:26:35,391
yeah,
yeah,

2122
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:35,950
yes,
yes.

2123
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:37,280
Yeah.
My related video,

2124
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:37,971
you'd be like,
no,

2125
01:26:37,971 --> 01:26:38,481
no,
no,

2126
01:26:38,481 --> 01:26:38,941
no,

2127
01:26:38,941 --> 01:26:39,441
no,
no.

2128
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:40,091
Okay.
No,

2129
01:26:40,091 --> 01:26:40,350
no,
no,

2130
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:41,183
no,
no.

2131
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:43,910
This is just for here baby.
I'm all good.

2132
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,220
No history on this one.
Yeah.

2133
01:26:46,221 --> 01:26:49,610
It's like a destiny's child feet that 
was giving.

2134
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,900
No,
I feel you man.

2135
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:53,420
I'm here.
This is the one I wanted to show you.

2136
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,313
Just the beginning.
They staged this whole ridiculous 

2137
01:26:57,711 --> 01:27:00,560
promotional thing and I love how he 
thinks he's like a celebrity.

2138
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:02,390
Like he's a pizza celebrity.
You know what I mean?

2139
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:05,190
It's a shit.
Oh,

2140
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:10,330
hey.
You know what though?

2141
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,800
He's spoken into existence,
man.

2142
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:15,700
Yeah.
He wanted to be committed,

2143
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:17,070
became it.
He dead.

2144
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:17,933
Well not probably not what he wanted,
but he did become something in the 

2145
01:27:21,091 --> 01:27:22,650
higher they climb,
the harder they fall.

2146
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:24,870
Very true.
So,

2147
01:27:24,871 --> 01:27:25,740
um,
anyway,

2148
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:26,574
they went and set this whole thing up.
Like he's supposed to go to this 

2149
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:30,870
culinary school and teaching people how 
to make a pizza.

2150
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,880
But it's so obviously fake.
I mean,

2151
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,860
but he has people,
I mean,

2152
01:27:34,861 --> 01:27:35,694
just enjoy this.

2153
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:41,303
Yeah,

2154
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,030
everyone's got paper plates

2155
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:58,770
and the host is just the most flattering
cock sucking judge Jack.

2156
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:05,680
I just got this.
It's,

2157
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,100
it's cannot be overused.
That's incredible.

2158
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:10,410
All right.
I get to the fucking point.

2159
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,283
I liked this.
I liked this part in the show or were 

2160
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:14,754
like already hour and a half in.
So now it's like nobody's really 

2161
01:28:17,071 --> 01:28:17,701
watching.
Yeah.

2162
01:28:17,701 --> 01:28:18,211
Great.
Right.

2163
01:28:18,211 --> 01:28:20,430
So it's like the pressure is really off 
at this point.

2164
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:24,360
This guy's the c o of Secrets of 
Louisville shifts.

2165
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,490
So apparently it's pr.
It's a series

2166
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:40,490
right here.
Is this not like a,

2167
01:28:40,491 --> 01:28:45,100
just like a fever dream does it?
It feels like Tim and Eric.

2168
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:46,210
Yeah,
exactly.

2169
01:28:46,211 --> 01:28:47,710
Yeah.
The mural

2170
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:49,780
and insane in the back.
Hold on you.

2171
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:50,773
He's got a Lav and they don't mute it so
you can hear him making these really 

2172
01:28:54,381 --> 01:28:56,030
weird sounds like he goes like,
whoa.

2173
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,810
And Shit like that,
but we lose it.

2174
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:03,310
Hey,
hmm.

2175
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:07,440
Oh my God.
It was,

2176
01:29:07,441 --> 01:29:09,000
you know,
listen to,

2177
01:29:09,001 --> 01:29:11,030
this shit is incredible.
I somehow,

2178
01:29:11,031 --> 01:29:12,870
I've never made a video about this 
because,

2179
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:13,873
oh,
there's only a few wonderful moments 

2180
01:29:15,631 --> 01:29:17,220
like this,
but the rest is just so boring.

2181
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:17,550
No,
no,

2182
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:18,450
it's not worth it.
No,

2183
01:29:18,451 --> 01:29:20,070
but this is beautiful.
And like 93,000

2184
01:29:20,071 --> 01:29:21,780
is truly under the radar.
Oh yeah.

2185
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:23,260
Oh yeah.
Um,

2186
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:25,080
I'm sure they put a lot of marketing in 
this,

2187
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:26,130
but here,

2188
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,550
oh,
I need to go back one

2189
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:37,870
very exciting what's going on there?
But can we stop for that?

2190
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:45,370
I mean,
he is like the,

2191
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,360
it's,
it's lesson.

2192
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,240
He's Papa John.
Sometimes.

2193
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,700
That's enough.
It wasn't enough.

2194
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:54,623
When was,
it was yesterday and all the shit went 

2195
01:29:55,351 --> 01:29:55,770
down,
right?

2196
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:58,980
Yeah.
It's weird little fucking,

2197
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,570
he's,
the public doesn't ask.

2198
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:02,760
He does not have the best track record.
He,

2199
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:05,880
he was,
when it was in the news first one,

2200
01:30:05,881 --> 01:30:06,714
he was like,
I'm not gonna fucking increase my pizza 

2201
01:30:09,061 --> 01:30:14,061
prices by 1 cent to give my employees 
healthcare because of obamacare.

2202
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:16,470
They were like,
you've cheap fucking right John.

2203
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:17,820
I mean if,
if,

2204
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:20,243
if the CEO's of our pain or celebrity 
ceos of our pizza chain restaurants 

2205
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:26,130
can't survive the current cultural 
moment,

2206
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:29,400
who can,
yeah.

2207
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,490
I feel like I'm next and you know what 
the thing is,

2208
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:34,530
it's like what are we gonna have to get 
into a fucking him or whatever,

2209
01:30:34,531 --> 01:30:37,380
but like we have to take him so 
seriously.

2210
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:39,810
Cause it's like,
it's kind of like he could be president,

2211
01:30:39,811 --> 01:30:41,730
so we just only like literally we have 
to take them seriously.

2212
01:30:41,731 --> 01:30:42,564
But yeah,
we actually have to be worried about 

2213
01:30:43,621 --> 01:30:44,454
this,
that like that's the problem with the 

2214
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:46,980
culture and I want to get into all that 
shit you know?

2215
01:30:46,981 --> 01:30:49,500
Mean.
But like what's insane is that like,

2216
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:50,663
ev,
the entire culture exists on the same 

2217
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:56,850
level and on that same plane and it,
and it mimics our fucking phones.

2218
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,590
It's like you scroll through your 
twitter and you will,

2219
01:30:58,591 --> 01:31:01,230
or your instagram and you will see in no
particular order,

2220
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,900
your mother,
your friend Geico,

2221
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:05,730
the president of the United States,
Kim Kardashians.

2222
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,593
And it's like,
and that's what the national 

2223
01:31:07,441 --> 01:31:08,580
conversation has become.
Like,

2224
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:12,150
it's just all the same.
It's like when Kanye freaked out,

2225
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:12,984
we have to take them seriously.
Cause like w what's the fucking 

2226
01:31:15,331 --> 01:31:16,020
difference there?

2227
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:18,540
There is only one conversation being 
yeah,

2228
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:19,560
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

2229
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:23,820
It's like yeah it kind of like we,
I would just be like yeah fuck this guy.

2230
01:31:23,821 --> 01:31:24,654
But it's like no like we have to 
actually keep an eye on our pizza guys 

2231
01:31:27,601 --> 01:31:30,900
cause they may run the fucking world.
I gets crazy.

2232
01:31:30,901 --> 01:31:32,190
Yeah.
No I think that's true.

2233
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:33,053
Well and similarly he got in trouble 
when he'd said that the NFL people and 

2234
01:31:36,751 --> 01:31:39,300
you stop protesting because it's 
affecting pizza prices.

2235
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:40,853
Did you see it?
That whole thing when the kneeling nfl 

2236
01:31:42,901 --> 01:31:44,580
player are yeah,
nfl.

2237
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:47,970
And he was like listen,
I'm going to pull my sponsors.

2238
01:31:47,971 --> 01:31:48,804
He was like their number one sponsor and
if these guys keeping yelling because 

2239
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:54,300
our pizza sales are down since they 
started protesting,

2240
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:55,163
that's crazy.
And the kneeling thing is like I 

2241
01:31:57,121 --> 01:32:00,460
personally am publicly have,
I've always been like what is it?

2242
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,830
Why do you fucking care?
But also like,

2243
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:03,933
don't we know that like the Department 
of Defense pays like $50 million like 

2244
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,673
that?
All the flag shit is advertisements for 

2245
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:10,984
the military.
The Department of Defense pays the NFL 

2246
01:32:12,491 --> 01:32:13,280
like,
Whoa,

2247
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,113
why pay them to do this?
All the other reuniting troops and 

2248
01:32:16,601 --> 01:32:19,810
stuff,
those are paid paid stage things too.

2249
01:32:19,811 --> 01:32:21,070
That's fuck.
So like,

2250
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:23,860
no wonder they're angry obviously,
because like you're,

2251
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,840
it's not that like you're kneeling 
during the anthem.

2252
01:32:25,841 --> 01:32:26,360
It's like,
no,

2253
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,450
no,
you're kneeling during our ad time.

2254
01:32:28,451 --> 01:32:30,370
Disparaging are,
are,

2255
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,300
no,
this is the answer.

2256
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:32,021
Yeah.
Yeah.

2257
01:32:32,021 --> 01:32:32,830
No,
this is a,

2258
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:36,510
we paid for this shit to be an 
advertisement and your d,

2259
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:37,423
that's a fucking great advertisement.
That is exactly the people that go sign 

2260
01:32:40,571 --> 01:32:42,040
up.
Yeah.

2261
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:44,200
And like,
and like chill,

2262
01:32:44,201 --> 01:32:44,801
whatever.
I mean,

2263
01:32:44,801 --> 01:32:46,950
I think it should be stated.
You mean like I'm saying,

2264
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,540
I don't think whatever does it,
the FCC have rules.

2265
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:52,000
Like I as a youtuber need to disclose 
what I'm sponsored,

2266
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:54,190
the military sponsor of the NFL and 
nobody needs to be like,

2267
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,420
hey,
this is a page.

2268
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,630
This national anthem is a paid 
sponsorship.

2269
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,940
Yeah.
It's slats fucking creepy.

2270
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:01,790
Crazy.
Yeah.

2271
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:02,321
Um,
well,

2272
01:33:02,321 --> 01:33:02,770
yeah,
I mean,

2273
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:03,940
oh,
well let's get them off the field.

2274
01:33:03,941 --> 01:33:04,774
And that case,
I didn't know they were disparaging a 

2275
01:33:06,251 --> 01:33:06,910
sponsor.
Yeah,

2276
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:08,620
exactly.
Now we got a problem.

2277
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:10,230
Yeah,
yeah.

2278
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:13,840
Well anyway,
can we please acknowledge the,

2279
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:16,370
it's too good,
but know,

2280
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:18,880
but that is truly,
that is what I searched for it.

2281
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:21,200
It's like the micro moments of those 
systems,

2282
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:22,083
a beautiful micro moment and boom goes,
the dynamite is so good because it's 

2283
01:33:25,691 --> 01:33:29,740
like it's one after another point that 
very well,

2284
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:33,670
I think it goes the dynamite did he 
coined that?

2285
01:33:33,850 --> 01:33:35,740
I don't know.
It's his now.

2286
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:36,663
I mean if he coined that then,
but that's what's so sad about is he's 

2287
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:40,503
flailing and then in the Lebanese it's 
back to the thing that he wanted to say 

2288
01:33:43,871 --> 01:33:45,620
if it went well,
which is going goes to nine at night.

2289
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:47,980
But yeah,
it's like I said,

2290
01:33:47,981 --> 01:33:49,960
what do you feel for pup right now?
Do you sympathize with them?

2291
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:51,190
No.
Okay.

2292
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,083
No,
no,

2293
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,113
no.
It's like,

2294
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:59,530
try to sympathize with this man.
It's hilarious.

2295
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,950
I just can't believe like,
I just can't believe where the headlines

2296
01:34:02,951 --> 01:34:03,850
look like.
Yeah.

2297
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,740
It's like Papa John,
I'm trying to,

2298
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:06,933
it's crazy droplet Papa John,
drop the n bomb on conference call with 

2299
01:34:11,381 --> 01:34:13,420
the board of directors.
Yeah,

2300
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:14,283
and you're like,
yeah and that should be funny or weird 

2301
01:34:17,561 --> 01:34:18,394
or like I'm saying it should be like 
some weird face off and not look 

2302
01:34:20,981 --> 01:34:23,920
indistinguishable from like geopolitical
headlines.

2303
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,070
I totally hear you.
I think it will be,

2304
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:29,560
I have this problem with twitter news,
which I love twitter news.

2305
01:34:29,561 --> 01:34:30,394
It's almost like,
it's like a fucking ivy of all this 

2306
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:35,110
bullshit right into my vein.
I don't almost use twitter at all.

2307
01:34:35,111 --> 01:34:36,610
Just the news.
Yeah,

2308
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:37,201
sometimes.
Yeah.

2309
01:34:37,201 --> 01:34:38,530
Yeah.
Album is like,

2310
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:43,570
what happened was Shane Dawson,
somebody just added the blue.

2311
01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:44,463
Well what was it?
Then they accused him of being a 

2312
01:34:46,361 --> 01:34:48,200
pedophile or some shit.
What was it?

2313
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,433
But it was just like so unfounded and 
they ran it as this headline and I was 

2314
01:34:54,161 --> 01:34:54,821
like,
damn,

2315
01:34:54,821 --> 01:34:55,990
that shouldn't be,
you know,

2316
01:34:55,991 --> 01:34:56,824
like you said next to,
to the point where he said he was 

2317
01:34:58,491 --> 01:35:00,440
getting like a cost at starbucks and 
stuff.

2318
01:35:00,441 --> 01:35:01,274
Right.
Like just because some asshole blast it 

2319
01:35:03,570 --> 01:35:04,403
on there.

2320
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:11,900
Let's not,
let's not veer off too far,

2321
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:12,763
but no,
but it's incredible to talk about the 

2322
01:35:13,581 --> 01:35:17,860
dangers of the Internet while also 
showcasing them bite during hip saying,

2323
01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:25,400
yeah,
I mean this thing is so fucking awesome.

2324
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:27,530
Look at this.
It's got pictures.

2325
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,640
Yeah.
I'm very excited about that.

2326
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,060
And you can customize it.
I've got another one.

2327
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,600
I mean we,
I mean this is just the beginning,

2328
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:38,420
like,
yeah,

2329
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:40,630
I'm gonna have a lot of fun with it.
I get,

2330
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:41,690
I get this for you.
Want to do it.

2331
01:35:41,691 --> 01:35:42,670
Okay,
cool.

2332
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:44,600
Enjoy.
Um,

2333
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:45,770
so,
um,

2334
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:48,520
let's,
let's venture forth bravely if,

2335
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:49,790
if we may,
oh,

2336
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:51,320
we're doing this still.
Yeah.

2337
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:53,390
Okay.
This is why I brought you here.

2338
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:58,010
You want to talk about your movie gone 
clearly,

2339
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,130
but the pizzas fucking good.
Like you could say,

2340
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:01,911
oh,
oh,

2341
01:36:01,911 --> 01:36:05,720
wagner was a Nazi.
You could bog and it was a Nazi,

2342
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:09,860
but like his music was pretty Dang.
Dang is the word.

2343
01:36:09,861 --> 01:36:11,450
I think he was hoping people would think
it was.

2344
01:36:11,451 --> 01:36:12,171
Dang.
Yeah.

2345
01:36:12,171 --> 01:36:12,921
I mean it's,
you know,

2346
01:36:12,921 --> 01:36:17,060
the chick filet thing,
it's like those sandwiches pretty good.

2347
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:17,913
Pretty fucking.
Dang.

2348
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,393
Well that's the conversation.
Can we separate the art from the pizza 

2349
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:26,360
mogul?
Can we separate the two?

2350
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:31,490
The garlic sauce from the what looks 
like water logged young vampire,

2351
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:32,443
right?
Yeah.

2352
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:34,110
Yeah.
That's a good description.

2353
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:35,990
I like that.
Some stuff,

2354
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:41,390
some rumor that the garlic sauce is the 
secret of,

2355
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:45,200
of of his loss of his long life.
Is that right?

2356
01:36:45,201 --> 01:36:47,040
Yeah,
it's like a slight more,

2357
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:49,610
it's probably quite the opposite for 
everyone else.

2358
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,830
You think he's,
he doesn't drink that garlic sauce.

2359
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:54,260
I drink it.
You do fucking,

2360
01:36:54,261 --> 01:36:56,210
I throw the pizza out.
I drink that shit.

2361
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:59,600
No you don't.
They're in school.

2362
01:36:59,601 --> 01:37:01,860
I used to need in that in school we used
to,

2363
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:02,713
um,
I get like fifth grade we would line up 

2364
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:09,251
shots of a Russian dressing,
like we do dress.

2365
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:12,530
Did you like the dressing or was it 
meant to be gross?

2366
01:37:12,531 --> 01:37:14,340
It was like at that age where it's like 
there's no,

2367
01:37:14,341 --> 01:37:17,090
you're not doing drugs and stuff,
so you're like getting it to cassie.

2368
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,250
Yeah.
Gimme like sweet or there was one friend

2369
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:21,530
we used to pay to eat anything weird 
like,

2370
01:37:21,531 --> 01:37:24,380
and he was up for anything that reminds 
me of that.

2371
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:26,630
Ethan.
Any fucking thing I'm telling you,

2372
01:37:26,631 --> 01:37:29,840
Bro?
Hair really dog shit.

2373
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:33,780
Okay.

2374
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:36,150
Anything wait,
he aided dollar or four.

2375
01:37:36,151 --> 01:37:37,030
$1.
Okay.

2376
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:37,610
Okay.

2377
01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:40,220
I'll give you a $1 eight a dollar.
I thought you were trying to get worse.

2378
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:41,660
Come and do you need anything?
Hair.

2379
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,610
Shit.
A dollar.

2380
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:45,680
Well,
to be frank,

2381
01:37:45,681 --> 01:37:47,750
that may be the grossest one.
Yeah.

2382
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:48,723
Who?
Dollar earners.

2383
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:51,080
I had friends.
These do poo dollar.

2384
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,360
Oh,
was that you put poo on a dollar and you

2385
01:37:53,361 --> 01:37:56,010
leave it outside like Oh yes.
And was like a dollar.

2386
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:57,390
Yeah.
And then there's the shit on it,

2387
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,130
but it's like,
it was a lot of jackass.

2388
01:37:59,131 --> 01:38:02,880
That was a big part of my childhood.
I met Cityville sweet guy.

2389
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:03,883
Oh,
he was on here.

2390
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:04,740
Oh,
I was like,

2391
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:05,620
he's really cool.
Okay.

2392
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:06,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

2393
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:08,790
They were important.
I agree.

2394
01:38:09,470 --> 01:38:11,730
Um,
as important as papa.

2395
01:38:12,730 --> 01:38:13,563
MMM,

2396
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:17,903
thanks.

2397
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,940
That was another one.
That was a different one.

2398
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:31,250
It's so loud.
All these experts in culinary.

2399
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:37,673
All right.
Don't act like you didn't pay everyone 

2400
01:38:38,231 --> 01:38:39,130
to be here.
You fucking,

2401
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,700
I'm very proud to be here in this 
advertisement I paid for.

2402
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:48,130
And the racism in Hind sight is pretty,
is there is a good old boy.

2403
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:49,173
Yeah.
And all the ways that a good old boy as 

2404
01:38:50,951 --> 01:38:53,830
a good way,
but also just like the mural.

2405
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,810
I don't really,
the mural is killing me.

2406
01:38:55,811 --> 01:38:57,670
These giant onions.
Yeah.

2407
01:38:57,820 --> 01:39:00,520
The harvest.
The bouncy was sweet this year,

2408
01:39:00,580 --> 01:39:02,590
Papa.
And just like the sharp,

2409
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,390
who do you think,
who do you think pick those.

2410
01:39:04,391 --> 01:39:05,224
Let me just put it that way.
On Papa's a plantation pass look at is 

2411
01:39:12,461 --> 01:39:15,610
three Oh nine one 53 down.
Alright.

2412
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:16,090
Alright.
Bye.

2413
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:16,600
Anyway,
this,

2414
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:19,060
this isn't why we're here.
Are you?

2415
01:39:19,061 --> 01:39:21,190
I'm out of water and can I,
can I get a glass,

2416
01:39:21,191 --> 01:39:24,730
a little reader though?
Can we get a refill for Christ's sake?

2417
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:27,700
Thank you.
So this is really the,

2418
01:39:27,701 --> 01:39:30,580
uh,
the Croup de Gras.

2419
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:32,110
Is that how you sat?
Right?

2420
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:35,260
Coupe de Gras.
Can this be a coup de Gras?

2421
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,600
This video?
No,

2422
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:38,760
I don't think so.
Me Tell.

2423
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:39,613
It just looks confused.
I don't know if that is what does the 

2424
01:39:40,651 --> 01:39:42,210
coup de Gras,
it's like the,

2425
01:39:42,430 --> 01:39:44,260
it's like the,
the final blow.

2426
01:39:44,261 --> 01:39:45,250
Yeah,
the final blow.

2427
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:46,290
Yeah.

2428
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:47,420
Thank you.
Yay.

2429
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:51,340
Um,
I'm waiting for God.

2430
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:53,700
He's the worst.
It's all good.

2431
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:54,593
Hey,
good guys and the intern now he's the 

2432
01:39:55,741 --> 01:39:56,470
worst.
You don't know him.

2433
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:57,303
I don't say that.
You don't know him like you're just 

2434
01:39:58,801 --> 01:40:00,090
being nice.
Don't do it.

2435
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:01,860
Thanks you.
And you're the best.

2436
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:05,160
Appreciate you.
And you've got the bottoms of that track

2437
01:40:05,161 --> 01:40:06,340
suit.
Yes.

2438
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,180
Oh,
is that good or bad?

2439
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:12,390
I don't know.
Some telling you,

2440
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:13,523
but he's not wearing them.
You don't like the whole Adidas track 

2441
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:17,220
suit?
Look note on him.

2442
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,260
I'm on board now,
Dude.

2443
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:22,800
Fuck that guy.
Alright,

2444
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:26,160
so this is in its entirety,
this beautiful,

2445
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,113
wonderful advertisement that Papa John 
made with his son as paper helper and 

2446
01:40:30,271 --> 01:40:34,880
his best friend Beau,
to celebrate their Papa john.com.

2447
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:39,890
Come in live 2010 and this is the title 
they used.

2448
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:44,010
This isn't someone else.
They put this here popping son.

2449
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:46,250
First order on the new Papa john.com.
Okay?

2450
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:47,310
Okay.
All right.

2451
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:55,000
Okay,
welcome to [inaudible].

2452
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,580
Now the first thing I already love about
this is like,

2453
01:40:58,210 --> 01:41:01,810
I'm so relatable and behind me is a 
muzzle Liam.

2454
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:02,693
Yeah.
It's like a fucking huge statue of an 

2455
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:05,530
eagle.
Yeah.

2456
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:06,460
Yeah.
It's crazy.

2457
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,500
I love it.
Also,

2458
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:12,450
if he's gets a wedding ring is,
that'd be the thing is it's glyphic Oh,

2459
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:13,540
a lot.
Yeah.

2460
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,033
Yeah.
A lot of pizza's been sold to them by 

2461
01:41:17,141 --> 01:41:17,974
that.
I'll say just cruising around in his 

2462
01:41:19,001 --> 01:41:19,691
papa John.
Sure.

2463
01:41:19,691 --> 01:41:21,220
Like this is how I hang out at home.
Yeah,

2464
01:41:21,221 --> 01:41:22,180
that's crazy.
The low,

2465
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:25,720
the untuck long sleeve.
The Long Sleeve Collard,

2466
01:41:25,721 --> 01:41:28,660
Papa John's shirt.
I love the idea of him just wearing that

2467
01:41:28,661 --> 01:41:29,494
every day at home.
It projects business yet casual rolled 

2468
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:34,060
up sleeves are worker.
Um,

2469
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:35,080
you know,
I was just,

2470
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:39,070
you know,
digging one of my maid's graves.

2471
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:39,790
Oh,
hey there.

2472
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:40,571
Yeah.
Oh,

2473
01:41:40,571 --> 01:41:43,450
you caught me.
I was just dedicated grave for one of my

2474
01:41:43,451 --> 01:41:44,290
fallen maids.

2475
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:50,860
The secret ingredient.
That's a good one,

2476
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:53,293
bro.
Did you really have to do this at your 

2477
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:55,660
fucking house?
Here's the steeple.

2478
01:41:55,661 --> 01:41:57,040
Open the doors.
No Jews.

2479
01:41:58,510 --> 01:41:59,900
No Jews.
That's Papa Johns.

2480
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,630
Papa Johns.
What was that?

2481
01:42:01,631 --> 01:42:03,210
Was that one of the old school 
playground thing?

2482
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:04,661
Here's,
Oh,

2483
01:42:04,661 --> 01:42:06,520
of course you don't know this.
Here's the church.

2484
01:42:06,521 --> 01:42:08,170
Here's the steeple.
Open the doors.

2485
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:12,040
Look at all the people.
No choose allows a twist.

2486
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:13,500
No,
it's not a twist.

2487
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:13,870
It's like,
oh,

2488
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:14,703
they used to say that back in 2010 
people say that about Jews to know that 

2489
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:20,460
he little.
No,

2490
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:21,293
no Jews.

2491
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,113
I feel like he should have done this 
somewhere else as all like you have a 

2492
01:42:27,371 --> 01:42:30,370
fucking dragon in your hall and like 
made of gold in your hallway.

2493
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:32,990
Like,
wait,

2494
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:34,930
what is that?
Well,

2495
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,240
it looks like a,
it's something.

2496
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:40,270
Let's get it looks like a guera dose.
It's hard to tell man.

2497
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:42,310
Is that a mythical creature?
No,

2498
01:42:42,311 --> 01:42:45,970
it's w what magic harp evolves into.
Oh yeah.

2499
01:42:45,971 --> 01:42:47,620
That's a mythical creature.
Don't say now.

2500
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:50,860
Can you imagine he had a pokemon statue?
It's not a myth.

2501
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:55,900
Pokemon sign methods only.
I wish so much that pokemon was real and

2502
01:42:56,461 --> 01:42:57,850
when I was a kid,
oh my God.

2503
01:42:57,851 --> 01:43:00,730
Dude was like snapping man.
It was where it was at.

2504
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:03,280
I didn't play snap and that was the bast
y.

2505
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:04,750
What was snapped?
The picture?

2506
01:43:04,751 --> 01:43:06,530
One rent.
Oh,

2507
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:07,690
the one to take pictures.
I don't,

2508
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:09,190
it was like perfect.
It was crazy.

2509
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:11,770
For 64 I'm waiting for pokemon on the 
switch,

2510
01:43:11,771 --> 01:43:12,604
man.
I can't fucking wait for three D 

2511
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:14,550
pokemon.
Ooh,

2512
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:16,900
I'm not greedy.
Yeah,

2513
01:43:16,901 --> 01:43:18,510
well you know like,
oh yeah,

2514
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:19,900

Ya know what?

2515
01:43:19,901 --> 01:43:21,750
I'm so talk,

2516
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:24,180
I'm saying fucking hell.

2517
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:36,520
So relatable,
man.

2518
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:38,850
So glad you did it in your fucking 
house.

2519
01:43:38,851 --> 01:43:40,440
Like why did you do this in your house?
Do it.

2520
01:43:40,441 --> 01:43:45,060
Had a pizza store.
He's almost like he's flexing on us.

2521
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:46,620
Yeah,
it's a lot.

2522
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:49,170
It is to grow up.
I have,

2523
01:43:49,171 --> 01:43:51,560
I feel both.
I feel for this kid.

2524
01:43:51,561 --> 01:43:52,394
He's like,
yeah,

2525
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:54,350
well you can see the deadness in his 
eyes.

2526
01:43:54,351 --> 01:43:59,351
I mean here.
Yeah,

2527
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:04,170
port bow.
He still hasn't gotten over.

2528
01:44:04,171 --> 01:44:05,850
This blows the house.
Oh,

2529
01:44:05,851 --> 01:44:07,320
that's so sad.
Yeah,

2530
01:44:07,321 --> 01:44:08,154

2531

the baggy shirts.

2533
01:44:12,551 --> 01:44:15,580
Not High in the bow.
In the house.

2534
01:44:15,730 --> 01:44:20,020
Post the weakest hands in the air.
It's like the damn how old?

2535
01:44:20,021 --> 01:44:21,220
It's a weight.
That kids,

2536
01:44:21,221 --> 01:44:26,221
what I will say,
he's probably 12 or 13 so he's 20 now.

2537
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:28,240
Yeah.
But if you're out there,

2538
01:44:28,241 --> 01:44:29,860
dude,
I love you.

2539
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:32,530
We forgive you.
Your dad made bomb ass pizzas but you do

2540
01:44:32,531 --> 01:44:35,140
not have to be what he is.
I mean,

2541
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:36,003
I hope you make pizzas.
I hope you carry on that family legacy 

2542
01:44:37,871 --> 01:44:40,090
because that is a valuable,
I like the pizzas.

2543
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:42,190
Yeah.
Maybe you should start bows pizza.

2544
01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:47,370
Yeah.
A boat shed himself of the hall.

2545
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:48,850
You're going to have to change the 
spelling though.

2546
01:44:48,851 --> 01:44:50,110
Cause people won't relate to that.
Yeah.

2547
01:44:50,111 --> 01:44:51,730
You don't have to live in the shadow of 
your father.

2548
01:44:51,731 --> 01:44:54,430
You can do your own pizza thing.

2549
01:44:54,430 --> 01:44:55,570
Yeah.
Not Anything.

2550
01:44:55,950 --> 01:44:56,783
Yes you can do.
I was afraid you were going to say you 

2551
01:44:57,491 --> 01:44:58,330
can do any,
no,

2552
01:44:58,331 --> 01:44:59,164
no.
You can do anything in the pizza 

2553
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:02,980
industry world.
The world's your gem.

2554
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:03,993
This is like foxcatcher.
Have you seen foxcatcher [inaudible] 

2555
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:07,460
this is like what I wish foxcatcher 
well,

2556
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:09,070
I mean,

2557
01:45:09,071 --> 01:45:09,910

2561
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:20,043

It's like a documentary at the movies 

2562
01:45:22,991 --> 01:45:24,910
with Steve Corel and channing tatum and 
Mark Rufallo.

2563
01:45:24,911 --> 01:45:27,040
It's incredible.
It's so weird and amazing,

2564
01:45:27,570 --> 01:45:28,600

2565
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:30,233

What's this whole

2569
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:49,980

It's like,

2570
01:45:49,981 --> 01:45:52,470
they're like,
we need a family angle on this.

2571
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:53,490
I get to do with you.
You know,

2572
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:54,660
after this camera goes off,
he's like,

2573
01:45:54,661 --> 01:45:55,770
fuck you dad.
Yeah,

2574
01:45:55,771 --> 01:45:57,510
of course.
I don't know.

2575
01:45:57,511 --> 01:45:59,610
You know what though?
I don't know if they love each other.

2576
01:46:01,290 --> 01:46:04,110
I mean,
I think bose genuine.

2577
01:46:04,111 --> 01:46:06,780
I think he's a real dude.
And really in this moment,

2578
01:46:06,781 --> 01:46:08,400
you think he's being real well here,

2579
01:46:11,630 --> 01:46:12,463

2580
01:46:18,850 --> 01:46:20,760

He's got all the moves.

2581
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:24,960
I'm just waiting for the thunder to 
settle.

2582
01:46:25,110 --> 01:46:27,030
Okay.

2583
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:28,043

2584
01:46:29,581 --> 01:46:30,540

Yeah.

2585
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:33,780
Yeah.
I'm anxious all the time and uh,

2586
01:46:34,410 --> 01:46:36,030
I prefer a little caesars,
frankly.

2587
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:44,670
Uh Huh.
Call Him Jalapenos.

2588
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:47,673
To be frank with you.
I know it's Jalapeno and ever since was 

2589
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,040
a hell of what?
Yeah,

2590
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,940
how a peanut,
that's what he said.

2591
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:54,690
Right,
right.

2592
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:55,870
I know.
Talapin Yo,

2593
01:46:56,790 --> 01:47:01,030

It's that all the yet I know that.

2594
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:03,360
I know that.
I know what the double l means.

2595
01:47:03,361 --> 01:47:07,930
Can I say that?
Double l Jalapeno,

2596
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:10,210
the double a mix.
A Y sound.

2597
01:47:11,150 --> 01:47:13,580
Are we confused?
Is there two l's and Jalapeno?

2598
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:18,580
Oh my God.
I don't think there are.

2599
01:47:18,581 --> 01:47:19,780
Right.
Okay.

2600
01:47:19,810 --> 01:47:21,760
The point is let's,
let's go.

2601
01:47:21,790 --> 01:47:23,300
Let's,
let's rewind this.

2602
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:27,250
It's not Michael Peanut Ania yet.
Hold on.

2603
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:30,400
Let's rewind this anytime I sound like 
an idiot.

2604
01:47:30,401 --> 01:47:31,540
I go,
I'm dyslexic,

2605
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:36,730
but by the point I want it to be 
successful with a learning disability.

2606
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:38,630
I was looking,
I'm kidding.

2607
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:40,030
You can have it.
You can be,

2608
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:41,790
you can be successful with a learning 
disability.

2609
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:46,830
This jess ask Mozart Einstein.
Exactly.

2610
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:49,590
He was asperger.
He,

2611
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:51,680
he had asperger's.
He was an ass.

2612
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:54,040
I thought that that's how it was.
Said No.

2613
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,730
Um,
I know that it's Jalapeno.

2614
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:00,790
Jalapeno Jalapeno.
Okay.

2615
01:48:00,791 --> 01:48:03,010
Jalapeno.
I know it was something like that.

2616
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:05,360
Okay,
but once I watched the video,

2617
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:08,120
you didn't Jalapeno.
Am I getting it?

2618
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:09,970
Am I okay?
My passing the test.

2619
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:12,690
A sea cow.
Wow.

2620
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:14,813
I'm sorry.
I'll stop.

2621
01:48:15,190 --> 01:48:17,710
No,
please write that button to Valhalla.

2622
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:20,980
Um,
but once I watched this,

2623
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:23,350
I started saying how a Pena and I 
couldn't stop.

2624
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:27,310
Yes.
And it's actually a problem.

2625
01:48:27,370 --> 01:48:30,650
I call it a Jalapeno now it's all so 
like who,

2626
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:31,780
you know,
whatever.

2627
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:33,071
Yeah,
we could,

2628
01:48:33,071 --> 01:48:38,071
we could end it there.
I'm saying we're mostly white and yeah,

2629
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:40,210
silver Butrans,
you know what I mean?

2630
01:48:40,211 --> 01:48:43,390
We're doing croissant and we can have 
our way,

2631
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:44,283
whatever.
You don't have our way,

2632
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,120
but like when it,
when,

2633
01:48:46,121 --> 01:48:46,954
when like when,
when the late lane white person like 

2634
01:48:49,630 --> 01:48:51,290
overreaches too,
that's all we,

2635
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:52,630
that's,
that's also like,

2636
01:48:52,690 --> 01:48:54,370
you know,
just normal.

2637
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:56,200
It's like all good or well it's weird 
when they go,

2638
01:48:56,201 --> 01:48:58,120
like when they go like a heat dad,
it's just like,

2639
01:48:58,180 --> 01:48:59,350
oh yeah,
what do you think you are?

2640
01:48:59,351 --> 01:49:02,530
You're my dad does that all the time.
Do when we go to Mexican restaurants?

2641
01:49:02,531 --> 01:49:04,780
Yeah.
He starts doing like jive with the,

2642
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:06,610
with the Mexican waiters.

2643
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:08,770
It's like speaking fucked up Spanish to 
them.

2644
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:09,371
Right.
I'm like,

2645
01:49:09,371 --> 01:49:11,410
Dude,
how do you even know they speak Spanish?

2646
01:49:11,411 --> 01:49:12,244
They're probably American,
but maybe it's respect cause I was just 

2647
01:49:13,871 --> 01:49:14,710
thinking.
I don't know.

2648
01:49:14,711 --> 01:49:15,220
It can,
yeah,

2649
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:16,053
you're saying it.
I'm saying I if like if I can find it 

2650
01:49:18,851 --> 01:49:19,684
embarrassing.
I'm saying with some like Chinese guy 

2651
01:49:20,951 --> 01:49:22,660
came over and was like,
hamburger.

2652
01:49:22,661 --> 01:49:23,620
I'd be like,
I'd be like,

2653
01:49:23,621 --> 01:49:24,820
thanks.
I don't know.

2654
01:49:24,821 --> 01:49:27,130
So maybe it's cool.
Well thanks for being thoughtful.

2655
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:29,030
Hey,
look at me like a hamburger.

2656
01:49:29,031 --> 01:49:29,864
That's a very funny thing is actually in
Sweden they did a show where they like 

2657
01:49:33,610 --> 01:49:36,070
speaking in,
they're doing the equivalent of like for

2658
01:49:36,071 --> 01:49:36,904
Swedish,
we'd be like,

2659
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:37,743
oh,
when we were like Walter Walter Walter 

2660
01:49:38,651 --> 01:49:41,350
Boards or whatever,
and they do it for a English.

2661
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:42,610
They don't,
they're not speaking English,

2662
01:49:42,611 --> 01:49:43,444
but what English is that correct to them
and it's a bunch of people going like a 

2663
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:49,140
hurt,
a corrupt [inaudible] subpar.

2664
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:51,430
Ralph had read to total Achara.
Right.

2665
01:49:51,431 --> 01:49:52,690
I guess that's what it sounds like to 
them.

2666
01:49:52,691 --> 01:49:55,230
It's all like our base shinder grade.
Yeah.

2667
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:58,540
That's a good one to look up,
but also if you are a minority,

2668
01:49:58,541 --> 01:50:01,000
please hit them with those hard r's next
time you see me.

2669
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:02,890
Yeah.
It'll be very respectful.

2670
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:04,560
Well,
I can't,

2671
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:05,720
Hi John.
Hit that harder.

2672
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:09,220
Yeah,
he hit that are a little too hard.

2673
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:11,570
Don't hit it that hard.
Don't ever hit that one.

2674
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:13,900
Um,
but I can't,

2675
01:50:13,901 --> 01:50:14,734
I can't really tell if it's respectful 
or embarrassing to like speak fucked up 

2676
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:20,740
Spanish to somebody.
You know,

2677
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:21,360
I,
I,

2678
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,770
you know that maybe my dad.
Yeah,

2679
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,080
that's probably low over your dad.
No,

2680
01:50:26,081 --> 01:50:27,430
because like,
I know people that are fluent,

2681
01:50:27,431 --> 01:50:28,330
they're like,
of course,

2682
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,250
no,
but everything he does embarrass me,

2683
01:50:30,251 --> 01:50:31,084
you know?
And I'm,

2684
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:35,500
I'm like a grown man and he's still is 
capable of embarrassing me.

2685
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:38,260
So brutally.
Did I hold my head in shame?

2686
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:39,760
Yeah.
That's part of the power.

2687
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:41,500
The Dad's wheeled.
It's beautiful though.

2688
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:42,490
Yeah.
That's the job.

2689
01:50:42,491 --> 01:50:43,420
That's the job.
Yeah.

2690
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:44,440
Yeah.
Okay.

2691
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:46,360
Well regardless,
we are,

2692
01:50:46,450 --> 01:50:48,910
we,
we were flying through them.

2693
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:51,450
We really got to push it like this.
Yeah.

2694
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:00,963
You fucking idiot.
Why would you even admit that it's not 

2695
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:06,490
endearing?
He thought it was endearing.

2696
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:08,980
You know,
I've never been on the Internet before.

2697
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:11,063
Is that right?
Is that what laptops looked like eight 

2698
01:51:12,671 --> 01:51:17,140
years ago?
Eight years like Dell that you'd like,

2699
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:20,050
this is really a time capsule of like 
eight years,

2700
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:21,160
eight short years.
He was,

2701
01:51:21,161 --> 01:51:23,830
the chairs looked like back then rich.
Right.

2702
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:26,740
People were living in castles back then.
Wow.

2703
01:51:26,741 --> 01:51:27,574
Things were much better.
Where are the bone chilling where all 

2704
01:51:37,091 --> 01:51:39,640
those sounds that we know he makes,
I wish we had the hose on them.

2705
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,070
I need those.
Damn,

2706
01:51:42,071 --> 01:51:43,210
we're going to have to sound bite those.

2707
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:47,263
Okay.
It seemed to really have endured some 

2708
01:51:51,781 --> 01:51:52,614
heat on that

2709
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:59,450
couple of Saudi pups.
Oh,

2710
01:51:59,451 --> 01:52:00,840
we need to sound bites.
Saudi pops.

2711
01:52:00,841 --> 01:52:02,240
So I again,
I hurt.

2712
01:52:02,241 --> 01:52:05,480
I've watched this video and I can't stop
saying Saudi pops now.

2713
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:08,360
Yeah.
Sodie pop story,

2714
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:11,810
which is so good and it's cute.
So good.

2715
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:15,080
It is cute.
It's sweet thing.

2716
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:23,150
Oh,
there was a little full pod there.

2717
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:25,790
There was a little mess up there and I 
haven't noticed before.

2718
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:34,410
Okay.
Yeah,

2719
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:36,140
I thought it was someone off screen and 
being like,

2720
01:52:36,141 --> 01:52:36,990
all right.
Okay,

2721
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:38,910
so we're okay.

2722
01:52:41,150 --> 01:52:41,983
Great.

2723
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:50,430
Oh wait,
you were actually,

2724
01:52:51,210 --> 01:52:51,691
I was like,
well,

2725
01:52:51,691 --> 01:52:52,620
I don't remember it being there.

2726
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:57,073
Okay.

2727
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:59,630
There's really not much to say at this 
point.

2728
01:52:59,631 --> 01:53:00,530
I feel like,
uh,

2729
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,550
just a couple of old good old boys 
ordering it.

2730
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:06,460
Bye.
Oh here.

2731
01:53:06,461 --> 01:53:10,930
This is great.
This is nailed.

2732
01:53:10,931 --> 01:53:15,931
That one.
I Love Matt.

2733
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:20,230
Loved Matt while look at Matt.

2734
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:29,040
You know what Matt is real mad is real.
Oh yeah.

2735
01:53:29,070 --> 01:53:29,903
No,
Matt didn't even know they were 

2736
01:53:30,221 --> 01:53:33,750
shooting.
You really tell it like it is real.

2737
01:53:34,470 --> 01:53:36,810
That's why I love math so much.
And here's this point where Papa,

2738
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,000
he needs to point out.
Here you can see,

2739
01:53:40,930 --> 01:53:43,240
gave you a tip.
Big 10.

2740
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:47,750
Nice boat.
You'd get it dude.

2741
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:50,150
I was like,
Dad,

2742
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:52,570
I feel a kinship with this kid.
You liked the most dad,

2743
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:53,930
the business.
You know what I mean?

2744
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:54,860
Yeah.
He's a,

2745
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:57,880
he's got this sweet ass like you know,
sort of straight.

2746
01:53:58,060 --> 01:53:59,510
Yeah.
He's got this thing.

2747
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:02,890
I feel good.
You are go.

2748
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:07,430
All right,
so here,

2749
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:09,620
I want to wrap it up with this beautiful
last moment here.

2750
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:16,080
Matt,
you made history today.

2751
01:54:16,081 --> 01:54:21,081
God dammit.
Good Job Matt.

2752
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:24,750
You're the greatest man

2753
01:54:28,370 --> 01:54:30,710
and as a prize you get to fuck my wife 
in front of me.

2754
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:34,430
You think he let Matt in?
He's got that vibe.

2755
01:54:34,431 --> 01:54:38,270
He's going to cook couple days.
Literally.

2756
01:54:38,430 --> 01:54:40,730
We can't even say cuckolding anymore 
because now it's got political.

2757
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:42,110
Oh,
that's true.

2758
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:45,110
It's kind of lost all meaning.
Well that was it.

2759
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:46,100
That's all I have

2760
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:48,970
bro.
I a lot of fun.

2761
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,860
Thanks for being here.
It was,

2762
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:52,843
it was really an honor and a pleasure to
meet you and hang out with Dka and be 

2763
01:54:57,261 --> 01:54:59,210
part of this.
I've been gone a long time.

2764
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:03,590
Viewer first time B are here.
That's insane that you wash your stuff.

2765
01:55:03,591 --> 01:55:04,460
Thank you.
And I want it.

2766
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:05,683
Well,
you're doing good work and I appreciate 

2767
01:55:06,621 --> 01:55:07,630
it and like,
um,

2768
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:08,720
thanks.
A lot of other people do.

2769
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:11,690
And the girl in the movie is a huge fan 
of yours.

2770
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:14,500
So excited.
I loved her.

2771
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:15,261
So,
so excited.

2772
01:55:15,261 --> 01:55:18,110
Can I do to like show her appreciation?
I don't know.

2773
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:20,270
Just she,
she just hearing this.

2774
01:55:20,271 --> 01:55:21,260
She'll be,
she's amazing.

2775
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:22,880
I love her Elsie Fisher.
She's great.

2776
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:24,313
If you're in New York or La,
I see the movie and it will be other 

2777
01:55:25,971 --> 01:55:26,721
places,
uh,

2778
01:55:26,721 --> 01:55:27,800
other,
other times,

2779
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:32,570
99% on rotten tomatoes.
This movie is a heartwarming,

2780
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:35,540
it's wholesome.
It's all fucking romp.

2781
01:55:35,690 --> 01:55:38,060
It's a beautiful,
a little slice of life.

2782
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:39,051
It's,
it's going to,

2783
01:55:39,051 --> 01:55:39,884
you're going to love it and you're going
to leave thinking about it and the best 

2784
01:55:42,231 --> 01:55:43,710
way possible.
Can I say that?

2785
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:46,920
You just said it.
I said I didn't need permission.

2786
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:48,301
Thank you,
Ethan.

2787
01:55:48,301 --> 01:55:49,134
Please go see eighth grade.
It's going to be out nationwide in two 

2788
01:55:52,261 --> 01:55:54,270
weeks.
And thank you so much beau.

2789
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:57,660
You can see it in New York and La,
but it's kind of hard.

2790
01:55:57,750 --> 01:55:58,600
Thank you for having me.
It,

2791
01:55:58,601 --> 01:56:01,080
it's kind of hard to catch.
It's in select select theaters.

2792
01:56:01,110 --> 01:56:02,100
Yeah.
You know,

2793
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:03,060
catch it.
If you can,

2794
01:56:03,061 --> 01:56:06,650
it'll be like 10 more cities next 
weekend and then everywhere that weekend

2795
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:08,250
after everywhere.
Everywhere,

2796
01:56:08,251 --> 01:56:09,060
baby.
Right.

2797
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:11,940
Thank you Beau.
Thank you guys for watching.

2798
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:13,023
Uh,

01:56:17,490 --> 01:56:18,720
Thanks everybody.
