1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,160
Welcome up.
My Dude's,

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,140
my doggies and Micah z boys to the 
Gazebo only zone.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,380
I am your host,
Ethan Klein.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,590
I am sick as a dog.
This is my beautiful pregnant wife who I

5
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:22,770
love and adore.
She's the angel of my life and the light

6
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,560
of my life.
She's everything that I've ever hoped to

7
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:27,270
find in a partner.
And so much more.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,890
We look like I am so sick.
I'm delirious.

9
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:32,880
I'm out of it.
You know,

10
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:34,640
you're still embarrassed by my 
introduction,

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,270
I say,
but it's true.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,560
It's all true and so much more.
I am so sick.

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,423
I am completely out of it.
I've been pumped with all the quills 

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,360
that they quills the night quells the a 
twilight quills.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,060
What do you get when you combine NYQUIL 
and dayquil?

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,040
I'm in the twilight well right now and 
um,

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,200
started wiccan coil.
Oh hell yeah.

18
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:03,090
After today I'm going to be weekend 
quilt out.

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,870
Oh,
and thank you to our sponsors,

20
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:05,730
Audubon,
Mandy's,

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,980
linkedin.
Almost forgot about those great dudes.

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,770
Um,
I am so out of it.

23
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,360
So this is going to be a roller coaster 
ride.

24
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:13,194
Guys.
Thank you for joining us on this 

25
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,110
beautiful,
blessed at Friday.

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,320
Oh right.
Don't we all love it so much.

27
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,390
Yes.
I'm happy to share this special day with

28
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,460
you all.
Um,

29
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:27,750
we had Tom Segura and Christina P,
two of my favorite people on the planet.

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,640
We're scheduled with her on Wednesday.
I was sick.

31
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,503
Unfortunately.
We're going to get him back on here 

32
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,090
soon,
but I love those guys.

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,200
Went to Disney yesterday with my family,
which made my illness worse.

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,693
So,
um,

35
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,563
but you know what,
that's enough about what's going on in 

36
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,684
my life.
Let's get to the science of why we're 

37
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:47,760
all here today,
last week.

38
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,283
And it's been part of the show mythology
I would say is we have these twitter 

39
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:54,840
polls,
which really illuminating,

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,920
I would say some of the darker parts of 
our society.

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,470
Not Dark and the sense of being,
um,

42
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,130
being unethical or something to be 
feared.

43
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:05,964
But I'm on dark in the shadows,
in the shadows in that it hasn't yet 

44
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,450
been uncovered or looked at.
We are,

45
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,493
we are great searchers.
We just great discovers we are 

46
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,810
pranksters.
Do like social experiments.

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,000
This is real shit.
I wouldn't do it.

48
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,933
I wouldn't be surprised to see some of 
these twitter polls being quoted and 

49
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,043
such reputable articles as wikipedia.
So we had one last week about do you 

50
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,090
smell on your hand and you fart on your 
hand and smell it.

51
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,650
I'm so out of it.

52
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,200
Do you fart on your hand and smell it?
So first we did.

53
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:52,800
Do you like the smell of your own farts 
and most overwhelming,

54
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,820
obviously.
Yes.

55
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:54,654
And there were some naysayers like I got
kind of upset because I feel you're 

56
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,270
kidding,
but you're saying that you're serious,

57
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,560
but it's like you're kidding.
Well,

58
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:06,010
the Paul speaks for itself.
So first of all,

59
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,560
there was some disbelief that people 
liked the smell of their own farts.

60
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,180
But then we took it a step further.
We said,

61
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,313
do you fart on your hand and smell it?
And most of the people in here except 

62
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,680
for Zack is the only honest being here 
was like,

63
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,550
what is wrong with you?
They say,

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,680
they say,
Ethan,

65
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,310
you are.
You shouldn't exist.

66
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,144
They say to me,
so let's go to this pole because this 

67
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,044
was a prolific vote.
I would say this was a paramount 

68
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,960
benchmark vault we took place here.

69
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,020
Have you ever smart farted on your hand 
and smelled it?

70
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,050
124,000
votes.

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,390
That is a huge number.
And let me say 51%.

72
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,120
Yes.
And after this poll,

73
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:49,954
I bet you it's going to go even higher.
We even saw a capo on when we were at 

74
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:58,360
Disneyland and the guy had to tell me 
that he does it too.

75
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,550
Yeah.
And actually it was golf and I said,

76
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:03,720
can I smell your hand?
Lenny Snooze,

77
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,563
I sniffed his hand.
He had a Turkey leg in it and it was a 

78
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,460
fart in a curriculum.
It was a great time.

79
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,370
We had their Disneyland.
Um,

80
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,950
um,
so there you have it guys.

81
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,440
This is science.
This is real science we're doing here on

82
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:22,340
the podcast.
Um,

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,080
but then so I got an email from a fan 
podcasts@hdsreproductions.com

84
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,560
and she blew my ass out with a new one 
she wanted to broach with us.

85
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,770
So let me read this email from autumn,
autumn g Hello Ethan.

86
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:44,104
And Ila lately on the show,
you guys been talking about your gross 

87
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,224
habits and Isla almost every time has 
said she does not share these strange 

88
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:50,614
routines.
So as it yield Kleiner I had met when 

89
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,390
I'm on my cycle I will often smell my 
blood.

90
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,933
Nope.
Sometimes I find it satisfying and 

91
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:00,934
sometimes I find it gross.
Lately my blood has smelled similar to 

92
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:07,780
red wine and I've never smelled my blood
when it's in a,

93
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,783
oh she says,
and I never smell my blood when it's in 

94
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,880
a Tampon.
Well how does she smell it then?

95
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:13,714
So I hate the smell and that is why I 
usually prefer to wear a tampon cause I 

96
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,740
like you don't smell it as much,
but how does she smell it?

97
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,040
You just from the toilet.
If you wear like a pad?

98
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,293
Yeah.
Oh then you take it off and it was kind 

99
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:32,590
of like a Wa it's like a strong odor.
I hate it.

100
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,450
What does it smell like?
Gross.

101
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,200
Like body odor or like blood?
Both,

102
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,260
I guess you like like stink.
Whoa it,

103
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,653
he has men.
I think all the men listening to this 

104
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:46,840
are like,
wow,

105
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,453
we're not supposed to talk about it.
It's like the ladies pack don't break 

106
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:52,840
the back.
Girls don't poop.

107
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,630
They don't fart and they don't have 
their periods.

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,210
Did you all know that periods stink?
Fuck man.

109
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,053
What did you think?
I never thought about odor being 

110
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:07,070
involved can,
I don't know,

111
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:09,370
maybe I'm not describing it right but I 
find a girl.

112
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,510
It sounds like you're right.
I mean she says herself,

113
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,570
she sniffs her period.
Blood sometimes satisfying some.

114
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:18,650
Do you ever find it satisfying?
I always grows sometimes more gross than

115
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:19,484
other times if I smell it more.
But you think it's all equally gross 

116
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,880
cause she's saying sometimes it has 
extra stake.

117
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:34,060
I guess that's possible.
A fraud like it smelled like red wine.

118
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,970
Does it have anything to do with the 
volume of blood that's in it?

119
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,910
Probably.
And does it have anything to do with the

120
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:41,770
wounds?
The last time you changed your Tampon?

121
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:44,440
Like if how much body odor and sweat 
gets mixed in.

122
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,630
I Dunno,
the fascinating stuff.

123
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,340
It's like,
wow,

124
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,233
this is new.
So you're saying that it uniformly 

125
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:58,994
always smells bad and you even go so far
as to wear tampons to avoid smelling it 

126
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,120
all together.
Yes.

127
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,200
So what I want to pose to our female 
listeners today is,

128
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:15,020
um,
do you ever smell your period blood?

129
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,740
So we are going to make a twitter poll.
Dan,

130
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:19,574
you've got the bigger yup.
For ladies only head on over to h 

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,030
podcasts on twitter.
If you're a lady and cast your vote,

132
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:29,850
do you ever smell your period blood?
Now these are fully anonymous vote,

133
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:30,684
so you don't have to worry about being 
out at or being discovered or anyone 

134
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:37,250
knowing about your disgusting habits,
which we all have.

135
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,084
So not to worry,
but I am truly fascinated by this 

136
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,400
period.
Blood smell.

137
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,563
It's a new concept.
It's a paradigm shift in my 

138
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,360
understanding of periods.

139
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,340
How was the early voting?
I'm very curious.

140
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,410
So my initial refresh,
53 votes,

141
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:57,140
and it's about 50 50.
It's 49 51 right now.

142
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,260
Whoa.
I had a feeling it would be like a vote.

143
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:03,940
We're going to take going to be 50 50.
Was there ever,

144
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,820
no.
Yeah,

145
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:06,110
of course.
No,

146
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,290
there's been huge swings.
There's been huge swings.

147
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,900
We've had 70 thirties and yeah.
Yeah.

148
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,530
We had a 60 40 with the front and wiping
the fiasco.

149
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:16,850
Remember?
No,

150
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,380
that's what I thought it would be.
I think it would be.

151
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,273
I expected that because I,
if I'm a woman and I have stinky 

152
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:25,190
periods,
I'm smelling it cause I'm already saying

153
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:26,024
I smell my farts.
I'd be sounds climbing in that that 50 

154
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,570
50 ratio is holding.
It's holding steady.

155
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,220
I would think that I would be smelling 
my period blood it.

156
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:36,921
Thanks.
So yeah,

157
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:37,754
I would,
because I scratched my balls and 

158
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:40,244
smelling the hint.

159
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,120
I think they just be smelling it.
I think there's just two types of people

160
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:46,040
in the world.
I think so.

161
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,270
Probably the people like or in denial 
me.

162
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,220
Yeah,
you're in.

163
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,053
I do think that's true because it sounds
like I don't want it to return true 

164
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,150
because it sounds like you do smell your
period blood.

165
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:01,840
You're aware of the smell.
I hate it.

166
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,950
I know,
but you what ads on some level you still

167
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:08,160
do smell and assess it and make some 
analysis of it.

168
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,173
The fact is that you're in denial and 
you don't embrace it as something you 

169
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:16,050
know that you can get into on a personal
level.

170
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,720
Right.
I don't know.

171
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,110
I'm happy that I got nine months right 
now.

172
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:22,944
Period went out,
but then it's almost like the baby is 

173
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:30,750
almost like the nine months of period,
like stored up and it's just like,

174
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,410
so it's like a break and then a burst.

175
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,830
Yeah.
I'll be,

176
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,673
oh,
you think you got something good going 

177
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:40,010
on?
Just the wave,

178
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,680
but at least it has a happy end to 
periods.

179
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:46,110
Don't necessarily have happy endings.
Excepted the rover.

180
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
I'll be right there with you.
I haven't.

181
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:51,360
I tell you,
I have so much admiration.

182
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:52,194
I have so much respect.
You have to go through that and I'm not 

183
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,213
jealous of that at all.
I'm truly appreciative that you need to 

184
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:02,640
do that because my god of myself.
No,

185
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,570
I know.
I know.

186
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,753
That's an idea thing.
I mean denial about the that has to 

187
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:08,660
happen.
Yeah,

188
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,800
well it's really just something,
it's like,

189
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,090
oh,
the baby's coming.

190
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,370
Let's just do it.
You just have to do it.

191
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,610
You just have to do it,
but you're going to get drug,

192
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,370
then you're going to be smart about it 
and just not feeling thing because a lot

193
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,800
of women are like,
I'd want to do it natural.

194
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,470
And then halfway through when they're in
excruciating pain,

195
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,340
they're like,
hey man,

196
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:29,300
they thing the band name.
My sister is crazy.

197
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,850
She,
she was like no painkillers and she'll,

198
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,430
she really didn't take anything 
throughout.

199
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,020
Your sister's a superhuman.
She's a freaking nature.

200
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,273
But in your case,
because the reason women don't get this 

201
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,930
because it could take longer,
right?

202
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,410
Yeah.
The Painkiller Fred,

203
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,540
that you,
because you're a nom,

204
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,300
you're won't push hard as much as your 
word if you're not.

205
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,150
I prefer the painkiller from my 
perspective to not feel pain and have it

206
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:58,800
take an extra five hours.
Well,

207
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,660
five hours.
Well,

208
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:04,110
I'm just saying that's an exaggerated 
comparison,

209
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:07,590
but I think that you'll be,
but I agree with you.

210
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,250
You know what I'm saying?
You don't want to trust me.

211
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,740
Trust me.
A guy that knows nothing about it.

212
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,650
I have a friend who was like,
I don't want it.

213
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,380
And then halfway through she decided she
wanted it,

214
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,290
but then it took long ago cause they 
didn't have it prepared for her.

215
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,483
Oh Man.
The whole time she was just like 

216
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,930
[inaudible] you get the painkiller.
Is it like no pain,

217
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:30,300
like total numbness?
No,

218
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,790
it's probably helped the law.
It helps.

219
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,420
But I don't think because when I,
I had a,

220
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:37,560
um,
I don't know,

221
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,290
I had a huge mole removed on my back as 
a kid.

222
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,820
Um,
I think I must've been 12 or 11,

223
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:46,380
but,
um,

224
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,950
it was a really big surgery where they 
cut it out.

225
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,293
And um,
when they gave me numbing shots and it 

226
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:58,990
was extremely,
extremely painful,

227
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,540
it was so painful.
These shots,

228
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,760
oh,
was price cause it was just a shot.

229
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,623
I think this one is also painful,
but I felt nothing like zero sensation 

230
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,580
and I was awake.
But I time,

231
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,590
I think you're already in so much pain 
from the,

232
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,080
uh,
what do you call it?

233
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,250
Contraptions.
Oh,

234
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,480
the contraptions.
Yeah.

235
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,390
So I think that pain of that shot is 
like tracking competitor actions.

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,240
So I think,
I think they have amazing medicines that

237
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,520
I think will really minimize the pain 
you experience.

238
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,070
But the thing is like when I had the 
surgery on my back,

239
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,173
so I felt no pain at all.
But then when they finished they had to 

240
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:38,314
sew me up and the doctor had to cat co,
what do you call that when you 

241
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:43,390
electrocuted?
Catterick colorize cauterize.

242
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,100
He had to cauterize my flesh together.
So he basically,

243
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,430
he literally like burned my flesh 
together and that was fucking,

244
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,260
it wasn't paid.
I couldn't feel the pain,

245
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:56,050
but it felt so weird cause I was being 
electrocuted.

246
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,790
How'd that smell?
That's crazy.

247
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,923
I didn't smell flesh.
I just found it was just a wild 

248
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,760
sensation dude.
But um,

249
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,553
yeah,
so there's a couple of people who 

250
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:07,960
responded.

251
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,540
I do and I secretly think it smells 
okay.

252
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,711
Yeah,
there you go.

253
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:13,330
Exactly.
I don't think exactly.

254
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:16,330
I think this is a very interesting and 
healthy discussion guys.

255
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,493
This moment.
It's actually exactly 50 50 and then 

256
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,670
there's,
I'm not sure what to choose,

257
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:24,430
but you can't avoid smelling it,
but it's still gross.

258
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,313
So there you go.
I think there really are two types of 

259
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,700
people in the world,
you know,

260
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,970
and I think that was exactly 50.
I think that's what it boils down to.

261
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,340
You know,
people who are in denial as you said,

262
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,403
dance and people that are like,
I'm onboard with spelling my period and 

263
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:40,934
my,
I bet you the same people that smell 

264
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:42,664
their fear period blood.
So I'll still smelling their farts and 

265
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:48,640
they'd probably pitched their vagina and
smell their hand probably,

266
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,880
you know.
Um,

267
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,890
all right,
well fascinating stuff here guys.

268
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,010
This is a science explanation,
but if science experience full beginning

269
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,030
fascinating.
Yeah,

270
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:02,020
I love it.
Um,

271
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,800
what else we got here?
Oh,

272
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:06,634
another fence submission.
This was the best fricking video I've 

273
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,720
seen in such a long time.
You guys,

274
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,260
Oh my God.
Talk about Tlc.

275
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:17,020
We've been talking about Tlc a lot.
I haven't seen this yet.

276
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:20,420
So I'm,
so this comes from discovery o.

277
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,890
And.
M.

278
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,670
It's a [inaudible] editor.
Yeah.

279
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,030
Yeah.
I know.

280
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,020
They're like,
hang on guys,

281
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:27,100
we've got to stop,
make,

282
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,080
wait,
planet earth,

283
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,990
none of that.
I'll fucking cancel that.

284
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,053
We're working on a new show called 
diagnose this or diagnosed me and we're 

285
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:45,121
going to do epic reenactments of these,
of these diseases.

286
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:47,530
Now this guy,
Ron,

287
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,720
suffers from ceaseless belching and co 
he's,

288
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,573
he cannot stop burping.
He cannot stop burping and they reenact 

289
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:02,030
it and oh my God,
this is from devin mirrors.

290
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:02,864
So God bless.
[inaudible] this is the best thing I've 

291
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:06,490
seen.
It's incredibly healing

292
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,020
before his condition began.
It's kind of scratchy it up.

293
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,070
Yeah.
Here.

294
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,900
Uh,
I think I might know what's up.

295
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:22,200
Hold on one sec.
We're all set up here.

296
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,210
Very Professional.
Always prepared and very alive.

297
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,010
That's right.
Folks.

298
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,820
How are you feeling?
You feeling pregnant?

299
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,760
I feel really tired and I think that's 
part of this stage.

300
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,850
How was Disney for you yesterday as a 
pregnant lady?

301
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,980
I could,
I go on all the fun rides.

302
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,220
So I thought,
what are already like a boring mom.

303
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,850
I felt so bad for you as I wrote all the
awesome rides and I was tired because he

304
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:56,964
fixed it.
Yeah,

305
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,050
I'm already lame yet.
And you're not lame.

306
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:02,250
It's not your fault.
You're amazing.

307
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:03,084
You have a fucking,
you're growing a human body and your 

308
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,620
stomach.
That's as amazing as it gets.

309
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,610
Pretty cool.
Yeah.

310
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,800
You know,
laying your fricking awesome.

311
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,163
All right,
here we go.

312
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,090
It's wife sue.
Have a good day recently.

313
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,113
That's love baby

314
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,680
or stress.
Just working on growing my business.

315
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,563
I look at this,
this is the reenactment that gives you 

316
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:34,170
any more.
That was like,

317
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,004
what am I watching?

318
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,780
Hello?
So the burping sound is insane.

319
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,420
It's always like,
uh,

320
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,403
and um,
but I soon learned is that the burping 

321
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:50,550
soundbite they use is a sound bite from 
the actual guy.

322
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,770
It is.
So he's actually,

323
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,870
so what they're doing is playing the 
actual birth,

324
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,360
but the guy every time they say that,
no,

325
00:16:57,361 --> 00:17:00,720
you could tell because they show one 
brief clip of actual guy burping.

326
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,883
And so they use that one soundbite and 
they use it every time in this 

327
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:05,730
reenactment.
And it sounds,

328
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,100
it's the same stuff.
Oh my God,

329
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,623
it's amazing.

330
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,630
I'm sorry ma'am.
It started gradually

331
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,190
and he's so like,
it's like you just burp I,

332
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
and he's always like,
I'm so sorry ma'am.

333
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,390
But yeah,

334
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,340
I would be,
I'm looking trolling,

335
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,183
you know when I was at the customer's 
house and then when I went outside and 

336
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,630
real dump trunk,
I've just belching belching balls.

337
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,010
You got the brushed her off

338
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,903
three.

339
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,830
It seemed crazy.
Ron's no,

340
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,370
sorry.
I can't help it.

341
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,580
I balls for maybe 2030 minutes an hour 
and then start up again.

342
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,970
Why do you have to Burp so loud?
Just close your mouth.

343
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,150
Well,
you don't have to Burp loud.

344
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,180
I don't think he can control it.
Does this show about it?

345
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:20,230
I don't think it can control it.
Lee.

346
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:21,064
He's burping a lot,
but I mean you could control how loud 

347
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:25,420
you burp.
You can go or you can be like,

348
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,390
not always.
Really.

349
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,070
I've never heard you burp.
What do you know about it?

350
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,420
I see people burp,
but you burp quietly,

351
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,680
right?
Because you're a lady.

352
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,760
I don't remember.
Yeah,

353
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,290
thanks.
One of us should sleep.

354
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:52,110
At least one of us should sleep,
can be part of society.

355
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,383
Sat Up.
He literally said he wakes his 

356
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,740
neighbors,
address a series of tests.

357
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,480
His doctor had a bowel obstruction and 
suggest it's all in Ron's head.

358
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,720
Stop thinking about it so much.
What are you supposed to do?

359
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Like Dang gone has been belching nonstop
for months cause that's

360
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,693
suburb.
I've never heard a burp like that in my 

361
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:35,410
life and so yeah,
it has to be there using that soundbite,

362
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,710
going to dozens of doctors,
the one cure that's out working.

363
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,733
Look at that face.
Look at this reaction that seemed to 

364
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:52,481
work.
Just stopped working with a vengeance.

365
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,870
Leaving Ron.
So desperate he wants to kill himself

366
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,910
there you got,
he wants to kill him.

367
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,240
Well he,
yeah,

368
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,360
I know.
I feel bad for the guy,

369
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:03,194
but like they do this sound editing 
where they'll take the soundbite burp 

370
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,660
like here and then they'll like damp in 
it.

371
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,523
So it seems like he's far away,
but they're just using the same 

372
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,873
soundbite

373
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,230
Ron.
So desperate.

374
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,710
He wants to kill himself dry.
How thing?

375
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,110
No,
they're making them

376
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,490
like,
yeah,

377
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,610
like he's turning into a wall,
like a Stephen King novel.

378
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:32,200
But yeah,
he's like a werewolf.

379
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,560
What is happening?

380
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,493
Yeah,

381
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,133
finds out what's going on.
She panics and calls nine one one 

382
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,830
emergency room.
They looked over my records.

383
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,170
They said there's nothing we can do for 
you.

384
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,343
We're going to,
Scott is assigned to mental health 

385
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:57,280
counselor Lisa Gustin.
Right.

386
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,350
Rick questions open up the reservoir of 
pent up.

387
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,560
Although he does this factor when he 
birthed,

388
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,300
I didn't see the guy do that.

389
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,240
He just fit every criteria for anxiety 
and depression.

390
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,210
He fitted

391
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,153
why way.
It turns out he needed an 

392
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:17,290
antidepressant.
Really and he wasn't manifesting anxiety

393
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,190
and unusual way and that he's cared now 
for.

394
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:24,250
I believe it.
You do what's on discovery.

395
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:25,084
You can't be wrong.
They wouldn't lie to us hitting me with 

396
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:32,650
that sound bite.
That's the BURP.

397
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,503
The first time I started,
I wish I could wash the first time with 

398
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:40,250
you guys cause the first time I saw this
I was just crying.

399
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,460
I hard.
That's all so good.

400
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,803
So fun.

401
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,640
Look at that diagnosis Ron.
On the general lines,

402
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,690
they worry,
they edit it.

403
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,423
He does this look like perfect like a 
thousand times a day and he's surprised 

404
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:01,274
every time it happens.
Adidas sorta combined with clinical 

405
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:08,950
depression.
I of those things where I'll burp.

406
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,413
I guess I got out of the problems.
It stimulates the brain in a certain 

407
00:22:14,451 --> 00:22:16,370
area.
I love that.

408
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,970
That video is fricking Jim.
I did.

409
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,463
Oh,
shout out.

410
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,440
Wow.
Having a lot of fun here.

411
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,940
That's a great suggestion.
Um,

412
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,340
damn.
What's the pool at?

413
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,160
Uh,
let's take a look.

414
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:36,190
We've got refreshing a 49 51 man.
This,

415
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,610
this truly is the nature of what this is
going down.

416
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,730
You actually the yeses slightly down,
but I mean it's (485) 024-0850 two no.

417
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,420
Oh,
so no is slightly edging.

418
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,680
So that makes it feel more realistic.
Um,

419
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,690
I feel like the margin of error though,
like you got to say it that that's it.

420
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,870
That's a split.
Well,

421
00:22:57,871 --> 00:22:58,704
the pro,
the problem is that you have to vote to 

422
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:01,310
see the results.

423
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,550
And so a lot of dudes out there one,
is that right?

424
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,950
What I see the results.
It says ladies only.

425
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,470
So I know any dudes are voting.
There's got it.

426
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,330
I wish there was a way to view the 
results and about,

427
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,273
it's so messed up because you know what 
you we to add a third option that says 

428
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:20,950
I'm a dude.
Oh then it doesn't affect the fricking,

429
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,140
you know what should we do?
Another one do a new one.

430
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,990
A race that one dan and start over with 
a third option.

431
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,350
I'm a dude.
No vote and thank you.

432
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,463
All right.
I've been trying to say for many years 

433
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:35,840
and I'm a brilliant mind to listen to me
more.

434
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,010
Cause there is a couple of guys here 
including and from a smudge.

435
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,300
What did he well they sat,
I'm a guy so this is sexist.

436
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,460
Oh well you smell your period bug in.

437
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,500
You Smell Pam's period blood.
Yolande it's not your period blood.

438
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,880
I don't want to like I want to,
I'm kidding.

439
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,220
I don't know anymore.
You all smell it.

440
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,370
You see,
I don't know if she tried to be your own

441
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,090
excrement.
I mean you've got a cookie live.

442
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,520
I'm so out of your got a cookie.
Just straight on the table.

443
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,820
Like we have plates unfold at the 
tweets,

444
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,783
the tweets back up.
Anybody that already voted you gotta go 

445
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:19,334
back to you're obligated.
You should leave a comment and explain 

446
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:25,710
why we re posted it.
I'm like,

447
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,000
okay.
I don't go fuck.

448
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,200
It's just a fucking sick and I don't 
give a shit.

449
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,900
That was Scott.
Ian brought cookies.

450
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,230
I'm like [inaudible].
Every time I see doughnuts or cookies or

451
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:40,240
something on the table,
I'm like,

452
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:41,074
who the fuck brought these?
I get angry as I eat them because I'm 

453
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:45,260
like,
I don't need this shit.

454
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,930
And it's always Ian.
He was trying to feed me.

455
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,690
Oh,
it is always the end.

456
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,880
I know he's a feeder and I yelled at him
every time I say,

457
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:55,220
don't bring this shit here is I eat 
three of them.

458
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,883
Okay,
we got to go to a break or should we 

459
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:04,970
move on to the Youtube?
Okay,

460
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,460
great.
System is broken pretty early for break.

461
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,020
How much time?
I think Youtube,

462
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,090
uh,
worth 24 minutes.

463
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,000
Okay.
You want to know about the new Paul?

464
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,830
Yeah.
What is it?

465
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,170
Is it a big difference?
Well,

466
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:21,190
I'm a dude is winning a lot.
Well that's not good.

467
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,060
But if you're removed that we have yes.
28 yes,

468
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,330
that's true.
And No,

469
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:30,170
24 oh this is,
this is so important.

470
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,230
This is such an important social 
experiments or flat valid,

471
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,230
fundamentally flawed.
Well,

472
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:37,250
no,
not all of them.

473
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,113
Just gender specific ones,
which is like all of them not far on 

474
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:42,410
your hand and spell it.
That's the big one.

475
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,610
Hello.
Trying to throw out my science.

476
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:48,890
I think it's the only guy in my head.
Can I get another cookie?

477
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:49,730
Those are incredible.

478
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,830
Um,
okay.

479
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:52,664
I got something to complain about here.
Everyone who likes to hear me complain 

480
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:58,160
about Youtube.
This is just a fun little anecdote.

481
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,380
So I got a claim.
Oh,

482
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:01,214
you actually brought me a cookie.
I didn't need that to let you know that 

483
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,470
your mom delivered all of her babies 
naturally.

484
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,143
Oh yeah.
So I don't know if you could hear that 

485
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,550
Ethan's mom delivered all of her babies 
naturally,

486
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:19,430
but I think that was just the time back 
then,

487
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,030
isn't it?
I feel like my mom did too.

488
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,600
Or like my mom would have a lot to say 
about this chicken call.

489
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,933
It gives me more time to eat cookies.
I'm just trying to buy time to eat more 

490
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:32,800
cookies.
These are sane.

491
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,060
Ian.
What the Fuck's wrong too?

492
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,790
Um,
all right theresa,

493
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:39,470
let me focus it.
Got this off.

494
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,850
This is the worst episode we've ever 
done.

495
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:48,330
Good ball gets to everybody.
Um,

496
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,130
so loud.
Okay,

497
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:52,651
sorry.
Sorry.

498
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:53,490
Sorry everybody.
Sorry.

499
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,710
All right,
here.

500
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:57,060
I'm going to complain about Youtube.
Okay.

501
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,550
Yay.
We're coming here for papa.

502
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,220
John,
mute me.

503
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,053
Okay.
This is a highlight claimed by whoever 

504
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:08,340
these cocksuckers are for a song,
sex on fire.

505
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,450
Okay.
Here's the interesting little fact.

506
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,500
We didn't use that song.
It's not even in the clip.

507
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:22,430
So I file a dispute and there's not even
an option for this.

508
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:25,890
Whatever you claimed isn't even in my 
video.

509
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,973
[inaudible]

510
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,230
there's not even an option of like fuck 
off.

511
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,450
Right?
So anyway,

512
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,310
I,
I what?

513
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:36,270
I don't remember what I did.
I think I did like,

514
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,670
I think you just doing like,
it's fair.

515
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,260
Use My,
my use.

516
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:42,660
Is there something I didn't know you 
didn't use it?

517
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,370
I don't know what I did,
but how would that even get in there?

518
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,750
Well,
I didn't know what I did,

519
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,680
but I just basically said in the 
scripture,

520
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,480
this song did not appear in the video.
So release your claim.

521
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,650
And so here's the best part.
These are these huge media companies.

522
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,810
Just go on rampages of claiming videos 
because there's no,

523
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,330
um,
there's no recourse,

524
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:10,164
there's no accountability.
They get free money and they have no 

525
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:16,350
reason not to claim every single video.
I waiting for one of these guys who just

526
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:20,190
claim every single video on youtube.
They're like,

527
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:21,090
fuck yeah,
no,

528
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:23,750
you use sex on fire.
The way the law's written there,

529
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:28,770
there's no recourse or well technically 
or a false claim that it's so broad.

530
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,460
It says,
um,

531
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:38,510
and good faith.
So you could,

532
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,643
I think that a claim like this for 
something that's not even in the video 

533
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:45,830
is an end good faith.
But you're,

534
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,090
you're bringing a lawsuit,
I guess the company for something.

535
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,130
So,
you know,

536
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,343
it's just,

537
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,220
and there's no damages.
It's like,

538
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,630
it's pointless.
What do you,

539
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:03,230
what do you know what I'm saying?
You would need to have like a huge class

540
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:08,150
action lawsuit to show like tons of 
damage over like thousands of users.

541
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,420
It would be so complicated to actually 
litigate that.

542
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,230
So expensive and complicated to litigate
that and they know it.

543
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,450
And as far as I'm aware,
they've never been held,

544
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,790
recount accountable for this shit.
Here's the options.

545
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,713
Um,
these are all these except for fair use 

546
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:24,944
I think or well,
most of them except for farriers are 

547
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:31,670
just like youtube way of being like,
see you later,

548
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:32,504
idiot.
Here's what you get when you try to 

549
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:37,490
dispute it.
I own the CD that's youtube being like,

550
00:29:37,491 --> 00:29:38,324
see Ya.

551
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,970
I think if you click that they're,
you don't have a reason.

552
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,130
You don't know what you're talking 
about.

553
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,993
Yeah.
I'm not selling the video or making any 

554
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:47,680
money.
That's a skip.

555
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,770
I gave credit in the video.
That's his cup videos,

556
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:52,720
my original content.
I own all the rights to it.

557
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:54,360
So that one's fine.
Um,

558
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,620
I have a license or permission.
That one's fine.

559
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,690
Meets Fair use.
That one's fine.

560
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,180
Content is public domain.
So those ones are all fine.

561
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:05,680
Actually find claims to make.
So I don't remember which one I did,

562
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:10,681
but their response is what's really 
makes this a powerful.

563
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,630
Um,
they responded by,

564
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,980
I disputed it and they responded by 
rejecting my dispute.

565
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,823
Okay,

566
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,600
who is they?
And this huge media companies,

567
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:28,710
I don't know.
Youtube,

568
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,660
not youtube,
these media company,

569
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:32,910
I don't know what spa and there's like 
seven of them.

570
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,680
So I said,
hey,

571
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:36,420
this isn't your songs.
And even in the video,

572
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,340
that's the first level.
You dispute that.

573
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,490
And then they come back,
they rejected my dispute and they said,

574
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,040
ah,
I don't fucking care.

575
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,140
I'm keeping it sex on fire.

576
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,450
That's the worst thing is that they 
accused us of using kings of Leon.

577
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,420
I didn't even know what that was.
Pop sign.

578
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,263
Never.
It's like,

579
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,570
what?
So I'm like,

580
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:01,280
okay,
that's insane.

581
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,450
Um,
the fact that they would dispute it.

582
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:11,150
So now I am forced to go one step 
further in the process.

583
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,580
And at this point you basically say your
songs aren't in the video,

584
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,443
leave me alone.
And they have the option to strike and 

585
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,294
remove the video.
So there's something wrong with youtube 

586
00:31:23,451 --> 00:31:26,120
though because three of our last three 
videos have been claimed,

587
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,343
like the frequency of claiming videos 
and just erroneous and shameless claims 

588
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:34,220
have sky.
I mean three of our last view.

589
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,073
And it's still a bunch of new companies 
that have like a whole division that is 

590
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:42,410
just this.
I think that it has new claiming stuff.

591
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:46,850
I think they have tools because you 
cannot go watch videos.

592
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,850
They have some kind of automated tools 
that match it.

593
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,510
And this case it's wrong.
And they don't even put in the effort to

594
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,890
reviewing it.
I mean,

595
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,963
youtube has got to regulate these people
because they're running a muck right 

596
00:31:59,691 --> 00:32:02,090
now.
It has not been this bad ever,

597
00:32:02,091 --> 00:32:04,480
I don't think.
Um,

598

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,310
Dan in the PDF.
I don't see the pbl.

601
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,920
I opened a tab of it.
You should stop reading.

602
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,540
Oh my God.
It's not tab and you're on the desktop.

603
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:30,140
Here it is again.
That does not work.

604
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,050
It doesn't work then.
All right,

605
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:37,610
forget about it.
You gotta put on my desktop next time.

606
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,800
Um,
so that's about it.

607
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,953
I'll share this pick when we get back.
This is the best episode we've ever 

608
00:32:47,071 --> 00:32:47,904
time.
This is the one that will be remembered 

609
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:51,164
for.

610
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,630
So,

611
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,430
we will be back with that picture that 
you're promised.

612
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,833
We've got a lot to talk about.
Celebrity asm are a bunch of amazing 

613
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:04,604
videos.
Elon musk is a weed and a call from Gb 

614
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,610
Acmr who has got some Churros that we've
talked about.

615
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,473
She's got choice words for me.
She's got a beef with what I've said 

616
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:22,460
about ace mar and we're going to squash 
that beef here today or ramp it up.

617
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,160
You never know.

635
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:25,310
I'm going to recommend a book to Y'all 
that I absolutely love.

636
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,040
It's called the subtle art of not giving
a bleep,

637
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,590
which is the f word,
but it's bleeped out.

638
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,060
Um,
this is,

639
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:32,894
uh,
this is an unorthodox motivational book 

640
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:40,810
because there's been a whole kind of 
slew of like self help gurus saying that

641
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:44,960
positive thinking is the answer to 
improving our life.

642
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,100
And this guy says,
no.

643
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,230
Positive thinking is not only not the 
answer,

644
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:51,380
it's the problem.
What we need is to accept that we're all

645
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,120
damaged,
life isn't fair.

646
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,930
And what we need more is to just stop 
giving a frick.

647
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,880
It's hilarious.
It's raw.

648
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,510
It's powerful.
I highly recommend the subtle art of not

649
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:03,344
giving a bleep and it's very well 
narrated and it is available on audible

All y'all could see that.

707
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:57,510
fricking impact on your business,
and that's why it's so important to find

708
00:37:57,511 --> 00:38:00,090
the right people.
But where do you find those people?

709
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,043
You could try posting on job boards,
but let's re let's be frank with each 

710
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:04,530
other.
Who's on job boards?

711
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,820
Weirdos,
all of them.

712
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,160
Okay.
Instead,

713
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,023
you need to find the person's can take 
your business to the next level and 

714
00:38:11,311 --> 00:38:14,370
where do you find those people on linked
in?

715
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,383
That's right.
As the world's largest professional 

716
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,110
network,
people go to linkedin every fricking day

717
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,050
to grow professionally and discovered 
job opportunities.

718
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,140
70% of the US workforce is already 
there.

719
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,880
What?
That's insane.

720
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,750
Linkedin job matches.
People do your role based on more of who

721
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,643
they really are.
The skills interest in even how open 

722
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:34,164
they are to new opportunities.
This way your job gets seen by more of 

723
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:37,474
the right people.
Most linkedin members haven't recently 

724
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:40,384
visited top job boards,
but nine out of 10 of them are open to 

725
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:43,834
new opportunities.
That means you are going to be stealing 

726
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:48,850
the best people from the best jobs 
because yours is even better.

727
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,273
So you can only reach them on linkedin 
and that's why new hires made every 10 

728
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:57,820
seconds using linkedin.
Now,

729
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,733
now new hires every 10 seconds and 
business rate businesses rate linkedin 

730
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:08,610
40% higher than job boards at delivering
quality candidates.

731
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,340
Guys.
If you're looking for the right employee

Crappy designs.

00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,330
Prank of agent starts world war three is
Pewdie Pie.

743
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,173
Racist toy channels are ruining society.
Crazy feminists triggered by lyft

00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:04,100
driver.
That's the title.

745
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:08,420
So cringy crazy feminists gets 
triggered.

746
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,300
Oh,
that's so cringey to the different time,

747
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:14,950
wasn't it?
Featuring humongous dicks out for her.

748
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:17,780
Rhombi which is like a kid.
I mean I,

749
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,610
it's like Kik.
Give me a break.

750
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,020
Is the monetized because it has an 
asterix?

751
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,220
I think because what we do is a face,
no,

752
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,240
it's the most wholesome Joey Salads,
the deleted social experiment,

753
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,440
prank invasion,
the dangers of social media.

754
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:41,470
Girl virtually assaulted in GTA.
See Israel of Loc.

755
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,910
It's a Vlog baby.
Love your body.

756
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,120
Alison gold,
Dj Khaled.

757
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:51,121
[inaudible] kissing pranks.
The original dg Kalb celebrates hold you

758
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:52,970
down.
Alison gold,

759
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,130
ABCD,
fg.

760
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,720
Um,
and so many more.

761
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:01,990
It's just older and stuff.
But like these are a lot of our main big

762
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:05,870
videos that people aren't videos.
That's the total at the top.

763
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,800
Yeah,
71.

764
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,770
I mean a lot of them are old.
Probably like 20 or 30 of them are.

765
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,350
But these,
these are our cream of the crop.

766
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,800
These are our money earners cause they 
still give used over it.

767
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,270
That's a big one.
A lot of the old ones are unlisted.

768
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,080
Okay.
But the ones I'm showing you are our big

769
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:24,914
earners.

770
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,150
Those are really,
and some of our most viewed videos.

771
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:30,590
So yeah.
And the,

772
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,633
they don't tell you they just like just 
a day ago I saw just randomly in my 

773
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:40,760
email like five new videos,
like of our biggest ones,

774
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:43,160
like not suitable.
It's like,

775
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:44,300
okay,
that's weird.

776
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,223
Why?
Yeah,

777
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,700
why,
who cares?

778
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,523
So shout out to youtube and to the 
copyright system for helping to 

779
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:58,540
encourage creators and to be a very 
encouraging environment.

780
00:41:59,091 --> 00:41:59,924
Now since we created this,
do you smell your period blood pole and 

781
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:04,070
added option for?
I'm a dude.

782
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,890
The results have swung quite a bit.
Yes.

783
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,470
Because I can see a lot of dudes just 
being like,

784
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:10,610
no,
that's gross.

785
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,013
Let me see the results.
But the majority is giving us yes in 

786
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:16,154
this,
um,

787
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:22,180
in this scenario here,
how do you feel about that?

788
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:23,534
Hello?
I'm surprised by it after doing this 

789
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:28,130
podcast.
Not surprised.

790
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:31,130
Not surprised.
All right.

791
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,240
Where were we?
Um,

792
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,120
Yada,
Yada Yada.

793
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,480
We've got the mail bombers car we got to
chose,

794
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:43,940
chases criminal down.
Let me get a Acmr.

795
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,953
Let me do this same more segment cause 
we got gb standing by to give us her 

796
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:54,911
opinion.
I came across this celebrity Asm,

797
00:42:55,811 --> 00:42:58,300
Amr playlists,
who,

798
00:42:58,301 --> 00:43:00,030
who put this together.
It was like a,

799
00:43:00,031 --> 00:43:02,720
a huge magazine.
Um,

800
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,340
oh,
it's a w magazine.

801
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,920
W I ever heard what the hell,
what did they do?

802
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:13,010
What does any magazine do?
20th right?

803
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,263
Making youtube videos,
trying to make a viral videos so they 

804
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:20,840
have celebrities do eighth or,
but I don't really,

805
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,430
they have a lot,
by the way.

806
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,800
Carra de,
I don't know how to say her name.

807
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:26,590
You guys don't know who she is and 
they'll,

808
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,730
Dell Levine a gal,
good dot.

809
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,760
Aubrey plaza,
Kate Hudson,

810
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,690
Ashley Graham,
Emily Radic,

811
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:41,330
Koski Cardi B and so many more.
Some hike.

812
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:42,164
They're all females by the way,
which kind of supports my theory for 

813
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,280
Jake Gyllenhaal as one guy,
but otherwise it's all females.

814
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,000
Supports my theory that GB is going to 
try to dispute,

815
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,730
which is fine.
Gb,

816
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,153
um,
that this is largely used by men that 

817
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,500
liked this virtual companionship of 
females.

818
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,650
And I feel like especially the one with 
Cardi B,

819
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,030
when you show it,
I'll show that.

820
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,440
But first I want to show up what most of
them.

821
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,720
This is actually the most viewed one by 
Cora.

822
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,170
That's 5 million views and I don't think
they will.

823
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,580
It's,
she's just whispering.

824
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,040
Um,
really me so weird.

825
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,760
Westbury.
She just,

826
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:33,923
you know,
it's actually really bad for your 

827
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:35,754
throat.

828
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,050
Fun fact number one.

829
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:44,700
Um,
I dunno,

830
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,830
I'm Kyra telephone,
which is just worth a frame.

831
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:51,560
I don't know what she has to mix.
Why does she keep switching mikes?

832
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,730
It's not really,
it's tomorrow.

833
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,990
That's a big part of it is because 
they're pan hard left and right.

834
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:57,853
And so like us in the back right now 
with the headphones were hearing her in 

835
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:01,840
one year and then the other year and I 
think that's like,

836
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,840
that's part of it.
Yeah.

837
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:05,810
But I think you're supposed to do like 
use it as for the like,

838
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,240
but she's no expert.
We have an expert on the line.

839
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,350
Yes.
I played too.

840
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,230
At any rate,
it's niche.

841
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,130
It's just,
it's just a celebrity whispering,

842
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,613
you know?
Yeah.

843
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,040
Like Cardi B on the other hand does give
it a fair shake.

844
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:26,540
I'm actually impressed she got through 
it.

845
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,340
Yeah.
Look at this dude.

846
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,280
My Dick is straight up at full half math
right now.

847
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:38,300
I wonder if she smells or period blood.
She probably does already be.

848
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:47,710
Probably next time you're approaching a 
girl that you're interested in,

849
00:45:49,701 --> 00:45:50,511
you're like,
gosh,

850
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:52,520
she's amazing.
She's so out of my league.

851
00:45:52,521 --> 00:45:54,050
I can't even talk to her.
Just remember,

852
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:58,740
most likely she smells her period.
Blood life dude.

853
00:45:59,320 --> 00:45:59,940
Yeah,
Dude.

854
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,240
Just remember she's human.
She's snips your period blood.

855
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:09,790
I'm getting tinkled I like the hand 
gestures.

856
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,073
She's got her hand out on a client like 
scratching my back or something 

857
00:46:15,021 --> 00:46:15,854
virtually.
Right.

858
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,680
Did she sell intuit?
Oh yeah.

859
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,710
Fucking a stroke.
It,

860
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,050
it's kind of weird with the Mike's and 
Oh,

861
00:46:30,051 --> 00:46:31,850
she's dual welding.
She's fucking,

862
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:36,410
Oh God.
She's taken both of them at once.

863
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,000
I saw it and I was like,
what the fuck dude?

864
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:45,130
I'm tingling and all the right places,
but she is actually doing good.

865
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:52,451
I feel like she is,
but I want to know what you think so,

866
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:57,140
but yeah,
so I think we've properly set it up.

867
00:46:57,141 --> 00:47:01,440
So let's get the expert on the line.
Gba,

868
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,610
Smr,
um,

869
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:06,260
is with us here today.
Gb,

870
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,910
how are Ya?
God bless you.

871
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,590
Thanks for joining us.
Hey,

872
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:12,523
nice to meet you.
Thanks for joining us here today as our 

873
00:47:15,801 --> 00:47:17,750
resident,
a smart expert.

874
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,590
Now your channel is quite big and it is 
very popular.

875
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:23,480
You're very good at what you do 
apparently,

876
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:26,210
and so thank you.
First of all,

877
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:28,520
I have to ask you,
do you smell your period blood?

878
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:29,683
Yeah,

879
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,063
we were just talking about that in the 
room because we were watching the 

880
00:47:33,591 --> 00:47:34,424
beginning of the podcast.

881
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:35,500
Yeah.
Okay.

882
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,080
I'm glad you have a preference to that.
That would have come off really weird.

883
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,550
He didn't know what I was talking about.

884
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:46,640
We were saying that like that's the,
that's the consensus is you don't really

885
00:47:46,641 --> 00:47:47,474
have a choice.

886
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,470
Right,
but the question really,

887
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:50,981
well,
okay,

888
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:51,600
let's,
we don't need,

889
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,220
we have who don't need to dive too deep,
but you didn't you,

890
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:55,054
you smell it against your will.
Seems to be your answer so you can 

891
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:04,490
finally grows.
No wait.

892
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:06,090
She said no,
she doesn't know gross.

893
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:08,260
No,
it's not pleasant.

894
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:09,650
I would not.
I would not smell it.

895
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:11,970
Okay,
excellent.

896
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,950
Great.
I'm glad we got to the bottom of that.

897
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,023
Now,
what did you think about these 

898
00:48:15,561 --> 00:48:19,470
celebrity?
I'm a cmr segments that I just shared.

899
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,550
If you're watching those.

900
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,990
Yeah,
I've actually seen those.

901
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:24,870
So the W it's,
it's,

902
00:48:24,871 --> 00:48:25,930
it's a women's magazine.
Yes.

903
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:26,980
Oh,
okay.

904
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:30,500
Okay.
Okay.

905
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:32,600
Yeah,

906
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,500
it's actually really cool to see 
celebrities doing asmr because,

907
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:37,600
you know,
just a couple of years ago,

908
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:40,970
it's something that no one was talking 
about or I had heard I've heard of,

909
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,253
like I've been watching it for like 
eight years on Youtube and since I know 

910
00:48:45,621 --> 00:48:46,454
my channel is all like two years old,
but I've been watching it forever and 

911
00:48:48,531 --> 00:48:49,364
like I was always embarrassed to talk 
about it because when you come in on it 

912
00:48:52,941 --> 00:48:53,880
at first,
so like this,

913
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,760
this is kind of weird,
like objectively.

914
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,880
Hmm.
Um,

915
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,340
but when you see people like Cardi b 
like doing asr,

916
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:01,943
less weird,
so they're sort of making it more 

917
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:04,784
normal.

918
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:06,883
And so what is it that I got wrong or 
what did I miss and my original segment 

919
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,770
about asm,
our videos?

920
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,143
Because to me,
I think people I've previously spoken 

921
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:21,971
that it does seem to be like the popular
Acmr channels are ones of cute,

922
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,860
you know,
cute young girls,

923
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,660
not,
not young,

924
00:49:26,661 --> 00:49:28,940
not young,
young ladies,

925
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,600
practice two attractive young ladies.
And um,

926
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:33,740
it seems,
uh,

927
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:34,603
you know,
as a guy it's a nice kind of way to get 

928
00:49:36,981 --> 00:49:41,030
a companionship and relaxed and you have
kind of a wave spending time,

929
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,970
intimate time with a girl.
Do you contradict that?

930
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,540
I don't think you're wrong.
I don't think that's everything though.

931
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,250
Okay.
Um,

932
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,430
I think most like most people who have 
never seen it before,

933
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,690
they jump in on it and they're like,
oh,

934
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:57,970
this must be a sex day.
Hmm.

935
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,073
Um,
and while you can absolutely find asmr 

936
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:05,860
videos of sexual overtones,
you can find sexual anything.

937
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:06,694
You know,
people will always utilize that to get 

938
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:10,300
views or you know,
to gain popularity quickly.

939
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:12,280
Or maybe it's just how they like to do 
it.

940
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,430
Um,
but I have some art itself.

941
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,800
Like I keep asking people like,
over and over again,

942
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:18,880
I'm like,
so why do you watch it?

943
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:21,580
Why do you watch it?
I'm just like the overwhelming response.

944
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:23,710
It's just people need to be stressed,
you know?

945
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:27,220
Like they need to relax and it's free 
and it's accessible.

946
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,670
Hmm.
Um,

947
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,930
and more people enjoy Asmr like,
like nightly,

948
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:35,150
like they just want to sleep,
I think.

949
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,100
Um,
but I have heard,

950
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:37,934
and I'm even myself,
like I've used the smr when you feel 

951
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,700
like lonely and you just want somebody 
talking for a while on a video.

952
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,593
But I mean,
you could do that with any youtube 

953
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:49,424
video.

954
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,760
Yeah.
But there's this kind of the whispering,

955
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:53,463
you know,
this,

956
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,470
there's a sense of intimacy and like the
ticking it tough.

957
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:57,971
You know,
it's,

958
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:58,610
it's,
it's,

959
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,100
you know,
you know what,

960
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:04,160
so what does a popular misconception 
about asm or that people get wrong?

961
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:07,660
He want to correct that.
It's not just sexual,

962
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,130
you said,
you said intimacy because it,

963
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:12,890
I think that we can all agree that it 
is,

964
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,540
it's intimate.
Yes.

965
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:16,580
Um,
but I would say like,

966
00:51:16,581 --> 00:51:17,414
it's more intimate in the way that like,
like when your mom like puts you to bed 

967
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:22,700
and she was like rubbing your back and 
singing you a song.

968
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,230
If you wouldn't want a stranger do that 
to you,

969
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,680
but it's not sexual.
Um,

970
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,050
and so I think like when somebody gets,

971
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,800
yeah,
I think for a lot of guys it might be,

972
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:40,230
I do like the idea,
but I don't have a problem.

973
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:41,064
Yeah,
I agree that it's not only sexual 

974
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:44,250
though,
but I know like with,

975
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:48,920
and the intern it is like,
no,

976
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,610
I don't want to embarrass you too much 
about it,

977
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:53,670
but uh,
he is a fan of yours.

978
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,420
He was just watching you the other day,
right?

979
00:51:56,421 --> 00:51:57,254
Yeah.
I'm honored in Jewish and he is too 

980
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:03,930
embarrassing on it.
Monica.

981
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,323
Well,
um,

982
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,473
let's move on then.
He'll build up the courage as we could 

983
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:08,943
tell to talk.
So how do you feel about this one would 

984
00:52:10,741 --> 00:52:14,690
Cardi B it is very sexual acts are like,
dude,

985
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,533
she was folic,
I dunno how to use given a double blow 

986
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:20,400
jobs as far as I can.
That's an unfortunate microphone shape,

987
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,300
but she was like,

988
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,720
she listens to asm are a lot.
I'm like,

989
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:29,890
we've,
we've known that before.

990
00:52:29,891 --> 00:52:32,820
Like she's seated.
Yeah.

991
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:33,891
That's cool.
How,

992
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:37,210
because you can tell when somebody is 
actually seen it before and they get it.

993
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,390
Like it's hard to explain why.
Like I know she gets it,

994
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,253
but she does.

995
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:41,930
No,
no,

996
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,710
you can't love that.
Um,

997
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,353
do you know what your demographic 
between male and female on your 

998
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:51,804
analytics

999
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,360
[inaudible] 60% male,
40% female.

1000
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,493
Interesting.
Pretty good spread that it's skewed as 

1001
00:52:59,081 --> 00:52:59,950
you would think.
Right.

1002
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,360
My Mail skews way more than that.
Got like 85% male.

1003
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:10,030
People are watching your videos for you 
baby,

1004
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,470
you think?
Um,

1005
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:14,800
do you ever get any creepy emails or 
tweets from guys that get,

1006
00:53:14,801 --> 00:53:16,500
like,
there's gotta be some guys that get like

1007
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,340
overly attached with you,
right?

1008
00:53:18,341 --> 00:53:20,070
Probably a fringe,
I'm sure about.

1009
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,020
So what's the craziest Shit you've seen?

1010
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,113
Okay.
There have been a couple people where I 

1011
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:30,880
had to like get police involved.
Um,

1012
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,700
people are unable to sort of separate 
the distinction of like,

1013
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,700
I'm speaking to an audience and not to 
you specifically.

1014
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,473
Um,
I know a lot of people have had that 

1015
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:43,134
issue,
not,

1016
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:47,040
it's a lot of like personalities and you
know,

1017
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:49,530
people who talk to their audience and 
stuff like that.

1018
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,393
But,
uh,

1019
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:51,623
I had this one person who sent me like 
tens of thousands of messages before I 

1020
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:55,560
even saw it.
Wow.

1021
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,580
Where did they sounding as if I was 
responding to him.

1022
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,040
Oh my goodness.
That must have freaked you out.

1023
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,790
That was very freaky.
Where did what,

1024
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:07,940
what a platform where the message is 
sent on?

1025
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,600
That's facebook messenger.

1026
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,290
Ooh.
Hmm.

1027
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,150
Yeah.
Like a friend.

1028
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,380
Like they were a facebook friend.

1029
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,360
Well,
I had a page for it,

1030
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,700
CBA tomorrow and people could just send 
messages to it,

1031
00:54:22,701 --> 00:54:23,780
but I wouldn't get notified.

1032
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,460
Um,
wow.

1033
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:31,080
Hazards of the job.
Now finally,

1034
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:35,050
I want to say again in,
is a big fan of you.

1035
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,820
Um,
he's,

1036
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,210
I mean,
I don't know if you're familiar with,

1037
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:41,820
and he's a big important part of the 
show and it's really cool guy.

1038
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,680
We like him a lot.
In,

1039
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,710
would you like to say anything to a GB?
Harrison's?

1040
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:48,120
We've got her on the phone.
I know you're a fan.

1041
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,550
Yeah,

1042
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:55,550
seriously.
In when he was just up the good work.

1043
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,480
I can't hear you.
We can't hear you.

1044
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,970
They hear you.
Can everyone oh yeah,

1045
00:54:58,971 --> 00:54:59,281

1046
00:54:59,281 --> 00:55:02,880
He's like keep up the great work and,
and also,

1047
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,030
and also Ian was wondering if you're 
single.

1048
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,950
I'm not,
I'm so sorry to burst that bubble.

1049
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:11,983
Sorry.
Yeah.

1050
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,630
Well we appreciate you.
We,

1051
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:17,070
uh,
I appreciate,

1052
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:19,830
you know,
ken on the phone and talking with us.

1053
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,090
Um,
and yeah,

1054
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,310
bringing some clarity because it is 
interesting.

1055
00:55:23,311 --> 00:55:24,060
It's wild.
It's so,

1056
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,930
it's weird,
like,

1057
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:26,980
like you acknowledged from the outside.
It's,

1058
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:27,814
it's strange,
but I have to tell you that I do when I 

1059
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:34,140
put it on,
you know,

1060
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,420
you do kind of,
it is nice.

1061
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:37,950
It is nice.
You know.

1062
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,300
Oh,
I wanted to ask you,

1063
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,770
I was going to say,
you said you liked it.

1064
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:41,131
Yeah,
yeah,

1065
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:41,791
I do.
Kind of like,

1066
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,710
yeah.
And is there a,

1067
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:47,340
do you know if there was a,
the opposite kind?

1068
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,080
People hate waste brine.

1069
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:50,160
Okay.

1070
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,570
Yes.
I think that's Microphonia.

1071
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:54,750
I think that's,
you know,

1072
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,550
there's two types of people in the world
because some people,

1073
00:55:57,551 --> 00:55:58,201
you know,
like you,

1074
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:00,970
you hear the sounds and you get like the
tingling feeling and it's like,

1075
00:56:00,971 --> 00:56:01,804
oh,
this is really nice.

1076
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,580
Some people hear the sounds and they're 
like,

1077
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:04,930
I wanna die.
Exactly.

1078
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,550
Like me.
Yeah.

1079
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,680
The smell period.
Blood or you don't,

1080
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,630
yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

1081
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,120
Well,
what do you,

1082
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,570
you know,
I'm not that.

1083
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:15,830
I feel like I wanna die when I see our 
channel.

1084
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,773
Not at all,
but my initial reaction will this 

1085
00:56:20,261 --> 00:56:21,130
trigger.
Yeah.

1086
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:23,740
When I think of someone we spring is 
pleasant.

1087
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,633
Sure.

1088
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:28,330
Um,
I don't necessarily feel tingles,

1089
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:32,320
but I do feel kind of like a lightness 
and a pleasant sensation,

1090
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,260
you know?
It's like extra relaxation.

1091
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:35,981
Yeah.
It's nice.

1092
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:37,360
It is nice to hear though.
You're going to do some,

1093
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,380
yeah.
A Smr for me to can't,

1094
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:43,990
do you ever do a one like for your 
boyfriend?

1095
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:46,540
Would you ever do like a one person Acmr
sesh?

1096
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,710
He doesn't get a Smr that was like super
unfortunate.

1097
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:56,110
Oh,
it's like beet red out here.

1098
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,310
Well,
I feel like,

1099
00:56:59,311 --> 00:57:01,480
um,
that's kind of ironic I guess.

1100
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:04,180
And unfortunate that your boyfriend 
doesn't experience any,

1101
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:07,560
some more.
I feel like that's going to expert for a

1102
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:09,070
girl could have been something there.
Yeah,

1103
00:57:09,071 --> 00:57:13,140
it could have been some great there,
but it would be interesting to do like a

1104
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:16,710
one person Acmr show or like you could 
actually like,

1105
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,720
it's almost like a massage in a way.
Like if you have like a,

1106
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:21,870
a a cmr therapy.
Right.

1107
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,100
That's interesting.
Why not?

1108
00:57:23,101 --> 00:57:25,140
Yeah.
I his growing it exists already.

1109
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,910
It exists,
Huh?

1110
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,113
Yeah.
That was the smr spa that keeps popping 

1111
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:30,334
up.
There's some of that.

1112
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:33,820
And then some in New York it's called 
like a whisper lodge I think.

1113
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:34,763
Whoa.

1114
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:36,371
Yeah.
Yeah.

1115
00:57:36,371 --> 00:57:37,204
So people are really exploring with it 
now and experimenting and doing live 

1116
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:41,050
shows and things like that.

1117
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,153
Do you think it will ever become 
mainstream or is it going to be 

1118
00:57:43,361 --> 00:57:45,400
something that's always hard to explain 
to people?

1119
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,273
Cool.

1120
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,990
If I compare it to a couple of years 
ago,

1121
00:57:49,991 --> 00:57:53,350
like it is crazy mainstream now compared
to,

1122
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,283
so I think it's really only going,
I'm in because every time it sort of 

1123
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:57,784
comes up in the media,
we get more people in the community who 

1124
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:00,461
are like,
oh my God,

1125
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:01,810
wait,
this is really relaxing.

1126
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:03,390
Yeah.
We've,

1127
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,270
we've even seen like Howard stern talk 
about it.

1128
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,050
Um,
and all this celebrity doing it.

1129
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:09,884
It's like,
yeah,

1130
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:11,610
as mainstream as he gets not.
Yup.

1131
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,580
I wonder if there is anything you'd like
Ai Mar that was so weird,

1132
00:58:14,581 --> 00:58:18,090
but now I was like our seemed so weird 
but it's now fully accepted by everyone.

1133
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:19,770
Okay.

1134
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:20,603
Right.
A lot of people didn't get like twitch 

1135
00:58:21,781 --> 00:58:23,070
when I came out.
Like gaming,

1136
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,121
like live straight.
They're like,

1137
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:25,860
why would you want to watch somebody 
play video games?

1138
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:28,243
Jimmy can make that joke.
And we were like a really tiny like 

1139
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,230
that.
So all right.

1140
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,810
Just last night.
Yeah.

1141
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:36,910
All right.
Oh my God,

1142
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,870
that's so weird.
We have got G,

1143
00:58:39,871 --> 00:58:40,451
B,
a,

1144
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:40,711
s,
m,

1145
00:58:40,711 --> 00:58:41,251
a R,
G,

1146
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,580
I b.
I a s Smr.

1147
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,660
Check her out.
She is the best in the game.

1148
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,480
Um,
I've listened.

1149
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:49,403
It's,
I get,

1150
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,450
I feel it's nice.
It's relaxing.

1151
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,210
He is a huge,
huge fan and,

1152
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:56,460
um,
we wish you all the very best.

1153
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:58,200
Yeah.
And uh,

1154
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:00,450
thank you by the blessing weekend as 
well too.

1155
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:01,890
So thank you for God.
Thank you.

1156
00:59:01,891 --> 00:59:02,810
You too.
Thank you.

1157
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,650
All right.
Take care.

1158
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:05,730
Appreciate you.
All right.

1159
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:07,620
Bye.
All right.

1160
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:11,010
That was g,
b a s m.

1161
00:59:11,011 --> 00:59:11,844
R.
And so we learned a lot from GB 

1162
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:15,570
dentally.
Yeah.

1163
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,813
It was interesting that she acknowledged
that it is because I thought she was 

1164
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,770
refuting that it's like it is not sexual
or not sexual,

1165
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:27,470
but like intimate or a lot like a lot of
guys are like,

1166
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,950
like the intimacy,
not sexual,

1167
00:59:30,951 --> 00:59:31,784
but like intimate.
But she did acknowledge that it's that 

1168
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,810
and it's more,
which I think I agree,

1169
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:37,423
but,
um,

1170
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,280
she's a professional,
you know.

1171
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,800
Yeah.
So there you go.

1172
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:47,340
There you have it.
Gb a smr.

1173
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,950
All right.
Ian,

1174
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:49,800
how was that for you?

1175
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:57,250
Yeah,
like his parents.

1176
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:58,573
That was incredible.
Can't I can't hear him through the 

1177
01:00:00,381 --> 01:00:02,600
speaker.
Oh,

1178
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:03,860
there you go.
Yeah,

1179
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:08,060
that was incredibly embarrassing.
And I was trying to talk,

1180
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:09,920
it wasn't working.
That didn't help.

1181
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,593
But you do find her attractive right in?
I think she's very talented or what she 

1182
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:17,090
does great.
Such a diplomat.

1183
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:21,460
He didn't like it's okay though.
But she does have a boyfriend,

1184
01:00:21,461 --> 01:00:23,930
Ian.
So we do a lot to you guys for that.

1185
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,300
Take it easy.
Um,

1186
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:28,990
she's cool.
Yeah,

1187
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,850
moving on.
It makes me wish that I enjoyed it.

1188
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,960
I feel like I'm missing out.
Have you tried though?

1189
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:40,040
You know,
I just know that I don't like,

1190
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,993
cause I actually,
I gave it like a good shot for five or 

1191
01:00:42,651 --> 01:00:45,260
10 minutes and I was very pleasant.
It was nice.

1192
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:49,910
And then cause like I was watching like 
a cute girl and I was like,

1193
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:54,000
okay,
I'm going to find a dude and I,

1194
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:54,883
and there's this one,
I showed it like a gnarly bearded dude 

1195
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,140
and he's like insane.

1196
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:03,980
Like he's all over the place and that 
guy is like a king.

1197
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,400
So I wanted to be like,
all right,

1198
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:08,990
it's not about that.
But yeah,

1199
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,150
that guy was,
was just as good.

1200
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,870
But also you're not really supposed to 
watch it.

1201
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,460
You're supposed to just listen.
Right.

1202
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,870
Put it in the background.
Yeah.

1203
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,170
Let's be frank.
Being cute helps you in any field.

1204
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,330
That's true.
If I was more handsome,

1205
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,253
you think that I wouldn't have 20 
million subscribers if I wasn't more 

1206
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:28,850
handsome.
You think that pure that I wouldn't have

1207
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,090
more subscribers and cutie pie.
He's handsome.

1208
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:35,150
That's why he has 60 million.
All right.

1209
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,250
I mean,
well,

1210
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,390
it's well known,
Mike.

1211
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,170
When actors the attractive,
they say it.

1212
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:44,690
The first rule of dating,
be attractive.

1213
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:47,510
Second rule of dating.
Don't be unattractive.

1214
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,650
Third rule,
ask them if they smile on their period.

1215
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,490
Third Rural,
sniff the period blood,

1216
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,430
the sniff test as it's called.

1217
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:58,250
Why wasn't there a Seinfeld about period
blood?

1218
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:03,560
Ah,
you're slipping actually.

1219
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:05,180
Well,
the differences about the same.

1220
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,130
Eight,
10% yes.

1221
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:09,510
14% no.
Yeah,

1222
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:12,230
six to 8%.
I'm into it.

1223
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,890
I love it.
I love that additional amazing.

1224
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,270
I love it.
Um,

1225
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:19,440
all right.
Moving on.

1226
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,273
Elon musk is that we've,
this is an incredible story that needs 

1227
01:02:23,131 --> 01:02:23,964
to be shared with the world.
He was banned recently for two from 

1228
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:28,404
twitter because he was shit posting so 
hard that twitter was sure he was 

1229
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:33,533
hacked,
is security was compromised and they 

1230
01:02:35,281 --> 01:02:37,080
said there's no way.
These are genuine tweets.

1231
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:40,050
We need to shut this down.
They were real quick.

1232
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:44,700
So let's see,
what was it that got him banned?

1233
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,610
He first begins with Iheart anime.
450,000

1234
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:55,611
likes.
I own H G v Wolverine now,

1235
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:57,330
by the way,
did you feel about it?

1236
01:02:57,331 --> 01:02:58,164
Cause you're,
you have any man and you're a fan of 

1237
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,070
everyone.
I love anime.

1238
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,860
So do you love him in a more,
even more than Whoa.

1239
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,980
He's just shit posting.
I do.

1240
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:10,710
I do like him less and I don't like him 
less.

1241
01:03:10,711 --> 01:03:13,050
I just think,
I just don't know what,

1242
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,480
what's with the tweeting.
I just don't really get him like,

1243
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,160
like he's

1244
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:26,220
so I guess I just don't why he's trying 
to be like an edge Lord.

1245
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,040
All of a sudden it's like a midlife 
crisis.

1246
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:30,540
Maybe.
It's like,

1247
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:32,730
dude,
you're the coolest fucking greatest dude

1248
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:34,320
ever.
You don't need to ship post on it.

1249
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:35,370
And I have to try.
Yeah.

1250
01:03:35,371 --> 01:03:36,900
You don't need to try.
I mean,

1251
01:03:36,901 --> 01:03:38,610
it doesn't make me like,
I think it's funny.

1252
01:03:38,611 --> 01:03:39,720
I think.
I think that,

1253
01:03:39,721 --> 01:03:41,880
um,
I like him just as much as I ever did.

1254
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:44,450
I love Elon Musk.
Um,

1255
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:48,240
I support him and his company's 100% and
I as well.

1256
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:53,040
I just don't know what,
you know,

1257
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:57,210
it's just a little unnecessary maybe.
But yeah.

1258
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:00,420
And then he tweets his favorite anime.
Love your name.

1259
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:03,750
I haven't actually seen this one,
but apparently it's like a drama.

1260
01:04:03,751 --> 01:04:04,670
I don't really like,
um,

1261
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,440
who's best.
I don't really like anime dramas.

1262
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,370
I like to see that.

1263
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,283
Okay.

1264
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,580
I like,
like action enemies because for me it's,

1265
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:16,830
I like the fantasy aspect.
I like the magic.

1266
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:18,720
I'm making the power.
That's what I need to watch.

1267
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:19,890
A drama.
Anime.

1268
01:04:19,891 --> 01:04:23,190
I can watch drama in any form.
Cartoons.

1269
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,203
It's not real.
That's why you get sick ass fucking 

1270
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:29,130
magical powers because you can't 
actually do that in real life.

1271
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,090
Skip.
Um,

1272
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:36,000
so acts that one elon calls himself Ilan
Chan.

1273
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:41,880
Elan musk is a weep and he re re ponds.
Ahem.

1274
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:45,930
Ilan Chan.
What?

1275
01:04:45,931 --> 01:04:49,560
I mean like where is he picking up this 
terminology?

1276
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,010
Just trolls read at all day.
And I'm saying,

1277
01:04:53,011 --> 01:04:54,810
well,
like what form is he spending?

1278
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:55,823
Because the problem that,
that makes me concerned is the people 

1279
01:04:57,601 --> 01:04:58,434
that talk with these kinds of means,
people who like joke around like this 

1280
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:08,010
are not the people that I want getting 
inside Elan Musk beautiful,

1281
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:10,200
pristine braid,
right?

1282
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:15,720
Like I don't want him spending time on 
four Chan or Anamae subreddits.

1283
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:21,610
That's maybe that's what it concerns me.
It's more what it means.

1284
01:05:21,611 --> 01:05:23,800
That what he's,
why does he know all this stuff?

1285
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,990
Like you can what you can.
I like anime,

1286
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:28,230
but I'm not,
you're not.

1287
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,630
And it wouldn't be more fun for me by 
the way,

1288
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:35,560
that Elon Musk,
we need his brain to be in good,

1289
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:36,670
clean,
pristine,

1290
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:40,210
beautiful shape,
not Ahem Ilan Chin.

1291
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,373
Like wherever he learned that I don't 
want him there and I'm not going to 

1292
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,840
genesis even going.
And that's amazing.

1293
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,910
And I'm not,
what'd you say?

1294
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,133
I just notice that the meme that I don't
know if he posted or somebody else 

1295
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:54,930
below,
but what?

1296
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:58,110
It's an elan below,
you know,

1297
01:05:58,190 --> 01:05:59,710
it's uh,
uh,

1298
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:02,740
it was whatever you,
I mean it's whatever.

1299
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,000
Okay,
thank you Dan.

1300
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,003
Oh,
this,

1301
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:09,100
I don't know that or the origins of this
one.

1302
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:12,040
It's just a pawn off of a famous 
animator.

1303
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,700
Um,
so ian along continues.

1304
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:16,534
Hey,
what's going on with two factor for 

1305
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:18,364
Tesla Account,
which is weird cause it's actually like 

1306
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:24,940
a business related question though.
It's not directed to the right place.

1307
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:28,690
So justifiably he says you want to buy 
some Bitcoin,

1308
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,820
which I think was probably when twitter 
was like,

1309
01:06:33,821 --> 01:06:38,821
this shit's weird again on,
I don't know where you,

1310
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,253
what's going on?
What forms your browsing and we got to 

1311
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:47,434
keep your brain beautiful.
Noninfected and I'm not criticizing the 

1312
01:06:49,961 --> 01:06:51,700
people that do spend their times in that
form.

1313
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:55,660
I'm just saying some people we need to 
protect you.

1314
01:06:55,661 --> 01:06:58,660
Elon musk is one of those people,
you know,

1315
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:00,543
I'm a cat girl.
What is this shit keeps getting weirder 

1316
01:07:01,991 --> 01:07:03,580
every time I click here.
Okay.

1317
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,040
Show us your bows at cos play.
He says,

1318
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:12,400
actually I'm actually cat girl.
Here's a selfie right now.

1319
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:17,380
Okay.
Now your twitter right now,

1320
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:19,540
what's your call?
Suspend or keep open.

1321
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,870
Exactly.
I can see where they came from.

1322
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:23,943
Twitter ends up spending is suspending 
as account because he assumed he was 

1323
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:30,520
hacked.
And then finally we end on,

1324
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:34,600
um,
send me your dankest memes.

1325
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:35,434
He tweeted what the fuck?
And then pheidippides said meme review 

1326
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:43,420
when he said midnight.
I don't think that happened.

1327
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,480
Elon Musk.
There you go.

1328
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:50,020
What a world.
What a world we live in.

1329
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:52,600
You know what I'm saying?
My God.

1330
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,550
But I will say on the,
on the uh,

1331
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:59,470
on a beautiful positive note of Elan's 
Tesla,

1332
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:04,730
the be the most exciting progressive,
um,

1333
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:11,310
risk taking future forward company that 
this world has seen in so long.

1334
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,753
Tesla,
the automaker of electric cars has 

1335
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:20,480
finally become,
they're there.

1336
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,373
They have blasted the expectation.
Everyone was expecting them to lose 

1337
01:08:24,111 --> 01:08:24,471
those,
those,

1338
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:25,304
those,
those money,

1339
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:27,530
they were expected to lose 19 cents per 
share.

1340
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:32,800
Their quarterly earnings came in.
It went up $2 and 90 cents per share.

1341
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,020
They made a profit for the first time 
ever.

1342
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:37,683
Smash expectations.
Model three is become the best selling 

1343
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:42,314
car in the United States.
In terms of revenue and the fifth best 

1344
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:49,640
selling car in terms of volume,
the most revenue,

1345
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,730
best salad car in the United States.
Unbelievable.

1346
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,860
The model three.
These guys,

1347
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:56,360
I love Tesla,
everything.

1348
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:57,203
You know what?
I'm so happy that they're making it and 

1349
01:08:58,941 --> 01:09:01,130
they're making money and they're turning
a profit.

1350
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:05,050
That's pretty amazing.
I mean especially here in La,

1351
01:09:05,051 --> 01:09:07,900
you see it everywhere now.
Everywhere.

1352
01:09:07,901 --> 01:09:09,490
Dude,
brand new model three is everywhere.

1353
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:13,810
I have a lease on a s N it's open a year
and I'm going to,

1354
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:15,123
I think I'm going to get a model three 
but I find it so amazing that as a 

1355
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:23,921
company they released the model three 
with same features even better and for a

1356
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:27,150
lower price.

1357
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:27,983
The thing is the model three,
the performance version of the model 

1358
01:09:31,021 --> 01:09:36,021
three is way less than the model s that 
I have and it's faster,

1359
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,170
has a longer,
any longer battery life.

1360
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:42,510
Which of the two things I care the most 
about?

1361
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,330
[inaudible] it's a little smaller,
but I don't really give a fuck.

1362
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,580
Most people,
but it's more modern.

1363
01:09:47,581 --> 01:09:50,200
It's more futuristic.
That's why it's going to be so huge.

1364
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:54,160
The model,
the model three performance is like,

1365
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:58,240
the craziest version you can get is like
$70,000.

1366
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:00,610
I know that's probably sounds like a lot
to most of you,

1367
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:06,060
but comparable cars that go that speed 
could be like 10 times that price.

1368
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

1369
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:12,430
Like a model three,
it goes zero to 60 and like,

1370
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:16,210
um,
like three seconds.

1371
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:22,290
The closest thing of that is like crazy,
like porsches and Maseratis and shit.

1372
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,920
You're looking at two or 300,000
plus hours,

1373
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:26,390
70,000
bucks,

1374
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:31,830
and it's got like 320 miles per charge.
But then it's just,

1375
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,040
it has so much more,
and this is not a commercial.

1376
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,193
No,
everyone knows that I am as long they 

1377
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,633
don't need to pay anyone how far past 
everything else because the auto drive 

1378
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,310
is so useful and then it's fully 
electric.

1379
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,750
But the real,
the real thing,

1380
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:50,240
the real genius too is the 
infrastructure they've built.

1381
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,793
There's so many superchargers now that 
you can actually go on a long distance 

1382
01:10:55,011 --> 01:10:55,844
drive,
which we've done many times and charge 

1383
01:10:57,561 --> 01:11:00,920
your car fast and reliably.
Is that,

1384
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,950
is that the case outside of California?
Yeah.

1385
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:04,571
Yeah,
yeah.

1386
01:11:04,571 --> 01:11:06,900
Just anywhere you can drive across to,
yeah.

1387
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:08,360
Huh.
You can do a road trip.

1388
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:09,170
That is really impressive.

1389
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,003
I mean that's the main,
that's the main hurdle that everybody 

1390
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,363
cross country for a long time we drove 
to vegas and they're adding more and 

1391
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:18,860
more every,
you know,

1392
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,810
all the time.
But uh,

1393
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:21,733
yeah,
lots of people drive cross country and 

1394
01:11:22,761 --> 01:11:24,890
their teslas now.
It's wild.

1395
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,990
It's really cool.
Um,

1396
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,570
so that's cool.
And uh,

1397
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,593
and anyway,
I will be sending my dankest memes to 

1398
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:37,671
Elon Musk who congratulate him on his 
excellent performance.

1399
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:40,040
So,
um,

1400
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,220
what else we got here?
I got a lot of videos,

1401
01:11:43,221 --> 01:11:48,050
but I'm so fricking owned.
My throat is so fucked.

1402
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,980
I wasn't even a show how you were going 
to do this.

1403
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:55,390
I wasn't sure either because when we 
first started this I was like delirious.

1404
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,700
I was saying something to Isla.
She's like,

1405
01:11:57,701 --> 01:11:59,680
I don't even understand what you're 
telling me right now.

1406
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:00,610
And I was like,
all right,

1407
01:12:00,611 --> 01:12:01,580
well let's go live.

1408
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,770
I hope you are comfortable talking today
cause I can't,

1409
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:08,520
that it's true.
It really happened.

1410
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:09,523
My throat really hurts.
So I probably shouldn't talk that much 

1411
01:12:11,061 --> 01:12:11,894
because it's not going to help.
Spending 14 hours at Disney yesterday 

1412
01:12:16,581 --> 01:12:17,414
was not helpful,
but we were planning that trip for a 

1413
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:23,480
year so I would be,
God damn if I wasn't going.

1414
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,191
Um,
let me see.

1415
01:12:25,191 --> 01:12:26,024
I'll save this stuff for next week and 
hopefully maybe we could get tom and 

1416
01:12:29,591 --> 01:12:31,510
Christina next week.
Oh yeah,

1417
01:12:31,511 --> 01:12:35,590
that'll totally reschedule cause I saw 
some people worry.

1418
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,553
I hope we can do it next week because I 
have so many great videos I want to 

1419
01:12:38,001 --> 01:12:40,430
watch with them.
Um,

1420
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:44,390
I've got questions but a lot of them,
more videos.

1421
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:48,800
Um,
the period blood we talked about,

1422
01:12:48,801 --> 01:12:52,520
obviously,
congratulations.

1423
01:12:52,521 --> 01:12:55,100
What is this one?
Well I think technique,

1424
01:12:55,101 --> 01:12:58,310
this guy said this was funny from that 
by the way.

1425
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,550
Questions,
videos,

1426
01:12:59,551 --> 01:13:00,980
suggestions,
anything.

1427
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,610
Send them to 
podcast@hthreehthreeproductions.com.

1428
01:13:04,611 --> 01:13:08,060
Love to hear from you guys.
This one comes from Andrew Bentley.

1429
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:14,260
He said he learned about the wiping 
technique and he tried it out.

1430
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:15,913
But unfortunately on my third try with 
front wiping it ended in such tragedy 

1431
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:20,903
had revert back to back wiping while I 
was trying to utilize the scoop 

1432
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,420
technique.
Um,

1433
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:27,613
my,
my wrist accidentally make contact with 

1434
01:13:29,511 --> 01:13:30,860
Poo Poo,
pee water.

1435
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:32,863
And needless to say,
it's solidified my trust and the tried 

1436
01:13:35,001 --> 01:13:38,390
and true method of bandwidth.
And how do you get,

1437
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:41,150
he says,
unfortunately I have to conclude Ethan's

1438
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:44,380
wiping method is too dangerous.
Second.

1439
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:47,960
Well what the fuck?
How deep are yapping?

1440
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:52,670
Like when I not,
when I say you have to lift your balls.

1441
01:13:52,671 --> 01:13:55,850
I'm not kidding dude.
Do you have to like lean back though?

1442
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:56,743
No.
Do you cup your balls when you wipe for 

1443
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:03,220
a back to front on a little unit but you
grow.

1444
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:04,363
I mean you have to like grab your Dick 
and balls right in one hand you can go 

1445
01:14:08,691 --> 01:14:12,550
around and doesn't not like talking.
Well,

1446
01:14:12,551 --> 01:14:15,580
the way I do it because I live my junk 
with one hand,

1447
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:19,600
I stretch it up and I,
I don't dunk into the toilet,

1448
01:14:19,601 --> 01:14:20,650
that's for sure.
I mean,

1449
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:21,723
yeah,
obviously keep your hand out of the 

1450
01:14:22,451 --> 01:14:23,320
toilet bowl,
dude.

1451
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,310
I mean my God,
the mechanic we need,

1452
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:28,173
we need to like get a life sized 
mannequin and like have like a full on 

1453
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:33,370
demonstration.
Don't need a mannequin.

1454
01:14:33,371 --> 01:14:38,371
I'll show you right now.
You bring this up and you just,

1455
01:14:38,501 --> 01:14:41,900
you scoop right under like that.
You got your leg up right now though.

1456
01:14:41,901 --> 01:14:44,800
And see this is one of in objects.
He's actually,

1457
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:47,650
he's got a different technique.
Do you want to come show us the yet come

1458
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:52,160
show us.
Come in here cause he in.

1459
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:53,730
Oh God,
you're,

1460
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:54,993
yeah,
you're being so lamb come shows how you 

1461
01:14:55,931 --> 01:14:56,764
wipe your ass.

1462
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:01,180
Come on,
get in here.

1463
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:06,350
Why do your legs and then side around 
you go directly under.

1464
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:06,941
Wait,
what?

1465
01:15:06,941 --> 01:15:08,140
How do you go?
You Go,

1466
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,213
you go under the balls.
I spread the legs wider and go around 

1467
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:15,364
round.
He goes around the mountain like crimp 

1468
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:21,090
here.
Sure.

1469
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:24,040
Come show us.
Come on.

1470
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:26,380
I'm genuinely curious.
This is the science episode.

1471
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,320
You're shaking his head.
No way too embarrassed.

1472
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:33,220
I'm not blaming you.
Hold on.

1473
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,083
Okay,
well at least let me understand because 

1474
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:38,200
now I'm intrigued.
You go from like this?

1475
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:39,910
No,
you go from the front.

1476
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:45,370
So you come like from like this,
I can't see,

1477
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:52,100
oh you open your wet legs,
wider leg like super wide.

1478
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,140
Right,
right,

1479
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:56,280
right.
And you don't go under him.

1480
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,123
You go around them,
you sit like super while you got 

1481
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,230
homework to do it.
Wait,

1482
01:16:02,231 --> 01:16:04,740
hold on.
Do Shit with your legs that wide.

1483
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,180
That's a wide stance he got.
I don't go that wide.

1484
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:15,243
Oh I understand.
So you scope it your Dick and balls to 

1485
01:16:17,591 --> 01:16:22,591
like the left because I put them up 
against my gut and you say Whoa,

1486
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:27,070
I'm trying to understanding cause you're
not coming in here and showing me.

1487
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:28,823
All right.
I'm tired of playing pictionary with to 

1488
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:33,880
the solidarity between the front wipers.
Is is cracking.

1489
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:35,533
You're the worst uh,
pictionary partner I've ever had 

1490
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:40,860
switching to back after that.
No.

1491
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,370
All right,
well I've got a conversion.

1492
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,010
He gets mad at me today.
Embarrassed and a little bit,

1493
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:52,370
but um,
her boyfriend doesn't even feel Acmr III

1494
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,213
and so there is a chance and I think I 
did lay a skewed either shaking her 

1495
01:16:58,511 --> 01:17:00,340
head.
I'm very disappointed.

1496
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:04,810
I what else we got.
So that's about it.

1497
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:05,883
I have a lot of other submissions,
but I think I'll save it with the 

1498
01:17:07,841 --> 01:17:11,420
hopeful,
hopeful that Tom and Christina will come

1499
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:13,010
next week.
So again,

1500
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:13,873
uh,
somewhat,

1501
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:15,740
um,
light episode.

1502
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:16,603
I'm very sick.
I should stop talking immediately and 

1503
01:17:17,901 --> 01:17:18,734
get in bed.
You are a champion for powering through 

1504
01:17:21,081 --> 01:17:22,880
this too.
When you walked in today,

1505
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,080
I took one look at,
he was like,

1506
01:17:24,081 --> 01:17:25,670
fuck that dude is,
it should be in bed.

1507
01:17:25,671 --> 01:17:27,320
Right.
Thank you for saying that Dan.

1508
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:30,640
The show must go on.
You know,

1509
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:31,873
the show must go on and I'm,
and I appreciate everybody who tuned in 

1510
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:37,064
on this blessing lesson Friday and I 
appreciate all the boys and back who I 

1511
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:46,790
want to always express my appreciation 
to Dan,

1512
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,930
the producer and interns,
Zach the sound boy,

1513
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,053
love them all.
They're all work so hard to make the 

1514
01:17:54,561 --> 01:17:56,000
show great.
And uh,

1515
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:57,763
you know,
cheers to them and I hope that in with 

1516
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:04,530
the his new,
I think there's this,

1517
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:06,770
I think there was a spark between him 
and Juvie.

1518
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:07,873
I really do.
So I'm looking forward to see how that 

1519
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:13,190
develops.
End Up lesson blessing weekend.

1520
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:14,660
It's Friday.
My Dude's.

1521
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,920
Yeah,
it's a beautiful thing.

1522
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,710
And of course,
huge appreciation.

1523
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:26,240
So all you Ngozi boys who come and spend
your day with us.

1524
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,730
I hope I've entertained too.
I hope you've laughed.

1525
01:18:28,731 --> 01:18:33,320
Hope you've thought I did not intend to 
make you cry.

1526
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:35,930
So I hope you didn't cry,
but if you did,

1527
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,213
I don't know why it wasn't my fault.
Here's a boy tears of joy from laughing 

1528
01:18:40,191 --> 01:18:43,770
so hard and enjoying herself so much.
All right.

1529
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:47,370
Make sure to burp rag.
Hit me with it.

1530
01:18:47,371 --> 01:18:49,880
So here it comes.
Here it comes.

Really ant,

That was such a great video discovery.

01:19:10,981 --> 01:19:11,814
It's crazy.
