You've been,

35
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:33,380
maybe I'm just not your type,
but maybe I look like a guy.

36
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,000
Try it at least.
Yeah,

37
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,280
true.
Already have netflix.

38
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,290
Everybody has,
you know,

39
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,170
he's talking about this recently 
fucking,

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,770
I think they almost have 200 million 
people on Netflix now.

41
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,330
So it's like over half the country.
So I did.

42
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:47,801
I know.
Yeah,

43
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:50,330
it's crazy.
So I did like a year and a half ago,

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,870
they had a party for 100 million 
subscribers.

45
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:55,490
It was half a year ago.
No,

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,110
a year.
Like a year and a half ago.

47
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,060
Oh my God.
They're growing fast and,

48
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,330
and they were like,
they,

49
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,950
they hit up my manager and they were 
like,

50
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,320
does Chris want to perform for the 
party?

51
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,890
And it was like,
no,

52
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:11,390
it's going to be a fucking train wreck.
But I was like,

53
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,980
yeah,
I'm not gonna say it.

54
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,441
No.
Well,

55
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:15,370
what's your hesitation you're performing
to just the Netflix?

56
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,870
It was like,
Hey,

57
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,130
uh,
well,

58
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,530
yeah,
and friends and people that were invited

59
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:22,940
to the party.
It's a special event,

60
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,610
but it's just like,
it's just,

61
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,060
I knew just anytime as a comedian,
people are like,

62
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,760
you want to perform it,
this thing that's not in a comedy club.

63
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:32,720
Right.
You're like,

64
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,720
okay,
I'm not going to be right.

65
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,210
It's not going to be amazing,
you know?

66
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,450
But so,
uh,

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,320
so I was like,
well,

68
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:41,090
I don't want to say no to them and I 
love Netflix.

69
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:42,350
So,
and I worked for them,

70
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:43,041
so I was like,
yeah,

71
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,090
I'll fucking do it,
you know?

72
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,590
And we made it fun.
It was fun.

73
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:46,424
It was me and three other comedians 
cannot remember who one of the other 

74
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:53,150
comedians were.
That's how it was a crazy,

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,273
but it was,
it was,

76
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,460
it was fun.
We made it fun.

77
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:59,830
It was like in this room off to the side
where other bands were playing too.

78
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,940
So he like,
you heard you were,

79
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,100
he had this crazy,
it was like I would have to do it.

80
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,650
That knows how to party.
I know they go,

81
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,010
oh,
it was huge.

82
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,330
It was huge.
And um,

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,440
we were doing,
it was like,

84
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:11,190
it brought me back to the open mic days 
when I was doing,

85
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
I'm like,
I will play bowling alleys.

86
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,160
It doesn't sound,
I mean dude,

87
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:15,994
you play by play.
I played bowling alleys where like you 

88
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:22,210
would compete with people who were 
bowling in between pins.

89
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,073
You'll try to time like the punch line 
in between like after they are right 

90
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,160
before they,
it would go with the kids.

91
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,110
Is that the worst show you've ever done 
in a bowling alley?

92
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,610
No.
Uh,

93
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,920
no.
What's,

94
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,610
what happened?
The worst show I ever did.

95
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:38,380
I talk about it and incorrigible is 
when,

96
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,243
uh,
well the worst kind of like show coming 

97
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,344
up that I did was we're a lady rushed 
the stage and it was because she was 

98
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,720
heckling me and,
uh,

99
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,593
I said to her,
she had like this really like wild hair 

100
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,793
that was like really up and out and I,
and I called her Blanca after she was 

101
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:01,320
like,
you know,

102
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,810
three fighter.

103
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,643
Yeah,
of course.

104
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,850
I don't know if,
and she,

105
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:04,684
I was like,
I don't even know what she's going to 

106
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,480
know what this means.
And I did.

107
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,770
And she knew what it meant.
She was very,

108
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:13,400
so she ran right up and grabbed the 
microphone and hit my face,

109
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:15,340
like pushed it into my face and I was 
like,

110
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:16,174
Oh God,
I gotta say of all of the insults that 

111
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:19,414
would cause someone to attack you,
the street fighter reference pretty 

112
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,160
special one.
It's a good one.

113
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,340
And it just kind of proved my point 
because I'd be like,

114
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,890
I feel like that's kind of what Blanca 
would've done.

115
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,090
Like Shit.
Yeah.

116
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,740
You some of those sparks.
Yeah,

117
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,131
yeah,
yeah,

118
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:32,790
yeah,
yeah.

119
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,570
Like eating my,
what was that one where he ate the guy's

120
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,261
head.
Right.

121
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:38,951
Of course.
Hey,

122
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:40,120
whatever.
If he would've done that.

123
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,691
Yeah.
Well,

124
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:41,110
you,
we,

125
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,870
I realized we've been podcasting for 
about the same really because you,

126
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,843
this is what episode is the [inaudible] 
70 [inaudible] 71 71 I think I'm up to 

127
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:50,200
74.

128
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,830
So yeah,
it's been like three weeks or three week

129
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,800
difference.
I'm curious,

130
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:57,220
how is podcasting like affected your 
stand up in a way?

131
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,990
Kind of,
it's been really,

132
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:02,740
actually,
it's been really interesting because I,

133
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,601
you know,
I,

134
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,310
I started a podcast after I had a 
following.

135
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:06,881
Right,
right.

136
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,040
And what would you guys did too?
And so,

137
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,050
um,
and uh,

138
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,840
and I did,
so I was like,

139
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,733
look,
I'm just going to do this and see how 

140
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,060
long it lasts.
You know,

141
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:20,200
everyone's got a part.
I felt like,

142
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,153
you know,
I really found out through other 

143
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:24,730
comedians that if you don't have a 
podcast and you already have a fan base,

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,870
you're leaving money on the table.
So beyond that,

145
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:29,704
it's just a great way to connect.
But I didn't think of it that way until 

146
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,390
I started doing it.
I was like,

147
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,710
you know,
I was like,

148
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,573
I wanna,
I wanna make money more money and fuck 

149
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,560
it,
you know?

150
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,880
And then,
uh,

151
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,010
and then I realized once I started doing
it,

152
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,390
how much,
like,

153
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,000
I mean,
in a much smaller way,

154
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,650
for me at least,
it's like,

155
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,850
you know,
it's like a TV,

156
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,440
like the TV show,
the when,

157
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,450
when people are watching a TV show and 
they're like,

158
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,284
oh,
I've got to wait til next week to watch 

159
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:58,160
the next TV,
which we,

160
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,500
a lot of people binge watch now,
but when I was a kid,

161
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:01,334
that's how people used to watch TV and 
now people feel connected and they wait 

162
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:04,670
for the,
you know,

163
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,630
they feel like they know me more and 
they do because,

164
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:09,410
uh,
um,

165
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,041
I'm,
you know,

166
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,010
me or a version of me on that comedy,
the comedy podcasts.

167
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,060
Yeah.
Uh,

168
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,950
and um,
but yeah,

169
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,230
it really like,
makes them feel like they know you.

170
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:21,040
And that's kind of a double edge sword.
Sometimes you like it,

171
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,890
sometimes you don't,
but,

172
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,210
but um,
but it,

173
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:24,800
it,
it,

174
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,633
it as,
as I might have my opener when he says 

175
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:30,420
you guys listened to,
uh,

176
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,180
congratulations before it brings me up.

177
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,433
Um,
the chairs are just gotten bigger and 

178
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,680
bigger,
bigger throughout the whole,

179
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:36,590
throughout the past year.
Yeah.

180
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:37,870
It's really crazy.
It's really crazy.

181
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,850
Your podcast is different than ours and 
that you're just,

182
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,250
it's you and you're talking,
I mean,

183
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,084
how was that experience from going from 
standup to just like talking into a 

184
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,820
camera and nobody's there cause you do 
shows you act a lot,

185
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,683
right?
But was that a different skill to learn 

186
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:53,870
or did it kind of translate?
I,

187
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,180
you know what,
it's,

188
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,063
it's,
it's like standup in the way that like 

189
00:06:58,821 --> 00:06:59,654
stand up to me is a version of making.
Like when I'm at a diner with my 

190
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:05,850
friends,
late night,

191
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,900
I'm sometimes like,
you know,

192
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:09,850
doing jokes,
we're,

193
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:10,341
we're,
we're,

194
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:11,750
I mean we're always joking around,
messing around,

195
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:12,584
but like sometimes I'm just fucking with
them and we're just making jokes and 

196
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:16,760
we're doing bits or whatever.

197
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,760
I always felt like before I did stand 
up,

198
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:20,594
I was like,
if I could get to be onstage and treat 

199
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:26,000
the audience like they're the other 
people in the diner,

200
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,330
then I'll be able to do,
I know I'll be able to do it because I,

201
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,183
I,
I literally would do that every day of 

202
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:33,401
my life.
I,

203
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,234
I love,
I'm obsessed with truck trying to maybe 

204
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:35,724
have a laugh and like trying to and 
think of what w what do I think is 

205
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:39,410
funny,
what's funny about this situation.

206
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,543
And so for podcasting it was the same 
thing except that except like when I'm 

207
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:50,660
in my house and I'm with my dogs,
like I'll catch myself just like talking

208
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:53,300
about things for no reason.
Like I'm a fucking insane person.

209
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:54,590
And then,
and then I'm like,

210
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,240
oh well maybe I'll say that on my end,
my end,

211
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,740
my show or my act or whatever.

212
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,830
But then when I started to do the 
podcasts,

213
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:02,030
I was like,
oh,

214
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:05,210
this is just that.
This is just like me talking out loud in

215
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,670
my house.
And I kind of do that anyway.

216
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:10,250
I don't do it for a full hour,
like an insane person,

217
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:12,140
but like that's how I come up with 
material.

218
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:15,480
I just start like talking to my house 
and I think all that's funny.

219
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,620
This is material born from your podcast 
ever.

220
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:21,710
Does it only start and the podcast and 
then goes to the day it has for sure.

221
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:22,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

222
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,340
That's awesome.
Yeah,

223
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,020
it is.
Yeah.

224
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,750
Well,
it also helps me like creatively because

225
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:28,670
I don't like sit down and like right at 
the computer,

226
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,050
my act,
so like,

227
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,860
um,
well,

228
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,983
yeah,
because when you do your act as it very 

229
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,224
much rehearsed for me,
I'll go up with an idea that I have and 

230
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:39,890
all.

231
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,660
When you do man on fire,
which is like,

232
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,750
yeah,
yeah.

233
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,903
Well that's,
that's the act that I've been kind of 

234
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,241
honing.
Right.

235
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:46,730
Okay.
Right.

236
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,500
But you all,
but yeah.

237
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:53,501
But all of those bits came from and to 
me going on stage thinking like,

238
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,620
oh,
it's funny when guys work out,

239
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:57,420
I'll go on stage and start talking about
it.

240
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,690
Wow.
That's a wild way to approach it.

241
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:02,190
To kind of just go up there and be like,
all right,

242
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,280
let's see what's happening.
Yeah.

243
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,440
I mean,
I think,

244
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,430
I think though,
like so much of it is about,

245
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,691
like,
that's what I say,

246
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,810
if I go back,
going back to like being in a diner with

247
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:14,640
my friends,
I'm so comfortable with them,

248
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,560
they're my friends.
Do you know what I mean?

249
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,463
Yeah.
And I think through years and years of 

250
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,280
practicing through thousands and 
thousands of shows,

251
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,133
yeah.
I'm able to get into that headspace on 

252
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:25,970
stage.

253
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you know?
That's awesome.

254
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,100
So I,
and I love it.

255
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,140
I love doing it.
And it's,

256
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,850
you know,
there's an old saying like,

257
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:35,150
it's not what you say,
it's how you say it or,

258
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,761
uh,
and,

259
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:36,300
and uh,
you know,

260
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,060
I think it is if you're that confident.
And I mean,

261
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,730
like there's guys who,
my buddy Brian calendar,

262
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:42,564
it goes on stage.
He talks about horse shit for an hour 

263
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:45,510
and it's hilarious.
Yeah.

264
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,850
And it's not true,
but he acts like it is,

265
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:48,660
and it's,
it's,

266
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,820
you know.
Yeah.

267
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,110
So it's,
those guys are the,

268
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,100
I mean,
you know,

269
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,190
guys like that.
It's about how you say it.

270
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,490
That's cool.
I think that's a cool way to,

271
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,570
to just hone the skill just to get up in
the fucking gauntlet and yeah.

272
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,640
And get it down.
And it's a onetime dude.

273
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,200
One time I was on a plane.

274
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,320
I shit you not mad if somebody told me 
this.

275
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,210
I wouldn't have,
I wouldn't believe that,

276
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,730
but it happened to me on,
I know it happened to me.

277
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,940
And it's true because I know that 
because I witnessed it.

278
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,130
This almost sounds like a lie.
Yeah,

279
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:23,640
I know.
You know what reaffirmed that part of it

280
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:24,474
is because I have to,
I have to convince myself it actually 

281
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,874
how,
okay.

282
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,220
It's not nobody shit on the plane or 
anything like that,

283
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:30,540
but it's like,
so I'm,

284
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,720
we're going to Montreal,
which is a big festival in Montreal just

285
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:35,610
for laughs.
I'm doing it again this year,

286
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,980
but I went and,
uh,

287
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:38,601
the,
the,

288
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:41,100
they fly us up there and whenever you 
fly up there,

289
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:42,220
since it's,
uh,

290
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,160
uh,
stand up festival,

291
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:44,994
it's comedy festival.
There's always like nine comedians on 

292
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:47,970
your flight,
right?

293
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,780
She's sitting there with Sebastian 
Thompson,

294
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:51,431
Gora,
Bill Burr,

295
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:53,280
whoever the fuck you and you see,
oh hey,

296
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:53,820

297
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,653
Oh Hey.
You know,

298
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,020
so Adam Carolla sitting behind me.
I know,

299
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,740
I know Adam,
you know,

300
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,573
say hey,
he sits behind me and he doesn't know 

301
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:06,210
there's another comedian behind me and I
meet him and Adam didn't know him.

302
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,450
So Adam Corolla is sitting next to this 
other comedian.

303
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,400
This is the two seats and I'm in front 
of them and the flight tomorrow from Las

304
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,220
Vegas,
six hours.

305
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,250
Okay.
And Adam Carolla,

306
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,130

I'm telling you,

307
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:25,131
did not stop talking to that kid for 
longer than no exaggeration,

308
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,650
30 seconds.
Now you are watching this with like more

309
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:33,840
of a curiosity.
In the beginning I was like,

310
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,853
and I know Adam and I love Adam and he's
great at those pockets all the time and 

311
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,050
he's fucking hilarious.
And I was like,

312
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,030
what is this guy going to fucking take a
break?

313
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,890
Dude,
he,

314
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,130
he didn't,
he didn't take a break.

315
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,340
He didn't take away.
The other kid didn't talk.

316
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,550
It was just like,
yeah,

317
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,430
yeah,
the whole thing.

318
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,270
And that first hour I was like,
man,

319
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,410
he's been talking for an hour and a half
ago.

320
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,630
And I was like,
I'm gonna,

321
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,470
I'm gonna stay listening because I have 
to.

322
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,330
I have to find out when he takes a 
break.

323
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,183
Right.
I have to like see how long and he 

324
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:07,774
didn't do land,
he landed and I was like this 

325
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,830
motherfucker.
And was he talking to off the plane?

326
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,220
It kept going and he never stopped.
He never stopped the kid,

327
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:16,170
the new kid who,
who,

328
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,130
who was on the road,
I don't even know who that was.

329
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,770
Did you catch a glance in his eyes?
No.

330
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,990
No,
not while it was going on.

331
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:23,830
I mean maybe,
maybe I did.

332
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:25,390
I don't,
was anything interesting?

333
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:25,790
Yeah,
no,

334
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,370
every,
it was all interesting.

335
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,780
Adam Corolla is so good at that and he 
was talking about stuff and I was like,

336
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:32,614
man,
this guys,

337
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,910
it's like he had thought about 
everything already that ever happened.

338
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,110
And he's like,
if you say,

339
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,121
if the guy's like,
yeah,

340
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:39,911
cute tips.
It's like,

341
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:40,301
well,
you know,

342
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:44,440
thinking about,
the guy's just amazing at it.

343
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:47,230
So,
so when you're in that comfortable space

344
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,093
where you can just say it like Corolla 
didn't even need that kid to be sitting 

345
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:51,604
there.
And it was interesting if you just 

346
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,880
talked for six hours,
I could be like,

347
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:55,960
all right,
I would listen to this.

348
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,450
He's a conduit of comedy.
It's always challenge them.

349
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,540
So you know,
and I'm not saying I'm as good as that,

350
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,110
but I,
I,

351
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,943
you know,
to get into that comfortable space to 

352
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:08,070
where you can just talk,
which is what we do as comedians.

353
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:08,904
So I feel like it was a version of that 
and I just had to work through a few 

354
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,024
episodes and then I kind of,
I think figured it out after like the 

355
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:15,910
third episode,
I was like,

356
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,773
oh I can do,
I really expected to do about three or 

357
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,080
four episodes and then just chalk it up 
as a,

358
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:20,740
as a loss.

359
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,490
But well guys,
check it out like 74 now.

360
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,260
So we'll keep going.
God bless.

361
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,700
I'm gonna listen.
So I want,

362
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,980
I know you've probably talked about this
so many times,

363
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:34,360
but we've talked about on the podcast 
and Logan Paul hit me with that Echo.

364
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,610
Logan Paul.
All right.

365
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,690
We Ms.
Logan.

366
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,070
Paul got it.
Let me see.

367
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,600
We got that.
He's,

368
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:42,900
he's something we've talked about a lot.
Oh yeah,

369
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:43,241
yeah,
yeah.

370
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,600
I saw you got to sell and what you 
talked about it and it's like,

371
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,320
I feel like that exchange really showed 
what a fucking dumb ass he is.

372
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,320
Or maybe even just like how damaged he 
is from the whole suicide forest.

373
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,570
Yeah.
I want to go over it with,

374
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:01,990
yeah.
Yeah.

375
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,100
If you don't mind,
I'm happy to,

376
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:05,290
yeah.
I want to go over this and I want to get

377
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,360
your thoughts on some of these twitter 
exchanges.

378
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,830
Okay.
Well first of all,

379
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:12,530
I'm curious your initial interaction.
Yeah.

380
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,220
When he said it's important that you 
want,

381
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,210
no,
it's not right now.

382
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:18,490
How did,
how did Logan Paul come on your radar to

383
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:22,270
begin with because you are following,
you are ready.

384
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,230
W did,
I don't know if I was fall.

385
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,290
I may have been following him,
but I think actually I just maybe saw it

386
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,690
because he's so,
you know what I mean?

387
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:33,250
Yeah.
So I probably just responded to it.

388
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,180
Maybe I follow him,
I don't know.

389
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,220
But um,
uh,

390
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,760
so I just write no,
it wasn't because because of the suicide

391
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:46,630
forest and how everywhere that will,
that will,

392
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:47,770
yeah,
that was just bad.

393
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,470
But uh,
and so I just wrote no,

394
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:53,750
it wasn't because like this fucking shot
him dead body in the forest.

395
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,020
This is important.
My,

396
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,521
no,
it wasn't.

397
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,354
So yeah,
it's less I was trolling them and more 

398
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,510
that I was just reacting off of that.

399
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,503
Right.
Yeah.

400
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,563
Um,
and I just thought I didn't think 

401
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,520
anything of it.
I just,

402
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:05,931
yeah,
it's,

403
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,850
and then,
but when he responded,

404
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:08,684
and let me pull this up actually,
because this was like damn dog really 

405
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,320
fucking tried to make this work.
The tsunami of fried laughing analogies.

406
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,503
Oh Shit.
Like what'd you think when you saw that 

407
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,263
wave of yellow and blue?
I was really confused because I thought 

408
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:23,990
it was a fake.
I was like,

409
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:28,991
this is not him.
But then I saw the check,

410
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,490
I was like,
okay.

411
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:36,491
So I guess that is,
and then I thought that's so many,

412
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,510
uh,
emojis so fucking amused.

413
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,600
Yeah.
Like that's laughing for a long time.

414
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,490
Yeah.
That's like,

415
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:47,324
it's not funny anymore.
That's like after the first two rows 

416
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,750
it's getting a little sad.
Yeah,

417
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,320
yeah,
yeah.

418
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,120
After two rows you're like,
oh shit man.

419
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,313
Maybe he's just mentally imbalanced 
because that's why he thought it was 

420
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,330
okay to shoot somebody.

421
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,801
Be like,
all right,

422
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,000
well at least that.
Um,

423
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,650
and then when he said,
and then I read it wrong,

424
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,693
I first read it,
I'm laughing because I know why your 

425
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:12,920
comedy career took a dive and not,
not,

426
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,980
I didn't read.
I'm laughing cause now I know why you're

427
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:19,310
coming here.
So I thought she knew something I didn't

428
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,660
know.
And I was like,

429
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,900
does this guy,
what did I do that I don't know.

430
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:24,980
That's bad.
Right.

431
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,100
That's so much about me.
Like I'm like,

432
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,400
did I just something like my head is 
like,

433
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,680
because it's such a stupid comment,
you almost want to believe that.

434
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:34,580
It's like,
oh my God,

435
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:36,290
does he actually know that there's 
something else,

436
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:36,751
right?
Like,

437
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:37,011
yeah.
Like,

438
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:37,844
yeah.
Like did he see me literally her first 

439
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:42,440
response then?
No,

440
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:43,061
it's not.
What,

441
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:46,580
so not like deserving of anything more 
than just,

442
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,060
yeah.

443
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,150
Or just like at fuck off or whatever the
fuck.

444
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,420
But personally like,
like that response also.

445
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:56,780
What is it in your response that you 
know,

446
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,080
educated him till now,
what,

447
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,923
like why your comedy career took a dive?
Like there wasn't that much information 

448
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:06,470
encoded in your initial response.
Right?

449
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,360
Yeah,
that's true.

450
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,033
Now I know.
Now I know because I wasn't really 

451
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,410
trying to make a joke.
I was just like saying something that's,

452
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,263
I guess like in comedy,
like you'd say what he did was 

453
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:20,790
fundamentally flawed.
Right.

454
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,480
Right.
But another thing that's fundamentally,

455
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:25,550
and I was listening to Bert Kreischer 
talk about this too.

456
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,770
Uh,
and,

457
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,820
and this sounds defensive and this is 
why I have not said this until now in my

458
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:35,840
comedy career has not taken a dive,
right?

459
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,870
Like every year it's been more and more 
clearly a wounded child.

460
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
But what Bert was saying,
and he's right,

461
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,623
there needs to be some kind of truth in 
your burn or roast or whatever you want 

462
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,190
to it.
So

463
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,660
I was like,
oh,

464
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,523
I was like,
oh.

465
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,363
And so I read all that and then I read 
it correctly cause like I'm laughing 

466
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,910
cause I knew why I now I know why you're
coming to her.

467
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,561
It's like,
oh yeah,

468
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,420
he's trying to act like I was trying to 
make a joke and whatever.

469
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:01,780
Yeah.
So then I kind of,

470
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,930
I honestly went right to feeling badly,
right?

471
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,793
Because I was like,
oh well you kind of realize you're 

472
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,440
dealing with the child really well,
he's 24 though.

473
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:14,274
Right?
But intellectually like how can you 

474
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:18,900
write that and not have the intellect of
a much younger person?

475
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,500
That's true.
But even further than that,

476
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,800
here's,
here's the thing,

477
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:30,801
like if you're going to write to 
somebody who I write to people,

478
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,270
oh dude,
this is fun for me.

479
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,213
Right?
I like to fucking clap back and shit 

480
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:37,200
like that to me.

481
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,550
I'm bored.
And people are like,

482
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,530
what do you take it personally?
I don't,

483
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,720
it's just fun.
I like doing it.

484
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,243
My whole thing is if you say something 
to me and you got your 14 followers and 

485
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,540
you think nobody's gonna see it,
dude,

486
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,374
I can't wait.
I want to imagine the look on your face 

487
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,030
when I read the heat.
Load it up,

488
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,810
dude.
You,

489
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,500
this is your game play.
I love that philosophy.

490
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,334
So fun.
People don't appreciate the shit that 

491
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:03,660
you get when you're online.
Like,

492
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,620
oh Jesus Christ.
And I love the thought when you do that,

493
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:08,710
then again,
I'm mad at you.

494
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,410
Like you should have known better than 
to put them on blast.

495
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

496
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:14,991
And it's like,
dude,

497
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:16,530
but this is like,
oh,

498
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,320
oh hey,
this is the internet.

499
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,190
Welcome to the fucking Internet.
When you sign up for twitter,

500
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:24,024
isn't that what,
what you dream happen that somebody who 

501
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
gives you attention,
like that's why you're here.

502
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:30,180
It is.
You would just browse twitter.

503
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:31,350
You don't even need an account.
Yeah,

504
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,480
exactly.
So,

505
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,340
so then I kind of felt bad cause I was 
like,

506
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,174
damn,
I'm going to,

507
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,110
I knew exactly what to say.
I was like,

508
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,510
Oh,
I'm going to say what I said.

509
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:43,231
Right.
It's cozy.

510
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,060
He basically say yo for a coat.
And I was like,

511
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,050
oh,
maybe I should,

512
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,290
maybe I should leave it alone.
But I,

513
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,170
I can't leave it alone because he kind 
of took it to the next level.

514
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,210
Maybe if there was one row of class.

515
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,050
But then I was like,
all right,

516
00:19:58,051 --> 00:19:59,160
fuck it.
I'm just going to do it.

517
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,840
I did it.
And I was like,

518
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,580
that's what you write.
Well here,

519
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:06,570
let's have a look.
At least in my career dies.

520
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:09,810
You can film it and put it on Youtube.
I love that.

521
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:11,470
When you quote tweet him,
you can't even see.

522
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,260
I actually thought maybe that's why he 
did that.

523
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,490
I don't think.
No,

524
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,370
I don't think so either.
No Way.

525
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,540
You wouldn't see the response or tweeted
how fucking great.

526
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,290
Um,
that was such a slam dunk.

527
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,820
Yeah.
I mean,

528
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,810
and look at the likes and likes on that 
one.

529
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,260
It's like everyone,
not everyone just started.

530
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,440
All right.
So he should have been like,

531
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,020
you know,
well played.

532
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,810
I'm going to go on a shoot day,
but now he should have known.

533
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:41,520
I was going to say something like that.

534
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,080
But,
but here's the other thing too,

535
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,593
like if you're,
you're doing to somebody who's going to 

536
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:52,060
write back to you who does this for a 
living.

537
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,050
Yeah.
Like,

538
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,130
it's not,
it's not,

539
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:55,900
you're not doing it to Jerry Seinfeld.
There's going to be like,

540
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:56,740
who's that kid?
Oh,

541
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,900
pairs to do this.
I'm just going to come right back to you

542
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,670
and,
and this is what I do.

543
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:04,900
So like,
anyway,

544
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,550
I did that.
Let's see what's next?

545
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,310
And then he just kept going.
Not going to lie.

546
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,680
This single tweet is funnier than your 
entire Netflix special,

547
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:13,510
which actually it has a lot of looking 
back,

548
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:14,344
right?
Yeah.

549
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,423
Yes.
And that was the last is at least 

550
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,300
tactically breaking this down.
If I were a Dork,

551
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,540
technically this is it.
This is,

552
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,270
uh,
this is,

553
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,190
uh,
you know,

554
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,180
it makes sense.
It's falling compared to that.

555
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,133
But he,
he admits he saw my entire Netflix 

556
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,850
special.
He must not have hated it at that.

557
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,090
And in a way,
in a way,

558
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:39,130
it's really a sincere compliment because
he's like,

559
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,210
go your Netflix special enough to watch 
the whole thing and this tweet was he?

560
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

561
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,580
I love everything you do.
Especially they came out 10 months ago.

562
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:50,650
That was great,
but now you're even,

563
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,930
you've topped yourself.
So I'm a huge fan.

564
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,210
I almost let it go because I was like,
because of that,

565
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:02,044
because I was like,
all right,

566
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,350
I'm a compliment,
but you can't.

567
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,880
I couldn't cause I thought of this and I
was like,

568
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,003
thanks.
How does it feel to have your name 

569
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:11,890
finally attached to something you don't 
understand?

570
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,190
Oh good.
Oh Man.

571
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,960
And I'm on my phone like,
Oh God,

572
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,833
this is fucking hilarious.
I can't wait and I'm having fun because 

573
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,970
come on,
come on.

574
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,450
Eh.
And then so this is something that logan

575
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:28,630
and his peers do a lot.
They do the whole thing of like,

576
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:30,310
oh,
the 38 year old,

577
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,370
it's like dog,
I don't get that.

578
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,751
Oh,
well,

579
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,190
first of all,
I'm 38 I'm not,

580
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm not 60 yeah,
but,

581
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,710
but that aside,
I don't understand the whole,

582
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,603
your old,
you don't get it thing because everyone 

583
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:47,380
gets to be old.
I,

584
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:51,550
that's my favorite image is that logan 
is not that young.

585
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,000
At the same time,
you've got to hit in behind.

586
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:57,880
This guy's like,
I'm just a kid for so long.

587
00:22:57,881 --> 00:22:58,140
Yeah,
yeah,

588
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,973
yeah.
It's like doc,

589
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,450
I'm 38.
Yeah,

590
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,640
it was a kid.
But the thing is I love to imagine Logan

591
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,660
Paul at 38 and he is going to be 
completely without hair.

592
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,730
He is going to,
it's going to be a beautiful thing.

593
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:12,910
I want to check in when he's 38 then 
it'd be like talk,

594
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:15,350
you can't talk to anybody anymore cause 
you're a 38 year old man.

595
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:16,061
Yeah.
Remember what you said.

596
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:20,470
The thing I know I have it on my 
calendar like 12 years.

597
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,030
I don't know that,
that's not a very good argument.

598
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:25,883
Uh,
cause who fucking cares but also by its 

599
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:33,214
merit,
there's nothing really insulting about 

600
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:38,080
it.
It just shows how immature he is.

601
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,870
It's like you're 38 I should,
I don't,

602
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:40,870
I don't,
what do I care about?

603
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,703
Anything you think also imagine,
imagine referring to yourself as is 

604
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:52,640
shunned it really kind of a rock bottom 
thing.

605
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,433
Like,
like that's how he sees himself is kind 

606
00:23:56,871 --> 00:24:00,260
of almost like a,
oh imagine being like,

607
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:01,220
yeah,
cause you know,

608
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:02,270
cause like I'm a,
I'm a shank.

609
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,520
That's like you're who I want to be a 
team.

610
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,503
Hey who are we fighting against?
Because we're both on the same team 

611
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:16,830
here.
Your we're,

612
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,650
we're both fighting you.
Yeah.

613
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,653
It's like you can see the meeting with 
the Spiderman in the spiderman where 

614
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:23,744
they're looking at each other.
That's what the fuck he's doing right 

615
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:26,630
now.
Well,

616
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,220
it's funny you didn't say shun flogger 
introduced.

617
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,950
That also is like blaming you for our 
hearing with him over at twitter when he

618
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:36,950
was the one to make it into this whole 
thing.

619
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,140
Has this been broken down?
This many layers?

620
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,470
I haven't done it yet.

621
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,320
So funny that he used like an like,
I dunno,

622
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,710
I dunno what's worse.
He's just shit.

623
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:52,610
A Schengen blog or being the 38 oldest 
fuck.

624
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:57,611
You're like basically over Canadian 
arguing with and the insinuation,

625
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,503
the,
the crux of this is that anybody who 

626
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,010
interacts with the shun vlogger.
Yeah,

627
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,950
no,
he's like,

628
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:12,070
you're arguing with the shunt blogger 
over twitter who are on twitter.

629
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,210
Yeah.
Who does that?

630
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,910
He's so self deprivation that prep 
Kayden in the worst way.

631
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,643
Let's keep going.
Right?

632
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:22,883
Yeah.
Ask Your fans to have their moms read 

633
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,350
out loud to them.
See what they think.

634
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,400
I didn't want to make fun of how 
youngest fans were,

635
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:34,800
but I felt like that because they 
brought up the age too.

636
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:37,210
It was coming of age.
It really,

637
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,721
and I bought it.
I was like,

638
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:40,250
this is a good enough to me.
I was like,

639
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:44,090
this is funny enough to bring that up.
I just didn't want to be like stupid.

640
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,830
You know?
They're just young.

641
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,811
No.
And,

642
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:47,644
and the truth is,
if you ever do look up like fan meetup 

643
00:25:49,641 --> 00:25:51,230
photos,
like yeah,

644
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,750
it's pretty shocking.
Yeah.

645
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,500
Can you guys look a pregnant lady?
You'd be like,

646
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:55,070
Oh,
you're a fan.

647
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:00,070
No,
my baby and definitely button.

648
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,650
Then it doesn't stop.
No,

649
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,920
but here's the thing.
He,

650
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,230
I think,
and this may not be right,

651
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,150
but I think he wanted to have the last 
word,

652
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:11,984
but he didn't want me to see it.
So then I was even old people roasting 

653
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:17,924
me.

654
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,910
So I was like,
I think I actually responded to this.

655
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,200
I'm not sure.
Well I'm,

656
00:26:21,201 --> 00:26:22,034
I'm not sure what the,
the significance of the greater than 

657
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:26,290
symbol is in this situation.
You know,

658
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,463
old people greater than greatest thing 
on planet earth and I don't understand 

659
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:32,070
the significance a,
I'll try that.

660
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,560
Well,
at any rate,

661
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,490
I love that.
He,

662
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,420
that's such a good observation.
That's definitely what happened.

663
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,353
Yeah,
I think so.

664
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,800
Yeah.
And you know,

665
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:44,760
he had like his whole think tank.
Well cause he rolls with a possum.

666
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,330
Hello Gang.
Like to think that um,

667
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,910
but when they were all side the suicide 
forest,

668
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,040
but they only come up with those insults
because my friend,

669
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,750
they're all the best gang.
Yeah.

670
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,813
Yeah.
I had other ones too that were so 

671
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:02,610
brutal,
but I just,

672
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:03,600
do you remember any?
No,

673
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:04,341
I don't.
I,

674
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:05,250
I took a,
I was,

675
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,580
I had brutal one.

676
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,370
I was going to go,
like,

677
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,430
I didn't bring anybody else but him into
it.

678
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:12,480
I was going,
I could have,

679
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,680
you know what I mean?
But I was just like,

680
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:14,460
Nah,
I can't do that.

681
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,570
Well,
you did it tastefully.

682
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,280
How about this?
You're my son.

683
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,130
Tag Your fucking Daddy.
I'm your fucking dad.

684
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,990
This this way.
I was like,

685
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,090
at least I'm now I'm getting silly or 
I'm like,

686
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:24,930
all right.
You know what I mean?

687
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,230
Like I just want to do it in my head.
Like maybe this kid,

688
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,430
I don't know him.
Maybe he's,

689
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,930
maybe he's literally like,
Oh man,

690
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:32,930
I'm having fun.
Making fun of the comedian.

691
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,540
No,
no,

692
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,240
no,
no.

693
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,073
I don't know.
In a way it's almost like the suicide 

694
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:39,060
forest all over again.
But you're the one filming the dead body

695
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,910
and it does it continue?
Oh yeah.

696
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,440
Logan go,
oh I forgot about this whole exchange is

697
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:51,330
really,
really similar to your life.

698
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,600
As time passes,
your jokes get less and less funny.

699
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,850
Sorry Dad.
Yeah,

700
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,310
that's that one actually.
And the likes are,

701
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,233
are,
are getting,

702
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,463
but also as time passes,
jokes do get less and less funny cause 

703
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:07,580
because you just by the nature of it,
as,

704
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,730
as time passes,
memories become less depressed.

705
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,660
As you get older,
you're 38 to,

706
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,200
you don't remember anything probably.
Uh,

707
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,640
and I don't know.
I think there might have been in it that

708
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,100
are just so legendary.
Yeah.

709
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:21,870
This is one of the best things.
Let me tell you something,

710
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:22,860
man.
Thanks.

711
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,390
But I,
first of all,

712
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,441
first of all,
thank you.

713
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:27,210
Second of all,
I walked around,

714
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,103
I walked around and people were like,
it was like I did the fucking tonight 

715
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:36,210
show in 1987.
People were like that.

716
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:44,410
It speaks to how much and how much they,
how much they cared about that thing you

717
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:47,580
did in the suicide for us.
Like I get,

718
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,400
I listen.
You know,

719
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,310
I get that.
What I said was,

720
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,930
you know,
somewhat funny,

721
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:58,500
but that,
that isn't why it got so many retweets.

722
00:28:58,501 --> 00:28:59,334
It got so many retweets because they 
felt emotional about the stuff that he 

723
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:03,390
did.
Cause it was a beautiful,

724
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:04,224
perfect storm.
Sadly for new media is usually and 

725
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,633
mainstream media only when something 
awful happens and Logan that suicide 

726
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,510
force and was just so fucking,
yeah,

727
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,003
I mean this was a beautiful,
this was just a perfect battle between 

728
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:19,584
good and evil.
It played out on twitter and this new 

729
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:22,104
age and I,
and something occurred to me as I read 

730
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:26,190
the his fine,
I'll tweet them and did this whole,

731
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:29,160
uh,
this whole suicide forest part too.

732
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,230
This was the one,
this was the brain trust final act.

733
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,140
This was what they all thought about and
we're like,

734
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:39,150
that's the one.
Oh right Chris,

735
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:41,110
this whole exchange really something 
cause he's had a set,

736
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,940
he dramatically,
you know,

737
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,270
space it out.
This was,

738
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,590
this,
was it this,

739
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:50,440
this was their joke.
This was the coup de Gras.

740
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,620
Well,
did they get,

741
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:54,350
yeah,
sorry.

742
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,500
Yeah,
I forgot about it.

743
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,510
Hey,
the jokes.

744
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,220
You're just all right.
We are going to take a short break.

745
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,850
We'll be right back with the great and 
hilarious Chris Delea.

746
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,050
If you go anywhere,
well I guess that's your prerogative,

747
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:13,330
but I urge you to stay.
See you soon.

748
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:16,923
Thank you.
To Express Vpn for sponsoring this 

749
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:19,571
episode.
Guys,

750
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:22,300
if you are not using a vpn and this day 
and age,

751
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,760
you're literally insane.
You've got facebook,

752
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,380
you've got twitter,
you've got Google,

753
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:29,170
you've got all these tech giants peaking
up your skirt,

754
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,550
skirt.
You've,

755
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,040
yes,
they're seeing the goods and they're not

756
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,530
paying for it.
You've got the,

757
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,920
you've got your own ISP,
right?

758
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:44,260
They know everything you're doing.
The VPN hide your activity and keeps you

759
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:45,094
anonymous and let's be frank,
the weird shit that you're doing on the 

760
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:49,870
internet,
if that ever came out,

761
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,953
your life would be ruined and it just 
takes one rogue guy with a vpn to be 

762
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:54,880
like,
oh,

763
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:58,030
look what Ethan's been up to when it be 
shipped through.

764
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,073
Exactly.
I don't want you to know and I don't 

765
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:04,540
ever want you to know,
and that's the power of the vpn at Max.

766
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,403
All your activity.
It could you anonymous as the Internet 

767
00:31:07,271 --> 00:31:08,104
should be,
that keeps you safe and it keeps all 

768
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,700
these other boys from picking up your 
skirt without buying you dinner,

769
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,763
pound it.

770
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,323
Here's another thing.
If you're in a public space and you're 

771
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:19,594
not using a vpn,
you are literally getting hacked by 

772
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:23,680
everybody there.
You go into a starbucks,

773
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,514
there's 50 people there,
you know there's at least one guy 

774
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,303
stealing people's credit card 
information and bank statements and all 

775
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:32,560
of your private information.
Without a VPN,

776
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,000
you are subject to people literally 
stealing your data and public spaces.

777
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,520
If you're not using a vpn and today's 
age,

778
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,970
you are literally nuts.
The best one is expressed vpn.

779
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,940
It's fast.
It's the world's leader in security.

780
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,480
They keep your activity private and 
anonymous.

781
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,180
They are great for streaming with their 
blazing,

782
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,170
blazing fast speeds and it costs less 
than seven bucks a month.

783
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,243
Give me a fricking break.
I'd say that's a great price to pay for 

784
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:04,360
a little on amenity.
That's what the Internet is all about,

785
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,400
so every time you use it in and out 
without express Vpn,

786
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:10,234
you are putting sensitive data at risk.

This is so important,

792
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:39,181
you guys don't let it get out about the 
Hentai you've been watching.

793
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,310
Thank you,
honey.

794
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,830
If you are not using honey,
then you are literally burning money,

795
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,740
right Ila.
It's true.

796
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,630
Honey is as good as it sounds,
sweet as honey.

797
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,540
It's the honeypot.
Folks.

798
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,380
Just put your hand in and get some of 
that sweet honey.

799
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,363
Honey is an app you went to solid.
It's two clicks on the browser you're 

800
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,270
using.
You shopped the web like you usually do.

801
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,630
What this does is it checks for coupons 
you ever,

802
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:15,763
you ever,
you have neurotic like we are and you 

803
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:18,224
just,
you're like,

804
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,310
oh,
I'm buying shoes.

805
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,263
Let me just see if this store has 
coupons on there because sometimes you 

806
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:26,510
find the qb gets 50% off.
Honey does that for you while you shop.

807
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,540
Not only do they save you money,
they save you life.

808
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,730
If you're like me because I'm neurotic 
to the point,

809
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:33,680
I'll spend 30 minutes looking for a 
coupon.

810
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,640
You know what I mean?
And then I'll go,

811
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,493
it's like,
man,

812
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,100
I saved 20 bucks and I spent 30 minutes 
on my life.

813
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:40,934
I'm not sure it was worth it.
Honey saves you both automatically with 

814
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:46,400
two fricking clicks.
Look here,

815
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,670
I was shopping for shoes.
Swear to God.

816
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,143
Got a couple pairs.
Honey pops in at the checkout and it's 

817
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:55,460
like,
I found coupons.

818
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,290
Click here to apply it.
Boom,

819
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,430
look at this $53 save without even 
thinking about it.

820
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,120
I was skeptical at first of honey.
I was like,

821
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,320
oh,
what's the deal with this?

822
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,460
It fricking works and I love it and I 
wouldn't browse without it anymore.

823
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,713
Also does shit like on Amazon,
it compares previous prices and sellers 

824
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,650
like the best price.
Yeah.

825
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:20,750
It tells you if this is like the best 
price it's ever been.

826
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:21,763
If you should stick around,
if you should hold it or if you should 

827
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:25,880
slam,
and that's the honeypot.

828
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,250
Folks.
When hunter has got your back,

829
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,450
you will never overpay for anything on 
Amazon ever again.

830
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,493
They're going to save you money.
You're going to be praising to the Lord 

831
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:36,530
Jesus.
Honey,

832
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,460
how could I ever done it without you?
It's two clicks.

833
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,310
It's free.
There's no reason not to add,

834
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:45,230
honey.
Get the sweetness.

835
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,230
Get it in your mouth.
You're going to get the honey.

836
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,390
You're going to be like,
oh my God,

837
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,490

It's a little wild,

838
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,310
but it tastes so f and good and it's 
free.

839
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,773

bear.
Pretty cut that part down.

845
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,920
We are back with Chris Delea.
What's the fucking thing

846
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,400
with Lacroix?
I right?

847
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:25,920
Yeah,
I,

848
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,000
yeah,
and I know,

849
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,450
I know the day that I learned about 
Lacroix and I,

850
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,020
and it's weird that I'm telling you this
now because you brought this up,

851
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,123
he,
so you guys brought up that you didn't 

852
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:38,070
know that you didn't realize

853
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,083
I was on an episode of workaholics and 
before I kind of had telfer a fan that 

854
00:35:44,001 --> 00:35:44,834
go right.
Yeah.

855
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,980
Great workaholics episode ever sing the 
praises.

856
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:52,350
It was our favorite episode and out APP.
Wow.

857
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,800
Thanks.
That's so it's,

858
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:54,390
and that,
that's,

859
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,460
that's the long thanks.
Anyway,

860
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,280
at any rate,
it was the first season of the,

861
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:04,610
of the show and uh,
while I was shooting that as tofor,

862
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,300
that was when I learned,
uh,

863
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,850
when you had your first check was like,
man,

864
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:11,190
Lacroix is fucking awesome boy.
Shit.

865
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,140
Yeah,
yeah,

866
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,920
yeah.
I was like,

867
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,753
what is it?
Shit.

868
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,720
And I was like,
just fucking soda is really good.

869
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:21,930
It is better than,
here's what I,

870
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,690
here's my thing about Lacroix.
They,

871
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,460
and this is not an ad.
No,

872
00:36:26,461 --> 00:36:28,690
this is not an addict,
but everybody fucking knows what Lacroix

873
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:30,210
is.
It's like Google.

874
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:32,790
It's just like,
it's the Google of nodal advertising,

875
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,680
but everyone knows,
hey fuck it is,

876
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,350
why is it that people act as if Lacroix 
invented soda water?

877
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,280
You could buy soda water.
Yes.

878
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:43,770
That little flavor.
Always.

879
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,660
Always.
When I was,

880
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,303
when I came out of everything that they 
offered you a sip of Cherry flavored 

881
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:52,471
soda.
Whoa.

882
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:53,830
What it is.
Cause it's,

883
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,090
what is it like French and it's got a 
French name,

884
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:59,100
but I heard that Americans are like,
Ooh,

885
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,440
I'm a Dan.
Tom Tell us that.

886
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:05,070
It's not just saying it's a girl like 
the crew or some bullshit.

887
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,933
I don't know.
And he was getting upset because it was 

888
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:10,290
like,
you guys are the guys who we named it.

889
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,280
He was saying they want it to be called 
like Lacroix,

890
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,120
like the French way.
But he's like,

891
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:16,620
but you guys are not French.
So it's like,

892
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,740
oh fuck is a this,
I don't know.

893
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:20,521
Yeah.
It surprised me.

894
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:21,354
I was like,
Oh shit,

895
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,650
you just to speak French.
He's like,

896
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:24,360
no,
but I'm,

897
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:25,260
I know all about drinks.

898
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,940
I think what they did is like,
it's an American brand.

899
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,790
Kids were not drinking soda.
Water was the beverage of,

900
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,190
of all of your dad.
I always hated it.

901
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah,
me too.

902
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,833
Me Too.
And I think it was a perfect timing of 

903
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:39,294
people being like,
maybe I don't want to drink 50 grams of 

904
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:41,874
sugar,
but I want something more exciting than 

905
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:45,440
water from the garbers.
Yeah.

906
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,450
Yeah.
Before I was born,

907
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,200
this can't believe this isn't an ad,
but especially,

908
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,360
well,
let me just say to you,

909
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:55,080
pull this out.
It's fucking soda water.

910
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,890
You can buy a 99 cent Ralph Brute 
Brands,

911
00:37:57,891 --> 00:38:00,080
soda water through the same shit.
Not the same.

912
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,230
But here's the thing.
I don't,

913
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,380
I drink sparkling water.
Um,

914
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,830
I don't like it as bright as,
um,

915
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,850
I don't like it as much as club soda.
I like clubs,

916
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:15,630
sort of better soda.
Oh,

917
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,100
I didn't know there was a distinction.
I'm holding it like this.

918
00:38:19,101 --> 00:38:19,680
Like,
okay,

919
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,060
they need to pay me now I'm going to put
it down.

920
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,850
Club soda has,
has larger bubble.

921
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,940
It feels like it.
Like,

922
00:38:24,941 --> 00:38:26,220
like whenever,
like I'm in a restaurant,

923
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,150
I'm like,
Can I get club soda?

924
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:28,040
And they're like,
you want Pellegrino?

925
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:28,531
I'm like,
no.

926
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:30,300
Do you have it from the gun that I 
fucking better.

927
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,470
Yeah,
exactly.

928
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,850
So did I fucking stutter?

929
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,851
I've heard,
you know,

930
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:39,340
I've,
I've hung out with friends who are like,

931
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,410
Ooh,
I know the difference between,

932
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,423
yeah,
I prefer Pellegrino because it has 

933
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:45,460
tighter bubbles.
Oh yeah,

934
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,090
it does.
Huh?

935
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,010
For the carbonation is less intense.
Yes.

936
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,580
Is that the difference?
It's like fine.

937
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:53,170
And the club is like,
if you chug it,

938
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:55,920
you'll fuck your throat up thing.
That's why I love that shit.

939
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,460
A little burn.
I love it.

940
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,140
Nice.
Because when I got,

941
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,150
when I cut out soda,
I was like 31 and my mom,

942
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,560
I did,
uh,

943
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,393
I was actually doing some kind of a joke
with my family and I lifted my shirt up 

944
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:12,160
as it afforded the joke and my mom was 
like,

945
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:13,120
you gained some weight?
And I was like,

946
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:13,954
no.
I thought I had been one 75 my whole 

947
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:17,050
life.
And uh,

948
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,970
once 75.
Yeah,

949
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,150
you're tall guy.
That's pretty well,

950
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,110
but this was when I was 31.

951
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,280
And so I was like,
no.

952
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:22,180
She's like,
I have a scale up there.

953
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:24,550
Why don't you weigh yourself.
And I was one 95 and I almost passed out

954
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:25,390
and I was like,
Oh my God,

955
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:27,760
I'm 20 pounds heavier.
I didn't check but this long.

956
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,440
And uh,
but I'm tall.

957
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:32,130
So like it had been down,
you know,

958
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,870
and uh,
and I stopped drinking soda.

959
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,330
I started drinking diet at first.
I,

960
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,790
and I fucking hate diet soda.
All of you get used to it.

961
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,090
I like it now.
I never got used to tell him.

962
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:43,790
I was like,
dude,

963
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,580
this is,
I,

964
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,490
it's,
it tastes horrible to be,

965
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,250
at first it tastes like,
you know,

966
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:51,010
poison really.
[inaudible] it is.

967
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:54,490
Yeah.
When I'm presented with the choice of do

968
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:55,324
I want the original or do I want the,
basically it's do I want to be fat or 

969
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:01,510
don't want to die of cancer or diabetes 
or cancer.

970
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,270
It's literally the what you're choosing.
And so,

971
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,080
so I,
I,

972
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,330
he's great.
I was like,

973
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,330
diabetes never tasted so good.
I was like,

974
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,743
at least I'll look good.
Hold life even though it will be 

975
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:16,330
shorter.
And,

976
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,090
and that is basically,
if I'm ever run for mayor,

977
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:20,710
that's what I'm going to use as my 
platform.

978
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,020
Do you know what I mean?
Like live a shorter life,

979
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:23,883
but look good the whole time.
And as Mary you're plugging in diet 

980
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,560
beverages if they pay me.
And so,

981
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,840
um,
so I,

982
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,450
I,
I stopped drinking diets.

983
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:36,850
I was like a fuck this diet.
This sucks too.

984
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:37,900
Right?
And so,

985
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:40,240
and then I would watch like the 
documentary is about how I was like,

986
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:41,074
you're dying.
You take your diet and selfish because 

987
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,130
your family will cry.
And uh,

988
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,490
and so I started,
I was like,

989
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:52,324
fuck this.
And I started drinking just water and I 

990
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,640
was like,
I can't just drink.

991
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,473
Fuck.
What am I [inaudible] here we're human 

992
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:00,460
beings.
We crave.

993
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,770
Yeah.
This is why we're on this earth.

994
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,230
We invented things better than water.
Come on,

995
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,850
dude.
That's like saying I'm not gonna live in

996
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:08,620
a house.
I'm just going to go camping.

997
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,543
I'm going to live in a fucking cave.
That's all I had to get the fuck outta 

998
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,221
here.
We made walls,

999
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:13,390
we've got toasters,
the microwaves.

1000
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:16,090
Let's do all of those motherfuckers.
So now,

1001
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,700
so now I'm like,
all right,

1002
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:21,370
I'm not going to just drink water.
And then I was like,

1003
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,980
let's see what this fucking lacroixs up.
Right.

1004
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,520
See what's up.
And I did it and it was the PR.

1005
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,860
I waited enough time to where I didn't 
have the soda and I was like,

1006
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,270
oh,
this has the bubbles.

1007
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,100
But also it's not just water,
little flavor,

1008
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,590
a little flavor if you want that flavor 
to,

1009
00:41:35,591 --> 00:41:36,770
by the way,
what?

1010
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,710
What's the flavor that I drink?
Where does it come from?

1011
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:41,570
I don't know.
Is that Sweden?

1012
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,590
Yeah.
I don't know what I mean.

1013
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:44,360
But I also drink the regular blue 
lacroix.

1014
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,373
I'll just drink regular soda water.
Just straight up the water that's safe 

1015
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,940
because we know what the bubble,
but like feel like taste.

1016
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,160
They're like,
eh.

1017
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,670
I mean,
think about how,

1018
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,780
this is kind of weird,
right?

1019
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:57,630
They're like,
here's a mango flavored soda water.

1020
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,140
Yeah,
there's just no mango.

1021
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:03,430
And you look at the fucking things in 
zero.

1022
00:42:03,431 --> 00:42:06,380
Oh Romaine will.
But if you eat a mango,

1023
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:11,381
it's not zero across silos where they'll
know it's bullshit.

1024
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,603
I'm just saying maybe just,
I'm glad this isn't an ad cause you're 

1025
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,700
bullshit for doing there.
I was from Wisconsin.

1026
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,190
From Wisconsin.
Yeah.

1027
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,690
You can't trust people from Wisconsin.
Little Croydon.

1028
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:25,850
The may well be getting millions people 
cancer.

1029
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,500
True.
We wouldn't know now.

1030
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,690
It just came up 10 fucking years lying 
down in 10 years.

1031
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:30,261
It'll be like,
yeah.

1032
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:33,350
It turns out that Luke Roy is the new 
smoking in,

1033
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:34,270
in,
in,

1034
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,293
in 30 years.
I'm going to be like on a hospital bed 

1035
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,550
just like I shouldn't have drank all 
that look cry.

1036
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,120
I should've stuck with Ivan coke cans.
Sugar was organic.

1037
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:47,750
Damn it.
We understood what it was.

1038
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,260
At least now that can take the cancer 
out.

1039
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,210
They can take the sugar cancer out.
That can't take the Lacrosse.

1040
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:58,300
We haven't gotten there.
He's not fast enough.

1041
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,650
Um,
well guys,

1042
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:03,590
if your drink lacroix responsibility and
be aware of that,

1043
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,830
you know,
you could be cost.

1044
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,810
It could cost a new disease that we 
didn't even have yet.

1045
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,490
That's the thing about disease.
It's just going to keep it,

1046
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,350
we're going to figure stuff out and then
not,

1047
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:12,930
not align.

1048
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:13,763
Poppy common.
I'm also going to run for mayor at that 

1049
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,380
path guide.
A killer platform.

1050
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:19,840
Literally.
Yeah.

1051
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:20,743
Literally you're all going to die.
You might as well have me be your 

1052
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,420
maximum.
So on twitter,

1053
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:28,670
well clearly,
you know you got into it with Logan,

1054
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:31,340
but you're very,
you have a good time on twitter.

1055
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:35,030
Let's say you have a trend where you,
if people talk some smack,

1056
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,143
yeah.
You'll retweet them and blast into the 

1057
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:37,904
world.
Yeah.

1058
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:42,710
But I'm curious,
does twitter comments ever like actually

1059
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:44,720
get to you?
Because sometimes you know,

1060
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,400
and my case,
yeah.

1061
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,100
Sometimes you know it's a,
it's a lot.

1062
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:53,210
Yeah.
Like do they ever make me feel bad?

1063
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,110
Like it's about a performance or a stand
up or whatever.

1064
00:43:57,111 --> 00:43:57,861
Like Hey,
I don't,

1065
00:43:57,861 --> 00:43:58,694
I don't,
I didn't like what you did if more than 

1066
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,020
if it's a genuine thing and not just 
like,

1067
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,020
oh,
you know,

1068
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:07,490
you select a piece of shit or whatever.
But if it's like,

1069
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,620
I don't know though.

1070
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,680
I mean,
maybe I can't say it never affects me,

1071
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:16,410
but like,
you know,

1072
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,470
a person,
but like I just,

1073
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,970
I kinda,
the Internet is just like,

1074
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:20,804
you have to adopt the fact that it's 
just Narnia and it doesn't exist or 

1075
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,820
you're going to go fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1076
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,110
You know?
Um,

1077
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,593
and my brother also told me someone,
I was a kid when I was coming up when I 

1078
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:34,590
was growing up and he's younger than me,
but,

1079
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:35,220
uh,
we,

1080
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,750
we were talking about girls and I was 
talking about how I,

1081
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,660
I,
I hated when a girl didn't like me and I

1082
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:43,380
liked her,
like,

1083
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,150
and I was like,
why does that bother me so much?

1084
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:46,130
Not Fair.
Yeah.

1085
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,020
It sucks.
I want,

1086
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,520
I like to rejection,
you know?

1087
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,770
And my brother said,
well,

1088
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,770
what do you think everybody's going to 
like you?

1089
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,170
And I know that so,
so simple.

1090
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,070
But that time,
for some reason it clicked like that,

1091
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,770
that isn't possible.
So I was like,

1092
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,540
Eh,
and it made it a lot easier.

1093
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:09,360
So now I'm telling you that was like a 
switch.

1094
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:11,070
And I know it's so simple and I'm not an
idiot.

1095
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:13,190
I didn't do that already.
Yeah.

1096
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,063
Just like it was like a perfect time.
Perfect way that he said it and it was 

1097
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:17,891
just like,
yeah,

1098
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:18,960
I guess fuck it.
You know,

1099
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,333
plus stand up when you're onstage 
telling 400 people that joke and it 

1100
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:27,090
bombs,
right.

1101
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,120
You tend to learn to not care about.
Is that the worst thing bombing on stage

1102
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:33,294
to this day?
Are you,

1103
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,410
does that happen still when you're 
laying on it?

1104
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:39,520
Once you have any sort of fan base,
it's,

1105
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,710
it becomes tougher to bomb because 
people just going to be a generous,

1106
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,590
more generous and they give you the 
benefit of the doubt.

1107
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,550
I always say this though.
Um,

1108
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,393
you're not truly bombing.
A comedian doesn't truly bomb on unless 

1109
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,760
the comedian feels bad about bombing 
because if you're on stage,

1110
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,080
it's all about the state of mind.
If I'm bombing,

1111
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,630
like if,
if people aren't laughing and I'm like,

1112
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,120
I fucking fuck you guys.
It doesn't matter.

1113
00:46:09,121 --> 00:46:11,400
This is funny.
You don't feel bad for the guy.

1114
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,151
You're like,
oh,

1115
00:46:12,151 --> 00:46:14,130
he's just having an off night.
But if I'm on stage,

1116
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:17,040
I'm bombing and he freaking all African.
I'm just like,

1117
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,201
all right,
well,

1118
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:20,034
uh,
uh,

1119
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,873
anyway,
uh,

1120
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,823
yeah.
Then you're like,

1121
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,730
oh,
this guy.

1122
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,553
Right.
So being on the stage is so much about 

1123
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,100
that confidence,
which I,

1124
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,003
I do,
I don't know if we've talked about this 

1125
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:32,520
on air off air,
but we were talking about it before,

1126
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,560
uh,
maybe 20 minutes ago.

1127
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,633
But yeah.
Um,

1128
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,300
yeah,
it's about,

1129
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,133
it's how you say it is it,
but it's still tough though sometimes 

1130
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:40,014
if,
uh,

1131
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:40,740
if,
uh,

1132
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,530
like if I get heck,
I get heckled a bunch and if,

1133
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,393
if I get heckled and,
and I dig a hole because I'm like 

1134
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:49,290
telling some guy off and then I tried to
get back into it.

1135
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,100
It's tougher and snap back.
It happened the other night actually.

1136
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,020
Um,
what'd he say?

1137
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,423
No,
you know what I get sometimes I hate 

1138
00:46:57,511 --> 00:47:02,511
this Wu's like woo,
like mid Joe.

1139
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,030
Yeah.
Like Woo.

1140
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,980
Like you're not at the fucking mets 
game,

1141
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,930
like laughing,
don't laugh.

1142
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:10,880
But if I'm like,
if I'm like,

1143
00:47:10,881 --> 00:47:13,400
hey,
so I was at verizon and someone's like,

1144
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:16,040
Woo,
like you don't fucking,

1145
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,960
or like I've mentioned the other night,
I was like,

1146
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:18,943
yeah,
I said something about El Paso and 

1147
00:47:20,121 --> 00:47:21,980
somebody was like,
Woo El Paso.

1148
00:47:21,981 --> 00:47:26,480
And I'm like,
I'm not being a guy who does that.

1149
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:31,390
I imagine being a guy who is like,
oh dude,

1150
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:34,960
that guy just said where I'm from.
And then having to be like,

1151
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,030
oh fuck yeah,
that's,

1152
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:40,810
that's,
imagine being a guy who does that.

1153
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,940
And for real lots of guys do that.
That's fucking,

1154
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,200
to me,
that's,

1155
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,333
I'd rather be a guy who like thought my 
own shit was his meal at least then I 

1156
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:57,020
don't fit in and know that around.

1157
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,030
It's like,
oh that guy.

1158
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,450
But to be one of those Douche bag guys,
that's like,

1159
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:03,850
he said,
fucking Austin,

1160
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:06,010
Woo,
you suck.

1161
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,610
And you're also in this society.
I wonder if he thinks he's helping you.

1162
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,900
He's just like they do.
Yeah,

1163
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,570
they 100% though.
Cause then I roast them and then they're

1164
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:14,980
like mid to show better.
Right.

1165
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,430
No Man,
I'm hilarious.

1166
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,264
Thank God I fucking just fixed it so 
everyone's going to be worn at your 

1167
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,880
show,
dude.

1168
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:29,410
I hate,
but it's like,

1169
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:30,600
it's like,
it's like going to the fucking,

1170
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,030
it's like going to Ikea and,
and,

1171
00:48:33,031 --> 00:48:34,090
and,
and uh,

1172
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,633
that,
that guy fucking up the show and be 

1173
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:39,100
fixing it and thinking that he did it is
like,

1174
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:39,934
it's like going to Ikea and walking in 
with the furniture and then breaking it 

1175
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:45,400
and going and then being like,
it broke.

1176
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,870
You're like,
all right,

1177
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:49,240
well you broke it.
You fucked it up.

1178
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,350
I've heard you go on rants like this.
Similar.

1179
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:56,770
I heard you ranting recently about uh,
listening parties.

1180
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,143
Yeah,
dude,

1181
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:02,950
I heard you're going on about what is a 
new thing?

1182
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:04,960
This wasn't a thing like a couple of 
years ago.

1183
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:07,210
All of a sudden,
this is how lost we are,

1184
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:08,350
man.
Dude.

1185
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,480
Okay,
so you made a,

1186
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,530
you made an album.
We can hear it anywhere.

1187
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,200
Do you know that?
You know that?

1188
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,123
Okay,
so why are we a flying to Wyoming if 

1189
00:49:22,571 --> 00:49:25,990
you're not going to be doing it live?
We're just going to be around a fire and

1190
00:49:25,991 --> 00:49:28,420
Kitkat he's going to be there.
Eat My dick.

1191
00:49:28,421 --> 00:49:31,230
There's no fucking way.
There's no fucking,

1192
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,400
what makes you so angry that I'm 
intrigued,

1193
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:34,893
dude,
there's no way cause you weren't 

1194
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:37,384
invited.
Now that somebody said that on twitter 

1195
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:38,861
and I was like,
Bro,

1196
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:39,694
you don't know me.
If Kanye West fucking knock on my door 

1197
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:43,564
and said,
hey man,

1198
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,150
you want to come to my listening party,
I go like this.

1199
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,620
Hey Man,
no,

1200
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,250
I will wait for this fucking spotify 
thing to drop.

1201
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:55,410
What is it that listening to music with 
a bunch of people in a room,

1202
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:58,270
it makes you go so fucking nuts because 
you know why?

1203
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,560
Because,
because,

1204
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:04,740
because here's why.
Because 80 and that's a fucking small.

1205
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,040
It might be more,
80% of the people are just there because

1206
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:12,240
it's a thing that's not because they 
really want to hear them.

1207
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,200
Because if you just really wanted to 
hear the album,

1208
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,060
you'd just hear the fucking album,
right?

1209
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:16,810
Yeah.
Okay.

1210
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,360
You wouldn't cop a flight to Wyoming.
All right,

1211
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,020
so,
so that's really what it is.

1212
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:23,854
And that's w.
W w I have this thing on my podcast 

1213
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:28,280
where I talk about that's what a fucking
Kuta

1214
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,113
is,
man.

1215
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:33,620
And a Kuta is short for Barracuda and 
Barracuda is if,

1216
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,483
if you're wearing jewelry and you and 
you fish and to get a barracuda and you 

1217
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:40,370
pull it Barracuda,
the Barracuda will attack you because it

1218
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,260
sees jewelry and it's just like high 
jewelry.

1219
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,880
Got To have it.
That's what,

1220
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,310
that's what you are.
If you're going to Coachella,

1221
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,480
that's what you're doing.
Cause you're like,

1222
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,230
oh,
it's a thing.

1223
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:53,230
Let's go do what you want.
I have never been to either coachella or

1224
00:50:56,091 --> 00:51:00,230
they're listening so it's just fine.
But last night I felt that,

1225
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,100
oh my God,
no,

1226
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,940
every,
every,

1227
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,650
everybody has a little bit of Kuta in 
them.

1228
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,180
Right?
You got to hear about our last night.

1229
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,233
You need a little,
you need a little little lacroix and 

1230
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:10,490
your life.
You get out,

1231
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:11,960
you need a simple look,
you have to do.

1232
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,370
And I get it and,
and to me,

1233
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:18,200
my life is all about fighting that as 
best I can right now.

1234
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,880
That's a valeant.
That's a valeant work.

1235
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,020
Dude.
I have a code man.

1236
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,570
Do you know,
let me ask you this,

1237
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,760
but what about your,
about your shoes?

1238
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,140
What about my shoes?
They're not the belly.

1239
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,460
Fuck do cheer was I?
No,

1240
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:29,420
I got the,
I was,

1241
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,850
I want to know is,
do you think that's a little,

1242
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,340
because it's the funniest,
well wait,

1243
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,320
those are cognacs.
Yeah.

1244
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,213
Yeah.
So you won't go to his listening party 

1245
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,813
feel where his fucking,
cause if we can go anywhere that ship 

1246
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,410
from right here,
I got them on stock X.

1247
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,150
I love shoes.
I might,

1248
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:48,920
I'm might in it and that way you can 
say,

1249
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,813
but I buy,
I buy the shoes that I really genuinely 

1250
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:53,060
like.
And are those coffee?

1251
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,313
You're very,
yeah.

1252
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,000
Connie white shoes are fucking,

1253
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:56,780

1254
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,780
our intern has fake yeezys on,
he's in deep.

1255
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,253
You've got the whole,
you know the onion night from game of 

1256
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:09,440
thrones.
You Watch that show?

1257
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,633
No,
I watched like three seasons and the 

1258
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,190
smuggler,
he knows all the like back channels.

1259
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,610
Yeah.
He could open a fake easy store.

1260
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,860
That's the guy.
Uh,

1261
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,180
and he should,
the guy who has the brothel,

1262
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,043
no,
not him.

1263
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,140
The onion night.
He's the modeler.

1264
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,230
I Dunno.
Yeah,

1265
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,760
I saw the whole thing.
Anyway.

1266
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:31,400
I saw a guy at the gym the other day 
that had on this was hilarious.

1267
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,383
He had on fake yeezys you could tell.
Well the reason that on the side it 

1268
00:52:38,301 --> 00:52:42,320
literally said Kanye.
I was like,

1269
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:46,160
dude,
special edition or what not even how it,

1270
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:49,490
this is not even what they look like.
You know,

1271
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:52,340
you can go on Amazon cause I was just so
intrigued because,

1272
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,670
well apparently what?
It's hooked up.

1273
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:57,800
I'm sorry,
Ian's probably feeling so bad cause he's

1274
00:52:57,801 --> 00:52:59,150
in so deep,
but I,

1275
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,410
I'm just so intrigued.
Yeah.

1276
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,510
Oh Man.
Poor man dude.

1277
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,373
Why I out of them?
I'm still intrigued because he finds 

1278
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,340
like there's hookups.
Yeah.

1279
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,720
So in China you've got the people that 
make the,

1280
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:14,310
the real yeezys and those same mother 
fuckers,

1281
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,700
what the fuck would a little tiny 
difference.

1282
00:53:18,701 --> 00:53:19,534
So they don't get sued and then they 
sell them to people like on the Silk 

1283
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,450
Road.
Right.

1284
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,040
So there's in betweens and they sell to 
America and they're not

1285
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,020
that cheap.
You get those for like 100 bucks.

1286
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:30,600
Like,
how much can I ask?

1287
00:53:30,601 --> 00:53:31,980
How many of those shoes you're going to 
get?

1288
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,233
Well,
it depends on what the market is like 

1289
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:35,460
what are those run?
Yeah.

1290
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,570
So these,
okay,

1291
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:38,550
so here's the interesting about it sells
out,

1292
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:39,990
right?
And then you're getting my name out.

1293
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:41,250
They were like,
I dunno,

1294
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:45,330
200 or something reasonable.
Sure.

1295
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:49,440
And when they came out,
they shut up and I want it to get them,

1296
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,180
but they were like 700 bucks and I was 
like,

1297
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,043
I'm not the ham.
They went up to a thousand and I was 

1298
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:55,880
like,
I got to get them going.

1299
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,753
So I paid for them.
I paid for him a thousand or a thousand 

1300
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:00,270
dollars.
That's the most,

1301
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:01,200
by the way,
I've ever paid for shoes.

1302
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:05,250
And then the next like month they 
rereleased nother,

1303
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,650
like 400 bucks.
But that's the game though,

1304
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:08,950
man.
I did the same.

1305
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,460
Kind of did the same thing with the 
supreme bag.

1306
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,093
Oh,
you were in a supreme,

1307
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,423
well we feel we have a street clothing 
brand and supreme as much of a meme as 

1308
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:20,220
they are and how ridiculous has gotten,
yeah,

1309
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:22,140
it does make awesome shit.
Yeah.

1310
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,013
No,
that's kind of the shame of it is that 

1311
00:54:23,851 --> 00:54:25,500
it's gotten it.
Same with Gucci.

1312
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:27,720
Like I love Gucci and everything they 
do,

1313
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:30,780
but it's like Logan Paul for example,
is always wearing Gucci.

1314
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,920
If I was new to you,
I would prohibit sale people like him,

1315
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,300
but we can't.
Right?

1316
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:37,870
Like how are you going to stop that?
That's funny.

1317
00:54:37,871 --> 00:54:39,120
I dude,
death threats,

1318
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,000
right.
Investigators of jared,

1319
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:42,834
let them get it,
get this stuff and said now he's got to 

1320
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:48,480
burn the shoes.
I'm sorry.

1321
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:49,314
And I'm going to,
you know what I should buy in a pair of 

1322
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:51,730
you.
How much?

1323
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,583
1,000.

1324
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,420
Some of them you get for like,
they've got the new moon,

1325
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,140
uh,
color yellow.

1326
00:55:00,141 --> 00:55:01,260
What does it fucking,
I dunno.

1327
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,700
They're,
they're cool and they're comfy.

1328
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,600
That's the codeine you,
it depends.

1329
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:08,530
Cause here's the thing,
I will say it.

1330
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,830
Mosaic Kuta did the code,
the code.

1331
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,273
So it is,
it is to just go get the shoes because 

1332
00:55:18,571 --> 00:55:19,404
they're popular.
There is a little bit of that in me 

1333
00:55:22,171 --> 00:55:25,350
because I can,
I know that because when I see a shoe,

1334
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:26,881
I think,
oh,

1335
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:27,714
that's ugly.
But then it grows on me if I see it 

1336
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:32,360
enough and that's for sure.
Kuta um,

1337
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,160
but it is a cool show.
I think so,

1338
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,050
but thanks.
Yeah.

1339
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,000
A lot of people,
a lot of people hate these and now,

1340
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,850
yeah,
it's been a whole thing this year,

1341
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,410
but I like him.
I think it's fun.

1342
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,820
I think it's almost like a parody,
but yeah.

1343
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,670
The Dad shoot yet at what point does 
$1,000

1344
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:52,840
shoe stopped becoming a parody jokes on 
him.

1345
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,970
Whoever buys them,
I guess.

1346
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,810
I mean I just dropped 200 on these,
these oh yeah,

1347
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:58,950
the adidas.
Yeah.

1348
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,813
Yeah.
Those are cool.

1349
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,190
Can you get a close up?
You get a close up Dan.

1350
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,730
Really cool with the shorts and socks.
Thanks.

1351
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,660
Six eggs.
I am somewhat of a fashion icon.

1352
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,460
Um,
psychopath.

1353
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,260
Yeah.
What's going on there?

1354
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:18,420
That's a show you're working on for 
Youtube.

1355
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:22,610
That's,
that's tough to talk about.

1356
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,220
I don't know where.
No problem.

1357
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:26,170
Yeah.
But uh,

1358
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,213
um,
here's something I'm super excited to 

1359
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:31,654
talk about.
I heard you mentioned I was watching 

1360
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:34,390
your hot ones.
Okay.

1361
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,150
And I heard you mentioned Chris Gaines.
Yeah.

1362
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:37,984
And garth brooks is like one of my 
favorite fucking people in the world 

1363
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:47,221
because he's such a goofy guy.
He's like both a superstar and also like

1364
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,840
a cringe Lord.
Yes.

1365
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,130
Um,
well yeah.

1366
00:56:51,131 --> 00:56:52,870
Did you see the fucking when you joined 
facebook?

1367
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,900
That's what I want to watch.
I've had his facebook,

1368
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:00,790
his inaugural facebook video on my 
refrigerator for so long.

1369
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:03,040
I think it's the best fucking video 
ever.

1370
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:06,360
I want to watch me.
I haven't seen a lot.

1371
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:08,350
I,
this video has been on,

1372
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,930
I have like a whole list of like great 
content.

1373
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:14,170
I want to talk about.
That one's been on there for a decade,

1374
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:15,004
that's top notch that,
that when that came out and I watched 

1375
00:57:17,891 --> 00:57:22,891
that my top lip didn't touch my bottom 
lip and you know,

1376
00:57:26,021 --> 00:57:29,620
he's rehearsed it like 30 times the way 
I want it to be.

1377
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,510
Like I literally started thinking,
when is my tablet live?

1378
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,940
We're going to touch my bottom lip 
again.

1379
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,950
Right?
Like that's her walked around all day,

1380
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:40,370
just jog and people knew I'm walking all
day like I was like,

1381
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,490
you bet.
Yeah.

1382
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:44,680
Well that was kind of a loose official.
Was that each book?

1383
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:47,640
Was it Chris Gaines or was it garth 
brooks and that video and Keith,

1384
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:49,390
who knows?
I thought it was garth brooks.

1385
00:57:49,391 --> 00:57:51,370
But you raise a good point.
Let me show you.

1386
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:52,204
First of all,
let me just give you guys the premise 

1387
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:54,791
here.
Garth Brooks,

1388
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:57,340
you guys all know Garth Brooks.
That's Garth Brooks.

1389
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,080
Maybe give a short sprint of people that
don't know carf books.

1390
00:58:01,081 --> 00:58:02,730
He's a country singer.
He's like the most fun.

1391
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:06,100
He's like one of the biggest artists.
Do you listen to country music?

1392
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,070
Uh,
no I don't at all apps.

1393
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,180
Does it trip you out?

1394
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,013
Cause it does trip me out.
Country music is the most popular genre 

1395
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:15,860
of music and America.
And that just sounds like,

1396
00:58:15,861 --> 00:58:17,620
whoa.
Most of us are idiots,

1397
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,593
right?
Yeah.

1398
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,430
Country Music is,
is,

1399
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:25,750
and I'm not saying it's not for smart 
people as well,

1400
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:30,940
but it's the easiest music to listen to.
If you're a dummy,

1401
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:34,330
do you know what I mean?
Like it's the easiest music to get.

1402
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,970
I'm not saying that it doesn't have its 
smart songs.

1403
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,253
Maybe it does,
but like you can understand why a dumb 

1404
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,210
motherfucker listens to it.
Well,

1405
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,400
it was a transformative moment for me 
when,

1406
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:45,950
uh,
yeah,

1407
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:49,690
all the country fans out there,
the both pockets.

1408
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,770
I don't wear a cowboy hat.
Also.

1409
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,810
Don't ever have a goatee,
dude.

1410
00:58:55,890 --> 00:59:00,890
If you're go the whole way bro,
go the whole way.

1411
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,801
Well,
he almost,

1412
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:05,590
he looks like the human body.
Men of King of the hill.

1413
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:06,423
I mean,
yeah,

1414
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:08,200
that's who we're dealing.
And then Chris Angel,

1415
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,420
right?
So I just looked it up.

1416
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,273
Uh,
he's the number two bestselling artists 

1417
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:14,770
of all time,
only behind the Beatles.

1418
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,340
Oh my God.
This world is,

1419
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,150
there's 300 million people in the 
country.

1420
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,560
Okay.
5 million live in La.

1421
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:28,250
I had never in my whole life heard 
almost even a single country song.

1422
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,280
And then when I realized when I'm 18 
that it's the most popular,

1423
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,203
that garth brooks is the best selling 
artists ever after the fucking Beatles 

1424
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:38,590
over Michael Jackson.
Uh,

1425
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,210
number three is a elvis.
I had,

1426
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,593
I had this real like almost 
transformative like moment where I was 

1427
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:48,020
like,
oh my God.

1428
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:51,290
Like there's a whole nother world out 
there.

1429
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:55,100
You just feel it.
Also really big in Canada.

1430
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,780
A country music.
Really?

1431
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,850
Yup.
Yup.

1432
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,470
Twisted.
I knew it all along,

1433
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,120
but now I've got evidence.
Yeah,

1434
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,260
Dude.

1435
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,730
Um,
so,

1436
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,950
uh,
it's a country music is,

1437
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:08,120
yeah.
Come on dude.

1438
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,850
Well this guy's a fucking goofball.
So this is number two.

1439
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:11,684
Okay.
This guy sold this shit to the whole 

1440
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:14,520
damn country.
People are getting so angry right now.

1441
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:16,560
All of these girls books fans,
but I haven't,

1442
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,380
nobody's real,
nobody is listening to the show.

1443
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,210
The since the Garth Brooks,
somehow the world is that segmented.

1444
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:24,103
Oh,
it definitely.

1445
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,450
So,
so he carves brooks,

1446
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:29,540
who's known for his country music makes 
this alter ego.

1447
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:30,740
Chris Gaines.
Hey,

1448
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:33,450
don't even have your first ego.
Yeah,

1449
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,170
right,
right.

1450
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,600
It makes the first one better.
Right?

1451
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:43,460
That's more work on Garth Brooks.
Right?

1452
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:44,383
Well,
I mean,

1453
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,120
listen,
he's number two true.

1454
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:51,830
I mean he's number fucking fuck do I 
know we just,

1455
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:55,020
we need to acknowledge is in the tea 
sold more.

1456
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,040
Jump out the fucking window Jackie.
Jack liked it then it would be number.

1457
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:02,750
Yeah,
true.

1458
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,960
The Beatles would be like,
who the fucking who?

1459
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,290
The WHO also very bad.
I don't know.

1460
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:09,124
I'm,
I don't,

1461
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,670
you can say shit about the Beatles if it
can be,

1462
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,880
what are they singing about?
You know,

1463
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:18,240
I heard,
I know it was,

1464
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,180
it was not.
Let's not,

1465
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,400
let's not do what Garth Brooks and 
Beatles.

1466
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,670
I don't want to sound like the Beatles 
are just your favorite band.

1467
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,800
Mr fucking listening party.
You know what?

1468
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:28,520
I don't,
I don't,

1469
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,110
I don't,
I'm not really big on music really.

1470
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,520
My favorite is to parked.
That's it.

1471
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,870
That's as far as it goes.
I like a baggy.

1472
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:35,870
Will.
What do you like Peggy?

1473
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:37,340
I like to park.
Oh,

1474
01:01:37,341 --> 01:01:39,050
so you still holding onto the garage?
Yeah,

1475
01:01:39,051 --> 01:01:40,600
I like to park.
No,

1476
01:01:40,601 --> 01:01:41,241
I don't know.
Yeah,

1477
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:42,270
I don't,
I like to park.

1478
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,990
People say Tupac or Biggie.
It's like what did I like them both.

1479
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,780
You can like them both.
I like to,

1480
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,290
and Biggie was,
I mean,

1481
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,670
he was a great rapper.
He was a great,

1482
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:50,390
you know,
he,

1483
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:51,223
his float was fucking amazing.
But come on until you stopped listening 

1484
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:57,170
to music in the 90 minutes.
Like,

1485
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,990
because here's the other thing,
biggie rapped about his,

1486
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:02,270
there were stories.
They weren't how he was very much.

1487
01:02:02,271 --> 01:02:03,530
The story wasn't,
it wasn't,

1488
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:06,950
it wasn't necessarily about his life.
Sure.

1489
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:09,590
To parks shit was about his life and 
that shit.

1490
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,520
I thought it was awesome.
Well,

1491
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:12,080
I am a huge Tupac Fan.
Oh,

1492
01:02:12,081 --> 01:02:13,910
I'm not going to discount Tupac.
I mean,

1493
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:14,744
he's,
he's got all the hits and much like 

1494
01:02:15,741 --> 01:02:20,070
Garth Brooks,
they have

1495
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,060
a lot in common.
Yeah,

1496
01:02:21,061 --> 01:02:22,110
that's correct.
They have a lot.

1497
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:25,530
It really just,
when I say Tupac,

1498
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:28,920
the first thing that comes to mind is 
king of the hill over here.

1499
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,270
I don't know.
Uh,

1500
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,520
but yeah,
that facebook thing,

1501
01:02:32,521 --> 01:02:33,331
when it happened,
I can't,

1502
01:02:33,331 --> 01:02:35,640
I don't know if I put up a video making 
fun of it.

1503
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:36,360
Really.
No,

1504
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,280
I sent it.
You don't listen to music.

1505
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:39,760
I kind of got to go back to that.
I mean,

1506
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,190
that's trying to strain.
Yeah.

1507
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,710
I'm not ever listen to music.
I mean,

1508
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,544
I listen to hip hop,
but who's your favorite artists these 

1509
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,430
days?
Days.

1510
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,500
Um,
I don't know.

1511
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,450
I'm not that passionate about it.
Well,

1512
01:02:53,451 --> 01:02:54,650
there's no one,
right?

1513
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:55,460
Yeah.
Okay.

1514
01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:00,460
Like people,
I don't know.

1515
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:01,750
Okay.
I'm like,

1516
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,010
like,
like I,

1517
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:06,650
I realize like,
like j Cole is fucking awesome.

1518
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,780
You like Kendrick?
I mean,

1519
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:13,430
I it Kendrick's fine.
You know what?

1520
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,190
It's interesting you prefer j Cole for 
over Kendrick.

1521
01:03:16,191 --> 01:03:16,850
Yeah.
Dan,

1522
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:19,490
um,
j Cole fans rejoice.

1523
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:25,010
Kendrick is like Kendrick,
the reason why I'm not a hundred percent

1524
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:29,540
sold on Kendrick is because he doesn't 
wrap in the voice that he talks,

1525
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,770
which is,
which is like,

1526
01:03:33,771 --> 01:03:35,390
he does like this kind of Shit,
you know?

1527
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:37,900
Whereas like j Cole,
he's a lot of different stuff.

1528
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,090
Yeah,
he does.

1529
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:39,601
Yeah.
But,

1530
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:41,260
but,
but that's one of the reasons why I,

1531
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:44,840
I don't,
I liked that I liked the authentic,

1532
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,790
this is who I am.
This is what we do.

1533
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,360
Park would be like,
fuck this,

1534
01:03:50,361 --> 01:03:52,070
fuck that.
And then come up and be like,

1535
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,110
so we're doing this fucking interview.
And you're like,

1536
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,920
oh,
that's how he talks.

1537
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:55,753
Yeah.
Do you know what I mean?

1538
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:56,780
It,
you're a fan.

1539
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:59,690
I can tell you're a very much a fan of 
authenticity.

1540
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:00,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1541
01:04:00,771 --> 01:04:01,760
That's what I like.
Yeah.

1542
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:02,653
I mean,
you have this whole thing you've talked 

1543
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:08,840
about on your podcast about if you're 
being disrespectful,

1544
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:10,490
they're actually being respectful.
Yeah.

1545
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:11,980
Because you're,
you're,

1546
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:14,810
you're respecting a person enough to,
to do what you want to do,

1547
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,700
even though big frankly,
nor,

1548
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,010
uh,
uh,

1549
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:20,210
like if I would've put my feet up on the
table,

1550
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,980
I'm respecting you enough to be me.
And if I'm like put,

1551
01:04:24,981 --> 01:04:27,200
take your fucking feet off the table,
what the fuck's wrong with you?

1552
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,020
I would take them down because it's your
place ultimately.

1553
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,190
But because,
but,

1554
01:04:31,191 --> 01:04:32,930
but you are welcome to about it.
Yeah,

1555
01:04:32,931 --> 01:04:33,591
no,
I understand.

1556
01:04:33,591 --> 01:04:35,420
But like I,
I wouldn't think you'd care,

1557
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:40,421
but,
but my point is I'm me being me,

1558
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:41,624
allowing myself to be,
feel comfortable around you is like the 

1559
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:45,560
most intimate shit.

1560
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,920
That's true.
So if I put my feet up on your table,

1561
01:04:48,921 --> 01:04:50,660
I feel very comfortable with you guys.
Right.

1562
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,900
And I'm not,
it's not like I'm saying like,

1563
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,430
Oh,
you guys are so lucky.

1564
01:04:55,431 --> 01:04:56,960
I'm comfortable around you.
It's just,

1565
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:59,150
it's just make it,
it makes us,

1566
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,073
it makes me feel close to you.
It's like when I make fun of people and 

1567
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:04,430
people are like,
what are you talking shit?

1568
01:05:04,431 --> 01:05:06,380
Like I'm not dude.
Like my whole family growing up,

1569
01:05:06,381 --> 01:05:07,730
whenever we grew,
when we were growing up,

1570
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:12,080
all we did was bust on each other.
That's all we did all day long.

1571
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:13,820
My Mom,
my dad,

1572
01:05:13,821 --> 01:05:15,320
my brother,
my uncles,

1573
01:05:15,321 --> 01:05:18,130
my aunt like we would make of you.
That's how we showed

1574
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:18,963
love.
And like,

1575
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:21,370
so when people are like,
hey man,

1576
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,800
why are you making fun of me?
Which happens every now and then.

1577
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:26,830
You're like,
what did I,

1578
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:30,610
it's like giving you a hug,
like literally interesting in my mind.

1579
01:05:30,611 --> 01:05:31,444
And I get that that's not like that for 
everybody and people have different 

1580
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:34,750
upbringings.
So I'm sensitive to that.

1581
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:36,460
But yeah,
to me it's like if,

1582
01:05:36,461 --> 01:05:37,294
if you are comfortable enough to be you,
that's the most respect you can give to 

1583
01:05:40,241 --> 01:05:41,074
me.
Interesting.

1584
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:44,470
This truth to that.
Do I think I fucking honestly sound like

1585
01:05:44,471 --> 01:05:46,150
a cult leader for real?
Well that's,

1586
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,680
well,
I wonder if Garth,

1587
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,810
I wonder how God feels about that 
statement.

1588
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:52,660
You can join the cult.
It's a return back to,

1589
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:55,090
um,
to we never a chat cause we have,

1590
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,290
yeah,
we have to wash this.

1591
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:57,310
Yeah.
But anyway,

1592
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,100
that you can tell what a fucking 
goofball he is.

1593
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:00,701
Oh yeah.
For sure.

1594
01:06:00,701 --> 01:06:02,380
What this dime store,
you know,

1595
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:03,620
either,
either picture is,

1596
01:06:03,621 --> 01:06:06,550
is ridiculous.
Ridiculous.

1597
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:07,413
Yeah.
He looks like a fucking thumb and look 

1598
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:12,760
at his face.
It's weird because country like,

1599
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:14,860
couldn't be cool.
It could be.

1600
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:17,800
Yeah.
Well some of it probably is.

1601
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:21,550
I don't really know Corny,
the kind of country I know.

1602
01:06:21,551 --> 01:06:23,890
It was just like a twinkie and all 
about,

1603
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:24,783
you know,
there's that one that was so popular I 

1604
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:26,824
fucking hate.
It was about,

1605
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:30,520
I'm a little drunk and I need you now.
You remember that one?

1606
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,570
The lyrics were so dumb.
It's like every country song is like,

1607
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:37,090
let me,
I fucking saw you once and you're like,

1608
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,470
and then they're like,
I fucking can't get you out of my head.

1609
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:44,320
It was like,
you know what I want to do?

1610
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:46,660
I want to Redo the first of all,
let's,

1611
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,230
okay.

1612
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:49,190
I mean,
250 million.

1613
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:50,080
Well,
that's too many.

1614
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:51,250
Yeah.
Oh,

1615
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,440
that's too Max.
She was expecting more to be frank,

1616
01:06:53,441 --> 01:06:54,274
but I,
I heard this song every fucking where 

1617
01:06:56,910 --> 01:07:00,520
for a long ass time.
It's a quarter after one.

1618
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:02,980
I'm all alone and I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call,

1619
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:03,814
but I'm lost all control.
I need you to now another shot of 

1620
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:07,714
whiskey.
Can't stop looking at the door wishing 

1621
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:10,930
you come sweep in my way.
You know what?

1622
01:07:10,931 --> 01:07:11,764
Here it is.
I'm a little drunk and I need you now 

1623
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,060
that I don't know what that really bog 
awesome.

1624
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,130
Perfect.
I'm a little bit wrong.

1625
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:19,030
It's like,
it's like,

1626
01:07:19,031 --> 01:07:20,920
can you find a more poetic way to say 
that?

1627
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:22,391
Said,
I wouldn't call,

1628
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:25,360
but I've lost all control.
I don't know what it is about this line.

1629
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:27,580
It drove me crazy.
I'm a little drunk and I need,

1630
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:28,750
you know,
I like that.

1631
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,600
That drove you crazy because she's not 
even actually drunk.

1632
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,940
Just so I'm a little drunk,
bitch.

1633
01:07:33,941 --> 01:07:35,470
Get Ahold of your life.
You know what that is?

1634
01:07:35,471 --> 01:07:38,520
That's a fucking bro right there.
[inaudible] need.

1635
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:41,890
You know I realized that it's not as bad
as I thought.

1636
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,670
All acknowledge that too.
No,

1637
01:07:43,671 --> 01:07:44,250
no,
no,

1638
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,083
you don't.
Honestly,

1639
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:46,503
it is as bad as you thought and I agree 
with you back Batman guy who plays 

1640
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:52,070
foosball wouldn't say all right.
I'm a little dry.

1641
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,790
It's so pedestrian,
but that's what they love drunk.

1642
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:56,713
I you do.
Now I can sit for that red cup down and 

1643
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,613
get off the foosball too.
You want to get together some time and 

1644
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,520
do enlist preview Kanye album listening.
We'll fly to Miami.

1645
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:10,850
I'll just meet you.

1646
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,380
All right.
Let's get to fucking,

1647
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:18,420
this is just this,
we're going to have to break down.

1648
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,730
How many views does it have?
Well,

1649
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,593
I think it's been uploaded.
You ripped like how many pets do really 

1650
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:28,000
shitty rehab bloated but 150,002
out.

1651
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,670
By the way,
let's just say look at the title.

1652
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:34,760
Let's just say before we even start 
this,

1653
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:38,870
facebook had been up and running for 25 
years.

1654
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:42,750
Yeah.
This in like Brett,

1655
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,240
no,
there's nothing groundbreaking.

1656
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:48,280
But just imagine this guy is more famous
to Michael Jackson.

1657
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,131
I know,
but here's,

1658
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:52,370
here's something garth brooks has 
definitely said before,

1659
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:53,270
something like this,
like,

1660
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:55,040
I don't know how much milk is,
what is it?

1661
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:57,440
$15 and you're like,
no,

1662
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,310
you're not.
You're not salt of the earth at all.

1663
01:09:00,311 --> 01:09:01,144
Yeah,
yeah.

1664
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,740
Here's,
here's $50 go get a carton of milk.

1665
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:05,270
Like that's what he's done.
And you're like,

1666
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:07,580
okay.
You know what I'm curious about that.

1667
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:12,110
I want to check really fast.
Garth Brooks net worth is this guy worth

1668
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:16,040
300 million?
It could be worth more.

1669
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,830
It's a lot.
A lot of milk.

1670
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,430
Okay.
That's like 10,

1671
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:24,500
10 gallons of milk.
So anyway,

1672
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:28,670
lit,
amazing us and she began trench warfare.

1673
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:31,460
So anyway,
this is his first facebook upload.

1674
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:31,910
We've,
we've,

1675
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:33,270
we've introduced it enough,
right?

1676
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:34,700
Um,
where's my mouse button?

1677
01:09:34,701 --> 01:09:35,660
For Christ's sake.
Okay,

1678
01:09:35,661 --> 01:09:36,210
here we go.

1679
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,230
Well,
I guess it's official.

1680
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:38,910
We're now on facebook.

1681
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,140
You know,
he rehearsed that little chuckle.

1682
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,630
Yeah.
Wow.

1683
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,500
Okay.
And it's really annoying.

1684
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:48,460
And here's the other thing that started 
with,

1685
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:50,740
well,
the official,

1686
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:54,640
like we know already what the fuck this 
is about.

1687
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,760
That makes me want to fucking jump off a
bridge.

1688
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,073
The rehearsing,
the thing is he's trying so hard to be 

1689
01:10:00,641 --> 01:10:04,030
authentic,
but it comes off like you can't rehearse

1690
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:06,260
a chuckle,
like it's so fucking awesome.

1691
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:09,150
But he didn't get them had fishel.
We're now on facebook.

1692
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,550
[inaudible] had to be authentic and 
fucking 40 years old.

1693
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:13,750
Why?
He doesn't know what it's like.

1694
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,570
Yeah.
We're now on facebook.

1695
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,510
We're now on facebook.

1696
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,150
I really wasn't sure about this at the 
start,

1697
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:24,450
but then a friend of mine said something
that just made all kinds of sense.

1698
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:29,100
It was just publicity that I like that.

1699
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:35,140
All right.
You know what I liked?

1700
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:39,060
I like that.
It's almost like a dating video.

1701
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:40,763
It's like,
I like do like this is like the saddest 

1702
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,730
fucking dating video ever.
You'd be like,

1703
01:10:47,731 --> 01:10:49,600
this guy's probably on a sex offender 
list.

1704
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:51,403
I like that.

1705
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:54,210
It's something they just made all kinds 
of sense.

1706
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,790
She should think of it more as a 
conversation.

1707
01:10:58,140 --> 01:10:58,973
I like that.

1708
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:00,130
Oh,
right.

1709
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,510
He's like,
it's so calculated.

1710
01:11:01,511 --> 01:11:02,800
Pause,
smile,

1711
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:03,820
chuckle.
I like,

1712
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:07,330
I like to think that he forgot about 
what he was talking about.

1713
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:11,740
The defendant thought of tits,
like what you can see.

1714
01:11:11,741 --> 01:11:16,741
I'm registering to go,
go back and do I like that.

1715
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:21,420
Be Happy,
garth.

1716
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:23,610
That's what happened.
Titties

1717
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:27,710
what I'm already finding out on my own,
so it's wiping the walls out between you

1718
01:11:27,711 --> 01:11:29,570
and me and I really liked that.

1719
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:33,200
Do the way he drilled that.
I really like that.

1720
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:33,961
It's like,
Damn.

1721
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:37,670
It's honestly very weird.
It is like a flirting.

1722
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,710
Yeah.
He's trying to fuck me on face.

1723
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:41,563
Showing it also,
or is somebody he's close to his face 

1724
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:47,300
has no pants.
That would be the best.

1725
01:11:47,301 --> 01:11:49,040
He's got no pants on.
Just a shirt.

1726
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,670
I'm going to put a shirt on him.
They below this and he's in a hotel room

1727
01:11:52,671 --> 01:11:53,840
apparently.
He says,

1728
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:54,551
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1729
01:11:54,551 --> 01:11:56,270
yeah.
I really liked that.

1730
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,990
I love the fucking guy falls out between
the human thumb.

1731
01:11:59,991 --> 01:12:01,010
Look at his face.
He's like,

1732
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,310
it's just a thumb with features me and I
really liked that.

1733
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:10,480
I really like that.
Really like that.

1734
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:14,410
It allows us into each other's worlds 
where I can,

1735
01:12:14,411 --> 01:12:15,244
I guess in my case a hotel room.
When I think about things I want to 

1736
01:12:19,871 --> 01:12:21,790
post,
I want to post cool stuff.

1737
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:22,773
Slick stuff.
You need stuff neat for most of the 

1738
01:12:25,401 --> 01:12:27,430
stuff I'm going to post is going to be 
raw stuff like this.

1739
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,740
This is raw as it gets baby on the 
hundredth try.

1740
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:36,900
Oh,
kind of makes my skin crawl.

1741
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:38,500
Yeah,
no it might weird.

1742
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:40,050
It might be

1743
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:41,690
okay.

1744
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,850
It might be the greatest video on the 
Internet.

1745
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,810
That's why I'm so glad that we're 
watching.

1746
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,680
It might be the watching this again,
there's so much going on.

1747
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:53,100
Might be it should have more views than 
I am.

1748
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,020
Finding that it was the first thing you 
said the facebook video and like,

1749
01:12:57,230 --> 01:12:59,640
cause I have no one talks about it.
I know,

1750
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,353
I mean it,
it definitely got a lot of use because 

1751
01:13:02,361 --> 01:13:03,194
it's him,
right?

1752
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:04,400
Not Enough.
Not,

1753
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:06,800
yeah.
Well why wasn't,

1754
01:13:06,801 --> 01:13:09,560
this is what he's is.
They shouldn't be.

1755
01:13:09,561 --> 01:13:11,210
What he's known for.
Yeah.

1756
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,130
Well cause that's why I said,
cause that when you bring up,

1757
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,270
anytime anyone brings up goldbergs this 
is what I,

1758
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:17,970
the from facebook videos.
Yeah.

1759
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:19,170
Yeah.
The facebook guy,

1760
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,900
they're like mark Zuckerberg.
None of them got back.

1761
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,320
The facebook guy,
you know Chris gain.

1762
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:29,000
Yeah.
Slick stuff.

1763
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,520
The guy looks up what can only pour all 
the ports,

1764
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,270
raw stuff.
I like that.

1765
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:35,480
I like that.
I really like,

1766
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:40,330
it's just who I am.

1767
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:44,910
Let's go back and kind of enjoy this 
whole last,

1768
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,820
because it's just who I,
he's a grown

1769
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:48,753
all right.
But most of the stuff I'm going to post 

1770
01:13:50,241 --> 01:13:54,500
is going to be raw stuff like this.
It's just who I am.

1771
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:59,150
So this is truly a conversation.
Then I say,

1772
01:13:59,151 --> 01:14:00,830
let the conversation begin.

1773
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,713
All right,
I'll take off my pants and I'm putting 

1774
01:14:04,621 --> 01:14:06,060
my dick out on the web.
Webcam.

1775
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,200
Isla.
It sounds to me like you're not ready to

1776
01:14:10,201 --> 01:14:12,030
let the conversation begin.
It's just

1777
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,873
not,
yeah.

1778
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,920
Well don't push back.
Also.

1779
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:17,580
Did it even begin after this?
Yeah,

1780
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:18,463
yeah.
Yeah.

1781
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,640
Well they got rolled into oblivion.
Everyone on the Internet.

1782
01:14:21,641 --> 01:14:24,460
Again,
I think just the buddies way to end your

1783
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:25,294
video.
When you think about start and finish 

1784
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:28,920
the day that day.
It's just,

1785
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:29,973
it's just very,
the fact that like a guy can be 

1786
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:41,350
thinking,
this is the thing that fascinates me the

1787
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:46,351
most out of for humans for since I've 
been an adult,

1788
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,790
this is the thing that's fascinating.
Most,

1789
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,420
this is also my,
my number one nightmare to be

1790
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:57,350
the way you think.
You're not being to come across.

1791
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:59,400
He thinks he's being authentic.
Yeah.

1792
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:02,130
It's the exact opposite is happening.
Interest.

1793
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:04,490
You watch that and you think,
oh that's,

1794
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:05,653
and he doesn't realize it.
That's my biggest nightmare is to walk 

1795
01:15:06,921 --> 01:15:08,860
into a role in understand what you mean.
Yeah.

1796
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,380
But do you think that he,
like he's,

1797
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,880
this is clearly extremely rehearsed.
Yes.

1798
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:17,570
So you think it's possible for someone 
to almost be,

1799
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,640
have that duality of mine?
Sure.

1800
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:20,474
It's possible.
Yeah,

1801
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:21,890
definitely.
He could be doing that.

1802
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:22,910
Yeah.
Maybe he is,

1803
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:26,930
but either way it sucks.
Either way.

1804
01:15:26,931 --> 01:15:29,330
It's fucking so funny and crazy.
Yeah.

1805
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:30,380
Like,
come on dude.

1806
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:31,423
I,
yeah,

1807
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:34,070
I I,
I don't know.

1808
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,440
Maybe it's cause I'm a comedian and like
I,

1809
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:39,890
you have to let people kind of know who 
you are for it to work.

1810
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,050
Unless you're going to do like a 
character,

1811
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,770
which I don't do,
but like you have a podcast,

1812
01:15:46,771 --> 01:15:47,480
you know,
you know you're,

1813
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,510
yeah,
you can't,

1814
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,720
you're not some corny radio hosts like 
that.

1815
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:53,580
That's what he is,
you know,

1816
01:15:53,581 --> 01:15:54,430
and it's,
I wonder,

1817
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:56,270
do you think he drinks lacroix?

1818
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:58,733
No,
definitely drinks coke and he 

1819
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:03,070
definitely,
if he does go to,

1820
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,920
he's going to drink sparkling water.
It's for sure that high end like that.

1821
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:06,763
Yeah.
They're a high end ones that I find 

1822
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,010
bubbles.
Bubbles.

1823
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:15,570
He's drinking soda with Cherry Syrup in 
it with a big ass green Straw.

1824
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,830
Yup.
Yup.

1825
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,240
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1826
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:21,450
He's done well.
I really liked that.

1827
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,760
I think glass,
I liked that.

1828
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,080
A thin Straw.
Oh really?

1829
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:31,280
Liked.
I really liked that.

1830
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:36,020
Kind of got to get let it hang big game.
Yeah,

1831
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:37,200
I hear it man.
This is,

1832
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,990
I almost want it.
I want to recreate it.

1833
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:41,880
I want to upload this to my youtube 
channel.

1834
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,620
I'm edited.
I think.

1835
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:48,090
I think I did this and then uploaded it.
Are you serious?

1836
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,650
You did you recreate it it,
yeah,

1837
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:51,480
I know.
I really,

1838
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:56,510
I know I sent the video to jr row.
I know I sent it to Joe.

1839
01:16:57,991 --> 01:16:58,360
Right.
Okay.

1840
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,180
Let's see what happens.
And I think the Brian Cowen,

1841
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:05,210
I don't know if I ever uploaded it.
This is from five months ago.

1842
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:10,160
Some

1843
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,810
random person.
It wasn't hill.

1844
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,530
Oh,
but somehow this ended on,

1845
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,590
it's just five months ago.
It's not even that long ago.

1846
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:17,870
Oh yeah.
So somebody found,

1847
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:21,770
well that's why I guess it's official,
Tim first.

1848
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,630
I really wasn't sure about this at the 
start.

1849
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:24,973
Oh,
so it's back to back and I will say 

1850
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:29,150
this,
I,

1851
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,333
I didn't write it down.
I watched it so many times from patch 

1852
01:17:33,951 --> 01:17:35,880
that I did it.
This is from,

1853
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:36,763
I remember,
I remember straight feeling and 

1854
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:39,640
authenticity.
Yeah.

1855
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:45,280
I really liked that.
Crepey I can't believe for,

1856
01:17:45,851 --> 01:17:48,010
I need to acknowledge that this is 
pretty wild.

1857
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,880
This is pretty insane that this exists 
in front of you.

1858
01:17:51,881 --> 01:17:53,290
Thought you'd bring it up.
I'm like,

1859
01:17:53,291 --> 01:17:54,124
Bro,
I'm like,

1860
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:56,170
I want to recreate this.

1861
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,930
Well,
you're in a hotel room.

1862
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,090
I'm immersed.
Well,

1863
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,590
I guess it's official.
We're on facebook.

1864
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:11,010
You know?
I really wasn't sure about this a bit.

1865
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:13,530
A friend of mine said something that 
made all kinds of sense.

1866
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,800
She said,
just think of it as a conversation.

1867
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:22,260
I like that you want,
I'm already noticing myself is that it's

1868
01:18:22,261 --> 01:18:24,930
whacking away the walls of communication
between you and me.

1869
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:27,150
Well,
not really like that.

1870
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:31,500
It allows us to take a look at line as 
an invitation to,

1871
01:18:31,501 --> 01:18:36,030
fuck.
That's a fucking,

1872
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,560
that's a,
let's fuck.

1873
01:18:37,561 --> 01:18:41,810
I think facebook was,
he thought it was a dating site.

1874
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,020
Yeah,
yeah,

1875
01:18:43,021 --> 01:18:43,401
yeah,
yeah.

1876
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:45,020
Everybody can see this.
Yeah.

1877
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,690
Fuck.
All right.

1878
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,080
We're each other's worlds,
or in my case,

1879
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,160
my hotel room.

1880
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,380
What do think about the things I want to
post,

1881
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,880
what to post?
Cool stuff,

1882
01:18:56,881 --> 01:18:58,470
slick stuff,
neat stuff,

1883
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,053
but I'm probably going to end up posting
brow stuff like this because it's who I 

1884
01:19:04,171 --> 01:19:05,230
am.
Yeah.

1885
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,221
Well,
like you said,

1886
01:19:07,221 --> 01:19:10,830
if this is a conversation,
then I say lit.

1887
01:19:10,831 --> 01:19:15,160
The conversation began.
I cannot believe.

1888
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:19,830
I cannot believe that was,
that was,

1889
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,350
I got to say I'm blown away.
Yeah.

1890
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,190
Here we are right now.
That's weird.

1891
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:25,770
No wiring,
own video that we're live right now,

1892
01:19:25,771 --> 01:19:28,140
broadly as it's being suggested.
Wow.

1893
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,620
Well,
yeah,

1894
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:31,050
that's a strange one.
All right,

1895
01:19:31,051 --> 01:19:32,300
let's get off of Youtube.
That's,

1896
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:36,630
so,
that was such a good luck.

1897
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:37,231
We were like,
Hey,

1898
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,064
let's bring this up,
but not let every week we did not 

1899
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,950
meditate that,
I'm so glad that we were both were found

1900
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,800
common ground on that.
Yeah.

1901
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:48,450
I can't think of one.

1902
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:50,670
Garth Brooks Song.
Not One.

1903
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:52,740
Uh,
you know,

1904
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,140
our guests,
I can either here at Garden Grove Roping

1905
01:19:55,141 --> 01:19:57,630
in the wind or was that someone else 
roping in the wind?

1906
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:59,480
There's that something like,
damn,

1907
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:02,940
he's kind of,
he's kind of looking a little porky.

1908
01:20:02,941 --> 01:20:05,490
Piggish right now.
Does that mean,

1909
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,010
does that racist against,
no,

1910
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:07,883
I just think that when you get older,
I feel like everyone's just kinda gets 

1911
01:20:11,491 --> 01:20:12,324
bigger.
What do you think about the top on the 

1912
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:17,040
cab?
How it's just killer.

1913
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:19,050
Like what are you doing?
That's pretty killer though.

1914
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:22,380
I got to start doing that.
I really liked the Campbell.

1915
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,273
The bow tie I look is pretty cool.
You like it well do you like well it 

1916
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:32,181
looks cool on some people like people 
wanting to fuck him.

1917
01:20:32,491 --> 01:20:33,324
I mean he was a sex icon.
This man right here is the sex I was 

1918
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:41,180
fresh faced.
Include wire.

1919
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:44,340
I will never wear a button down with no 
color.

1920
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:47,100
That's like what are you doing?
That's what you got our haircut.

1921
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:51,420
That's why you'll never be the number 
two selling artists.

1922
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:54,173
But what I am curious about,
let's just hop back on over to youtube 

1923
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:57,373
cause then I liked doing this where you 
can type the artists and sort by most 

1924
01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:02,010
popular.
So let's see what kind of,

1925
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:03,570
there we are again.
For Christ's sake.

1926
01:21:03,571 --> 01:21:04,404
It's weird.
Well I've know garth brooks filter view 

1927
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:11,010
count.
Oh,

1928
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:11,844
okay.
Yeah,

1929
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:13,950
that's it.
I guess he's just,

1930
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:16,230
he's been around too long because that 
is what it is.

1931
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,430
I've been around too long.
31 34 millions is is.

1932
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,530
Yeah,
because fucking Migos has 4 trillion.

1933
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,193
Yeah.
Gangnam style is more puppies than cars 

1934
01:21:25,651 --> 01:21:30,270
broken apparently on youtube uploads to 
cause.

1935
01:21:30,271 --> 01:21:32,530
Look at the channels.
It's not even anything.

1936
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,050
You're not afraid.
Am I tripping or is this the same guy?

1937
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:39,880
The uploaded your video?
No.

1938
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,210
Okay.
Let's get it out of this.

1939
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:44,520
Wow.
Let's get it as quick.

1940
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:47,970
That was amazing.
I just want to talk about cardboard.

1941
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:50,280
I'm being frank and I see you have your 
feet up.

1942
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:52,020
Thank you for doing that.
Yeah,

1943
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:55,020
no problem.
No problem.

1944
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:56,940
Um,
you,

1945
01:21:56,941 --> 01:21:59,610
uh,
the kind of talked about this,

1946
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:02,370
about how you hate could Chella you hate
the listening parties.

1947
01:22:02,371 --> 01:22:03,720
You hate the woos.
Yeah.

1948
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:07,530
Is there anything on your top,
on your list of things that you hate,

1949
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:08,573
the kind of want you've been thinking 
about that you want to talk about a 

1950
01:22:10,211 --> 01:22:11,460
little bit?
Um,

1951
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,910
something that's Kinda hit you lately,
recently.

1952
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:17,680
New anoosh thing.
I don't know.

1953
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,360
I,
I talk about it all the time on my,

1954
01:22:21,361 --> 01:22:23,370
and it's not that I hated,
it's just that it irks me,

1955
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:24,620
but yeah,
Roger,

1956
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:27,090
uh,
the wrong way or whatever.

1957
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:29,280
But um,
I don't know.

1958
01:22:29,281 --> 01:22:30,750
The last thing was like the listening 
party.

1959
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:34,110
Like when I heard that over and come on.
What's going on in?

1960
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:38,400
I don't want to put you on the spot,
but the easy are good intern.

1961
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:39,563
He,
he was at one of those listening 

1962
01:22:41,311 --> 01:22:42,240
parties?
No,

1963
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:45,490
Ian can you grab the mic?
Oh,

1964
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:50,580
that was Ian.
Which listening party where you at?

1965
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:52,830
Kids see ghosts.
Oh really?

1966
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,230
Kids keep cutting.
That was in la,

1967
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,260
right?
Yeah.

1968
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:57,060
How was it?
When did she enjoy,

1969
01:22:57,061 --> 01:22:59,700
was it a great trends in dental 
experience?

1970
01:22:59,701 --> 01:23:02,040
Transcendental.
What the fuck are you talking about?

1971
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:07,590
Like what do you mean you were there?
What was it like?

1972
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:10,470
So you get there,
you park,

1973
01:23:10,471 --> 01:23:11,780
right?
Like a fucking asshole.

1974
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:12,820
You put the ticket,
you get,

1975
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,430
you get a ticket right to park.
Did you park on the street?

1976
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,143
Where'd you park mother fucker.
I want to know that cause I to imagine 

1977
01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:26,761
you walk into this fucking thing I 
parked like in this dirt field.

1978
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:28,471
Oh,
all right.

1979
01:23:28,471 --> 01:23:33,340
So that is pretty Bohemian.
I wanted it to be.

1980
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,010
I wish it was a good place where you 
were just like,

1981
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:36,850
yeah,
I just,

1982
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:38,590
I had to find a spot if people have to 
wait.

1983
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:42,460
Well I got to say it was super 
pretentious,

1984
01:23:42,461 --> 01:23:43,294
the whole parking situation cause they 
made us park and then put us on a 

1985
01:23:45,611 --> 01:23:49,300
shuttle and the shuttle drove literally 
for 30 seconds.

1986
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:50,163
We drove 30 seconds down the road and 
then they kicked us out of the shuttle 

1987
01:23:52,151 --> 01:23:52,601
and like,
all right,

1988
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:53,530
we're here.
So Ian,

1989
01:23:53,531 --> 01:23:55,330
you left that,
you admitted that detail.

1990
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,250
They're like,
you're wearing here we are.

1991
01:23:57,251 --> 01:23:58,450
And they're like,
why not?

1992
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,280
We could have it here and it gives you 
shit.

1993
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:04,560
So just play it and,
and,

1994
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:06,630
and I,
there was a bonfire right in.

1995
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,833
Yeah.
Yeah.

1996
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:08,501
Big,
big.

1997
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:10,930
You know why there's a bonfire.
You know why there's a bonfire?

1998
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:14,650
Because it distracts you from what a 
bunch of fucking idiots you guys are.

1999
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:16,690
Because if there was a bonfire,
he'd be like,

2000
01:24:16,691 --> 01:24:17,680
what the fuck are we doing here?

2001
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:21,053
You don't have a bump.
Right.

2002
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,040
Cause it's not something,
right.

2003
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:25,000
It's a bonfire.
You need a focal point.

2004
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:28,450
It's more of like there was a full 
buffet though.

2005
01:24:28,451 --> 01:24:32,190
There was all this.
That's kind of like it was a party.

2006
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:38,890
A party.
What party is in the title the best.

2007
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:41,500
If you were like,
oh well do you have any fucking anything

2008
01:24:41,501 --> 01:24:42,334
else?
Any others?

2009
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:46,750
Music cause you play,
you play hard knock life.

2010
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,820
Well they did play other music right?
You know it had 40 minutes,

2011
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,180
40 minutes.
It's a short one,

2012
01:24:52,181 --> 01:24:54,870
20 minutes because it's a short,
I'll pay in.

2013
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:57,200
Did you sense because it was such a 
short album was hurt.

2014
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:59,110
Any disappointment in the crowd when 
they're like,

2015
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,033
aw man,
I will say the crowd and Dan can attest 

2016
01:25:03,191 --> 01:25:04,024
to this.
I was dancing my ass off but everyone 

2017
01:25:06,491 --> 01:25:09,370
else was like too cool for yeah.
That's annoying.

2018
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:12,130
You been with the bonfire?
Yeah,

2019
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,320
it was like it was for most of the 
people there.

2020
01:25:14,321 --> 01:25:16,240
It seemed like it was more of a photo 
op.

2021
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:17,380
Yeah,
that's an Si.

2022
01:25:17,381 --> 01:25:22,381
That's Kuta.
Oh Man.

2023
01:25:22,811 --> 01:25:24,580
That's crazy man.
Why'd you go?

2024
01:25:24,581 --> 01:25:25,570
So why did you go then?
Why?

2025
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:28,230
What made it made you want to go?
I'm,

2026
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:31,650
I'm like a die hard as a super fan of 
Kanye.

2027
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,333
Gotcha.
I feel like he's going to get ripped 

2028
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:36,970
forever since I exposed the fake easy.
Yeah.

2029
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:37,990
We don't have to keep saying that.

2030
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:42,663
When I said fake easy.
Is that something that you were trying 

2031
01:25:44,621 --> 01:25:47,020
to keep secret?
Not to keep bringing it up,

2032
01:25:47,021 --> 01:25:47,854
but I'm just genuinely curious how 
people imagine you just don't bring it 

2033
01:25:50,501 --> 01:25:51,670
up.
You know,

2034
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:54,380
I didn't quite catch that.
Can you say the word easy?

2035
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:55,223
It's like maybe seven or more time.
You with a fake yeezys to the listening 

2036
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:00,873
party.
You look at you and be like at you and 

2037
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:08,291
be like real motherfucker.
There's a video of a fan doing that.

2038
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:11,920
Trying to get them to sign.
Oh whoa.

2039
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:14,840
Connie looks in eyes and goes,
those are fake.

2040
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:15,703
No Way.
So even con you cause the fakes look 

2041
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:20,540
good,
Connie.

2042
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:25,570
Has that makes it,
even if I hate it,

2043
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:30,950
it looks identical except like a couple 
of stitches or no,

2044
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:32,310
but he knows.
No Way.

2045
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:36,380
Isla would know because she will know if
someone copied your joke,

2046
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:38,750
you would know you came up with it.

2047
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:39,531
Okay.
Yeah.

2048
01:26:39,531 --> 01:26:40,520
You're probably right.
Yeah.

2049
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:41,560
Wow.
Yeah.

2050
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,350
Wow.
I like the stance you've taken though.

2051
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:47,050
Not Budget.
Where do you get Vicky's?

2052
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:53,570
It's a process and I frankly was 
intrigued by it.

2053
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:57,010
All right.
Maybe we should look,

2054
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,840
I made them do it.
If he did that,

2055
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:01,990
he's in fucking [inaudible] here on the 
side of him.

2056
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:04,460
Like that's,
that was the best.

2057
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:06,320
My jaw dropped.
Like the garth brooks video.

2058
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:07,154
I went,
oh,

2059
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:09,493
I can't help it.
Sometimes I've walked by these people 

2060
01:27:10,551 --> 01:27:13,970
and I go,
oh everyone's getting out of control.

2061
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:15,283
But you know,
talking about Kuna Matata cause we were 

2062
01:27:16,701 --> 01:27:17,534
at,
you know this club hoppies I've heard 

2063
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:20,343
about it.
We were hanging out or post Malone was 

2064
01:27:22,851 --> 01:27:23,684
at the Hollywood bowl last night.
He's a friend of ours and we went with 

2065
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:29,160
him afterwards to this club poppies and 
with the whole entourage and,

2066
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:31,220
and I'm thinking,
Oh yeah,

2067
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:32,210
cause he was on your podcast.

2068
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,880
Yeah.
And so I'm thinking,

2069
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:37,160
oh this could be interesting.
I don't really go up clubbing.

2070
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:40,100
It's so fucking small dude.
Poppy.

2071
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,090
It's,
yeah,

2072
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:43,070
the club is soldier.
The room.

2073
01:27:43,071 --> 01:27:44,610
I mean,
the room we're in is,

2074
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:47,990
oh,
this must be like illegally path.

2075
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,580
Wow.
It was so fun.

2076
01:27:49,581 --> 01:27:51,950
It was barely a specialty practice 
because he was there.

2077
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:52,581
Yeah.
Oh,

2078
01:27:52,581 --> 01:27:53,570
I'm sure.
I'm sure.

2079
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,480
But like there's people outside the 
lined up.

2080
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:58,500
I'm trying to get out.
Yeah.

2081
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:01,310
There's not even really an exit for 
people,

2082
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:06,770
but there's a lot of a short legal 
stefan.

2083
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:08,450
Yeah.
But what I,

2084
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:13,480
what I saw outside was,
was a lot of people like,

2085
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:17,150
I just actually don't know why anyone 
wouldn't want to be in there except post

2086
01:28:17,151 --> 01:28:18,380
malone.
Why?

2087
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:21,560
Because it's so fucking packed.
Why does he want to be in there?

2088
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:23,270
Because he's the center of attention.
He's there.

2089
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:24,230
Celebrate.
Right?

2090
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,970
Yeah.
I guess though,

2091
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:29,570
see that's the thing,
like I guess he parties,

2092
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:30,071
right?
Like,

2093
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:31,640
so if your party,
it's a different thing.

2094
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:33,290
I don't,
so like when I'm at,

2095
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:35,450
I'm a,
I'm a comedian and at my show,

2096
01:28:35,451 --> 01:28:37,640
and granted they're not as big as 
fucking post malone shows,

2097
01:28:37,641 --> 01:28:40,610
but like after that,
I didn't want to go somewhere.

2098
01:28:40,611 --> 01:28:42,030
You're done.
He's a young man.

2099
01:28:42,210 --> 01:28:45,640
He's 22 years old ass.
Fuck.

2100
01:28:45,641 --> 01:28:47,780
Holy Shit.
38 year old.

2101
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:54,020
I sometimes I forget because I'm 33 and 
that's kind of fucking like,

2102
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:55,910
I probably shouldn't even be talking 
anymore.

2103
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,780
I don't think anything talking.
Yeah,

2104
01:28:58,790 --> 01:29:00,220
I got one.
Um,

2105
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:01,980
actually one thing that I learned about 
you

2106
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,440
that did intrigue me,
why is that?

2107
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,341
Well,
first of all,

2108
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:09,210
let me say that I love your bit about 
the drunk girls driving and I'm like,

2109
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,073
Oh,
this guy has obviously spent a lot of 

2110
01:29:10,921 --> 01:29:11,754
times.
Yeah,

2111
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,920
you know,
but you don't actually,

2112
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,870
you don't drink,
you don't use drugs,

2113
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:19,320
you don't smoke cannabis know.
And I will say is that,

2114
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,453
have you ever tried these things?
And now I mean prefaces by saying I 

2115
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:28,491
always have to answer this question four
or five times in a row.

2116
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:33,540
I've literally never been drunk.
I've never done,

2117
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,850
I've never smoked weed,
never done any drugs,

2118
01:29:35,851 --> 01:29:36,601
never drank.
Well,

2119
01:29:36,601 --> 01:29:38,380
one of my favorite people ever.
Ever,

2120
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,030
ever.
Why surprising.

2121
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,490
But like,
well one of my favorite artists,

2122
01:29:44,491 --> 01:29:45,324
frank Zappa,
who was like the nerdiest guy of all 

2123
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:47,733
time and the guy that you think was on 
acid all the time was completely 

2124
01:29:49,981 --> 01:29:50,470
straight edge.

2125
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:52,980
I refuse to believe work with people who
use drugs.

2126
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:53,843
Oh Wow.
Really?

2127
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:54,683
I,
uh,

2128
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,153
I think it's really cool,
but I'm just curious what's the theory 

2129
01:29:58,531 --> 01:30:01,020
behind it?
So I don't,

2130
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:02,940
I,
I,

2131
01:30:02,941 --> 01:30:04,380
first of all,
when I was young,

2132
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:05,310
young,
okay,

2133
01:30:05,311 --> 01:30:09,060
there's a few things I don't like to do.
The thing that everybody's doing,

2134
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:10,500
I immediately,
I'm like,

2135
01:30:10,501 --> 01:30:12,120
wait,
why the fuck is everybody doing that?

2136
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:13,620
That,
that's gotta be weird.

2137
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:14,543
Okay.
So when people sort of drinking in high 

2138
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:17,850
school and Shit,
I'm like,

2139
01:30:17,851 --> 01:30:20,010
why is everybody doing this?
I'm going to take a beat.

2140
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:22,350
Maybe I'll fucking do it later.
Okay.

2141
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:24,210
So there was that.
Then there was also,

2142
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:28,740
when I used to watch like the old Batman
shows with Adam West and shit,

2143
01:30:28,741 --> 01:30:31,110
when he would like penguin and joker 
would gas people,

2144
01:30:31,111 --> 01:30:31,944
that would scare the shit out of me.
So I would equate like being drunk to 

2145
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:38,250
another altered state of mind to where 
like,

2146
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:39,720
like laughing gas was.

2147
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:42,540
So as a kid I was also a little bit 
scared of it.

2148
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:43,673
After that I grew up and I have a thing 
where I don't ever do anything until I 

2149
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:49,254
regret that I haven't done it,
which means I didn't lose my virginity 

2150
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:55,560
until I thought,
oh,

2151
01:30:55,561 --> 01:30:57,780
I should have had sex that one time and 
I missed out.

2152
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:59,093
Right.
Cause then I know I actually want to do 

2153
01:30:59,911 --> 01:31:01,510
it.
Um,

2154
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,890
and same goes with drinking and drugs 
and I just have never felt like I missed

2155
01:31:04,891 --> 01:31:05,910
out.
You don't feel compelled.

2156
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,500
I never,
ever was curious about it.

2157
01:31:07,501 --> 01:31:09,060
I never felt like,
oh man,

2158
01:31:09,061 --> 01:31:09,894
everyone was high.
I should have done it to the other 

2159
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:11,480
night.
Really.

2160
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,230
And when I do feel that way,
I will do it.

2161
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:15,840
I just,
I'm not saying I'll never do it.

2162
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:19,650
It's impressive as fuck that you have 
never even had a beer.

2163
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:20,663
I mean that's,
it's weird.

2164
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,540
I mean it's good for you.
That shit is,

2165
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:24,150
it's healthy.
It's all boys.

2166
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:26,340
And I know I have an addictive 
personality for sure.

2167
01:31:26,341 --> 01:31:27,950
Now being older.
So,

2168
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,080
yeah.
What are you well,

2169
01:31:30,081 --> 01:31:30,900
okay,
uh,

2170
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:33,590
working out,
like that's a good one.

2171
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:34,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

2172
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:35,910
But I mean,
standup comedy,

2173
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:36,510
Dude.
I,

2174
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:37,440
I,
I mean,

2175
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,630
you know,
and it's about jasmine good things.

2176
01:31:39,631 --> 01:31:40,464
I don't know if you can call it 
addiction has like a negative 

2177
01:31:42,061 --> 01:31:42,561
connotation.
No,

2178
01:31:42,561 --> 01:31:42,780
no,
no.

2179
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:45,510
But like the obsessive nature of it and 
there's like,

2180
01:31:45,511 --> 01:31:47,100
I want to,
I worked out today.

2181
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:48,030
I could go ugly.
Do you have any,

2182
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:48,893
do you have like,
okay,

2183
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:50,400
vices?
What's the vice?

2184
01:31:50,401 --> 01:31:50,971
I mean,
come on.

2185
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:51,804
Your addictive personality.
I mean I drink so much fucking calm on 

2186
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:55,470
the due date.
That's good for you.

2187
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:58,510
Maybe not as much as I can.
First Nate and Garth Brooks,

2188
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,770
that's what I do frequently is you 
telling me you never did that at least a

2189
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:05,380
hundred times before you filmed that a 
hundred times.

2190
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:08,740
I really like that.
I really like that.

2191
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:13,030
That's cool.
I don't have a problem with drugs,

2192
01:32:13,031 --> 01:32:13,864
but usually when I do them I regret it 
really just because you feel shitty the 

2193
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:20,220
next day and you're like know more 
hours.

2194
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:21,790
The other thing,
it's fun though.

2195
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:22,624
Some of my best experiences,
some the his times I've had brought 

2196
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:25,810
drugs,
but here's the other thing though,

2197
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,720
I feel shitty in the morning a lot 
anyway.

2198
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:30,970
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2199
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,740
Like you know when you wake up and 
you're like,

2200
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:34,210
oh,
what did I do last night?

2201
01:32:34,211 --> 01:32:35,130
And you're like,
no,

2202
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:37,060
nothing.
You're like,

2203
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:40,150
Oh then why am I in pain and why do I 
have to shit?

2204
01:32:40,151 --> 01:32:40,984
So at least you have an excuse when you 
drink and you exercise and you still 

2205
01:32:43,451 --> 01:32:44,330
wake up like that.
You know,

2206
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:46,690
once I started doing,
like the past year,

2207
01:32:46,691 --> 01:32:50,650
I've been exercising really a lot cause 
I wake up like that and I don't exercise

2208
01:32:50,651 --> 01:32:51,340
how everyone was.

2209
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:53,030
It's a lot better when you've helped 
ours.

2210
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:54,760
It's a beard.
I'll tell you what,

2211
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:55,661
I'm,
I'm almost there.

2212
01:32:55,661 --> 01:32:58,270
I've been thinking about starting an 
exercise for at least three years.

2213
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:00,820
Well,
in the next eight,

2214
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,980
nine,
10 years when you should give it a shot.

2215
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:06,070
When I had my first heart attack,
you'll think back now.

2216
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,020
You'll be old.
You'll be 40.

2217
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:13,110
Yeah,
I mean I basically will be in silence at

2218
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:15,070
that exercise,
dude.

2219
01:33:15,071 --> 01:33:16,800
Now I do like a,
um,

2220
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:19,510
like a circuit training.
Like,

2221
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:20,231
I just like,
I'll,

2222
01:33:20,231 --> 01:33:22,240
I'll do like,
like I'll run,

2223
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:25,480
I'll do sprints and then I'll lift the 
little weights.

2224
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:28,440
A lot of body resistance stuff.
And you have a trainer?

2225
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,800
I have had a trainer,
but you know,

2226
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:34,900
I kind of adopted my own shit.
Now you learn some of his stuff and then

2227
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:36,070
you know,
a lot.

2228
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:37,450
I also,
and I like doing it,

2229
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,820
um,
and uh,

2230
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:41,220
you know,
I like to sweat and I liked her.

2231
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:43,870
I like to spend an hour not checking my 
phone,

2232
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:45,400
otherwise they'll just,
you know what I mean?

2233
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:46,990
Um,
so yeah.

2234
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:49,340
Hmm.
Plus I wish I liked it,

2235
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:50,533
but,
but you don't like it until you get 

2236
01:33:52,301 --> 01:33:54,640
quoted.
How long did it take you until you liked

2237
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:56,950
it and how was it grueling up until that
point?

2238
01:33:57,910 --> 01:34:00,550
It's a fucking hard in the beginning of 
man also.

2239
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,473
Have you,
have you ever been in a guy who 

2240
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:05,950
exercises?
I've gone probably at most,

2241
01:34:05,951 --> 01:34:08,030
maybe like six months of being like 
real.

2242
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:08,993
Okay.
So wouldn't know I was there because if 

2243
01:34:10,841 --> 01:34:11,674
you've never done it,
it's like really fucking hard thing I 

2244
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:15,870
did was swim.
Oh,

2245
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:17,370
that's hard.
Yeah.

2246
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:18,580
Yeah.
It's,

2247
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:20,680
um,
I don't know man.

2248
01:34:20,681 --> 01:34:25,660
I just like it.
I like to sweat and exhaust myself,

2249
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:27,520
see if I could do more the next time,
you know?

2250
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:28,413
Well,
being healthy and looking good is 

2251
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:31,810
fucking yes.
That also,

2252
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:34,210
and also it's like if I'm going to be on
camera,

2253
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:35,044
it's my job.
I tell myself that too as I eat a 

2254
01:34:37,751 --> 01:34:40,810
hamburger every fucking time.
Farc hamburgers are the best.

2255
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:41,913
Do you have a problem with food?
Like do you like now that you're 

2256
01:34:44,741 --> 01:34:46,030
exercising a lot,
his diet,

2257
01:34:46,031 --> 01:34:47,320
something you think about?
I do.

2258
01:34:47,321 --> 01:34:48,250
Yeah.
Um,

2259
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:49,780
I,
I,

2260
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:50,673
I'm basically like really good all day 
and then at night is like where I'm 

2261
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:56,860
like,
you let it go.

2262
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:57,950
I love it.
That's great.

2263
01:34:57,950 --> 01:34:58,150
And,

2264
01:34:58,150 --> 01:34:59,000
and I,
and I try to,

2265
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,800
I try to forgive,
forgive myself about it.

2266
01:35:00,801 --> 01:35:03,590
I try to not like be like,
cause I don't want to beat some as look,

2267
01:35:03,591 --> 01:35:04,640
here's what,
here's what I don't want to be.

2268
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:06,640
If you guys get a pizza,
I don't want to be the guy.

2269
01:35:06,641 --> 01:35:07,474
I was like,
Nah,

2270
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:09,410
can have a slice dude.
Your national,

2271
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:12,500
if you're like that you can get a pizza 
you to fucking part of the pizza,

2272
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:14,180
you know,
so,

2273
01:35:14,181 --> 01:35:15,470
uh,
you know,

2274
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:18,140
you is your slice skipper.
No,

2275
01:35:18,141 --> 01:35:22,070
I agree with like the don't be such an 
extreme to like ruin a party.

2276
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:22,933
Exactly.
Yeah.

2277
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:24,600
Okay.
Yeah.

2278
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:26,690
Yeah.
The vegetarian theory of like,

2279
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:29,930
I won't fucking touch it.
I was like,

2280
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:32,193
and when my brother went vegetarian,
if my mom's still cooked something in 

2281
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:37,820
the pot,
which he can,

2282
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:40,950
but let's say there's beans,
it wouldn't touch the beans,

2283
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:41,571
but it's like,
okay,

2284
01:35:41,571 --> 01:35:45,050
so you're asking her now to cook a whole
either that becomes a problem.

2285
01:35:45,051 --> 01:35:46,070
It's like,
Oh shit,

2286
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,420
goddammit.
Fuck.

2287
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,200
So that's when I'm like,
well,

2288
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:52,220
just I wish you,
and they compromise.

2289
01:35:52,221 --> 01:35:53,630
That's all.
I wish you enabled me more.

2290
01:35:54,260 --> 01:35:55,410
Is that too much to ask you?
Yeah,

2291
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:56,990
no,
it's not.

2292
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:57,741
Maybe,
I don't know.

2293
01:35:57,741 --> 01:35:59,240
You guys just,
was she,

2294
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:00,250
um,
was she enabled me more.

2295
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:03,640
We just ate a breakfast burrito and 
today it's not enough.

2296
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:10,780
So we're getting,
we're about to wrap.

2297
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:11,673
Okay.
But I have a couple of things I want to 

2298
01:36:12,561 --> 01:36:13,394
ask you first,
which is kind of become a thing with 

2299
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:16,670
our,
with our show here.

2300
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,073
So this is something that we happen to 
talk a lot about and I find it 

2301
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:21,524
fascinating because it's so private and 
everyone has their own different 

2302
01:36:23,571 --> 01:36:26,810
approach.
How do you wipe your ass?

2303
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,920
How do you mean up to you?
You have a bad day,

2304
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:31,873
but you're asking me about a lot of 
stuff that I already have severe 

2305
01:36:33,711 --> 01:36:35,440
opinions about and the script,
I liked it.

2306
01:36:35,441 --> 01:36:40,350
So it's like I prepare it well.
Why do you wipe,

2307
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:41,360
first of all,
how do you do it?

2308
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,223
Look at all the way that I do it is I,
I love baby wipes changed my fucking 

2309
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:49,790
life because you go dry drives a whole 
mess.

2310
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:50,660
It's just not feasible.

2311
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:51,740
It's not,
it doesn't cut it.

2312
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:53,720
You tried to clean,
you know,

2313
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:54,793
it's like sandpaper.
You ever believe from your asshole from 

2314
01:36:57,141 --> 01:36:58,100
wiping too much?
Yes.

2315
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,960
Isn't that the fucking worse?
You see?

2316
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:01,820
Yeah,
it's bad.

2317
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:02,780
It's bad.
Baby Wipe.

2318
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:07,130
You go and dry.
You end what you call it a fucking day.

2319
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,353
Now.
There's been a whole debate about our 

2320
01:37:08,991 --> 01:37:10,700
baby wipes cause that flushable babe 
webs.

2321
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:11,593
Are they actually flushable that's a 
debate we have a lot of people say it's 

2322
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:17,990
destroying sewage systems.
Okay,

2323
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:19,573
so at then there's a,
there's also a debate because I want a 

2324
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,700
thorough answer from you.
You go from the front.

2325
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,490
Do you go from the back back?
See I,

2326
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:30,560
I'm an unusual breed.
I go from the front.

2327
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:33,120
A lot of people they reject.
I never knew it.

2328
01:37:33,121 --> 01:37:37,330
Probably the guy that did that.
So like that's what I know.

2329
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:38,900
I lift the balls.

2330
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:39,261
Yeah,
I know.

2331
01:37:39,261 --> 01:37:42,110
But you bring it closer to your bowl.
My balls are not that.

2332
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:42,973
Well you lift it up.
You don't like at most I'll go like at 

2333
01:37:45,561 --> 01:37:50,210
most I'll go like halfway up the chode 
it since like so much more uncomfortable

2334
01:37:50,211 --> 01:37:53,990
just to be back.
I don't get this,

2335
01:37:57,110 --> 01:37:59,250
but it's like,
are you sitting or are you standing?

2336
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:03,270
You fucking go under the boss.
Yeah.

2337
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:07,860
Imagine what you look like.
People generally aren't watching me.

2338
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:09,370
Imagine how you look like,
like this.

2339
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:11,680
This isn't a good sexy.
I'm pretty like,

2340
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,210
and I do it when you go,
Ooh,

2341
01:38:16,211 --> 01:38:17,990
it sounds nice,
but you could also go here.

2342
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:24,360
But I'm just saying a lot.
I get a lot of pushback on that.

2343
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:28,930
But I think I liked that you,
I own it.

2344
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:33,620
I own it because you lift,
you cut the balls and the thing is like,

2345
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:37,410
you can be quite comfortable at the 
toilet with your hand.

2346
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,890
Don't you get about this?
Doesn't your arm touching?

2347
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:42,641
Yeah it is.
No,

2348
01:38:42,641 --> 01:38:47,140
you just raise up a little bit more.
But what I don't get is if you don't get

2349
01:38:47,141 --> 01:38:49,000
it all,
you're pushing shit.

2350
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:50,103
God,
this is gross.

2351
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:52,390
Pushing Shit closer to your Dick.

2352
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:54,780
What is that like?
What?

2353
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:57,700
The whole thing is just about how close 
this shit to my debt.

2354
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:59,510
I mean it does.
It does.

2355
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:04,460
It does.
It doesn't mean it's on my desk,

2356
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:05,983
but also I'm not,
it's not so much that you're bringing 

2357
01:39:07,641 --> 01:39:08,570
shit closer.
I mean,

2358
01:39:08,571 --> 01:39:09,404
you're cleaning out your asshole.
Are you bringing shit close to your 

2359
01:39:11,150 --> 01:39:13,650
head,
man?

2360
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:17,570
Like difference.
You're completing your ass.

2361
01:39:18,650 --> 01:39:19,790
Okay,
so all right.

2362
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:22,330
Alright.
So I,

2363
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:24,370
first of all,
I'll tell you right up,

2364
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:27,040
right straight up,
fuck baby wipes.

2365
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:29,170
I,
I don't like baby wipes.

2366
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:33,010
And then with a wet ass hole,
dude,

2367
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:34,750
it,
it's moist.

2368
01:39:34,751 --> 01:39:35,860
It's not white.
It's very white.

2369
01:39:35,861 --> 01:39:36,694
So here's the deal.
I had a fissure or whatever once years 

2370
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:40,990
ago.
Yeah.

2371
01:39:40,990 --> 01:39:42,100
Which is just like,
you know,

2372
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:45,180
that's why you bleed out of your buck.
That's just a cut on your ass.

2373
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:48,910
Cause you're sounds like you're at your 
real laughs.

2374
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:49,151
No,
no,

2375
01:39:49,151 --> 01:39:49,970
no.
That's different.

2376
01:39:49,970 --> 01:39:52,280
That's not that you bro lapsed didn't do
that guy.

2377
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,750
But um,
but so the doctor was like,

2378
01:39:55,751 --> 01:39:58,120
try just use baby wipes from the intro 
heal quicker.

2379
01:39:58,380 --> 01:39:58,990
It was like,
okay,

2380
01:39:58,990 --> 01:40:02,380
so I use baby wipes and then I was in an
apartment complex at this time.

2381
01:40:02,381 --> 01:40:05,590
Am I told it would get so fucking clock 
and I'd go down and I'd be like,

2382
01:40:05,591 --> 01:40:06,640
hey guys,
my toilet's clogged.

2383
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:07,600
And they were like,
oh,

2384
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,940
we're using flushables.
I don't mean,

2385
01:40:09,941 --> 01:40:10,774
I don't know.
Probably not.

2386
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,900
Those will fuck your whole world up.
So,

2387
01:40:12,990 --> 01:40:14,260
and then they were like,
they were like,

2388
01:40:14,261 --> 01:40:17,080
we found that you're using baby wipes.
And they were like,

2389
01:40:17,270 --> 01:40:18,830
you can't use those in this department.
Come back.

2390
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:19,480
And I was like,
no,

2391
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,970
get better toilets like that.
My doctor from,

2392
01:40:21,971 --> 01:40:23,980
we use a shit.
I can get that far.

2393
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:25,173
But you know what date you're supposed 
to do technically throw them in the 

2394
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:31,010
garbage.
You'll have sheer fucking shit man.

2395
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:33,750
So,
so look.

2396
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:36,820
So,
so I don't like,

2397
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:38,290
I don't like baby wipes.
I don't do them.

2398
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:40,150
It feels gross to look after every 
white.

2399
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:42,970
Okay.
So I used to,

2400
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:44,643
and I started taking this thing,
which I guess is psyllium Husk or 

2401
01:40:48,851 --> 01:40:51,120
whatever the fuck or like metamucil 
thing,

2402
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,970
dude,
I do wipe.

2403
01:40:54,971 --> 01:40:56,800
But you don't even have to,
you do,

2404
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:58,600
you can take a wiping supplement.

2405
01:40:58,960 --> 01:40:59,381
No,
no,

2406
01:40:59,381 --> 01:40:59,541
no,
no,

2407
01:40:59,541 --> 01:40:59,711
no,
no,

2408
01:40:59,711 --> 01:41:00,101
no,
no,

2409
01:41:00,101 --> 01:41:00,934
no,
no.

2410
01:41:01,010 --> 01:41:01,690
It's,
it's,

2411
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:02,523
it's,
it's for your bowel movements and it 

2412
01:41:05,651 --> 01:41:08,930
congeals at all.
And metamucil sealant.

2413
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:12,160
This happened at time up at all with 
when you started like exercising?

2414
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:15,040
No,
I basically asked my friend about it.

2415
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:15,671
I was like,
dude,

2416
01:41:15,671 --> 01:41:18,040
I eat burritos and how many times do you
wipe?

2417
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:20,120
And he was like,
two.

2418
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,190
And I was,
wow.

2419
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:23,440
Hey Man,
what do you have?

2420
01:41:23,441 --> 01:41:25,330
An asshole?
And he was like,

2421
01:41:25,331 --> 01:41:26,410
yeah,
take the psyllium husks.

2422
01:41:26,411 --> 01:41:27,190
I was like,
oh,

2423
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:28,920
because I was probably like 30 times.
Okay.

2424
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:30,020
Yeah,
no that's fine.

2425
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:31,451
I'd be like,
yeah,

2426
01:41:31,451 --> 01:41:33,790
I guess I got to finish.
That's how you'll end up with a fisher.

2427
01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:35,190
So,
so I,

2428
01:41:35,191 --> 01:41:36,024
I take this,
did you gotta I wipe once and then I 

2429
01:41:38,111 --> 01:41:38,944
look and I'm like,
do I even have to wipe and I just wipe 

2430
01:41:40,181 --> 01:41:41,530
one other time for good measure dude.

2431
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:44,140
It's like boom.
So you don't need the baby wipe.

2432
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:48,370
You don't need day wipe obviously,
but you don't need the wet one.

2433
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:51,250
No you don't.
And you're shit's just go boop.

2434
01:41:51,251 --> 01:41:52,750
Did you just take the psyllium Husk for 
real?

2435
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,740
That's crazy.
So let me ask you,

2436
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:59,730
I know you started taking it and how 
long after you started taking you duties

2437
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:05,220
and ever since then yes.
It changes your life.

2438
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:07,610
I'll see.
I'll,

2439
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:08,800
I'll show you what I take.
I'll tell.

2440
01:42:08,801 --> 01:42:12,670
I'll send it to you.
That why is that not that revolutionary?

2441
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:14,860
I don't know.
Helium Husk?

2442
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:17,830
Yup.
You see how much you see?

2443
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:18,491
You're like,
oh,

2444
01:42:18,491 --> 01:42:19,324
this is a weird conversation to have,
but this is where you learned the most 

2445
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:24,190
about life.
I mean,

2446
01:42:24,191 --> 01:42:26,670
it helps you more than fucking what are 
you going to do?

2447
01:42:26,690 --> 01:42:27,491
What are you going to do?
You know,

2448
01:42:27,491 --> 01:42:28,390
people are like,
ah,

2449
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:31,750
you know,
motivation policies in the world.

2450
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:33,760
You can,
you can change your bowel movement.

2451
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:37,540
Right.
That's within our grasp as of now.

2452
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:40,630
And literally,
um,

2453
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:43,030
I wipe a lot.
It takes a lot.

2454
01:42:43,090 --> 01:42:45,010
It doesn't,
if you take psyllium husk dude,

2455
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:48,820
even if you eat awful,
yeah bro,

2456
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:50,710
I would have to,
that's fun.

2457
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:53,230
Crazy.
35 times what I could wipe.

2458
01:42:53,231 --> 01:42:55,390
I just keep wiping his shit was like,
well,

2459
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:57,970
didn't now do you go in deep because you
can,

2460
01:42:57,971 --> 01:43:00,640
there's different levels of clean.
Like some people are happy,

2461
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:03,520
they go surface.
They do like a wax on wax off.

2462
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:04,710
I clean,
I clean,

2463
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:05,913
I clean.
I'm not going to walk around with 

2464
01:43:06,521 --> 01:43:07,770
anything.
I bake.

2465
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:12,760
I basically finger my asshole.
It sounds unnecessary.

2466
01:43:13,450 --> 01:43:15,430
I don't,
I don't fuck around.

2467
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:19,790
I don't fuck around either man.
That's why I took that.

2468
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:21,740
That's where I take a supplement for it.
Yeah.

2469
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:23,230
Well,
I'm on that.

2470
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:24,663
I'm going to check that out and I didn't
get a picture of what this dialogue is 

2471
01:43:26,381 --> 01:43:30,070
really genuine because Tom,
we had on recently and he was like,

2472
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:31,473
the big day changed my life and the day 
I don't care cause you're squirting 

2473
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:34,774
water at your ass while I've got an area
asshole that makes everything worse for 

2474
01:43:37,151 --> 01:43:37,601
me.
Yeah,

2475
01:43:37,601 --> 01:43:39,460
I would think so.
The baby wipes too wet.

2476
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:43,750
I mean you're scoring boy the water.
So he was showing us this luxury be day,

2477
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:44,903
we'd like a dryer to the to rise your 
fucking ass hole blows hot air at your 

2478
01:43:50,171 --> 01:43:52,040
ass.
I mean I guess it's better

2479
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,873
than using a hairdryer.
You better hope you got all this shit 

2480
01:43:55,030 --> 01:43:56,960
blowing hot air out of it or like this 
live.

2481
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:59,720
That's how I end every shit.
Yeah.

2482
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:01,341
Alright.
That was good.

2483
01:44:01,341 --> 01:44:03,350
That was fruitful.
What was that called to give me the name

2484
01:44:03,351 --> 01:44:04,220
of that.
She'll be mark.

2485
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:06,800
I wonder if we should make our own 
brand.

2486
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:11,570
My face on it.
I'll give you a percentage.

2487
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:14,150
Psyllium Husk,
which is important.

2488
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:17,440
Let me bold and Italicize this.
Okay.

2489
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:20,840
I'm underline it as well.
Mine's metamucil and it's orange.

2490
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:22,940
It's like an orange container that I 
use.

2491
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,050
Psyllium husk.
Here,

2492
01:44:24,051 --> 01:44:27,890
let me pull it up because I think people
here actually have a lot to benefit from

2493
01:44:27,891 --> 01:44:31,460
this.
Some of you guys will use it because I'm

2494
01:44:31,461 --> 01:44:32,294
talking about it on the podcast and 
you'll fucking think about me every 

2495
01:44:34,671 --> 01:44:36,860
time.
Tickets shit go man.

2496
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:39,650
Whenever works.
This is it.

2497
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:41,990
Apparently it's like a grain or some 
shit.

2498
01:44:41,991 --> 01:44:43,910
He had to go.
So whatever it is,

2499
01:44:43,911 --> 01:44:45,560
it fucking works great.
And the asshole,

2500
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:49,040
can I just eat this?
I don't know.

2501
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,370
I actually don't know.
Is it just fiber?

2502
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:54,200
Fiber?
Well,

2503
01:44:54,201 --> 01:44:55,970
I don't know if that is but,
but the,

2504
01:44:56,030 --> 01:44:57,020
but the,
the,

2505
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:59,780
the thing that I take is not,
I mean,

2506
01:44:59,781 --> 01:45:00,441
maybe there's,
you know,

2507
01:45:00,441 --> 01:45:01,790
I'm sure there's stuff in it and that's 
like that,

2508
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:05,060
but all I know is it fucking works dude.
All right,

2509
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,460
I'm on it.
If it works for me,

2510
01:45:07,461 --> 01:45:09,080
then it works for anyone.
Let me put it that way.

2511
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:10,700
That's what I thought.
And I was like,

2512
01:45:10,701 --> 01:45:11,440
all right,
we'll see.

2513
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,160
And it worked.
The lem husk man,

2514
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:15,060
I want to snort that shit.
Yeah.

2515
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:17,390
Would that help?
I think it would.

2516
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:18,253
Yeah.
Anything kind of helped me like get it 

2517
01:45:19,011 --> 01:45:19,680
in there anyway.

2518
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:20,513
We're in all your years.
Orfices so here's our last question and 

2519
01:45:23,021 --> 01:45:24,380
this one we've been doing for a long 
time.

2520
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:25,303
Okay.
If you don't have a response that's 

2521
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:27,920
perfectly fine.
I don't either.

2522
01:45:27,921 --> 01:45:29,510
But somehow you just never know what to 
expect.

2523
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:30,373
Okay.
Do you have any ghost stories or 

2524
01:45:31,371 --> 01:45:33,980
paranormal experiences in your life?
No,

2525
01:45:33,981 --> 01:45:37,580
I dying neither and I don't either.
And I just don't,

2526
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:39,410
I don't be have Bobby Leon.
Right.

2527
01:45:39,411 --> 01:45:40,910
He's got like a million of them.
Yeah.

2528
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:42,630
But why?
Why has it happened to him and it,

2529
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:44,150
I'm going to be once.
That's what I know.

2530
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:44,993
Oh,
all man.

2531
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:46,670
People don't,
yeah,

2532
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:48,950
I want to believe that.
You know,

2533
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:51,380
I'm open to it.
Sure.

2534
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,270
Yeah.
A one time,

2535
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,860
one time I was,
I had a,

2536
01:45:54,861 --> 01:45:58,020
we,
when we went to fucking cute asphalt,

2537
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:00,530
I went when,
one time I went to,

2538
01:46:00,531 --> 01:46:01,620
uh,
we had like a,

2539
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:03,700
like not like we were my buddies 
backyard.

2540
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:05,050
We went to go sleep outside the 
backyard.

2541
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:07,790
We took a tent out there,
went into the wooded area,

2542
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:11,240
and in the middle of the night we were 
laughing in the middle of the night,

2543
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:14,120
somebody,
we heard an old lady's voice and she was

2544
01:46:14,121 --> 01:46:16,400
like,
could you guys keep it down?

2545
01:46:16,401 --> 01:46:17,930
We're trying to sleep.
And we were like,

2546
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:21,050
how the fuck?
Where did she come from?

2547
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:22,573
It's his backyard.
We don't know who it was that it 

2548
01:46:26,671 --> 01:46:28,790
definitely happened,
but it was a person,

2549
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:31,490
like he was just a weird thing that 
happened,

2550
01:46:31,491 --> 01:46:33,080
but we were scared the shit out of us.
Man.

2551

2570
01:47:22,081 --> 01:47:26,230

spreading baby ship in the world and 

2572

Show what the consent of Daddy Chris 

2573
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:39,810
Delea this person hence forth carries 
the status of elder.

2574
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:40,673
Yeah.
And there's your pin there to prove it 

2575

And there's a little pacifier that says 

2581
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:57,990
elder,

2582
