Halloween, uh, how was your Halloween, Neela? Very boring. Yeah. We didn't even have one person knocking on the door. Not One. What happened to Halloween when I was a kid. It was like a block party. I was telling Isla I walk. I see kids these days with little pumpkin buckets. That's cute. I used to walk around with a fricken pillow case because I was out. Candy. What is currency at that age? Are you kidding me? That's like getting once for the Strip joint. No, I could imagine because in Israel we don't do it, so I don't, I've never experienced it. I loved candy. Well you had a little taste of it because, um, we were walking down the street. There is nobody there. The Sun is like set. It's a beautiful. People have decorated, you know, and there's one some kid

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       and, and, and I'm like, dude, we only saw one kid, super long suburban block, just one kid and two parents. And I was like, that's just, that's so crappy. What's going on? That is bizarre. Just one poor kid. I was like, I'd be embarrassed about that kid. Where's everybody? Um, but anyway, there was, you know, how people, when they're not there, they bring, they have a little bucket that says, only take one. So me and Isla, we're walking our dog and somebody was kind enough to put out one of these buckets and we took one and it was a joy. I have to tell you what the joy wasn't an enjoy. What Kennedy did you get you a gummy bears, gummy bears. I got the uh, milk duds. That's, that was always my favorite. The milk duds, uh, as starburst person, but as I, as I get older and I eat milk duds, I realize not good.

Speaker 4:          00:03:52       I liked the flavor, but it's such a Schlep to put those down is the Carmel just gets everywhere. Damn. As a kid, you don't give a fuck that you eat those like aspirin. When I was a kid, reese's cups that, that was like the Bitcoin, the one candy there would always be like, you get this huge pillowcase and then over the course of a month you would have like whatever, eat everything, have little kitty diabetes, and then all this shitty candies would be left that you don't like. So the ones that I, there were always left for me where I'm nerds hate nerds. Oh Dude. I hate nerds. They're these sour little pebbles hate nerds. They're so lame compared to a male judge. But that's what I'm saying. Yeah, you would, you would broke, you would broker the shitty candy with other people. Be like, you want some nerds?

Speaker 4:          00:04:45       And they'd be like, you want milk duds? And I'm like, no, this is, this is like a little less than in world trade. You know what I mean? It was a beautiful thing. So the suckers like these little shitty suckers you get in doctor's office, like give me a break. There's cock suckers in this planet that are giving out. Like I remember someone giving up pennies, pennies, pennies, and I remember people can and got like fruit and I'm like, oh, cool for you dude. You're doing a little protest against candy on Halloween. You get a fucking life on another day. Yeah. But I love Halloween and sadly, I don't know. In La you just have to know where to go. I don't know. I guess our neighborhood was literally empty. Yeah, last night at the same thing. Not even an exaggeration. It was actually empty. But I hope you all had a wonderful blessing.

Speaker 4:          00:05:40       Halloween full of spooks and streets. I've got some great halloween footage. Just share with you guys at the top of this beautiful Friday afternoon. Uh, I just remembered I did want to give a shredder or update. A lot of people still think that it's poop. Oh No, no, no, no, just because I say it sometimes I just want to say stop doing that. He's a good boy. Now. He's a sweet angel. He's a big boy. He doesn't need this. I don't want to misrepresent shredder. No, he's not a shitty leader. He hasn't eaten shit and I know he doesn't do it anymore. One day he was like, Hey, you know what, I'm going to stop eating shit. And wasn't that a great day for all of us? Because sometimes he come and lick you right in the mouth and you'd be like, dude, dude, cute. And also I can taste shit.

Speaker 4:          00:06:29       You just eat shit. Like threw in the towel, but I love you. Anyway. That's kind of what parenthood is, right? Probably you just shut my mouth and I love you. So we spoke about these gracious people that leave the buckets of candy in the front yard that says only take one, but as you may or may not know as Halloween is new to you, there's always some piece of crap that dumps the whole fricken bucket out into their pillow case and it just, it's not right. It's not right, but here now I've got some clips of my favorite that I've found of this year. These are all fresh of parents getting in on the good spirit.

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       Halloween, no isla take. We are about to have a kid, so notice on the good parenting. Now I want to feel. I want to point something out. This sweetheart. Take one.

Speaker 4:          00:07:20       Exactly. The kid has a sweet, pure heart. He reads the sign and he says, I'll only take one. I'm a sweet, pure soul, but life. This is what happens when life gets to you. You become this lady and here's why.

Speaker 3:          00:07:38       One Hand not, not only for the bucket full can be. What is he going to deal with it?

Speaker 4:          00:07:53       She's scooping it like it's her life. Depends on it. And she got the poor kid like that's the example that he has to follow. I know it breaks my heart because he was a sweet kid. It's like it's just candy lady. What is, what is he saying? Like, no, at the end there. Let's see. I'm curious. He's like, Mommy, Halloween

Speaker 3:          00:08:18       sacred.

Speaker 4:          00:08:24       The kid is saying, mommy, come on. Oh man, that breaks my heart.

Speaker 3:          00:08:30       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:08:32       I said, mommy, come on. You can only take one. Good. What a sweet soul. What do you mean? What's the, is still candy. It's insulin. You know what I mean? Uh, what are they, you know, this kid, this kid is not, doesn't have a good shot of coming up. Right? But he has pure heart and I love that forum. When your eight year old has a better moral compass thing. Also don't people under like I always see videos of people stealing packages from front doors. It's like, you know, that everybody has like, ring now we're all watching them. People didn't catch up yet. Yeah, we're watching. Um, so there you go. You know, stealing it like her life depends on it. I saw one comment on the video that said, what are the chances that kid sees any of it? That candy? Yeah. I'm wondering too, because is it for her? Why would she care about that? And just buy a candy. You can get so much candy for like $1 at Ralph's. Yeah. Also the sales the next day are freaking nuts. So here's a family that ran sensible little a pick me up on this Friday afternoon, ring.com monster. Yes sir.

Speaker 5:          00:09:59       Okay man, this is a few years later. The kids got used to it,

Speaker 4:          00:10:17       but it's like, Yo, it's not a riot. There's flooding. There's not a Zombie apocalypse. Some fucking snuck one in the house. Look there.

Speaker 5:          00:10:26       Well, gender,

Speaker 4:          00:10:28       that's like, come on, let's go. You don't rob people on any other day. That's what you're doing. You're robbing. You don't go feel shit. What happened? They left the little girl and she's, they opened the door. They left the little girl. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:10:47       Ooh,

Speaker 4:          00:10:49       I missed that. Great parents take note because we have a lot to learn about parenting. I can't wait to ransacks. And uh, and then finally, um, the theme of Halloween, this one is old.

Speaker 6:          00:11:06       Do you sometimes wish that April theme of,

Speaker 4:          00:11:09       you know, dressing up in a costume. These guys were promoting a musical and Ninja turtles musical and they started talking about wanting to bang April and there's like all these kids there who are like turtles, mega fans that I was just blown away by this clip. It's a y and incredible thing

Speaker 6:          00:11:30       was the turtle. Actually. That works for me, but April was a turtle. Do you wish April? Actually, that works for me so far. I've been trying to talk her into an inter species relationships for months. She do it. No, she can't hold her breath long enough. You know, want to run

Speaker 4:          00:12:01       sprain on April. That's not Canon. That is not part of the Ninja Turtles. Laura. Hey, April. You want to ride? You want to have an interspecies relationship with all four of us. Too Bad. You can't hold her breath long enough. I'm going to drown her in ges. Well, because the turtles aren't in water. You know they walk around the earth. Did they mean that they think she says they can't hold her breath long enough? I assume he means because turtles are water creatures. I've gotten beaming because they think. Why would that? Why would she need to be underwater? Because they stink. No, they'll hold her breath. Oh, I don't necessarily understand the application, but it doesn't seem right either way. You can't hold her breath long enough, I assume because they're drowning or in com. So a bunch of fucking heavy sectoral here. You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          00:12:57       Look at that. Look at this. Look at this.

Speaker 4:          00:13:01       Kids on the left. He is traumatized. I love that black sweater with the two. Yeah, that was pretty bad. Uh, I love that. As far as good at this poor kid on the left, man. He, that no kid should see. Hey, because you know, every kid has a kind of a crush on April because she's kind of a hot cartoon character and he probably wants to fuck April and now all of a sudden he's got to imagine his turtle friends blocking him. Yeah. He's ahead of his time. He's like, this is a me too. Me Too moment. Donna Tello. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:13:38       Panels are going to perform their hit. Did you want to change? I love to. The kids

Speaker 4:          00:13:50       cut to the kids dramatize. It looks like an adult just like, Damn Donna Tello.

Speaker 6:          00:13:59       Did you want me to say something? I'll see you after to say that being in a report type for me not to analyze, and a good thing about these guys

Speaker 4:          00:14:11       is that they're huge turtle Cox. They might be turtles, but they're hung like a horse, so there you go. Happy Halloween. Everybody. I'm feeling better by the way. Thank you for asking. Still have a cough that is just brutal, but let's talk about Isla. Who's pregnant? [inaudible]. How are you feeling? I feel okay. No morning sickness. No, you're gaining weight. Gaining weight. I'm not fitting in my pants already. And didn't you? I have to say this. You got fucking bat dog. I have to say it, dude. Why do you say daddy's got fucking math? That's not good there. All right. We're talking about being pregnant. You know, I'm just. I'm just noticing the changes that are happening to your body. I Guess Daddy. Oh, we got our first ultrasound. We saw the baby. You're thickening up is my point. Like it's. You get. How much weight have you gained since we found out like a five or six pounds. It's pretty amazing. Something that. No, you look. Did you look amazing? I just want to say you look so beautiful. So radiant. You look amazing. You were like, I'm telling you, you're free. Even like to think it's amazing that you're pregnant. Yeah. Yeah. And so we saw, we saw the little pipsqueak because we did an ultrasound and I'm here. I got a video for you. It's such a trip to me.

Speaker 2:          00:15:57       Uh, you can see the heartbeat in this whole fucking bought this little fuck.

Speaker 4:          00:16:01       And the doctor said he looks like a gummy bear. Yeah. He's a little gummy bear.

Speaker 2:          00:16:06       Yeah. He, she, I don't know. But you see the heartbeat right here. Here. Let me pull the screen up

Speaker 4:          00:16:12       thing man. That's inside Ila.

Speaker 2:          00:16:15       That's not crazy. And it's like moving. Yeah, he's swimming around. He's legs are wiggling and shit. So crazy. So this is the head and the body and the arms and legs are starting to form and he's got a little heartbeat.

Speaker 4:          00:16:32       Good to go.

Speaker 2:          00:16:35       That little guy is cooking up in your stomach. It's so weird. How does it feel like that? There's like a license life growing

Speaker 4:          00:16:43       in you and so weird because I don't feel it don't, but like do you know that it's there. It's crazy. It's pretty magical, I guess. I don't know. It's like, yeah, what we're meant to do, but it's so insane. It's interesting how we're so removed from nature in a way that we find like birth to be so magical, but it is magical. Yeah. It's really something. I just fuck it. We just did it. You know what I mean? Now there's a little heartbeat inside of you and are we run the danger of gushing over our kids and nobody cares. I'm already gushing over this little because I saw people. I'm asking for the baby updates. Right? So I guess let us know because I know I hate hearing about other people's kids and I, and I was like, everybody does. And it's like because you don't, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:17:41       That's true. I never understood how special it feels. Yeah. And so I don't know for already running that danger. It's like an ultrasound. It's like I already loved that little gummy bear looking at him. He's dude, his heartbeat is so strong. His heartbeat is so strong. What they say on the DNA test at the super athlete body, a super athlete heartbeat. I'm telling you, he's going to be president someday. I want to wish I wouldn't wish being president on my worst enemy. Talk about the worst job in the world right there it is, man. Isla is doing great too. You are doing great. You get a little tired. Sometimes. I get really tired and I, I get pretty hungry and then eat and then I'm like, then I'm ready to sleep. I'm kind kinda like a baby. Like I'm eating, sleeping. You have a life for sucking your energy out.

Speaker 4:          00:18:41       You have a foreign. You're a host and I do have cravings for people who were wondering if it's true or not. So like all of a sudden I really feel like eating something Mac and cheese this morning or I'll really not feel like eating something. Mexican food. Yeah. It's so weird. It was like, I don't want Mexican food anymore. I'm like, what's up? Usually I love it. It's like all wheat this morning. She's like, Ethan, you need to make mack a treat. Cope, and I did. It's like, Oh, I was walking straight and all of a sudden I'm like Mac and cheese. That's what I did. But the interesting thing is about the cravings is that I wonder if there's really some actual science behind it. We're there is because there was one week where all of a sudden every night I want to add a mommy.

Speaker 4:          00:19:28       I feel aware. Yeah. And so soybean and it's, I think it's really good for you to be so and, and now I'm completely over it. I don't, I can't touch it. Interestingly, that was before we knew you were pregnant, but I was, I dunno, but like you were craving Mac and cheese and I wonder if you needed like calcium and the vitamins and all this dairy and stuff. Some awesome. Even butter and cheese, fat, lots of fat, you know, very cool man. Very exciting stuff. You know, but I have so much appreciation. I really do know that you are raising this child and your stomach and you're going to give birth to this child. I'm really afraid of that guys have to do is not. There's nothing easier in the world and nutting I think I'll be okay until like the fifth month or something.

Speaker 4:          00:20:19       But then things started to get hard. I'm scared. I'm scared of that part. I know you're scared, but I'm excited because I know it's going to be fine and I know you're going to be great and I can't wait to see the transformation and everything and all the changes and like you growing, it's going to be so wild, but I understand you're scared. It is scared. I'd be scared too if it was me, but I know everything's going to be great and I'm looking at like maternity clothes and it's so not my style. It's got to be hip. Oh No. What am I going to wear? I already don't feel my clothes. I wonder if there's any Gucci, maternity pants. We can get you all swagged out. And we started looking at baby stuff. We bought some baby clothes for our friends and they're like so freaking cool and obviously way more affordable than like adult clothes. And I was like, Oh, I understand why you have multiple kids. It's like, I'm not going to let this sit close. Go to waste. I'm having another kid just so I can put them in this dope ass clothes again. You know? But I swear to God, I'm just like, I'm gushing over ela because it's just amazing. I know. It's amazing. I shear so cool. It's amazing. Seriously. Something else, man. So there you go.

Speaker 4:          00:21:39       There's a baby update for you. Let us know. It's too much. You know, if you're over. Stopped with the baby. I get it. He's got a heartbeat. All babies have rp. No, but not all babies have a heartbeat like that one. Did they all look like a gummy bear? No. By the way, that heartbeat is like a sick. I could tell he's got like rhythm and soul too. Like this guy is artistic ash unit is empathetic. Like you're a warrior. Basically. Gandhi mixed with everything out of the best things you can imagine. Boom. Right? They're presented with the opportunity to steal a bunch of candy. He would take one politely. Say, no, Daddy, let's get off this. Now I'm pushing it in too long as the title of the episode indicates, Post Malone is under fire by the media. Now, let me preface this by saying that post Malone has become so popular, so successful this year has been incredible. I read something that he has been the most streamed in the most popular musician of this entire year. He is the biggest musician in the world. Two thousand 18 or maybe the United States, I don't know, but like combined with his first album, his first album. You guys, Baroque Michael Jackson's thriller record for being on like the top 10 billboard for the longest consecutive weeks. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:23:16       Do we have no internet? Oh, I have internet. You know, I think so Dan. I have Internet. Thank God we have a backup system for them. Anyway, so post Malone has been wildly successful and I would say he has critics, but from the fans and the people that consume his music, he always loved you. Always had gotten a lot of shit. Yeah, he's gotten a lot of shit. But the people who give him

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       shit are kind of like the old guards. These, these, you know, but the fans, the consumers, he's beloved because he's such, he's got such a great personality. He's such a chill dude. He, he, you know, he's just a great guy. There's, there's no question about that.

Speaker 4:          00:24:08       Never claimed to want to make anything more than just some good music. Right, exactly. And this article is exactly, that's the problem apparently

Speaker 2:          00:24:20       problem that this Arthur seems to have, and this is in the Washington Post, so this is a big reputable. This was shared with me by a lot of people. So I think a lot of eyeballs fell in this article. The problem he seems to have is that he's not woke enough of some sorts or he sees Postville and success as symptomatic of all of the problems in the world and he makes all these grand comparisons to like conservative movement. It's very political who he makes comparisons to him being like Donald Trump,

Speaker 4:          00:24:50       the factory setting it then info. It's somehow like, now we all need to judge him, right?

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       Um, that he's pro gun or like an Apoc, you know, like a doomsday or whatever you want to call it. It's all, you know, use to paint this picture that he's some sleeper, conservative outright troll I think is kind of somewhat

Speaker 4:          00:25:15       to tone for sure because there's

Speaker 2:          00:25:17       not really any proof to support that. So they kind of try to build this case using things that aren't really direct. Right? So they don't really come out and say it. But um, the thing about Austin that I know is that he's never tried to do or be anything. He's just making music that he likes. Exactly. It's from styles that he likes and everybody is like, if you don't like his music,

Speaker 2:          00:25:48       if you don't like, it's like, I don't know, I just. The thing about this article, like it's, it's interesting and it's worthy of an analysis of who he is and why he's popular now. But it's so mean spirited. It's so mean. Maybe you should read some from the beginning. Well, let me show you. First of all, really pop this open. The video is so obnoxious. Okay. Let's start with this post malone. You think you know, but you have no idea. Also, the title is post Malone is the perfect pop star of this American moment and that's not a compliment. Sounds like one God, that sounds like a nice. I mean, why don't you just say what you want to say that? Yeah. Because she is the author. He or she, Jeff Weiss is trying to make this point of like he's perfect because of Donald trump and everything. And this is why he's. Let's watch this video. Thanks for having me.

Speaker 7:          00:26:44       I, I, I'm just so, uh, you're just so likable and I, I really am interested in your story. You might know post Malone as the soundcloud rapper who went triple platinum for his debut track, White Iverson. You might know him as the genre bending artists combining country. Granted, you know, pop in just about every since

Speaker 4:          00:27:03       also raped babies. No. Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:27:09       Or You may not know him at all, but you should. Malone is huge. For context, his album, stoney beat out Michael Jackson's thriller for most weeks and top 10 on the top RMB dies. That may surprise you.

Speaker 4:          00:27:25       In fact, this talentless a hack actually dethrone Michael Jackson.

Speaker 7:          00:27:34       Do you understand the artists a bit better? Born Austin, Richard Post, he became post malone the same way. Donald Glover became childish Gambino through rap name generator. Malone wasn't always focused on.

Speaker 4:          00:27:44       Absolutely. Music is very eerie and in, in, in, in, in, in anything. It's like crunching the numbers a little fucking spooky, a little. Something's wrong here.

Speaker 7:          00:27:57       He learned how to play guitar by playing guitar hero. I started playing a guitar because I felt cool with the controller, so I says, let me do the real thing in Hollywood. They're part of a heavy metal band. He credits Bob. Dylan is one of his major influences. Executives. Record company. Republic records have described Malone as the Donald Trump of hip hop because quote things that should have killed his career. He only made him bigger.

Speaker 4:          00:28:24       So here they're trying to make an unjustified parallel between him and trump. Things that should have killed them. Only made them. I didn't even know what they're talking about. This was one dude's quo, but they're just even just by being like post Malone, Donald Trump, even though they say it again in another context in the article. So like they're kind of, almost subconsciously in a way being like he is Donald Trump and he supports Donald Trump and you know, they make it like everything's got to be political, but he likes guns. Yeah. It's like if you're a liberal, they say like, if you're a liberal and you believe in resisting Donald Trump, then you should hate post malone. And it's like, no, it's got nothing to do with politics.

Speaker 7:          00:29:10       Twenty 16. He said he considered playing President Donald Trump's inauguration fast. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:29:16       That's pretty much in 2016. Wait, I don't even. I guess you. Yeah. What did he know about trump back then? Like, nope. Yes, but also if a president asked you to play the inauguration and it's few years ago too. He wasn't, by the way, in 2016, his first album hadn't even come out. He wasn't a megastar every word he said wasn't dissected. Did it seem like, uh, somebody asked him. He's like, yeah, I probably did like, Oh, this mother fucker pizza gate, you know, it's like God damn,

Speaker 8:          00:29:56       I didn't vote.

Speaker 4:          00:29:57       Oh, he didn't vote. A No vote is a vote for trump. He's not woke enough. How has that damning? He's fucking also, by the way, this interview took place when it was like 21. He's 23 now.

Speaker 8:          00:30:21       Why political would make it a political standard. Our votes don't count. Malone

Speaker 4:          00:30:26       is a second amendment comment by the way. They're just like, watch this, and then they go into. He likes guns. No, really? Yeah, he likes guns. You guys.

Speaker 9:          00:30:36       Hey.

Speaker 4:          00:30:38       Oh, we got mentioned here. Top comment. Watching this h three video right now. That's when people used to like us. Those were the days a large collection of guns on the personal front. He's friends with Justin Bieber and has even opened for him on tour. Did somebody say Justin Bieber? He's Canadian. Did you know that he. The babies in the ass? No. No, he does not do that. But what? What does that, what does that like what, what? I don't know. Somehow they're turning everything into like having a negative tone even though they're just saying like, did you know that he's physical accomplishment. He opened for Justin Bieber tour. Exactly. Showing him on Jimmy Fallon. Like that's a problem. So you know, that. Did you know that he has tattoos on his face often associated with criminal gangs?

Speaker 8:          00:31:38       Was it true that like Justin Bieber talked you into getting a tattoo? I figured because we were working on stony and then um, we had a tattoo artist come through and then it was just like, you know what, Justin Bieber's got some tats and I love you, but I know I'm way tougher than you.

Speaker 4:          00:31:56       Why would they show that he's kidding? He's obviously kidding. But like what? So what is living cut it off before the laughter of the audience. I just don't understand. So this is the video. This is the kind of preface this toe that sets the tone. It's like, wow,

Speaker 4:          00:32:14       point with this video is entitled. You think you know, but you have no idea. So what did I learn? He likes guns. He didn't vote. He's friends with Justin Bieber. Wow, let's send this guy to prison. Okay, well now let's get on with this. Weird to see such a, like that's a hate base, right? As much as, as much of a hippies as you can make without being like so obvious about it because they constructed a way that people who are sympathetic to them don't see happen. Manipulate too. So we see right through it. Exactly. But it's very normal. Washington pulse, obviously. He's a liberal of liberal leaning paper and I'm like a reputable. Oh Yeah, Washington Post is like on par with New York Times. I mean just one of the most famous newspapers in the world actually owned by your boy, Jeff Bezos by Amazon. But this is the op Ed and this is not like. I don't know, it's probably got a lot of traction. I wonder if has views or anything. But um, you know what? I'm going to read this article. It's time for a break, so do not go away. We're going to dive right into this and mount a defense of our good friend, sweet angel posts Malone on this blessing Friday. See you guys soon.

Get started today. Welcome back everybody to the h, three broadcast. Love. Thank you all for sticking around. Back to the article. I don't understand this. They start off by saying Dallas, him.

Speaker 9:          00:40:29       What does that mean? Him Low

Speaker 2:          00:40:33       regardless. The most popular young artists and the most unpopular young nation is a rhinestone cowboy who looks like he crawled out of the primordial swamp of Nacho cheese. I'll hand that to them. That's pretty funny. But Post Malone well, okay. He's making fun. He says he looks like he's a little sticky. People have said that a lot about them. I can tell you he doesn't stink, but regardless here it goes on. This is when it gets mean. Post Malone is a Halloween rental, a removable platinum grill, cubic zirconium proposal on the jumbo screen of a last place team.

Speaker 2:          00:41:13       I am getting mileage out of that. A English degree right there. No, he's like that. By the way that I mentioned. I went to college, uh, his music, one of the shallowest bastardization of rap to date. And I do not say that lightly type ticket from Mr, which was basically him saying, I hate everybody. White German for white. Literally. Jeff White. Yes, Dan. He's an authority authority on rap, on the rap music. Your last name is a white dude. Mind your own business. Dan said that, not me. I don't care. I don't see race as the creative tension of associates at a down town. Dude, stop with the analogies. Has the creative tension of associates at a downtown law firm complaining that a hundred and $50,000 a year just doesn't cut it? What are you talking about? Just getting to the point.

Speaker 2:          00:42:08       He looks like he clubbed over that. It looks like it was clubbed over the head by a cartoon. Peacock. He just turned 23. So poetic. Alright dude. This guy so bitter. He's so you could, you could taste is better and America just can't get enough. And somehow in that sun insults that. Well, yeah, because in his mind the only reason that America get could like this guy who he who went to college and is so in tune with the hip hop and knows what's good. The only reason the only way that America could, could like him is if the world was just upside down. Enough sense. Kind of like Donald Trump did. We mentioned possibly Nielsen recently named a the suburban Dallas raised rapper 2018 is the most popular musician, so it was only a matter of time before malone had his own festival of contemporary rite of passage for nearly every major pop rap star who has his face plastered across spotifies get turnt playlists. I'm sure he's on other playlists than get turnt. More like most popular songs. How about that one asshole get termed the inauguration. Post-Defense was held Sunday night in Dallas's Dos equis pavilion. Watched it like, oh, and did it have to be on a beer?

Speaker 2:          00:43:31       And it was a less a festival than a behemoth. What is sae a? Do you know what that is? Dan? Rush mixer held on a few acres of corporate branded concrete. Many festivals pride themselves on offering non musical diversity diversion such as art installations or novelty culinary options. That sounds awful. There were none of that here though. Just $5. Jello shots. That's exactly what I want. When I go to a show, a novelty culinary option. I think the essay is a reference to a Frat by the way, so he's just saying like a. it's like a frat party. I think he's confusing a. A concert with a farmer's market. The shot, the concerts that I usually go to remind me of. Calabasas farmer's market.

Speaker 2:          00:44:17       There were a little to separate. There were a little separated from regular postal and concert. Other than that, the big name opening acts and true religion sponsored post Malone Bandanas, featuring an extreme closeup of Austin post itself. Glade squinting as ever. What is wrong with having a festival? That's him plus other big artists. Is that the first festival? You know, it's not that easy to put together the crazy through that together. So I know he was working on it a while. I don't know what he's comparing it to, but maybe in five years they would get crazier. You know, honestly, compared to a Lollapalooza, this thing sucks. There was no novelty. Arts and crafts stations. This should have ostensively been a coordination is unequivocal. Ascension to the a list pops superstardom of mano named visionaries do stop. There are artists who dictate the Zeit geist and those who reflected possible. One is to the ladder, an Avatar of algorithm culture that rewards pleasant banality over the creative leap. Vexing. I need to. Oh, when I'm listening to music, I want to be vexed. I want to be confused, or it's like you're trying to figure it out. It's. I mean, this guy needs to be thinking all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:45:39       Sorry about my cough. Guys. I'm still getting over this illness and his own festival in his hometown. He had the opportunity to lucidly stayed his mission and values. Instead, he revealed himself to be Jack Johnson of the Ada weights and nakedly grafted hip hop. So I love that. He's like running for office. Okay guys, here's what I believe I read. He's like, he didn't reject trump. And tell everybody to vote, you know what I mean? That's kind of what he's saying. Right. He had the opportunity to state his mission and values. Like I feel like that's what he's saying. He's like, unlike Jay Z and beyonce who say they hate trump and urge everyone to vote. He didn't actually want to say that, but that you know what the thing is. That is kind of why he's popping and I'll tell you why because young kids, they may already have their mind up and then maybe politically motivated, but this article is part of the problem in that it politicizes everything.

Speaker 2:          00:46:37       And Post Malone is decidedly unpolitical. He said even two years ago, he doesn't vote and he's a young guy. Okay. First of all, but like you, it's nice. It is nice to separate politics from some fucking thing because it's literally everywhere. You know what I mean? You don't need to be preached to all the effing time and is doing it as a decision. That's what he, that's what he wants and like it because he's trying to have fun because the point is that he's trying to have fun and that's his personality. When you hung out with him and you know you don't have a political conversation. Well this is just. Yeah, but Isla, you basically today, right now on this live podcast, have the opportunity to lucidly state your mission and values. Right? So

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       what do you believe in Isla? Or are you just a naked, grifting hip hop slang, slang, slang by 9:30 PM, chance of posting, filled the APP amphitheater, 15 year old blonde girls in days. Daisy do that. This guy wasn't there the whole time. I guess he was there every minute like these, you know, these youtubers that could jake, Paul Kohn, although those guys, or at least having fun kind of in a way this guy's like back there with a notepad. Let's look at all these young kids having a good time. He didn't even state his values. He didn't even give us his mission, state markers, values. He didn't even tell me to vote. Postman did not want to tell me to vote, you know, fucking asshole who was this guy has no friends by the way.

Speaker 4:          00:48:25       Maybe he does, but they're all like, I have a feeling when they're, they have dinner parties and for dessert they'll lay in a circle, knows to ask and Fart in each other's face. It's like a snake. Like, okay, you guys ready for dessert? Let's all get in a circle. And then you put your nose right in your, uh, your partners asked and then you fall dinner back in each other's face because they liked the smell of their own farts as the joke. Arrogant. It was just what I'm trying to say. I'm by 9:30 chance of posts he filled the amphitheatre, 15 year old blonde girls and daisy dukes and champagnes and blunts shirts, shrieked as if postpone. We're next to the lineage of backstreet boys. Girls that I wanted to fuck, but sadly will never have the opportunity, the Jonas brothers or one direction. The main difference this time is that they honored their hero with matching temporary face tattoos, barbed wire on the forehead, a knife like crucifix. On the cheek and his trademark phrase inked and cursive. Stay away and rest. Easy temporary faced. Yeah. I know a bunch of gang members with their rose in Troy Aiken, jerseys and beer bong, Bentley. March, a merge grunted with Siemian Glee. 1,000 people rocketed up, stood on their seats for a brief moment. There was palatable fear of being stampeded the death at postmortem concert, which of course requires the deceased to be buried in a racecar shaped coffin wrapped in the rockstar energy drink logo to it. Are you trying to be funny?

Speaker 4:          00:50:06       Three M and m's song served as his intro. Oh, I love that. They make this about race watch, presumably a tested nod to his fandom, but also a heavy handed reminder that postman was the most popular white guy and hip hop since Marshall mathers. Who the fuck criticizes a m and m at the moment when the hysteria seemed in danger of laney posts took the stage to definitely tears. Scorching jet flames and billowing clouds of smoke like a groupon version of a kiss concert in 1975. A group on version. First of all roof. There's no group on version you when you get groupon, you go so you can get a discount. You get a disk, you see kiss. Your analogies are all twisted. Buddy. You should have said a dollar store version because group on gets you into the show.

Speaker 4:          00:51:00       That was a weird one. You know what? Get me. Maybe you need to go back and finish your degree. Big Shot. Groupon version, sipping from a Red Solo Cup. He soon began slurring too young. He's like, he's not. He makes it sound like he's so drunk. He can't say anything to talk about. Now with a voice like bong water bubbling and the casual misogyny of a member of a red pill subreddit. What the fuck? Come on. So here you go. A direct connection to like some outright red pilling. It's like, dude, that's in your mind. That's not what's there.

Speaker 4:          00:51:40       I actually can't read it because he believed everything out. My whip fast, my bitch bad. I guess I skirt, skirt that coop fast. My coop fast. Your bitch. No, my bitch slow should do what I say so. And she always keeps me on my toes. Those lines are as good as any representing weapon alone is working on a lyrical level will have to say if he's picking out the most misogynistic stick, red pilled Eric's lyrics, that ain't, that's not that persuasive because that's gonna be a real task to start looking at lyrics. So hip hop. Yeah, I mean, and the truth that like Kendrick Lamar who is applauded by all has a great line and from his new album where he says he's fears being judged by his, um, his most baselines. You know, and if this is the best you could find through this, not, that's really not convincing me that he's a red pill subreddit, you know, on recordings, his falsetto is afforded a modest four cylinder strength, but on stage it comes off slurred and sloppy. Switching like roadkill, twitching, twitching, like roadkill, limp off. Key notes underscored by a booming backing track that operated like a life preserver. I'm going to get amped up tonight. Who was left up tonight if I forget the words because I'm too drunk, helped me sing along. He told the crowd is the same applause line that he used at Coachella is entire set list was essentially identical to what he played at every festival all summer long. Right down to the mono Cylo syllabic curse laden between song, babbling about haters, the importance of

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       rocky raking out. That's what caught. That's what's called a set. Pretty normal. Yeah. That's why it's called a set. If you're like, he's been doing the same thing for 10 years. That might be interesting. He's been doing the same thing all summer. It's called a set. He tours a lot. You've got to know. You know, you got to set. You guys hear that the rolling stones played painted black at their concert. I love that. Post Malone dare to come out with a set. When I go to festivals, after I'm done with my arts and crafts booth, I like to enjoy spoken word. It's different every time it's performed as if as if the people coming to a show don't want to hear the fricken classics, and by the way, that guy has two albums. It's all there. You know what I mean? Even if it's voice barely slithered passed the 10th road. It doesn't matter if fans who knew every word, they were there to commune to songs such as better now, his latest anthem and interchangeable heartbreak, presumably made for streaming at that Wa who's fished up those kiosk and lax

Speaker 10:         00:54:33       wet.

Speaker 2:          00:54:36       Uh, the problem isn't necessarily that it's crass, but that it's meaningless. I thought he was crashed. I thought it was a red pillar. It's not that it's stupid, but it's vacant. It's the losing difference between appropriation and outright theft. Woo. So there he's actually accusing him not just of a cultural appropriation, which is a high charge enough but outright theft. And by the way, this music is only fit for streaming at Wa. Who's fish taco kiosk at lax? Did he get a kickback from the Taco Kiosk? Does see this guy is involved in big fish taco kiosk money,

Speaker 2:          00:55:21       by the way. I know this article upset him too because he tweeted out, fuck you. The same day it came out, which I presume was in response to this article because you know, it's like, dude, he's not trying to be anything. He's not. He's not trying to be, he's not being a fraud, he's not being, you know, he's being authentic, so if you don't like it, I understand it's not for everybody, but it seems to bother you that everybody seems to like about you, but you have to make it seem like it's the fabric that's tearing our country apart and it's really not. I personally find articles like this to be more damaging than anything possible. Loves doing it. It's not his fault. He's popular. He's doing what he's always done. He's making music. He likes people, liked him and they attached to him and they like what he's doing.

Speaker 2:          00:56:16       It's not his fault. He's popular posts. It's like, okay. He didn't cheat his way. The top yard in Postville as music is dead eyed in ignorant, astonishing Dole and it's materialism, abandoned an abandoned lot of creativity with absolutely no evidence of traffic and it's cerebral cortex who you are so smart. You are so smart, and there's also a negative side. Wait, wait, this was all good. Even if it's intention is sincere. Homage, the blood during wet. What lists limit imitation can't help but feel like minstrelsy good verbiage, verbiage here, wait for like a minstrel show, like face kind of thing, right? While people will inevitably appropriate the most culturally relevant music genre, one that's becoming almost interlink, intrinsically bound to the modern conception of pop, but it's not asking too much to attempt modest synthesis or the incorporation of a single new idea, or at least to not be so grotesquely desolate. We went from eminem to Cheddar Bob [inaudible]. Shout out to Cheddar Bob. If posted one were black, he wouldn't have sold half. He simply wouldn't exist.

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       There you have it right here from Bob Weiss. More and more we don't read the thing and you get the idea, but I just think it's just, you know, it's a little dramatic. What's most, what's most damning? This post Malone's bloodless abyss of soul and funk. How do you have a bloodless attempts at being emotional feel like hallow gestures? It goes on and on. I'm president at a bullseye on his head. You could go to right here, plus most problem Postville. His problem is that he isn't a bad person or even completely untalented. Thank you. Thanks a little towns lists. I'll, I'll admit this, you're not completely on talented. Um, it steady stands for nothing at all. I think almost in a way could for him, you know, because music doesn't need to be political. Not everything needs to be political. He's an entertainer that's supposed to be an escape.

Speaker 2:          00:58:46       He can afford to feign the swagger and cool and hip hop when it's convenient and opt out when it's time to see who's writing for the cars. It's always been a fairly straightforward compact when it comes to hip hop. If you're a white person eating off of what has historically been black culture, you have a certain obligation to repay that creative debt. Eminem continues to attack. The hypocrisy is and contradictions that allowed him to leap frog equally gifted artists. That's a strong statement. Macklowe or may have lex subtlety or rudimentary understanding of when to share text messages, but there are no questioning.

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       His dedication to confronting his white privilege. Even g eazy repeat, even g eazy dropped out of that racist h and m advertising campaigns. So here you have it, you know, one more. Can you say, um, yeah. Post Malone so perfectly represents, is idiotic currents that have carried us into this present cultural submersion. We're an objective notion of the truth has been systematically muddied. Come what? That's not a stretch. Come on. Trump lies, therefore, post Malone as popular. Damn facts aren't negotiable and any hint of criticism and be it for lacking integrity, dignity or talent can be brazenly dismissed as the pitiful cries of haters. So congratulations. I guess who allowed this to happen? What a whole new system allowed this grease. Discarded. Barbecue, a wrapper to prosper if fake Pale king sitting on a tin foil thrown returned to sender. Oh my God, you're so bitter.

Speaker 4:          01:00:24       Dude. I love how bitter you are. Who allowed this guy to write pitchfork? He's like a, here's my English degree. And um, here's a list of all the. I couldn't believe how many it was when I was reading it. Like that's what articles are. I feel like there's, you know, I feel like there's a point to be made here, I'm not agreeing with it, but I understand if somebody wants to make a point, but, but, but to be so mean and better to comment made it into an Arctic. Right. It's like an elegant youtube comment. Um,

Speaker 11:         01:01:03       you could make the point that like pop music is vacuum, but one, you wouldn't be the first person to make that point by a long shot. And two, it's not like he's even like the biggest example of that. I mean, you know, he's competing like he compared us to a post unfavorably to one direction and like backstreet boys, it's like, that was just as vacuum. Like their lyrics aren't fucking deep. What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, hit

Speaker 4:          01:01:26       me baby. One more. You know, it's the same. Even write the music. They were like fucking fully. At least he's a songwriter. Exactly. I'll admit he has some. He's not without talent. I don't know. The guy is just a dick. He just seems like it. And people who don't know anything about him read this and. But you know what, that's, that's, that's part of the game. The bigger you get as part of the game. But the good news for Post Malone is that he's got a lot of love and a lot of fans. And it's funny you say that because if you compare him to his contemporaries and my opinion has music is a cut above. It is more, it's nicer, it's better I think. Yeah, whenever we put like a random playlist of like top top hits or whatever, well I can't stand most of them.

Speaker 4:          01:02:13       Yeah, I agree. I mean, and again he, he, he makes it seem like he owes a debt to hip hop. And again that's a whole theoretical debate. I don't know. But what if you're going to talk about that? His genre is not. Exactly. Exactly. He's not really a wrap merge of. He doesn't. What actually he does it wrap. He doesn't wrap. He said even in the video they say his biggest inspirations. Bob Dylan. I mean he's closer to rock and roll. Then he was like hip hop or rap or like rnb maybe. I don't know, but he doesn't know. Anyway, whatever. So there you go. I read that and I was like, damn, this is a dick and he's wrong. And the thing is, he's, he's so desperate to make it political because most of them doesn't. He's just not a political guy and they hate that.

Speaker 4:          01:03:05       So if anything, you're the problem buddy. Musicians are political. I mean there's a lot, a lot art mean a lot aren't. A lot of them are a political, a lot of them just want to stay out of it. Well the problem is that he's posed with guns screw spooky and he's from Texas extra spooky. So like, um, a lot do speak, but as part of this whole, you know, it's so obnoxious man, like let people be a political. He can be a problem with that. Just let him be like, you don't have to drag everybody into the fight. If he doesn't care about politics, does it have to force it? Like, I don't know. And he's a young guy too, like he's focused on music. He's not reading about maybe later in his life maybe he wasn't exactly. No one needs to force it. And like, he likes guns, like again, you can be on either side of the spectrum and be pro.

Speaker 4:          01:04:05       That doesn't mean he's not in favor of sensible gun laws. I don't know what his political stance on that is one way or another, but it's like let some, let people be unpolitical. Maybe he votes and maybe he cares about politics, but like, just fuck. Just the people that listened to him want to chill anyway. Spoke enough about that. Love only love to my boy posts alum. Um, and it doesn't smell. He doesn't understand. For the record, he does not stink. I want to clear that up. Let's clear the air. Smells good? Well, I haven't smelled him. There's no smell. There's no suits. Neck and took. I took a big old stacks. It was good. Yeah. Dance. He hasn't washed his nose since. I'm all right Ron. So guys, it's time to play. Know your meme. That's right. The biggest game on in the world. The biggest game in the world. Hands down. No. Me.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       Yes. Today's guest is legendary. Run for the cube. We've got him. He's recorded eight different phrases for our lucky color and they have to guess what he said. Okay. They got to get five out of the eight. Correct. To win a brand new Samsung Galaxy s nine plus or retail value of a $1,000 for our lucky color. So let's get started. Here we go. We've got chancellor on the line. Chancellor, are you there? Hello? You're on the air. Oh yeah, I'm here. How's it going? And chancellor or you feel unlucky today. Are you familiar with run the cube?

And do you think uh, you know what, I was going to make a post malone thing, but let's not get political here. Uh, I liked posty going. Yeah. No, I like both, but I think I just talked about it for like four years now. Tell me, tell me, have you watched a lot of run for the cube videos? Are familiar with his style, his delivery?

Speaker 2:          01:06:40       Well, without you guys was video like four years ago. I would never have known about him, but I've seen a little bit of him, but let me actually in our audience with run for the cube really fast, for those who aren't. Oh Wow. This one is 13 million views, so he only shows around. That's right. That's his classic. He only shows his hands green surgical gloves and he takes a scalpel and tweezers and dissects them as if they were living creatures and the cadence of his voice in the case that he has some sadistic pleasure in it.

Speaker 12:         01:07:15       Let's see if nice to have a g line. P like rat glue. My Kanye love. He's just a strong. He's obsessed with eyeballs. Be Brain surgery, so there you have it. That is

Speaker 2:          01:07:46       run for the cube. As I said, run from the cube was more more accurate in some cases, but with that being said, chancellor, are you ready to play? Yes, I'm ready. All right. Hit me with the tension. Let's start from the top. What is he saying? Here we go.

Speaker 10:         01:08:09       Are you. Are you. Are you doing for your mind? Are you Chris?

Listen closely.

Speaker 10:         01:08:44       Are you? Are you. Are you doing for your mind? Are you

Speaker 12:         01:08:53       good? All right. What did you hear? Chancellor charge gibberish. I thought he said something about are you crying at the beginning? I'll give you a hint. Colby person is your hint. Oh, are you crazy? Are you coming on the board? Strong. Great. Pleasure that. Hey. Hey. Hey. Come on in this together. Okay. We got to navigate this guy.

Speaker 12:         01:10:25       because I, I, I see it written so maybe I know, maybe it, maybe it's not yellow. It's one of those optical illusions where and when you hear like the one that was 70 anyways. Well here we go because I thought those two were going to be easy. And this one, this is the one that I thought that was. That was the start with the freebies. All right, well you know you only need to get three more, right? So you've got all the chances and. Okay. Here we go.

Speaker 12:         01:12:49       I think this is, I think where we're at a time. Do you have a final answer? Oh, I love memes. That's all I got. So the real answer was I loved big connect made famous by. Of course. That's okay. Your three out of four, which is very good. That's an excellent record.

We're going to hook you up with fascinating and a surprise item and the Samsung, what you have won. You've earned here today, so thank you so much. Appreciate you and have a blessed. Blessed had Friday and a great weekend. Thanks for calling.

Speaker 10:         01:19:26       Alrighty. Thanks guys. And congratulations on the baby.

Speaker 4:          01:19:30       And of course I want to run for the cube who was gracious to participate with us on this. No, your little legend. I appreciate all of our members who are legends in their own right, who come and lend their expertise to us and a love, love, love, love, love, love. So thank you for the cube. Um, wow. That was thrilling. Shoot. It's always really fun. I love those. I can't believe that we got him. Yeah, I know all the people. He's for the queue. That's right. We've got a lot more to get to. My goodness. We've got quite an episode here. My dudes on this blessed at Friday, so next up is the. Oh, we've got the mom. Let me see here. I've got Kanye, but actually we were going to do harass the teachers suing her student. Let me do that first and then we'll have a in hop in here to give us a Kanye update.

Speaker 4:          01:20:32       Kanye moves at light speed. A lot goes on in that man's life. So this is a story that blew my mind. And listen, I'm not, I just. This is not like a social justice thing. I'm not, I'm not, that's not my angle here. I want to say I'm genuinely confused by this. I'm just, I'm perplexed. I'm vexed in the words of the Great Bob Weiss who wrote that article about post Malone. I like to be vexed at my concerts, like to be like that when I relaxed in the new music. So there's videos on buzzfeed and it is about a teacher who is suing, I believe the age was 13, still suing her 13 year old student for making fun of her in class. Um, for being gay. I guess. I don't know. It's really hard to tell from the video, but it's so strange. The whole story is so strange and I just find it strange, bizarre that buzzfeed is taking this approach, like they're doing a journalistic video, but it really doesn't answer any questions and doesn't. Yeah, and it's just, it's why it's a wild ride that I want to take you guys on. So with that being said, let us enjoy. I was harassed by my student for being gay on buzzfeed video.

Speaker 14:         01:21:54       Can you have with your students. I really care that we accomplished whatever we set out to do, but I'm also the first teacher to volunteer to get a pie to the face or an egg cracked on my head, like whatever it is to reward students. One of the highlights of my job is the fact that I probably laugh cry at least once a day because the teenagers are funny and if you let them be funny, they're really fun.

Speaker 4:          01:22:17       Such she's drinking Pellegrino. Wow. That's fancy for a school teacher.

Speaker 4:          01:22:31       Usually you have to note that she looks the part. You have to note it from them. Let's up. We're all thinking it, just saying she has a. She has a cervical look. Okay, moving on. Don't have to note it. The thing is, they were all looking at her and being like, alright, you know what I mean? Yeah. There's something going on there. She's got a specific look, you know, that's okay. Like if I saw someone walking around and like a Pekichu hat and like a reflective less than huge pants, I'd be like, oh, that guy's a raver. You know what I'm saying? She's got to look. That's all

Speaker 7:          01:23:15       is amy asked. If I'm an eighth grade English teacher, I've been teaching for about 12 years now.

Speaker 4:          01:23:22       How the school system,

Speaker 7:          01:23:23       knowing that I've impacted a student or had a good day in the classroom is really indescribable because while education does not necessarily pay well, what it does pay, um, is knowing that you've had a chance to impact future generations. My goal is always to really understand where students come from.

Speaker 4:          01:23:41       Bear in mind while they're, while they're showing this and urbino electron fit in, great. She's still selling a 13 year old student [inaudible]. I just find that those, that dichotomy of those two things. Yeah. You're assuming a 13 year old. What the fuck? What a person, not just A. I dunno, I dunno. This is so weird. I guess because he, he harassed her, but the examples she gives doesn't seem that bad. It's more like for bullying, her not harassed I guess. Um, but I guess let's, let's let the do over and apparently it didn't work

Speaker 7:          01:24:19       or a grade. My story begins at the start of the 2017, 20, 18 school year. I had several students approached me privately out of concern to let me know that a former student of mine who was following me on instagram because they wanted to keep in touch with me, had taken a photo of me and my partner and posted it to her instagram and let my current students know that I was gay. Prior to that, I had never discussed my sexuality and the classroom intentionally because I know that I teach in a very conservative climate and it wasn't something that I felt I needed to share right off the bat with students. As the year progressed,

Speaker 4:          01:24:55       somebody, somebody's picture them with their partner. Yeah, and I can't imagine that's gotta be hard to be a teacher and you know, it's so weird. When I was a kid there was no social media. Like I can only imagine like stocking your teacher and taking photos and then sharing it with all your classmates on instagram, like cad. That's messed up so kids can be men. So kids are straight up eve, especially 13. That's like the most evil age. Absolutely. You. They're all. Every 13 year olds have freaking psycho. I mean the worst thing. The worst thing I ever did do a teacher when I was in high school, I think it was our principal because you such a Douche. We like to Peter's House.

Speaker 4:          01:25:34       It's pretty bad. It's not that. It's not that bad is it? I haven't ever done that. It's not that bad. We followed him home and we're like, we found out where he is, we're going to tap as hell. Shit. I did what they're talking about in this. I took pictures and yeah, but there was no. There was no fucking my space or anything like that. Like what did you take photos with a camera when I was a kid and then we just like draw nasty shit on it, make fun of the teacher. But this is like amongst friends. This is sharing it with the world. If you drew a funny picture of a photo and that everyone at the school saw it, right. It just amplifies it times a thousand. Right. Hey, so anyway, I'm, I'm sympathizing

Speaker 7:          01:26:15       me to let me know that this was really a hot topic on the Internet. It was a hot topic on campus and people were continuing to discuss it. I went to my administration multiple times

Speaker 4:          01:26:26       in this day and age, I can't. I have a hard time seeing that. That'd be like, oh, she's gay. Maybe I'm wrong though. She says she's scared of area so I could. It could be hard probably, but also you're kind of the adult in the situation. Well, at any rate, no, I'm not judging her yet. Let's watch.

Speaker 7:          01:26:47       No, that I was concerned about this and I felt like things were getting out of.

Speaker 4:          01:26:50       I love the shot of her just walking the area just like a.

Speaker 7:          01:26:56       and the initial response was that this was the word that was used and that it would die down and to be fair, I hope so too. Unfortunately that's not what occurred.

Speaker 4:          01:27:07       Okay. So she says everyone hoped there was drama with die down, so it's not what occurred. So what's leading me to believe that somebody like started writing like slurs on the door or like keying her car or some shit like hate crimes. Right. Fix My mic here. Okay, so let's see what happens.

Speaker 7:          01:27:28       During that school year, I was also pursuing my master of Arts degree. I have to maintain an online youtube channel where I responded and reflected on things that I'd read or activities I'd completed. One night I noticed that a flood of students started to follow me on that account and then I received a comment that said, don't be stupid. Be a smarty. You can join the Nazi party now accepting dikes. So that's good. Haunt

Speaker 4:          01:27:52       this comment on youtube. This is what she said. Sadly it didn't end there. She had one person write a rude comment on Youtube. We get like 10 times, but especially it's like, are you kidding me? One every five, every personal, every defect I have as a person is apparently, it's almost a relief for me to know that every negative attribute of my, of my personalities because I'm Jewish and that really actually takes the load off. I thought I was just, I guess I guess I can't do anything, but yeah, no, I thought I had a, like a lot of development and maturing to do, but it turns out I'm just a job. It's kind of a relief honestly. Um, but, so this, this. What happened is this comment sets her off down at the bench. So weird because it doesn't even seem personal. Like to honestly honestly, as someone who's been on the receiving end of shitty comments, like it's not that bad. It's not personal and it's kind of like, it's kind of just a stupid thing because it's like the Nazis

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       are accepting dykes. Like, that doesn't even make sense. It's just being cheeky. Obviously rude and I entered what I understand being upset by it. But what happens is it sets her off on this personal crusade of trying to find out who wrote this comment a comment on youtube. So now she goes on like this war path. And that's what was going on

Speaker 4:          01:29:21       my mic. Okay. It's

Speaker 2:          01:29:25       why is this thing not tight? Little droopy did I don't understand. Why is it true? They got pills for that.

Speaker 4:          01:29:32       Where that. Oh, here. I think. Is your mic drooping? I know I should do that during our testing.

Speaker 2:          01:29:41       Why it's dripping. It's dripping all over the place, Dude.

Speaker 4:          01:29:46       Alright.

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       This is where the podcast is. Good technical issues. Coffee. My exhale. Fuck that. So anyway, she goes. So if she just ignored the comment and she was like, she said it's just drama. It'll die down. But she goes on this war path to say who wrote that comment? And this ends up being her demise as far as I can tell. But like here we go.

Speaker 7:          01:30:12       I immediately took a screenshot and send it to my administration and asked them to sit down with me. It took my administration month to meet with me. What do you want me to do with the decision was made

Speaker 2:          01:30:23       someone at your school. It's one youtube comment. So like she, she sent it to the principal and she was like, you haven't suspended anybody yet, but anyway, here, let it, this little app shut up. I'm going to play the video about tolerance to presented to the class

Speaker 7:          01:30:40       I did that immediately, sent it off to them and unfortunately they decided that they didn't like the direction of the lesson and I was told that it would occur later on what someone else had a chance to review it. I had started to experience some severe depression and even more severe anxiety about being in class because I felt like I didn't know what was being said about me or what was being done and I also felt like I wasn't being supported or kept safe the way that I believe I deserve to.

Speaker 2:          01:31:08       It was this bananas, this one comment. Now all the sudden she's, she's, I feel like it's just not the right job for her. Being a teacher is tough. You got to have like really tough skin or you know, especially like we said with their middle school teacher. Yeah, he's our fucking brutal man. Nobody's going in as a gay teacher in a conservative area. You kind of have to know this would happen and you didn't know and she purposely kept it. Yeah. But you know, there's a chance that someone will find out. So I was surprised she was a teacher for 12 years. I've never encountered anything like, but I just find it you, she said she's tougher toilet and she had a meltdown over one youtube comment and I just imagined like print the carrying a print of it to the principal and being like, you need to do something about this. Like what?

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       It's like I, even if you sympathize, it's like, what do you want me to do? Trace the Ip called the cyber police and so I, I can only imagine what that presentation look like that they vetoed. They're probably just like, this is weird. You're going to make a presentation over one random comment and also you're going to get worse. Yeah. Okay. Everybody. I saw this comment calling me a dyke and saying that the Nazi party is accepting and I want to know who was it, and I put together a presentation that's like inviting the old, don't feed the trolls as they famously saved, okay. By the

Speaker 7:          01:32:45       I asked my students to those shots Topia during a presentation, one of my students made some disparaging comments about gay marriage, which elicited quite a response from my students, a lot of excitement and looking at me and definitely awaiting a reaction after that. Upon reviewing the student's written work, I noticed that some more derogatory comments were used about gay people in her work and I brought that again to the attention of my administration and my administrators felt like the best course of action. There was simply a teachable moment. I contacted my union at that point. From there it escalated to me getting a regional rep involved from my union who eventually hired me. A lawyer.

Speaker 4:          01:33:28       Just imagine wanting to expel a student. It's like you're ruining. You're trying to ruin the kids alive. It's like you're the adult. I know they said something really mean and rude and homophobic. The 13. Okay. They're pretty ignorant, but I feel like if she took it in a different way, maybe she. Yeah, maybe she could have turned it into exactly something that would teach them. Like you be tolerant about it. What did you, what did, why did you say that? What do you think? Yeah, but. And then the principal actually seems like pretty cool, like even headed about it, but like wanting like what is she? She's like, this person wrote something homophobic. She's like out for blood. Like you have to expect like the fuck you know, you're going after a kid man. I mean they didn't threaten her or do anything like totally insane. And then the realm of normal child behavior to be a Douche due to anxiety and depression. Amy took a mental health leave from teaching. Her case is currently being litigated for what?

Speaker 7:          01:34:31       I haven't been in the classroom since January and I would say that there are two things that I missed the most. First and foremost,

Speaker 4:          01:34:37       I love my colleagues. I am lucky to work man. It's like a commercial for depression. She's just out there picking grass. She's not in the classroom anymore. Fuck

Speaker 7:          01:34:50       incredible educators in terms of students and very sad that I didn't get to read Fahrenheit 4:51 with them or be there for their eighth grade graduation.

Speaker 14:         01:34:58       It was really challenging for me to miss out on both of those things. I don't feel frustration or anger towards students. I think that, um, as teenagers we're always, you know, they're growing and they're changing and they're formulating their own opinions. The onus really lies on the adults in the system to do better. And that's what I feel most disappointed in. I don't even feel anger towards the adults in this situation. I think that, you know, my ultimate hope is that everyone learns and grows so that we understand that, that

Speaker 4:          01:35:27       close up man, buzzfeed shots way to close up, show me the ear and Jiggling and picking grass

Speaker 14:         01:35:37       next time. A situation like this occurs. We create a culture where

Speaker 4:          01:35:41       she's got a job up per of plural feed. What do you call that? Dan used to be a Raver, right? Laura? Laura, peace. Love, unity. Respect, right? Yeah. You got to do you. You're not the only one that's partnered for life, baby

Speaker 14:         01:36:02       excepted and doesn't happen again. Oh, you walked at a screen.

Speaker 4:          01:36:07       We reached out to amy school for comment. We include an excerpt from the response in the description. You didn't want to show it to too many people. Okay, so she. She's suing the school, not the student. Is that. Am I understanding that correctly? Why? I thought it was the student, but it doesn't actually say it says. Yeah. It doesn't say. It says [inaudible]. Litigation is ongoing. I would think it's. If anything it's cool. I don't know why I thought it was a kid. I remember reading that somewhere, but I am an idiot. I just don't understand what the school could have done. I don't understand what the litigating is for. I don't understand. I don't even understand why this is a video at all. Yeah, like there's no story here. How is her making a youtube channel even under the responsibility of the school? Exactly, exactly.

Speaker 4:          01:36:53       It's youtube. Do people can find your videos. Yeah. And did she say she was a. She made the youtube channel for the master's degree that she was trying to get. So this is like an extra trip. This doesn't even have to do with her work. How does she even know it was a student who made don't know. Here's a statement from a school's boring. It's very just what you would expect to be very illegal, but I'm just. I just, I wonder why this video even exists. There's no information. Nothing happened as far as I can tell. It's like, what? What are you trying to prove with this video? She's out there. Kids are assholes. Like that's it. She got us good. Yup. Got It. This Day and age, I was such a dick to. My teachers. Definitely took, you know, and they, you know, they, they were adults about it. They just, I just moved on every time some one of my students, me, I want

Speaker 2:          01:37:55       their life ruined and them to be expelled from school. Had to have to switch schools. I want them in prison. I want them at juvenile hall for any crime. So there you go. I don't know. Buzzfeed is like, it's like, did you. You didn't even have to make this year. There's a no story.

Speaker 4:          01:38:13       They just. They had this artistic vision for the close. Yeah. They're like, we start with the closeups and we build around that. I had this vision of a bouncing, hearing, Chubby hand picking grass

Speaker 2:          01:38:28       art right there. Yeah. That is art, isn't it? There you have it folks. I don't know why.

Speaker 4:          01:38:35       Well Shit. Do we have to change the title? We change it. When we finished, I was thinking the same thing.

Speaker 2:          01:38:44       Y'All got baited not as spicy. No. Not as spicy, but still pretty spicy. What else we got? Kanye is back at it. Ian, do you want to come? You want to come? A decode. Connie decoded. I'm sending them in. Here we go. Here comes in. Let me play you a song. I got a song here. Where is it? Here we go.

Speaker 4:          01:39:08       Thank you man. What's going on with my mic? But it's drooping like my fricken, like every, like it's giving me flashbacks. Don't need this. My face did. How do I fix this? Hey, and having mic issues. Fines very. This very virile Mike over here. Yeah, you're a young man. You're a young man to know and is also sick, so I don't know how to fix this. There you go. Now I popped a couple of eds. I'm upright. I'm. How's. How's the sound right now? Sound good. Really isn't not supposed to been filed that. No, that one's less directional.

Speaker 4:          01:39:54       Just popped a couple. I took more than directed. Commoditized. Ian. How are you today? God bless. And good evening. Good afternoon. There's something about you immediately want to touch and stop. Yeah, I'm doing good. I'm, I'm back there. Coffin to and places of fucking petri dish of Ebola. Um, now before we get into this, I want to say congratulate you. I heard the great news. You've been made an honorary moderator of our Kanye. Then youtube red, which is, but that's a, that's a huge community. Yeah. They told me this morning, so congratulations. Thank you. Now I know they got up to those guys. I know the Kanye. If a community is very important to you and how do you feel about being given this honorary title? I feel like the queen kind of [inaudible] because he was like, you don't have to actually moderate. We don't. It kind

Speaker 15:         01:40:54       of was like, we don't want you to. Don't touch anything. We want to put your name there and.

Speaker 4:          01:40:58       Wow, that's cool. That's cool. Good. They don't want me to start banning people and digging around, but yeah. So I feel you're getting street craig, you're getting acknowledged for, for um, there was also the invitation to the Kanye podcast, which is coming up. Uh, what's the name and when is that happening? So people can tune in a,

Speaker 15:         01:41:22       it's on the 10th, I believe. Next I'm going to record it. I don't know when he puts it out by the. It's called watching the throne.

Speaker 4:          01:41:29       Watching. Yeah, the premier Kanye West podcasts. In fact, the Kanye himself follows them on twitter, a recent development which has led us to believe that Connie is a fan of Ian and it's been a along as, as happened with the purple hat and everything. So congratulations. I'm waiting for you and it's going to be against. Yeah, I'll be on there. So watching the phone, it's only a matter of time until I get a knock on my door, I open it and there's Kanye someday be be a great guest. Me. I joked about it. I said, if Kanye ever comes on here as a guest into going to sit here, I'm not gonna say Shit, I'm not going to be in the room. I'm just going to. Maybe I'll sit there and I'll just, I'm not going to say shit. Wash these two thought, but be that as it may, there's been a lot of Kanye development actually. Is this a good place to start in?

Speaker 15:         01:42:21       Uh, yeah. This is, he tweeted this out. He's trying to Kinda clarify his beliefs. Political beliefs a little bit. Probably got tired of all the heat. He was getting lots of heat, lots of heat friends and family, you know, dumping him. But he didn't really like. I know I read these tweets and these, this doesn't mean much.

Speaker 4:          01:42:45       Let me read you. Yeah, go ahead. I would like to take my family loved ones and community for supporting my actual beliefs of my visual. Is this before or after? He disavowed, this is before, okay, so I support those who risked their lives to serve and protect us and I support holding people who misuse their power accountable. I believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents who are fighting to protect their children from violent ors. I support creating jobs and opportunities for people who need them the most. I swore prison reform, I support common sense gun laws that will make our world safer. What I see this as [inaudible]. This is a lot of liberal kind of left Lincoln leaning, uh, beliefs and I think he's trying to reach out and be like, Hey, I don't disagree with you on these points. I just like Donald. Yeah.

Speaker 15:         01:43:29       Yeah. I think he's trying to, um, which is what I've said before. He's not like a heavy political guy. A lot of this is kind of vague too. I mean like, you know, that's true. I support holding people misuse their power accountable. That's like a fun thing to say, but I don't know what that means.

Speaker 4:          01:43:49       I see it as me too stuff. Oh, okay. Or like Wall Street stuff too. But regardless, it does heat up as he lives a lot of room for interpretation. Does d dot, I mean, I. So here we go. So now there was a thing called black. What is blood exit in?

Speaker 15:         01:44:10       He's had this woman around him for a while called Candice Owens. She's kind of a right leaning political figure and she's been very close with him kind of ever since he put the hat on and like in his circle going wherever he's going, she's always around. Interesting. So she has this thing called black set. I hate saying the word,

Speaker 4:          01:44:35       it's not a good, it's not a, how do you say? A elegant to say no legs. It blacks it, right? Black say. But I mean that's, if you're trying to like combine the two words that actually makes brexit. It's a play on brexit. Yeah. Well because you need an exit, like the equity. But yeah,

Speaker 15:         01:44:55       it's like the black exit from the Democratic Party is what she wants. She wants everyone to leave and mass. And uh, so she put out merge and told people that Kanye designed it. And I think that was kind of the breaking point which sparked all of this.

Speaker 4:          01:45:14       Here's the logo and question actually. Um, and also I will say not a very well designed a. looks like someone's being crucified. And Jim Merge.

Speaker 15:         01:45:26       Yeah, it looks like some of my camp counselor would wear and

Speaker 4:          01:45:30       not very. Not very spicy.

Speaker 15:         01:45:32       No, it's not great. And so after that happened, he came out and was like, no, I, I didn't do that.

Speaker 4:          01:45:39       Yeah. And you're, you had an interesting theory about.

Speaker 15:         01:45:43       I think, yeah, all of this. Everyone thinks, oh, he's like, come to his senses. Oh, he's realized the error of his ways. I think he just didn't want to be associated with a shitty design.

Speaker 4:          01:45:53       Right. I think that he's like, I'm not offended at all by your political beliefs. I just asked Shit Week. I don't want anyone to think that I put my name on that. Yeah. What he said in response to this design was actually something that has got a lot of attention. A lot of people interacted with us. We'd have like hundreds of thousands of likes and retweets. And here it is. He said, my eyes are now open, and I now realized I've been used to spread messages. I do not believe in. I'm distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative and that Brexit logo was whack. He said, yeah, and the one before he didn't so well. He said essentially he had nothing to do with it. So what do you make of this? Is this a genuine. And when this came out I just immediately started everywhere. Like everyone thinking that it's about trump. Yeah, well that's what I assumed that it was about like, hey. Yeah, I mean that's really

Speaker 15:         01:46:50       the only assumption that make really. Well that's why. Yeah, the so many likes and everyone immediately went, oh fine. So he's back to, you know, just chilling out. And that means he doesn't like Republicans at all. I think that was, we both jumped in, which isn't the case because he clarified with TMZ, which is the next thing, but his statements. So dramatic. My, how could it mean anything else when he says my eyes are now wide open, it's like I've just, I've been awakened to this great. A misfortune, you know, I think it goes back to like with the first few tweets, I think he does it on purpose. He leaves things vague and interesting to hear. We have a, what do we have here this, so this is from the TMZ article. They reported it and their headline was something like Kanye has done with trump and then he reached out to tmz right away and it said Kanye contacted us to make it clear he did not mention Donald trump and his tweets and he's getting out of politics altogether as for being used.

Speaker 15:         01:47:51       He says he was specifically ref referencing blacks and that's it. So interesting. So it kind of. Let's see. Is there a more, uh, you know, there isn't more. Well, just more. Is there anything genuine going on here or is this just more of kind of this Kanye trying to drum up attention? What do you make of this? He's what's happening here. In part I think the honorary, a moderator of our continent, speaking for the subreddit Kanye Fan. No, I honestly, I think that this may be why I have the flu. I'm like, I'm tired. I'm worn out, I mean it just, I just want the album at this point, you know, it's, it's, it's 20 days away, is it? Well, if he's got a lot of work those out, I don't know. And then I can't take what he says. I don't know if he means it.

Speaker 15:         01:48:45       Like when he goes, I'm done with politics, maybe that's this week and then he's going to debut it and he's gonna have the Maggot hat on again. You know, it seems that that's a common theme. Yes. Oh yeah. We need a segments. We can empower port credit. It seems to be a common segment among his, a sentiment among his fans that it's like we're getting tired of this. Just give us the music. Yeah. And I, and I don't also, he can believe whatever. I don't care about that, but you know, keeping track of it all. Like you said, it's like this whirlwind, it's nonstop. He's always in the news. There's always things going on in it. It's kind of tiring. Right. Also there was a thing this week when easy as being like available for everyone now where you're following that. Yeah, he because he said a while ago that he wants eventually to make it available for everyone that's production cells out and then you're going to go to resell this.

Speaker 15:         01:49:43       Interesting. So now I think it was available, but then people were reporting that it's not doing that well and they wonder if it's because of the drama or which one. All of the past models are the new black one, two models. The last, the release before the last one was the biggest one he's ever done. He's the most wide release ever, so there were going to be shoes available, but people took that as oh everyone hates Kanye now buying them. It's just that's the most they've ever made and I think it's the same case with the new release to. Got It. But I did see a few people reporting. Oh yeah, that's because everyone. Well you are wearing a pair, you know, not right now. Not right now. Okay. Well Ian has already closed, like easiest are fundamentally for everyone and no one cares. You don't care. And then yeah, they make it about politics of course. And there you go. Well, Kanye is political, so I guess, but you know. Well we thank you for keeping us updated on the world of coming. Yeah, I know. It's complicated stuff. Keeping up with the Kardashians. It is pretty much.

Speaker 2:          01:50:50       Do you think that Ken's reality stardom has affected Kanye in the sense that he saw. Oh, keeping up with the Kardashians. Everybody cares about this kind of real life drama. Is that something that maybe lead off into Kanye?

Speaker 15:         01:51:03       No, I think he's always had a talent for this and I think that's why they're so great. They're just these marketing machines. Yeah. So you know, it's powerful. Smell Ian's to keep your ear to the grind stone. Is that a saying? Is that what they say? I don't think so. What do you keep your ear towards? Your ear to the ground. Oh, ear to the ground. To the ground. Keep to the ground and I'll go listen to the grind plate, but listen to every one grindstone and on the other.

Speaker 2:          01:51:34       Thank you so much. Thank you. Where's the song? Sorry guys. Everyone is sick. Jesus did not breathe yet. Don't break the law and the intern. Everybody we love you and the enter, he's wonderful guy. He's an asset to the show and a boy. Boy, where would we be without one? Would know a lot less about content, that's for sure. Twitch, uh, we've got a twitch streamer who had a great little clip. Um, this is kind of funny because this guy's not even a big streamer. Oh Man. Oh No, nevermind. It's not a racist. He's not even a big streamer. That's what makes it so great. Oh my God. This twitter clip has over 3 million views, but because what he says is just so. And he's a twitch streamer that has like, well, I don't know how big he is on twitch, but he has got like 5,000 twitter followers. So man

Speaker 15:         01:52:39       for streamers that I want to relate to them. I want them to be witty. I want them to be cool.

Speaker 14:         01:52:46       I want them to have that unique aspect that all of us strive to have. Um, but I need there to be a little bit of time

Speaker 4:          01:52:52       coughing super loud in the mic because I keep turning away that I want to make sure I'm not, you're raping everybody. It's helping turn more if you can. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         01:53:01       Or relationship because I don't want to talk to a fucking wall. Okay. But will, part of the thing for me is, is I specifically don't want my viewers to have any kind of relationship with me. So like that's like it kind of works out, right? I'm Kinda like I'm hitting my goal but I'm,

Speaker 4:          01:53:17       that's kind of a bad strategy which I know I kind of, I'm doing a live stream and I don't want to be connected to anybody. Maybe make videos.

Speaker 14:         01:53:27       No, you totally are. And as weird as that sounds and it's like, it's kind of like low key like God complex kind of thing is I don't feel like many of my viewers should relate themselves to me because. And this is like super, like Kinda like I got caught like kinda weird. It's like I do think of myself as better than, or not better but like bigger. This is going so there's no good way to say this. I think of myself as like above the average person, so I don't feel like many people could relate to me as like bad as that sounds. I know why.

Speaker 4:          01:54:02       Like what would even if you're so superior and intelligent and like a 2:20 Iq, huge rick and morty fan. Why would you think that was a good idea to say? Sounds like such a prick. You're just a fucking like ta also. He's like not even a big deal on twitch and it's nice just pulled up the social worker who's got like 11,000 followers. I just want to say I just want to say this and I don't want you to take the wrong way, but I do have 11,000 followers on twitter and I do think, and again this comes off bad, but I am superior in every way. I mean how many followers you have on twitter? What? Like what? Like 200. I mean case in point. You're fucking pathetic. Damn, this guy got reamed for this video. How did you think that that could be anything worth saying? Also, I like how he keeps referring to it as like a gum God complex, low key God complex. It's like, well that he knows that it sounds bad, but it's like, yeah, it did because it is bad. I can say that like what are you doing? But I feel like he's flattering himself in a way of like saying he has a god complex too because again, you're not, you're not even justify. You can't even have a god complex when you have 11,000 twitter followers.

Speaker 4:          01:55:20       Like imagine. Imagine that guy's a god. Yo. I'm so. I do. I am somewhat of a god complex. I feel like a god complex. So there you have it. Twitch and apparently there was like a video.

Speaker 14:         01:55:39       No, it's just like kind of weird text.

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       Not Better, but like no bigger than just long and no good way to say this. I think of myself as like above the average person, so I don't feel like many people could relate to me as like bad as that sounds. I know what a fucking idiot. There you go. There you have it. Nice. Oh, this store is fantastic. You, you're going to love this specifically you Ila, um, porn watching employee infected government network with Russian malware that the fucking title you've ever seen in your life. Listen to this shit. Government auditors traced a malware infection back to a single porn watching employ within the US geographical survey and the interior department watchdog recommended the US Geographical Survey Ratchet Up Internet security protocols after discovering its network had been infected with malware. So I guess there's like a government agency network that kind of connects everything and they have really strict rules about what, how you can use the internet because that's where so slick that Russia, they're like banking on the fact that some employees meeting off at work do.

Speaker 4:          01:57:00       Did you ever like put on porn at work? I'm like, why would you do that? I'll say this, I'll say that you have a lot of downtime at work. You can have a lot of downtime. Okay. It says that he reportedly used the computer to visit 9,000 adult video sites that sell fucking. That's a lot. Like if I'm browsing Reddit, you know, at work and my, my desk is facing the wall. It's like, yeah, you see some titties on the home page and you probably, you probably, you take a look but you don't do when you're not. I'm not downloading porn videos. Not like augmenting my catalog. This guy's like on fucking pornhub, like downloading shit. They said 9,000 sites. How do you want that? That's his job. Watching porn is his job. I don't know what he does with the geographical services. That's not just popping over to pornhub.

Speaker 4:          01:58:11       You either. Are you asking if I got my dick out and masturbate? No, you. Yeah, that's what I'm asking. But I did exactly. That's why I don't like watching porn at work because it's like I'm not, some people watch porn, like it's like a cooking show. So for me it's very. When I put it on and let's be frank, I'm not cleaning the pipes, getting the poison out as they say. And so, um, it's like that's kind of the reason why I don't understand going to a strip club. It's like, okay, I've never been to a strip club and I really have no interest because it's like, okay, yeah, what do you do? Go home and beat off. That's the same thing I was going to do anyway, saved the money, watch some porn, and then let some Russian malware. But you got to, you got to admire the ingenuity of these Russian, like cyber warriors putting like putting ads on porn sites with malware.

Speaker 4:          01:59:07       I mean, that's crazy. That's amazing. Um, I love, by the way, there's like digital detectives that they go. Our digital forensic examination revealed that the employee had an extensive history of visiting adult pornography websites. The hosted malware, a rope. The malware was downloaded to the employees government laptop, which then exploited the USG s network. Isn't that awesome? This is the best episode of CSI ever. The employee no longer works at the agency. We imagine trying to get his next job. He had a good run having to say why it was firing his next job. He can host a porn site. He's got 9,000 videos. Um, do you have a recommendation of me like his next job interview? Oh yeah. So tell me what part do you like over the last 15 years? Similar scandals have enveloped the environmental protection agency, securities and exchange commissions and irs.

Speaker 4:          02:00:15       Last year a DC area news network uncovered egregious on the job pornography viewing at a dozen federal agencies and national security officials have reportedly found an unbelievable amount of child pornography. Wow. That threw me off. I didn't expect that on government devices. Fucking hell. What were the people watching child porn and downloading it and they work at the government. Fuck this problem. This problem is so prevalent that a rep Mark Meadows has introduced legislation banning pornography at federal agencies three different times. I don't think you need a, uh, what's the legislation going to do this? God dammit, you guys stop watching porn on your government computers putting national security at risk. That's amazing. I hope that in 15 years there's like a, there's a story of like a movie about this, about like how the Russians hacked the wine guy watching and dumb ass downloading porn.

Speaker 4:          02:01:22       But I bet you isla of people that have private offices have, a lot of them have been off at work. It's like, well of course. I mean, you're not going to beat off in front of people. It's kind of nuts, isn't it? Yeah. So like, dude, right here, hey, you're just like this. We have seen those videos of people doing it in the library. Yeah, that's why. I mean, those guys are deranged. I don't have to say. Yeah, I've seen videos of like a drifters who come in and just start beating it in the library. It's like, Dude, magic bean that depraved though. You see some titties and you're like, all right, taking my dick out. Um, yes, yes, of course. So we made it to the two hour while I'm on. I want to finish what we've got. God it. This is a lot of male bombers, car whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:02:18       I don't care about that anymore. Children Fight Club don't really care about it that much. Judge dredd pretty cool. I'm parking intentionally break. Oh, this one. I like this one. I need to show you guys. Party intentionally breaks the floor and everybody falls through. Now before I show you this, I want to tell you that I read that there was no life threatening injuries and no fatalities as a result of this, which is surprising when you look at the footage. Looks so horrific, but it is hilarious. And especially when you learn when you read the article is that um, they felt the ground shaking and they were trying to break it. Now that's a party turning up. I don't know how to view it. And so were they placed in the screen, but um, hopefully you can make that out. Don't fullscreen the uh, the window. Just drag it to the, to the right a little bit.

Speaker 4:          02:03:11       Oh No, what I'm saying. Yeah, I got centered. Is that good? Perfect. Okay, so fucking hell. So these guys are like, whoa. The ground's all wobbly and so everybody starts jumping and attempt to actually fucking break it. And so here they go. Having the time of their life and a woopsie daisy, a thin ice. And now some of the people if you watch some books. So yeah, but I mean there's like 100 people or some of the people slanted standing up. One Dude in the white shirt, you'll see he landed. He's like, watch this guy in the white shirt here, right here. I think he slides down and he's just like, right here. He's like, what the fuck? That's crazy. Huh? So there you have it. Like the commentary just Yo, that guy just almost fell to the ground by the way. I love that. He's like everyone, like the guy right in front of him falls into an abbess. He's literally at the edge and he's like, all right, this is the presence of mind to just keep rolling. Yeah. What a legendary cameras. That's a new video.

Speaker 4:          02:04:26       Wouldn't you be panicked when you want to get out of the room at that point? Like maybe more of a idea? No, that's why you'll never be. I love it. I just loved it. They were trying to do it, you know that I grants Gretz lady drives through marathon, you know, it's just a bunch of bids. I'll save it. I want to watch a lot of these with Tom and Christina. I think we'll have a lot of good bands. Yes. Should I have this message from the, from the email, but it's kind of emotional. Yeah. So, uh, uh. Should I read it now? I asked you so it's uncomfortable so you can read it. I can already say that I probably won't be able to speak because I can't handle this show's over. No, I'll sit here, but I just am probably. I can't really talk about these subjects because I get too emotional. Okay. Nope. You just give a shout out to the. Yeah. Hey, we heard your message.

Hey Ethan, in Isla and podcast crew. My name is Hart bridges. A month ago my mom was unexpectedly diagnosed with stage four lymphoma. She recently passed her second treatment of Chemo. She's doing pretty good, but morale is low. She was such an active person, always working out and doing different projects around the house, but now she feels weak and unable to accomplish anything. We started listening to the podcast together about five months ago. We listed in the car sometimes around the house and now at the hospital during her six hour plus treatments. We both find y'all absolutely hilarious. Her birthday's coming up in November on the seventh and I was wondering if I could get you to sign a shirt for a pay for the shirt and shipping.

Speaker 2:          02:06:37       If even you could just sign it. She would love it so much and I know it'd make her smile. Just pick a great shirt. She wears a large love Ya bark. Bridgett Hart bridges. Well obviously. Yeah, dude, do we have his address? I'll have to follow up. Dan. Maybe you can follow up and get the address, but yeah, of course we are definitely be sending a care package out and um, I just, that's so sweet. I love this.
