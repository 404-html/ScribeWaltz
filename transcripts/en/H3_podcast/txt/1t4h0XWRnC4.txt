If you look really beautiful today with your Auntie and great idea, I switched like three buildings until I decided on the orange. The orange looks great and I want to thank our sponsors today. Stitch fix or ring seatgeek end quid today. We've got a whole slew of juicy topics to get to, including Greg Paul, the father of Jake and Logan. Paul has not only made a tape and what she is having a, how do I say this without getting in trouble with youtube where a, he's uh, his Janet Ohs is going into a female genitals. People have speculated that this tape, that it records his gentleman was going into another person's gender roles. Sex tape. You could say sex tape. Yeah. It's like save time. Right? That's the, I don't know. Um, he's had, people are speculating.

Speaker 2:          00:01:04       That's an underage girl. There's no evidence of that at all. Why is it still called a tape? It's not really a tape. Is it? Hmm. We need to update that sex footage. Vid tape sounds a little more like hidden away though. It's like, oh, I got that tape in my pocket. But really it's just on your phone. Yeah. So it's not that fun anymore, but sex tape, it still is. Sec State be up a post. Malone has apparently been cursed. I love this story. It's great. And of course the Hilarious, hilarious antics of reporters from the recent hurricane. Um, there's a new trend and not really a new trend. They've been doing it for ages where they just stand and hurricanes and it's hilarious. And I've put together a whole thing. So these are this, this, and so much more. Welcome everybody to the age three buck gas beyond the experience. Fully enlightened. I'm your host Ethan client with the beautiful, talented, lovely, incredible levine. He look like.

Speaker 3:          00:02:05       Thank you. Love of my life. Beautiful. Whoa. So good that well

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       enough about Ila. Let's get to the one person in the world who turns me on even more. Greg Paul now. Okay. So let's start from the top because this is a whole story that's kind of develop. So I want to explain to you guys from the top what happened. Okay. Now, first of all, I think the first thing that happened in Dan, correct me if I'm wrong on anything, but I think I've got my facts straight, is that Logan Paul's channel was hacked. Hmm. And the attacker, uh, uploaded a basically a fake iphone giveaway, which is honestly not that much of a departure from his usual content. So I'm surprised anyone even noticed because they took it down really fast. Click the link in the description to claim your free iphone x giving away 1500. I iphones. Apparently people were clicking this link and just getting like straight up key loggers and viruses, which is great. You know, all the best stuff on the Internet has to offer.

Speaker 2:          00:03:22       So that got taken down pretty quickly. And um, on Sunday the hackers released jake pauls calendar via their twitter pages since been banned. It included the address and contact info for many celebrities, including Justin Bieber. Yikes. And what was thought? This is a great twist thought to be Ethan me, of course. That's me. Um, when Jake Paul was on our podcast, he saved a dance number because he had a pre show call with Dan and he saved it as h three h three. So Dan's phone number was leaked over a blowing up with a phone call. That was fun. Tell me about that then. Um, it was a Sunday afternoon, um, was just chilling at home and all of a sudden get a call from an unknown number. Oh, that's weird. You answered it. No, I ignored it. What kind of maniac answers don't know numbers in 2018.

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       Yeah, absolutely. But as soon as it ended, uh, another one and then another one, another one, and pretty quickly I was like, okay, something, something happened and this is, this is not normal. And uh, yeah, just tracked it down to the old Jakey poop. Did you not answer one of the calls? No. No. And I didn't get any texts or anything. Yeah. Texts. Well again, because they thought it was you. So it was just all kinds of people saying what's up Ethan? And like all kinds of messages for you. So anything interesting to know? No. Really nothing interesting at all, which I mean these people, it's like you get ahold of a number of a famous person, they have no idea what to say. You're just calling the call. I'll say when I'm on my phone number got leaked previously when we got hacked dealer and they posted our phone number on twitter and we were, we were pro, I swear to God we're getting like a hundred calls a minute.

Speaker 2:          00:05:11       Fun Ways. Actually it, I can't, I couldn't access my phone cause there was just incoming calls nonstop. You couldn't like swipe it open. I couldn't even do anything. But I was getting tons of text messages and I don't think I actually ever told you this, but somebody sent me, I don't know why I even open text message cause I was generally not. But one of them was a dick pic and I have to tell you, I did feel violated. And in that moment I had a, I had a moment of like empathy and sympathy for all the females out there getting unsolicited dick pics because it felt, it felt very, I felt very violated that I saw this man. He was a fat man with the tiny small penis. It looked almost like my own, if I'm being honest, a tiny little penis. The pubes were much longer than the penis itself and I was like, whoa.

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       Is that a picture I took? No, it was someone sending me their own. So, um, and that you would think it was his fixture and not something off the Internet? No, it was definitely, dude just snapped his junk and send it to me. Yeah. So there's a fat chubby little penis. I was me to it. I've been trying to tell you that for a long time. I'm trying to take back. Me Too, for us, for me meat anyway, apparently me third, apparently the hacker, this, this kind of perplexes me, this hacker gotten to Jake Logan and their father's account, all three. Like, I mean these guys are big shots. They had run big companies. How first of all, is there security, not tighter run third of all, how do you get into all three of them at the same time? What I was wondering is are they still all on the same family plan at Verizon or some shit? You know what I mean? Like how do you explain that they got all three of their account?

Speaker 2:          00:06:57       Fascinating stuff. Well, regardless of how it happened, um, it could only happen to these geniuses. Um, apparently just so in Jake's dms, there was all kinds of stuff of him flirting with girls. I don't know, they teased all kinds of stuff, but they didn't show anything. So I don't know. But definitely the most fucked up thing to come out of it by far was the Greg Paul sex tape. Greg Paul being the father. Um, this guy's a piece of work, man. Greg Paul's the guy who has notoriously made out with little girls and one of Jake's videos kiss. I mean there might have been and he seems he wears a, he's, he's 40. How old is he, Danny? He's like 40, 50, 54. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean here, here's all you need to know about the guy. He's a 54 year old man with a puka shell necklace and a goatee. I mean that's a, it says all you need. Hit me with some of those soundbites, which is that [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:08:01       gp coming at Ya GP. He's coming at Ya two talks. He like lowers his voice,

Speaker 2:          00:08:10       talks like a 19 year old irritation of his sons. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:08:15       Yo. Hey Yo, is jp coming at Cha? Ooh, what's going on?

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       He's auditioning for the new blues clues open. Uh, anyway, so, so there was a sex tape, but there's no faces. There's some voices, obviously the girl herself. There's no way of knowing her age or identity, which is good for her. Thank God for that. I mean it's so graphic you guys. I've watched a lot of porn in my day. A lot of porn. I mean emphasize a lot of foreign in my day. This is one of the most things I've ever seen in my life. I mean, it is horrible. Mba was horrifying, truly horrific. Let me play you a little soundbite. The lovely thing was that it was just on twitter and like I just saw people talking about it going up the thread of a conversation. It's just they're on twitter and yeah, that's how I saw it first till. But I saw what I saw was like him, like fingering her.

Speaker 2:          00:09:22       But then I do my research. I watched the whole thing on one of these, uh, you know, websites and it is old graphic brothers. The one scene where he's slapping her with his Dick, I'm going to use, I'm going to use a PC words here because we are family friendly show. He uses his a carrot. He, he puts his care and her soil. But what happens is he's slapping her, slapping her peace with this carrot and she starts to water his carrot. He, she pees on his dick. I swear to God, she pees on his dick. And this is the sound that it makes this sound from the video. She pees on his dick. I swear to God. So he's slapping her and she's paying on his deck. Do you think, Eh, Fmr people would love this sound. [inaudible] Greg Faull sex dig a smrs interested. Let me try to experience stuff that space tomorrow.

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       I'm definitely getting the tone alone. I'm still in a tingle and my forehead. Um, so this video is so graphic. Um, but again, there's no, there's nothing identifying the man or, or the female. So my first thought was that, okay, it could be anyone. Let's look, first of all, I want to see is this actually Greg Paul? Not that I'm not willing to believe it. I mean I'm very willing to believe it, but I just want to know what's my hunch. So here we've got some evidence here. Um, let me see here. Um, he ready to come again.

Speaker 2:          00:11:09       Definitely sounds like a hit me with the Hemi with that Zach could be, but I will. Here we do a little CSI photo matching and this is fairly conclusive in my opinion. Um, here it's hard to tell. Okay. But like, here's a, from his instagram has dog sleeping on his bed. Now what we're paying our attention to is this floral kind of pattern here in the woodwork. And you can tell. I know it's, I know this doesn't look that good. Okay. Not, but I'm telling you, I've watched the videos, there's better screenshots, but it definitely, it matches it's the same ad board and when it's in motion in the video, a lot more evidence that it's the same thing. It's definitely the same. So what do you think is happening? But um, I thought I had more evidence than that.

Speaker 5:          00:12:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:05       Well let's leave the evidence I've got. Okay. It's okay. Let me say this. It's definitely the same headboard

Speaker 2:          00:12:14       and European and my humble alleged opinion. It's not even an opinion. It's an alleged that your opinion sir, allegedly, um, under age though. I mean, who could ever say that that's dangerous? Yeah. I don't, I don't want to put out the guys having sex with underage girls. I will believe him. He was having what I would it be a stretch of my imagination to think that greg was having sex on average girls? No, absolutely not because of him kissing. Absolutely not. Um, but what, what she had happened. Cause it's, if, what if he was what it's from some hackers. Well. Yeah, the first thought I had was like, that's not, you can't really use that as evidence in court because it's illegally obtained. Yeah. Well regardless, there's no evidence to disclose under age at all. So, um, I don't want to insinuate that now. Basically though, Greg has acknowledged that the hack has happened in this instagram video in which I will play for you all here today. Just some little, some they'll tell you over as I opened this, by the way, Greg is a high level instagram user. He starts the video with, he got a paper bag from like Ralph's supermarket and he just sharpied a message so that this would be the thumbnail. It's very creative. I am calling you. He's high level. Good. He learned it from all the teenage girls. He fucks allegedly.

Speaker 5:          00:13:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:49       Allegedly I don't even have an opinion. I haven't alleged opinion. Uh, my hacker thought my hacker taught me a lot. Please contact me so I can hire you or you couldn't find a piece of paper. Really had to use a Ralph's shopping bag. Alright, let's watch this and try this.

Speaker 6:          00:14:11       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       Oh, his GP, gp here.

Speaker 6:          00:14:16       GP coming at Ya [inaudible] come again. Come again. Come again. Should I be coming at you? All right. So how do you guys know that I was hacked? By the way? This hacker dude is something else, man. He is crazy smart. I learned a lot. Hi.

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       Sounds like such a fucking, he sounds like he's 15. Why does he talk like that? He reminds me of the guy. Isn't there a character in like fast times at Ridgemont high played my matthew mcconnery mcconaughey. Hey, he's like a 30 year old that hangs around looking confused. Yeah. What, what does, what's that great line? He, he had to ride out, ride out. Oh, there he is. I had it ready to go. He has a line. He goes, I get older, but they stay the same age. Something that's what he loves about high school girls was the line. He pretty much, is that correct?

Speaker 6:          00:15:02       Um, you know, hacking is actually in adult way of bullying.

Speaker 2:          00:15:06       What do you think about that? I thought that was kind of interesting. Hacking is actually an adult way of bullying. Is this saint him saying he thinks he's been bullied, right? No, we need to call a trump's life. Where is coming from when that statement really is a little bit but,

Speaker 7:          00:15:23       hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:15:26       Okay. And when do you think, I don't know. I just thought it was funny thing. He's being bullied. Poor guy

Speaker 6:          00:15:33       and uh, you know, I don't know why the guy does it because he doesn't get any real recognition for it. He's not really messing up my life that bad cause my life. I'm just not that important. But um, I've learned a lot from, I learned about some ways to prevent hacking and all this stuff. But Dude, if you're out there, I want you to reach out to me. The guy still has my aol

Speaker 2:          00:15:56       sound like his password was like password. I learned a lot about security. Greg Paul rules still has his aol account. Oh, I missed that. Wait, I can't rewind it.

Speaker 6:          00:16:12       You back my aol account and Cooney or information here cause I want to hire you.

Speaker 2:          00:16:15       Of course Craig Paul uses aol wants to hire the hacker throwing to jail. I think this was probably an elaborate ruse to, to get them, this was his mastermind, but you know Greg, Paul probably still has aol dial up on autopay. You know what I mean? I read, I read a stat that there's like a million people still paying all on a dial up. Like all these old people that never upgrade their internet. They're all like, I bet you my grandparents, he's like 94 still pays aol for dialogue.

Speaker 6:          00:16:53       We can use your smarts in and your skill set in a positive way and probably make you a shit ton of legit money. Anyway, a hope you guys have a great weekend.

Speaker 2:          00:17:05       Those were the two fingers. I'm just telling you honestly. He did this and boy, I saw those fingers and a bucket of pissed. You ready to come again? Anyway, I feel bad for him. Hackings no fun. It is adult bullying. You're right. I feel bad in a way. I hope that girl was at her age. All of those hackers. She's such a nice male bullying. Oh, so now you agree. I agree. I came, I came around. It's adult bullying. It's, I don't know. It's, it sucks. It's the worst thing you have to go through. It is awful. And it's like,

Speaker 2:          00:17:43       yeah, it's awful. Anyway, my heart goes out to Greg Paul and um, it gushes for him. You might say my heart scotches from one might say that and I really hope the girl was not under age for his sake. For all of our sick, for the world's sake, please greg, don't be fucking underage girls in recording it because like where the world is just not ready for that. The Paul's aren't ready for that. Youtube is not ready for that. Greg, please my heart gushes for you though. You ready to come again? All right. All right, so we can wrap it up from here. Apparently the hacker said, um, what is the hacker said that they have way more amped up evidence that they've fought it to the FBI. But yeah, who knows what? All of a sudden they have a conscious, you know, so there you go.

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       Um, Greg, I mean Greg is smashing though. You came out here. He's Jake's manager. He's apparently yes. And it's Nick Crumpton left. Greg is taken over the mantle and he is a mashing dude. You need me to play that again? Okay. Uh, moving on. Post Malone is cursed. You guys, you may have heard the recent reports that, first of all y'all heard about how his plane took off and the wheel blew up on takeoff. They had to emergency land. Thank God post Malone was okay. Next up, the next couple of days he's in a car crash or someone driving a quarter million dollar Rolls Royce, a car crash thing. God, he's okay. Got Blessed. The suite are of that man and then an armed robbery took place at his old house. That place we've been to I, if it's the place I'm thinking of, which I think it has to be, we've been there a lot of times.

Speaker 2:          00:19:45       That's scary. Armed robbers show up at the House asking more post Malone is terrifying and I'm so glad that post wasn't there. He had since moved and the tenants that were living there got stood up at gunpoint. They stall like 20,000 year. There was some things, jewelry. So I'm, I'm, I'm so glad that Austin was in there because he's a kind of, we don't call nine one, one kinda guy. You know what I mean? That would have been some, some gunfire. I have a bad feeling. But at any rate, what is going on with Post Malone? Well, we think we have the answer guys. We think we've figured it out. And of course it's TMZ who was put the pieces together. Um, posting them messing with evil spirits on video now curse plane and car makes sense. It all makes sense. Finally, this Guy Zach from ghost hunting. These guys are so funny. You know how I feel about goes something postmodern loves it though. So apparently, um,

Speaker 2:          00:20:55       there's this, uh, Zach tells us the closing encounter went down in June and is haunted museum. The object is called the Dubuque Dbu box. Dbu Is Yiddish for malicious spirit and the box inspired the horror flipped position, really yiddish. So they're saying that Jews are behind all of it. Great. It's another Jewish conspiracy. So explain what is this? So this box, this Guy Zach, the ghost hunter. It's apparently the most cursed item in the world because they're Jewish ghosts and they got it. They have a chip on their shoulder. Yeah, there's videos for this is it dude? You got, Oh fuck. Let me fuck. What the fuck dude you got? That's kind of dope. Think about that. It's like, um, of all the cursed objects in the world, you got Kirsty Gypsy shit, cursed Polish Shit, cursed whatever. German shit. Yeah, it's the Yiddish ghost. They're the most gnarly.

Speaker 2:          00:21:53       The Jewish goes. So the ones you absolutely do not want to fuck with. That's kind of it up. So here's the video that explains everything that's been going on. I want you guys to, that's a, at his house or something. It's that it's haunted museum and I think Vegas, so this is the first time he's actually apparently taken the box off or touch the case itself as the story as opposed to, and is freaking out. And he's like, don't do it. But that's where postmen fucked up. You see? See Zach, the ghost hunter knows what he's doing. He knows how to handle a curse. He talks to the box, the first one ever to do it. Awesome alone. Being the sweet guy. He tried to break them away from the box, but curse was transferred to them. In that moment. The lights are off obviously for s add spooky effect. Did like, you know, we could have the lights on but let's leave him off. Um, this is the curse. Djourou what's with the star of Davids and like, you've got like a Torah and shit. What is this? Some kind of fucking Jewish fun house.

Speaker 5:          00:23:00       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:23:01       Austin's freak the fuck out. He's trying to get out. Oh, he turned on the lights. Thank God Austin. Oh wait man. Yeah. He just turned on the light here. You can see, I'll go back. He goes back to the door. He's like, fuck this turns on the lights. Zach is trying to play it cool. Like he doesn't care. Um, but here he goes in Austin's like, dude, this is a, this isn't just any ghosts. This is a Yiddish goes cause also knows better. You know, we went, when we went go something with Austin, he was very respectful. He was very cautious about the spirits. He really, he believes this stuff and he was not fucking around, so I know that he's, he's deadly serious about this stuff. No, there was the thing where when he, when he opens the door, I think there's like something moving out of the lefty. We'll play by play, but first let's hone in on that. But first, let's see what happens. So often it's freaking out. He's got a beer in hand. He's trying to talk Zach and to getting out. He's hyper ventilate, he's breathing heavy. He's grabbing him. He's saying they run out of the room now

Speaker 2:          00:24:06       post malone being the sweet guy he was, he took the curse from Zack and these old yiddish. She goes, you know what I need to do? I think I can resolve this. What, because these yiddish ghosts, they need a good Jewish boy to come talk sense into them. I think I can channel maybe these yiddish ghosts and lift the curtain. Curse the curse. No, no, no. I am a good Jewish boy. I'm well fed. That is all yiddish grandmother ever wanted. I'm a good sweet bar Mitzvah and I think that I can talk some sense into these shooters goes, should I say a prayer? No, I think I should say a prayer to lift the curse. Uh, can you pipe me in some, a prayer, a prayer. Spooky. Yiddish prayer. Music. Should I have that? Um, this is maybe appropriate. No, no, this is too sad, isn't it? Um, angelic music. There's no, there's angels in Judaism, right? No, no, no, no, no. For Christ Sake, curse on you. Get curse on you, right. Uh, yiddish spirits. What was it? What were they called? They were called the [inaudible]. They did book the Debug, debug spirits. Cursing Post Malone. He's a good boy. He's a good sweet boy. He loves his parents. And is this the prayer? Yeah, it is not fair. This is my prayer. I'm trying to banish the, trying to banish the Yiddish goes. He eats well and I've cooked lockers with aunt for him on several occasions. We spend tradle on Hanukkah together.

Speaker 2:          00:25:52       Me and Austin have spun tradle and you are going to curse this good Jewish boy. How dare you. Austin comes from a good family and was, and also he loves Hala Bread. I know that because I've shared Hala bread with him. If you can lift this curse yiddish spirits, Dave Lik, what is it? [inaudible] book the Book and return to your box.

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       Then this Jewish boy will be forever grateful that I'm a bar Mitzvah. Amen. As this. So I need this adventure of like, eh, their book boxes on Ebay and really, and they all look so weird. It does it. One, he lives on the fucking search for some d book. Get some Debo Cup in here. Let's order one here. All we can buy the shit on it. Well, what's so special we can buy the shit on Ebay. Kid made haunted debug book box, 20 bucks. Real shit alone.

Speaker 2:          00:27:37       Okay?

Speaker 8:          00:27:38       I will spread any scene of [inaudible] to fish if you will. Just lift the curse on the sweet young post Malone. He doesn't deserve it. He looked back me up. Yes. Amen. Amen. We will spin draco. We will eco filter fish. We will share in the good times of Matzah ball soup. He's a sweet kid. He doesn't deserve this. You're an old Jewish lady.

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       calm first would appreciate that I really powerful stuff. Do it. I think I left the curse. I felt there was a change in the, uh, felt that there was a change the spirit. Meanwhile, I dunno. I felt like maybe Austin Prob, I think he owes me. Um, can we show them, and I notice this very spooky moment here. I read it in the comments, but soap go ahead of you. And when he opens the door, was it there off the top right to the point where he opens the door at the top. There it goes. There's something that flies out of the room side right here where my mouse is. It flies all the way from here out the door. Yeah. Watch this. When he opens the door, you see that? Did you see that? I see, I see. I'm telling you. Gook fest, 2000 and fucking 18. Hey right here. One more time. Watch it comes from the left side of screen out the door. There it goes. A white light. Now, a reasonable explanation. Bhag bug. It could be the reflection on that door reflecting off the camera or something like that. You know what I mean? But most likely it's a d book that came in and infected the whole fucking planet. So I need to say another blessing. Everyone's like, fuck no.

Speaker 2:          00:36:59       Welcome back. Nutty weather reporters. This has been a phenomenon that's been going on. Um, these reporters, they send them out and to hurricanes and treacherous weather crap out crack open here is 30 pounds and they make these poor sons of bitches basically brave, dangerous wins. And sometimes the ones they're not that dangerous so they have to hype up the danger themselves. We've got a little of each got a little off but what was the name of this recent hurricane? Florence. That's right. So uh, you guys may have heard there was one particular gentlemen, um, that was called out all over the Internet for his uh, Hurricane Florence meme and this guy was out in the weather channel and it's kind of this classic story of acting like the weather's insane. And then somebody walking through the back wall here. I'll let you watch.

Speaker 2:          00:38:08       All right. Now, first of all, worth noting is I'm leaning in North Carolina right away from the where the wind is blowing. Like that doesn't make any sense. People have said that maybe he's covering the microphone, but that doesn't really make sense to me cause you can see as it goes on, he's clearly not covering the microphone, just whipping through here. More heavy rain. Well they have that. Woo. He's trying to brace some stuff though. That is a pretty healthy cusp right there. When you have fun anyway, here in the beginning you can see a couple of dudes just strolling as casual as possible. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:53       And Wilmington, North Carolina, right at the intracoastal. And we're in one of these bands. This is just literally scrolling by and Patchouli as possibly do I love sneakers. There's truly no problem balancing. We're 60 miles an hour. Yeah. So there you go. Who would I thought that only on Youtube. I thought people exaggerate and right quick money. And these are like real professional weathermen is it like scientists? That's what I'm saying. You set up these atmospheres and everybody will be reduced to a clickbaiting Nice Smr, spaghetti con of Jesus Christ. I click on it starts again. So anyway, people got really upset by this, um, overdramatizing of how bad it is. I find it just funny. It's like, damn, you're out there bracing yourself the wrong way. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       anyway, the other excuse I heard, is there anything to this that it's that Oh, well he was, um, he was standing on grass is why. Yeah, I've got that from the, I'll, I'll read that later. That man, while I have a statement from the weather report, they defend him against the claims and I, I'm, I've got it all laid out. I want to enjoy some more footage of this guy bracing against the treacherous, whether raw cane and we're getting gusts pushing God still. So it goes without saying the categories. Sometimes we're misleading with hurricanes where the wind is whipping through here. More heavy guys, 40 miles per hour. Hold on there by hold on there that you have to lower your center. Hold on there by like on top Bronco or some shit. Anyway, so we've got a whole thing here. Let's see what we got.

Speaker 2:          00:40:52       So this guy got into a bunch of, of, uh, stuff and weather channel made a statement. They're supporting their boy. They're not leaving them out in the trenches. They said, yeah. And they got his back. You know, whether people, the weather people, they, they're a tight knit community. They said it's important to note that the two individuals in the background are walking on concrete. And Mike said l they name him. They name him and shame him first and last name. And Mike settle is trying to maintain his footing on what grass after reporting on air until 1:00 AM this morning and his undoubtably exhausted. Well, I mean Mike counter is just stand on the concrete. How has done the on grass changes? Anything I haven't noticed. It doesn't on growth. It doesn't really that much. They those, yeah. I don't know. It doesn't really. Um, but the weather, the weather channel, they love this hurricane shit.

Speaker 2:          00:41:51       They go crazy this day. They blew their entire production budget for the whole year. They put together these insane three d renders where these reporters stand and like a severe with a massive crazy green screen and they show you virtually like where are the water heights are, will be. And it's just so over the fucking top for what I, it's amazing. It's really cool. But they're all just so jacked about these hurt hurricanes. And here let me show you born to bring kind of crack. It's kind of crap. Look at this shit. That certainly is enough to knock you off. Beat. Definitely stole cars out. Even carry cars away as certainly flood many of the lower levels of structures, but we know Florence is also going to bring water. It's water. Yeah, no, six feet of water. Imagine that. Imagine the add on, for example, the technology of the weatherman that would otherwise be and also tommy cause higher and where else can we use this technology? Oh, it goes even higher. I go, you said it perfectly reminds me of like the facebook, the ducker cruise through Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico life's trainer, fish in the water. Why the fuck is that realistic? Cover up one story. Buildings and structures and the details. Mather, anything that's certainly pose a risk to many. There are very few places so he wouldn't be that. Now that is like, man, he's underwater. They didn't even tell his ass.

Speaker 2:          00:43:29       It's a wall. That wall. Follow the advice of your local officials and he viewed that black thing. It's the garbage bag corpse and I bet that's selling. You know, the intention is good. Heed the advice and get the hell out of there. Don't get washed away.

Speaker 7:          00:43:51       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:43:52       Don't braved the storm. You know, it's funny, I find ironic. All of these weather reporters are like, do not braved the storm. Everybody evacuated and meanwhile I'm going to do right. No one's blown away and listened to me. They tried to justify staying because it's so stupid. By over reacting and acting like till like shit, nothing's happening. There's another clip of a girl I love. I love these clubs. It's just, it's incredible. Loved their enthusiasm for hurricanes.

Speaker 9:          00:44:22       Florence is a large and extremely destructive hurricane. Storm surge is going to be potentially life threatening for some areas along the u s coastline and this morning we've seen the water picking up over some of the roadways. Let's go ahead and take a look at what could be a reasonable worst case scenario for areas along North Carolina all the way here from surf city to North Topsail beach, we could be talking about up to six feet of storm surge and again impacts have already begun today with the storm approaching even inland. It's not just going to be a coastal event here, areas along the river and that we can show you what this could look like if you were to find yourself in this scenario. Once that water comes in three feet, you can see it on my shins, my waist. This could be enough to knock you off your feet. You can eat another guy at the far side of the roadway. This is extremely dangerous to that six foot range. How high this water goes. Ooh. Wins pick everything.

Speaker 2:          00:45:17       Yeah, they did. They got a little choreography with it yet no powers

Speaker 9:          00:45:21       stand here. Even withstand the force of the water coming in. No Shit. But anyway,

Speaker 2:          00:45:29       I thought that was great. I love that. Love it very much. And then of course there was, of all things, like you said, they probably blew up all their budget. They have a production budget that they blow one week, the next toy there point is going to be on like the cell phone camera. Yeah, exactly. They don't, they can't afford cameraman anymore. Then of course there was, um, ludy interestingly, of all places, a dollar store was alluded. If you're gonna I mean a dollar store looters [inaudible] dollar store looters, that's gotta be, I mean, that's rock bottom money shit. Dot loot somewhere else. At least if you're going to break the law, could something more valuable than a neiman marcus or something? Come on. Yeah, no. Anyway, let's watch a video. This reporter is 13th and very brave. What are you getting there? Entering the cup, right? Kitchen towels. A couple of kitchen towels, some juice, some, some cheap oil.

Speaker 2:          00:46:39       That's useful. Uh, you know, you could get there. You could steal a 10 pack of sporks. What does park? It's a, it's a fork spoon combination into one utensil. Oh, there's some fancy sporks actually have a knife on the side that's outside of, that's the two. That's, you can't find that kind of quality at the dollar store though. Um, is anyone else that sat at the dollar store and not everything costs a dollar? Shouldn't even be, I think because you know it doesn't upset me because I know that you, I would go shopping in those stores and then it's what I want is like 15 $15 that no, that's too far. Yeah. If you have a $15 item in the dollar store close up. I'm alluding is what I'm at. I'm alluding your dollar store. I understand in this day and age is 2018 we've had a flesh and if you, you can kick it up to two or three bucks for a really premium, I'm talking about a spork with a knife up the side.

Speaker 2:          00:47:41       You can charge a premium for that. No, I remember even in Israel we have both stores and it's like a shotgun store that's 25 cents by the way. But then what I want would be 20 shaking. Oh give me a fucking break. Yeah you make a scene. Do, do row stuff. Do you yell and you know I just only by the the shaking and stuff. Okay. What do you buy for a shekel? That's the only 25 cents. I used to love buying stickers there cause they would have like really weird Chinese knockoff stickers when like how much money we're looking. Well that's what these people are stealing cars. This is a dollar store. So it's fun and interesting. I catch hell if I feel bad because it's like pure desperation. They might need food. I mean how desperate are you if you're stealing shit from a dollar store, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:48:34       Go for it. I say really? You say loot the dollar store. That's still illegal activity. I feel bad. I feel bad for emergency. Someone owns that store out. It's kind of drizzling. Dan. I'm not going to say that this is a life or death situation, particularly quip. It's a little bit, but you never know. But I'm saying like if you're, if you're, if you're alluding a dollar store, you're not like, you know, set for life. I mean you might be able to enjoy those stickers. If you own a dollar store, you're not set for life. Depends is it a chain is a mom and pop's dollar stores have dollar tree. Dollar tree can get looted the fuck out of it. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Damn. And when did, when did you become such a vigilante Jesus Christ? Amen. When it's an emergency.

Speaker 2:          00:49:23       I know I did not. I just remember we never did a background check on dance dance like a police murder. Anyway, wash the bravery of this lady and she confronts these awful dollar store criminals in the wake of this awful tragedy. It's a national emergency. I want to identify what they're stealing. So this guy's got a 12 pack of coke, zero by the way. Excellent taste young man. That's actually, those are mini cans. It looks like maybe a six pack of mini in the dollar store. Ralph's. Those run about three bucks. So $3 but if it's a six pack of mini cans, you might be able to get those for a buck. They're probably expired, obviously. Excuse me. Do you know that you're stealing a six packs of coke? Zero. Excuse me. What does she think? You're caught committing an act of crime. You're supposed to stop and do a little interview. You know what I mean? Can we see your face please, sir? And uh, your name and phone number and address.

Speaker 4:          00:50:36       I'm really curious about both feeling or you know, your lips.

Speaker 2:          00:50:39       Wait, the kid playing. I went, oh, I'm just try. I really want to identify what they've gotten. The car correct. He's got what looks like a tub with like maybe some detergent. Well, tupperware. I mean, look, if you're willing to steal detergent.

Speaker 5:          00:50:54       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:54       Well anyway, Chris Stealing is stealing folks on that, right? Just say it.

Speaker 4:          00:51:01       You know that you're alluding and

Speaker 2:          00:51:03       the law in and compromise everything I stand for as a human being to get a free six pack of coke. Zero expired. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:51:10       You can see people coming out apple juice with items left and right from the store. It's like when you're in class and new

Speaker 2:          00:51:17       kids are cheating on the exam. She's like the kid that's like, I see you guys. She's a nurse. She's a fucking snitch is what you mean? Yeah. I see. Nobody wanted, they like candles. There's a full shelf of like candles or like something on the,

Speaker 10:         00:51:36       we'll get this star. Yeah, that's like trash. He's so concerned.

Speaker 4:          00:51:44       I can go back around front guys. Right? I mean, there are no books. She's truly brave law enforcement onsite. Oh Shit. No law enforcement. Excuse me sir. Um, what are you going to be doing with that? A small can of tomato paste talking to me. All right, look across the street here. People are filling up what looks like laundry bags full of items. Wow. Running. It's a mass mixer here. And let's go back to the front crystal. Excuse me sir. What are you trash bags.

Speaker 2:          00:52:17       You are stealing a, what are those toy guns with like little car. Anyway,

Speaker 4:          00:52:22       this is a, this is what's the worst of the worst than these hurricanes folks. People

Speaker 2:          00:52:30       expensive. This is the worst of the worst at this is as bad as it gets. Huh? Thanks. Think I, they ain't losing your house. There's people that some for kids taking like a six pack of paper. They just on the ground. This is as bad as it gets walks. Meanwhile, people are fucking dead. Their houses floating down anyway, it's all funny. It's all funny. I'm not saying Ludy not defending allude in, uh, at the situations. Hilarious. They're alluding a dollar store. You got this reporter that thinks she's like on the ground in Vietnam or something. You know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:53:06       Did the worst and these hurricanes folks, uh, people getting desperate looking for items looks like they've just busted completely through the door here.

Speaker 2:          00:53:16       I would watch, I could watch, I swear to God can wash worship, I don't know, 30 minutes. I love that clip. Cool. Wonderful stuff. Really great stuff. Um, what else we got? Uh, manner of time. Oh yeah. So here's another bozo out and the storm from the hurricane. Now this guy,

Speaker 7:          00:53:39       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:53:40       on the opposite end you've got do it pretending to be in danger and then you've got dude, cause you send these reporters out when sometimes it is actually dangerous and this is one of those times

Speaker 4:          00:53:50       what is like fill it back to you. 10 before we let you go. Some of these

Speaker 2:          00:53:55       tad, before we let you go, we want to make sure that you die

Speaker 4:          00:54:00       some of these different live shots. Okay. We've seen, we've seen people wandering around a little bit. Are those reporters outcome rate or or are you seeing residents in the area just kind of coming out and taking a look at things? This morning I, I've seen a couple reporters out driving around, but as we, as we turn around now, there aren't many that we can see. They're starting to be a couple of the people who have stuck around that gentlemen down there. And a yellow raincoat is a local land by huge, uh, sheet metal is a little shock. We're okay. That was just not cut a little spoon. You're going to be surprised and I think he's ready to get out of there. Yeah. Oh, it's good to go. I don't know about this. Go and I'm gonna let you guys go,

Speaker 2:          00:54:52       ted, before you go, uh, can you tell us how did that feel getting hit by a sheet metal? Do you see any other debris flying around? He pulled that on him a tad before you'd go. You're not getting paid extra hour regular. Right. I'm going to head out of here. I'm going to let you guys go a Ted before you go. Can you tell me? Do you see corpses around? Do you see any other flying debris? By the way? The one thing that's always common in these reporters out on the field, they're getting blown away and acting like the world's in chaos. The camera man is standing there holding the super heavy thing. He never fucking budges, you know that's true.

Speaker 7:          00:55:37       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       Or you go, not all heroes wear report her outfits. Right. Well Sadiola I give that as a word at us were before you'd go ted, can you uh, go near any glass windows that are left it up? Bust out. All right, ted. Oh, looks like Ted got hit by a sheet metal before you go ted.

Speaker 7:          00:56:13       Anyway, good stuff. Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:56:16       Do we have quality content here or what? Um, and then of course you've got some classic ones that I wanted to share with you guys. You may have seen it, but these are my favorite ones as well. I mean, this guy got in trouble, but I feel like these guys kind of goofed up even worse because, well, I'll, I'll this, he's in a canoe. Okay. For Christ's sake. I love him. The guy next door just like, what the hell are we doing? Every time it rains hard and there's someone walking by ankle, ankle high, I really cut out quick, but the next one's as good as against here and let's pull this one out. Ready? They get a kind of new,

Speaker 4:          00:57:01       they brought it in. The northeast is more rain, continues to fall today and be c's, Michelle Kosinski and a coo. She's in a new way. New Jersey this morning. Michelle, good morning to you. She's got a paddle, she's paddling in her canoe is there, we're getting a nice break from the rain but not the flooding.

Speaker 2:          00:57:17       And somebody would literally walk two guys who are like fuck this lady walk right in front of her. And it's just at ankle depth. And what I love about the reporters is they call her out so great over in this neighborhood. Don't try to say, well she was standing on a shoe stands, grassy water. Would they uh, there was a deep point, deep point,

Speaker 4:          00:57:42       well canoe or boat when you're out in it as much deeper back here because this actually Michelle, I'll take it. Is there some kind of severe drop off there between the floor? Go back. This guy's a second shall walk in. Are these holy men walking on top of you guys when you have a ride like this, why would you want to walk? You run a short, you know, it's funny. All

Speaker 2:          00:58:06       the producers are probably in on it and they just tossed her ass bus hard. By the way, shout out to Matt Lauer who actually had a button and is this is Matt Lauer? Yeah, the button guy. He hit a button in his office. He got me to his stories. One of my favorites. He gave him, he me to it. He didn't get me to it. Right. That's the term he got me to code. He toured. He too. Yeah, he too. So He's, he's is one of my favorite c and this is crazy. He had a button installed under his dad. So when people are female interns or whatever came into his office, he had a button, he would push that lock the fucking door behind them. Oh, how do you even think about that? That's like Dr Evil Shit. A button that locks the door from the outside.

Speaker 2:          00:59:05       Anyway, good shout out to Matt Lauer. How did they even explain that when he was like ordering it? You know like what do you put on the work order? Just put it on that. What other men budget? They got all that. They'll get out of their special effects budget. Yeah, deep water because they weren't. All right, I'm going to need a button. Okay. Now what this button does is it locks the door from the outside so I can really focus and get some work done. Right now. Well now it's for me to be able to focus, but just hypothetically, if somebody wanted to get out, they have to push this button under my desk to get out. Now that's just to make sure that I can focus all the way that I need to. Five years dreams, piece of video there, Michelle, or hitting ground Michelle, of course. I wonder if he ever pushed the button on her. You know what I mean? Michelle? We stepped into my office.

Speaker 2:          01:00:17       talk to me and it turns out he did not install it. It was a mechanism that was a standard feature in many of the older offices. That was like the whole story. You're debunking that. Yeah. Well what was the story? What did he get in trouble for them?

Speaker 7:          01:00:34       Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:00:34       well it's more about the, I think the actual personally yeah, he raped somebody. No, I don't know what he did, but sexual misconduct whenever there's allegations, but people were wondering about that if he installed it personally. Okay. So he did it. That's just standard issue for sit back in the fifties yeah, that was just standard. It make it better. Um, okay. Now moving on. Hmm. Shout out to Matt Lauer. Hope he's doing good. Wherever he is.

Speaker 2:          01:07:50       it's generally one person is way out of the other person's league. Yeah. And one person who is wade delusional and one person has the opportunity to give the other person where the League of Isa. Okay. You guys get the fucking idea. Um, oh yeah. Guys, if you have any questions or you want our opinion on something, you want to show us something. You want me to talk something, email us. I want to start answering emails every episode. So email us@podcastaththreehthreeproductions.com. What else we got? Um, yes, some thing I've got the fat shaming fashion revolve the drop. Yeah. There's a company called revolve, which is a fashion company that teamed up with Lena Dunham. Actually, I don't know what Lena Dunham and thought. So she comedian, I just hear a name all the time. Oh, she's a writer. Um, at any rate, she worked on a collaboration with this company and it's a female empowerment colab. So the idea behind it was that they wanted to make clothes that, you know, promoted body positivity. So with that in mind, let me show you what the final product was. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:09:21       so here you go. Oh, I can't, I can't expand it. That fun. Sometimes it does what? It does, it definitely his fault. Why is that? So just zooming on the page. Usually when you click it, it just pops out. That's, sorry, let me try refresh it. Well, any, oh man, that's kind of annoying. Dad Page can write. Try right clicking it and view image. I'm not doing that. So, um, here's a beautiful skinny model that says two bony to be bombed. So the idea was that they took quotes, hurtful quotes, and they used it as armor to be like, Hey, your words don't hurt me. So horrible result of modern feminism.

Speaker 5:          01:10:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:10:14       Slut feminist nightmare to bind to be bond. If you translated a bomb onto her face, she'd have a better faith. And of course here again, being fat is not beautiful. It's an excuse. Imagine that one is the worst [inaudible] girl that imagine wearing that. So people look at this $170 being fat is not bad if fall, it's an excuse. Like Oh, fit. Yeah. Oh, so they missed the mark so much what happened here? Clearly I guess they meant the heavy, heavier size. Yeah. You know, it's still a weird shirt if I'm being honest. It is. But this combination or are small, right? You cannot tell that it's a quote. Yeah. But either way, the beautiful fit model was just a, so people got so upset and everyone wants the Xing, apologies and whatever, whatever. To me, this image really just is what I love so much. Being fat is not beautiful. It's an excuse I earned 70 bucks. So thank you to Lena Dunham and um, we've all revolve for this collaboration. How we manage. This is a really crazy on how we mendo

Speaker 2:          01:11:53       tell us Tyra Bank live on America's got talent that she has fake hair. Now I guess this is a somewhat common thing of, of females, I guess black females have a lot of them have fake hair weave. We watch a whole documentary the Chris rock made called like good hair or something. It was really interesting because I don't think he made it. Yeah, I think it was Chris Rock. Hmm. And I didn't actually know this was a thing, but a lot of black women have fake hair like from India. So their hair, they have like tiny little corn, corn rows and then they weave real hair of like straight or wavy hair and they have like really elaborate weaves. Apparently you're not supposed to touch a black woman's hair. Actually, even a lot of white women have extensions now. So extensions. Yeah. No, it's crazy. Like extensions, like I've seen it where you take the extensions out and it's just like three times as much volume. It's like, what the hell? I don't really personally care that much about the whole hair thing, but the hey, women want to feel beautiful. They want to do their thing and got in Boston anyway, how we apparently knows because they spend a lot of time backstage together. The tyra has fake hair and so that probably is what makes us even more embarrassing. So let us enjoy

Speaker 4:          01:13:23       the facial hair. How does it feel with all that fake hair on yourself? I don't have no idea what that feels like. I don't care. That wasn't a fake. That was his real hair. Oh, I see what you did. You see what she did? No, she has fake hair. It's a Joe Walsh.

Speaker 2:          01:13:42       It's so bad. Huh? He genuinely thinks that she's setting them up for like a, a gag. I don't know. It was he thinking and is just really trying to make a joke, but it was so bad. Well, she said, I have no idea what it feels like. That fake hair. Yeah. And so he was like making a joke, I think. No, but then I think he really was like, oh my God, what did I say here? I'm in here watching.

Speaker 4:          01:14:08       She thinks it's a joke. It's okay. Okay. I wasn't talking about her head. You were like, yeah, I do. I guess it's going. This is live TV. Okay, we're moving on. I know we have to move on. Isn't this discussing? Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:14:27       Ooh. Tyra is not happy. Yeah, I mean it's, I mean, Shit.

Speaker 4:          01:14:37       I gotta watch that again. Talking about her head. That was an awful site, by the way, has fake hair. It's a joke

Speaker 2:          01:14:46       that, that this was real when he's like, Whoa, Shit. Right. In real. What do you mean? Well, cause he was like, oh, I shouldn't have said that. Yeah. Of them.

Speaker 4:          01:14:56       No, it's okay.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       I think he was trying to make a joke, but it was really the one wrong. So tyra has fake hair, to be honest. I wouldn't have guessed it because usually you can see it in the forehead. I don't know. That's a really good weaver. She's rich. She got that crazy fucking weeps. Yeah. You don't want it to be noticeable. Sure. But it's pretty, I mean, well, so what the hell does it look like when she takes her hair off? Oh, no, you don't know about it. I don't think you'd take it off. I don't warn you when you go through there Barbara, you keep it on all the time. Yeah. And they fix it up. You guys should watch this documentary. Good hair by Chris rock is really interesting. Um, Tara, how are we fascinating stuff guys. We've got great content here on the h street podcast and you don't ever want to miss a single episode because, uh, you just don't know what's coming next and that radio. Yup. We don't even know what's coming next. Nobody knows. Guys, have you seen this? Um, Joey Salads? This is kind of a, I don't know this, I don't know when it's from, but I love this. I am.

What you're going to say about it? I got to say it's just stupid. Youtube stupid. Yeah, exactly. Because everybody who has something bad to say about you on the call. If I see him in person, of course I will. Of course I will because yeah, and your boys not going to help you. I'm serious, I'll beat your fucking ass with my right hand while I'm talking with my left. And it's not petty. You fucking disrespected my mother and you don't disrespect it. Well maybe in this country you can. Not In fucking Russia. Did I disrespect your mother? I didn't need it to heat disrespectful. You said you weren't.

Speaker 2:          01:18:34       And Joey does tend to think that whatever he does on youtube doesn't mean anything. Like a fake black lives matter. Trump car experiment. He's missing. I Dunno. Oh my God. Look at this picture of a tally. Let me pull this up. Villain Rocky or Dragon Ball Z. Seriously look like man. He looks like a suit. Like,

Speaker 5:          01:19:06       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:19:07       Ivan Drago and that's the, that's the guy from rocky. I mean he looks like he's on his way to shoot a gay porn. And I mean, I don't mean to say like this is like,

Speaker 5:          01:19:15       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:19:16       I mean he's got the bleached tips. It's got the pink top

Speaker 2:          01:19:22       there. You went to the muscles Ila. I actually am not at all. Thank God not to this level. I don't. What is the, what's the good amount of muscle for you? Well there's some in his new vlog where you were pointing out to me are today were his big driving his car and his dear friend is recording from the side and his arm. He's like taking up the whole screen. What is that? I just, I get the feeling like when dudes get this jacked, they do it for each other. I don't think that many women like that's why I like trying to say bar women with all the surgeries. I felt like it becomes like a competition between themselves and I don't even think of the guys even care. No, I think so. Like of course like a jack do with like a six pack is attractive and looks good and you like that. But like at what point like here at Dan just sent me this photo. Like when you get like Mister Universe jacked, I feel like that's just the dude. There's nothing wrong with him in the before picture.

Speaker 2:          01:20:29       Okay, that's great. You're not, you're an everyday man girl. Um, but at any rate, I just, I saw him, he's like working out with all of his dudes and they're all getting like jacked as fuck and they're all like checking each other out and they're all like, almost naked. I was like, this is gay. There's nothing wrong with that. But like this looks like, you know, God bless some, maybe you'll find out something new that is into something funny about that. Just a bunch of naked dudes lifting boy boyfriend joke had joe. You're right. He was like, you and your boyfriend here, Joey. Is that what he said? I think, hey joey, they might make a good couple. I think they can make some really good prank together. And you know, Joe, he's no stranger to two gay porn. He had a whole tumblr page for gay men.

Speaker 2:          01:21:21       I don't know if you guys know that. He had this whole thing where he's putting his dick in a hot dog bun and putting like mustard on it. And his roommate was recording it and they started putting it on tumbler and they had a whole huge following. Oh my God. It's news to me. Beautiful following of a gay men following him. Yeah. And I think at one point he just got, he was like, what am I doing? Any ratio is a real variety man. Yeah. And I'll tell you, and let me say something about Joey, when he was any here, I shook his hand. He has the softest fucking hand lotion. Like Bro, I touched his hand and I was like, what is your hands? So Sasha and himself before he can't go, I don't know. You know, you know, do your thing and nothing wrong with that.

Speaker 2:          01:22:16       I was gay. I would suck so much dick like you. Would you choose vitale or joey to would I fuck. Wow. That's a fun, that's a tough one. Well I know vitaly can't even get it up from the big bucks. That is Joe. He seems like he has a sweet thought. If I'm being honest, the tally seems totally unhinged and insane. Joey, he seems to have a sweet soul and you know those soft hands would, would be, would have me here in a split second. So you're more of a personality I think. Joey, I think I'll go with jelly all day. Joe, if you're listening, Jerry's going to cut part and upload it to his channel. H three wants to date. Joey. Stop. Yeah. I want to fuck Joe. I put your Dick in a hot dog bun and a damn split. The damn second guys, we have the best content here.

Speaker 2:          01:23:15       Do we not? What else? Goop. You guys heard about, oh, you know goop. We always make fun of goop when we do like quick reads cause they say it's an oprah is leads in goop and I was like, what the fuck is goop? Goop? Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress owns this magazine called Coop and actually we've spoke about in a magazine style. It's a multimillion company lost. First of all it's like what kind of name is goop? Apparently she has her initials, Gwyneth Paltrow, GP, and she's like, I wanted a name that meant everything and anything and nothing. I was like, goop is a pretty literal, that's just like a sound of like, yeah, it's like it's gross. It's like when you take a shit when shit comes out of your ass, goop like that. Sound effect. You keep playing. It's kind of pretty goopy type of a good.

Speaker 2:          01:24:09       So anyway, we spoke briefly about goop before because they got in trouble for selling stickers that were apparently and fused with NASA technology to increase your energy level. And that's the total scheme. What the fuck? But now they're back. They're being sued again because they have vaginal eggs. Uh, jade eggs that you insert in your vagina. Fantastic stuff. Let me pull up some pictures that are appropriate for everyone. You know, I was more fascinated by this, this egg. Um, I don't want you to see this photo because it's really graphic. Well, here, let me show you this. So it's like an egg that you shove up your badge and you keep it there like all day. It's crazy. What do you think about that? I mean, I don't have you here. I'll read it, I'll read it. I'll tell you all about it. That was very uncomfortable. Um, here I've got the whole, I got the low down here. So here there's a picture of, basically it's a drawing, but I don't want to show it. But you, you, you, you know what to do. You know what? You put it up there. I'm like a Tampon I guess, but except the giant stone.

Speaker 2:          01:25:28       Um, from Kegels to vaginal steaming. We're not shy here at goop. Apparently not. Apparently don't think much either. We don't think much here at goop. Why not? I love this. They call it a strictly guarded secret of Chinese royalty, queens and concubines. Use them to stay in shape for emperors. Jade eggs were said to harness the power of energy work and crystal healing. Shivah rose has been working with them for about seven years and raves about the results. Jade Aix power to cleanse and clear make them ideal for spiritual detox. Hmm. You still have any questions that does that explain everything I'm jade eggs can help cultivate sexual energy. Clear Ci, uh, yeah, cultivating, intensify it and femininity and invigorate our life force just to name a few. It's a holistic combination of things where one benefits builds to another. Jade also takes away negative energy. It's a very heavy material and incidentally it just shoves really easily run up to your fucking badge hole.

Speaker 2:          01:26:47       That's folder for them to write. Um, they did not. Anyway, this shit's hilarious. I'm bummed it was just, that all sounds great. You can try it, bro. I got anal egg still works and stomping is right. Um, how do we start and when you first get your egg, boil it right. It's a sacred space. They'll make sure plane for me it's about physical cleaner. You could put it under the light of a full moon, the clench or recharge it. Oh my God. What the fuck? Or You could burn sage. The egg does absorb energy. So I like how they go from NASA energy to Chinese, I dunno, uh, Chinese secrets. You know what goop is? It's the sound that at jade egg makes when a plops out of your vege. Uh, before I insert an egg, I'll do our ritual. I'll place it on a beautiful piece of fabric, light a candle, and then shove it up my fucking nasty snatch for my ritual.

Speaker 2:          01:27:49       I'll imagine pure light flowing from my nasty snatch and shove an egg in there who really expensive that's supposedly likes, I don't know anything it's due. There's somewhere in there. No, no, it's some, it's some lady, one of their editors I would assume always rapped the egg and sell, keep it clean and start on an altar on the why. It should take a sacred place in your life and alter does that, it's like a sacred podium and an egg gets stuck or lost? Good question. I don't a good question. This is the most common question we get and no, it cannot get lost. Depending on the size of your cabin or as cavernous giant vege it could get lost for a couple of weeks depending on, on uh, how fast your vagina is. No, they say no it cannot get lost. What about stock? But there are ones that have a toll drilled in them so that you can bungy in and splunk into her vagina and follow the lifeline to the egg.

Speaker 2:          01:29:00       Now you can put a through the egg and to make it easy to take out. Like way. If you were to spelunk into a cavern, know it's spelunking is that's cave diving. Yeah, I remember that from the prank conversion spelunking away. Are there people who should not use jade eggs? Very good question. If you're on your cycle, do not use it out of people. If you're pregnant, do not shove that egg in there. Okay? A man, if you have a function and brain, do not shove it in I yeah, exactly. People will functioning bridge to not use jade egg. So there it is. So what happened is that uh, so what happened was that they're being sued for basically making unsubstantiated, unscientific, untested claims. Basically everything I just read people like less bullshit. You cannot say that. And they came into a and they're being sued for it. Oh Man. Oh they did. So yeah. Why are you so familiar? Because they paid one 50. Oh, they lost 145,000 so there you go. I'm more, I'm just more interested in the egg itself. That product is incredible. How much is it? It's like $70 70 bucks. Not Bad for a not bad for a a rock that you shove up your fucking ass hole.

Speaker 7:          01:30:29       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:30:32       It's nine to santee Iraq. I got a couple of rocks. If you guys want for 60 bucks, you can shove up your house or they jade or the recharge by the energy of the moon. Yes. Oh fuck yeah. I'll bet there's another headline. Fortnight has been said it and more than 200 divorce proceedings. That's it. There's really nothing more than that. And finally guys, we do have an email. If you guys have emails, questions, concerns, you want to hear us talk about something, make sure to email podcast@hdhdproductions.com I have got an email to close up the show today from a sweet young man named Daniel. Now, Daniel, like many of you out there are young men, impressionable minds who are looking for answers and better ways to live, a more holistic, a natural life. And he heard our discussion mine and um, burt's about wiping, how we wipe from the front that we march to the beat of our own. What we marched, we marched from the front. Others, they wiped from the back. The normal. Well, normal is a subjective term, Mila. And I want him to go that far. I say a normal man. The Standard Pazi body positivity.

Speaker 2:          01:31:52       So I'm going to read this email. I thought it was a great email and I wanted to share it with all you guys and, and it really, and it created a new dimension on this whole conversation about front wiping verse back, wiping something that I had, which was an unintended consequence, but a wonderful consequence of it. So, um, let me begin here. Dear Ethan, for 25 years, I have been a back wiping neanderthal. Today I am proud to say that I have thrown in the toilet paper and have committed to front wiping moving forward. I was first introduced to front wiping in high school when a participant on a reality show reveal to his peers that he wiped from the front. I like the other people on the show was disgusted by the thought of it. It garnered the typical reaction that most unenlightened people have where they imagined smearing feces up their ball sack.

Speaker 2:          01:32:53       Out of my own curiosity, I tried it one day and confirm my own suspicion that it wasn't insufficient way of cleaning my ass. And due to my naivety, however, oh due to my own naivety, however, I now realize I was doing it incorrectly by converting my own stand up, back wiping technique to a front style that was wildly uncomfortable. Fast forward 10 years later and a big fan of your show, I was disappointed to be faced with the issue. Once again, you spoke with Tom Sikora and Chris Delea. I found myself disagreeing with you as I had an already settled this debate myself as a teenager. It was not until your episode with Bert Kreischer that I was willing to give front what being a second chance when I learned that you remain seated through the experience, I realized I had made a mistake in my past experience. Then something that either you or bird said really clicked with me. It does not make sense to wipe a whole. It needs to be a scoop in order to clean and I do believe that was after this, I was reading in three Coupe Ila please. We're talking about scooping. This is personal and spiritual.

Speaker 2:          01:34:11       After this I was ready to truly open myself to change and why I'm wiping technique. While it felt a bit weird at first, I have been blown away by the results. First off, it is more natural reach as opposed to the awkward and standing up and reaching backwards. You don't need to stand up. I stay seated. A lot of people stand up. You guys back there? Do you stand up when you wipe from the back? Uh, it's more of like a, a slight lift and you left. You left. Well, it's still technically seated. I'd say somewhere in between. It's a lift. A lot of standalone wipe again can I didn't get, I, I, this is emotional. This is important to me. First off, it is more natural reach as opposed to the awkward standup and reaching backwards. Secondly, I'm able to perform a quick couple of scoop scoop.

Speaker 2:          01:35:05       It's what he Rowan's when I said, God damn it. This is the truth as opposed to a rough wipe that only makes the task harder as you smear shit up your ass crack. And lastly, I'm able to finish in less wipes with a cleaner result. I just wanted to thank you for your continued efforts. If you are truly the Nelson Nelson Mandela of wiping, and I feel as if I am not the only person to be converted by your wisdom. I had doubts about this technique for a decade and I can only think about all the wasted time I've spent using an insufficient, inefficient wiping motion. I recommend all back wipers give it one week trial because the result is truly life changing. Thank you're sincerely. 10:00 PM I do not use baby wipes. I've heard nothing but horror stories about the dam. Okay, and now, Yay. You had me until you started talking shit on baby wipes, Daniel. But you know I really wonderful. I think I was moved because I was never my intention to convert anyone ever thought it was my, as a misunderstood soul, a victim of my own excess of wiping. But I hope that it doesn't switch back once he understands that it doesn't need to stand up to wipe from the Mac did. It's been wiping his ass his whole life. He knows what he's doing.

Speaker 2:          01:36:38       Um, interestingly, Zack, I just heard our sound guy, he's our sound intern. He's helping us out with sound. Um, he told me today that he in his house, they don't even have toilet paper. They go pure wet wipe, which I've never thin. I've never seen that. And frankly I find it a little strange because I would never, I would never recommend a start wet because that's just asking for trouble. I recommend to Zach and to all anyone else out there, you have to take a hybrid approach because you want to start try and what? So Zach, welcome aboard. Pretty strange. Zach, do you wipe from the front or the back? Can you talk into the mic method? You serious? Whoa. First I was doing before, but I tried it out and I happen to really like it. Wait, are you fucking kidding me? You're just saying that you want me to bend over and yeah, I don't know what that would prove.

Speaker 2:          01:37:44       I'm a cleat. Wait, wait, Whoa, wait, let me get this straight. Zach, are you just saying this to get the job right here or something? He wouldn't lie about this. He wouldn't lie about this. He'll, that's embarrassing. It is very embarrassing. But baby wipes and let me tell you, save your life. Hold on, hold on. Hold on. Backup, backup, backup, backup. Hang on. You're telling me that you wiped from the bat until you heard this show and then based on my anecdote, you decided to lift your own balls and Dick and one hand reach under them and scoop out the shit from the front. 100% I cannot remember. And you prefer it? I do prefer, yes.

Speaker 2:          01:38:30       Wait and wait. And Ian is a front in. I don't know that we've ever asked you and where, where do you wipe from it? I think we did from the front seat. And then then you're in back white boy. Hold on. Wait, Dan is the odd man out here for one. And then have you always wiped from the front? No, I converted probably a high school. Oh, why did you convert? What makes you say to yourself in the middle of your life that you're going to start lifting up your dick and balls and scooping out shit from underneath it? I didn't know that that was possible. And then I think someone in a show set it and I went, what? That's madness. I tried it and I never went back. And you think it's superior? Absolutely bogus.

Speaker 2:          01:39:16       Truly a profit. I'd been saying, have you tried it now? They know I did. Yes. No, I gave it. I gave it an honest go coop. No, there was some stupid, I mean, no, I, I, I, I want it to be objective. You know, I am like, it. Go into it without bias. Didn't like it. Didn't like it. Now Dan, tell me what you were sitting on the John, right. And generally where I did my business, but I just want to make sure you did the technique right. And then what? Which hand did you wipe with? Oh, well I'm a righty. So with the, you lifted your balls and deck with your left hand, you remained seated a yes. And then you went in with the right hand in under underhanded, underhanded technique. Yeah, that's how you do it. I know, I think I nailed it.

Speaker 2:          01:39:58       I think I nailed the technique and then just, I'm not a fan. You may need to try it to the group mix. Make an egg in there. I'm down for that for sure. Chuck. Chris. Well, I have to tell you, this was an eye opening. This whole saga, not only with sac, a recent convert at that Ian Independent and Ian, he's a talented young man. He'd say, tell he's got a good head on his shoulders and high school. He said to himself, there's gotta be a better way. And he was converted from that first scoop. And I find that powerful. We just found out two conversions in one week. Wow. Who says he's amazing work here. Important word, incredible stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:40:41       And I thought that we were just talking here, wasting everyone's time. No evil. How many people are going to front scoop tonight? Let us know. Send us an email, send us your thoughts podcast, we productions.com. All right, well, uh, today is Friday. We've got, oh KSI on Tuesday. It'll be exciting. We'll go to lots of tall. No we didn't. So case size on Tuesday. That's our episode next week. I'm working on the h three video. Hopefully will be out this weekend. I don't know. Who knows? We'll see. I'll do my best with that all being said. How'd we do today? We did solid. However the numbers chuckles back here. I think the numbers are low because I heard people say it wasn't showing up. Yeah. I apologize to anybody that didn't get the notification. I mean eyes that I got it on my phone. Um, but yeah, I guess in the tweet I saw some responses that people were having trouble finding the episode today.

Speaker 2:          01:41:44       So we will, we will investigate, maybe emailed the, our context that, um, even when I went to our podcast channel, you know, we'll usually show there and doing the show. I have to click on the video. Lee, what the hell you to, enough people found that cause we're at like 17,000 now. Ultimately it did well. But, um, but yeah, anybody that, uh, I got screwed by that and we apologize to find that strange. I wonder if there's a thing in the settings we fucked up or not likely just say youtube bug. I think it's gotta be, cause again, I did get it. I mean I got all the notes. Look and we have a contact. We can email it. Youtube, right? Yeah. Yeah. We'll, we'll reach out. We'll figure out what happened. Oh Man. You gotta Love Youtube. It's like never know what you're going to get. Imagine being like NBC and you're like new episode of Seinfeld. Maybe half of the People's TV's don't turn on half a half of everybody just gets scrambled waves when they turn on NBC imagined. All right guys. Have a great weekend. The morals of bad science Tuesday and that'd be it for this week. Hey guys. All right. Is this, it is Friday, right? It's Friday. Well, what do we have to do was so mixed up lately. I don't know the week. Friday. Tomorrow we've got dinner. Yeah. Sound Dave. We've got dinner. Dad's birthday. Oh yeah. My Dad's birthday. We're going to take him out Monday. We've got shit to do.
