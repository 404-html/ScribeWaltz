Speaker 2:          00:00:28       Yep. Then billing yet not so close though, right? It's like 9.9 I mean, you just hit 20 million, right? Yeah, like four days ago. That's pretty insane. Like 20 that's so fun. I know. And every time it's like you, you hear the numbers go up and up and up. And then it was like, I wrote it out to somebody in like 20 minutes as a lot of zero fucking weird. I Dunno. Why? How does it mean? Do you ever expect like, okay, it's going to slow down now? Yeah. I think everyone kind of expected. Yeah. They're like, all right, it's going to slow down. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I would think. Okay. That's probably, it never stopped. Let's go on up there. I don't know. I don't want to have a wire tap it in somewhere. I have a secret upload button that gets more subscribers or something.

Speaker 2:          00:01:12       I Dunno. Damn. That's crazy. Um, well, anyway, welcome to Los Angeles. Thank you. A good Irish boy. Yeah. I haven't burst into flames yet. It's not yet. It'll happen. I mean, you're, I guess that's a joke about you being pale I soon, yes. They're not that pill. No, it's not. That bad situation is not that bad. It's pretty fucking bad. I mean, my, well yeah, it's been here a long time where you just fail. I made, while frank laid don't, I mean, look, I don't leave the house. You don't have to go in the sun out here. That's true. I mean, yeah. And if he doesn't penetrate my roof, that's, that's the problem with La. You go outside, you die or you get stuck in traffic. So, uh, by the way, do you live in Ireland or do you live in the UK? Where do you live right now?

Speaker 2:          00:01:56       I lived in Ireland until last year, then I moved to Brighton. So I've been living there for a year since May. That's where pewter pilots, right? Yeah. You guys, you guys hang out. You guys grab yours, hang out, make out all the time. No, it's weird cause we, we live in the same town and he's like a 30 minute drive for me. Oh yeah. Almost never see each other. 30 minutes is like five minutes. Best friends, 30 minutes and I'll talk to you. So yeah, we'll see. She was like once a month maybe. Yeah. Although it's kind of close like 30 minutes. That's pretty close. Same time. It's also like I'll see you next year and then I've been doing tour stuff and everything and he has his own stuff that's going on so we never like find the right time. Why'd you move to a brighton? Um, I mean it was kind of moves.

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       I wanted to move anyway and I thought, well why am I going to move to la? That seems a bit far. It's just a lot going on there. I have a lot to figure out. And I was like, well I could have moved to London but that's too hectic. I don't really like London to live. I was like, oh Brighton. I went to visit Felix and fell in love with it. Seems like a nice little spot. Yeah. It's literally out on the beach. Nice and cozy. People there are nice. You go to the beach? Not really because it's not a real beach. It's like a pebble goes all the time. Yeah. You never really have the weather while La Kinda has the same problem. It's like come to la for the beaches but never go in it because of the water is so cold all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:03:14       Have you been at the beach here in la? No. I pull it down off the beach. Shit. Yeah. Don't bother about it so far away. I don't want to, don't worry about it. Don't leave the house. Don't go to the beach. La is great. Yeah, it's lovely. Make a lot of friends. What brings you out to la? Cause you came out here on an extended trip, right? Like you're out here for a couple months. You kind of escaping a little bit. Would you say getting out here and kind of just, hey my life you a little way of life. I wanted to become a movie actor. Really reach Hollywood. No, I was like, I don't know too much shit. Yeah. That's how long it takes. Yeah. Four years. I'll see you on TV somewhere. I Dunno. I kind of, I've always wanted to come for a while and every time I come here like we've been trying to do this for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       I remember when you started off you're like, you should do it. Yeah. That was in town for like a week and nothing ever lined up ever. Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah. So it was like come for a month or two. I have a visa for tour anyway when the phone and abused that and stay here for a while and hang out with friends for a longer period of time. And then it was supposed to be until August and then tour leaves in August and I was going to go back afterwards and then my visa got extended so I can technically stay here longer, so nice. Why not? I don't need to be back home in Brighton for anything anytime soon. So just hang out here and do cool stuff. But you, I mean you've been talking a lot about being burned out and taking a break from your panel.

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       Is that kind of is coming out to la almost like therapeutic kind of get away from the life back there. Yeah. Which is weird cause I said that I needed a break and I was getting burned out and I just needed to figure out what I wanted to do and everyone's was like, La is not the place to go find yourself out. Disagree by the way. Really I feel like La gets a bad rep. Yeah. I love that La is, this is a huge metropolis, one of the biggest, I mean per square miles, it's enormous. There's so many different communities and different you can be and do whatever you want here. I don't know why everyone has such a bad perception of La la. Yeah. I don't know why I agree with doing well anyway, so, but I mean you are in a sense kind of, I mean you out here kind of just trying to figure things out or is it more just, you know, coincidental.

Speaker 2:          00:05:19       Yeah, what bit of both. Yeah, I was, I was just got really miserable doing the types of videos I was doing after awhile. It was like a whole month where I was like, this is crap. Like I'm uploading Shit just for the sake of uploading. And I was so stringent on my schedule and I was so proud of that schedule. It was like, I don't want to break that. But your fans could they tell? Yeah. So that, that was what made me do it cause they, they started being able to see it and I was like, well if I'm not enjoying it, you're not enjoying it. What kind of comments would they say where you were like, oh shit. Like maybe just like a, I didn't seem happy. I don't have the energy I normally had. I looked sad, I looked tired, which I fully agreed with.

Speaker 2:          00:05:53       I was, and then it just came to a point where it's like, okay, yeah, I need to, and I was coming here anyways, so I was like, okay, I'll on the way to la, I'll just take a week off. I've never ever taken any time off of youtube and the five years I've been doing it, so I was like, okay, full break. No Youtube, no twitter, no tumbler, no instagram, no none of that. And I decided would just spend a week of my own and it was great. I got here and hung out with friends. Completely changed my mind again. You feeling better? Oh, 100% I'm completely one 80 done where I was. You feeling like motivated to, but are you, are you afraid? Like if you get back into it, you almost fall back into it? Because that was my problem was like I've been through that same exact thing.

Speaker 2:          00:06:33       I mean I don't have a crazy upload schedule like you were, you were doing two videos the day for a long time. Five years, but then you went, you started doing one a day recently or, yeah, whenever I'd have to go out and tour or something. I kind of bump it down, but it was still like, can you still wore, I'm still working. I remember seeing you in New York a couple, couple of years ago. [inaudible] 16 yeah, it was a long ass time ago. And, and you and Felix and mark were there and I was like, you're like, oh yeah, we all made videos ahead of time and they're all scheduled the upload. I was like, what?

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       I mean that's just fuck. That's just twisted. Like there's something fucked up about this job in particular. Yeah. Right. I mean to be fair, my stuff is a lot easier to do than the ones you did. Yeah. But still let's, I mean you're still making two videos a day. Okay. And you still under the same expectation, your fans have expectations, you have expectations of yourself. I mean our, our approach is different, but the consumption of time and the expectation is the same. Yeah. I think that's fair. But like this job seems particularly fucked up, right? Like what is it about, because everyone was talking about this thing of like burnout, right? Youtube or burnout. That's really big right now. Everyone's so aware. We haven't posted a video where we are in the middle of burnout. I would say for all, I'm fully burnt out. Like there's no wax left in the camp.

Speaker 2:          00:07:58       I'm new canvas. I'm taking out a new candle. I Dunno, like handle smell like lavender jasmine. No, not those are the lavender is flowing in it. Um, yeah. I need a new essence. What's going on? Why? Why is being a Youtuber so fucked up? It's rolled psychopaths. I Dunno. I think it's because you started it cause you love it and then it becomes your job and then you have an audience and people to take care of and you want to do the best you can and it's just a platform and a job that you, you're not really allowed take time allowed. You can do whatever the fuck you want. Right. But it's just not in your best interest to do it. And no one's, you don't, you're your own boss. You make your own hours, you make your own schedules and then it's the curse I think. Yeah. And now it's just, youtube is just in such a weird place anyway with all the shit that's been happening over the last year or two years and now they're trying to diversify their streams and everything. So everyone just feels like on that treadmill more than ever. I think. Right and then it's just coming to a head and then one person talks about it. It would sperms another person to talk about it and then 10 other people start talking about it on our, everyone's able to talk about that.

Speaker 3:          00:09:07       I think part of the problem too, I think everything you said is exactly right. It's like when you're your own boss and when you're involved in something as,

Speaker 4:          00:09:16       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:09:16       I mean I want to say toxic but that's not specific. It's just so like you're on the treadmill, you're on the hamster wheel and it just like you got to keep the machine rolling.

Speaker 2:          00:09:26       Yeah, and the, the mentalities on youtube have changed a lot over the years. Like three years ago at the gaming scene was all collaborative all the time. It was in your best interest to collab with people in like beauty gurus and everybody would be doing it to now no one doesn't because everyone's afraid of stepping on each other's toes. Everyone wants to insulate their own brand and build it as far as they can and everything gets very, I was self involved

Speaker 3:          00:09:48       I think I was going to say is that I think now it's more competitive because like, I mean if you ask an average 10 year old what their dream job is, everyone wants to be a utuber. Yeah. And it's like so competitive and it's so hard to become to, you know, earn a living on Youtube. I'm a big youtuber that I think that's part of what's so toxic. Yeah. About what it's become. But you're definitely right. I mean it's just not,

Speaker 2:          00:10:12       and we can all see each others. We can't see what each other makes. But if you make a certain amount of view is like somebody else, you kind of know what everybody's makings or every youtuber kind of knows what if your subs, you can see your views, you can see your like how interested people that are the comments. Everybody's just like, well mine's better than yours. And then if your yours isn't better than than, than you do some weird shit to try and get it to be better than somebody else. And it's a lot of like, it's not, it's not friendly rivalry anymore. I don't think there's, okay. So if somebody uploads something, you think it's cool so you like want to do better. Now it's a case of like I can fucking do better than that and you try and shit all over somebody else. That's that. That's what I feel like youtube at large is now everyone's trying to be better than each other in that way.

Speaker 4:          00:10:53       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       I guess whatever came became popular, you're like, I swear I feel like I in some way has played a role in that. I do so because like I feel like when we first started coming up popular on Youtube, it was from reaction videos and like shitting on people and just like, I mean, you know, choose your target wisely, but like you, you bay, I mean our early videos, we're just really shitting on people. I mean, and I think that we did collaborate with people to know. I know, but like, um, I don't, I'm not going to say that I'm like wholly responsible for like this trend of like cometary channels, which are basically just solely, almost talking shit on other creators. But like, it's definitely a fad that came up around the time we started doing it. We helped popularize it. I can say it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:43       Well, that's what I'm saying. Like you guys started off and you, whatever way you perceive it, but you picked your targets property, you pick people that you felt like were valid in criticism. You're not shitting on someone. That's just the entertainment factor of it. Yeah. It's like, it's a bit more embellished than it would be, but then like I said, somebody else sees that and they want to do something better and they want to do something crazier and get more views than you. So then they end up just shitting on people. Yeah. And then it becomes a thing. It's like, like, like there's like, I see this, I see this a lot where it's just really popular content on youtube right now is like, it's easy to shit on someone who's being, you know, being creative. And maybe it's not your style. Maybe it's not a video like, and so it's so, it's so easy and people do this and people love watching it being like, this person's not funny.

Speaker 2:          00:12:29       Yeah. And it's like, wow, they're making something original and you're just fucking shitting on them for that. Yeah. I Dunno. Maybe I'm just, my mentality is changing, but I see that a lot on youtube and it's like the people who are trying to be creative and actually put themselves out there, it's so scary to put yourself out there on Youtube these days and be authentic and try to be creative and original because there's so many fucking, there's so many people waiting to just eat you alive for as like you're not doing anything wrong. You might be unfunny and my opinion, but like what do I have to flush her trying, yeah, I'm going to shit on you for being an unfunny. Plus the youtube audiences have just changed now. It's like they all do that now. Um, it's very rare to have a community where everyone is actually positive all the time because you're not, you're not an up and comer anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:13:13       It's not a new job to do anymore. You're not the underdog anymore. Everyone, there's more money involved in youtube now within the river husband, and I think the audience are very keenly aware of that and that they want to poke at people because they feel like it's easier to do. It's like, well, they have money. It's just a matter of, if I say shit to them, yeah. It's like, well, we're still people at the end of the day. Oh, I have. I mean, it's definitely a big part of it. Anything, yeah, so it's just a whole bunch of building blocks to where it is. That makes a difference too on the burnout because like you, everybody, even the people who talk shit on say like, oh, this one's not funny. That's all their videos. They're going to be more stressed out because they're afraid that they're fucking coat. They're know colleagues.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       They're going to call them out for fucking up and everybody's walking on eggshells because it's just like a giant mud slinging contest these days on, I mean we went through a huge spreadsheet of like drama and community and reactions and everything. Like that circle just went around and around for like a whole year and then I think that just fundamentally changed everything after that Bro. It's like communist Russia so that chopping block good and get dragged out in the middle of the night. It's human nature. Everyone wants to take down somebody else. Everyone wants to find the thing. It's like I'm positive and energetic all the time, but some people think I have like some weird seedy underbelly, like I have like a weird peto ring or something that I'm keeping secret that they're like somebody waiting to find it out. Well that would explain why you're so energetic and happy. That's why I played happy wheels all those years.

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       Never. Everyone's just fucking waiting to find that thing about, I mean, you get shit on Youtube, right? I mean a lot. I think people love or hate you. Right? Would you agree with that? Yeah. Why do people like, what is it do you think that people hate about you? I don't know. It's cause it's, whenever you watch my content, I'm obviously very boisterous and very loud and very energetic, but some people either see that as genuine interests in energy and enthusiasm, but to another person it's completely obnoxious and that's like, I completely understand that there's, if I watched it, I'd probably have some sort of like thought process going on. It is very, yeah. I mean, I don't, I don't hate anybody who doesn't like what I do. It's fine. Does the hate bother you? Does it ever get too, it used to, um, because I, I'm a person who wants to like make sure everybody's okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:28       I, everyone's having a good time. Um, and I just wanted everybody to like, have fun. And then when somebody doesn't have fun, you feel like it's your responsibility to make them have fun button. At this point I'm like, okay, you can't win everybody. Yeah, I'll just be happy. I mean, there's still 20 million people on the channel. That's a fucking very, very happy with that. Yeah. You can't really say shit at certain point when you have 20 million subscribers. Yeah. I'm not in any sort of like egotistical way, but it's like clearly I've done something. Well people have some an understatement. Yeah. So I was like, I'll, I'll, I'll feed into that positive aspect of the community rather than worrying about what everybody else is going to say. Do you ever feel like you don't get enough credit in a way, and let me, let me explain because a lot of times like people like you and mark computed by who play, people always say, oh you just play video games and you're so, and you have so many, so much, you make so much money and you have so many people who love you and watch you.

Speaker 2:          00:16:20       All you do is play video games. But clearly there's more going on that you feel like you don't get enough credit when people say that too. Yeah, I'd say so. I'd say that's fair cause it's, what are they missing? It's, it's the whole aspect outside of what you record. Like recording it. Game shore day after day. That's an easy kind of thing to do. You sit down and turn on the camera, you record, but you have to find the games, you have to find stuff that people want to see when it's daily, everything like fluctuates so much and you have to like be always kind of there for your audience. And I'm very heavily involved in my audience and interacting with them. So it's like after the video goes up it's like, well now I'm on social media and I'm interacting with people that I'm making sure everyone's okay and um, re-blogging fine art.

Speaker 2:          00:17:02       I'm like tweeting out at people and everything. So it's, it's a whole lot more than just sitting down and recording the video and you see a 20 minute video. Like when I was recording what was the sub Nautica, it was like, like sometimes it was an hour long video, but that was like a two and a half hour session that's chopped down and that was going out every single day. So I was like sure. And it's, and it's isolated bubble. It's an easy thing to do to play a game. And react to it. But to do it that consistently for that long, they never take a break. I feel like just insane man hour. Yeah. So it's just like, it's not hard to do. It's hard to keep it up. Yeah. And I mean you, you find your rhythm, you get into your schedule. I mean the thing is like, yeah, once you start seeing your channel growing and you start making money, it's like really motivating.

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       But you get used to that. Yeah. And, and then it's like it's, I dunno, it's hard. It's like you lose, it's a thing, especially with my channel, cause it rose so quickly, obviously plateaus out. Every channel does. It's healthy. It's fine. Yeah. But some people went their channels plateau with a freak out and they feel like they have to do something else. Cause no insane growth is no growth at all to them. Sure. Especially when you're used to like, yeah, like this steroid injection. So it's like you started off in, everyone's like, oh this is fun, this is cool. And then it's like, oh well now I kind of get your gimmick. I know what you are like, what else can you do? And that's the trap people can fall into. Cause then that's how you ended up recording a dead body in a forest somewhere because you feel like you have to keep pushing this thing.

Speaker 2:          00:18:26       So you're, you're saying that you were basically just maintaining what made people like you to begin with what's the right, but your channel hasn't really slowed down. I mean it's not easy. No, it's not the center yourself and be like, what I'm doing is good enough and keep doing it and just be stable. Well that was always my mentality. It was like, sure. It's easy to be like, well, if this keeps going, I'll be a 10 million at this point. But I mean, no one knows what's going to happen. So it was always a case of like, okay, these people are here now, today. So entertain them, keep them happy, be happy with them and do what you want. If, if you keep doing it, obviously you're doing something right, more people are going to come in. I think that mentality of always like looking ahead of like, Ooh, I could get this amount. That's a very slippery slope to go down. Most definitely. Um, you, we didn't fucking real and we are covering so much ground everybody and let me hit them with one of these. Remember we'll still here.

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       You followed the Roseanne thing. Not that we need to get into it. I just thought it just through twitter. Have you heard this was and I love that she actually say that. Yeah. I mean we thought a lot about it so I don't want to get repetitive, unheard channel that happened when I was on tour. They recommend and we all woke up in the tour bus and looked at our twitter feeds and going, oh no. Well this was from her apology video. Oh, good apology Rosa. Yeah, I mean Christ listen clearly a very stable human being. That was my first thought. How do you like a touring you, you do a lot of touring, right? I mean you didn't seem to be on this on the road somewhat frequently. Yeah. We've got like two legs of the tour so far. It's the same show every time.

Speaker 2:          00:20:16       But we can segment it out. No, I love live shows. It's like, like create her an audience in the same room together, being able to do whatever the hell you want and then entertaining. I mean having that direct live feedback is so much fun. I think that was part of the burnout setting. Cause I did that and then I came back to my video is alone in my bedroom. It's like, Oh man, no one's here to listen right now. And it kind of gets in your head is small bits. So I had to reconfigure my, my brain. Right. I never said that word before in my life that I'm fully on board with that. What do you do in your show? It's like a, it's like a 90 minute standup show. So it's like a comedy show. Um, sort of about my life and then talks about my, my childhood, my teenage hood and my adulthood.

Speaker 2:          00:21:03       And so it's in three acts. And then you talked about your childhood and there's like good gaming memories from my childhood. So you get people up to play a game from your childhood and then that's insane. 90 minutes single man. Yeah, Shell, that's crazy. And Games are all about experience and overcoming your obstacles, which life is about. And then you move onto your next stage of life and you just keep going. And she told some funny stories from my life, I guess work. Can people get tickets if they want to catch you? Are there tickets available still? You sure can. You can go to Jacksepticeye, tour.com to get your tickets now. Get the word out there, Sam. Why not selfless promotion? Not the eight. Come on European tour dates. Went on sale today. Get your tickets to jazz show comedy world tour. Here's me life filled.

Speaker 2:          00:21:48       We've, we've done one live show and it was like an amazing experience. It was so, it was, it was magical. Honestly. In a way. It was so intense. How many people were there? It was like 200. It was like a small, I mean it wasn't a lot of people. I mean you probably, what size, what size you do. Uh, it's, it's between like 1500 to 2000, which is where we have to invent new sports, like 600, 800 depending on where it is. But yeah, so we just, we played a, a comedy, a store here in la. Yeah. Just to kind of test it out. And I mean it was, it was really amazing, but it was just so much work and it was like so stressful putting it together because it was also live streamed. We livestream is fit to go and set up all the cameras and do all this shit.

Speaker 2:          00:22:31       And I was like, man, but you guys did all that comfortable. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I, I work with the game grumps they have a 20 kilo, they produced it for you. So you very much just, you're able to show up and just do your thing. So I just wrote the material and practice it and ever, how long it take you to rehearse it and prep for, for these weak, you prepared it in a week. Yeah. But like how long to like memorize it and rehearse it and shit. I mean it, I never really like fully wrote it down. It is scripted, but it's kind of just in my head as I go through. How long and then how long before you did performed it? A month I think. And how was the first show? Great Fun. Touch the land. And you didn't, you didn't really rehearse it. I mean I did in my head over and over again, but not like properly out loud, like start to finish it.

Speaker 2:          00:23:23       How's the snow? Don't do that shit. Jesus Christ. Fucking balloon animals. Shit. No stop. How was your show evolve? Because it's, if it seems like if you'd just have it in your head, it seems like, is every show very different? I mean, how does that Pan out? The life stories are all the same and the punchlines and everything are all the same. But there's enough like Improv Room in between depending on the audience because the audience don't, don't know what it is and they don't know what to expect or anything like that. So when you start telling the stories, different jokes land with different people. So it's my farm. And they're your fans. They're, they're good. They're good. They're very good crowd. Yeah. And this is what I'm saying, like you guys did a live show. Clearly your fans showed up to it. Forgiving the barrier for entry is so much easier.

Speaker 2:          00:24:14       You're not going into a cold room. You don't have to prove yourself to, I know they're very easy. You should want to put it on a good show when something, you don't want to just get up and shit on stage and have people cheer for you. Well that's my next door. Well, right. The shitting on stage just jerk off. You're a cop on, I call it circle jerking, like get me a one vip. Um, but like when we do it, it's the podcast, right? So it's different every time. So the threat of bombing is, is very much right there for me. I'm bawling. I'm bombing right now. Do you, do you think it's, do you think it comes out of a fear of your audience? No, I just think I'm an anxious, well, I'm just an anxious person, but part of why I'm, I'm going to get fucking therapy on your ass right now.

Speaker 2:          00:25:01       Like we're, where does your anxiety start and what from, like what, what triggers it to like kicking bro. Waking Up. But the opening my eyes, there must be some like trigger factor to it. Like you're afraid of not performing well or letting someone down or well, not being funny. I mean, Eh, you know, uh, it was pretty stressful. I don't know. I haven't, you know, I need to, do you think your audience are here just to watch you be funny? They're there to be entertained, right? You know? Yeah. To a certain point. But yeah. I mean, huge numbers. People showing up consistently. They're here for your personalities more than anything. So what you're trying to tell me is that me just being me, she says, I'll hang up and being off and now you're telling me just being authentic is enough. Yeah. Wow. That's fucked up, dude.

Speaker 2:          00:25:52       Oh yeah. Sorry. Youtube 2018 be fake. No, I'm kidding. No, you're right. I've just honestly, I'm dude, I got, I got issues. We all have issues, man. I have real youtube for a living. I know I've always had really bad anxiety. I have, I had like generalized anxiety disorder in college that was like very, very, very difficult at that time and still carry a lot of that weight with me. I don't know. I honestly haven't really ever sorted out my issues. Dude. Do you go to therapy? No. Probably should I got issues back plug years? No, it's fucking wonderful man. You go to therapy? I have started. Yeah, I've started for how long have you been going? I've gone to, well I've gone to one so far, but oh, you're like, uh, I want to go like a whole bunch more in there than here. I have a bunch of friends who all swear by it and have like, so you've gone,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       when did you, when was your first session? About a week ago. Okay. And uh, did you guys have any breakthroughs or what? A little bit, yeah, really day one breakthrough. Yeah. Cause it's a lot about, well I say, I think maybe just the job we do, they're this, it's like talking a lot about balance and that was kind of a lot of stuff I came to terms with when I took a week off, I was like, yeah, that makes a mess. And I was doing that. I had never been anxious before in my life. And then in the last couple of months it was like sitting down and all of a sudden like, this swell and your chest happens. I'm like, I like, this is what the, what's going on? It's like, I don't like this. The best line ever heard an eighth and eighth grade. There's this great line. She goes, it's like, you know, before you get on the roller coaster and then when you're done and you get off and then it goes away.

Speaker 3:          00:27:28       But it's like you never get the relief of getting, being dumped. The roller coaster. That's how I feel all the time right now. You're anxious right now. Right now. I might that intimidating. It's not, well, don't flatter yourself. She beat you. She, she, she has abuse. Yeah, it should blink into the camera if you're unsafe. All right, let's take a quick break.

Speaker 3:          00:30:17       The incredible, the fact that it tells you when he said let's, let's forget about it for a second. Okay. Because we all know the quip is a incredible vibrating toothbrush that tells you how long you need to brush and when to switch sizes. We all know that it's incredible for that fact. But here's what people don't know about quip. That I think I need to tell the bristle. Okay. Is the softest. It's the best. It's so gentle on my gums but it's so strong on my teeth and I swear to God I'm not blowing smoke. I've tried every toothbrush under the sun because I'm obsessed with oral hygiene and my mouth doesn't come out feeling as clean or as well taken care of as this quip head cause it's got like soft bristles and it's got rubber on the outside and sometimes they'll go in there with the toothbrush and it will be too irritating on my gums.

Speaker 3:          00:31:09       And that you do not want to mess up your gums because let me tell you folks, those do not grow back tree your gums, right? And that's what quip for me is all about. Now we all know, as I said, that it vibrates. It starts at $25 and it's pretty much the god of toothbrushes. Okay? But what you don't know is how amazingly clean and fresh your mouth is going to feel after you use this fricking tooth. Rosen, I'm, I'm telling you this. I'm not, this is the only toothbrush I'll ever use because it's the best and it's just that simple. And the price is right guys. It's quip. If you haven't tried it, try it now because your mouth fucking stinks. It's disgusting. Your gums are receding, your teeth are rotting out of your head. Try this, give it a shot and see if it don't change everything for you.

Speaker 3:          00:33:53       That's me. I like saying your last name. You kind of looked at me when you said we're back. Like I was supposed to say something. I really liked the hearse. Something I really liked saying Mclaughlin. It's a fun. It's like, hmm. What's, what's Sarah McLaughlin? Is She Irish? Spelled the same name? I don't know how that is. Oh, and the arms of an angel? I don't know. I thought for some reason that was common knowledge. No. Okay. Let's move. Let's, it's an Irish name. Let's move quickly on this zone for a little bit long. How many other Mclaughlin's are there? So you're, you are close friends with markup markiplier right? Yeah. You got it. Make Long. Got there. How close are you guys? Clothes? Not as far as like the Internet thinks we are. I was just going to say how, I mean like do you guys say you guys have sleepovers? No. Okay. Do you think we talk every single day? Because what I was, I, I'm, because the Internet is quite to the contrary. I'm out, I'm gone.

Speaker 3:          00:34:53       There's this phenomenon on the Internet that is completely baffled me is that there's fan fiction. Have you and mark having like explicit Oh yeah. Growth task. Sexual encounter. Pure sodomy. I mean, yeah, absolutely. Pure sodomy and worse. Yeah. Not there's anything wrong necessarily with sodomy, although thought of me. So I mean when you say it's sodomy mean it's like a violent act. So it almost sounds like, is there anything like rapey about threatening, let's just put it that way. Right? And because you can make love to somebody asshole, but like saw but sodomy. But sodomy implies something like nefarious. Am I right or am I wrong? Dan, can you fact check the, the definition of sodomy is sexual intercourse involving anal or oral copulation. So you'd have a romantic sodomy. We went from like anxiety and youtube and depression to fucking sodomy. Basically what we've just established is that I could sodomized you romantically.

Speaker 3:          00:35:55       Yeah. It doesn't sound good though. Doesn't sodomy totally sodomized this girl. I saw them as though that over. It was, yeah. No, it doesn't sound, it's just a style, right? It's a lifestyle. It's a way of living. Well Padilla, I like the breadth of work is in sand. Like this is just trying to show the breadth here. There's like just hundreds of fanfiction here. It's just endless. What is going on here? Well you know what, hold on to that because again I think, okay good. It's gone well here. No, no, no, no. You're not just going to put up Niqab. Very vulgar picture are, you know, but I want to read just to excerpt so that the people at home can see what we're working with. You proud of me. Mine. I started made it. It's not you. You're not doing it. It's an interesting phenomena though.

Speaker 3:          00:36:43       And I want to get into it. Okay. You don't have your own fan fictions. Nobody wants to fuck me. No, nobody wants to fuck immediately. No, seriously. There's just like not at all. Which is why this is so shocking. I have like sex repellent. Nobody wants to fuck me for better or worse. He was the only one in the world that wants to fuck me and that's worked out. What do you think it is? What do you think people don't want to have sexuality? Cause I'm just like, I'm physically grotesque. I mean, first of all, that's pretty much, I mean like, you know, not that easy to look at first of all. Well like, you know, bodywise you'd nobody wants to fuck the Pillsbury's doughboy for example. I mean, some soft song, some people do, but not the people that Russ Pillsbury doughboy romantic sodomy, mantic sodomy.

Speaker 3:          00:37:37       So anyway, here, let me just read an extra Mckenna to put you through, but there's just this one. It's just so powerful. I started the Rus. I start thrusting, matching his balance shades of Jack. When I hear, Oh mark, I hit his prostate. Good and hard candy. Please hit that spot again. Check practically screamed. I hit his prostate again. Again, I jerked him off matching my thrust daddy. I'm close me to kitten. I mean, it's just a trip to the bay. Yeah, I mean I'm their kin. I hit his prostate one more time before he came in my hand. Jesus, not long after I released. This is the last one, so I'm not going to just let you know. Not long after I released inside of my pullout of him watching my seed. Like these people that are sick seed run down his thighs. I admire my work. Find Synonyms. Seed. Yeah, like that's just sick. Like damn seed. You don't, you don't get your baby seat out now. And then I get it out, but I don't necessarily call it seed because that's just seems a little fucked.

Speaker 3:          00:38:42       I watched, I pulled out and wash my seed, run down his thighs. I admired my work before he attempted to stand up, but fall right back down on the couch. Ouch. Yeah, it's going to hurt for a couple of days. Like it was a fucking Jackson pollock on his thigh. He planted some cz fucking blame the garden. Yeah. It's going to hurt for a couple of days. I say chuckling, getting up from the couch. I get a wet rag and help him clean up, but it's totally worth it. He says smiling. Hey Jack. Yeah, I love you. I love you too. So this shit isn't, there's romantic sodomy. Yeah, the definitely very definition of, um, full circle. So what's going on here? Is this like a mean? Yeah. Is this like, I mean by definition probably, but like what, am I joking though? Or No, no, no. A lot of this is not joking.

Speaker 3:          00:39:26       There's people who this is their sexual fantasy is youtube. Don't get who's creating these years? Creating this fens. But like who, if you imagine somebody who wrote that, what do they look like in your mind? It's fucking George or Martin. Yeah. Hunkering over his typewriter. That'd be great if he actually wrote us off. Fantastic. He's the genius. Find it. Will you be upset if I pull up some art? No. Youtube might be, no, I pulled it. I took out all the protest stuff a long time ago. This was, this started getting very weird, but we've been very vocal about, oh, some, it's pretty wet. Back to that one. That one, like, as much as I don't want to do that with mark. Um, that is fantastic artwork. Yeah, absolutely. Absolute dedication. Whoever drew that good art style. Oh, you're holding a cookie that you drop once you embrace him. Did you notice that are exchanging the cookie interesting detail that they would include a cookie and that this is old green hair. Oh, little nipple pinch. You know, I had to do it to him. Had to do it. Got Him.

Speaker 3:          00:40:37       Damn endedness crazy. But I'm sorry, I'm sorry to put you through this. I'm just like, there's something like really special here and that is just so incredible like that. This is a thing. I mean the way I've always tried to see it as that at first me and mark, obviously good friends, we got along very well. Once you start doing stuff together and you show that you have good chemistry together, like for let's plays and stuff, this type of stuff I think is inevitable. Um, damn. I remember that one. I'm getting the fuck. I really looks like a mark like that. They're good artists. I got to stay with me. Well your face is obstructed by beautiful kissing motion. Let me just cover it. Let me just say, Bro, I'm, I'm half Chubb Right now. Damn. Don't want me to make it a full job. Difficult Pinch. She wasn't no seed shit. Oh that's all of them. I know for the, for the longest

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       time people used to do that. Like we're like very heavily I me and mark said Okay Septa pliers a thing, we get it, please don't do anything explicit with it. Cause it's weird. It's not like characters from a book. It's not like Jonathan Harris. It was like people who actually know each other and get along and have a friendship and then they would do this and then it Kinda, it Kinda died down for a while and now it's very open that we're not okay with it. The whole step supplier thing we're like please don't very much like don't do this. Yeah. Cause before it was like do it in like a friendly bromance kind of thing. But then people still kind of took it further and further. There's nowhere like just just don't do it at all. You get weird interactions in real life. Cause I know you do your fence wood fence and I was like, did anyone like bring something that to you?

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       People will yell stuff at us. So like during some live shows, if I talk about, because there's a section in my life show where he's talking about something getting weird with like youtube popularity and someone yelled out, Septa player at me, I was like, no, stop kids here. Um, but yeah, every now and then somebody will say something about it and it's still a thing on the Internet and everything and people would still do it. And I don't want to take away from people's, if that's their outlet to create art and that's how they really want to express themselves. I don't, I hate being the person to take that away from somebody. But you personally via violated it seems like, but not violated. It's just, it's something that I don't think needs to exist, I think. I think it went too far and like jumped the shark too much and now it's like, well you can't see it without seeing that side of it anyway, I think.

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       Right. So I think that's why I'm Kinda like, yeah, just don't do it at all anymore. Whenever anybody does something, even if it's not explicit anymore, people will shit all over them and get bullied for and everything. And I don't want that to happen. Yeah. Damn you can just draw us as friends so I don't need to be kissing all the time. Yeah. Throw one of me and Ethan, I be fucking so honored you have fan fiction about sodomy fan art. I just need this episode if you guys can drop me. Jack fucking I'm down. I know about you but I doubt you have a, you have a free pass and this one, uh, one saul, don't worry, it's not going to become a thing. Nobody wants to see me naked bro. You should draw Easton like super buff, like just fucking ripped draw me as like a big gay bear because Donna's big gay hair, beard, beard with bdsm chain wearing flannel.

Speaker 2:          00:44:02       Nothing else man. But yeah it did get weird cause then anytime it got weird between me and mark, cause anytime we would hang out we'd be afraid of even like a friend can be natural. If there's a photo of you guys being like, hey then all of a sudden all of these little, yeah cause we did like a pax panel and we were playing cards against humanity with Ken and Felix and it was some moments where we like looked at each other and like had like phone interactions will actually think that you guys, do they think that it's real or do you associate that people think that you guys actually want it to be real but like, so they'll watch a video of you guys interacting and they'll see a moment of you guys like catching us in the back. I knew that they, and then there'll be like, uh, like they're just hiding there.

Speaker 2:          00:44:41       Bisexuality conspiracy. It's like I miss that part straight. Does that bother you? And you both had earned relationship, public relationships. I mean it's not, and then like it's just, it keeps going and going and going. Is that the part that bothers you that people think there's a conspiracy that you are mark are actually in a relationship secretly? No, I don't know. It's just, it's just weird. Yeah, there's a whole lot to it that's been going on for like four years. So there's not enough time for the talking back. And you do need therapy? Yeah, absolutely. With me. The a little couples there separately, they'd be like, dude, shut up together. You guys definitely need therapy. That's fucking weird. Just the fact that we did that alone. Yeah. Um Damn. It's fascinating stuff. It's weird. The Internet, it's crazy place cause I don't see fanfiction really about like on that degree about anyone else online.

Speaker 2:          00:45:39       I don't know why it is that got you to so field up. Maybe it's just, you know, there's maybe there's a subsection of a shared audience or something. I don't know. It's like tumbler thing. Right. I noticed you say you spend time on Tumbler. This is a tumbler phenomenon. This couldn't exist anywhere else. I don't know. We'll see. I'd like Tumbler Tumbler night. Do you go on Tumbler? I don't know what to do on Tumbler. What do kids do on time? What did you do want to come by told dude, you tumble Bruh. Is where all the best fan or it comes from? My okay. And everyone's like very engaged and it's a, it's an easy platform to like filter through I think where it's like everything else is typing in key word. How do you browse tumbler? What are you doing on Tumblr? Search through.

Speaker 2:          00:46:19       You have like a tag, same as anywhere else. You just search through it and you see people interacting with the stuff you've uploaded that I just think of like furries and like stuff like that. Well that's the thing, like that's, that's definitely a side of timber and anybody who's out in timber, we will say the exact same thing and it pops up. You almost can't avoid it. You're like, hey flowers for mother's day, here's a, there's a brony taken it up the ass. There's, there's porn bots on Tumbler. So you'd be going through that like your regular self to be some fine arts, some text posts, everything. And all of a sudden it's like a picture of a woman in a bikini saying she wants to have sex call her now. Really? It's just like, wow, okay. I don't know this woman or a metabolic, it's another ones like one lick.

Speaker 2:          00:46:59       My Pussy do it. I'm like, oh, right, sure. Did you get her consent? And what was really weird about it? Because you can tell it's just like instagram models or whatever and they're just obviously bought. So they find pictures that got interaction or have semi-nudity or whatever in it. And then one time I was going down and it was like a Jessica [inaudible] picture. I was like, wanna fuck her, do it. And I was like, wow, that was weird. Yeah. So in like, I know her actually the, actually this is a problem I've heard about is that like people who make porn ads on

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       the Internet, they'll just grab any photo. Yeah. Without any permission. Because like, Whoa, who are you going to do about it? So we'll grab a photo of a totally wholesome pretty girl from instagram and then put her on porn hub, like fuck hoc, local cuties or tinder. They're like catnip to people with somebody. That is so great. And that's gotta be an we know probably, but it's like impossible to do anything about it. Yeah. Crazy. Damn. I'm, I got my tumblr account and I have no access to it. You're not tumbling. I used to upload my art and I just forgot my password one day and I, it was my old email account and now I just have no way to, I mean tumbler is owned by Yahoo so it's a fucking mess. Yeah. So they locked me out. You ever tried to get back in and it was going on, tried your best to get you in.

Speaker 3:          00:48:22       You want to get back in and tumble? Dude, wait, how could you, is it linked to your yahoo account through the night? All the email, which I don't have the password to. You were just fuck your life. Yeah. It's called over healer. Where are you going to catch your Brownie for that? Do you ever see anywhere part on Tumbler on your time there? I did see like a, like randomly crawling. I remember all of a sudden there was born and I didn't even know where it comes to is a problem. Yeah. That's an issue. Tumbler get one. It was so long ago. I don't know if it's still the same. Yeah. I was like, I think it's always going to be the same. There's no way of stopping it. What? You know, again, like the thing that I see on tumblers, this furry porn. Have you seen that?

Speaker 3:          00:49:06       Can I just say, I'm really glad that the episode you start talking about furry porn on minute that I have to be on. I mean, do you want to participate in this conversation? We could skip, oh, we're in it. We're in it. Let's fuck. Because like I, that's the thing that I just, I don't have the empathy as a human being to understand. I don't relate on an emotional base like you, what you have, I don't know if you guys have ever seen brony or furry porn, but it's drawings of humanoid animals with massive Cox. I have never seen it come fest. Just nasty. Just don't get it. Okay. I don't let them explain this. Itemize each other. Okay. Romantics, Lisa. But if their lives are not harming you, okay. You don't use tumbler but come holiday. That's the stuff you do see on Tumbler.

Speaker 3:          00:49:51       Yeah, yeah. Fuck it all that. Well, I've used it to the extent where I'm like, all right, all right. Moroni downplay roney sodomy telling you, you don't have to fucking try that shit on there. You don't have to try. All right, look, Jack is Mr inclusive. He's going to stand up for fucking everybody, so I'm not even going to try to go. I mean, you're allowed to have your opinion. I just, I mean, I don't see it, so I was going to like, I mean, you're welcome to live your life and I'm not, I'm not going tell you don't. But I also have one hand need to acknowledge that that's fucking bizarre. Like we can acknowledge like, dude, keep doing your thing. Love what you're doing, but also what the fuck? Right. Like we can build, have both minds about it. Right? I guess you January, whatever isn't part of the southern part of the roadmap.

Speaker 3:          00:50:48       This isn't on your Flowchart, you know? But I mean, if that's what you're into, maybe that's what people think is, does that mean you want to fuck animals? No, that's the, that's the thing about it. It's like there's so much like intricacy to it. It's like, no, I just want to fuck somebody else who's dressed as an animal, so don't want to fuck. And because in the cartoons they are, they're not dressed as animals are animals. Right. And they have giant horse. Cox did it. You know what I'm saying? Well, I mean, if you're going to draw yourself, you might as well draw yourself with the giant horse cock, but they're are also horses. Yeah. Okay. I mean, I agree to me. I don't get it. Okay, thank you. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I don't know why I don't. I'm not, I don't mind them. I'm like holding you to this book. Plug tail. Yeah. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:51:40       That's a fascinating thing. I mean, if you've never seen it, go check it out on tumblr because it's fucking wild ride. It's a wild ride. It's a count on Tumbler Brownie Aisley Brownie experience on Tuesday. We're doing an episode and I'm this week I'm going to show you brony porn on Tumbler and we'll report back on Tuesday. Okay, great. Please text me if you want to look and call in if you want to call in. I love to true. I'll come back for a second episode of the podcast to talk about our only follows, we make it like a book club. Interesting stuff. Really. So, um, I love this or it's just so interesting that, I mean, your, your channel got its first big break from a puny pipe contest. Right? That's an accurate statement. Yeah. I have this clip. It's really short. It's crazy that this is just the small little shout out.

Speaker 3:          00:52:32       Okay. Um, oh, you're actually going to show this shout out. Oh my God, man. I don't think it's embarrassing or anything. It's really short fucking, I don't even know that he doesn't even, he doesn't even show you. He just said it. Yeah. Oh, look at you in the corner. That's me. Almost unrecognizable. Yeah. Dance. Sweet baby boy. How old were you at this time? Uh, 2013. So five years ago. Three mm hmm. Cool. Okay. How about the mothering fucking dad? I didn't even know. This guy. Seems crazy. I really like that. Whatever it is he's doing. He seemed really funny. His name is Jack Septic Eye. You should check him out. Check except the guy. What? What, what was that like for you? Well here's the thing cause there's huge misconceptions about that because it's easy. Look back at me and Felix

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       are friends and everything. I look back and say like, oh that's how he became popular. That's the secret. You just get a shadow competition. But at that time I was at 2.2 k subs there and then after that I came home from college and it was at 15,000 subscribers, which is fucking bananas at that moment. And then after like three days and went up to 20 k and then completely stopped, nothing happened after that. And Christine and I had been doing like grand theft auto five videos twice a day for like a week and no one was watching those either. So the people who came from the shout out and kind of watch one video and it got like 15 k views and then just didn't watch anything else. Everyone. And then people just stop subscribing. It went from like getting 3000 subs a day to a hundred right.

Speaker 2:          00:54:10       And then it's like no one really watched any more. So that that was, that was the moment where I changed like everything I was doing and Tristan and became more of myself and just like settled into the content. So how long after the shadow was it, like what's the timeline of, of the growth of your channel? Like in comparison is how long did it, how much time passed from that shadow to the point where your channel started? Like picking up traction? About six months, I'd say. So it was after that, that was September of 2013 and then after that, like the rest of the year passed and nothing was really happening. Some stuff was still like residual and everything, but I just like put my foot down. I started doing videos like much harder, much better, a lot more variety. I wasn't just doing the same game anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:54:54       The whole top of the morning thing became like a huge thing at that point. And then it was August, 2014 that the channel hit a million soaps. So it was like right after that, nothing really happened, but it was the thing that instigated the passion in me. So it was like, well, here's this opportunity. I thought it would make the channel huge and then it kind of died out real quick. And I was like, okay, well I need to do something I need to like that's, you know, that is what, that's the beautiful thing is anyone can get a shadow. Like it happens all the time, but not everybody takes that. Yeah. And shout to, into an opportunity to shout out alone doesn't get you to no. Yeah. And Felix at 26 million subscribers at that point, fucking just dental is even back then. He was like, yeah, so like five years later, and I'm like six behind that.

Speaker 2:          00:55:43       And it's like if you told that kid that that was going to happen, he would've lost his fucking mind. Um, no, but I think that that's the testimony. It's easy to be like, oh, he got a shell from Pupae, you know? Of course he's got 20 million, but like the shadow is literally, it's just like a little like it's like this. Yeah, the little, it's important but like you have to take, and the analogy I always use is like your channels, your care. Felix is the key. Turning it on, get you going, teaches you how to like drive it or whatever, but you're the one who has to like change gears and stay in lane and drive down to the fly. The way that shadow wasn't that ethic either. No, it was like very lightweight. If you go through, there's a, there's a couple of other channels who he shouted out in that and there was another channel called illmatic.

Speaker 2:          00:56:27       I remember who I thought was phenomenal because of his editing at the time was insane. I think he's Australian and he got up to like 11 key subs and then never went any further. I don't know what his channel was that now I hope he's doing well. He'll manic shut up but are getting a shout out bro. Shout out from shouting, getting a fucking, it's shout out all day. I know what it was. That kind of thing where I'm like, well I want this to work so I want to like put the effort in and get it going and see how far I can push it. Um, and to get a shout out you kind of have to be putting the work in already. Like he wouldn't have shouted me out if I wasn't doing two videos a day at that point anyway. Was there a point where you're getting feedback and you're like, oh shit, they like what I'm doing cause I remember I had a moment like that where you're like, oh fuck something.

Speaker 2:          00:57:09       I'm doing something right. Do you remember a specific moment? Yeah, I think it was fairly early on. People obviously like the accent a lot, but they like the energy and the enthusiasm because you kick it up at one point were, I mean cause like you said that you took the six months and you really focus on your content. It was just something you changed where people were like, oh that, that's good. Do more of that. It was just a case of being more of myself because at that point I was trying to imitate like the metrics and the Felix to everybody else who was kind of doing let's plays at that point and then after that was like, well I'm not going to get anywhere from somebody else that already has a channel. So I just started being more of who I am and talking honestly and saying, yeah, that sounds really healthy dude.

Speaker 2:          00:57:50       Fuck. I guess being yourself not to take away from it. I'm hugely grateful for the shoutout Felix stage and I'm really glad that it happened and I would never take that back. I just think that there's some misconceptions on the line of what that did and that's why everyone's like, you need to do a shout out competition now because Felix did one, I can see it being a little frustrating of being like you owe everything to this one shot. It's like, well that's really not what happened. Yeah. And even Felix for like recently came to me, he was like, do you want to like delete those videos off our channels anymore? Cause like it's like still a whole thing cause he knew that people were like shitting on me for that and say like you're only popular because of this thing. So that's so insane.

Speaker 2:          00:58:33       That's so ridiculous. Keep it there. It's a piece of history that, but no, it's good. Yeah. Live. You'd go and watch it. You can see it's like he's not like you need to go subscribe right now. Play your video. It was like check the guy out and he, he, I think he was supposed to do the shadow of competition and then he kind of forgot about it and then he did it really quick cause he came back from somewhere and then that's why he's face, this isn't even on it cause he just recorded the thing with his microphone. Unbelievable man. Cutie Pie. You want a guy has on another level. Yeah. And he's still five now. The way we talk about like burnout and shit, he still posting every fucking okay. I don't know how he does it. He must be deeply, deeply, deeply damaged and miserable, but he seems really well adjusted. That's what is the optimum? We're all damaged man. I mean he changes up as content enough to keep it fresh for himself. So yeah, I don't like how well adjusted he seen it. I don't like it at all. A psychopath and he doesn't care about anything. That's what I like.

Speaker 2:          00:59:37       Podcasts. Felix is a cycle. What's with the top? What's the top of the morning? What's going on there? Where'd that come from? Oh, well if you go back and watch an earlier video, my intro used to be hello all you beautiful people out there helping them. I was like, I wanted to, yeah, I wanted to have like somebody else's voice. Mine. I hated my accident. I didn't like look at, they sell for anything. So my earlier videos have a different intro, different voice, no face cam. And then later on, like during that time I was like, well I don't really like this. And they started showing my face and then everyone thought I was American pretending to be Irish because me doing that for probably sounded kind of Americanized. And then I was like, well I want to show people I'm Irish. What's the most Irish thing you can say?

Speaker 2:          01:00:21       And then an episode of friends, Monica Says Tapa Dot Martin and tea that's very Irish that it was like, okay, I'll be as Irish as I can be in the first five seconds of my video, just as a joke. That's fucking, and then people resonated with it. I was like, if you don't make the first five seconds of the video, you're not going to like the rest of the fuck off. So the great firewall, that's interesting. Sorry. So I can't really take credit for friends. Lots of generations of Irish people came up with that. How do are you famous in Ireland? Because like do you get recognized more? You're the biggest youtuber in Ireland. Do you get recognized? Do people know about you in Ireland? Yeah, they do. You say it like that. Why do you say it like that? Cause when I was living in, I was living in a small town that had like 15,000 people in it.

Speaker 2:          01:01:06       Yeah. Like every time I went outside it was like get ready as I was like six seven. Really? Yeah. Wow. Cause just cause it's a small town and people know what you live there and people are just out and about anyway, depending on at the time of day, obviously I want to have green hair. It was just a lot more you bond over payment in Ireland. You're Bano famous pretty like household name honorary president of Ireland. Pretty much. I think it probably president level. Well what's, it's funny cause a thing that happened awhile ago was they did a list of the top 10 most influential Irish people in like a tabloid paper. It meant nothing. But at number 10 was the president and nine was Bano and then I was next to you're done, you're old news. So it was really fucking weird. And I was like, yeah, that's not, that's, that is not a horn was right after me.

Speaker 2:          01:01:57       I was like, Hey, no. How do a Irish people feel about, about you? Are they like, are they like, hey, one of our boys? You know what I mean? I mean, what's the mentality like, hey, it's very divided. Religious people can be the most passive aggressive people you'll ever meet. They're super friendly and they're great, but they'd be like, anytime somebody would see like the thing about Irish people, it was like you'd see somebody like at a person in la would see somebody like big house in the hill and they'd be like, wow, that's what I'm going to work towards. We're an Irish person. You'd be like, Oh fuck. And doing well for himself, isn't he great hill? And then you never talked to him or anything. That's a really funny and so some Irish people are like, yeah, he's out there representing the country. And then those people are like, I hate that he represents our country. And I'm like, I'm not representative fucking anything. Just don't like that. I can't even represent myself.

Speaker 2:          01:02:46       What, what, what? That's so if you go like how much are you going to recognize here in La is compared to like back in Ireland? Not nearly the same really because I think green hair. Yeah, I expected the opposite to be frank. Really? Well I don't know because like Isla and probably the biggest challenge Israel, right? Most famous Youtuber, I don't know. But in Israel and no one knows. No one really knows about bald. Well also I think it's the language barrier probably. Is You speaking Hebrew, English obviously that's where we speak to. Oh I thought we were speaking Hebrew all this time.

Speaker 2:          01:03:25       Do you remember, was there a time where like, cause your channel at least from my recollection seemed to like blow up really fast, right? Yeah. Was there like a month or like a period of time where you went from making like you know a couple hundred bucks to like all of a sudden your income was like insane. Yeah. It went from earning just enough to like get by each week to a point where was able to like go right an apartment, move out of my parent's place and just like what's the scope of time and like a month. It wasn't like fucking crazy, but I mean at the time, yeah it was, it was nuts. It was like the difference between like a hundred dollars a month to like six and a half thousand and I was like, I can move out. Yay. That is sick. I can actually rent a place.

Speaker 2:          01:04:12       What were you doing before youtube? You had a job where you going to college? Where did you see yourself going before that you had this whole opportunity? I went, I've gone to college twice really? So I went to college for music production first and then like that, it wasn't very good at it. I played drums and I wanted to learn more about that, but it was all about theory and how to fix electrical circuits and shit like that and I didn't care. So I left that and then it became very depressed and miserable at home. That's when I started youtube and then went back to college for Hotel Management and graduated from Hotel College. You did? How many years is that? Who it tell the call it three years. You're a fucking hotel manager, Bro. Tray. What did you learn that in? Hotel management? Fuck all. You learn how horrible hotels are. The whole time we were there they were like, hotels are overworked, underpaid, understaffed, and they're all losing money. And we were like, cool, I'll get my gym. Good effect that so weirdly specific and then now you can learn that. So in in college when I was doing like the final semester, that's when that moment happened and I was like,

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       I left college wants before I should finish this one out and get a degree of some sort. I don't know if youtube is going and that thankfully it took off cause I don't to work in a book in a hotel. And you were living with your parents? Yeah. How did your parents feel about the youtube pursue? I mean my parents have always kind of been supportive almost to a fault. They're one of the good ones. Yeah. Well I to a fault, I don't think you should give them that much credit, but it was just the case of like whatever I was into they would just let me do and if I was passionate about it they would. Do you think if you are like now still at 5,000 subs at home being a Youtuber, what would they, could they still be like do your thing or would they be like you need to fuck off, push out? I'd say they'd be fine. DABS. One other good one.

Speaker 3:          01:06:03       That's pretty interesting. Damn. They've been nice people. Sorry. You're going to open your own hotel now all the way to the top of the morning. Cause like you've um, what's the first, what's the first nice thing you bought when you started getting that cheddar cheese and Guacamole? I bought an ipad mini. That was the first nice watch game. Grumps video is in bed. I used to watch them every day but it was on my computer. I'm like, ah, I wanted to watch it. I didn't have a smart phone at that point. I was like, I want to watch them in bed. So I bought an ipad mini, it was like 600 euro. I was like, ah, this is way too fucking much that something like this. I was like, well, I'll even get the use out. And I went over like a month in my head being like, should I get it man?

Speaker 3:          01:06:48       I don't know. Then I got a needs that every night. Thank God I still have. Nice. Yeah, you use it. I don't use it. Yeah. Yeah. That's cute. It's a nice little remembering. First thing we bought, I remember the first thing we bought nice was the TV and we were in New York and New York. I bought like a 35 inch TV to him and I was like, I never, I never owned them. We never had a duty for five years. And I was like, I was like, listen, I had a pretty good month. I'm going to buy myself a TV. Hell yeah. Drop that chat around it and it wasn't built. You're actually, it wasn't the one in the podcast studio until we replaced it. We replaced, yeah. You got rid of your own piece of memorabilia. Yeah. Well, you gave it to family or they give it to who's, who's someone took it.

Speaker 3:          01:07:31       Ian's got it. I'm not upset. I'm not sentimental until now. You and I want my fucking tv back into our bedroom was tiny and the TV was big. We were in this tiny New York apartment and I wanted a big TV dude. I was crushing. It was like 500 bucks by like fine. Like it was only the bed and the TV. I mean it's a smaller than. Yeah, I mean it makes the TV look bigger, right? Yeah. Oh, the TV was in normal. I look at it now. List small. I mean, what's Nice as much. This is like 65 smaller. It was much smaller, but like I, we watched, we watched a lot of hits on directs hunter. Oh yeah, dude. First Time washing that banger. Love that show. I thought everybody was an anime. I say, listen, you've got to watch hunter x hundred people. Don't listen to me.

Speaker 3:          01:08:17       People need to listen to me more. This is your moment. Shouted out. We tried to tell everybody for you there. Advocate. I'm a super fan. Oh really? Are you, do you, I mean, what's your favorite anime? I don't know cause I had gotten into animate like very recently. I mean I watched like dragon ball when I was younger. And have you watched hunter x hunter? No, I know of it. And then as a legacy to it. But you said it like you've watched it. No, I know it's, I know it's probably decent. It's decent. Give me a fucking break and I didn't mean to fucking attack. Okay, go right. You're told me the brony bloaty like what do you watch? My favorite is one punch man. Oh, okay. One Punch is probably my favorite show of all. It's his favorite. Like I've watched it three times and still rewind boy, like every week.

Speaker 3:          01:09:04       Every week he asked me, do you want to watch one punch man? And I'm like, Oh that was gone. And yes I have. I don't, you'd have to leave this table, but I don't want to read, watch the whole season 10 times. I love it so much that I bought it on Amazon again so that I could watch it with the English dub. So that felt newer, cause I've watched it so many times it wasn't shit. No, I loved it in English. Yeah, it's pretty good. I ended an English and I took some getting used to, but yeah, he's in two. Got It announced. Yeah, I just like it. It's well animated. The pacing of amazing. Great. It's, it's got like the perfect show. It's, it's doesn't take itself seriously Ila. It's hilarious.

Speaker 3:          01:09:49       Have you? Yeah. It's a show. You're in the minority here. I've watched it like three times to just go. Yeah. Thanks Dan. I'm not even that much of a super fan. Yeah. He, he's in the minority of friends and this is so perfect. It's like, it's hilarious that the fighting scenes are the best I've ever seen. Yup. So, well animated doesn't take itself seriously. Compelling characters. Incredible action. Nonstop thrill rides while maintaining a great heightened sense of humor all at the same time that I mentioned. Great animation. Yeah. Yeah. Well I can't wait until they come out into like a one punch man. It's not the best that's actually attack on Titan. Okay. False. I liked that show. I love attacking. It's not better than them. I hate to admit this, but I feel like all my favorite shows right now or anime it's cause there's good animals.

Speaker 3:          01:10:42       No, it's like the one on Netflix now. If the little cat girl who gets Anglo, I haven't watched that. I've seen. Is that a good one? Yeah, I'll check it out. It's fun. I mean, I saw the picture, I was like, I can't, I'm not really my take my hero academia. We're watching a dude. I'm all caught up in that shit. You want to get some superhero right now? Micro academia. If I'm fucking, every Saturday it's on Hulu. I'm like [inaudible] clearer calendar. And of course also baby. I have to say the fight scene, but to I don't want, I'm not going to spoil anything but like that epic fight scene between one of the newer ones. Yeah. But it's with all my, the villain. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God, Dude. I was like, I've so captivated. Yeah. I watched that episode back to back twice. That's a good one.

Speaker 3:          01:11:32       Damn. Any broken? No hero fans out there know. Um, um, but I love all these shows. But hunter hunter by far, I mean in terms of like writing and music, I mean the writing and that show is, is beyond anything I've ever seen. It, it's like 550 ups. That's a, that's a bit steep. I mean, all good. There's enemies like, like a one piece I'll never fucking dare to get into because it has like 5,000 episodes and it's still going like take a rest. I used to watch him to bleach and then it was like tried nothing is a choice. It's never getting to the end. Give me a break dude. I need to know that there's an end in sight. That's why I'm like full metal, full metal alcohol. Yeah, that balance. That's my second favorite. I him in on that. That was one of the first anime series we watched and I loved it.

Speaker 3:          01:12:27       But I tried rewatching it recently and after becoming a fan of like, you know, one punch man and, and, and uh, hunter x hunter and I'm like, don't love it as much. The original or Brotherhood though. Brotherhoods obviously, you know the more cherished one. The good one. Yeah. I don't know that it was a good judgment though, cause I think you only tried like to like just at the beginning. Yeah, it's pretty slow. Yeah, I guess so. I still think it's up there. You know it's one of the best ones ever. Yeah. Did the tea, the tea, what's the tax rate in Ireland? Let's get to what's really important. It's like 15% isn't it? It's like 12 and a half corporate texts. Oh my God. That's what you pay because you're probably incorporated, right? Yeah. Well I'm not in Ireland anymore. Oh, so you're getting fucked by UK now.

Speaker 3:          01:13:15       Was that a big change for you because that Ireland has like one of the lowest tax rates of any, what is it in the UK? It's probably right up there with it everywhere else. Like 40 or something 40 40 I don't, I don't want to say out loud because I can't remember it off the top of my head, but it's like much more. Was that a big change for you? Yeah. That's kind of painful. It's also just you have to control the fucking paperwork of moving everything over. That is so annoying. So you had to change your company to an English company or how does that work? Yeah, it was just a lot of shit involved with like creating like subsidiaries and shit like that. Just to make sure everything was above board.

Speaker 3:          01:13:55       I have fantasies about paying 15% tax rate. I wake up like, oh my God, I texted only 15% I'm like, no. It was just a dream. Oh here. It's like closer to 15 in California. Just a, if you want to move to La, you can be paying 50% okay. I'll keep that in mind, man. Start saving up now. They have enough of that tax bill. Can't wait to pay that army bill. I mean 50% that's what you're facing here. I mean that's, that's what's ridiculous about it, right? It's because we, you don't really get much. Yeah, yeah. No college and health care, that's a whole rabbit hole. That's the thing, because my editor is from Sweden and everything over there is free. So like free healthcare, free education, you get paid to go to college. I don't get all these, other than that, it's like a conservative talking point here.

Speaker 3:          01:14:44       Is there like a socialism never works and it's like, what are you talking about? Scandinavia is like a utopia. I mean it works out. The social, the social programs, it's not a shit hole country. No, apparently no far. I mean, no, I wouldn't say so. But um, rmn well you probably don't want to get into politics political they made, cause I'm not thinking about politics and I'm just a person experiencing like paying so much taxes, but you don't get anything. I don't know even why it's gotta be so political. Well, it's like, I mean, I guess it's something that I've been thinking like trump wanted to have $100 million military parade in DC and meanwhile actual veterans aren't getting healthcare. It's like what the fuck? Meanwhile it's like you always get this talking point of like, how are you going to pay for it? You say you, it's a very liberal talking point that you want, you know, healthcare and college tuition free to whoever wants it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:52       And they always say, how are you going to pay for it? It's like, Bro, you, how are you going to pay for your $100 million military prey space force? Damn. Let it out, man. You know, speak your truth. How are you going to pay for anything spilled? I political worry. We're in debt. Trillions of dollars. What do you what? Who's paying for that? I don't know how I could figure it out now. They figured. Well, the truth of the matter is that when you have social healthcare, it's actually cheaper than what the fuck ever. Where have we have now? Because like, well anyway, you're gonna have to drop a soundboard on now to break that 10. It's true.

Speaker 3:          01:16:30       Maybe not the right one to drop. So you get here. We will speak. Got It. Let's do you have a lot. Are these new, you just got your stream decks. Alex Jones. I'm here. This is my favorite. You're going like this? Yeah. Oh, you can just intersperse them the curb theme every time I die in fortnight. That shit. Really? Yeah. You let carb. Yeah. I haven't watched a whole lot of people. What I've seen is good. Yeah, that's great. Do you watch Seinfeld? No. Is it popular in Ireland? It's popular everywhere. It was like it came right

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       before my time and then growing up friends was like the big thing. Yeah, so I kind of missed the Seinfeld boat, but I do want to go back and watch it. It's, I recommend it forced a few episodes on curved Daniel. Definitely in like Seinfeld. You. How many tattoos do you have? Do you have just one? Just the one. I want to get a second one. This here. I'll show the people here. You like massive blood. One Tattoo, right? We have it right. You actually can show it. Yeah. You don't need a picture here it is on the TV. If you guys with directly or have you guys look on the TV here. There it is. Wow. It's so the likeness. Uncanny. What? What does the game mean to you that you are so enthused about this game that you were, you wanted to tattoo it?

Speaker 2:          01:17:54       What is it again to people like me with don't know bloodborne. Dan's a big fan of it apparently. Yeah, so what I've always kind of been from software and the people who make it and I love dark souls. I love dark souls. Two, three demon's souls and this, and then I always wanted to get a tattoo anyway and it was in my head was like, what the fuck am I going to get? Nothing. Reading means a whole lot to me. And then this, this I decided to get because you have, you don't need to know a bloodborne is to know what this is and I think it's just a cool design anyway. I was like, well I want to make the leap and get something and then it's like my second favorite game of all time and then it's first shadow of the colossus. Well let's get a fat fucking tatted on your face on my face.

Speaker 2:          01:18:36       While I don't know you love it that much more. I've never played that game, but it looks amazing. I've seen footage. It's so cool. Nice. I played when I was a teenager and it blew me away. When you poop, do you uh, do you wipe forward or backwards? Front to back. Front to back. So you boast about you go like this? Yeah. Okay. What do you do? Listen, it's a whole thing, but no, I go fucking, I go back to front. I go under the balls and I, and so it's really a point of contention contention here on this podcast, but it fucking weird shit into your balls, bro. Aye. What if you drag shit up your ass crack? Then you can just keep wiping, but do you yeah. Well that's weird. I have control dog. I'm weird. You Street shit up your ass crack all the way up called control dude.

Speaker 2:          01:19:31       All the way up the back. Leave a good sense. Or do you uh, use baby wipes? No. You go all dry. Yeah, I mean if there's a, if it's a messy situation, there's a sink nearby, you know, was just like Dab it up with your hand. No, the toilet, the toilet paper because it's wrong with it cause I, well because I can't wet toilet paper cause it my assholes Harry and it sticks to the hair and gets dingleberry's. But you have a cloud. Asphalt sounds like a fucking you problem man. No Man shall pass. Do you shave your ass? I mean a little bit. Yeah, I'm going to keep things but

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       how do you schafly shave your asshole would very precise tools. What? Tell me cause I'm, I'm man that needs to learn. I don't know man. I don't want to like, like dollar shave club. Could you use a racer? No, not that fucking weird. That's what I'm concerned about because I don't how old baby you, you, you, you, you, you manicure with scissors or what? I mean, whatever. Whatever gets the job done. Whatever's in the house. Hedge clippers, lawnmower. Huh? You know, so you don't use a razor and get it in there. No, Jesus. That's what I, that's what I imagined. But the thing is, even if the assholes are short, I feel like, well I feel like it's still good stuff. I, well I don't, the situation is clearly different. What was it? I could just be lying right now as well and dragging you down a rabbit hole.

Speaker 3:          01:20:58       You're not lying. I'm not lying. No, I'm here. Yes. Shaven. Just the thought. Never crossed my mind. To be frank with you. I know. I actually had guests here who they shaved their asshole too to help this situation down there and I'd have to think that would be a huge life improvement for me, but I don't really know how to get in there. Do you put a mirror on the ground? Do you lay on your back and look at your asshole in the mirror? I mean, how do you do it? How'd you get the, how do you get the vantage point? I think you just guess. You guess it's like, what? Like this? Do you have a fucking prolapse ass? Oh, but like hemorrhoid sticking out. I don't know. It just seems like a more delicate job than just, you know, blindly go and lady get it watches. Wow, that's fucked. Just take a page out of Philly ds book and just jump into it. Just get right into it. I don't think that's what he was talking. It probably is.

Speaker 3:          01:21:54       He seems like a clean, I'm fascinated by this because everyone's said this is something that you know, generally isn't talked about, but everyone has really, no, we need male role models right now. Half of my audience are freaking out right now. I didn't need to know. Yes you did. Fanfic just got a whole lot weirder. Atomizing it after shave each other's asses. I didn't say that. Oh God. It just give people ideas. Um, one thing that I did pick up from having this conversation I'd like to pass on to you and actually some of our listeners who are probably waiting for updates, metamucil, have you heard of that? It's a fiber supplement made up this thing called Piss psyllium husks and it really tightens your, your shifts. Yeah. And so I found that it's really, it's been a great, really great, beautiful thing. Take a pop with a couple of those in your mouth.

Speaker 3:          01:22:44       This fiber, it's supposed to be anyway. Farber fiber. It was just balanced. You wouldn't be, I'm slurry call it. How has it helped? I mean sure, but it helped. It helped euros all the time. And Uros you're not from la? No ghost. I'll call it Tulsa. We shouldn't like a dream burger and burrito salsa note. It's also, it doesn't help you do what Irish people fuck with spicy food? No, actually I do. What do you mean Ireland? Like what's the dish that like people fuck with their yeah, we don't, we don't really have like traditional dishes out. Oh, we to cover that down. I'm going to lawsuits in here. Yeah. Are we covered by insurance? I think. I don't think we are. I'm bleeding everywhere right now. Um, no. Like lamb stew is like a big thing or shepherding my lamb stew. That sounds Dank. It's pretty good. Really fatty cut of lamb. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:23:42       What? Shepherd's Pie. I'm not sure I've ever had authentic minced meat with certain light. We've had that over like mashed potatoes, mashed potatoes on top, on top. Cook it. So it's like crispy on top pie crust on the top. No, that's American. That's something that they would do in America. Like guilty for us. I'm going to add, pick it up and off. Then it's a melted cheese on top whipped cream right now. I'm hungry. That's what you get the shitty ass all the time. Exactly. But I need help. I need help. I'm not kidding. And let me tell you what, I'm not paying for anybody. Aren't you supposed to be his carer? Fuck this shit in Ireland. Like a and made of intestines and show like blood put and you fuck with blood pudding. Hell yeah. Black, black pudding. I have blood that you eat basically spices in it.

Speaker 3:          01:24:38       She's good tank. It's healthy or unhealthy. Oh, woefully unhealthy. I'd say full of salt, but it's so good that it's worth it. Yeah. Put It on a, it's like a four Irish and say, think of a better, like more enticing name. What was called black pudding. Oh, it's not blood pudding. No, that's, that is what it is. But we don't call it though cause no one would eat that. Yeah, that sounds so weird. I mean, you eat sausages, which is lined with like, no, I'm done. Yeah, I liked it. Um, do you have? Well, we've got pretty much everything sorted. Okay. We got through the, the sodomy, the firies, the politics. He dropped a fortnight in there, right? Yeah. I'll put four, nine. The thumbnail. We talked about Logan, Paul and therapy. Logan. Paul. We talked about the suicide forest. Yeah. Who's going to win that fight?

Speaker 3:          01:25:32       Drop that in there. August 25th we didn't talk about that now and then I'll click bait. I have talked about, oh we did this podcast today. Not Today. Who Do you think's going to win? I think Logan's going. When is he taller? Does they have a longer reach? What makes you think that? Yeah. Yeah, he's taller. He just seems like he, he's bigger. He's probably way more ways, more like no case. He's like stacked and everything and he'd got into great shape. But watching him fight Joe Waller who was like, well you only one cause joe didn't really fight. I haven't,

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       I haven't seen that actual flight. So that would be good to inform my opinion. But a lot of times in boxing and fighting in general, the bigger guy generally wins. That's why you have weight classes, but these guys are probably not in the same way. I don't have to Tyson Tyson, but they were in the same way class. He was heavy. It was, yeah, that's true. Right? Yeah. But Tyson was also like a fucking monster. I just think just physicality will win out. And Logan used to do like wrestling in college and high school and stuff and so I've always leaning towards case I simply, because he had already had a fight maybe. But from what it sounds like not that valuable of experience, but what I do think is that it's going to be fairly boring cause they're not professional fighters is going to go the whole length. Nobody's going to get knocked out and somebody's going to win on on a technical one. Yeah, it's going to be, it's going to be best. Oh we were wrong. Hopefully someone gets like, mommy and I'll wash the, I'm gonna Watch the highlights. I'm washed the fuck out of the highlight. Or you're not going to get to $10 pay per view. Is it only 10 bucks? I thought it was like 11 days, $10 paper. Paper view doesn't pay the bills. Come on. Why is that so a lot. 100,000 people watching. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:27:15       They're going to charge more than that. I honestly have no idea. I didn't know what's going on with that. Um, yeah, well fuck that. We should just put money into a pot and see who wins that pays the bills if you're good at it. Yeah, so we've pretty, yeah, I mean we've, we've really covered every single thing. I was wondering that people are very religious in Ireland, right? Yeah. Are you religious? No, I haven't been religious since I was like 12 I used to be an altar boy though. Really? What happened? Did you just like, I mean, was there something or you're just like, Eh, not for me. Yeah. God got, it was so weird. It was such a fucking woke 12 year old. Really. I was like running down the field, playing around and then I just thought to myself, I cut very existential was like, what if it's not real?

Speaker 2:          01:27:58       What if God is not up there? What if God is not one of us. And then I like went down this rabbit hole and I was like, I don't think I believe in God anymore. On by on your own, kind of do your own thing. Are you, is your family religious? Yeah. Oh, am I gonna do they think about your, are you an atheist? Would you consider yourself an atheist or an agnostic or you just not, yeah. What would you say? I'd say more agnostic. More for the optimism of it. Sure. We're atheism is like, no, nothing exists. Yeah. Like gnostic is like something might exist. Who knows? Opened up my eyes to it. Yeah. God isn't real. Changed my mind. Yeah, exactly. Um, how does your family feel about the, your godlessness put my hedonism. My parents never really cared. They didn't mind. They went to church and everything, but I never told my grandmother that. I didn't believe in God because she was very, very religious and, and I'd never knock on anybody who is like, if you want to do many of their, it gave her like great peace of mind and she felt a lot closer to things in her later years, everything so fantastic.

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       But for me it just, it didn't really make sense in my head. Just say. Hmm. Is there a growing like a among younger people, that's probably a growing attitude though, right? 100%. Yeah. I mean we're just legalized abortion there at a couple of months ago. Right. And that's cracked just a couple of months ago. Ironically, America is going to, going back to making it illegal. I mean that's huge for Ireland and like same sex marriage is allowed there now. And that was a recent development too, right? That, yeah, that was what that was within the time I've been doing youtube, I remember that. Maybe like two years ago. Hmm. Great. I don't know. The moving forward. The whole world is so weird thing that, well, it's not that word. It makes sense, but it's just interesting. Hmm. Okay, but can we talk about religion?

Speaker 3:          01:29:47       Talked about, well, sex life shit. How's yours? Yeah, let's not get into it. What does that mean? Now I want, now let's get into it. What's your relationship like with your parents? Fine. Oh, not bad, huh? It's fine. It's great. My parents, whenever they come back, they're fine. It's not like that. How's your sex life? I'm talking about my fucking, since you brought it up as a fucking meme, you have a girlfriend, right? Long Story. I get it. Huh? Do you have a girlfriend? Right. Stop swords. She's a white woman as a wife. Girlfriend now as well. Yeah. No, I don't have a girlfriend. I don't have any time. What? I don't have any, I mean together, although I immediately fell sourcery for me to have a side girl. Yeah. I have to work quite impossible. I'll also add to the mix that nobody wants to fuck that maybe would make it even more of a feed there.

Speaker 3:          01:31:03       There's some people out there. I'm sure some people in the comments right now being like, I would definitely fuck you. Yeah, they're not out there. I'm telling you like married like very public publicly and you, so you think people would want to fuck me. Shit. Maybe fanfic. It's an idea. I write one for you. That'd be sick. What about me? But I'll just in general I'd write one. Actually I did it. I forgot I, I noticed you sit in a video that 2017 was the worst of your life. That really stuck out to me. I was like, Whoa, I don't know if you want to talk about that, but I was really curious like what was going on in 2017 there's a lot of stuff, a lot of like youtube stuff and everything and trying to figure out what I wanted to do. Like that thing of like climbing the hail and then getting there and be like, what else can I do it now? Yeah, I'm feeling very aimless. There was a lot of like, like stuff with in my life that had

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       changed very drastically. A lot of friendships, a lot of stuff like that that had just gotten very weird. And then by the end of the year I was, I just felt so drained and exhausted and miserable. I didn't really know what was going on and that's why the whole like pma things started cause I, I was going into this year, I was like I'm going to make it positive, I'm going to change my mentality and just work towards a better me. So what does PNA mean? Positive mental attitude and what does that, it's just something that kind of gets thrown around to be like keep it positive mental attitude and to me it was something that I could just keep saying to like remind myself to be happier. Like a mantra of something like that. Not to, not to dwell on the bullshit that was happening that really meant nothing in the grand scheme of things.

Speaker 2:          01:32:40       And then because I kept saying a whole bunch, my audience obviously picked up on it and then it's become like a whole like movement on my channel. I was like, okay, I can not, we can wear it around with me. So you, you, you feel that you were, you were able to willfully change your attitude by just consciously forcing herself to be more positive? Not exactly cause I don't, I don't think that's healthy to just, and that was the whole point of it. I was worried that people would be like, yeah, just go out there and be happy. If you're happy then nothing gets you down. So what bullshit. I appreciate that it's more complex than it's about like it's going to sound so hokey. It's about like trying your best to get to a positive mudding in the work to get out of the hole.

Speaker 2:          01:33:24       So for me it was a lot of like starting to go to therapy, like reflecting on things, easing up on my work life and just having a better balance with my mental health and coming to terms because for the longest time I was like, everyone sees me as the positive person, but if I show any sign of like I'm sad, then I was worried I was letting people down. And then that creates anxiety and things like that. So I was like, okay, I'm just going to be open, honest cause I'm going crazy. It's gotta be a burden to be like that positive, happy, energetic guy. Yeah. And then especially when you have people coming to you and be like, man, there's like no drama on you and you're so happy all the time and people have nice things to say about you all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:34:01       And that's just way too much pressure for any person. And it's not true. I'm don't feel like I'm not that all the time. No one's perfect. Yeah. Um, so then just don't try to re reconfigure my brain again as you get to a better place. And because it was a lot of stuff that was like, that meant nothing. It was a lot of very tiny things to kind of build up that mean nothing. And then you get miserable about them for no reason. And then because I have so many people that come to me talking about their mental health all the time, I figured that let's do something better with it. That's what we start doing, the monthly charity streams and then this is like the Hashtag for it every time and try and turn it, turn some turn things into a positive. I think trying to work to a better life.

Speaker 2:          01:34:42       God bless you. I not, I'm an energy to be miserable, sadly. No, I'm in the same head space. You are. I really liked what you said. It's not about like, Hey, I'm happy now. Yeah, it's about you have to make, you have to like make the changes that you know you need to make to get there. I think a lot of youtubers suffer with that because they have everything they need technically or everything they've always wanted. They haven't, you know, it's like why? It's like I have no reason and worst of all, a lot of the fans are people watch or like very judgmental about like what the fuck that you have to complain about and that's the thing when your, when your finances are taken care of and you're your own boss and you're doing a job you love, all that's left is emotional issues.

Speaker 2:          01:35:31       All the things that you have left to worry about or stuff that's all in here and your brain has a lot of shit to you that is not useful at all. And on top of that, millions of people have an opinion about you that you've never met and you have to be their advocate for their mental health a lot of the time as well. And keeping, making sure they are entertained and keeping a check on them and making sure people are okay. And that's why like after awhile it gets you. But yeah, it's nobody can go out there and just be like, okay, I'm going to be happy today because you're a fucking psychopath if you do that. Yeah. Um, but as long as you're trying, like if you have a shit day, it's fine. Sit in Shit Day, allow yourself to feel shit, get it out of your system and move onto the next day.

Speaker 2:          01:36:10       If that shit keep going. If you have a shit month, a shit year, keep going. Eventually that day will arrive where you're happier and it all like, that's the thing. Everyone always says that people get bullied in high school and then they grow up and it's like, yeah, that really meant nothing. Did it? Yeah. It leave some scars if it's bad enough, but then at the end of the day it's like, no, you kept going, you kept fighting and you're at a better place in your life. God bless. I love it. No, I've been, I've been seriously, I've been like, I've been legitimately depressed for like probably two years and that we're just now I'm starting to like address it and that's part of why we're not posting videos on each three because we were just doing too much shit and I was like working every day and like it was getting between me and Isla and you work from home and hobbies.

Speaker 2:          01:36:57       Yeah, exactly. Your free time and you're leisurely time are mixed up cause you were from home and it's just so bad. Yeah. You know you can only take it for so long before you're like, I'm just going to have, I'm just going to disappear forever or I'm going to address this. And that's the, I think that's the problem with youtubers is that when you're on that treadmill and you're constantly working towards it, you feel like if you fall off, you're never gonna be able to get back on again. It's really not true. No, it's not. And you can see channels like Shane Dawson who was, had like huge popularity a few years ago, kind of, he didn't disappear or anything, but it's definitely not. Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's huge. Again, I mean the biggest he's ever been, same with Philly d he was big, went down, that was huge again.

Speaker 2:          01:37:39       And the one that's, well those guys stayed active. The one that always blows my mind is John Tron. Like he doesn't even fucking post a video for a year. You know what I mean? And he comes back and everybody's still there. They'll excited for content. So it's very much that that myth has been busted. Yeah. And that's why a lot of more youtubers are talking about it now cause they feel like they can take a break, but I also take a break and it is really hard to get back to it. Yeah, that's one thing that like when you're in that treadmill, uh, not to chase when you post a video of a week, or at least we used to do once a week, it's Kinda like, it's just the routine and then once you break it, it's like even harder to get back to it. I feel part, the problem for us is that you're always chasing like a feeling or a time of like how it used to be.

Speaker 2:          01:38:28       Yeah. Instead of just embracing like, all right, shit's different now. [inaudible] you know, I didn't mean that's the same for the audience. The audience are still chasing the old use. Yeah. And I think they either mature with you or they leave and shit all over you. Yeah. So you gotta just, I mean, you've been doing it for how long at this point you're not even the salons when you were five years. Yeah. Every person changes like every three years. So yeah. So I think part of what's really important for us is just to be like, okay, that that air has done like as a new, it's a whole new era now because we keep, we've always been like, oh man, I can't do this anymore, but okay now I really needed to get back into doing that again and then it's just like this never ending cycle.

Speaker 2:          01:39:17       Yeah. Let's talk about finding balance and stuff that makes you happy outside of your channel as well. That was like, that was like the thing talking to in therapy I realized that I don't do anything outside of my channel. I don't do anything like physical. Everything's, everything I do is mental. Even if I play video games, it's still keeping your brain on. You need something to let your brain shut the fuck up every now and then. That's something I've been thinking a lot to something. It's like a whole, you need a wholesome activity to do. Just distract your sending the fucking real world like what do you do? Do you have any hobbies outside of work? In Games? Now that I've come here, I've just been hanging out with people a lot more like living in Brighton. I hadn't left my house and like two weeks cause I don't need to write, I have to keep, my video is going and then when I came here I finally had people to hang out with day to day.

Speaker 2:          01:39:59       They've just been hanging out with people all the time, but it's just cleared my head completely. Nice. Well not completely, no, no ever fully clear. But yeah, compared to what it was, I'm so much happier and then it makes it easier to get back into your videos and if you hate doing it the way you're doing, then that's a sign that something has to change. Your schedule changes or your methodology changes or what you're actually doing changes. And the bottom line is if you're not happy doing the old version of you that the audience wants, then it's not worth doing. So you might as well do it. You might as well just do what makes you happy. And if the audience leaves, they leave. If they stay, they stay. You got to make yourself happy first. It's a tough pill to swallow, but it's the truth. Hmm. And something, a lot of people don't want to swallow. Cut the tension. Now we've really talked about everything we really have except one

Speaker 3:          01:40:55       ghost stories. Fuck yeah. Do you believe in ghosts or Ufos or anything paranormal like that? I want to, I'm too rational. I don't, it's fine. It's a weird thing. Like we, we have a habit of asking all of our guests if you have any ghost or Ufo stories that sometimes the answers are quite surprising, but a lot of times they say no and that's the end of it. Okay. So you were full story. I mean not really a alien Ufo, but one time I was out when I was like, well no, like eight to 10 years old. I was out in my backyard in Ireland and we were all outside very late at night in Ireland. You can see all the stars because there's not much light pollution going on. And then all of a sudden my friends were talking and I could hear this like almost like a jet engine sound and I kept getting louder and I like looked up and there was a star in the sky that just got like whiter and brighter and then vanished and all of a sudden the sound was gone.

Speaker 3:          01:41:50       And I was like, that's a, I was an alien dude. I just saw an alien. Huh? How old? Real eight. Nine. Did they see it? No, and I feel like a lunatic thing. I'd love to do that. That's been a, that's cool. Were you guys here like the missile went off that day and the gentle marbles and I can fill in where the ones that somehow like capture that moment. Did you see it in the air? Actually, no. I just saw it all over the news. I think we may have been in New York at the time, right? Oh right. But it was, it just turned out with some missile tests, some shit they didn't tell him that you want to see when you go outside. Do you believe in ghosts and aliens? Don't believe there's aliens visiting there. Yeah. I don't believe in ghosts. I believe there's aliens.

I don't know. Who knows? I might just, if they visited the earth were, where do you think is like the worst place they could land to be like, fuck this. Never coming here again. Hmm. That's a good question. Because like everyone's like, oh, they'll come and they'll go to like dc or New York, like independence day or something. It's like, no, it was a good end up in like, like Zanzibar, somewhere too much anywhere. It's just a shit hole over, I mean to an alien. They're like, what the fuck is this dance in San Bernardino? They land in Greenland and there was just no one. Yeah. Is Weird. Now. This is a very reputable Burbank's the fucking credit theory. There's this place sucks. There's nobody here. Nothing's popping off at bars or anything. Muscle beach. I was just like, oh, I don't want that. All right.
