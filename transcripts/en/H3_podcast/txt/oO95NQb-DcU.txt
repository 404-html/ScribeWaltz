Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Well, hello there. Thanks for joining us today. We're back on this blessing, a beautiful Friday afternoon and America and evening in Europe. Either way, thank you for taking the time to join us here today. Thank you to our sponsors, honey express vpn, me undies and stitch fix. I am happy to announce that on Friday, two Fridays from now, the 30th of November, the great bill works will be here with us, which I'm so excited about. So if you want to leave questions for him on the subreddit, there's a thread up there slash a reproductions. Been a wild week for us here, California. And California's been getting slammed this week. I'm sure you all heard there was. Oh, insane wildfire here in La and Ventura County. And uh, starting with shooting though, we almost didn't even get to pay attention to because of the fire. There's like, the new cycle is like, it's just a tragedy.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       It's sad, sad stuff. So yeah, right around the corner from my parents' house, there was a shooting and thousand nodes and then the neck, the neck night after the fricking whole town's on fire from a wildfire. You know, I read something, I heard something, and correct me if I'm wrong, Dan, but pretty sure this is true. I fact I did fact check it myself. There was one or two people that was in that shooting and thousand oaks that was also in the vegas shooting at him being like, it's like, dude, what? I mean, well that's, that's a mind melt for that person. But uh, I do want to say yeah, my parents were evacuated from their house. They were staying with us. We were, luckily not that close to the fire, but it was smokey and there was ash everywhere. It was really scary. The whole, the main freeway in La, the one on one was shut down.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       I mean, it was, it was apocalyptic out here. It was wild. Um, we just had the news on like the whole weekend. Yeah. I'm going to. Couldn't believe it because it was one day. Just everything's on fire. Yeah. And you don't know if it's, it could spread over to where we live and just, if the wind changes and it goes the wrong direction, you know, but um, we're looking at a place for my parents just a week ago in thousand oaks or it was a Westlake village is where was it? Yeah. And just so we could go and it's this really beautiful little community, the gated community and it's in the woods, kind of in thousand oaks is like a nature preserve. So a lot of the decks and they have trees coming out of the decks and all the trees are marked and it's like a protected area.

Speaker 1:          00:02:48       But I remember being like, man, this is pretty. Like, I feel like a firewood ravage this place pretty easily. I was telling my parents, and that was a week ago, that whole place burned down. But yeah, the whole plate, that whole community burned down. It's crazy stuff. And just, uh, there's a been a real tragic loss of life and property. And uh, I will talk about that more later because there's a lot of amazing footage and stories that came out of that that I think is interesting and I'm crazy wild stuff, dude. But before we get now, as you guys can tell from the title, we have got to address a lot of the criticism that people have been saying against me. A lot of people are tuning in probably to enjoy an epic meltdown for me to wash me, make a fool of myself. So that's why I'm here.

Speaker 1:          00:03:43       Dan doesn't usually. He's, he, he, I sleep through the episode. Yeah, it has it on mute. So I promise we will get to that. I'm just going to be fireworks guys. It's going to be a firewall. But before we get to that, I do want to do a goof for the day to kind of lighten it up a little bit here. What this vape God, the Fda, uh, Tommy the vape God. Somehow this epic troll got on Fox News too, I guess. Uh, he's speaking on behalf of the, how do you call those? Damn the jewels. Yeah. Which is these tiny little vape pen, it's like a pocket vape pen that apparently like in middle school and high school, everybody's hitting these jewels, which is so crazy to me because when I was a kid smoking was already not cool. There was a couple of people that like went out in high school to smoke a cigarette, but now all of a sudden with vaping it's like cool again and these kids are hitting these jewels that like 16 years old. Um, so this, this guy got on the news and it's just instant credit

Speaker 2:          00:04:47       installation specifically with regard to flavored varietals that have helped propelled explosion in the use among the young here. Now to focus on very separate sides of this issue that Schwab is Dr Tom Scott Gabelli, a blogger at barstool sports. Who affectionally goes by the name. Tommy smokes. So because of the videos, the first thing I'm gonna try sick.

Speaker 3:          00:05:16       Yeah. That guy rips that zone and know both. When they give me those, do they think, I really think that Fox News always

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       does this, where they'll bring like I was watching this video during the cabinet, that whole thing, they brought on a guy who says he's an actual, which that does incantations against him and he's like the most absurd looking person you can imagine. It's like they always bring on these people that you can't tell if they're serious or not, which are like the perfect punching band to there. So this guy is a apparently I think she's taking him seriously, which is wild bird song. Joel Kenya.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Wow, that's cool. All right. Sell me on why these flavored e-cigs shouldn't be regulated even, uh, when teens are using them and these increasing numbers will look. I'm 22 years old so I'm using them legally and honestly they're just cool. They're cool. You rip them. There's nothing cooler than blowing a fat cloud. Right? That's truly the Colossus of cloud. It helps my swag, it helps my drip. I just love walking around. It's really good for getting chicks too. So honestly, I started about a year ago and I know that I haven't looked back since I have a question. No, it's. You use your cell phone quite a bit? Yeah, quite a bit. Okay. So why don't you rig it up to your phone and that way you won't have like the, the actual calories burned by grabbing your phone so you can visit

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       what I'm talking about. She completely lost. Wait, where's it gone? Hold on. Whoa. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:06:52       Ape and kind of check email and texts at the same time you have like right off the side. Okay. You could, that'll be your invention. I'm giving it to you so you can vape like this. Yeah, right. Like you don't have to keep switching devices. The humor that.

Speaker 1:          00:07:05       Did she preplanned that gag or what seems like I'm throwing the. She's like, yeah. The whole writing team came together and we decided you should vape betty or phone. Well I don't know if this goes anywhere, but I just wanted to give a shout out to Tommy smokes. The vape. God what a legend. You know, he went out there and Fox and he goes into the lion's den and he and he fought the good fight. He held his own. Yeah, he, he, you know. And for those of you wondering, does vaping help you get checks? Yes. Isla didn't truly loved me until I started blowing fat clouds interface. So shout out to Tommy now. Let's get to the reason we are all here today.

Speaker 1:          00:07:51       I've been thinking a lot about this. Let me take a little sip of water here. This is difficult for me to talk about because it's something I've been thinking a lot about of late trying to wrap my head around it and think about it, you know, honestly and critically and trying to deal with things in a healthier, more mature way. And it's kind of. I have a long winded kind of story here that I hope that will be interesting and maybe helpful for some people. Maybe it helps some people explain and understand where I've been coming from. There's been a lot of criticism of me of late, uh, there's been a lot of people that have said, uh, lots of lots and lots of videos and, um, I have a natural aversion to criticism specifically, which is something that I've been learning about myself through therapy, which I've started recently. And so

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       throughout my career I've.

Speaker 4:          00:09:00       Well, let me start from the top. I'm getting ahead of myself. What do people have been saying about me recently? Okay. That I'm a hypocrite. That I prioritize money over everything else, that I've thrown friends under the bus, that I'm ignorant and poorly informed and spread misinformation that I'm arrogant, that I cannot handle criticism and that I've used to people just to name a couple of the reoccurring themes. I'm sure there's so much more you could say about me. Um, and let me just say this, okay. For the record that I am guilty of all of those things and I'm not going to quantify it or make excuses or anything.

Speaker 4:          00:09:45       I've done those things. I am guilty of those things. And, uh, and this is something that I've been aware of myself over the past couple, last two years or so, is that I have been kind of slipping into a very unhealthy place mentally and uh, I want to try to go through this and make sense of it. Okay. So it's been kind of a slow moving process. It's been like a self fulfilling process in a way where it's gotten worse and worse and I get criticized more and more and I get more defensive or more hold up. And I went and, you know, early on in our youtube career, I went very early on to somebody that was universally liked. I remember in 2016 I could do no wrong on youtube

Speaker 4:          00:10:36       and like on, on Reddit, everybody loved us. We were voted like Reddit, reddit, youtube channel the year or something, 2016. And like the concept of being criticized on, on that level was something I hadn't dealt with. Um, and I think the problem was that I, people had me very high on a pedestal back then. I mean, people thought very highly of me and there's no doubt that at the time it definitely started to go to my head as well and I'm pretty sure, you know, looking back that I started to become more arrogant and overconfident and on some probably deep unconscious level, a feeling of almost infallibility that I could take anything on that. Uh, when I had, I had like this one. I really did. I mean, it's hard to come to terms with that and to confront that because at the time you'll never rationally be like, oh, I'm, I'm out of control. I need to tone it down. Right. And so because of this combination of like overconfidence and feeling like I could take everything on, it led me to make a lot of mistakes. And then when I was criticized for those mistakes, then I would act extremely

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       defensive and nasty and not really processing them in a healthy way. Like for example, the leafy thing was and the Wall Street Journal thing and stuff like this where I kind of just handled things in a really overconfidence, really thinking that I can take on the world. And not and not do wrong. And then when I ended up fucking up and finds out, it comes out. Then when I get criticized, I completely shut down. I really, I have the cycle I'm learning now through therapy, which I've just started doing about a. I've only been doing it for like a month or two, but I have a psychological, a problem where when I went for, for whatever reason that I don't want to get into. But the way I was raised is that when I'm, when I'm criticized, I psychologically shut down. And so before I became like famous on the Internet, I had a problem with criticism, but it was so much less amplified. But kind of like when you become famous, whatever, for lack of a better word, it, it, amplifies certain aspects of, of yourself. And it definitely puts you through a gauntlet of sorts of kind of, um,

Speaker 1:          00:13:13       learning about yourself on an emotional level and brings out all your flaws, amplifies everything. And so that thing of not being able to handle criticism in my personal life was something that I could get by on my life. And not really have any problems, but then when you have like hordes of people on the Internet criticizing Gill, it can get so overwhelming that it actually can cause for me like a real psychological shutdown, which what I mean by that is like, I just feel it feels to me so powerful. Like it feels like somebody died. Like I get so emotionally and so well. The result of that one is like I'm extremely lethargic, like I'll just lay down on the carpet with like, no. Well then the other thing is that like obviously I get super defensive and super irritable and super aggressive towards those that criticized me in a way that's not healthy. And, and instead of learning from criticism, deflecting it all the time and making it the world's problem and not mine. Right? So that's kind of where my head was after these first blunders I made from overconfidence, I would say. And did you know things that I regret. And it shattered my ego in a way. And a real fundamental way that I've also learned about myself is that I'm in my mind. And again, this is through pet therapy that's been really helpful for me, is that I'm in my best, most creative place when I have that confidence and that kind of,

Speaker 1:          00:14:55       uh, not, not a place of a overconfidence or arrogance, but just feeling like that people like what I'm doing, that I like what I'm doing, that it should be a wholesome, great thing. I said that. And so I think that's one of the root problems with why I've had so much trouble creating videos for such a long time is because I've kind of lost my footing. Um, I've lost that wholesome place. And so everything became very difficult for me, having shattered my ego and never having address that or deal with it or confronted it. And so what happened from that is that it changed, it set off a chain event of, of defensive behavior and caused me to be depressed. So I want to make clear that I'm not using depression as an excuse for acting shitty. It's actually the opposite. I was not processing and handling criticism. I was losing my confidence, my ego was shattered and therefore I couldn't make videos. And all this other stuff, and that's what caused the depression. And so what happened now is that the depression actually made everything even worse, right? It made it even harder for me. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       so it got worse and worse. I get criticized more and more. I get more and more defensive and closed up. And uh, I want, I want to make clear, you know, I just kept shoving it all deep down and becoming more and more depressed essentially. And it's only been, uh, recently that I've been. I've kind of hit rock bottom a couple months ago where I was so amped up. I was so, so the depression that amplifies all my negative feelings, right? That's kind of what the problem was. And, and, and worst of all, it made me extremely irritable, which is, if, I don't know if you know, like irritable on that, on that level, but it's the worst. It's the worst because not only do you piss people off, but you start to hate yourself to them because you're, you know, you're acting irrationally. But the emotion is so strong that it's like, it can't be ignored. Like just with Isla, for example, at home, like um, a lot of times when I would get aggravated or upset, I would direct my frustration towards you even though it had nothing to do with you because I was so irritable and I, and I'm up to and in that moment I know that it's fucked up and I'm being an asshole and I hate myself so much for it and I see that it's upsetting you and then you get angry at me. But it's like, it's just this overwhelming Iraq

Speaker 5:          00:17:40       journal and I've even learned irritability. I would know that. It's almost like you're not being yourself right now, but it's such a cycle that I can. I still, I can't not get

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       upset because you're being worse, dude. You being crazy. So I have every right to be upset and we know that and then it's just such a cycle, like, can't get out of it. So because of this crazy irritability, I was really. I'm just making everything more amplified. I was reacting way too strongly and way too negatively lead almost everything. Even the slightest annoyance. I would lash out at things and people that were completely blameless, Super Moody, irritable, guilty, always in my head about something and even a negative comment or somebody even criticizing me and the slightly slightest would like set me off and I would just shut down. Even people that like respectfully would disagree with me, with turn me like bitterly against them. So on so bad, right? I was feeling I was being attacked, like fit. Like it was, like I said, it feels like somebody is dying.

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       I feel like I'm physically being attacked, almost like a flight or fight or flight. Um, so for the longest time being stuck in my head and not being able to. So the first two years I've, I've, I've always felt like I'm not been able to grown or learn or maturing, which is so difficult because I have felt so stuck in like this really dark black hole of negative feelings. Just such an awful place. And being so frustrated [inaudible] I'm like, why am I stuck here? How do I get added here? What do I do about this? And growing more and more desperate, you know, by the week and just falling deeper into that black hole. And so I would say about a month or two are about two, three months ago it was when I kinda hit rock bottom and I was like, it was so. I was just so miserable that I was so tired of being myself that I was willing to do anything to be anything I want.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       I didn't know longer want it to be myself because I was prescribed antidepressants so long time ago. And all throughout my life doctors have been trying to get me to take them. But I've always not wanted to take them. And I think the reason for that is, was probably that will. One of the reasons was that I always felt like I wasn't, hadn't done enough to fix myself. Like I kind of had this unreasonable expectation that I should be exercising two hours every day and eating salad for every meal and that somehow it's going to Jeremiah depression. And until I had done that, then I had no right to take antidepressants. But I think another aspect was that I felt that it was weak or that it was that it would, that I was weak or that it was somehow giving up or that it was, it would change me.

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       I was afraid I'm not a big drug user because I don't like altering my state of mind and I don't like becoming reliant on drugs. But I was afraid that it would change me. And I think at that rock bottom moment I felt so strongly that, you know, what, if it changes me good because I don't want to be this person anymore. Whatever. I remember hearing, I don't know why I was thinking about this quote from Paul Mccartney and John Lennon talked about acid use and Paul said he never really loved it because he was afraid of it changing him. But John loved it so much because he wanted it to change him. And I will always thought how, what an interesting perspective. And I feel like I felt both of their perspectives now, you know, my whole life I was like, I don't. I'm scared to change and that. And then from going from that, like I'll do anything to change. I'm praying that it changes me.

Speaker 1:          00:21:45       So I had this bottle of antidepressants and my bedside and I said, you know, after dealing with this and hitting rock bottom, I just, I started taking it. Um, I just, I had nothing to lose and I couldn't really go on anymore like that. And so, you know, I was, I'll say this, the antidepressant is not at all what I thought it would be. The first two to three weeks was a little rough, I think as your body adjusts to their medicine because there was kind of, well, first of all I was in such a bad place mentally. It's Kinda hard to tell what was going on in my mind and what I was feeling. But it definitely made me feel kinda like foggy and loopy and zoned out. I'm really zoned out. Like sometimes I would just be like,

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       just not just totally absent. I can remember once in the driving lot of Ralph's, we're driving and like, um, there was some, uh, crossing the street and you're almost done instead. Well, I was driving super slow and he was walking slow watching my car so I was ever going to hit him because he saw me coming, but like he was standing there waiting for me to stop for him and I was staring right at him, but I was just inching forward and I just was like, are you going to stop? And I was like, what he taught and I just, I didn't see it. I was just so, like. So I almost, I actually almost gave up on the antidepressant. Uh, there was a time where I was like, oh, this sucks.

Speaker 1:          00:23:25       But then I would say around like three or four weeks because everybody says it can be rough in the beginning. And then it starts to work after like three or four weeks and the side effects go away. I had a lot of anxiety too about being able to perform, being able to come out in the podcast. We're make videos and feel like I'm myself. And I kind of proved to myself that I was capable of that, that he's a lot of my anxiety about taking it to. But what I noticed about the anti depressant after all the side effects went away and the fogginess and all this annoying stuff is that I was, it's Kinda, it's kind of crazy. But I was not irritable anymore. Yeah. I was still depressed. I was still anxious. I was still miserable. But what it did for me that has been so amazing and I'm so thankful for is that it first of all remove the irrational irritability and kind of gave me the foundation and the tools to start seeing things more for what they are

Speaker 6:          00:24:32       and not

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       this kind of crazy irrational, irritable madness that I was experiencing the world through. And so that for me was the first huge breakthrough I had in dealing with my situation. And I would just notice it and things mostly at home with Isla and stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:24:55       Yeah. Things that usually cause somehow fight for no reason. All of a sudden we were like, Oh wow, we did this without Friday.

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       I didn't even get a little. Yeah, almost removed my irritability completely. And I'm telling you this was

Speaker 6:          00:25:12       like

Speaker 1:          00:25:14       a godsend. I mean life changing, really life changing. And it hasn't changed anything else. I'm calm. I'm completely the same. I'm just less irritable and it's just, it's amazing what I learned about antidepressants that it just, all it does is blocks to your serotonin receivers. So there, as I understand it, and I could be wrong about this, but it's called a serotonin uptake inhibitor and so your body produces serotonin, which regulate your mood and your happiness and contentness and stuff like that. And so this drug blocks the receptor that absorbs the Serotonin, so it makes more serotonin available for your brain. Teasers. So. So, um, so it just makes you a little more. You're, it's, it makes your moods a little better. Really. I began for me, it didn't change me at all except that my irritability completely went away. And so things that were making me crazy before I was able to see it for what it was, which I cannot.

Speaker 5:          00:26:18       Just little things like it's just irrational. So all of a sudden you see it as like, oh, it's just a little thing. It's not there. You know, where before it would set you off into like ruin my day, running your day

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       or we will get in a fight and then it would ruin and then I would feel bad about making, about snapping at you. And it was. But like how was it for you? And when I started like,

Speaker 5:          00:26:39       yeah, I noticed it immediately. All of a sudden like it's almost like we switched all of a sudden ICM, irritable compared to you. I know, I know that like I'm not an irritable person, I think. No you're not. You've always been like super sane and grounded and, and great. And I and I, I wouldn't notice situations where I was like, so it's like we switched a little bit because I would be like, oh, come on, something that would upset me. And you're like, eh, it's fine. Yeah. So, but you're certainly. Yeah, definitely. But you're the same person. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       So that was the first really important step for me because I could now see things clear. I could analyze things, clear and boy, what a difference. I mean, my goodness, there's so much stigma against antidepressants and I really, truly, and I, and I was guilty of that

Speaker 5:          00:27:32       two I taught, you know, Eh, you don't want to take it if you don't have to. I don't even know why they had that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       Well, if there is like you're a, you feel almost like a loser, like you're weak. Like you failed to solve your own issues. Now before we started doing youtube and stuff, I wasn't that irritable. Right? No. So was, it kind of made me feel more like how I used to remember being in a sense that I, I always prided myself on being a more calm, rational, rational, rational person and that kind of the self image I had kind of melted away and replaced me with this really grumpy, obnoxious person that I was starting to hate

Speaker 1:          00:28:16       so that, that was huge. I mean, that's huge and I'm still on it and I'm so happy that I'm taking it. I remember in college once there was, um, I was having awful anxiety and you guys might know I had like generalized anxiety disorder. I could have benefited so much from antidepressants in college and I remember there was a sign at my very progressive school ucse and it said something like, it had like Prozac and PROZAC nation making some artsy claim that like, oh, we're all overmedicated and we're all on PROZAC. And the undertone being like, you don't need this, you're weak, you're a sucker if you take it. And I remember seeing that being like, yeah, that's interesting. Who needs that shit? And um, that was a very popular sentiment. I would say very. It was kind of like a anti-corporate, like anti, like we don't need your medicine.

Speaker 1:          00:29:11       Also, I'm, I'm a person that's very, like I said, I have, I have an ego problem. And so admitting to myself that I'm weak and that I need the help of a medicine for me was difficult to [inaudible] was difficult to accept because it's in a sense felt like a weakness that I couldn't handle it myself. The truth is about that, that I've learned is that looking, reaching out for help outside yourself as the first and the most important step and recovering from a situation like this because it's not a weakness, it's, it's truly a strength because you have to get over your own ego and you have to accept the grace and the help of other people and the tools. I mean, this is a well researched, funded, backed by an incredible intelligent researchers and doctors and psychiatrists. And to just write that off because you, it's like, I mean, that's, that's stupid. That's not strength. That's dumb. Right? So that was one aspect and now I'm, the antidepressants are helping but I'm obviously still depressed and I am still, you know, not cured by any means.

Speaker 7:          00:30:39       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       excuse me. So what was the next really important step is that I was recommended a therapist from a friend that I've been doing for about like a, probably about a month or two months, a month and a half. And um, the therapy has been. I've always been skeptical about therapy too. I think probably for the wrong reasons because it feels like week to say to another person, I need help.

Speaker 7:          00:31:16       No,

Speaker 1:          00:31:18       but again, it's like to think that you can. You cannot. It's so hard to understand what's going on in your own mind. Like again, therapist, this. My doctor is a phd. I mean this guy has learned, studied, schooled. This guy knows how the mind works and he's trained to diagnose it and to almost debug it.

Speaker 5:          00:31:39       I think it's probably seen so many people in so many patterns can immediately like, yeah, put together something from what you're describing that you would never even see. Yeah, he's seen it all man,

Speaker 1:          00:31:53       but the thing that like stuff from my childhood and the way I was raised and the way that I reacted things, there's psychological explanations that are so important to explore so that you can deepen your understanding of not only yourself but the world that gives you this incredible empathy for how other people's minds work and how they're affected by their environment. And as I touched on earlier, there is a very good psychological explanation for why I get so defensive and shut down from criticism that I don't want really need to get into. It was just goes back to the way I was raised. But just learning about that and knowing about that and talking about it is so therapeutic and it's so important that it's given me such a good vantage point and it's given me kind of the tools and a little more support and foundation to talk to even come here and talk to you guys about this like this now and to think about it more of a healthy way and to

Speaker 6:          00:32:56       um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:57       it'll last time I came in here and address Chris and all the podcasts I was ranting and raving and going look in like a freaking lunatic. And,

Speaker 6:          00:33:07       and, um,

Speaker 1:          00:33:10       that's just the symptom of everything that I was describing. And so for me, being able to come here and talk about this with you guys I think is important for me because I see the podcast as if nothing else honest. You know, like when I sit here for two hours, live, unedited over the course of nearly 100 episodes, now 100 and hundreds of hours of footage of me unedited. It's nothing else but at least honest, right? Because I cannot hide who I am. I cannot hide my defects, cannot hide my stupid comments. I cannot hide my um, short temper. My dushene is my shitty hosting it, you know, if I, if I recorded this and put it into a video, I would cut all that shit out.

Speaker 5:          00:34:02       Yeah. Or like you, you'll try a joke. And they were like, well that didn't come off right. So let's do it again. But here you don't even to. And you can't know.

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       And to be honest with you, it's, this podcast has been one of the most difficult things I've ever done in my life. Like physically, if you talk about it from the standpoint of just sitting and doing it, it looks like, um, it's easy to do. Just sit here, you show up, you talk and you know, but from a psychological, from a mental, from a, from a lot of other positions, this is the hardest thing I've ever had to do because one,

Speaker 6:          00:34:43       um,

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       there's no take backs and so not only are you, the fans forced to see me more clearly of who I am, but I am forced to see them more clearly of who I am because I'm someone that's criticized youtubers and people on Youtube, you know, what you see, it's very people, it's very nice when you post videos and you can manage your it and put it out and you put it out for the people to see you one way and you get to see yourself one way too because you cut out the stupid shit and you forget about it. And then people see the video and they're like, this guy, this guy is great. And you're like, yeah, I am great. And you forget about you while you're kind of a fucking asshole. You're an hour of you being an asshole and then 10 minutes over your bearing. Good. Exactly. And so,

Speaker 6:          00:35:32       um,

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       I'm not surprised that so many people have watched his podcast and been like, Whoa, that's not the guy I thought he was or people who are making videos about like all the things I mentioned because yeah, it's, it is all in here. Everything you guys have said bad about me and that you've noticed all my bad personality traits and all that it is. It's all in here, you know, I can't lie about that stuff. It's all here. So it's been difficult, especially with this condition I've had of being like depressed and irritable and having a psychological Lee, a unhealthy response to criticism, but it's all played out here

Speaker 5:          00:36:19       and, and it's Kinda the only way to do the podcast. Like our first five episodes. Maybe we were trying to edit it down the footage and thinking about it. Like we used to think about a video but it just wasn't right. Like, you're cutting now in conversation and then you're making decisions on what to live and it's not natural. Exactly. We came to the conclusion that it has to be like this. That's, that's right.

Speaker 1:          00:36:45       It's a podcast. Needs to be honest, it needs to be uncut because you've got to see the essence and the soul of what's there. A lot of times, like you were saying, you though we would try to cut out a part of me saying something stupid or are not just me, but the gas stove.

Speaker 5:          00:36:59       We're like, oh, this is a boring moment.

Speaker 1:          00:37:02       And um, that's just, I think a lot of people were feeling and we're feeling that, that it's like, this is a weird. And so we took this leap into doing it live and it's been really tough and really challenging and

Speaker 6:          00:37:15       um,

Speaker 1:          00:37:17       very exposing of me. I'm here bare naked in a way. But I also think it's been really amazing for me too because it's kind of brought me here now where I've been able to just take finally a close look at myself and see it for 'em, see it more clearly in a way that I've craved so much these past two years to just feel like I'm maturing and I'm growing and I'm becoming a better, more wholesome person. And I'm just stuck. I'm just like, why am I so fucking stuck with trying to be crazy?

Speaker 5:          00:37:54       Yeah, you would say that to me a lot to stop. I just feel like I'm stuck.

Speaker 1:          00:38:01       That's where or how or where, but just feeling like I'm just pinned to the floor or you know, in a way in a hamster wheel.

Speaker 6:          00:38:11       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       but I think it's been a, it's been an amazing experience in that way that we've all, we've all been just, you know, here. Here it is. I said those things, I did those things. I am that person

Speaker 1:          00:38:30       and it's good. It's good to acknowledge that and feel that and be like a, you know, it's good. You got to, you got to accept that catches walk blindly. And I mean it's just so messed up, dude. Like I said, it's just a black hole and it's not, it's just what I didn't understand. It's just, it's strength. It's not weakness to come before yourself and confront your many shortcomings as a human being instead of ignoring them. And I think I was just, I couldn't. It was too painful for me too. It was, my ego was hurt and I was just too painful for me.

Speaker 6:          00:39:17       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       it's so weird. The psychology of it is so weird. You know, you think it'd be so easy to just be like, yeah, you're right. You know, I fucked up, but it can be so painful. As Elton John Famously said, sorry. Seems to be the hardest word.

Speaker 6:          00:39:41       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:39:43       yeah. I don't know why. So it can be so hard. Maybe not for other people, but again, this is my specific problem. I think that I'm now learning about myself. And I said the Ila something recently, I'm still depressed, but for the first time in such a long time, I feel like there's a light at the end of the tunnel, which for me it was this black hole. There was no escape, there was no answer. All I could think of was just permanent darkness. And now a subtle name with the help of friends, with the help of therapy, with the help of antidepressants, with the help of Isla has been with me this whole time. There's just finally I can kind of see a path forward to getting better, a path to walk towards the light, you know, and you know, with a kid on the way, my God, I don't want to be, I want to be better than this, right? Like asking them to be tough, tough enough. I don't need to make it harder. Um, I, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:41:09       I want to say, you know, I readily admit that I've been at times the awful host, a terrible interviewer here, the awful habits as a podcast host, um, you know, speak on things that I don't know nearly enough about. Speak with certainty about things that I shouldn't and I definitely need to do better on these fronts. I need to be better, I need to do better and I expect myself and I want to be better. I've been, you know, I've heard someone say, I forget who said it, but they said if you're under a hundred podcasts, then you really have no idea what you're doing. And I really hope that's true because we're co, this is number 93 and I know I still have so much to learn and improve as a person, as a host, as an entertainer, as a human being, and we only have seven figures now and yet, despite all that, so many of you have continued to support us and show us love and appreciation and to see the goodness and the sweetness end me despite my best efforts to thwart you at times. I think part of me was so I was so, um, felt so distance from the fans in a way recently because on one hand there's people that hate me. And so I'm like, Oh fuck them. I don't even want to read the comment because I'm too fragile. And then the people that love me, I feel like because I hated myself and didn't love myself, that the love that they will show me wasn't genuine, that I couldn't accept it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:48       It was just them being nice or whatever. I don't know. And so I think that, yeah, I just, I dunno, I couldn't accept any of it. It was just too much for me, but I do want to say that from the most sincere and appreciative plates for the people that have continued to believe in me and see something good in me and something here that you like, that it is amazing and it means so much to me and I wanted to thank you all for your kind comments on the episode before the Tom and Christina episode. I had made a side that nobody seemed to like the podcast when there was a huge outpouring of love and support and the column is telling me that I should keep it up and that you guys love it. That was unexpected and very much appreciated and a time that I really needed to hear that. I have thought about quitting the podcasts honestly. A lot. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:43:48       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       because it's been such a pain, you know, it's been such a pan. It's been so painful at times, but I hope there's been good things. It's easy to focus on the pain and the field of pain and talk about the Pan, but I hope there's also

Speaker 6:          00:44:06       no

Speaker 1:          00:44:09       another side to it. And if you do see that side, I thank you so much for sticking with us. And in closing to this long monologue, which has gone quite a bit longer than I expected. Um, I wanna say that if I have disappointed you, I'm sorry, I know I can be better

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       and I want to be better. And to those that have continued to support us and spend your Friday, your blessing Fridays here with us. I want to say thank you for believing in me and looking past my imperfections and giving me the strength and support to push through it. And I do think that it's important for me to talk about these things because I think there's a lot of people out there that can relate to my feelings of this whole depressive attitude and putting off getting help. Because somehow for whatever reason in your head, I'm sure everyone has their own reasons, but that it makes you vulnerable or weak or whatever it is. But I hope that people can take anything from this. That it's actually your weakness and your vulnerability is part of what makes you human. And acknowledging that and reaching out to help his strength, not weakness, weakness is shutting yourself off from the world. And then you can fix all your own problems. That's just bitter self-loathing weakness. And I hope that, um, anyone out there that is feeling, you know, feeling anything similar to what I said that you do try antidepressants and therapy. There's a reason they're studied, developed and used by millions of people. And professions is a science. This is a discipline. Um, these people are amazing and they're here to help you.

Speaker 6:          00:46:05       Um, yeah. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:46:11       anyway, I don't know. I hope that was interesting. At least. I don't know if that's what you all wanted to hear for me,

Speaker 6:          00:46:20       but that's it.

Speaker 4:          00:46:29       What do you think you'll, um, anyway, thank you guys all for listening and bearing with me through that.

Speaker 6:          00:46:40       Um,

Speaker 4:          00:46:43       so love y'all. And we will be right back after this short break.

You know in the spirit of uplifting you all this podcast and keeping spirits high. I will not talk about the fires. Devastating this state until we've asked a funny video first. Okay, now, fair deal. Do you want to watch a wedding dress explode or. My new favorite show now on to Tlc is the best network on television. Every show is an absolute golden nuggets. You know what we're watching like a wedding, Jessica. So 90 Day fiance, as you guys know, is my new passion in life, but I have to wait a week and spending time on the fabric. Dude, I'm in so deep and that is like gun a

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       ula, Larissa and they are in jail and I'm like, who are you talking about? And there's like 90 day fiance. Oh, okay. It's fascinating. Right. But you talk about them like it's a because it's, I'm really mad, so freaking amazing. And like there's this really vibrant community on Reddit of 90 day fiance and they've got all these great memes and discussions and it's fantastic. It's so good. But I need something to watch in the week between. And so the new show that I've found is called extreme cheapskates. Now these people are cheap on a level that is probably should be classified as a mental ill because in real it's not like I'm getting what's on sale at Ralph's. It's not like getting these guys like there's a guy and they're like proud of it too. It's very interesting. They're all, they're all, they all have significant others that are super embarrassed by them, which I find.

Speaker 4:          00:54:26       But yeah, and marriage and they seem exactly, they all seem to be in really healthy relationships. But like for example, there's this one guy, he's like 40 and he's retired. He's like, I have financial freedom. I'm retired from being a cheapskate and none of my other friends have this, uh, this freedom in life and this guy spends his whole day biking around for 12 hours, not because he loves biking, but because gas is too expensive, I'm checking phone machines for money, going to diners and checking the cushions for coins and it's like, that doesn't sound like financial freedom. That sounds like you could just get a job and work less hours, but they have got like this need to save money in any way. I think it's, it's this need to feel like. I think they got it. They, yeah, they got that one up and I'm the result of some of this stuff is absolutely bananas.

Speaker 4:          00:55:27       So this is one of my favorite guys here. This guy's such a legend. He's a legend that during the first season they only had six episodes of sky was in two of them. By the way, on Amazon videos you can decide to buy a season hd or SD and I went super in the spirit of this. Oh by the way, it's going on there. We were going to make a video and it didn't work out and all this left is a stupid fucking Erica that was going to say you've got to show them. Yes, I love that the video didn't work out, but you're keeping the haircut.

Speaker 4:          00:56:12       We had this whole idea for video was going to be so good and I cut my hair for the reaction and all these sketches and we're sitting down editing it yesterday and I'm just like, we're both like, this isn't good. I just cut my hair for nothing. You know? Sometimes I'll walk outside because I feel completely normal and I'll forget them. My hair looks like this and I'll walk outside without thinking a walk shredder and you just. You're just that guy. I know that. Some days I'll look in the mirror like last night and I'm like, kind of a good luck. Oh No. I'm almost a kind of a good look. Yeah, if it was a little more symmetrical. Yeah. The way we kind of have your head tilted to the camera, that side looks okay, but then you know that it's a problem. Madmax cool. Hipster. Fall out a $5, coffee, coffee.

Speaker 4:          00:57:18       So you know what's been interesting because I buzzed my whole head and I took a fricking razor blade and razor blade my scalp and that was gnarly dude. But it was actually kind of amazing. I have to say. Oh yeah. It was painful. It was bad. I have a new appreciation for people that shaved their heads with razors, but it was kind of Nice. I think I'm going to buzz it all off and bic my whole fricking head. It's like it's such a freedom in a way because your hair's gonna grow back all beautiful and healthy and like how often do you get to see yourself? Just like bawled. Everyone at home is also like, fuck you dude. Every day, every day as well. It's not being bold is not a meme. I'm appropriating bulbs, culture. Um, where was I? Oh yes. Extreme cheapskates. Let's see what we have here. So yeah, I was saying this guy only had six episodes the first season. Oh No. What I was saying is that on Amazon you can buy a season hd or you can buy an SD and save $1 and you have to dig. They have a more options button. You have to go in there. And in the spirit of extreme cheap skating, I saved a dollar on this season. I was very proud and honored with these guys.

Speaker 8:          00:58:45       Most people consider the paper towels and disposable, like reusing spruce it up, bring it back to life through set up. Eva could reuse these paper towels three to five times. Roy estimates that over the last 10 years he saved nearly $2,000 just by reusing paper towels, but he also went down to a federal savings, totally the truth, which are kind of flimsy on these disposables. They get dull. I sharpen them on the striking part of a book of matches. Give them a whole new life when you can't squeeze anymore out. Finished to be emptied. That's the end. And they just toss it away and there's a week's worth still left in there. I buy cheap to ply toilet paper and I get two rolls out of one

Speaker 4:          00:59:42       that I have that I said you need those two plys buddy. Especially at your consumption level. We've seen. Well, what did he eats too in that? Do we have the clip of him at the restaurant? Because I need that one. No, but we haven't done one in the deal. We got to watch that one. This is nothing

Speaker 8:          01:00:04       price. I do not enjoy two ply toilet paper being separate. I just kind of threefold it so that it's a little thicker. His toilet play third is a lot like life in general. The closer you get to the end, the faster it seems to go.

Speaker 4:          01:00:20       That's a pretty well. The funny thing about that I've noticed about these cheapskate, these, uh, cheapskates is that they spent so much time, it cannot be a worthy investment of their time. I guess they don't work. That's the thing. But like the guy will spend an hour d flying and then re rolling a roll of toilet paper to save like, I don't know, twenty five cents or something. And it's like, man, these guys have. But you've got to see this guy at the restaurant because that, that really ain't ain't nothing. Um, let's see here. Extreme cheapskates, why don't I look for it? And you watch that clip where I got it, it's too late and that it's a clip of the movie day. You've got this one.

Speaker 8:          01:01:14       I can't believe Roy brought me to the movies. I haven't been to the movie and I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:01:18       So she's begging him this whole episode to take her on a date night, which I guess they do once a month or is it once a year? Once a month. And so she wants him just to buy them a soda pop and some popcorn. And he's like, well come on baby. What are you crazy? So he has a novel idea that some of you could use at home and yourself.

Speaker 8:          01:01:41       So are you hungry? Yeah, I've told you I wanted something to pass. So Mike could, I haven't been at a big waste of money to buy food at the snack bar with concessions in any movie theater here. Keep it low here. People smuggled food into the movies theaters all the time. I don't like it, but they do it by bringing my own snacks. I save at least another $10.

Speaker 4:          01:02:09       Eating a banana and moving. There is a sad shit. I can imagine. It's like a banana and he's begging him the whole time. I want a and popcorn. You said you didn't want the apple to an apple. I told you what I wanted when I came in and I want to pop corn candy or drink for instance. Well I made a movie like what is even going on in that theater? I think they went to a crazy matinee. They did go. Yeah. They went to like the cheapest show of course. Just completely empty, you know, probably it's like 3:00 PM on a when, I dunno Tuesday, who knows? But here we go.

Speaker 9:          01:03:01       Lucky Day popcorn,

Speaker 8:          01:03:05       there were the garbage. She grabs a bag of popcorn is literally rummaging through the garbage.

Speaker 9:          01:03:13       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:03:13       He does the decency of out at least judgement. The either gives free refills with popcorn and soft drinks. So I found a few containers in the Trish. I appreciate it. That surprised my loving wife. So how this isn't theft by the way. Can't beat that. Yeah, pretty much. I like, uh, he, he pocketed a bunch of straws. Destroyed too. It's just going to ask you for this dry, but you probably wouldn't come on. Oh, nice.

Speaker 4:          01:03:48       Thank you. Wow. You know, this lady at after being together for how long as they have, she knows not to ask questions. She's just like, thank you. You made it happen. It's not probe to deep. Here I am. So they didn't show up, but at the end, on the way out, he fills up the popcorn and the sodium again. The restaurants. Shit is crazy. He goes, I don't, I couldn't find a clip of it. But. Well there's the other family that does it. I saw this is important. You guys might be, I might be a, he's like a borderline freegan. Freegan yeah. Have you ever heard of that before? No. Tell me about Freegan. Freeganism is, uh, is people that um, I don't know if they exclusively are always vegetarians or vegans, but they, they have this philosophy that it's okay to eat anything as long as it is being thrown away. So it's like a whole diet based off of dumpster diving consensually. Here was a guy like that in the show? No, I think this guy is down for anything that's cheap. So this family, is it going to last one? I show you guys, but I urge you all to buy this on SD and save that dollar.

Speaker 4:          01:05:07       So this guy, their house was so wild, so he takes his family out once a year with change. He saves all year to treat them for enduring. Um, so he takes them to a buffet. And uh, this is wonderful. You can imagine the dismay on everyone's faces up to a Chinese buffet.

Speaker 9:          01:05:36       I couldn't believe it. All I could see was food stacked upon each other. We work with fine dining live in the era of the table. What the legend news. You're going to have whatever you want. You guys don't seem very lumpy. You want to sit and talk and you want to leave. We want to leave. Want to go to at least give it a try. We at least agree to give it a try. I guess we're hearing his wife's pond

Speaker 4:          01:06:23       showed up at the last minute thing to always help them out I guess, and they're like, oh, guess I'm aunt Auntie. He's coming with us. And he was like, yeah, this guy's a legend. Lack of appreciation and I'm going to make sure that everybody's happy.

Speaker 9:          01:06:49       Alright, cool. What is that? That's our food.

Speaker 4:          01:06:58       The plates on it was going to pay

Speaker 9:          01:07:02       for three people, but there were six of us. Pay for three. Delicious. I know I got your favorite three plates if I have more than this number of places that you pay for each of us to get the band is the band. That was unacceptable. I was so mortified that he would even suggest it.

Speaker 4:          01:07:26       So the guy we just washed and this guy does the same thing, so at the end of the meal they sharp taken out doggy bags and then everyone in the restaurant who hasn't finished their food, they start hitting them up and saying, can I take this home? That to me was the best part of the show and I don't know why this guy paid in coins too, right? Yeah. And they don't show them pink. He whips out like a panty hose full of entities is so good. You guys gotTa Watch this show every day. Started that Youtube trend of like, huh, they're Bradbury's. We're buying Gucci store with pennies. That guy's like, dude, that's just my life. I'm not even trying to make. What's the prank? Oh, I highly recommend. This show is so entertaining guys. There's so many more great clip. These clubs don't even do. They show justice if I'm being honest, but enough about the funny light hearted stuff. Let's bring it down now. Actually, I do want to talk about the California fires because I have a lot of incredible footage that I want to show you guys. It has been so nuts out here like I want to emphasize how was just one day all good and then in that evening on the news, it was like the whole freaking state was on fire. I heard a stat that up north. That's the campfire, right? Yeah. That this fire was spreading at the rate of one football field. A per.

Speaker 4:          01:09:00       I don't want to say it wrong.

Speaker 4:          01:09:03       One football field per second. What's really? Yeah, that sounds well maybe. Well, well I mean no, it's just hard to fathom it going that fast, but I guess that's probably. Well it explains then why up north especially there's 631 people missing that there's a good chance that their dads, because this fire was moving so fast and so furious that people were chilling at their home or in their car in the mountains and didn't even realize they were in an evacuation zone and then all of a sudden you see some ambulance coming over the ridge and by the time you're packed up on your car, the fires consumed the whole. Yeah, I mean, so there's a town up north paradise paradise. I do ironically named, so this town, it was really beautiful. I love them though with California. Yeah. I mean it's really beautiful and foresty, but the state is so dr from a lack of rainfall that basically everything's just ready to go up, which is what makes these fires so severe.

Speaker 4:          01:10:13       Um, the population was $27,000 and in this city nearly 12,000 homes and other structures were burned down. 12,000. Yeah, it was at 6,000, like the whole city. I mean, like a whole city was burned down. 12,000 homes in other structures and 631 people on accounted for. Seven people died in their cars and paradise. The boys was so hot that aluminum wheels melted. It burned. It burned in paradise up north of 142,000 acres. I have no way to fathom what that means, but I have some videos I want to show of kind of some of these people survived and were unharmed and we had the, there woolsey fire going on in our area and that one seemed crazy. And then once we heard the numbers of the one in the north, it's like, oh my, it was way worse. Destruction there was unbelievable. I think here, because La is so densely populated, the evacuation here was way crazier. There was a hundred and 70,000 people who were under mandatory evacuation.

Speaker 6:          01:11:31       Um,

Speaker 4:          01:11:33       there were 600 structures destroyed and a three fatalities and this fire and the one in La and Ventura County.

Speaker 6:          01:11:43       Um,

Speaker 4:          01:11:45       I want to show some some footage again, all these people that were more. Well here, that's, that's what it was. According to the stats I have in front of me, correct me if I'm wrong. Then those were, uh, I pulled that from CBS News and they published it around noon today. So it's about as up to date. Let me see here. So this is, this stuff is, so it's like out of a movie, like I can't believe this stuff. How does that fall for you, Dan? Is that okay? Yeah. Perfect. Right. So this is just, where was this from? The, this is the Paradise Campfire, the one up north. So you can imagine like, describe it for the, uh, cell. It's that guy. Thank you Dan for reminding me. So this is a guy driving down a road and I mean it's hell fire. She's hell.

Speaker 4:          01:12:33       Fire up in hell. Fire on both sides. Amber, when smoke and it's the highway to hell man. And this fire was so, like I said, spread so fast and so furiously because it was so windy all of a sudden. Yeah. The Santa Ana winds, which is like pressure from hot. I don't know how the science works, would, it gets really windy and really dry and so this guy could very well just be at home not knowing anything is going on and then all of a sudden he's trying to escape. And here this is what it looks like. You can only imagine how hot it would be in that car. A lot of people have met their end when from the car. Literally. That's so horrible. So this is one look here, retard can also just stop at any moment because of the lack of oxygen. It like turns off and you get, you're just stuck there. Yeah. Um, that's all fine. Really horrifying.

Speaker 6:          01:13:34       Um,

Speaker 4:          01:13:35       well also trees could fall on the road. I mean, I never thought of lack of oxygen. No, that's crazy. I don't know which one. Oh, I think this was from Canaan. This is right in hills and move. Drove up and down this road a million times. So how does that frame up? That's okay. Yeah, looks good. She's driving what is usually a really beautiful and scenic road down to the beach, down to Malibu and it's just. Oh yeah, that's the Canon tunnel that drive some of the time. So she's going through a tunnel on the ground and as she emerges on the other side, you can see the amber red go low stretch through a merge. She comes out of the tunnel and it's just like,

Speaker 5:          01:14:26       that's such a scary drive to do it in such a time because it's like you drive to the mountains.

Speaker 4:          01:14:31       There's already they started going to them. Yeah. Oh my God.

Speaker 9:          01:14:39       My.

Speaker 4:          01:14:43       It's just smoke and fire. Amber asked the visibility's lift one foot. You're going to hear the. You can hear the crackling. Wow. How the hell did she record this? That blows my mind that she was able to drive and recording the wheel, you know, and got her phone in the same hand. I mean, um, and then so it looks like she's out because she's in another tunnel and she's coming out and then once again on the other side of the tunnel, it's just endless fire and ash and smoke. She opens the window. You hear that

Speaker 5:          01:15:33       that is the worst road to be on at this time. So, so scary driving on a regular because it's so twist and turn and mountains. And

Speaker 4:          01:15:47       I'm amazed that she was able to record this. I mean, how can you. Yeah. I haven't watched if, but yeah, that's what she makes her. Right? She's fine. I saw an interview with her afterwards. She's laughing about the experience. She's totally fine.

Speaker 9:          01:16:09       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:16:11       But I, I don't wish that experience on anyone. I mean that is so terrifying. Um, but my God, she is a hero for. I mean, imagine you're driving for your life and holding a phone, recording it on one hand. That's something she needs to be like a professional camera lady or something because she's got it. She's got potential. Yeah, incredible stuff. Canaan is a landmark in Los Angeles, is beautiful, really beautiful canyon road that goes down to Malibu beach. So it's weird to think of it from a beautiful scenic route too. A hell fire. So there's more yet. Um, we'll have we here. Uh, I just thought this was so crazy. Here you can see that the freeway full of cars, fire creeping up the side of the cliff and then a helicopter dumping water on the freeway as cars are still on the freeway. I mean the fire spread so fast. They didn't even have time to shut down the freeway and evacuated. So you can see these people. You'll see I'm playing. It's unbelievable. I mean, that's crazy. Look at this. Helicopter is literally dropping water on cars on the freeway. I think if we're going to stay from getting hammered, we probably want to imagine being in that car. You're just like, whoa. Right. And the worst part is that people are stopping the look. So there's traffic like stop and go traffic or right next to the fire. Why would you stop? Would you stop? It's good. I think it looks like what you see this. They're all, they're all right next to the fire. Just stop and go traffic.

Speaker 4:          01:18:03       It's just because they've always done the. Yeah, right there. Who that is so fucking scary. But that's just a testament. Thou fastest thing. A spread. Like look at this just on the fricken freeway. Oh my God. You have a guy actually splashed, drifted. He could see where it was going to drift because of the wind. Crazy. Huh? And I do want to say I was up at 5:00 AM the night that it broke. And these firefighters are freaking amazing. Like being a firefighter in California or any firefighters are amazing. I have a lot of respect for firefighters in general, but these guys were grinding it out. Five am, I'm raging and Friday and they're out there. Uh, all Doug, 24 hours just fighting this shit. I had an, an, a profound appreciation for them. And there was a lot of police involved and a lot of

Speaker 4:          01:19:11       I saw a clip of, and dude I know they say you're supposed to evacuate and everything, but I saw a dude, he had like a, it looked like a pretty poor house and you'd like a farm and animals and shit and his whole neighborhood. I was watching this live last night, not last night when it was happening and his whole neighborhood was engulfed in flames and the dude is just there with a garden hose putting out ambers and it looked like he saved his house man. I mean he was just there with a fricking garden hose, like against this force of nature. So I'm a huge respect for these fricking amazing people out there. And even now the fire is still going, you know, I don't know. It's still, it's still I, I could be wrong band. It's like what? Sixty contained or something. The one close to us. And uh, yeah, I mean the one up north is still raging as well. So that's what you,

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       it's hard to appreciate it. Like now the kind of the dust has settled in the city as fires still raging on and these guys are still fighting it. I just can't imagine that moment you come back to your house and it's gone. Where do you start in?

Speaker 10:         01:20:25       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:20:25       It just look it up. Was he fired? That is 70 percent contained. Uh, the one up north, the campfire. A only 45 percent contain still. Gosh, Gee Whiz.

Speaker 5:          01:20:38       Um, many really luxurious, huge, expensive houses burned down la, like architecture and art and um, and whatnot. Like crazy. I heard that. I hadn't heard if uh, if it had been confirmed whether or not his house survived, but the director, Guillermo del Toro, which you'll, I know you're a huge fan of guy, but he, he has a, a huge, uh, he has a huge private collection of artwork from a lot of really famous artists that in his house. And last thing I thought about when I heard about all day, like I think it burnt. I think I heard of Brian, did he not? That's me. That's crazy. Because he had, he had a bunch of really awesome pieces. I might be wrong about that. Maybe you guys can fact check that. I'm curious. I'm gonna. Look it up. Yeah, I know. That was like, as of a day or two, it's only minor smoke damage.

Speaker 5:          01:21:35       Okay. You miley cyrus lost or have a lot of super rich people, which is good in a way that because these are people that can take it, but on the other good, but they can. Well there their lives are not ruined, but that's not to dismiss the suffering that they'll surely endure from losing all of their worldly belongings. Horrible. Yeah. Can you imagine? Um, and Kanya Kanya hired private firefighters to watch his house and protect his house, which was interesting. God bless him in his neighbors to evidently which, which is the neighbors were thankful for him, but it was his own. Yeah, that's what I meant is that he, he not just to protect us but to protect his whole neighborhood. Yeah. I didn't know you could do that, but I mean that's a little private firefighters. I don't know. That seems 30 old thing. There was saying his house is worth $6 million. So I think when you have found much to protect, well you're saying, you're saying what other people's houses are burning. Well, it's just, you know, you can't afford the private firefighters see your house burns. Is that really fair? I mean, uh, well world isn't fair and army of firefighters. Goddammit. You go for it apparently though, saved this whole neighborhood. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's. I mean that is good. That probably helped the firefighters a lot because they didn't have to come. That's true. Fucking waste

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       resources on.

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       I guess my thought is just how these private firefighters, if nobody pays them, do they just stay at home? And I'm like, well I'm in bed.

Speaker 4:          01:23:12       They're probably not necessarily firefighters just like I'm right now. It's probably like ex military kind of, you know. But uh, I had the same. I had the same. It does sound weird. I'm trying not to be cynical about it because my first impression was like, uh, no. Yeah, exactly what, you must be nice. But on the other hand it's like, you know what, if you got the money, if you got, if you've got it, flaunt it. Oh for sure. I don't blame Kanye for doing it. Hell yeah, but I, I bet you in the end it probably did help the firefighters a lot because they don't have to worry about saving that. He's like, start with my house. But then you know, help other people if you can,

Speaker 4:          01:23:56       you know, I got to say I don't like talking about politics and I don't like talking about trump and I'm not a forest ranger obviously, so I don't know how to analyze this statement, a, the validity of it. But trump's first response and, and as someone that lives here, I want to read this to you, there is no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in California. Oh, thank you. There is no reason is this better? Much better. There's no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars that are given each year with so many lives lost all because of gross mismanagement of the forest remedy now, or no more federal payments. This was his first statement. He did end up saying a lot of Nice things and encouraging stuff, but you know, again, I'm not a park ranger so I can't assess his statements. Uh,

Speaker 5:          01:24:54       all of that might be completely and perfectly valid. Right up to that last sentence where you suddenly threatened pulling funding, like, you know, have that fight after work where we've stopped the fires maybe. Sure.

Speaker 4:          01:25:07       Yeah. My, my, my problem was just like, as someone that lives here is like, I dunno, I feel like the world needs a little more tenderness, more compact, a little more compassion right now. And especially in these times when we're so divided and everything. So political and I don't know, I just felt disappointed that our president was making a political point or using it to make a point or to attack people when people's houses were still borrowing the bore. Dying and fires. I was just like, man, I mean, you, you might be right. I'm not even going to get until trying to analyze who's right and who's wrong, but I just wish that there was more fricking tenderness and compassion and the planet for each other.

Speaker 5:          01:25:50       Right? Yeah. I mean, if there may be a lot of validity to what he's saying about mismanagement and you know, things that can prevent it, but when it's an ongoing disaster, it's not, it's not over like people are still dying and it's

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       like, just, you know, next month, let's talk about that. Let's talk about what we can do better. And Donald trump really is a role model for a lot of people, a lot of people look up to and the ambulance came and I just think, I dunno, it'd be nice to see more compassionate in the world unless of whatever this is. That's all. And so I thought it was relevant, just a little disappointed by buyer leader. I mean he's, he leads all of us, not just his base. He's still the president of California even though Californians hate him in general.

Speaker 6:          01:26:45       So

Speaker 4:          01:26:47       yeah. Um, I definitely am going to donate to support the people that have been affected by this. I was trying to research the best place to do it. The mayor of Sacramento, which is the capital of California and just south of um, this really incredible fire up north,

Speaker 6:          01:27:11       um,

Speaker 4:          01:27:13       straight from the horse's mouth. Is that derogatory? Is that a relevant thing? The horse's mouth gets horses shit straight from the mayor's mouth. If you want to help the victims, please don't send supplies as the evacuation center. Say they have been in undated. Those working on the front line and say that giving to the Red Cross or habitat a.org is the best way to help. So these are some good recommendations from someone directly involved in this to give you some ideas if you want to help. I'm definitely going to donate myself. So there you go. I've just feel awful for everyone. Yeah, it's just, it's just, uh, you know, this, this thing going on a coffee. These wildfires are just. So they've gotten so out of control every season. I was watching a documentary on Netflix that was really interesting about it, about the guy who's been following.

Speaker 4:          01:28:11       I forget the name of it. Maybe you can look it up for me when you guys and out. It's about a documentary crew that follows firefighters over the course of like a whole fire season and the firefighters are saying that in the past like 10, 15 years, it's been getting progressively worse and the season's been getting longer because there's the change in weather and the changing climate has a produced the less rain in California and so everything's more dry and it's just making the fire is way worse. There's a lot of dead trees. There's a lot of dry trees and California, a ton of wilderness. Um, so it's incense from due to the change in weather. Just a huge matchbox, just a huge, uh, so every season like this, this one now la. Yeah, fire chasers. Thank you Dan. On netflix. It was really captivating. Watch. I gotta watch it. Incredible footage. Last year the one in Ventura was the worst in history. It was the most destructive in California history. And now this year the one up north beat that record already and it's still burning Ventura county. I don't know what's going on. Those poor guys, man. I'm from Ventura originally. They're just getting crushed. Man. I feel so bad for them to fires shooting. They had that shooting and the next night before they can even mourn for the loss of like 11 lives. I think it was 12 lines that, uh, the, the fricking counties on fire, same people that needed to more and had to evacuate. Exactly,

Speaker 10:         01:29:55       man.

Speaker 1:          01:29:58       Rough. Probably if I had the guests are a result of all the gay people bringing the wrath of God. I like this. No, there's, there's like all these preachers that say all the fires and everything bad happening in the world is because of gay people. I swear to God, go Westborough Westborough. I mean people like, um,

Speaker 1:          01:30:21       more reputable than that. Like people with actual. I'd have to look into the specifics of it because I don't want to say anything. Not True, but I've seen lots of clips of preachers being like, oh, all the fires out here in California is because of the gays. Eh? You know, when you rub dicks together, what do you expect to happen? When you rub two sticks together, it causes more than just semen to erupt. It causes sparks like sticks, two sticks rubbing together. God said, no. I rub two big sticks and a whole fire burned estate down. If that ain't the got gazed and I don't know what it is.

Speaker 1:          01:31:05       That's why God says use Lube, because if you rubbed Dick Dry, you could burn the whole state. Oh, that's a good point. We're talking about. I said something. Oh, Ilos got where it is. Pastor. Blame scalpel all over this. Let's see. A pasture blames California offers on states embrace me of Lgbtq Center. A reasonable stance right there. Now trump says that it's because of the poor forest management and the liberal ses because of climate change, but I have an alternate theory that it's a that gaze when two men rob dix together, it can cause more than just ejaculate

Speaker 1:          01:31:50       known for inflammatory claims. A pasture. Kevin Swanson, a little subtle upon their inflammatory claims. Maybe it is a little fun with it. Yeah. Pasture. Kevin Swanson is drawing a link between California's devastating wildfires and the states embrace of same sex marriages. Well, it sounds foolproof. Wrap it up with God's punishment of the Golden State for legitimizing the sin of homosexuality. Imagine being God and you hate gay people that much. The Gay God must be really closeted or something because he hates gays like way too much. The first gay pride March occurred in San Francisco in 1970, and then San Francisco legitimize homosexuality in 1972. He said in 2005 California state legislators became the first state in the nation to pass the same sex marriage law. Two thousand 18. Well, okay, you got to have to draw more correlation than that. What is Jim Baker's? Zach priest was similar views. Other one. You guys find a video. I want to watch a video of one of these guys. Sure. Now, now a lot of people say that climate change is making the state dry, but what I say is that it's drag butthole that's causing a fires. What I say is that the gay people, I haven't way too much fun and it's causing all these Dang fys.

Speaker 1:          01:33:26       Please donate to my church because I needed another private jet.

Speaker 1:          01:33:35       Uh, what else we got here? Folks? We got, um, what the F we got, men with beards are more attractive than those who are clean shaven, really real. And who study finds hung. Dan, have you found that to be the case? You seem shocked by that. Well, you know, all of us as having a beard that helps you. There are statistical outliers I guess. Well, just imagine how bad, how rough it'd be if you were shaving. Well, that's true. That's a good point. I mean, have you gone, have you been beard lists? Uh, in the past and uh, to be honest, very rarely, not since I was a teenager. Basically I've, I've had a beard while I was continuously. I've had a beard pretty much since I could. And I'll tell you that when I clean shave I feel like a monster. I feel good. I also really like, if you'll come to kiss me or something, it feels horrible too. You don't want your perfectly, it becomes like sandpaper. I hate it, but the thing, I think the real ticket from it, well this guy's handsome as fuck with or without a beard. So I mean, you know, a guy like me on be like,

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       here he is with no like, but for me personally, they did a study and they showed how much are you likely to want to fuck this guy? They just showed people probably, you know, random guys.

Speaker 4:          01:35:11       But I do think in my case, the beard, it just hides my face and I'm going to be honest and it's fine. I'm not that insecure about how ugly I am. That is one thing I'm comfortable with. But if you criticize me I'll shut down. But um,

Speaker 5:          01:35:26       I don't know if that's what it is.

Speaker 4:          01:35:28       Covers my face. I to, I, my details are not that good. I've got a tiny chin. I've got chubby cheeks. Everything going on here is not beautiful. Chiseled. I don't look like superman or wherever this ass. That's the 50 shades covered as much as possible. You can see my nose, my eyes, my eyebrows. That's okay.

Speaker 5:          01:35:48       I don't know if that's what it is, but I agree with the. Went to stay with the premise of this. Don't you think I look better with a beard? Yeah. And it looks horrified when I shave. No, I think that about everybody. No, I think I do think that it looks better not, and I don't like a longer beard though, that I know there's a certain point. Well, that's actually what the study found to right, that, uh, they, they check about that. I will. Let me, let me read. There's, there's, there's four tiers. There's like clean shaven, a little bit of stubble, a decent amount of stubble. And then like a full beard and the decent amount of stubble, which I think was 10 days. No shaving. That was the sexiness. Let me read this for you guys.

Speaker 4:          01:36:27       Men who have full beards are seen as more attractive than men who have just a light stubble according to results of a new study that don't say what this study is. So I don't know if it's a reputable in any way, but it makes sense. Researchers found the widely celebrated attractiveness of bearded stars like Jamie Dorman, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Chris Hemsworth is apparently no coincidence.

Speaker 5:          01:36:51       Doesn't hurt that they're incredibly handsome as well. Exactly. The most beautiful men in the world are found a track, although could that be a cultural phenomenon because I feel like in the fifties, having a beard was seen as kind of a trend. Right now. You know, I think it's a beards are. That's kind of like a new thing to come back if I, if I'm not mistaken, you know, it definitely became like super hipster guy with the long beard to buy like beard oils.

Speaker 4:          01:37:20       Let's see. As part of the experiment, Male subjects were photographed clean shaven five days after shaving 10 days, and then after a whole four weeks without shaving a 8,500 women were asked to rate them in on attractiveness

Speaker 4:          01:37:36       as a longterm romantic partner. Heavy stubble 10 days was found most attractive while fold. Beard's grown over four weeks came second. Oh Wow. They like the full even more than the light stubble stubble was third while clean shaven was ranked the least attractive. Margaret. No. Shaving is so annoying. I hate shaving to the skin on my face and a lot because it irritates your skin. I feel like that's part of why I don't like it too, because I know that it's, it doesn't look comfortable. I like, like you shaved your legs. Imagine doing on your face. I mean, Geez Louise. I'd like raising like some parts, like my neck and the back. I use a razor for the back of my neck in the shower. That's changed my life. But the, this is so. The reason I grew a beard to begin with is because it's so irritable. I keep getting like pimples and cried out and oily. The whole God damn thing

Speaker 5:          01:38:32       river. Uh, I know this weird question, but have you ever had a professional shave where they use like a straight razor and somebody does it for you? I don't know that I have Dan. And that's so strange that you would ask that. No, I'm kidding. That wasn't that weird of a question. It's honestly, I did. It was nice. It was awesome. And it doesn't irritate you. I mean that's the biggest thing is the razor is so sharp that it doesn't make you break out the way a normal radio. I do have a fear during that procedure that they're going to slit your neck. Yeah. Sweeney todd style. Just fucking down the rational fear that they'll just be like, whoops. Got Him. I was nervous. It is freaky. I mean, I've got a guy with a razor sharp utensil to your neck. It's a. it's a little uncomfortable, but seems nice. I would go for that. This article is on Yahoo style blue.com. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:39:32       I love all these tech companies trying to like exist in the shadow of Google. Yeah. Was style. Um, but the research paper concludes that beards consistently render men with an older, more masculine socially dominant and aggressive appearance. Oh Damn. Girls are fucking crazy. I want a man that's aggressive and dominant beers maybe more attractive to women when considering long term than short term relationship. I'm looking for a man that's socially dominant and aggressive for a longterm relationship as they indicate a male's ability to sex successfully compete socially with other males for resources. I think you're looking way too much into this.

Speaker 5:          01:40:15       Yeah. Yeah. That time. I think it's a fad.

Speaker 4:          01:40:19       Of course not everyone can grow a full beard. It all depends if it suits you. Okay. Whatever. Tell him, uh, what else is google style? Got To tell me about the word. Do we have any clips of those crazy preachers?

Speaker 5:          01:40:38       I was trying to find this Jim Baker Guy, um, but can't seem to find any evidence. So Jim Baker, if we've, if we've a solid your name unfairly, we apologize. You may or may not

Speaker 4:          01:40:51       gave people. Now many think that, uh, whatever, it's such a stupid. And even many people think that you don't think I should continue with the whole preacher thing or no els hitting the board on that one. In the crickets. Yeah. Okay. Hit me with the crickets. Yeah. Many people think the blame. I say being gay is fine. Just as long as you lose you loop. When you rub your sticks together, you can hit me with the cricket on you. Bended. Tom and Christina were at the thought of cricket. They were like, so they were both had this visceral like what? It's funny too, because I, I don't have that problem. I know. It's funny. It's amazing to see they both really like recoil at the sound of the crickets. That's amazing. I love those guys. They're so freaking awesome, aren't they? Yes, they are. What else we got here? Oh, we got some. Should we go onto fan submissions? We're at an hour 45. Yeah. It's time. Uh, Joshua mccardy says hi. I'm a big fan of the show and thought I would suggest showing this gem of a video. I'm from eastern Kentucky and my local news station had a segment about a robbery. I won't say anymore, but encourage you to watch and enjoy.

Speaker 4:          01:42:24       Thank you josh. Wall for thinking about it. Getting some really great clips from. Yeah. I want to say guys

Speaker 4:          01:42:33       keep sending shit to podcasts at h three h three productions because there's been some absolutely great stuff there. I want everything. I want questions you want to advice you have any reaction, any suggestions for a reaction? Videos you like, what you see? Um, it always looks good on that. I was saying when I looked in the mirror last time, I was like, damn boy, I have you turn your head all your hair like that. No, you wouldn't. No, no. I don't know what you think I could walk down. You agreed that it almost looks good. So what I mean is that it looks like a style. Yeah. Yeah. I think I could get away with it. Honestly. It's just not. Not, not the side you're showing us right now. Not that one. And yeah, maybe not that. It looks like you evacuated. Well getting a haircut. It's just not my style. I'm not, I'm not. I'm not slamming the style. It's just not my style. Yeah, that's all. But I actually, it was, I swear to God, it felt so good to do it all the way down. It's really, really amazing. It grows so fast, so it's already like it was the skin two days ago. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:43:48       Huh. I wonder if there's a research about the hair stubble research found that men were more attractive when they weren't completely bald to the skin.

Speaker 4:          01:44:01       Zach just pointed out, you actually looked like the dude from the dude, from his Robert Deniro, from taxi driver. Yeah, I know. We wrote out a bunch of them. We had a bunch of hair. That was one of the insults. I have my, we had a, I looked like Mr. Cleans inbred cousin. And then how do you look like a, how do you look like a Jew and a Nazi at the same time? Yeah. But that was really. And they were, it looked like it when it was super skinhead. Um, we had a lot more. Um, you look like a

Speaker 4:          01:44:35       definitely taxi driver reference at the end there. God torturing people. People are going to be demanding this video now. In the end it was really bad. You're not missing anything folks. The haircuts, the best part. You're getting all the good names. Um, what else? There were so many. Let me just, I'm going to look like where we got nothing to do. We're at the end of this video. Our fans. We have this video. No, I'm going to wash that. I just, I want to at least, uh, enjoy. What little jokes I want to salvage, whatever I can from this. There wasn't much more than what we said. Let's see. Uh, you look like a 90 villain extra. Yeah. A little bit. Those were all meant for me to say to you look like a dollar store. Zurich from Fifth Element.

Speaker 4:          01:45:22       I think my favorite is how do you look like a Jew and skin at the same time. And Mr. Cleans inbred cousins. Yeah. Yeah. That's all. I got guys, great video that I just gave you the highlights. We can just clip this and putting this on our main channel, but hopefully we're going to start over and why couldn't you have video, new subject, new everything and hopefully I can leverage this haircut into a new joke because I don't want to waste a broccoli assassin. Cut for now. I was calling this the carat cut because the Broccoli was more about the crown. Carrot is more about the stem. It's like a carrot cut. If I had spray Tan, it could be a real character, but like a nice orange. You. What could make that happen? All right, let's watch this. Thank you too for your submission. Uh, Joshua,

Speaker 5:          01:46:22       your home is never a good idea of floyd county man found that out for himself after having a gun pointed at him when he did. Just that way. Empty Sean Allen talk with the victim. In that case we'll say math is on the rise. Math as a result. So it must've been a bad batch around here called forward. Counties went crazy in the last four days. Neighbors notify Mason Tackett that his cousin, Phillip, Matthew Higgins was seen carrying items from his house

Speaker 11:         01:46:53       when I finally got down here and for the house to look. So you walk out the door was standing wide open. It looked like he was packing up for yard sale.

Speaker 5:          01:47:01       You got my fan by the way. They wanted hagans

Speaker 1:          01:47:05       cracks me up. What is he like one inch tall? It's like a chase through grant. It's like from his perspective,

Speaker 5:          01:47:19       no, it's not that everybody else wants Tackett found items belonging to him.

Speaker 11:         01:47:32       Pull a gun on me when I got back around the house because I guess he thought I was upset with him.

Speaker 5:          01:47:37       Items not normally. The target of the would be burglar who steals a cheese grater. She's got the worst. He stole the empty bottle of was my soap stone massage. I still feel the pagans is charged with receiving stolen property and being a convicted felon with a firearm in Turkey creek. Sean Allen, way empty mountain. New Tech. It hard to believe that it's not a sketch. Still be stolen. Who steals a cheese grater? That guy's awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:48:16       His accent is amazing. It's amazing. What did you say? Kentucky. Kentucky. Go lead. I feel like that deserves a golly. I feel like that deserves a jimminy cricket

Speaker 1:          01:48:32       and really you could say anything with that. Excellent. And it would be fun and amazing. I'll tell you what. No thank you. Say hit me with that cricket. You got to just using it after he hit me, like I really don't mind that either. Can't use it anymore. So I'll lead jimminy cricket. Who steals a cheese grater? He stole my Nana's. I gotta find something, you know, a boo just Bu. Um, this was an interesting story. Taylor swift apparently used to travel in a suitcase to avoid hopper Razzi. Now Taylor swift is one of the most famous people in the world. And so I can understand that, uh, trying to avoid popper Razzi was probably a source of great discomfort and a and annoyance to her to say that lead, but the, the level that she went to to avoid them was amazing. And I want to say is a testament to how annoying these people are. Rather than that, it should reflect poorly on her. That being

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       said, it is incredible. Uh, Zane, this was the one direction. Confirm. Keep confronting winter. So this guy from Zane says Taylor swift was traveling around a suitcase during the summer of 2007. Um, and so he, I love the heat. So here it is. Here's the alleged suitcase

Speaker 5:          01:50:12       the other day explained to me that this was actually a rumor at the time and was like, dismissed as just being kind of a meme, but it's just way too over the top to be real. But now evidently this guy saying, no, you don't. This is all really happening. Taylor swift. So when they were dating or they were friends, I know you're super famous and now he's funny. He's an outing. Elaborated. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:50:37       I mean imagine that. Imagine that she's in that sick also. It's such like an undignified thing for someone like Taylor swift. All right. Now curl up and getting the suitcase. I wonder if it's like, well, pad it. If it's nice and cool. I was wondering. That's what I like or know of it. Or is it even like form cut to her. You know what I mean? Like it's a little like fetal position. Taylor swift slot that she just doesn't have that much space in there. Taylor swift being transported in a huge suitcase from our tribeca apartment in to her truck fleet of cars, including two large cadillacs and three suv is arrived at Taylor's apartment, Tribeca to move a large suitcase from her apartment.

Speaker 4:          01:51:13       Also dozens of Taylor swift security guys were present to move this package carefully as Taylor swift remains to be unseen for a long time. Now I went and there's a bunch of other photos of this suitcase

Speaker 5:          01:51:26       and for the audio listeners, stay understand this suitcase is not that bad at all. Well, you would have to be smaller than a person for sure. She definitely laid

Speaker 4:          01:51:35       barone all crunched up in a ball cannon ball into a swimming pool. So

Speaker 5:          01:51:42       here some detectives have a little bigger than a regular suitcase. I feel like. Well, it looks like a mute for use for musical. That's what it looks like. You can see here.

Speaker 4:          01:51:53       I mean if anything, this is kind of a testament to help FDIC. This Papa Razzi imagine you're willing to do crawl into a fricken suitcase to have. Well, do you know what she's doing? She probably wants to go do something private. Maybe she wants to fly somewhere, go to a beach without everyone knowing what she's doing all the time every day. So if like I get it. If you're trying to go hang out with all these filters like filming you and recording you, it's like, you know, you got to do what you can.

Speaker 5:          01:52:24       I always see videos of Justin Bieber and the proprietor people driving him crazy. Yeah, they're pretty aggressive with Justin. I've seen that shit too. It gives them shipped back though. I like watching those, but there's a lot of videos where he's nice at first and they really push it and then they start asking him really inappropriate getting in his way so he can drive away.

Speaker 10:         01:52:47       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:52:49       Yeah, man. Fame on that level is really. It's so. It's so cheap. People need to appreciate how challenging and

Speaker 5:          01:52:59       I mean those aspects for sure. People are paid to try and piss you off literally, like they're just there to piss you off, so you flip out and then it's a story story, right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:53:08       Just imagine that everywhere you go in public, people are paid to Piss you off and record it. Yeah. I mean, so I hope that people have a more of appreciation for what ultra famous people go through on a day to day basis is that it's not all just because there's. I always hear this kind of sentiment of like, Oh, you have no right to complain once I tell that to somebody that crawls into side a suitcase.

Speaker 5:          01:53:31       I mean obviously the riches and the fame that, that's nice and I'm sure they enjoy that, but you're right, it comes with baggage. Comes with some serious bag,

Speaker 4:          01:53:41       a lot, a lot money doesn't buy you happiness, I guarantee and promise you that buys you a one way ticket in a freaking suitcase in this case. Um, I thought that was wild. I was frankly shocked by that. What else? Uh, what else we got? What they forgot. What else do we got? People showing an explosion. Ian, do you have anything to say about this Kanye Ego? Like of the dance group? You want to come in here and watch it with us? He's like chickens. I please know really does not much to watch. I in, in here like Ben and he's nice. He's sweet, he's a great guy. He's got a good presence, you know, but if you don't want to, I won't force you. I may not understand that. Uh, you have a choice. I'm not going to podcast rape you, but you are fired if you don't come. Yeah. Let's, uh, let me find it. There's a new meme now about, uh, what else? Me saying what else there is. Yep. Used to be fascinating. Now it's what else? That's funny. It's been a long, long pot. Okay. Where is it? I got a whole list of things here. What else do you see it in this document that I'm looking at it right now. You can do. Highlight it for me. Why don't I see it? There it is.

Speaker 10:         01:55:17       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:55:20       Kanye has gone on stage, dressed as the joker. A, correct me if I'm wrong. Not intentionally. It looks like the joker. I hate to say this and I don't want to offend anybody, but he kind of looks like the guy that. I hate to say this. So don't say you shouldn't. The hair and the joker is reminiscent of, okay, I'm not the guy that shot up the theater on the Batman. It's not saying yes shooter, just saying it looks like the guy. Is that awful to say? I mean, it's just the orange hair. Right? Right. So

Speaker 7:          01:56:01       yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:56:10       he looks like he's doing the elaine dance kind of thing.

Speaker 4:          01:56:18       How people have speculated that he's on drugs. Is that substantiate or you think he's just having fun? I think once the power of that music just takes over your soul. You can't do much, but just let it possess you. Like that's the drug. The beauty of his music. Thank you. He very much reminds me of in though then a little bit of a goober just in general, like fun. What am I talking about? Why maybe you such an asshole. He's having a good time, man. He is letting it go. Dance like nobody's watching. That's what they say. They going to judge the guy. We're having a good ass time. Why? People got to say it looks like the shooters shot up Batman Theater. Who's saying that? Ignorant.

Speaker 9:          01:57:01       He's having a great time. Yeah. I wish I could go out and dance like that. Get it.

Speaker 4:          01:57:07       I heard that people were really happy with his performance. Actually

Speaker 7:          01:57:11       having a good time. Dude.

Speaker 4:          01:57:13       Look at me being a.

Speaker 7:          01:57:17       let's see what they think.

Speaker 4:          01:57:19       Somebody aunt, whatever. I don't need to re imagine reading reddit comments on live on a podcast. Well, it's been two hours less. The wedding dress is very short, so let's wrap it up here. Texas woman declares a tech was woman's celebrates or divorced by blowing up her wedding dress. Well, I can see that. That was a healthy relationship,

Speaker 7:          01:57:51       man.

Speaker 4:          01:57:52       What the hell did that guy do to you? There's like a whole party here to celebrate.

Speaker 7:          01:58:03       Why?

Speaker 9:          01:58:05       Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          01:58:16       That was a lot more than I expected. Just be like a little mad or something. That's a real explosion. What that guy did to her man, but whew, that's a good. It's a good thing. You guys got divorced.

Speaker 7:          01:58:32       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:58:35       Alright guys. We're thinking of doing an extra episode on Tuesday now. Me, a fan of the Howard

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       stern show, they have this segment called cleaning out the computer, which is all the segments and all this stuff they had planned that they never got time to do on the show. Thinking of setting up a panel here with Ian and Dan to join us and to go over all the great things of the year that we never had time to get to do an extra episode on Tuesday. Let me know what you guys think about that idea. Not that, uh,
