Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Welcome up. My Dude's, my doggies and Micah z boys to the Gazebo only zone. I am your host, Ethan Klein. I am sick as a dog. This is my beautiful pregnant wife who I love and adore. She's the angel of my life and the light of my life. She's everything that I've ever hoped to find in a partner. And so much more. We look like I am so sick. I'm delirious. I'm out of it. You know, you're still embarrassed by my introduction, I say, but it's true. It's all true and so much more. I am so sick. I am completely out of it. I've been pumped with all the quills that they quills the night quells the a twilight quills. What do you get when you combine NYQUIL and dayquil? I'm in the twilight well right now and um, started wiccan coil. Oh hell yeah. After today I'm going to be weekend quilt out.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       Oh, and thank you to our sponsors, Audubon, Mandy's, linkedin. Almost forgot about those great dudes. Um, I am so out of it. So this is going to be a roller coaster ride. Guys. Thank you for joining us on this beautiful, blessed at Friday. Oh right. Don't we all love it so much. Yes. I'm happy to share this special day with you all. Um, we had Tom Segura and Christina P, two of my favorite people on the planet. We're scheduled with her on Wednesday. I was sick. Unfortunately. We're going to get him back on here soon, but I love those guys. Went to Disney yesterday with my family, which made my illness worse. So, um, but you know what, that's enough about what's going on in my life. Let's get to the science of why we're all here today, last week. And it's been part of the show mythology I would say is we have these twitter polls, which really illuminating, I would say some of the darker parts of our society.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       Not Dark and the sense of being, um, being unethical or something to be feared. But I'm on dark in the shadows, in the shadows in that it hasn't yet been uncovered or looked at. We are, we are great searchers. We just great discovers we are pranksters. Do like social experiments. This is real shit. I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't be surprised to see some of these twitter polls being quoted and such reputable articles as wikipedia. So we had one last week about do you smell on your hand and you fart on your hand and smell it. I'm so out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       Do you fart on your hand and smell it? So first we did. Do you like the smell of your own farts and most overwhelming, obviously. Yes. And there were some naysayers like I got kind of upset because I feel you're kidding, but you're saying that you're serious, but it's like you're kidding. Well, the Paul speaks for itself. So first of all, there was some disbelief that people liked the smell of their own farts. But then we took it a step further. We said, do you fart on your hand and smell it? And most of the people in here except for Zack is the only honest being here was like, what is wrong with you? They say, they say, Ethan, you are. You shouldn't exist. They say to me, so let's go to this pole because this was a prolific vote. I would say this was a paramount benchmark vault we took place here.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       Have you ever smart farted on your hand and smelled it? 124,000 votes. That is a huge number. And let me say 51%. Yes. And after this poll, I bet you it's going to go even higher. We even saw a capo on when we were at Disneyland and the guy had to tell me that he does it too. Yeah. And actually it was golf and I said, can I smell your hand? Lenny Snooze, I sniffed his hand. He had a Turkey leg in it and it was a fart in a curriculum. It was a great time. We had their Disneyland. Um, um, so there you have it guys. This is science. This is real science we're doing here on the podcast. Um, but then so I got an email from a fan podcasts@hdsreproductions.com and she blew my ass out with a new one she wanted to broach with us.

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       So let me read this email from autumn, autumn g Hello Ethan. And Ila lately on the show, you guys been talking about your gross habits and Isla almost every time has said she does not share these strange routines. So as it yield Kleiner I had met when I'm on my cycle I will often smell my blood. Nope. Sometimes I find it satisfying and sometimes I find it gross. Lately my blood has smelled similar to red wine and I've never smelled my blood when it's in a, oh she says, and I never smell my blood when it's in a Tampon. Well how does she smell it then? So I hate the smell and that is why I usually prefer to wear a tampon cause I like you don't smell it as much, but how does she smell it? You just from the toilet. If you wear like a pad?

Speaker 1:          00:05:27       Yeah. Oh then you take it off and it was kind of like a Wa it's like a strong odor. I hate it. What does it smell like? Gross. Like body odor or like blood? Both, I guess you like like stink. Whoa it, he has men. I think all the men listening to this are like, wow, we're not supposed to talk about it. It's like the ladies pack don't break the back. Girls don't poop. They don't fart and they don't have their periods. Did you all know that periods stink? Fuck man. What did you think? I never thought about odor being involved can, I don't know, maybe I'm not describing it right but I find a girl. It sounds like you're right. I mean she says herself, she sniffs her period. Blood sometimes satisfying some. Do you ever find it satisfying? I always grows sometimes more gross than other times if I smell it more. But you think it's all equally gross cause she's saying sometimes it has extra stake. I guess that's possible. A fraud like it smelled like red wine. Does it have anything to do with the volume of blood that's in it? Probably. And does it have anything to do with the wounds? The last time you changed your Tampon? Like if how much body odor and sweat gets mixed in.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       I Dunno, the fascinating stuff. It's like, wow, this is new. So you're saying that it uniformly always smells bad and you even go so far as to wear tampons to avoid smelling it all together. Yes. So what I want to pose to our female listeners today is, um, do you ever smell your period blood? So we are going to make a twitter poll. Dan, you've got the bigger yup. For ladies only head on over to h podcasts on twitter. If you're a lady and cast your vote, do you ever smell your period blood? Now these are fully anonymous vote, so you don't have to worry about being out at or being discovered or anyone knowing about your disgusting habits, which we all have. So not to worry, but I am truly fascinated by this period. Blood smell. It's a new concept. It's a paradigm shift in my understanding of periods.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       How was the early voting? I'm very curious. So my initial refresh, 53 votes, and it's about 50 50. It's 49 51 right now. Whoa. I had a feeling it would be like a vote. We're going to take going to be 50 50. Was there ever, no. Yeah, of course. No, there's been huge swings. There's been huge swings. We've had 70 thirties and yeah. Yeah. We had a 60 40 with the front and wiping the fiasco. Remember? No, that's what I thought it would be. I think it would be. I expected that because I, if I'm a woman and I have stinky periods, I'm smelling it cause I'm already saying I smell my farts. I'd be sounds climbing in that that 50 50 ratio is holding. It's holding steady. I would think that I would be smelling my period blood it. Thanks. So yeah, I would, because I scratched my balls and smelling the hint.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       I think they just be smelling it. I think there's just two types of people in the world. I think so. Probably the people like or in denial me. Yeah, you're in. I do think that's true because it sounds like I don't want it to return true because it sounds like you do smell your period blood. You're aware of the smell. I hate it. I know, but you what ads on some level you still do smell and assess it and make some analysis of it. The fact is that you're in denial and you don't embrace it as something you know that you can get into on a personal level. Right. I don't know. I'm happy that I got nine months right now. Period went out, but then it's almost like the baby is almost like the nine months of period, like stored up and it's just like, so it's like a break and then a burst.

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       Yeah. I'll be, oh, you think you got something good going on? Just the wave, but at least it has a happy end to periods. Don't necessarily have happy endings. Excepted the rover. I'll be right there with you. I haven't. I tell you, I have so much admiration. I have so much respect. You have to go through that and I'm not jealous of that at all. I'm truly appreciative that you need to do that because my god of myself. No, I know. I know. That's an idea thing. I mean denial about the that has to happen. Yeah, well it's really just something, it's like, oh, the baby's coming. Let's just do it. You just have to do it. You just have to do it, but you're going to get drug, then you're going to be smart about it and just not feeling thing because a lot of women are like, I'd want to do it natural.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       And then halfway through when they're in excruciating pain, they're like, hey man, they thing the band name. My sister is crazy. She, she was like no painkillers and she'll, she really didn't take anything throughout. Your sister's a superhuman. She's a freaking nature. But in your case, because the reason women don't get this because it could take longer, right? Yeah. The Painkiller Fred, that you, because you're a nom, you're won't push hard as much as your word if you're not. I prefer the painkiller from my perspective to not feel pain and have it take an extra five hours. Well, five hours. Well, I'm just saying that's an exaggerated comparison, but I think that you'll be, but I agree with you. You know what I'm saying? You don't want to trust me. Trust me. A guy that knows nothing about it. I have a friend who was like, I don't want it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:17       And then halfway through she decided she wanted it, but then it took long ago cause they didn't have it prepared for her. Oh Man. The whole time she was just like [inaudible] you get the painkiller. Is it like no pain, like total numbness? No, it's probably helped the law. It helps. But I don't think because when I, I had a, um, I don't know, I had a huge mole removed on my back as a kid. Um, I think I must've been 12 or 11, but, um, it was a really big surgery where they cut it out. And um, when they gave me numbing shots and it was extremely, extremely painful, it was so painful. These shots, oh, was price cause it was just a shot. I think this one is also painful, but I felt nothing like zero sensation and I was awake. But I time, I think you're already in so much pain from the, uh, what do you call it?

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       Contraptions. Oh, the contraptions. Yeah. So I think that pain of that shot is like tracking competitor actions. So I think, I think they have amazing medicines that I think will really minimize the pain you experience. But the thing is like when I had the surgery on my back, so I felt no pain at all. But then when they finished they had to sew me up and the doctor had to cat co, what do you call that when you electrocuted? Catterick colorize cauterize. He had to cauterize my flesh together. So he basically, he literally like burned my flesh together and that was fucking, it wasn't paid. I couldn't feel the pain, but it felt so weird cause I was being electrocuted. How'd that smell? That's crazy. I didn't smell flesh. I just found it was just a wild sensation dude. But um, yeah, so there's a couple of people who responded.

Speaker 1:          00:13:07       I do and I secretly think it smells okay. Yeah, there you go. Exactly. I don't think exactly. I think this is a very interesting and healthy discussion guys. This moment. It's actually exactly 50 50 and then there's, I'm not sure what to choose, but you can't avoid smelling it, but it's still gross. So there you go. I think there really are two types of people in the world, you know, and I think that was exactly 50. I think that's what it boils down to. You know, people who are in denial as you said, dance and people that are like, I'm onboard with spelling my period and my, I bet you the same people that smell their fear period blood. So I'll still smelling their farts and they'd probably pitched their vagina and smell their hand probably, you know. Um, all right, well fascinating stuff here guys.

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       This is a science explanation, but if science experience full beginning fascinating. Yeah, I love it. Um, what else we got here? Oh, another fence submission. This was the best fricking video I've seen in such a long time. You guys, Oh my God. Talk about Tlc. We've been talking about Tlc a lot. I haven't seen this yet. So I'm, so this comes from discovery o. And. M. It's a [inaudible] editor. Yeah. Yeah. I know. They're like, hang on guys, we've got to stop, make, wait, planet earth, none of that. I'll fucking cancel that. We're working on a new show called diagnose this or diagnosed me and we're going to do epic reenactments of these, of these diseases. Now this guy, Ron, suffers from ceaseless belching and co he's, he cannot stop burping. He cannot stop burping and they reenact it and oh my God, this is from devin mirrors. So God bless. [inaudible] this is the best thing I've seen. It's incredibly healing

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       before his condition began. It's kind of scratchy it up. Yeah. Here. Uh, I think I might know what's up. Hold on one sec. We're all set up here. Very Professional. Always prepared and very alive. That's right. Folks. How are you feeling? You feeling pregnant? I feel really tired and I think that's part of this stage. How was Disney for you yesterday as a pregnant lady? I could, I go on all the fun rides. So I thought, what are already like a boring mom. I felt so bad for you as I wrote all the awesome rides and I was tired because he fixed it. Yeah, I'm already lame yet. And you're not lame. It's not your fault. You're amazing. You have a fucking, you're growing a human body and your stomach. That's as amazing as it gets. Pretty cool. Yeah. You know, laying your fricking awesome. All right, here we go.

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       It's wife sue. Have a good day recently.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       That's love baby

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       or stress. Just working on growing my business. I look at this, this is the reenactment that gives you any more. That was like, what am I watching?

Speaker 1:          00:16:35       Hello? So the burping sound is insane. It's always like, uh, and um, but I soon learned is that the burping soundbite they use is a sound bite from the actual guy. It is. So he's actually, so what they're doing is playing the actual birth, but the guy every time they say that, no, you could tell because they show one brief clip of actual guy burping. And so they use that one soundbite and they use it every time in this reenactment. And it sounds, it's the same stuff. Oh my God, it's amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:17:12       I'm sorry ma'am. It started gradually

Speaker 1:          00:17:16       and he's so like, it's like you just burp I, and he's always like, I'm so sorry ma'am. But yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:17:29       I would be, I'm looking trolling, you know when I was at the customer's house and then when I went outside and real dump trunk, I've just belching belching balls. You got the brushed her off

Speaker 3:          00:17:43       three.

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       It seemed crazy. Ron's no, sorry. I can't help it. I balls for maybe 2030 minutes an hour and then start up again.

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       Why do you have to Burp so loud? Just close your mouth. Well, you don't have to Burp loud. I don't think he can control it. Does this show about it? I don't think it can control it. Lee. He's burping a lot, but I mean you could control how loud you burp. You can go or you can be like, not always. Really. I've never heard you burp. What do you know about it? I see people burp, but you burp quietly, right? Because you're a lady. I don't remember. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:18:42       thanks. One of us should sleep. At least one of us should sleep, can be part of society. Sat Up. He literally said he wakes his neighbors, address a series of tests. His doctor had a bowel obstruction and suggest it's all in Ron's head. Stop thinking about it so much. What are you supposed to do? Like Dang gone has been belching nonstop for months cause that's

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       suburb. I've never heard a burp like that in my life and so yeah, it has to be there using that soundbite,

Speaker 2:          00:19:36       going to dozens of doctors, the one cure that's out working. Look at that face. Look at this reaction that seemed to work. Just stopped working with a vengeance. Leaving Ron. So desperate he wants to kill himself

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       there you got, he wants to kill him. Well he, yeah, I know. I feel bad for the guy, but like they do this sound editing where they'll take the soundbite burp like here and then they'll like damp in it. So it seems like he's far away, but they're just using the same soundbite

Speaker 2:          00:20:12       Ron. So desperate. He wants to kill himself dry. How thing? No, they're making them

Speaker 1:          00:20:22       like, yeah, like he's turning into a wall, like a Stephen King novel. But yeah, he's like a werewolf.

Speaker 2:          00:20:33       What is happening?

Speaker 1:          00:20:37       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       finds out what's going on. She panics and calls nine one one emergency room. They looked over my records. They said there's nothing we can do for you. We're going to, Scott is assigned to mental health counselor Lisa Gustin. Right. Rick questions open up the reservoir of pent up.

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       Although he does this factor when he birthed, I didn't see the guy do that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:07       He just fit every criteria for anxiety and depression. He fitted

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       why way. It turns out he needed an antidepressant. Really and he wasn't manifesting anxiety and unusual way and that he's cared now for. I believe it. You do what's on discovery. You can't be wrong. They wouldn't lie to us hitting me with that sound bite. That's the BURP. The first time I started, I wish I could wash the first time with you guys cause the first time I saw this I was just crying. I hard. That's all so good. So fun.

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       Look at that diagnosis Ron. On the general lines, they worry, they edit it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       He does this look like perfect like a thousand times a day and he's surprised every time it happens. Adidas sorta combined with clinical depression. I of those things where I'll burp. I guess I got out of the problems. It stimulates the brain in a certain area. I love that. That video is fricking Jim. I did. Oh, shout out. Wow. Having a lot of fun here. That's a great suggestion. Um, damn. What's the pool at? Uh, let's take a look. We've got refreshing a 49 51 man. This, this truly is the nature of what this is going down. You actually the yeses slightly down, but I mean it's (485) 024-0850 two no. Oh, so no is slightly edging. So that makes it feel more realistic. Um, I feel like the margin of error though, like you got to say it that that's it. That's a split. Well, the pro, the problem is that you have to vote to see the results.

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       And so a lot of dudes out there one, is that right? What I see the results. It says ladies only. So I know any dudes are voting. There's got it. I wish there was a way to view the results and about, it's so messed up because you know what you we to add a third option that says I'm a dude. Oh then it doesn't affect the fricking, you know what should we do? Another one do a new one. A race that one dan and start over with a third option. I'm a dude. No vote and thank you. All right. I've been trying to say for many years and I'm a brilliant mind to listen to me more. Cause there is a couple of guys here including and from a smudge. What did he well they sat, I'm a guy so this is sexist. Oh well you smell your period bug in.

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       You Smell Pam's period blood. Yolande it's not your period blood. I don't want to like I want to, I'm kidding. I don't know anymore. You all smell it. You see, I don't know if she tried to be your own excrement. I mean you've got a cookie live. I'm so out of your got a cookie. Just straight on the table. Like we have plates unfold at the tweets, the tweets back up. Anybody that already voted you gotta go back to you're obligated. You should leave a comment and explain why we re posted it. I'm like, okay. I don't go fuck. It's just a fucking sick and I don't give a shit. That was Scott. Ian brought cookies. I'm like [inaudible]. Every time I see doughnuts or cookies or something on the table, I'm like, who the fuck brought these? I get angry as I eat them because I'm like, I don't need this shit. And it's always Ian. He was trying to feed me. Oh, it is always the end. I know he's a feeder and I yelled at him every time I say, don't bring this shit here is I eat three of them.

Speaker 1:          00:25:00       Okay, we got to go to a break or should we move on to the Youtube? Okay, great. System is broken pretty early for break. How much time? I think Youtube, uh, worth 24 minutes. Okay. You want to know about the new Paul? Yeah. What is it? Is it a big difference? Well, I'm a dude is winning a lot. Well that's not good. But if you're removed that we have yes. 28 yes, that's true. And No, 24 oh this is, this is so important. This is such an important social experiments or flat valid, fundamentally flawed. Well, no, not all of them. Just gender specific ones, which is like all of them not far on your hand and spell it. That's the big one. Hello. Trying to throw out my science. I think it's the only guy in my head. Can I get another cookie? Those are incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:25:50       Um, okay. I got something to complain about here. Everyone who likes to hear me complain about Youtube. This is just a fun little anecdote. So I got a claim. Oh, you actually brought me a cookie. I didn't need that to let you know that your mom delivered all of her babies naturally. Oh yeah. So I don't know if you could hear that Ethan's mom delivered all of her babies naturally, but I think that was just the time back then, isn't it? I feel like my mom did too. Or like my mom would have a lot to say about this chicken call. It gives me more time to eat cookies. I'm just trying to buy time to eat more cookies. These are sane. Ian. What the Fuck's wrong too? Um, all right theresa, let me focus it. Got this off. This is the worst episode we've ever done. Good ball gets to everybody. Um, so loud. Okay, sorry. Sorry. Sorry everybody. Sorry. All right, here. I'm going to complain about Youtube. Okay. Yay. We're coming here for papa. John, mute me. Okay. This is a highlight claimed by whoever these cocksuckers are for a song, sex on fire. Okay. Here's the interesting little fact. We didn't use that song. It's not even in the clip. So I file a dispute and there's not even an option for this. Whatever you claimed isn't even in my video.

Speaker 3:          00:27:26       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       there's not even an option of like fuck off. Right? So anyway, I, I what? I don't remember what I did. I think I did like, I think you just doing like, it's fair. Use My, my use. Is there something I didn't know you didn't use it? I don't know what I did, but how would that even get in there? Well, I didn't know what I did, but I just basically said in the scripture, this song did not appear in the video. So release your claim. And so here's the best part. These are these huge media companies. Just go on rampages of claiming videos because there's no, um, there's no recourse, there's no accountability. They get free money and they have no reason not to claim every single video. I waiting for one of these guys who just claim every single video on youtube. They're like, fuck yeah, no, you use sex on fire. The way the law's written there, there's no recourse or well technically or a false claim that it's so broad. It says, um, and good faith. So you could, I think that a claim like this for something that's not even in the video is an end good faith. But you're, you're bringing a lawsuit, I guess the company for something. So, you know, it's just,

Speaker 1:          00:28:56       and there's no damages. It's like, it's pointless. What do you, what do you know what I'm saying? You would need to have like a huge class action lawsuit to show like tons of damage over like thousands of users. It would be so complicated to actually litigate that. So expensive and complicated to litigate that and they know it. And as far as I'm aware, they've never been held, recount accountable for this shit. Here's the options. Um, these are all these except for fair use I think or well, most of them except for farriers are just like youtube way of being like, see you later, idiot. Here's what you get when you try to dispute it. I own the CD that's youtube being like, see Ya.

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       I think if you click that they're, you don't have a reason. You don't know what you're talking about. Yeah. I'm not selling the video or making any money. That's a skip. I gave credit in the video. That's his cup videos, my original content. I own all the rights to it. So that one's fine. Um, I have a license or permission. That one's fine. Meets Fair use. That one's fine. Content is public domain. So those ones are all fine. Actually find claims to make. So I don't remember which one I did, but their response is what's really makes this a powerful. Um, they responded by, I disputed it and they responded by rejecting my dispute.

Speaker 4:          00:30:20       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:30:24       who is they? And this huge media companies, I don't know. Youtube, not youtube, these media company, I don't know what spa and there's like seven of them. So I said, hey, this isn't your songs. And even in the video, that's the first level. You dispute that. And then they come back, they rejected my dispute and they said, ah, I don't fucking care. I'm keeping it sex on fire.

Speaker 1:          00:30:50       That's the worst thing is that they accused us of using kings of Leon. I didn't even know what that was. Pop sign. Never. It's like, what? So I'm like, okay, that's insane. Um, the fact that they would dispute it. So now I am forced to go one step further in the process. And at this point you basically say your songs aren't in the video, leave me alone. And they have the option to strike and remove the video. So there's something wrong with youtube though because three of our last three videos have been claimed, like the frequency of claiming videos and just erroneous and shameless claims have sky. I mean three of our last view. And it's still a bunch of new companies that have like a whole division that is just this. I think that it has new claiming stuff. I think they have tools because you cannot go watch videos. They have some kind of automated tools that match it. And this case it's wrong. And they don't even put in the effort to reviewing it. I mean, youtube has got to regulate these people because they're running a muck right now. It has not been this bad ever, I don't think. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       and then just to show you guys where, where's the video of all of our demonetize monetize videos? Uh, Dan in the PDF. I don't see the pbl. I opened a tab of it. You should stop reading. Oh my God. It's not tab and you're on the desktop. Here it is again. That does not work. It doesn't work then. All right, forget about it. You gotta put on my desktop next time. Um, so that's about it. I'll share this pick when we get back. This is the best episode we've ever time. This is the one that will be remembered for.

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       So, um, we will be back with that picture that you're promised. We've got a lot to talk about. Celebrity asm are a bunch of amazing videos. Elon musk is a weed and a call from Gb Acmr who has got some Churros that we've talked about. She's got choice words for me.

Instead, you need to find the person's can take your business to the next level and where do you find those people on linked in? That's right. As the world's largest professional network, people go to linkedin every fricking day to grow professionally and discovered job opportunities.

The skills interest in even how open they are to new opportunities. This way your job gets seen by more of the right people.

Welcome back everybody to the period blood smelling experience. The missing pdf I was trying to find for you guys. I just want to show you, youtube has been on a crazy on monetizing just out of nowhere. Your old Shit nigger. This tried to explain half of these prank invasion a closer look. These horrible designs are unreal. Crappy designs. Prank of agent starts world war three is Pewdie Pie. Racist toy channels are ruining society. Crazy feminists triggered by lyft driver. That's the title. So cringy crazy feminists gets triggered. Oh, that's so cringey to the different time, wasn't it? Featuring humongous dicks out for her. Rhombi which is like a kid. I mean I, it's like Kik. Give me a break. Is the monetized because it has an asterix?

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       I think because what we do is a face, no, it's the most wholesome Joey Salads, the deleted social experiment, prank invasion, the dangers of social media. Girl virtually assaulted in GTA. See Israel of Loc. It's a Vlog baby. Love your body. Alison gold, Dj Khaled. [inaudible] kissing pranks. The original dg Kalb celebrates hold you down. Alison gold, ABCD, fg. Um, and so many more. It's just older and stuff. But like these are a lot of our main big videos that people aren't videos. That's the total at the top. Yeah, 71. I mean a lot of them are old. Probably like 20 or 30 of them are. But these, these are our cream of the crop. These are our money earners cause they still give used over it. That's a big one. A lot of the old ones are unlisted. Okay. But the ones I'm showing you are our big earners.

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       Those are really, and some of our most viewed videos. So yeah. And the, they don't tell you they just like just a day ago I saw just randomly in my email like five new videos, like of our biggest ones, like not suitable. It's like, okay, that's weird. Why? Yeah, why, who cares? So shout out to youtube and to the copyright system for helping to encourage creators and to be a very encouraging environment. Now since we created this, do you smell your period blood pole and added option for? I'm a dude. The results have swung quite a bit. Yes. Because I can see a lot of dudes just being like, no, that's gross. Let me see the results. But the majority is giving us yes in this, um, in this scenario here, how do you feel about that? Hello? I'm surprised by it after doing this podcast. Not surprised. Not surprised. All right. Where were we? Um, Yada, Yada Yada.

Speaker 1:          00:42:38       We've got the mail bombers car we got to chose, chases criminal down. Let me get a Acmr. Let me do this same more segment cause we got gb standing by to give us her opinion. I came across this celebrity Asm, Amr playlists, who, who put this together. It was like a, a huge magazine. Um, oh, it's a w magazine. W I ever heard what the hell, what did they do? What does any magazine do? 20th right? Making youtube videos, trying to make a viral videos so they have celebrities do eighth or, but I don't really, they have a lot, by the way. Carra de, I don't know how to say her name. You guys don't know who she is and they'll, Dell Levine a gal, good dot. Aubrey plaza, Kate Hudson, Ashley Graham, Emily Radic, Koski Cardi B and so many more. Some hike. They're all females by the way, which kind of supports my theory for Jake Gyllenhaal as one guy, but otherwise it's all females. Supports my theory that GB is going to try to dispute, which is fine. Gb, um, that this is largely used by men that liked this virtual companionship of females. And I feel like especially the one with Cardi B, when you show it, I'll show that. But first I want to show up what most of them. This is actually the most viewed one by Cora. That's 5 million views and I don't think they will. It's, she's just whispering. Um, really me so weird. Westbury. She just, you know, it's actually really bad for your throat.

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       Fun fact number one.

Speaker 4:          00:44:40       Um, I dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       I'm Kyra telephone, which is just worth a frame. I don't know what she has to mix. Why does she keep switching mikes? It's not really, it's tomorrow. That's a big part of it is because they're pan hard left and right. And so like us in the back right now with the headphones were hearing her in one year and then the other year and I think that's like, that's part of it. Yeah. But I think you're supposed to do like use it as for the like, but she's no expert. We have an expert on the line. Yes. I played too. At any rate, it's niche. It's just, it's just a celebrity whispering, you know? Yeah. Like Cardi B on the other hand does give it a fair shake. I'm actually impressed she got through it. Yeah. Look at this dude. My Dick is straight up at full half math right now. I wonder if she smells or period blood. She probably does already be. Probably next time you're approaching a girl that you're interested in, you're like, gosh, she's amazing. She's so out of my league. I can't even talk to her. Just remember, most likely she smells her period. Blood life dude. Yeah, Dude. Just remember she's human. She's snips your period blood.

Speaker 1:          00:46:04       I'm getting tinkled I like the hand gestures. She's got her hand out on a client like scratching my back or something virtually. Right. Did she sell intuit? Oh yeah. Fucking a stroke. It, it's kind of weird with the Mike's and Oh, she's dual welding. She's fucking, Oh God. She's taken both of them at once. I saw it and I was like, what the fuck dude? I'm tingling and all the right places, but she is actually doing good. I feel like she is, but I want to know what you think so, but yeah, so I think we've properly set it up. So let's get the expert on the line. Gba, Smr, um, is with us here today. Gb, how are Ya? God bless you. Thanks for joining us. Hey, nice to meet you. Thanks for joining us here today as our resident, a smart expert. Now your channel is quite big and it is very popular. You're very good at what you do apparently, and so thank you. First of all, I have to ask you, do you smell your period blood? Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       we were just talking about that in the room because we were watching the beginning of the podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:47:34       Yeah. Okay. I'm glad you have a preference to that. That would have come off really weird. He didn't know what I was talking about.

Speaker 5:          00:47:43       We were saying that like that's the, that's the consensus is you don't really have a choice.

Speaker 1:          00:47:47       Right, but the question really, well, okay, let's, we don't need, we have who don't need to dive too deep, but you didn't you, you smell it against your will. Seems to be your answer so you can finally grows. No wait. She said no, she doesn't know gross.

Speaker 5:          00:48:07       No, it's not pleasant. I would not. I would not smell it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:10       Okay, excellent. Great. I'm glad we got to the bottom of that. Now, what did you think about these celebrity? I'm a cmr segments that I just shared. If you're watching those.

Speaker 5:          00:48:22       Yeah, I've actually seen those. So the W it's, it's, it's a women's magazine. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:48:26       Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:48:32       it's actually really cool to see celebrities doing asmr because, you know, just a couple of years ago, it's something that no one was talking about or I had heard I've heard of, like I've been watching it for like eight years on Youtube and since I know my channel is all like two years old, but I've been watching it forever and like I was always embarrassed to talk about it because when you come in on it at first, so like this, this is kind of weird, like objectively. Hmm. Um, but when you see people like Cardi b like doing asr, less weird, so they're sort of making it more normal.

Speaker 1:          00:49:06       And so what is it that I got wrong or what did I miss and my original segment about asm, our videos? Because to me, I think people I've previously spoken that it does seem to be like the popular Acmr channels are ones of cute, you know, cute young girls, not, not young, not young, young ladies, practice two attractive young ladies. And um, it seems, uh, you know, as a guy it's a nice kind of way to get a companionship and relaxed and you have kind of a wave spending time, intimate time with a girl. Do you contradict that?

Speaker 5:          00:49:45       I don't think you're wrong. I don't think that's everything though. Okay. Um, I think most like most people who have never seen it before, they jump in on it and they're like, oh, this must be a sex day. Hmm. Um, and while you can absolutely find asmr videos of sexual overtones, you can find sexual anything. You know, people will always utilize that to get views or you know, to gain popularity quickly. Or maybe it's just how they like to do it. Um, but I have some art itself. Like I keep asking people like, over and over again, I'm like, so why do you watch it? Why do you watch it? I'm just like the overwhelming response. It's just people need to be stressed, you know? Like they need to relax and it's free and it's accessible. Hmm. Um, and more people enjoy Asmr like, like nightly, like they just want to sleep, I think. Um, but I have heard, and I'm even myself, like I've used the smr when you feel like lonely and you just want somebody talking for a while on a video. But I mean, you could do that with any youtube video.

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       Yeah. But there's this kind of the whispering, you know, this, there's a sense of intimacy and like the ticking it tough. You know, it's, it's, it's, you know, you know what, so what does a popular misconception about asm or that people get wrong? He want to correct that. It's not just sexual,

Speaker 5:          00:51:07       you said, you said intimacy because it, I think that we can all agree that it is, it's intimate. Yes. Um, but I would say like, it's more intimate in the way that like, like when your mom like puts you to bed and she was like rubbing your back and singing you a song. If you wouldn't want a stranger do that to you, but it's not sexual. Um, and so I think like when somebody gets,

Speaker 1:          00:51:31       yeah, I think for a lot of guys it might be, I do like the idea, but I don't have a problem. Yeah, I agree that it's not only sexual though, but I know like with, and the intern it is like, no, I don't want to embarrass you too much about it, but uh, he is a fan of yours. He was just watching you the other day, right? Yeah. I'm honored in Jewish and he is too embarrassing on it. Monica. Well, um, let's move on then. He'll build up the courage as we could tell to talk. So how do you feel about this one would Cardi B it is very sexual acts are like, dude, she was folic, I dunno how to use given a double blow jobs as far as I can. That's an unfortunate microphone shape, but she was like,

Speaker 5:          00:52:26       she listens to asm are a lot. I'm like, we've, we've known that before. Like she's seated. Yeah. That's cool. How, because you can tell when somebody is actually seen it before and they get it. Like it's hard to explain why. Like I know she gets it, but she does.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       No, no, you can't love that. Um, do you know what your demographic between male and female on your analytics

Speaker 5:          00:52:52       [inaudible] 60% male, 40% female.

Speaker 1:          00:52:55       Interesting. Pretty good spread that it's skewed as you would think. Right. My Mail skews way more than that. Got like 85% male. People are watching your videos for you baby, you think? Um, do you ever get any creepy emails or tweets from guys that get, like, there's gotta be some guys that get like overly attached with you, right? Probably a fringe, I'm sure about. So what's the craziest Shit you've seen?

Speaker 5:          00:53:24       Okay. There have been a couple people where I had to like get police involved. Um, people are unable to sort of separate the distinction of like, I'm speaking to an audience and not to you specifically. Um, I know a lot of people have had that issue, not, it's a lot of like personalities and you know, people who talk to their audience and stuff like that. But, uh, I had this one person who sent me like tens of thousands of messages before I even saw it. Wow. Where did they sounding as if I was responding to him.

Speaker 1:          00:53:59       Oh my goodness. That must have freaked you out. That was very freaky. Where did what, what a platform where the message is sent on?

Speaker 5:          00:54:09       That's facebook messenger.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       Ooh. Hmm. Yeah. Like a friend. Like they were a facebook friend.

Speaker 5:          00:54:18       Well, I had a page for it, CBA tomorrow and people could just send messages to it, but I wouldn't get notified.

Speaker 1:          00:54:25       Um, wow. Hazards of the job. Now finally, I want to say again in, is a big fan of you. Um, he's, I mean, I don't know if you're familiar with, and he's a big important part of the show and it's really cool guy. We like him a lot. In, would you like to say anything to a GB? Harrison's? We've got her on the phone. I know you're a fan.

Speaker 4:          00:54:49       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       seriously. In when he was just up the good work. I can't hear you. We can't hear you. They hear you. Can everyone oh yeah, yeah, yeah. He's like keep up the great work and, and also, and also Ian was wondering if you're single. I'm not, I'm so sorry to burst that bubble. Sorry. Yeah. Well we appreciate you. We, uh, I appreciate, you know, ken on the phone and talking with us. Um, and yeah, bringing some clarity because it is interesting. It's wild. It's so, it's weird, like, like you acknowledged from the outside. It's, it's strange, but I have to tell you that I do when I put it on, you know, you do kind of, it is nice. It is nice. You know. Oh, I wanted to ask you, I was going to say, you said you liked it. Yeah, yeah, I do. Kind of like, yeah. And is there a, do you know if there was a, the opposite kind? People hate waste brine.

Speaker 4:          00:55:49       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:55:50       Yes. I think that's Microphonia. I think that's, you know, there's two types of people in the world because some people, you know, like you, you hear the sounds and you get like the tingling feeling and it's like, oh, this is really nice. Some people hear the sounds and they're like, I wanna die. Exactly. Like me. Yeah. The smell period. Blood or you don't, yeah. You know what I'm saying? Well, what do you, you know, I'm not that. I feel like I wanna die when I see our channel. Not at all, but my initial reaction will this trigger. Yeah. When I think of someone we spring is pleasant. Sure.

Speaker 1:          00:56:25       Um, I don't necessarily feel tingles, but I do feel kind of like a lightness and a pleasant sensation, you know? It's like extra relaxation. Yeah. It's nice. It is nice to hear though. You're going to do some, yeah. A Smr for me to can't, do you ever do a one like for your boyfriend? Would you ever do like a one person Acmr sesh? He doesn't get a Smr that was like super unfortunate. Oh, it's like beet red out here. Well, I feel like, um, that's kind of ironic I guess. And unfortunate that your boyfriend doesn't experience any, some more. I feel like that's going to expert for a girl could have been something there. Yeah, it could have been some great there, but it would be interesting to do like a one person Acmr show or like you could actually like, it's almost like a massage in a way. Like if you have like a, a a cmr therapy. Right. That's interesting. Why not? Yeah. I his growing it exists already. It exists, Huh?

Speaker 5:          00:57:27       Yeah. That was the smr spa that keeps popping up. There's some of that. And then some in New York it's called like a whisper lodge I think.

Speaker 1:          00:57:33       Whoa.

Speaker 5:          00:57:35       Yeah. Yeah. So people are really exploring with it now and experimenting and doing live shows and things like that.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       Do you think it will ever become mainstream or is it going to be something that's always hard to explain to people?

Speaker 4:          00:57:45       Cool.

Speaker 5:          00:57:47       If I compare it to a couple of years ago, like it is crazy mainstream now compared to, so I think it's really only going, I'm in because every time it sort of comes up in the media, we get more people in the community who are like, oh my God, wait, this is really relaxing.

Speaker 1:          00:58:02       Yeah. We've, we've even seen like Howard stern talk about it. Um, and all this celebrity doing it. It's like, yeah, as mainstream as he gets not. Yup. I wonder if there is anything you'd like Ai Mar that was so weird, but now I was like our seemed so weird but it's now fully accepted by everyone.

Speaker 4:          00:58:19       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:58:19       Right. A lot of people didn't get like twitch when I came out. Like gaming, like live straight. They're like, why would you want to watch somebody play video games?

Speaker 1:          00:58:27       Jimmy can make that joke. And we were like a really tiny like that. So all right. Just last night. Yeah. All right. Oh my God, that's so weird. We have got G, B, a, s, m, a R, G, I b. I a s Smr. Check her out. She is the best in the game. Um, I've listened. It's, I get, I feel it's nice. It's relaxing. He is a huge, huge fan and, um, we wish you all the very best. Yeah. And uh, thank you by the blessing weekend as well too. So thank you for God. Thank you. You too. Thank you. All right. Take care. Appreciate you. All right. Bye. All right. That was g, b a s m. R. And so we learned a lot from GB dentally. Yeah. It was interesting that she acknowledged that it is because I thought she was refuting that it's like it is not sexual or not sexual, but like intimate or a lot like a lot of guys are like, like the intimacy, not sexual, but like intimate. But she did acknowledge that it's that and it's more, which I think I agree, but, um, she's a professional, you know. Yeah. So there you go. There you have it. Gb a smr. All right. Ian, how was that for you?

Speaker 1:          00:59:52       Yeah, like his parents. That was incredible. Can't I can't hear him through the speaker. Oh, there you go. Yeah, that was incredibly embarrassing. And I was trying to talk, it wasn't working. That didn't help. But you do find her attractive right in? I think she's very talented or what she does great. Such a diplomat. He didn't like it's okay though. But she does have a boyfriend, Ian. So we do a lot to you guys for that. Take it easy. Um, she's cool. Yeah, moving on. It makes me wish that I enjoyed it. I feel like I'm missing out. Have you tried though? You know, I just know that I don't like, cause I actually, I gave it like a good shot for five or 10 minutes and I was very pleasant. It was nice. And then cause like I was watching like a cute girl and I was like, okay, I'm going to find a dude and I, and there's this one, I showed it like a gnarly bearded dude and he's like insane.

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       Like he's all over the place and that guy is like a king. So I wanted to be like, all right, it's not about that. But yeah, that guy was, was just as good. But also you're not really supposed to watch it. You're supposed to just listen. Right. Put it in the background. Yeah. Let's be frank. Being cute helps you in any field. That's true. If I was more handsome, you think that I wouldn't have 20 million subscribers if I wasn't more handsome. You think that pure that I wouldn't have more subscribers and cutie pie. He's handsome. That's why he has 60 million. All right. I mean, well, it's well known, Mike. When actors the attractive, they say it. The first rule of dating, be attractive. Second rule of dating. Don't be unattractive. Third rule, ask them if they smile on their period. Third Rural, sniff the period blood, the sniff test as it's called.

Speaker 1:          01:01:56       Why wasn't there a Seinfeld about period blood? Ah, you're slipping actually. Well, the differences about the same. Eight, 10% yes. 14% no. Yeah, six to 8%. I'm into it. I love it. I love that additional amazing. I love it. Um, all right. Moving on. Elon musk is that we've, this is an incredible story that needs to be shared with the world. He was banned recently for two from twitter because he was shit posting so hard that twitter was sure he was hacked, is security was compromised and they said there's no way. These are genuine tweets. We need to shut this down. They were real quick. So let's see, what was it that got him banned? He first begins with Iheart anime. 450,000 likes. I own H G v Wolverine now, by the way, did you feel about it? Cause you're, you have any man and you're a fan of everyone. I love anime. So do you love him in a more, even more than Whoa. He's just shit posting. I do. I do like him less and I don't like him less. I just think, I just don't know what, what's with the tweeting. I just don't really get him like, like he's

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       so I guess I just don't why he's trying to be like an edge Lord. All of a sudden it's like a midlife crisis. Maybe. It's like, dude, you're the coolest fucking greatest dude ever. You don't need to ship post on it. And I have to try. Yeah. You don't need to try. I mean, it doesn't make me like, I think it's funny. I think. I think that, um, I like him just as much as I ever did. I love Elon Musk. Um, I support him and his company's 100% and I as well. I just don't know what, you know, it's just a little unnecessary maybe. But yeah. And then he tweets his favorite anime. Love your name. I haven't actually seen this one, but apparently it's like a drama. I don't really like, um, who's best. I don't really like anime dramas. I like to see that.

Speaker 4:          01:04:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:10       I like, like action enemies because for me it's, I like the fantasy aspect. I like the magic. I'm making the power. That's what I need to watch. A drama. Anime. I can watch drama in any form. Cartoons. It's not real. That's why you get sick ass fucking magical powers because you can't actually do that in real life. Skip. Um, so acts that one elon calls himself Ilan Chan. Elan musk is a weep and he re re ponds. Ahem. Ilan Chan. What? I mean like where is he picking up this terminology? Just trolls read at all day. And I'm saying, well, like what form is he spending? Because the problem that, that makes me concerned is the people that talk with these kinds of means, people who like joke around like this are not the people that I want getting inside Elan Musk beautiful, pristine braid, right? Like I don't want him spending time on four Chan or Anamae subreddits.

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       That's maybe that's what it concerns me. It's more what it means. That what he's, why does he know all this stuff? Like you can what you can. I like anime, but I'm not, you're not. And it wouldn't be more fun for me by the way, that Elon Musk, we need his brain to be in good, clean, pristine, beautiful shape, not Ahem Ilan Chin. Like wherever he learned that I don't want him there and I'm not going to genesis even going. And that's amazing. And I'm not, what'd you say? I just notice that the meme that I don't know if he posted or somebody else below, but what? It's an elan below, you know, it's uh, uh, it was whatever you, I mean it's whatever. Okay, thank you Dan. Oh, this, I don't know that or the origins of this one. It's just a pawn off of a famous animator.

Speaker 1:          01:06:13       Um, so ian along continues. Hey, what's going on with two factor for Tesla Account, which is weird cause it's actually like a business related question though. It's not directed to the right place. So justifiably he says you want to buy some Bitcoin, which I think was probably when twitter was like, this shit's weird again on, I don't know where you, what's going on? What forms your browsing and we got to keep your brain beautiful. Noninfected and I'm not criticizing the people that do spend their times in that form. I'm just saying some people we need to protect you. Elon musk is one of those people, you know, I'm a cat girl. What is this shit keeps getting weirder every time I click here. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:06       Show us your bows at cos play. He says, actually I'm actually cat girl. Here's a selfie right now. Okay. Now your twitter right now, what's your call? Suspend or keep open. Exactly. I can see where they came from. Twitter ends up spending is suspending as account because he assumed he was hacked. And then finally we end on, um, send me your dankest memes. He tweeted what the fuck? And then pheidippides said meme review when he said midnight. I don't think that happened. Elon Musk. There you go. What a world. What a world we live in. You know what I'm saying? My God. But I will say on the, on the uh, on a beautiful positive note of Elan's Tesla, the be the most exciting progressive, um, risk taking future forward company that this world has seen in so long. Tesla, the automaker of electric cars has finally become, they're there.

Speaker 1:          01:08:20       They have blasted the expectation. Everyone was expecting them to lose those, those, those, those money, they were expected to lose 19 cents per share. Their quarterly earnings came in. It went up $2 and 90 cents per share. They made a profit for the first time ever. Smash expectations. Model three is become the best selling car in the United States. In terms of revenue and the fifth best selling car in terms of volume, the most revenue, best salad car in the United States. Unbelievable. The model three. These guys, I love Tesla, everything. You know what? I'm so happy that they're making it and they're making money and they're turning a profit. That's pretty amazing. I mean especially here in La, you see it everywhere now. Everywhere. Dude, brand new model three is everywhere. I have a lease on a s N it's open a year and I'm going to, I think I'm going to get a model three but I find it so amazing that as a company they released the model three with same features even better and for a lower price.

Speaker 1:          01:09:27       The thing is the model three, the performance version of the model three is way less than the model s that I have and it's faster, has a longer, any longer battery life. Which of the two things I care the most about? [inaudible] it's a little smaller, but I don't really give a fuck. Most people, but it's more modern. It's more futuristic. That's why it's going to be so huge. The model, the model three performance is like, the craziest version you can get is like $70,000. I know that's probably sounds like a lot to most of you, but comparable cars that go that speed could be like 10 times that price. Yeah. Yeah. Like a model three, it goes zero to 60 and like, um, like three seconds.

Speaker 1:          01:10:18       The closest thing of that is like crazy, like porsches and Maseratis and shit. You're looking at two or 300,000 plus hours, 70,000 bucks, and it's got like 320 miles per charge. But then it's just, it has so much more, and this is not a commercial. No, everyone knows that I am as long they don't need to pay anyone how far past everything else because the auto drive is so useful and then it's fully electric. But the real, the real thing, the real genius too is the infrastructure they've built. There's so many superchargers now that you can actually go on a long distance drive, which we've done many times and charge your car fast and reliably. Is that, is that the case outside of California? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Just anywhere you can drive across to, yeah. Huh. You can do a road trip. That is really impressive.

Speaker 1:          01:11:09       I mean that's the main, that's the main hurdle that everybody cross country for a long time we drove to vegas and they're adding more and more every, you know, all the time. But uh, yeah, lots of people drive cross country and their teslas now. It's wild. It's really cool. Um, so that's cool. And uh, and anyway, I will be sending my dankest memes to Elon Musk who congratulate him on his excellent performance. So, um, what else we got here? I got a lot of videos, but I'm so fricking owned. My throat is so fucked. I wasn't even a show how you were going to do this. I wasn't sure either because when we first started this I was like delirious. I was saying something to Isla. She's like, I don't even understand what you're telling me right now. And I was like, all right, well let's go live.

Speaker 1:          01:12:02       I hope you are comfortable talking today cause I can't, that it's true. It really happened. My throat really hurts. So I probably shouldn't talk that much because it's not going to help. Spending 14 hours at Disney yesterday was not helpful, but we were planning that trip for a year so I would be, God damn if I wasn't going. Um, let me see. I'll save this stuff for next week and hopefully maybe we could get tom and Christina next week. Oh yeah, that'll totally reschedule cause I saw some people worry. I hope we can do it next week because I have so many great videos I want to watch with them. Um, I've got questions but a lot of them, more videos. Um, the period blood we talked about, obviously, congratulations. What is this one? Well I think technique, this guy said this was funny from that by the way.

Speaker 1:          01:12:58       Questions, videos, suggestions, anything. Send them to podcast@hthreehthreeproductions.com. Love to hear from you guys. This one comes from Andrew Bentley. He said he learned about the wiping technique and he tried it out. But unfortunately on my third try with front wiping it ended in such tragedy had revert back to back wiping while I was trying to utilize the scoop technique. Um, my, my wrist accidentally make contact with Poo Poo, pee water. And needless to say, it's solidified my trust and the tried and true method of bandwidth. And how do you get, he says, unfortunately I have to conclude Ethan's wiping method is too dangerous. Second. Well what the fuck? How deep are yapping? Like when I not, when I say you have to lift your balls. I'm not kidding dude. Do you have to like lean back though? No. Do you cup your balls when you wipe for a back to front on a little unit but you grow.

Speaker 1:          01:14:03       I mean you have to like grab your Dick and balls right in one hand you can go around and doesn't not like talking. Well, the way I do it because I live my junk with one hand, I stretch it up and I, I don't dunk into the toilet, that's for sure. I mean, yeah, obviously keep your hand out of the toilet bowl, dude. I mean my God, the mechanic we need, we need to like get a life sized mannequin and like have like a full on demonstration. Don't need a mannequin. I'll show you right now. You bring this up and you just, you scoop right under like that. You got your leg up right now though. And see this is one of in objects. He's actually, he's got a different technique. Do you want to come show us the yet come show us. Come in here cause he in. Oh God, you're, yeah, you're being so lamb come shows how you wipe your ass.

Speaker 1:          01:14:59       Come on, get in here. Why do your legs and then side around you go directly under. Wait, what? How do you go? You Go, you go under the balls. I spread the legs wider and go around round. He goes around the mountain like crimp here. Sure. Come show us. Come on. I'm genuinely curious. This is the science episode. You're shaking his head. No way too embarrassed. I'm not blaming you. Hold on. Okay, well at least let me understand because now I'm intrigued. You go from like this? No, you go from the front. So you come like from like this, I can't see, oh you open your wet legs, wider leg like super wide. Right, right, right. And you don't go under him. You go around them, you sit like super while you got homework to do it. Wait, hold on. Do Shit with your legs that wide.

Speaker 1:          01:16:08       That's a wide stance he got. I don't go that wide. Oh I understand. So you scope it your Dick and balls to like the left because I put them up against my gut and you say Whoa, I'm trying to understanding cause you're not coming in here and showing me. All right. I'm tired of playing pictionary with to the solidarity between the front wipers. Is is cracking. You're the worst uh, pictionary partner I've ever had switching to back after that. No. All right, well I've got a conversion. He gets mad at me today. Embarrassed and a little bit, but um, her boyfriend doesn't even feel Acmr III and so there is a chance and I think I did lay a skewed either shaking her head. I'm very disappointed.

Speaker 1:          01:17:02       I what else we got. So that's about it. I have a lot of other submissions, but I think I'll save it with the hopeful, hopeful that Tom and Christina will come next week. So again, uh, somewhat, um, light episode. I'm very sick. I should stop talking immediately and get in bed. You are a champion for powering through this too. When you walked in today, I took one look at, he was like, fuck that dude is, it should be in bed. Right. Thank you for saying that Dan. The show must go on. You know, the show must go on and I'm, and I appreciate everybody who tuned in on this blessing lesson Friday and I appreciate all the boys and back who I want to always express my appreciation to Dan, the producer and interns, Zach the sound boy, love them all.
