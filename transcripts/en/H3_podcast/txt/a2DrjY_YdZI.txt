Thank you to today. Our sponsors are Robin Hood Express, Vpn and honey and I thank you all for joining us on this beautiful, splendid blessing. Friday. We are truly blessed to be enjoying a Friday together. God, you know, I saw one time I was at a store and someone in the checkout lady and she says to me, have a blessed day and I was like, I don't believe in God, but I just love that I have a blessed day. Like damn, like good day. No bless it. That's pretty nice. I was taught like the idea that God and all of his infinite power and wisdom was like this day is a blessed for you, for you and only you.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       I love that. Not only you, we're all blessed to have a blessed day. I just love it. So I have a bloodstained Friday. Everyone. We've got a lot to talk about. We're talking about better help. A lot of controversy there. We are talking about there's been a story that Lacroix Popular Sodie pop drink, which of which I'm a big fan, is being sued for putting cockroach poison in their drinks. Sounds a little far fetched. Horrible, but is it. Let's find out. We're going to take a deep dive. We've also got up a Kanye West, the great Kanye West a had a meeting with Donald Trump that has got a lot of people talking and so much more today on the. Join me under the Gazebo. Would you please experience. So let's start from the over in the Gazebo. Let's start from the top. You're better help. Okay. Now better help.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       I think that there's a lot of misconceptions going around. I'm not, we're going to take a deep dive. We've also. Oh no, that wasn't going the whole time. Was it? Okay, good. I'm not using my laptop is also right. Right. Okay. Alright. Where was that a Eli? Can you throw me under the customer better help? Um, there's been a lot of misconception about I'm, I'm, I'm talking about my involvement with better help. Okay. Um, let, let me start from the top. Better help is a, an online therapy service. Okay. Um, um, which they've sponsored one of our podcast episodes a couple of months ago. Okay. Now a lot of youtubers have been getting criticized lately for having put better help reads on their videos about mental health, about them being depressed and such. And a lot of people have been accusing them of being predatory because they're like, oh, I'm so depressed and here's better help.

Speaker 1:          00:03:12       They're accusing them of a exaggerating their depression to sell better help or to go to better help sponsor, I don't know. And then people started going through their terms of service and found some concerning things there as well of the service itself. In the terms of service. There was something I, I, I don't remember exactly. There was something like a, they can't guarantee that your conversations, private stuff like that. Like, like, you know, weird stuff. And so first of all, I want to make clear, okay. First of all, we had one sponsor with better help that was two months ago and the topic of mental health was not brought up in association with our read at all and to the best of my recollection, I don't think that we even talked about it in that episode and it predated our update video when I talked about being depressed by month a month at least.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       Okay. But here's where I think people got thrown off because Pewdie pie made a new video about it and he goes through the terms of service and he points out a lot of questionable things, which is fine and he doesn't like the service and he raises good points about it, but the way that he presented my involvement in it I thought was a little misleading and a little out of context and it made it look like I was way more involved with this company that I was. Or even that it made it look like I used my being depressed to somehow sell better help. So I want to show you guys if I could please exhibit a. It was. This is beauty pies video. Let me go back a little bit. So here, let's watch this. So he goes on here and he's talking about here.

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       I was just joking. By the way guys, everyone needs to sociopath enter the code. Shane, for your cheaper online therapy to date, I would never have guessed it was actually this was the case. So this leads to a lot of the sponsored videos of these 100, 100 of Youtube ers being about mental health, which could actually be a good thing, but they are made so that people sign up for the website. I'm Scott. It's Scott from depression to expression.

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       So he's saying there's all these you tubers that are promoting better health on videos about depression. He has a problem with that. He doesn't think that that's ethical. So here's, here's what he shows here.

Speaker 2:          00:05:34       If you're looking for anything to miss out on, don't miss out on this. Welcome to expression. Whoa. I actually messed up there and completely serious before we start. I have so much respect for each and every one of you for watching and being. Why do you ask for my payment information now? Okay. As we know have been in therapy, I've been

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       just dealing with a lot of stuff that I needed to deal with and I feel good anyways. I feel good. That's what is that probably about so you can access professional, affordable and convenient counseling. I just hit a wall where it was. It has gotten so bad that it was basically either stop making videos or disappear. Also, this video is sponsored by better health, more information about that, so the way it's cut makes it look like my video. My update video was sponsored by better health and that's what I felt when I saw it too. Yeah, and I thought it was. I was like, Whoa, like why would that be there? That gives totally the wrong impression because I've never talked about better health and depression. Ever fact, when I did the sponsoree two months ago, I didn't even endorse the product because I have never used the service.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       We checked it to make sure we checked it to make sure that within 24 hours a therapist contacted us and they did. So we did some due diligence in that regard to test out the service, but I never endorsed it. I never said that I used it to treat my depression either, but it seemed. But at any rate, let me, let me say, focus on this. Um, that seems like the only reasonable conclusion to make is that he's calling me out, which is, I thought I was like, Dude, what the hell? And I was, I was pretty upset with him and I contacted him directly and I was like, hey man, what, why, what's the deal? And he says he didn't, he didn't mean to make it look that way and he made a comment trying to clarify. But the people that read the comments compared to the people that watched the video is very small. Okay. So what happened here is that, um, Bobby Burns, this youtuber here made a video about depression that's sponsored by better help and he uses my clip in it talking about depression. So here, let me show you this anymore videos. I just hit a wall where it was gotten so bad that it was basically either stop making videos or disappear forever.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       So today's video is going to be about youtube happiness. We're get started. Make sure you hit that notification. Bell lets you know whenever I upload new videos also, this video is sponsored by Dell. You'll notice that it's from bobby's video, but he cut out the context so to understand either way because the part in pdfs video, it's just kinda like a super cut of examples of like it doesn't really inform the Butler affordable and convenient counseling. I just hit a wall but I think he did it. He didn't do it on purpose but I just want to clarify, you know, because it makes sense to us. It didn't make a difference to make a connection between being depressed and then from a company we didn't want to do that. That's my personal choice that we made so that it was kind of so. And I think that [inaudible] who's the biggest youtuber in the world talking about this, people take it seriously and it looks like it. I mean, that's how I interpret it. I could be wrong. I talked to a lot of other people that saw it that way too and it just seems like.

Speaker 1:          00:09:19       But you can see that basically either so they don't seem to know more information about that at the end of this video. So again, then he goes on to to criticize, criticize a lot of youtubers. He also doesn't really criticize them harshly, is more criticizing this service of better help names. He names a lot of people and he shows a lot of faces of people and you know, when you're Pewdie Pie, the effect of that is that. Yeah, he was, he was very, he was very tempered in his criticism. He wasn't like coming out. He was being very. He was being very rational and fair about it. I mean, I'm not saying, but again, I just want to clear that up that that video was not in any way sponsored by better. Hell yeah. We've only worked with them once so. Okay. But regardless of that, I think it's pretty weird that bobby used that clip anyway because I keep seeing that clip going around of bobby using my clip talking about depression, but there's not a clear separation. So people think that. But that's not the case. So let me just see here. I've got so

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       in response to the criticism. So first of all, I just want to make that clear. Okay. Now in response to their, I think that there was some implication that anyone that works with better help is negligent, a shill or irresponsible or somehow selling out their fans. And even though I never mentioned depression, am I read, I do disagree with that assertion. I do personally disagree with that assertion. Now let me talk about this. I'm not sure what. First of all, I'm not sure what I could do to vet them more than I did. I mean in a perfect world, I liked the service. It seems interesting and it seems like it would be useful for a lot of people. Like on face value. It seems like a cool service. They're owned by a publicly traded company and they're one of the most widely advertised services on the internet across television, radio, podcasting, and Youtube, so with all the information available, it's a perfectly rational decision to think that it's a good useful service and something that's good, good to promote and I mean, again, these guys are going through the terms of service and picking it apart and there's weird questionable stuff in there, but I don't think like this.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       It's a. it's a weird standard to make that you want the slit, the expectation that anyone you ever work with your reading, the entire 20 page legal document of a terms of service like I don't think anyone. Very few people in the history of youtube have ever read the terms of service and I'm willing to bet that if they did read the terms of service, they wouldn't want to work with them because terms of service is written to remove liability. So it always sounds bad. Terminal Service is meant to sound bad and scary. They're literally. The purpose is to remove liability, so to expect youtube. I don't think that's a slippery slope. If you are expecting everyone to read the terms of service, every partner that I've ever worked with, I mean on, on, on face value, it's as reputable as a, as a partner as you can.

Speaker 3:          00:12:36       Yeah. We've had some offers for responses that we declined that happens. But someone like better help, like past all the questions that you would normally ask, you know, is they do have good reviews online when we looked up.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       Yeah, of course. No. And people can promote people decide how they want to promote different products. I personally wasn't comfortable promoting it in terms of me being depressed and I wasn't personally comfortable saying I've used the service when I haven't, but it seemed good and it seems like it'd be useful and helpful. So I promoted it as such. Now, um, I think people are just a little too quick to throw others under the bus and be way overly cynical about this. Okay. Um, I understand that it can seem in poor taste to promote better help in a video about being depressed, which I didn't do for the record and I have never done. But from the flip side, think about it from their perspective. Someone like, like buggy felt the Franco, Bobby Burns, I don't know, Shane, everyone think of it from their side instead of being so cynical and thinking that there is this elaborate scam to them, it's a win win.

Speaker 1:          00:13:52       It's like, oh, this app is going to help people. It seems like a good service. And my videos promoted. It's like, you know, be optimistic about it and it feels like a one one. I mean, that's how sponsors as young Youtube I've always worked like content, like sponsors. If you have video game content, you have a video game sponsorship on it. If you make car content, our tech content, you have technology or car, like, like content, like sponsors. That's how it works. So it's easy to see where people have come from, thinking that it's okay to pair those up. It seems like a win win. Um, and so I completely understand where they're coming from. Um, and I think once again, people are thinking about it backwards. I think what has been happening is that better help because there's been this implication that people have exaggerated, being depressed to sell better help as that is a very powerful.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       It really shitty that would be very shitty and the people that I've seen being called out are people that I know have had a history with mental health issues and so I think it's kind of ironic to like real and dog pile on these people who already kind of fucked up. You know, I think what I think you guys have it backwards. The people who are being overly cynical, people who have spoken about mental health issues are the people that are being approached by better health. Right? So it's not, doesn't start from wanting to sell better help. It starts from having these issues and then better help comes in because they see an opportunity. I think that's how these partnerships have a happened. And then finally I've heard this argument that it's unethical for you tubers to even make money from promoting a service about mental health.

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       That I heard that it's unethical to take money for it, that it should be done for free even. And I. Well, who benefits from doing it for free? Better help, what you're going to do free copyrights for better help their business. You know, as a capitalist society, that's the way the world turns. I mean saying it's illogical for a utuber are immoral for youtube or to collect money to promote better health. Is, is, is similar to saying it, is it a moral for a doctor or therapist or nurse to get paid for their work because it benefits people. I mean this is a capitalist society. We, we. This is how, at what point, where does the red line, at what point does it become a moral right? There's therapists the charge $50 an hour, $200 an hour, $500 an hour. At what point does it become immoral for therapists to charge $50 an hour?

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       $500 an hour. So there's service not valuable. Is that not a capital is not a commodity. I mean, you know what I'm saying? If they're better at it too, they not deserve to get paid more. So this blanket statement that it's somehow immoral to sponsor online therapy strikes me as an odd one and not one that makes much sense. Especially considering, uh, here in the United States, our costs spittles are doctors. Everything Cancer Treatment for Christ sake is heavily monetized. And I personally find that to be disgraceful. But are we saying that they shouldn't get paid at all? They should. They volunteer. I mean, I, it's a, it's an argument that doesn't make much sense to you and it falls apart in my mind when you try to break it down. I mean, it's a nice, it's a nice thought, but it doesn't really make that much sense. Now, once again, I want to acknowledge this is somebody I worked with one time months ago and I never promoted them and context of being depressed and I never said that I used their service to treat my depression.

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       I'm not a doctor. I'm not journalist. I'm not a lawyer. This is my opinion. Feel free to disagree, but I've been watching this kind of devolve and I think that people are being way overly cynical about this and it's just another example of like, I don't know, it just feels like one of these things that just making youtube even more toxic, like even more distrustful of people and even more cynical of each other and to people and I just don't know why and and I, I dunno, it just didn't feel. It just doesn't feel right. This whole thing and sure some people are being opportunistic. Probably some, but not always going to happen to someone. Now there's, there's been a lot of controversy about filter Franco because he was apparently sponsor with them and do it. I don't know anything about what filter Franco's up to not commenting at all about that.

Speaker 1:          00:18:53       And I know like he had a bank connected somehow with Shane's better help. Sponsorship. He's not connected to us at all. Ours came through an agency, and let me say this, by the way, when you work with sponsors, we work with a lot of sponsors here on the podcast. They come through agencies that vet them, the check for their credibility, the collect payments and make sure they're legit. Okay. Because obviously, yeah, so obviously we as business owners and as entertainers are not going to read the terms of service. All of our partners. That's insane. Nobody has time for that. So we trust our agency to, to verify the legitimacy of these companies and I don't think they failed in this case. I mean we think about it too. I don't just pass the buck completely to them. I make a conscious decision to work with someone or not, but in this case I don't regret it. I mean like, yeah, there's some questionable things in terms of service, but let me say this with the information I had at the time I made the right decision.

Speaker 4:          00:19:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       and, and, and that's it. You know, I think if you want to criticize the company, that's one thing and that's totally fine, but to come at Youtube, Er's who have worked with them

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       seems overly cynical and toxic and it's just not. I don't know. It's just not necessary. I don't know. And you guys, another crutch of this argument is the implication that people don't. There's so many sponsors available on youtube now. You don't have to act depressed to get a sponsor on youtube. You really don't. I mean, I don't know. It just makes it. I don't know. That whole thing just made me feel really sad. I felt really bad. Honestly, when I saw Felix is video and kind of the way it was portrayed. I'm not gonna lie, I felt it felt really awful and I didn't mean to do it, but like I didn't want people to think. I know a lot of people were getting the wrong. A lot of people went in and I felt bad for all the other people he named two because it's like these are people that are already sensitive and dealing with stuff and it's like. It's like, man, I dunno. Just overly cynical. And again, I chose not to talk about my depression. People make decisions. I didn't want to do that, but that's just my opinion. You can feel free to disagree with me and that's fine. Okay. We can have dissenting opinions. You don't have to come fucking murder my family and shit down my throat because I happen to have my own opinion about this. I think youtube has gotten way too fucking toxic way to overly cynical and when you start throwing good, honest youtubers under the bus

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       that I think there, I think we need to reel it back a little bit. You know, there's some that's like, I'm not saying that people shouldn't be criticized, but it's like, I dunno, just whatever just felt bad. The whole thing felt bad. So that's, that's, that's my take. And I hope that you won't come to my house at 3:00 AM and attempt to murder me over on his dissenting opinion because it's not that serious after all. And if you. And if you are thinking that you may consider hopping over to [inaudible] dot com slash eight, three talking to the therapist. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:22:21       God.

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       Okay. I think I handled that. Okay. I didn't get too upset, right? No, I don't. I'm not trying to throw shade at anyone. I'm not trying to be controversial. I'm not trying to stir the pot. I'm tired of feeling like everyone is out to get. Everyone's looking at might feel ironic coming from now. Okay. Let me acknowledge that somebody who said who's notorious for, you know, making fun of people online. Yeah. But Hey, that's just my opinion.

Speaker 4:          00:22:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       On this topic specifically,

Speaker 4:          00:23:02       all right

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       also, well, whatever. I think I put that to rest. We've got lacroix. You guys have all heard. We're almost to a break, but let me set this up and then we'll go to a break. Lacroix, the Saudi pop of choice. Crack open a fresh one. Cheers. Now, a lot of you probably heard this headline that Lacroix is being sued for putting unnatural chemicals and it's drink. Yes. Sip it appealing. I'm a limonene. How do you say that? Lemo nine Lemo Nini. Lemoni. It's a chemical that is also inside cockroach insecticide. Now this is a heavily that has been widely seen around social media crash. People have been texting me. Chris delea texted me. He's like, dude, what the fuck? Because we're both a little croix. I didn't even drink water anymore. I'm a lacroix. Seriously? Not a joke. Don't drink water dude. Fuck that peasant juice waters called as inches. Now this is cochrane is well, is it? You know when the Lacroix came out it was a high. It was a top shelf beverage. I remember it was really expensive, but now they saw what happened. It's all on sale all the time. It's like three bucks for 12 pack or something. Yeah, Dude. Fucking brutal man. They're competing with water and you believe that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       So anyway, listen to me. It sounded far fetched. So I wanted to take a deep dive. What's at stake? Who are the players who benefits the most from this? And is it true that the Lich the Lacroix controversy or Lacroix Gate? Stay tuned after this break. We will dive right into that here on the podcast. Gazebo experience. Join me under the Gazebo.

Speaker 1:          00:30:41       Welcome back. My little gazebos. Um, before we get into, is Lacroix poison? I want to say new age three video out, which was a lot of fun. Honestly. I got to say I really want this one. I took my time, I enjoyed the process. I took all the time I needed on. We worked on it for like two weeks and I would just sit down and edit and enjoy the experience and the sketch and everything. So I think that I really enjoyed and the reception was amazing. I mean everyone was really happy about it. I got to say I didn't think. I don't think I saw one complaints actually have a collection of them for you. If you want me to read those off real quick, you know, I'm just going to do it. There's no complaints guys. Why don't we sit over in the Gazebo and it felt good. I think me and Isla realized, I think recently we felt Ngozi boys because the boys.

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       I like that. That feels special. Are you a busy boy? Z Boys? Maybe we should name our child [inaudible], but that's a good like gender neutral name because just given birth under a gazebo. You know, how people have all these weird like given water waterpool a gazebo. Birth a blessing because it's a beautiful thing. I feel like, um, I've seen some people echoing the sentiment that I, I have spoken a lot of times that I don't want to be making videos like that, but I feel like recently I have always wanted to go back to making videos like that and just until recently we weren't meant. Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean, that's what it was really. It was just that I, I, I literally couldn't. I don't know what it was, but recently we really felt like we wanted to try and go back to making like high quality.

Speaker 3:          00:32:46       I feel like they can embrace for like we didn't make a video. It's like three months and kind of started to crave the feeling of like being creative and doing something.

Speaker 1:          00:32:54       Yeah, that's what it was born from that we really wanted to say, okay, let's make the best video. We can not cut any corners. There's no deadline. And so that's what we did. And it was fun. It was great. I loved everything. So hopefully more to come. Um, so anyway, I'm glad you guys enjoyed and thanks for all the wonderful comments and support tomorrow and Los Angeles for all of our La based [inaudible] boys. Um, where, what, what time is it at now? You're surprising me with you can just google rip into right store. But what time is it at? 11. Hold on. All right, well either. Does that check out? This new teddy fresh? What do you call this track suit? Warmer. It's a tracksuit tracksuit that's coming out this winter. They get this fresh shit. The fit is insane. The comfort level. This shit is spicy hot. It's breathe, dude. This thing is insane. This is so comfortable. I mean it was my goal for a long time to Mecca tracks. Ketty fresh watch out. Watch out haters. Because Teddy fresh is calming hard.

Speaker 3:          00:34:07       So it's at 11:00 AM tomorrow,

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       Tomorrow at 11:00 AM at [inaudible] store. It's next to the supreme store. And is it Hollywood and La Fairfax Avenue effect. So we'll be there for about an hour or two and got the new rip indep collection. Co Lab coming out. Very excited about. So. So he goes there and um, let's do it. Is Lacroix poison? That is the question we are looking to resolve today. Who are the players at work? Who benefits from this? Before we get into this lacroix boy, uh, under the Gazebo. A story I'd like to say cheers to everybody in the boys and back to enjoy everyone. Crack Open Your Lacroix and have a nice refreshing sip of all natural essence sodie pop.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       That's good. So a new lawsuit alleges that a lacroix is not all natural and the chemical limonene in Lacroix is also an cockroach insecticide. Now, one thing that I thought, first of all when I heard that is just because it's toxic to cockroaches, doesn't necessarily mean anything. You hear shit like that all the time. Like our neighbors, the vet, he says, chewing gum, artificial sweetening, chewing gum is deadly poisonous to dogs. Just because it's toxic to cockroach doesn't like. That. Seems like an effort to scare. Like if it's dangerous to humans, say that it's dangerous to cockroaches. Cockroaches are gross and I have a mental image of dead cockroaches, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything besides that. So that seems kind of manipulative headline. So at first something, what's going on here? You know, is this really about the ingredients or something else at play?

Speaker 1:          00:36:01       So let's actually break down these claims from the lawsuit who were making these claims. All right, let's start with the chemical Lemo Nini. Am I saying that right? Or am I just sound like an idiot? A feeling? You're not saying, how could I? It cannot be called limonene. And then somebody for Christ sake help me. I'll check gleam on any line. One nine. Oh Lima nine. That's gotta be it. That sounds way more intelligent in America. And I'm so bad at pronounciating things. It's like ridiculous. Alignment nine, I think it's Lima nine. Damn. You killed it. You just read it like someone from outside of the US, would it? Well, I'm sorry. My brain is fucked up. So pub cam, the National Institutes of health open database for chemical compounds explicitly calls Lima Nine, a naturally occurring chemical and a major component of oil extraction from citrus peels. So sounds pretty natural, right?

Speaker 1:          00:36:57       As the name suggests, limonene is commonly used to give food or other products a lemony flavor and fragrance. So it is a naturally occurring compound that comes off of lemons. So Lima, Lima Damn crushed it. You're fucking spelling bee champ. So how about the claims that it causes kidney toxicity and cancer while the same company pub cam also states there is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenic properties have limonene. There is some evidence of male rats experiencing problems including tumors as a consequence of limonene exposure. But none of those findings have been properly reproduced in humans. Meanwhile, more recent study suggests that limonene is actually anti cancer. It's lemon. I mean it's a naturally occurring lemon. Now, how did this company come to claim that it's even unnatural? Because I was reading that the FDA, because everything that FDA does is so nebulous and undefined, defines for whatever reason, lemo nene as artificial flavor.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       But according to this magazine, and I don't know what the reason is for that. Is it a naturally occurring chemical that comes from lemon? Okay. Now the other chemical that's being accused of being toxic is Lena Lou. I. Why? Why can I not really? You know, Lou, it's spelled L I n a l o l that's a goofy ass word. Lena Lou as another additive used as a flavoring agent. It's naturally occurring. Found within many types of flowers. Spice plants, including the nights. Yeah. It includes meant centered herbs, laurels, and cinnamon. It is most definitely used an insecticide as well. That part is true, but that doesn't mean it's poisonous to humans. After all, as I pointed out, dogs can eat chocolate, get I eat 20 bars a day. Explain that you can't.

Speaker 1:          00:39:15       The only real toxic effects of Lena Lou has been documented to inflict on humans is mild skin and eye irritation, namely from air assault, from air forms of the chemical being supported in your eyes. For example, take 11. Squirt it in your eyes. Oh, I'm going to sue the lemon people. No, that's not how it works. Folks. Also, coincidentally, research suggests that it may be an anticancer ingredient that leaves only lionel prop property such as Lionel property and a proper proper property and a like back in fifth grade trying to read again, read to the class even. Can you read a paragraph in front of the class? And it's like, oh my God, I can't remember half these words. That leaves Lionel prep innate derived from plants like ginger and lavender and another common flavoring and fragrance additive. It has been shown to help inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer. I'm going to show those. Wrap up my ass at least in the form of Nagani Kumquats. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:40:28       uh, so there you go. So unless Lacroix is secretly including 50 percent of the beverage as Lionel, then drinkers don't have anything to fear because it's not even anywhere close to being harmful. These are all naturally occurring flavors. And by the way, these are all flavors that many companies use and many of their products to flavor their beverages. I mean it makes it act like Lacroix is out there. Just a pouring coke, gross insecticide for no reason. Like I'm going to save fifty cents and pour some pointed at as. No. This is a widely used flavoring agent that seems by all accounts to be natural after all. So what's going on here?

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       What is going on? What is going on? Let me say this. Even water is toxic. When you consume too much, you can actually get water poisoning. Okay? No, that's an incredible sued a water. I'm assuming big water. Now, as somebody who's been on the receiving end of bogus lawsuits, this place, this lawsuit stinks to high. Heck, okay. Now Mike Theory, big soda is behind it and I. That might sound like a joke, but think about it. The company Lacroix dominates, dominates the market. If you go to any grocery store, any convenience store gets what's on the shelf and guess what? People want Lacroix every time. Isla, please. Let's not get into that. Now. That's a whole nother heated debate. Look, they got a great marketing. I don't know what. I don't know how, but they dominant like I've. I've slammed Lacroix previously on the podcast was like these motherfuckers act like they invented soda water, but here I am drinking it every episode. So what's going on now at the same time as Lacroix is killing it and I'm talking about $827,000,000 in sales last year. Guess what's simultaneously declining hugely and sales soda, sugary drinks as people realize that consuming 50 grams of sugar is poison and not lie on the oil or whatever. How about 50 grams of sugar? Can we sue Coca Cola for giving me diabetes? I'd like to.

Speaker 1:          00:43:04       Maybe I will. So here we have lacroix dominating the market. Big Soda falling down. What's happening now? The these big boys are losing market share to Lacroix and their soda water brands are are getting smashed, they're dominating the market. And these big soda companies, they they need to get in because their business is suffering.

Speaker 1:          00:43:30       So to me from the outside, it seems like a total hit job of misinformation and the lawsuit is going to get thrown out. You can trust me on that, but the damage has already been done because I hear it on the news, I see it on social media, I see it everywhere at once. And it stuck in your head. I know. And a know fucked up is that nobody goes, nobody goes, oh, that's weird. That doesn't make that much sense. They say they go, what? There's poison in Lacroix. We're all fucking going to die. We drink lacroix. And they have successfully

Speaker 1:          00:44:08       tarnish the reputation of this pristine, beautifully branded and naturally flavored sodie pop. And that's it. That's the beauty of this lawsuit. It's totally bogus. It's going to get thrown out and they have tarnished the reputation and everybody's been taken the bait. And meanwhile Mr Coca Cola has got his feet up and he's drinking lacroix. He knows it's the security of beverage. But meanwhile he's pedaling his fucking nasty coca cola bullshit. So I say to all of our listeners, all the [inaudible] boys out there, crack open a lacroix, have a sip and enjoy yourself and know that you are enjoying an all natural sugar free beverage. And you are, you are a lacroix boy. Your Gazebo. Boy, you are my boy. So have a sip and enjoy. Cheers everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       Cheers. Isla, you really? That's allowed 70 though. I tried on purpose. So that's it. Nice to have bunked two big topics. Sixty minutes is this 60 minutes colgate. I was working on my Alex Jones impression. I thought it was pretty good. I did it during one of the, the uh, copywriters, but we cut it, but I kind of want to do it now. Kanye. Kanye gave trump, make America great hat during his White House visit. And it really hurts my throat though. It's pretty good. I need to figure how to do it where it doesn't irritate my throat. Yeah. Kanye gave trump will make America great hat during the White House visit. Purple Hat. You guys heard about all this? Kanye west madness. Um, okay. So let's talk about Kanye West. No good. That Kanye met trump and we're going to talk about that, but before we do in our intern, who's a super fan of Kanye West says you will know, um, had some suggestions for Kanye West last week and our previous episode, he had suggested that he make the hat purple, which would symbolize the joining of the Democrats and the Republicans. They're red and the blue. Exactly. Red And blue makes purple cares. Here's Kanye and a purple hat.

Speaker 1:          00:46:31       Not Evidence of much. Honestly, we had thought that it said make America great. You can't really read it, can you? It doesn't say that though,

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       but interesting. What does it say? Showing up. Inappropriate hat says exposed world says Ian because he knows those world, but what he did, and then his other suggestion in suggestion was don't wear a hat that says make America great again. Hat that says make America great. Yeah. And what happens later on that day, my friends. Well, I can't open it some behind that picture. It is, yeah. Good job. He'll make America great. This is, I'm telling it now. People have suspected that Kanye lurks the reddit of Kanye on Reddit and the clip, the highlight of and talking about it was that subreddit. So there is a chance, I swear to you now that Kanye West saw Ian suggestion and if he comes out with a purple, make America great hat, which is a great idea and I hope he does the world. Oh my God. That is going to be amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       How well. Well, how, how do you, how did you feel in seeing this? I saw you. You seem pretty excited. Yeah, I mean I was pretty proud of myself. Do you think that he saw your presentation? I'm going to tell myself that. Yeah, I hope you did. Do you think there's a chance though, or do you think. I mean like not going to fully commit because it's not purple. If it was purple, I'd go he, yeah, but well, based on a percentage out of 100, what are the chances do you think you saw that your presentation, the clip got a lot of views. That was six days ago before he did that. It's interesting timing and this looks like a shitty one. Not like the design one. He pooped it out real fast. Yeah. You could just buy a red hat and the embroidery. Can you give me a percentage? Say 50. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:48:40       That's gotTa. Make you feel amazing. Oh yeah. He better send me a hat. That's the least he could do. Look us up. Wow. I hope he takes. Would you wear it in if it was purple and said make America Great. What if it was a one? If it's red, he's like, no, I don't kind eat on the street. I wouldn't wear it if it was red. No, if it was purple, I feel like I kind of have to know what the fuck you can't. Yeah. I love that. You wouldn't wear. You wouldn't wear it. Well. Anyway, so there's that and so we all congratulate in. He's really grown up. We're all very proud of him. What the fuck going on? We're all very proud of an intern. He's really flourished. He's turned into condos. Personal advisor really just come into his own, so I want to say thank you to end the intern.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       He's great, and when we first saw that purple hat, there was that moment where we thought that was it. That was a freak out. That was like, are you kidding me? But 50 percent though, Dan. I mean that's nothing to be scoffed. Yeah. No, I mean I think he's probably right. I mean from what I understand, yeah, he, he legitimately is like, he's a worker. He's on the Kanye Fan. For how many points did it have on the rabbit in? Well, it wasn't on the, reddit was on the fence. Oh Man. Forum. And how was it received? A people were onboard connecting everyone to shit on me and yeah, that would be interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:50:10       Well maybe not him personally, but you know, I bet some of his handlers probably do check out, you know, let's just go, go, let's go with that. Wow. That's, that's really exciting. Well, did you out your user name then if you posted our wellness? Someone else posted it? Yeah. Yeah, he's still clear your alerts on the them, you didn't post it. Did you end up denying it? Fuck, it was definitely y'all know his account. Um, but anyway, so Kanye met with trump and there's a lot of blow back as you can expect, but I'm here to focus on the funny, the whimsical, the comedic.

Speaker 4:          00:50:58       Um,

Speaker 5:          00:51:00       so here's, here's

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       one great moment.

Speaker 4:          00:51:03       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       you can see Kanye password on his phone came in. I was like, Ian, what's funniest password? And he's like just zeros as I come in and he's like five, like you're fucking crazy to six 67. Six. Okay. Yeah, you said 5:10, but I guess he's revised his. He said he went back into and this whole thing,

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       ellen on one of his legendary I airplane the airplane. We have a picture that but trump card. Interesting cognition. Just going off for like 20 minutes and dominating the conversation and I find it just so interesting that, oh, how do I get that Angle Bac this angle here? He doesn't really look at trump when he's talking and trumps faith. Is he just sitting there kind of embracing this angle is all is in the one I wanted for Christ sake. What else? We got up? Kanye is a smart as tesla and Freud. See if ben can decode this.

Speaker 5:          00:52:18       I was conducted with a neuropsychologist that works,

Speaker 4:          00:52:23       Matt,

Speaker 5:          00:52:24       but the athletes in the NBA, the NFL, and he looked at my brain, go ahead, drop some bombs for you. Ninety eight percent top out you test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards afterwards. Repeat something going to work on that one. The other one's 98 percent tesla. Freud, you know, so

Speaker 1:          00:52:51       I guess he's trying to say he's very intelligent. Am I correct in that? And he's definitely coming across that way. And you're not commenting really. I think he's pursuing his words, but uh, he's got the whole forum listening on everyday. Things got so complicated for men. You know what I'm saying? Like you can't just take tuck his opinion anymore. He's a leader. He's a thought leader on it by his PR and influencer. I know what you need to pr now. Can't have the. He's got a reputation now. He doesn't have some bullshit username he's faced. They know who he is. He has a reputation. If he says the wrong thing, this called Bob's coming from. Yeah. This goes beyond username. This is real shit. Well, Ian, can you at least confirm he's, he's trying to say that he is intelligent.

Speaker 6:          00:53:47       Yeah, that's the general idea. Yeah. I mean it's once again, like the powerpoint where I showed all the people you can compare themselves, surprises, Freud and a tesla. Wasn't the in there.

Speaker 1:          00:53:59       And who was the, uh, the Disney character. Oh, that's vanilla pea von sweets, sweets. He should have said, I'm like sweet. Then as counting eight numbers. Gosh, we're gonna work on it. And we were working on not doing the math anyway, the other one's 98 percent tests. Look Freud, you know, so he knows, say confidence, you know what I'm saying? But anyway, so that was the number one rock star on the planet. So that was interesting. And then there was the one, I guess the one that really pissed people off was that he hugged trump at the end and we saw this doctor or this and this isn't God. He showed him a picture of what does this even in hell. Yeah. And decode.

Speaker 6:          00:55:00       It's not his design. He took it from someone who did it as they're a university thesis a few years ago, and the guy, they asked him, they were like, what do you think about this? He's like, I think it's got a cool that Connie saw it. He didn't care that I have no idea how.

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       So what are the chances we're going to get this air force one made in zero percent. Okay. Alright. Hater form's gonna eat you alive for that one. So bring back that picture. You love them all wearing hats. Yeah. Connie, I gave. Um, I wanna see I wanna. See Jared Kushner. He looks like such a Dweeb. Um, you can see the whole family here and one says, make earth the greatest again. Make earth great again. Earth is like, don't talk for me. It says, yeah, I know jared cracks make earth grade again. And travel space again. Make Earth grade again. What does that mean? One was earth.

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       Earth used to be fucking dope when the dinosaurs were around, maybe played out, played out, and it would carry. It looked so uncomfortable in that hat, man. But they're, they're making them work, they're rocking it, they're making it work. What's the Blue Ones Day? That's the earth. That's the black line. Says travel space again. So you can, you can get that out, get that out of there. So then we've got the hug, the notorious hug, which apparently now I was like in what? Because they're, the backlash has been so severe and I've read some things like Tei, the famous rapper, what he wrote. I was like, damn, that is fucking harsh. And their friends on my read it for you guys. But I was like, Ian, what? What exactly did he say that that upset people so much. And what in? Well, in you want to say what you told me? Or is that too controversial? I don't remember that. He didn't say anything new. It was kind of the same antics. It's the same content from the last six months. But I guess what happened is he showed a lot of love and he hugged trump and that's what set people off. So extend them together and made it all medium. So here it is.

Speaker 5:          00:57:26       Well that I like and I guess they liked me and we're going to have lunch. We're gonna talk. You don't want to take. I don't want to put you in that spot, but standing in that spot. I love this guy right here.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       I did the secret service. Not tackled his ass right now.

Speaker 5:          00:57:50       I love this.

Speaker 1:          00:57:54       Got You. It was all a long call and there was like a plot to a movie like that where he tries to get close to the king. Some Kung Fu movie hero. Yeah. That movie's sick. What did it make sense of? Konya was like the star of his own hero and he just stabbed trump. That'd be a wild twit. Everyone's like, whoa,

Speaker 5:          00:58:19       no, but he didn't. He didn't stab him

Speaker 1:          00:58:21       and it gave him some love and in fact that probably ruined the moment for you guys. So let me go back. I have a bad habit of pausing and talking a lot and isla was trying to correct me, but it was too late. I already paused it. So here we go again for everyone to enjoy.

Speaker 5:          00:58:37       Well, people that I like and I guess they liked me and we're going to have lunch. We're going to talk. I don't want to take. I don't want to put you in that spot,

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       dude. I'm sorry. I got to get all these people. There's so many people from so many press. It's actually really annoying. You can't even hear what they're saying. Cameras that can take pictures. Do you need. What the fuck does she know about cameras? Taylor? I'm. Yeah. Okay. I'm not going to pause it anymore.

Speaker 5:          00:59:11       That's fine. I love this guy right here. Let me get this. I love this guy right here. Really

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       hard. I didn't want to put you in that present. There you go. Okay, now let me read the response to the flavor. The reaction. This, uh, this was cold blooded man. This, this, you know what happened? He got

Speaker 1:          00:59:39       go. Sarah did. I was trying to. He got ghost started by a t I. and do you agree this was a ghost starting? Yeah, it was a good start. Definitely goes right. So let me read this shit now. I've been extremely patient and made it a point to not jump to any premature conclusions about you and his antics, partially due to the lessons learned from the outcome of other similar situation dealing with my brother Wayne, which I mailed him mishandled a bit in hindsight, but now this shit is next level futuristic sambo hopping Bob Steven off. Django ass shit. What does that mean in

Speaker 1:          01:00:15       those are all references to. It's sort of like the, the uncle Tom thing. What a sambo. Uh, that was, uh, it was a book that had like very racist imagery, I believe. I'm not exactly sure, but then he refers to Django, which obviously that was the term Tina movie. Sure. Okay. Literary references very, uh, eyebrow. You know, from what I can gather, this is the most repulsive, disgraceful, embarrassing act of desperation and auction off of one solid again, power I've ever seen. Now I recall you asking me to come with you to have this meeting and I declined naturally, but bro, if ain't time, I would've been in there with you and you behave that spinelessly in my presence. I feel I'd be compelled to slap the fuck out of you, Bro, for the people you asked, kissing and boot licking on a whole new level, and I refused to associate myself with something so vile week and inconsiderate to the effect this has on the greater good of all of our people.

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       I'm a true believer in it ain't what you do, it's how you do it and this shit is regurgitating at one time. It was a pleasure to work alongside you. Now I'm ashamed to have been associated with you. To all the people who follow. You. Use the Yay. Oh fuck. Yay. Right? Yes. Kanye was not part of a former. Anything of people. Don't judge, so other people will follow. Yay. Musically, socially, or even personally who are confused, heartbroken and fear. Eat. Let me make this clear. This shit ain't cool. This is all in caps. This is a movie made. Yay. Yes. Yay. Made for Yay. This is a play to put him in position. He'd liked to see himself in. We are not on his mind as he makes these comments in decisions. Don't follow this puppet where we're off caps now because as long as I've lived, I've learned that it benefits a man. Nothing at all to gain the world if to do so, he must lose his soul. We just saw Mr. West soul on auction. If you listen closely, can hear the tears of our ancestors hit the floor. All I can say is I've reached my limit. This is my stop. I'm officially done. Middle Finger trump and his little cooky boy.

Speaker 1:          01:02:34       Wow. That's cold blooded shit. How did, how did you, how did that make you feel in. I mean, I, I can't fully weigh in on what that imagery feels like or to see that if you're, you know, uh, African American in this country. I don't know. So yeah, I, I completely understand it. I see why he would have that. And you know, I respect his opinion. They're very political. One t I did from what I understand was like his most ardent defender up to this point, is that true in opinion is working on campaigning now. It's a tough situation for them. I can only imagine that's got it as if I'm calling you for. Yeah, that's good. When I read it and it's hard to disagree when this stuff that saying so I don't know. Like we said last time, like you can see what kind of was trying to do, but in it's not a pure art movement. It's bullet, political and then it should be. I guess it's, it's just so polarizing. It's like on one hand I see where he's coming from and on the other hand I see the black community as seeing Donald Trump as a symbol of oppression of establishment or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       Yeah. No, but I also see like, I dunno, I see it from both sides. I can't really think he's going to try and run for president to. I don't think so. Fucking cringey Bro. Please. No, not support. And do you vote for Kanye would never vote for it because I liked it. Doesn't that kind of run everything? What is. So if he's read love is president or is it just as he. Is he just trying to get political? What is this? Is he trying to be genuine and spread love and like bridge the divide or. So you just want to run for president positioning himself because that's what Tai was saying and I was like, yeah. And the conversation was very like about Kanye, like it was talking about yeezy and Adidas and how now. So strange lands are a billion. Oh yeah, no. Yeah. And it's Kinda like, what is the conversation with Kanye?

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       Watching his rent strikes me very much as somebody who is having a manic episode, he's been diagnosed as bipolar and when I see him talking there, he strikes me as someone that's not fully grounded, you know what I'm saying? And so I take that into consideration too. Yeah. And Mike, he's feeling strong more than usual emotions because he's in this manic state. And so he's like, I love trump. I love what he represents as someone who did something that was impossible, I love what the idea of what he's trying to do of like bringing jobs back to America and America first. Right? Kanye sees that as he just sees the best in it. He sees the positive message and he doesn't and there's a lot of people that criticize that movement, but he just, he's full with strong emotions in love and this manic state and so that's, he's not, he's not being smart. He's being emotional and so it's like A. Y'all really says that it was it in the snl speech. He straight up says like, we need to start thinking with our minds and start thinking with our hearts.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       So I think he's just, he's not an A. I don't think he's grounded right home and apparently or well we are noticing earlier he talks about how he was misdiagnosed as bipolar and he was just sleep deprived and so he's off his medicine and I'm watching this and be like, dude, you must be really sleep deprived right now if that's the case. So I don't know. The whole thing is just wild and weird. Is he going to run as a republican because that's kind of what he's angling for. Independent. He might just try and do his own thing. What a circus. That would be a real circus. Maybe he wants vp trump. Kanye. Won't that be a wild world? God. So that is Kanye decoded here on 60 minutes.

This went viral. Look at his outfit. First of all, he's got boots for kicking and that's just what he'll do. No spoilers. Imagine kicking somebody. Just imagine kicking somebody like how fucking unstable that you have to be to throw a kick. I have I ever kicked anyone who can. Like, if you're not enough UFC fighting rings. There's no like throwing a kick. Like, who are you? Bruce? Lee,

Speaker 7:          01:09:45       what? Hey, destruction of private property, you get raped by somebody and they're like, hi, I'm a 16 year old and I can have this

Speaker 1:          01:10:03       really compelling. I am pro choice by the way, for I'm. I'm strongly in favor of pro choice. I'm just going to say that for the record. Okay, and if you think that makes me a cook or whatever, that's fine because we can have a difference in opinion. I respect that you are pro life. How about that? You fucking haters. You can have an opinion and I can have a different opinion. Do you want to come to my dressing? Kill me because I'm pro choice. Suck my tiny Jewish Dick. But this guy's a fucking idiot. So it's fun to watch.

Speaker 7:          01:10:40       It's a baby. Get someone who was raped and she gave birth and she decided to kill her

Speaker 1:          01:10:44       by the way. Oh, Holy Shit. No, I did the perfect. I just wanted to say like people who are pro life, I understand their point because it comes from a religious place and they think you're murdering a baby. I personally disagree. I don't think you're murdering a baby, but if you did think that, then I can understand how you get and why would you be so passionate about it. So it's like it's just slick. Unsolvable. Yeah, it's killing babies. Killing babies. It's like, I can't think of two more opposites. Killing a baby. Worse thing ever. Not killing a baby, you know? I don't think it's killing baby. This guy certainly doesn't. You got to go back a little because I think this guy should have been aborted. Oof, oof

Speaker 5:          01:11:39       child.

Speaker 1:          01:11:47       I met the kick your phone. Okay, well who does that imagine kicking someone's phone? It's still assault defendant. He doesn't really apologize either. He's just like, I fucked up. I kicked you in the face or phone. Look at that tongue out. It's like an animated movie. I can probably run with his arms back.

Speaker 5:          01:12:14       I didn't kill her three year old child.

Speaker 1:          01:12:16       He rounds up, baby. Take your swaying hip into it. Here we go. That's basically a warning shot. You know, you heard in world war two and World War Two and Israel does it over like Gaza. They'll drop leaflets and say, Hey, we're about to bomb this place. Get better. Get Out. That's what he's doing. Dropping leaflets on, hey, it's about to go down. Can you say that you clear the area because a bomb is about to drop.

Speaker 5:          01:12:49       Oh, wow. That's a crazy kick. I doubt that guy will, as much power to be frank. Can we slow motion? Not here.

Speaker 1:          01:13:01       Let's, let's go to point two five on this. Break it down. Um, speed point two, five. Let's enjoy. Okay, go ahead.

Speaker 5:          01:13:13       Oh, that sounds cool. Let's make it about it. I love how the conversation is over and very powerful. I'm like, he probably doesn't have a lot of muscle mass, but he runs a well formed kick right there. Sounds a towel.

Speaker 1:          01:13:41       There you go. Everyone enjoyed that one. That was a favorite of the week. Uh, Shane continues his documentary about Jake Paul. I don't have that much to say about any of his new series except for this. This was my favorite detail that came out of the new episode. It's a small little detail, but I thought it was great. I'll share it for you guys. Now what? What's the school bus? So my dad's

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       a good old Greg Paul. It's actually like an rv though. I'm going to give you a quick tour and the bus give you an update. It's like you can like renovate. Yeah, there's like a. there's like a bed in there and he drives around and like he sleeps in there. My Dad,

Speaker 1:          01:14:29       his dad has lived at the 10th one house per months, sleeping and a school van outside the house. Now a guy who's been accused of having sex with underage girls and kissing underage girls on camera should not be sleeping in a school bus outside a house with a bunch of young kids. All right, Greg Ball. Get your fucking shit together. Get your life together and get the fucking move out of the school bus for Christ's sake. Greg. What the Hell is wrong with you

Speaker 5:          01:14:57       as a Weirdo? I love that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:02       Weirdest. God Damn Shit. I read Paul, man. Walk me your life together, man. God, that's it. That's my uh, that's my takeaway. Banksy. Shreds is art and whatever some bullshit. Should I talk about this? See Shreds his art.

Speaker 1:          01:15:26       It's kind of cool except it was kind of also lane if I'm being honest because. Well here let's watch video. So banksy sold a piece of art or. No, he didn't sell. I don't know how came to be in the front of his art. So he sold it originally and then it was recently. I don't know. Sorry. Yeah, I believe in being auctioned. I think the story goes that he built the shredder into it. I'm like 10 years ago with the intention that it, if it ever went on auction he would do this. So this is like a long con, but what I'm wondering is if he is so anti capitalist, he originally sold the art to somebody. Right? Like how did the auction house get it? That's a very good question. I mean the guy is rich. Very rich. Okay. So I don't really understand.

Speaker 1:          01:16:15       Okay. So it's not really a. is it a statement? I'm not sure. What was the statement? Just to gag. Gotcha. Okay. It's like, just like an actual quilt prank. I thought he was like an anticapitalist didn't sell his work kind of thing. Someone explicitly, he doesn't sell his work, like I remember hearing a story about how someone had a bunch of his work on display and they were charging him to get in and he was super unhappy about that because you can buy prints over the art and I'm sure Monday won't go so well. I don't know much about him so nobody knows.

Speaker 4:          01:16:52       Right.

Speaker 1:          01:16:55       That's some. That's what I think. Just I just had to blast you with those. All right, so here we go.

Speaker 8:          01:17:10       In a thread into the brain

Speaker 5:          01:17:19       and there you have it. Years later sold for one point $4, million dollar they're adopting and, and the minute it closes somebody with a real mode activated it. Who was there not that a big ass smile on it. It's a shame. It didn't complete it because they were able to preserve it. So that's why I think like it's done

Speaker 1:          01:17:56       so beautifully to the, like the paper didn't get crumbled or anything. It's just like. So is it? So again that's my question is about his intention because I don't think his intention was to destroy it

Speaker 1:          01:18:09       because it only shreds half. And then it stopped. I think it's a statement because she just, someone just paid one point 4 million for this up since he did it. So now, not only is it a valuable piece of history, I know it's part of his theory of art. I mean it's pretty cool that he pulled that off. I'm just confused about the message because it increased the value and it seemed like he intentionally didn't destroy the whole painting. I don't care that much and I don't think it matters that much. I think it was still a cool moment. People were freaking out, like all of a sudden this paper shredding itself. Right? Well, it's possible. It was an intentional that it fucked up. Like if he really built this thing 10 years ago, like malfunction, I'm sharing you that this would raise the volume just because that's how art goes that moment. That never happened before. So yeah. I mean it's brilliant. It's brilliant that long. You waited patiently for 10 years for this beautiful model where some idiot, I don't want to call them an idiot.

Speaker 1:          01:19:13       I'll put it this way. Kurt Vonnegut, I love this saying, and I'm not talking, you can spend 10, 20, $30,000 on a piece of art and culture, but when you start spending like millions, you're paying for prestige, right? Yeah. Kurt vonnegut has this great quote. He says, art is a conspiracy between the rich and and like the, uh, end the art world to make. I said, that's so bad to make people feel stupid. Or is it a conspiracy between rich people and artist to make poor people feel stupid because you see a painting sold for 20 million bucks and you're making $30,000 a year and you're like, what the fuck? Now the funny stories that some other guy who owns a print shredded it carries more weight, is do we have a picture of that? Oh, that's funny. We have A. I want to see that is hilarious. Was that a valuable print before of $40,000? So why the fuck? Like what did he take a scissor to it?

Speaker 3:          01:20:20       I'm not sure.

Speaker 1:          01:20:23       Oh, here it is. So I, I personally think that that was intentional. How it stopped right there. It's kind of still beautiful. It is very beautiful. So what it was is, I mean, he wasn't destroying someone's purchased. He was a, it was a little bit of a gift.

Speaker 3:          01:20:40       Everyone freaked out.

Speaker 1:          01:20:42       Definitely ended up as a gift. I mean, the guy who bought it had the option to back out and he was like, fuck, no, I want that. Yeah. It's kind of like by you. You remember Mark Mcgrath? What was that guy's name? The baseball player that like broke the home run record and mark mcgwire Mark Mcguire, market country sugar sugar. Oh yeah, you're right. Sugar, a sugar ray. He, he broke the home run record and uh, the foul ball hit into the stadium. The guy who caught it, Isla sold it for 3 million bucks and then extends. Everyone was on steroids. They kept breaking the record like every year. So it lost all of its value. But this is that foul ball.

Speaker 3:          01:21:24       So a closed down one. Oh, and that. Okay. So here, here, read that

Speaker 1:          01:21:34       today. My art broker.com received this seller and Korea via website from someone who has taken it upon themselves to shred their own grill with blueprint in order to increase its value. They have taken a piece of art, earthly rough worth the 40,000 pounds and in our opinion, made its value one. Come on. That's so stupid. Why would you?

Speaker 3:          01:21:55       Uh, I don't think there's pictures of it. They, I don't think they even want to give that guy any attention.

Speaker 1:          01:22:01       That's crazy to actually take a genuine piece of art, valuable art and just be like, oh, I'm going to fucking cut it up now. Like that's not how it works.

Speaker 3:          01:22:09       The seller wanted them to list it as a 80, 80,000 pound and they, this disagreed. Denied. Oh my God,

Speaker 1:          01:22:22       idiot. I bet you someone buys that though. I'll bet I'll bet a dollar on it. It says worth a dollar. I got a dollar. Let's start the bidding. I mean, that piece has history to. It was the idiot who cut up. You know what I'm saying? I love it. We've, we've spent a lot of money on art.

Speaker 3:          01:22:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:22:46       But um, maybe like a couple thousand dollars, which you're basically paying for someone's time and appreciation versus you know, $20,000,000 for a print. I mean, as a big difference. I, I appreciate art that I, that I like and I'll, I'll spend a thousand bucks, a couple thousand bucks, hundred thousand fucking suck. A lot. Depends. Like this Guy Robert, a Xavier has this huge Batman. I love it. It's amazing. I mean that things, I guess worth 100,000, but it's like the size of this whole back. Yeah. You kind of need. He spent like 10,000 hours and like a whole house just for that. But anyway, like there's some stuff like the gold, the diamond skull. What was that sold for? Like 100 million, $400,000,000. How rich and board can you be? A hundred million. You could feed the whole continent of Africa.

Speaker 1:          01:23:53       The non with the skull. They're like, they're like fix homelessness in our city forever. Now I'll take the school, I'll take the school please. They're like cure here. Uh, HIV and AIDS and all of Africa or one diamond skull. I'll take the school, Howard stern had this great bit where he went on the street that the Boston bomber, he was this handsome young, like a Arab kid, the Boston bomber, and there was a lot of girls who are like a talking about how cute he was and so they went on the street with a picture of Howard and a picture of the Boston bomber and the like. Which one would you rather date? And everyone was picking the Boston bomber over at Howard. I love that. So funny. Rather data terrorists than our. I don't think he was by the way, just for the record.

Speaker 1:          01:24:51       Oh God. What was he? I think he was a Chechnyan. I mean he was a Muslim. He wasn't an Arab. Correct. Okay. My bad. I stand corrected. I want to stand at my pulpit. I want to say I am. I apologize to all of my Arab brothers out there who have been offended in this unfortunate mischaracterization. Not all, not all Arabs are terrorists, and that was not what I meant to imply by any means of any stretch of imagination. He was a Muslim young man of Chechnyan descent, which I believe is. Where's that Dan? It's a region in southern Russia and it's sort of an ongoing as it's been. Great. Thank you. Thank you very much, Dan, for the clarification. And uh, please forgive me please. And if you think that you need to write an essay about my mistake here today and expose me, please you have my permission.

Speaker 1:          01:25:41       I made a grave error of judgment and I give full permission to make a 30 minute essay about it as is entirely warranted. So apologies to everyone for that. And a shout out to, to the SAS right now, a grease bands, obese tourists from writing on donkeys. I love. It's fucking hilarious. Here's our fat lady on a donkey. Greece has banned fat tourists from riding on donkeys after campaigners. So the animals were being left with spinal injuries. Listen, this isn't a century named grace. We've been there. It's a tiny little. I never once had the urge to write a dog. It's not really even like a donkey friendly. No, I don't really get that. Um, Australia, if you look, if you're fat, you got to give up some, you've kind of give some things up. If you're a big fucking fatty and you're going to break a donkey's back than mean, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       Like there was a Nathan for you about the people on horses and he had to put like weather balloons on him and shit. Look, don't have. What's the weight limit? How do they, how do they define fat? Because it just says fat. Let's see how they define it. The, this, these state, a donkey giving tours. Rides and salary should not carry any load is heavier than 100 kilograms. What does that convert to see sound like a lot. Two hundred and 20 pounds. So unless you're extremely tall and built, if you're over 2100. Wait, what? Yeah, that's not a bad. I too fat.

Speaker 1:          01:27:36       I'm like at one 95. That's pretty close. Yo. I'm too fat for a donkey. What the fuck? Why do you need to ride a donkey? A beast of burden is that now I just did a complete one. 80 was writing these donkeys. A little children. Yeah. I had a couple of hamburgers in my life, but am I too fat to ride a donkey? I don't think so. They're just a little donkeys though. They're not horses. They're just trying to save them going down the stairs so he can do the stairs. Do some exercise. No, I need a donkey. Ride the fucking kill this donkey because I'm so fat. I'm going to break its back. Look down more. You can see the stairs down more. More. Oh God. You poor people taking the incognito fat people on donkeys. They blurted, but a tiny bit. You can still see that guy knows who he is. God. He's not even enjoying himself. That donkey will never have another passenger and you're not even enjoying yourself. That dog is going to be put to sleep after this and you're not even enjoying yourself. Wait, this says, yeah. One hundred kilograms will gotta cut him. There's more. You can go that down yourself. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:29:05       Wait. We did do a donkey ride. No, we didn't in center in it. Then we'd go up with donkeys on those stairs are my fucking tripping balls. No donkey rides. Maybe I'm thinking of something else. How did we get up to the hotel by car? Like a same. Yeah, we had a car. It's a normal place to take a donkey. Those poor donkeys, man. God Damn poor motherfuckers fucked up life. Just falling fat. Americans up and down a hill. I love this store though. So point.

Speaker 4:          01:29:55       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:29:57       Incredible stuff, man. Sixty minutes really stepped up. Their game. Dog is a mayor. Oh, we've got these fans submissions, but it's already been two hours or hour and a half short. Wrap it up. We could save it for next time. This one's too funny. I'm going to do this one on my hand at guys. Send your questions. Comments, uh, essays, video suggestions to podcasts at [inaudible] productions.com. I love it. Um, this one was so funny from Joey Lewis. He says, Hey Ethan. Isla, I listened to you're at number 87 podcasts where you mentioned how semen can clog up the drain. This was relevant to me because the freshmen housing at my school, thank God I don't live there. Ken, Ken's Shaw State, they had to remove and replace the plumbing for one of the buildings, the whole entire building due to the buildup of semen tangling with air. There is a photo of the notice that the university housing put up to reminds just not to jerk off in the shower.

Speaker 1:          01:30:56       When you said there is a photo. I almost. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I have the same fear. If you're not jerking off in the shower, where are you jerking off, but it's a communal shower. You've got to jerk off responsibly. Patrice O'neil had the Chris joke. Every says, I jerked off in the shower so many times. I'm surprised a little baby hasn't crawled out your residence. We have recently found several blockages in plumbing system in university village sweets mostly caused by human hair. Let me set my water. However, over the last month, we have found many of these blockages to be caused by large quantities of what we have now determined to be semen. This is intolerable because semen is not soluble in water. It gets caught and filters and our sis system and particularly susceptible. This issue has cost the university thousands of dollars to repair this far.

Speaker 1:          01:31:48       Thank God, good thing you collect a lot of tuition since stopped complaining. It's warm out my semen, though we know that though we know that you must take care of your business. We have never faced a situation of this enormity before. It is because of this. Unfortunately, that we must ask you to refrain from masturbating in the shower. May we those who wished to masturbate, do so in the comfort of their own bedroom and dispose of their discharge appropriately. I bet you 90 percent of the dudes continue to jack off in the shop. I knew, and yet unlike [inaudible] no signature though, this guy should frame it. No signature,

Speaker 4:          01:32:29       Joey.

Speaker 1:          01:32:32       That's the tough thing how you can't guarantee that. It's like you gotta stop me. I'm jerking off in the shower that God intended. That's why school is so expensive, so the fucking demon. That's fine. I had a communal shower and college boy. It was cold sexual boys and girls shared the same bathroom. Yeah, I know it was progressive Santa Cruz, but there was all the. So you would come out with a towel? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There wasn't naked people. Yeah. Yeah. But like there's like four showers, stalls next to each other with like a curtain and private stall. But yeah, it was a cold wet, but there was, you could. There was semen on the floor sometimes guys. Yeah. There was a bathtub in there by the way. Then nobody, you. But God forbid you were in the military. Wasn't a coed there. Are you fucking kidding?

Speaker 1:          01:33:31       Co? Everything I know about the military is from starship troopers, so I don't know it. It's the females. We had our own like little area and the mail having their own area. Even the Western Wall is separated and they're fucking fully clothed that the US military is and coed. Like I said, starship troopers are eight. Dan, I'll never forget that scene and I saw some titties that I didn't expect that I still have a shower and I was like, what the fuck? Because I ended up, I was like 13, so if somebody like looked at me, pop a boner and it's like, how do they shower with her and they don't all have fat boners right now. Remember when you're 13 and like you tend, you hit a speed bump on the bus a little too fast. You pop a boner, tuck it under the belt, you get really good at the uh, the Bass, uh, the backpack masking method. Yeah. Was checking something in your backpack? I tucked it under the belt most of the time, but sometimes because you have to kind of maneuver for that. And Yeah, a lot of tucking and grabbing. So the backpack is definitely a god send.

Speaker 1:          01:35:00       It's one of the two options. I don't think there's anything else. Is there anything else in or Zach, is there another way that you guys concealed boners rarely ever get them at school, but as soon as I got home and was like sitting on the toilet when I was 13, that was it. What, what? You pop a bony on the toilet because it's like your space, like do your business jerk off. Yeah. This is what I'm saying. You didn't read the question. Where else have you mentioned to me that. So you would shit and jerk off? Uh, yes sir.

Speaker 4:          01:35:42       Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:35:48       Would you check off after you shit? Uh, yeah. Well it really depends how big the shape is. Shit, while jerking off. Always separate. I don't know if that's possible, but you know, like it was either one before the other. So you sit there still do flush the bulb before he check off. Like you said over the shit. I can't jerk off on this shit and the flush and then you've still stinks. Probably though have like a smell. I smell my own farts. I'm a minute. I love it. I love it. Love it. Love it. Yeah. You wouldn't admit it. You don't like to smell your own parts? Not even a little bit. You're not intrigued. No. You're not intrigued. Not intrigued. At least interested. Interested in what? The smell. No, fucking liar.

Speaker 1:          01:36:49       That's like a biological fact that people liked the smell, their own fars like, like they enjoy. I think so you'd think Dan, do you like the smell it? I'm sorry. I can't. Sorry, you started by saying it's a fact and then you finished with. I think so. I was. I think this is another debate. I think people like the smell, but I will. I will give you that. Kind of tolerate it for sure. For sure. I her, I swear to God. You smell it and enjoy it. You, Dave, you breathe deeply on it. You're just doing a movie. I am not. I liked the small amount of parks. There's a lot of people out there that said, I agree. So this is another one of these things mean to explore. I'm being genuine by the way. I'm serious. Why would I admit to that? But like why would I lie about liking the spelman being controversial? I'm not eva wants desperately, not the believer. This is what I'm hearing.

Speaker 1:          01:37:58       Um, there was another one somebody asked, um, and the spirit of all these conversations id zed, zed zed slur asked, I was always convinced everyone picks their nose picking her nose, ventilates it effectively and enables you to breathe much easier for the more scraping, a nice dry chunk of snot out of your nose is the best feeling ever. To me it seems like a basic human necessity. But maybe those are just my own habits. Ever since you started these types of conversation on your podcast, I started doubting my judgment on what's normal and what is not more and more. So. Do you pick your nose? If so, which finger do use also? I'm pretty sure there are people who even eat their burger. I'm not sure whether it is only kids or adults to personally. I always found it gross so I never did. Do you? So, um, we're discussing taboo. We're breaking apart tonight on 60 minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:39:00       I think everyone picks their nose, but there's certain levels to it. Like if I'm in the shower, like I find it gross. So if I'm in the shower, that's a good place to pick my nose, but generally I'll try to use a tissue or something just because I don't. I just think it's kind of gross personally. But I think everyone picks their nose. I tell you what's grocer that I've seen people do. I guess you're just walking with somebody on the street and just out a nowhere without saying anything. Oh my fucking. The worst is the worst. You're just having a conversation and make conversation. Should Sean Balog does that?

Speaker 1:          01:39:39       I'm like, what the fuck are you calling? Whatever. He doesn't care. And then they won't come out. So they'll go on the street with shredder the other day and someone just walking across the street from me and they go, why would you do that in sight of another human being a lunatic. Some people think that's normal. That's fucking wild. Shit. Shit's crazy. So picking the nose, I think. I agree. Eating boogers is fucked up. If you're under the age of eight, you need to plug in. Can Weirdo over. But yeah, actually, you know what? I shouldn't say I don't want to. I never did it as my personal preference. I seen some friends where I look over and they're like trying to like low key. They're bugs when I was. Now I know people do that. I don't want to shame booger eaters because we're.

Speaker 1:          01:40:47       We're getting out there, we're putting it all out there. So I think I do think there's a large percentage of adults eat their burgers and secret. The idea to me is frankly repulsive. Why? I don't think Zachary fee and then anything is possible. People like it. I don't know. It's like smelling your own far to me. That makes sense. But eating a burger makes me want to fucking die. He enter. Zach, I have to ask for posterity. Do any of you guys pick your nose or eat your books? I would rather lick dog poop. Then wonder what about your own Burger? Absolutely not disgusting. No, never year and it's his own books only gets the skepticism came into dry too fast. So anyway, that was interesting conversation. I'm just. That's about it. I know about dog becomes mares. That's something interesting or no dog became a mayor.

Speaker 1:          01:41:47       That's it. There you go. That's just what, you know, there's this whole story about a dog is getting reelected as mayor and what it made me think about is what does this say about the job, mayor? I stopped the bullying the video. Say like you did good. Like what does that mean? He's a good boy. Being the mayors of serious job. Like you get paid like you have responsibilities. Like what does this say about all government job? I think it was the mayor of La is a serious job. Yeah. Yeah. But uh, I think in, in smaller towns, the mayor is like a ceremonial thing, like the city council really run shit. And then the mayor, I know this completely from parks and rec. So take this all with everything I know is based off your shows and the movies, all the knowledge question. Um, and they're, you know what they're said it cost a dollar to vote for the mayor.

Speaker 1:          01:42:40       I was like, well, let's wait. Really? No. Or to run human know about dollar volt. Probably not that serious of an election. Then it costs to vote. That's what I recall from the video. We're not going to watch. All right. That's enough of this. Thank you everyone who watched. Thank you everyone who listened. Thank you everyone who enjoyed. I hope you're having a blessed at Friday. Hope you have a blessed weekend. Thank you to everyone who's taking notes diligently right now to cast their essay on a Swedish reproductions and how I've changed, which is true. I have changed. And so there's definitely something there. How I've compromised my morals for money. That's a popular one. There's evidence there you can pull from and um, yeah, there's a lot there. So I wish you all the best with your essay and we all look forward to walk.

Speaker 1:          01:43:33       So guys, thank you all. And of course using this clip and be using this club and be like, look how he doesn't take criticism.

We had a whole thing about. We had a whole thing about food. You can eat deli meats.

Speaker 1:          01:44:28       You've got nine months to talk about it. You can't eat deli meats. I was like, if isla can eat deli meats when she was pregnant, we all should not be eating delegates. That's freaky. You know what I'm saying? But that's not how it works. It's not just. It's sensitive to the. To the little. The little people have a baby that it is right now. Boucher songs almost over. Oh, we better go. All right guys, thank you all for watching.
