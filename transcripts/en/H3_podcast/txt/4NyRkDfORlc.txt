Is that your, have you played that venue before?

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       Yeah, one of the time. Uh, I forget one. Uh, 2015 I played it. Mm. So now back. And uh, hopefully just as good, if not better than the last time.

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       How does it feel? Cause that there's like almost 21,000 seats. None. How does it feel playing to that many people? Verse like 200 People in Comedy Club? It depends on how see

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       it like, so when I did it, I had the stage onto one side, but now this time I'm doing it in the round so it's more seats. I don't know how, I don't know how many it is, but uh, it's, you know, what I did the first time was I ended up, um, you know, cause I'm a big Zeplin fan and a song remains the same. You know, the concert film was shot there, so I played drums. So me and the guys from the Goddamn comedy jam, Josh, Adam Meyers and all those guys, Ben Bailey came down, my publicist played drums. We all just in the ld arena just jammed and all these guns and roses and rock songs that we grew up with. Then it was fun. It turned it into like sort of like a, um, it felt like a more like, uh, like, uh, you know, our clubhouse for the day.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       And uh, yeah, you went in, you made a lot of noise and then it didn't, it didn't seem as crazy. So I went out there and Paul versey opened and then Joe Derosa was on, Joe had this old sort of what I was calling it, a golden girl's sweater on. So I w I just made fun of that, you know, keep going, you know, Paul Verhoeven and Joe to rose with his fucking golden girls sweater. Just made me feel like I was at a comedy club, you know? Hmm. And then I had nervous fan at first show. I was like, that's still, you know, like, I mean I get more like I want people to feel like they got their money's worth. Like I want people to leave. Like you feel like, uh, like nervousness and all that is, is on the way up. And then once you get to a certain level, then it becomes like responsibility.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       Like these people spent their hard earned money coming out. Yeah. To get a sitter and it's not like they just went to a comedy club, hey, let's watch 10 comics and maybe a couple of drinks. Yeah, I have a couple of, yeah, this is like, this is an event. So now the pressure in that, uh, no, I mean, I mean it's, it would be a lot of pressure if I had to do like math, like something I wasn't good at, but it's like, this is what I do. They're coming to see me. I mean, you could do a podcast there. No, no, you'd be fine. Well, I guess you're not in front of a crowd, but whatever, you know what I mean? If you went to the, to whatever comic con podcasting, would you be nervous? Yes. All right. Well [inaudible] nervous. Got, I'm so neurotic.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       I am nervous. I'm nervous right now. Okay. Very nervous. I don't think about that and help build trust. I'm well, I'm on the edge. Was there a relaxed thank you God. Okay. Keep it together. Was there a point when you kind of pick a, certainly you felt nervousness sometime? Oh No. Yeah, the first eight years of my career, I mean I would be like, I'd do a 10 minute spot and then on nights where it was a difficult crowd in New York, I would be out of breath and sweating really 12 minutes. I was telling jokes and it would be sweaty show. Yeah, no, no, no, no. I had on, I had all these rituals. I this referral for years where before I went on stage I would untie and then retire my shoes cause I always worried what if they came on time and I did a face plant.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       Oh wait, I have, should have that kind of OCD shit. It drives me crazy. I don't know if that's OCD, but, well, I depends on what your childhood was. I mean, if you had a childhood and you weren't bullied at all and you still think like that, I would think it was some sort of ocd, but you know, he got kicked out of yours for a while ago. So city you're kind of looking at, oh, your Z. I don't know. I'm not going to diagnose you. I have no idea. Yeah. So in my case it was probably just, you know, my childhood or whatever and it's just like, oh, you got bullied as a kid. Yeah. Oh, both. I did bully I, you know, it was, yeah, get it off of me and I'd pick on somebody weaker than me. You know, it was the Lord of the flies back then.

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       So it wasn't the way it is now where, um, you know, you can go on Youtube and the next thing you know, the bullies crying for some reason. Like, I feel like bullies almost important in a way, isn't it? Like you got to allow kids to give each other shit in a sense. I mean you can't call it a kids too much. I don't think as a parent you ever allow it? Sure. You know it's, it's something though. But I mean I know that there's like a, like I have a daughter, I want her to take some mma and I, I just think all women should know that because I feel like rapists, you know, depending on how well they're in doubt, at some point they're going to have to get in close. And I feel like no one killer. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's like, I would think like when you watch those women fighting in the UFC, it's just like this, I mean this probably, I mean I would think what I have, what percentage of the population of just guys that even know how to fight sure could beat them and like I don't think they could because the second you get close to him and he's a professional level fighters, so if I'm, the average woman would learn that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       I mean, you could get them in a triangle. The arms are, when I said the armed guard, I'm trying to remember all this stuff. Rogan says like, I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm not educated in it, but I just know looking at it that you just like learn a little self defense just enough that you can be on your back and be in a powerful position. And I just figured like a guy's going to try to gorillas weigh in and try to hold you down or whatever. And then all of a sudden he's, you know, he's tapping out, you blow out his elbow and, and that's an erection killer right there, man. You blow up the elbow as it, I think that's slang for the arm bar.

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       See yet that's part of, I feel like that's a new thing. You're already worried about your daughter being sexually assaulted. You know, how old is your daughter? I don't think that is, I think that's you projecting your ocd on me. It's all we you're talking about, you know, you want your, your two year old daughter to get Krav mcgraw so she could knife a dude's neck. Yeah. But I mean it's like, it's not like, you know, that didn't exist. It was like sexual assault started in 2014. I mean like, stuff like that is about what has always happened and uh, and then also, you know, it gives you like confidence and it really is all you gotta do. You know, there was elementary, middle, and in high school and you know, I feel like somewhere in junior high you just had to have one fight and fight back and then it was like prison and was like, oh, I don't, you know, he's going to be a problem.

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       And then they would just move on. And then the kids who never fought back, um, it's, it's, they just have these horrible variances. Um, so I dunno, I just, you know, it's just one of those things, you know, as a parent, I guess what I meant is like, now that you're a parent, you thinking about things differently possibly and with kids and with your daughter, I mean, how has that changed? I would say I am applying the things I always thought about because I, I've, because for all these years of not being a parent, I would watch parents, you know, dressing their kids in certain ways and I would just be like, how do you not see that? That is that the shit that that kid's gonna get, get it right. You know what I mean? And it's just like for the love of God, can you give them a fighting chance?

Speaker 1:          00:08:31       Yeah. So like, um, yeah, I, I, I, I think you, you, when you grow up, you become one and you either completely forget your childhood or you have a pretty vivid, hmm. Murray of it and I, you know, it's most, most of my channel is positive. That's an interesting observation. Yeah. I feel like I forgot most of it. That means it probably had a decent one. Right. Or the good ones, the one you forget. No, no, because I had, I had no good in a bit. I don't know. I don't, I don't know what though. I'm not a psychologist, but I just think like the people I've talked to, they either like remember everything or it's just like, dude, that was a long time ago, man, I don't remember. So I think if you don't remember and then you have a kid, you know, I wouldn't want, I would rather be the kid and the parent that remembers. Right. So how do you forget my mother said the forties actually was kind of heartbreaking. We don't, my daughter is only a year and a half and she was going, I just really enjoy these first three, four years as she got, she goes really enjoying before they go to school and you know the kids ruin them.

Speaker 1:          00:09:33       Like wow. That's like one of the funniest and saddest things you ever said button. And then I was thinking like, why did she think I was ruined? And I probably was on some level. That's an interesting that she remembered that after all these years. Well because he came home from school ruined. Yeah. But just going to send your kids to school with, with people who have kids that they're not actively involved in their life. And so then the kids acting out and there they, the kids on his way to becoming a problem and then your kid sees that behavior starts to mimic it. Like I, you know, a lot of my friends obviously have kids that are older and they just, Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Like it's just kids that are just, uh, you know, the key is not to get mad at the kid. You got to get mad at the parents know if you ever want to punch the kid, you don't do that. Right. Don't punch the parent. Punched the, when dog I, I'll give you a tee shirt. I just got that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       But yeah, I mean I say we dogs now because we have a dog and we go to a dog park a lot and things like that. And like it's always the owner. The owner is not always, but sometimes, yeah, sometimes. But I mean, I dunno because dogs, I feel like there's this pure sweet souls for the most part. And they have to be fucked up kind of by the owner to be really or dangerous animals. There's the dogs that nature says no to, but people say yes to because it's adorable. And then you like the mother just, there's an inherently knows that there's something fucked up with the dog, kicks it away and the thing's going to starve to death. And that's too heartbreaking as a human being in a dog lover to watch. Okay, so you give it the bottle and like, you know, then one day you see it's got one red eye and the other he got the terminator.

Speaker 1:          00:11:07       Well, you're talking about like an adopted dog or like a getting a puppy because I feel like when you adopted dog, you definitely throw the dice a little bit, you know? Um, I had a rescue dog so that, that was the other pit bull that was my experience yet. And we ended up having to find her a new home. And fortunately it worked out, but she was a human aggressive as they say. I spent thousands of dollars trainers and all this types of things like my trainer. And it ended up taking her and it has been like the challenge, I think of his dog curry. One of the trainer adopted the dog. Yeah. It took incredible. Yeah. Yeah. Has He, Ted's, he managed to tame the animal. Now he's been working with her for two years and she, she's a, for the first time in her life, has another dog friend.

Speaker 1:          00:11:52       But he was the one who said, you know, this is one of these dogs. Nature said no to, but people said yes. He goes, I'm thinking that that's what it is. But she's an absolute, she's one of those people, like if she was just abandoned again and then came in here and then met the three of us once, she'd be all timid. And once she saw that we were cool and we're going to, once you fed her and protecting her, she loved you and she almost love to hard. Right, right. So then, and then she would treat everybody else who came through that door. Yeah. Like they were an ax murderer and we would just never, I mean, so I had all these things I used to, uh, one of my buddies, a forest, we used to just go on hikes and it took forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       But he was really good with animals and she ended up accepting him and it was the longest, you know, and I had to do all like come back to the house and just, just have him, you know, stop at the gate. And then it was a little bit behind the gate and then up to the front door. And then, and then there was all the, him walking in first and just any little thing could cause like a setback. And it was, uh, it was, you know, it was emotionally draining. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, she ended up buying one of my friends. I always keep thinking of that Mama and she raced Adam. There was a pocket, I should have kicked it because he was so, she was on like a hardwood floor. I went and knocked her down, you know, he would've been just fine.

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       Was he her? No, she barely, cause she hadn't done that before so she didn't, but, but how it works is at first they go to the feet, then they go higher and each time as they build up and then it's fight and then grab it. And it just, you know, it's sort of like an escalating like alcoholic. Um, I mean I'm talking kind of, you know, I don't really know a lot of this stuff and there'd be a bunch of people right now. So I'm just talking about what my experience was. I'm not saying I know everything about dogs, so, but that's, that's kind of I was afraid to adopt because you just never know what you're going to get. And people give a shit. Cause we bought, we bought a dog. We wanted, we wanted a purebred puppy or not a pure bed, but we really liked the Maltese and the Yorkies.

Speaker 1:          00:13:54       We have a friend who had to military, so, and we really liked them, so we were like, so we've got a file. Can got a falcon. That's the only thing. Multisite. No. Oh it was a maltese. Just a little fluffy white dog. Oh, it's a little toy dog that you can pet, but we get so much shit for having bought a dog, but it's like, you know, you throw the dice when you, you don't know what these dogs at the pound has been through. You know, it's like, uh, I mean, were you supposed to do just what was supposed to have a puppy mill ones? These dogs need to be a Bot. Somebody's got to take care of these dogs. I mean, you need to, you need to know what you're doing when you can get a rescue to train them. Right? I mean, I don't, yeah, for me, for me it's my first dog, so I don't want to gamble too my chin.

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       But it's because it feels like you, like when you're walking down the street with him and people be like, Oh, where'd you get him? And you didn't buy that dog. You, it's like, if you care that much, sorry, this is something that bothers me. If you care that much about adopting dogs, how can you have a kid? You got to adopt kid, right? There's kids out there that need a home. How dare you have a kid of your own if you're not going to adopt first heard, same logic. It's basically a puppy mill. Yeah, I agree with that. Thanks. I got, I got bills and toys to map. My theory has been, if I was in your situation, I would just annoy the shit out of people. I would call volunteer it. Well, I got an a thought. If you're a Brit mean. Yeah, it was like the least sick we looking one.

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       Yeah, I figured I'd get that one. Yeah, I love that. Yeah, you just steer into it. I love that. I need, that's why I was, I was over in France and like I'm trying to learn how to speak French. I have been bad with it, but like when I would go over there, you know, if you stink, they just start speaking English. And I was just like, well, if I get to listen to the English, you're listening to my French and I would just torture him with it and I would not switch over. And it'd be like, I speak English and I speak French. I speak French. Okay. This is the situation or the smart way to do it. That's the way to learn. Yeah. What else am I going to learn? You know, I lived in Israel with Isla for five years and I succumbed because every time, you know, they're like, oh, this idiot American, I'm gonna speak English to them.

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       And I succumbed, I didn't steer in. I wish I steered it. You got to, you got to get into the comedy of it. Just fortunately them with their own language. It's really funny. They maybe look at immigrants differently, like, uh, but I guess it immigrants, it's worse. It's worse because they're actually staying, you know what I mean? So I would be like, I would be like the fact that I'm going to be there for 10 days. I'm not trying to get employed, kind of give a fuck and I just have a good time. Um, I don't know. I had a great time at a great time doing that. I need to get a shirt that says I bought this dog. Yeah. So you probably never spent much time at a dog park because there's a whole thing there, but it sounds like your dog would have just gone on a rampage there.

Speaker 1:          00:16:48       Probably she was all right initially, but then once she sort of bonded with us, then it became a problem. So no, we stay, I stayed away from there and then, then everybody else who watches like the dog whisperer in that and then they tried to be the guy running the shirtless up. Yeah, everybody does it. They didn't even know what it is. See if you would've stayed through that. I did that for a while. Like the magic was making that noise and it's just like, no, this guy's been working Walcott ever. Does he even know anything? I also wonder does he just pretend like he knows and then we believe him. You know what I mean? I don't know. I mean you're right. You're really, I mean he's doing this. I mean how much, what does that do? Well I think the guy knows what he's doing. Okay. He got a TV show. There's people he did, but he worked with a lot of famous people's dogs. No famous people got eaten by dogs. So I would say some level nuts. Yeah. Yeah. You're really cynical guide man.

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       That is a lot for me to say that I'm cynical either the bill birth yet, but you're not, you know what you're not, it's going to close. People think like I listen to your podcasts a lot and you are, you're a very optimistic, fair guy. There's like a real fairness behind everything you say. It's nice to be listened to every once everybody else go. Like you know, he's the king. I'll rage common. I think cap guns. Cause you know, I used to be a redhead before it left me, but I still have the red beard. There's just something about like, you can sort of openly say that redheads or the child, children of Satan and that's, that's totally fell all good. It's all good. Kick of Ginger Day. All that fucking that bother you though. Like for real, all the data and does it, it just, it, it's freeing because then I don't have to care about whatever you're crying about.

Speaker 1:          00:18:24       And particularly white women complaining about how difficult it is to live in the United States of America. This is hilarious. You know what I mean? I mean look, if you some hillbilly living on a dirt trail then yeah. Okay. I would feel bad for you. But like other than that, you have, you have, you know, pretty much having red hair. No, no. It's, it's just more like, uh, not have red hair thing is, it's a myth dude. I did great too when I was single. I did great. No, it was confident. I was funny girls. I did fine. But this whole fucking thing that I was like over, over the corner, um, I mean it's suck when I was growing up. Yeah, definitely. Cause it's like you got a bullseye on top of your head. So, but I feel like I, you know, I always joke with people, if I had like brown hair, I wouldn't even be in this fucking business.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       That's great. I don't think it would be funny and I think I wouldn't be be, you know, just doing some big cog in a wheel somewhere then a dental, uh, dentist possibly as your father before you write your dental assistant. Yes. That's interesting. Well, I mean it's not that interesting. It's interesting if my dad wasn't a dentist when, right. It's like, well, did you have ever plans, like before you got into comedy, what, at what point did you decide you wanted to get a comedy when you were doing like dental assisting? Or was that just kind of, you always knew you wanted the job? I needed a job and I got fired, uh, from this warehouse because, uh, it was this, this fat guy who was running, she was from the carpeted area. Right. And he used to come out, you know like the typical Douche who could like just gets a little bit of power and it just, I don't know why and then they just go pure evil, pure evil.

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       But he just, he just walked out there like he had accomplished something like, I don't know what like he had like an astronaut sort of gait the way he was walking. So he used to come out there and everybody would seem common and then try to like work it, oh look at me cutting up the box and look at me, you know, doing this shit. And I just met [inaudible]. I was like, fuck this guy. So I wouldn't do that. And if anything I would, I would step off the gas a little bit. But yeah, it was up man. Damn, I didn't do that. What do you get the, where do you like it was self sabotage because I have no other option. I feel like everyone wishes they had that right there where you're like, you know what? Fuck this guy. I'm going to work less.

Speaker 1:          00:20:42       I don't have that in me. That has loved it, but that has to be applied correctly. Right. Cause it'll stop your life. You need to work as a team. There's a plane crash and maybe we should go this way. And I've gone, oh no, it was just cuff sucker lead me out of the woods. But like not fuck everyone. It's fuck these guys that don't deserve my respect. Well, yeah. So I didn't work as hard and then I, and I was due for raise it and then I asked for a raise and then magically I got laid off and the economy was bad and I couldn't get a job. And uh, I needed, one of my dad was like, well why don't you come work with me for a little bit? And I did and it, and it was, it was great cause I got, I got, I worked with him for five years and it went wow.

Speaker 1:          00:21:23       And I got to a sort of, you know, by not seeing my dad, just seeing him as a dentist, like I kind of got to figure him out, um, and understand them more. So it was a great thing. And then also I learned so much about, you know, teeth and all of the headaches that he can cause uh, yeah, I don't think I'd still take x rays because they switched up the machinery so long go since when I did it. But I could still take impressions, pour 'em up. I still don't have the old school way. We tap on that vibrating thing to get all the apples out of it. It's nothing worse than if there was a fall because the bubble would, they always seem to go down to the bottom. So it then another one would always be right where the tooth was and then like the bubble wouldn't take the w would kill that impression.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       Uh, that part of it. And you'd have to talk about when you put like the clay in someone's mouth. Yeah. And then you can't just report because the, the, the, that gunk shrinks and then you have to Redo it. And then if you had a gagger and you had to read it, and I will fucking guy I puked at the dentist when they took her. Yeah. I was a gagger man. Broke my heart. One of those bubbles popped in my mold. Yeah. There was just like, I used to just, what are the kinds of crazy shit you deal as a, you ever getting people's mouths or were you just on Stan? Yeah, it took out the stitches and that was certified to take x rays and uh, yeah, it was about the extent of it. So when did that, and then did an end when you started doing comedy?

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       No, I was doing, I was doing dates and I was, and it was hilarious. My Dad, you know, back then he had like, he worked from seven to seven. I never saw anybody. We had a 7:00 AM patient used to work on like, like prisoners, people in the correctional thing, cops. He would work out. Yeah. He like, he was like a force of nature. Like he did the work of three dentists. So I wanted to work with the other dentists because it was just like I could actually get a lunch. We used to police to numb people up. I'd be numb people up and then race out while they were getting numb. And just wolf down slice of pizza. Oh, you'd be on your feet. The whole day is just like, no, I got my work ethic. Both my parents worked extremely hard their whole lives. I mean, they're older now, so they're retired and stuff, but like, uh, but just watching how hard they worked and I think that that is one of the main reasons why I got this gig coming up in New York was, um, you know, it was a combination of, of learning. That's what working is. And then coming up in the Boston comedy scene where like what was considered killing there.

Speaker 3:          00:23:56       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       You know, what was considered just getting the job done was killing and some of these other cities that I went to, but like they're, so it was just laying in grounds. Yeah, no, they murdered, it was a guy, Kevin Knox, rest his soul. He used to host the show and uh, patrice rest his soul. He used to say, uh, Kevin doesn't host a show as much as he just like, takes breaks from killing. So he would like murder and then you would, and we used to compare it to like a giant wave. You'd get up there and just find a ride. And he really took it personally, if you bombed on his show because he felt like the crowd looked at him like, Kev, you fucked us. Like who was like, like he took it personally responsible. Like he was the GM putting together a championship team.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       So, and we used to tell horror stories about having to follow, which you have to follow with star trek bid or is drunk driving bid. And they were just all, they all murdered. And um, so yeah, it was probably, you know, that whole thing. So I have a very low level of patience for people that dog it at their jobs. And I don't give a fuck if you hate your job, just going in there and just not doing a good job. It's just like, I just, just like then Quinn, but like don't make everybody else around you suffer. Like it's, it's Kinda like, it's bullshit. Like you signed up to do this job, do the fucking job. And, um, and I really don't have any sympathy for people who don't work hard and, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:25:22       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:22       You know, and they're not getting where they want to be in life. If you're making an effort and you're still getting fucked and that's like somebody, I'll try to help out. But like if you're just like

Speaker 2:          00:25:30       not putting in every minute

Speaker 1:          00:25:31       yeah. You're fucking over the person you're currently working for and then ask him like where your brass ring is. It's like, well, I mean, that's not how the world works.

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       What, what is the C, you've probably heard this a lot. People say that dentists are like high rate of suicide. What is, is there something to that? Have you heard that?

Speaker 3:          00:25:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:50       Uh, yeah, I think everybody heard that growing up, but I never knew when that true. I've never known one that killed him.

Speaker 2:          00:25:56       Yeah. Did you, well, it sounds like it was stressful, but not suicidal. Yeah, obviously. Yeah. He never killed him yet. He's, he's, if that's what you're asking to kill themselves, it's just the oprah part. Where you going to try to get me to cry? Yeah. Well, I got nothing done about it one night. I just thought that was interesting thing. It's just one of those things you hear and you're just like accepted it on face value. You're like, oh yeah, dentists, they're all killing themselves. Yeah. That was all of those things. And that was the thing. The guy who put the pack of firecrackers in the kids back pocket and lit it and blew half his ass off. And you never heard that one, that these might be older ones before your guys' time. But there was a, there was these think candies called pop rocks.

Speaker 2:          00:26:35       Oh yeah, I know the pop box. So the thing was somebody swelled a whole bag and his stomach exploded and he died. Like all of those types of things existed. So I don't know what the new ones are. Right. He was on his ipad and he fell asleep and he burned his face trying to update the technology. That's a good one. I think that's true actually.

Speaker 2:          00:33:36       We are back with the great, great, greatest bilborough. I do mean that, but I know it makes you uncomfortable, but one great was bad enough. Does it bite you? But you know that I like being appreciated. Yeah. Okay. Just say Tony, that one with the person I appreciate. Oh really? Yes. Back what? He's worth the money. Okay. It's definitely worth the money guys. Madison Square Garden. Yeah. What was that? A November 7th and New York City guys. Head on over to bill bird.com/events and I do want to say, guys, you all have netflix. I mean, everyone has netflix. Statistically half of Americans maybe even more have netflix. That's incredible, right? That means that everybody should be watching. Episode fabric is for family saving. More people have it considering how easy it is to steal somebody's right password. So I would say probably they don't care about that. That blows my mind.

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       I mean I think that's like this, this gi level loss like it's, yeah, but then we'll get them addicted to it someday. Someday that relationships fail and they're only going to be halfway through narcos and they can have to see the ending and then we'll get their account. But like they were so ahead of the game because all these companies with passwords with access, there are so tight ass about it. They'd be like, Oh, you can only log in to computers that wants netflix going back a decade said no. Everyone on the block, everybody, you know can use your account and look at them now. Who's fucking laughing? No, I guess they are. F is for family guys. Check it out and left. And now I'm uh, I want to show you some videos. Okay. I thought I would like, I don't know if you're going to like this one. This one, I don't know. Save. It was risky but risky. I don't know. We'll see what you think. This is the old classic. You may have seen it. You don't have to say anything. I just want you to enjoy it.

Speaker 4:          00:35:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:35       Is that a move? You know this is

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       us. Check us out. That was incredible. You want to do that again? That was like break dancing right there. No, that's a move. That is absolutely his face got kind of probably kind of roughed up. I think that's absolutely a move. They face grind. Watch him watch. I'll control the is, I don't know dude. [inaudible] second you slide on your face. You don't want to be, your arms are going to flail. He was just like, well they have a different center about hockey snap. Like if it's a move then that's all we knew is just watch his arms. Watch his arms. He was pushing to to try to get another, I mean is the foot that they're ahead of the game. All right guys, I want to see more of those. Well, I've never thought about it as it being a movie once again. Great, great.

Speaker 1:          00:36:23       Mine is. I appreciate it very much. That's just and move both the baseline. So here I want to ask how nuts to the crowd go when he did that. I mean it's still, we got to the gate. What are you going to go right? I got plenty of little people are and what are you going to go there? I got what you're finishing. Why the face slide, the face, whatever you want to call it. The Deli face. Yeah, exactly. So I want to ask you about one of the great moments in your career or one of my favorite moments in your career. And then I, I've always appreciated only with pop this up for reference for us, the audience I want to ask you about Sherry's berries, it ketchup going up and it's sweet holiday gift. So you had a, I'm just going to catch on one up.

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       You had a advertiser called Sherry's berries and while you were reading the copy you just, you couldn't hold it together because it was the first time reading the copy. It was just so homophobic and homoerotic if the same time that I just, it was, it was so silly, I couldn't move. It was actual cop and it's just so ridiculous. The it like I've never heard anything like that being advertised. Evidently they're delicious. Still still make hot chocolate. Yeah. And they dropped me after awhile. You know what happened was I had Harris Stanton was on and they was like, we have strawberries, you know, drip, you know, dunked in white chocolate and then they've, we have, you know, in dark chocolates like oil. And I've just jokingly said to him, he's black. I said, how come the white chocolate comes before this and that? Then we started riffing on the Klan or something and then, I dunno, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       Then it was just two people can fit it off. Strawberries are made by the clan. I didn't know what they was saying. Yeah. I'm still sad they left. I loved going share. Yeah. I mean Dude, how many ads go viral? I've been thinking about, I've never bought cherries, berries. They told me to take this down and then cause I, in the end I said, you guys better buy this shit cause I'm gonna get in trouble. And then people bought it and then they quickly were smart enough to be like, okay, leave it up, leave it up. And we had this really cool thing where I felt like cherries, beer, they get me, we won't happen if somebody new came in or maybe somebody saw black klansman. Mm. The, the original cut of it. Right. You know, before it came out. Now I don't know what happened. What do you love? Or maybe I'm gonna say we listened to it so many times. It's like one of our, oh thank you. I love, so let me, let me update the, the audience here with a little Sherry's berries. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:38:51       Well, so have delicious products such as Christmas cake pops, cheese cakes and dip pretzels is the only way to get this special. 1999 Sherry's berries offer call eight six six fruit. I'm sorry, what the fuck am I? So did I have proof of this? This is fucking ridiculous. Who the fuck is going to buy this shit? 100

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       fruit. Yeah. I love that so much. So did they? I W I really just wanted to know how did they react to that. But it sounds like they reacted like you'd have to be like laughing. It's going to take it down. Yeah. And um, well I have this thing on my part. I never talked to the advertisers. I never available. And if like yeah, either get what I do or you don't. And I understand, I understand if you don't want to be associated with her, my stupidity. But if you do, I think I can help you sell some stuff like the bear. Well, the thing is is people can fast forward through the ads so the show can't stop. So you got it. You got to do something to make a one. I like on Howard Stern, I love when he burps during the region. It just, it always makes me laugh and it always sounds like the same one like red stew in it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:20       But I, uh, it always makes me laugh whenever it's just something hilarious about somebody burping while reading advertising. So I actually look forward. I look forward to is reads, I look forward to your reason. I love listening to your reads because, well, let me ask you this. Do, do you get in trouble a lot when you do read, because a lot of your reads or like I was listening to your, one of your recent podcasts, you were talking about sports betting. You're like, I don't like, I don't fucking sports cars. They make you say like [inaudible] on his buds. Like, I don't, I don't do this shit. They'd be like, words in your mouth maybe like you bet you when I'm like, yeah, well you lose and your wife leaves you. There's degrees. So the sponsors get upset with your candidate. No, I think at this point that gets kind of been established.

Speaker 1:          00:41:06       This is what he does. Good stuff. Yeah. So they'll just be like, they like, I haven't lost an Avatar, I shouldn't say this, but I haven't lost one in about three months. Four months. Yeah. So that's been a good run. That's good. That's a good run. Good one. There's always like my favorite wine, which are going to the hall of fame of the One and dones. I'm trying to think who they were. The only one I could ever remember is a box and I thought, I thought, I know what happens. I thought it was nature's box, like the best of it. So I was like, you going down on Mother Nature, right? Yeah. So stupid. As you're laughing, I read another three lines of copy and you're getting information and they just didn't see, they didn't find the humor. We had nature box. I think they went under actually. Yeah, most stupid. They're just like bringing, we weren't, we failed them do it bringing you a banana and it's just like, well, I mean I could fucking, I can't do this yourself. Like what they were offering, it was just like hacks with snacks, snacks, snack. You Take Guinness to 45 seconds out of your day. You can probably do this yourself. You ever get asked for make goods when you do ads?

Speaker 1:          00:42:13       What do you mean? Like, if I screwed, they say, they say you got to do another one for free because you messed up the first one. I don't recall anybody ever talking to me in that tone. They don't fuck it up day. Yeah, you guys, you got to do another, you got it free because a no one's lucky. You still live in fucking punk. Yeah. So let me tell you someone, we get the shit all the time. I don't get this. I don't get that respect. You don't get what? I don't get that respect that people ask me for me. Get again to the Oh no, you'll, you'll get no, I know. There was no, this has been shit that I've screwed up. Um, but I said there's a buffer between me and them, so I love that. So Andrew, who runs, it'd be like, yeah, listen, these guys, they were a little upset about it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       It's just fucking read it again. It's like, all right, cool. I'll read it, but I don't get the whole whatever. Sit Down Mafia, sit down that you get. So you did get them read it again. I don't know. You don't even know. Ignorance is bliss. Yeah. It's not to call you ignorant. No, I am making. Right, but you don't. But I'm smart enough to know that you don't talk to your advertisers there. It's like I didn't get into podcasting to do a conference call with you fucking guys talking about this shirt you're trying to sell. Like I get it. It's a shirt you wrote. What you going to say? Just like, I don't want to listen to you guys. Like do you just trying to fill up your day? So many people in, in those fucking corporations, they just trying to justify that desk. So then the, the whole, I hate when the conference call ends and then you hear this voice that you haven't heard the whole call and it's like you were afraid that everyone was going to hang up and you didn't say yes and now you're in a panic mode.

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       So then they just throw something out there and you have to address it. Like, it's a legitimate comment w when it isn't, it's just like, you know, go through a lot of those because you went from being working kind of day jobs to doing comedy full time. I presume barely do them anymore. But I used to, I used to do, when I had conference calls on scripts or anything, what I would do would, I would put the phone on speaker and I would throw it to the other side of the bed and then I would go, she got video. I would literally lay on the bed, like with my arm across my eyes and I would just wait for people to stop talking and then I'd just be like, yeah, you know, it sounds good. So I don't know why I can watch so many hours of sports yet.

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       I can't even, I can't even, like, I can't handle more than it. They drive me insane. Um, well I like texting. You don't phone calling someone on the phone. It's almost like an insane thing to do. These, it's like rude. It's like, dude, what? Unless you have like sort of sort of intimate relationship. You know what I mean? If I call it you loads, it's important. What happened. If I call him, if I thought, if I call Isla to Chitchat, that'd be weird. Jail. If he called me, I was like, hey, how you doing? I'd be like, okay, what? What is it? You know what I mean? Like I feel like since we've, we had the kid, my wife finds me calling her man. No, it's annoying because she either is in the middle of his shit storm or she finally got a break and then my dumb ass is going to be like she, she this Guy Sean supermarket, she just like, I just feel, I just want my, I got 10 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:45:29       This list. Yeah, so she's a trooper. Oh, I wanted to tell you about this make good we got and I think I need to remove myself because it's actually drove me crazy. It was funny though. They said, I said, when I was doing a copy read, get your free trial for $5 but what was written was for 95 and they said, you have to do it again for free because you said $5 instead of four 95 you should've just said, well, I'm not doing that. We did. They said, okay, yeah, okay. Yeah, that bluff and they're holding nothing. Yeah. You have to do it again for free. No, I know, but no, it is totally a game of being better because you went higher, so now all my God, I just save the nickel. I love this fight. Exactly. It's a twist. Yeah. No. If you said like you know for 50 then they find out is for 95 then they have a 45 cent.

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       Now we've got a problem, man. Okay. Yeah. Now you have a conference call. Now nobody's going to chime in on that one. Hmm. How do I, as a fan of your podcast, the Monday morning podcast, everybody who was not listening to the Monday more podcasts, please do because it is my favorite. How do you prepare for that podcast? Because you sit down and get talk and I swear to God it's like you're doing material. But yeah, no, you're just talking. But like I always wonder, how do you prepare? Do you prepare at all for your podcast? I, uh, Andrew sends me the advertising, copy it, I copy and paste it and then he sends me the questions for the week. I copy and paste that and I stick it under the ads. I never broken down my whole game thing, my game film. And then what I do is I'll just write pats game, you know, topics, big feet, blah, blah, blah, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:47:12       And then I just start talking and uh, if it's not going well, I go to the list. If it goes great, I barely look at the list and all of a sudden I looked down and I've done like a half hour and a half or even done the region. I know that the question goes one, I'm going to take like, uh, 20 minutes or so and um, yeah, that's basically how I do it. No, but through wound, you're going throughout the week in between podcasts, do you take notes of Shit you want to talk about or do you sit down and you're like, oh, I remember that. I won't talk about that. No. Like I need a side on topics as I just sit down and I just thought and I'm just like, ah, fuck what happened to me in the last, I know something happened and you can build the anecdote about like, uh, you were making a sandwich and the lady was, she asked for a special thing and the lady was just like, no.

Speaker 1:          00:47:56       Oh my God. But, which was so funny, but I would remember because you know what I hated about the guy was he was, he was on his tip toes watching. I wanted a Bagel and I feel like they can visualize, they wanted butter on them and you know, it's just fucking airport. Yeah. And they've got like the little, the little, you know, little conveyor belt thing and they sent it through and he's, he was just sitting there like, like a mere cat. Right. And, and he was just annoying me because I've had that job. It's just like we just met him, make the thing and be done with it. And he just said, oh, could you, could you, could you just put the butter on it? I would just put the butter on it and she's, and she was just like, she was like a, like a grisled vet.

Speaker 1:          00:48:32       She was just like, what? Can you just, I was just wondering, can you, can you put the butter on it now? You know, before I go to register, she goes, oh, the buttons over there. And he goes, no, no. I was just hoping, can you spread it now? So like, cause it's still warm. I want it to be melted. Can you do that? And she just goes, no, I love that fucking laugh. And I looked there and she just looked at me and be like, half a cigarette hanging out on him. I'll say, what do you want us like ham and cheese? But I guess that that mammary was you, you, you have a good memory I think because I don't think I would have held onto even even something that precious. But you've always got, I mean, you do a twice a week too, so there's a lot of time to fill, but you somehow capture these memories and retell it in a way optic, you know, I got it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       You have the tower clip. My favorite little bit up on my podcast is because I'm making my wife laugh, which is my favorite thing in the world. She has the greatest lots of cute and thank you. I can be adorable. That is like my pocket. That could be a horrible every once in a while. Um, I told her this story of a, I first told the story of watching this old guy wipe out on a scooter sliding on his face. And then it reminded me of this time I saw this guy, um, this guy in griffith park was in street clothes and went down the steepest hill and wiped out and I was telling the story. It was like a Sherry sperry thing that it started making me laugh and then my wife started laughing and you know, that story that listening heard her laugh.

Speaker 1:          00:50:02       That's why we got married, that, that whole story, right. The chemistry and that whole thing. Like I, I listen, I listen, I'll go back and I listened to that like once a year and a no, I feel lucky that I met somebody that has like, she's as funny as most comedians I know, and she has an incredible sense of humor and um, it's kind of a, it was, yeah, it was just something that, you know, someone like me, a lunatic, I needed someone like that, that could laugh that hard if somebody's falling off a skateboard. How did you guys meet, by the way, you and your wife? Um, well, she's in the business. She worked on, um, Chappelle's show, but she didn't, I was on season two. She was on season actors or no, she was, uh, um, what was she on that, I forget what she was on that one.

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       But on, on tough crowd was when I met her. She was a talent coordinator, but she also was an actress. She's been interactor than I am. Every bit is funny. So she's like one of those people that is so good at everything. It's trying to figure out which direction to go in where I am a one trick pony. That's not true. Uh, if you really look at it, if you look closely, yeah. If you look at the credit, wow, this guy's all over the place and they're like, hey, you got a TV show fucking break. Give me a break. Yeah. And I play Frank Murphy, who's allowed screaming jackass. I do stand out loud screaming jackass. I do my podcasts in the movie. Jack be driving over here loud screaming jackass. You're planning, you see DC AC DC, three courts. But seriously, the movie does seem to not to be a departure from the loud screaming jackass.

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       Which movie? The one that's going out in front runner? My God. Yeah. I mean I saw it from the trailer's not that much information, but you seem to be playing a very sincere detective. Did I understand that role playing a reporter. Oh, your report. Okay. Who works for them, who mysteriously still possesses my Boston accent and mean, well hugh grant, who I think is going to get nominated for an Oscar like in between takes is speaking like us. He's Australia and that's what he talks like and then an action and then he's, he's fucking Gary Hart. That wasn't nice. I find that amazing. I probably shouldn't, it's because as opposed to me who just memorized his lines and tries to make it sound believable. Well I can't wait to see that movie looks really good. It really, when I saw the trailer office, uh, it's amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:52:20       I have to start learning everybody else's name in it because I, um, I was only on it for a and with a limited amount of actors because everybody just crushes it. It's a bunch of, you know, to me that kids, I'm 50 so they're all in their twenties and thirties and I was just like, you know, I was kind of watching and going like, hey, here's the next batch. Like these men and women are going to be be doing stuff. So I'm very happy for all of those people. Are you, it's hard to tell from the trailer, but is it a major role in the film or is it more of a like kind of secondary character? Uh, more like a 14th. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright. Do you want to act the more movies you seem to enjoy it. I love it. I really, I, I, it's, it's weird now that I have a kid, but I learned on that one that the next time I'm just going to rent a place and bring my wife and kid.

Speaker 1:          00:53:09       That was, yeah, that was hard. Oh my God. My kid today was coolest thing ever. Like she occasionally now speak since we'll do two words, you know, if she's not shy or anything like that. So she had to get one of her shots today and she's been over there a bunch of times, so she knew. So she would go to the doctors and she was like, you know, getting all nervous, like, like a dog going to the vet. So, you know, they're gonna shoot it into a little cute little thigh and like she's sitting there and she's like, ah. And she shot her and gave her the shot and she starts crying and she goes, okay, it's over. When she say, yeah, she looked at the nurse, she goes, oh, done five, five.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       Oh, I like broke my heart. And I was proud that she said three words and she totally communicate. It's like, yeah. It seems like you're in love with your daughter hearing you talk about her on the podcast quite well. You've pretty perceptive like a carrot more than that. Okay. Because again, you're this character, you gush, Gush over your daughter. Not everyone. Gushes did your Dad Gush over you? Uh, I mean I was too little. Yeah. Now my dad was, my dad actually at worked it at work. That's what I learned. Like, oh my God. Yeah. He really likes us. Oh, when he came home, Hey, he was cracking the whip your bed mate, you're doing your studies. Well, why not? You know, is that shit? And uh, he also had a zillion kids, so I mean, yeah. How many siblings do you have? I don't know, Dude.

Speaker 1:          00:54:34       The Internet's too fucking weird to give out all that information. You don't even want to say how many because you're afraid that it will optimize your talking about it. Is there anybody you can cut this out? I'm honest dude. Like seriously dude, I, yeah, this fucking lunatics out there. Okay, well off the year, off the year. I'll tell you. Alright, cheese. I love how surprised he is. Chief actual lutely crazy. Keep walking. No, I'm not. What I gotta do, what you have to do is just consistently lie and changed names. I actually, I do have friends that do that. I don't think I'm smart enough to do that, but I have friends who are youtube burns their front facing persona that everyone knows them by their name and everything is a complete fabrication and they're brilliant. I wish I thought about that because we've had creepy people coming to our house, the same assholes that created a lot of this spy where shit like if you're already thinking that, oh, they just had a, or they are smart, you know? But yeah, if I could, well I could never do it all over again because of what I do. I need social media. But if I wasn't, um, you know, a performer, if I was a manager or anything like that, I would have a website but I would not be on social media at all. Interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       All right. I don't know why that's so flat on my part. Tell me about, uh, all things comedy. I Dunno. You say I'm nervous. I'm sweating here. I'm just going to let you sit. I know you are. You don't have to save me. You got to push through to the other side. No, I know, but you're not touching elliot. If you are a lever on the other team, I'd have come out and check you for vaseline or something. You punched your hair and you feel a little too many times. He's doctor in the ball. Shit. Alright. Regroup. Um, Jackie gleason. I think I have a question about your [inaudible] you being in that and having a kid. We have been trying to have a kid and the longer it takes, we also kind of second question the whole thing, like should we have a kid? It's awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       It's one of the few things that truly lives up to the hype reel. All these years of being lied to about the summertime movies. The good thing is it's awesome and uh, you know, what do I know? I'm only a year and a half fence. So my year and a half experience has been incredible. And the only advice I would give you is don't listen to 90% of other parents because for some reason they take a joy out of trying to ruin the experience. Saying like, Oh, you wait, is your first one is going to change? No more drinking. Oh my God gets leave now it says they just hit you with all this dread and I was walking, I was just gonna be like, you sound like a terrible father. Like you don't sound like you're enjoying it and that road, no. Well why didn't you say all that positive stuff? You contin, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:57:28       Like, that's just, it's just how people just like to complain. No one shit trying to like a pass on the knowledge. It's just like, but in an annoying way. Yeah. No. Like for the optimist, I'm telling you. No, I got a lot of sweetness in it. Yeah, no, I, yeah, I'm, I am not what people think. I want to ask you about all things, comment. You've got what, what is all things comedy? Is it a production company? Is it a podcasting network? I mean, this is a company. It's every, it's everything. It's first it started off, uh, you know, years ago we were watching the whole podcast thing exploding and then watching what always happens, like the artists create a seed and then the businessman comes in is like, okay, here's the deal. I'm going to wrangle all this up. I'm going to own it, but you're going to get all this exposure and you're going to have to tap dance for the rest of your night and I'm gonna have a fucking yacht in five years.

Speaker 1:          00:58:22       Right? So we're like, well, why, what's stopping us at this point? The technology had come up about where you could actually start your own thing. And there was podcast networks out there where they, they were doing this thing where they owned a percentage. Oh, of it. Yeah. Owns your podcasts. Worked with telling everybody going, dude, don't get, you don't have to give that away. But like, um, you see that kind of stuff on youtube a lot too. Right. But, but a lot of people from my generation, you know, in a weird, like a prison kind of thing. You were institutionalized where you just thought, I can't own anything. I need to go to bigger thing. It's like, no dude, you have your own tv right here, your own channel. Um, so we tried to do more of a Co op where everybody owns the thing, um, owns their podcast and uh, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:07       So that's basically what, and we all hype each other's projects, offers these, um, when the guys are network network from the diversity effect podcast, when he had his first comedy cd come out, we all tweeted about it at the same time and put out a great album and that came together and he went number one on itunes and [inaudible] both the United States and in Canada as an unknown at that point. And now we just produced a, a standup special for him, uh, for comedy central. And comedy central has bought, uh, three more hours from us. So we're going to produce so now and now we kind of get to pick and choose people that we like these guys, men and women that we think are hilarious. So, um, and uh, so then, you know, I'm currently writing a movie and you know, we, we partnered with soapbox films and you know, you know, I'm writing with somebody who isn't with all things coming, but if he likes it, we're going to drive it through there and just kind of build this thing up.

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       And the whole thing was, you know, uh, to do this, trying to do it the right way. It was was quite a task, but we just, we just don't, we wanted to have comedians to have a frigging rail light that they could go to where everybody wasn't just trying, you didn't tell him to fuck you over like on like on specials and stuff like that. This shit that goes down really that, yeah, that stuff that goes down it, you may like pie slices of the pie going and all different directions and like people haven't side deals with networks that suck or going out of business, you know, that's something that we ran into and it's just like, Hey, every specialty you bring us to, you get, you get 60 grand. So then all of a sudden this guy 60 grand, it's not going to tell you, hey, go to this shithead network instead of that instead of like a Netflix or something where it's going to be seen.

Speaker 1:          01:00:53       Yeah. And it's just like, I'm like, yeah, that's only the tip of the iceberg. And then like, you know, expenses and all this and all this stuff and like sky high expenses with no accountability. Yes. All of that type. Well the thing was, you know, back in the day it was like, you know, I swear to God there was some people that literally had like insight people like tmz has at the airports and say, you know what, celebrities are going through. Like they would literally have insight people to network and they would figure out what your budget was cause you get in business with a production company and you'd be like, what can you shoot this for him? It's like, well how much money you got? It's like, well I'm gonna fucking tell you that. And they would somehow, I swear to God, like if you had $1 million, they'd be like, oh we did the budget is gonna be like 999,000 and then if you had like nine bucks, it'd be like, he's gonna be $8 and 99 cents like that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       They are, they're always like vacuumed up everything. But that final fucking 8%. And then you know, that they went out and they shot the thing for like 70. Yeah. Like not even probably whatever, whatever the number was. And they just skimmed it. Just took it not skim and dude, they took a giant some fucking shovel out of there. And um, you know, I, that's the one thing that, that they only like the one thing that has been really a disappointing getting into the business world because I know it's not just the business that I am, but just the level of what you say the business world. You mean own being and don't just thinking because entertainment business has a bad rep, but it's just straight across the board. The uh, the level of c I just unabashed stealing that happens in business and they justify it.

Speaker 1:          01:02:26       They sleep like babies. Yeah. It's, it's so rampant that I don't even, I don't understand people that like steel, like you, like anybody, if you're a thief, like you should be working towards getting on the legal side of stealing because there's probably more stealing on the legal side of stealing. And now you don't have to hide the car. It's all above board or whatever. And it's just like, you know, you see things like a lord of the rings. It grows like, I don't know how many billions of dollars a year. Like the director had to like sue, like the better Jackson suit that they didn't pay him. They right. They were saying they were not in, in uh, profit. And it's a routine thing. I'm learning this, you know, writing a movie. It is, it is a routine experience to be in one side of, um, what are these big conglomerates pitching the sequel will while in the other side of the building and the legal department you're suing them for not paying the first of that is so fun.

Speaker 1:          01:03:28       Yeah. And just like auditing and all of that, all of that with what they have. This shit I've seen, I've been through these clubs were like, you can audit us and if there's less than a 5% discrepancy, you have to pay for it. Five is good. I usually get like 12 how do you, how do you fuck up paying me 12% yeah, so and then all it's accounting, it's numbers. Then you have to pay for the audit you bought. So they kind of gave themselves a license to steal exactly. Eggs that that's all that means. I saw my first constitute what we legally owe you but, but we're going to write this so we can steal this and then if they really greedy they'll actually go like beyond it. No, there there are some, well they have nothing to lose click and characters out there.

Speaker 1:          01:04:08       The first time I saw that clause I was like, okay, so I have a 5% discrepancy, which means you're going to take 5% more than you are and that is considered being difficult if you say that. Yeah. That's the, which to me means what? Difficult like difficult to steal from. Yeah. That happened to us all the time because in youtube in the beginning there was so much not going on and we would not let it slide and say, hey, we've got a youtube channel. I remember they had this thing where if any of your videos get flagged then you can cock sucker can take your revenue. Well they said you don't get the advertisements. I said, oh, so you don't run the ad? No, we still run it. Well then he fucking gets it taken it what it is. Some would have a whole team of people youtube just flagging shit now are, that's what they do is like the, I'm, I'm, I'm dealing with this shit all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:04:57       What happens is if you're a copyright holder, and I mentioned you like we have a video just talking about something and I mentioned a clip, right? Maybe I show it for a split second. So they've got people, probably just some interns, low-level grunts that just claim it and they get the money and they make so much money like that cause they just math do it. Do you know, my thing is when they're in the meeting and they present doing that, they presented like they are on a good mission. Like you guys aren't there and they're basically presented how they're going on a crusade there. Copyright. That's what they, yeah, we have to protect our copyright because there's all these pirates online stealing content and we're standing up for ourselves. No, but I'm saying like if, if they feel like what you said was offensive to somebody, they would flag it like, oh yeah, then I shit, it's just like that's going to be every clip.

Speaker 1:          01:05:52       Yeah. It's frustrating. But yeah, it's, it can be really frustrating, especially when you spend like a whole week working on a video. Cause that's a lot of youtubers will post like one video a week. Right. And then all of a sudden some assholes just like mine. That's my money now. How cause they collect, they'll claim it because maybe showed some of their work and there's a fair use, which means that you're allowed by US copper about ripping people off. I'm just talking about you put up your own original content. Yeah. Talking about, you know, no, it's, it's original content. But if we talk about something like a news way or reacting or talking or criticizing, you know, sue him, you can do, yeah, but you up. But then you have to get that rep out there that you do that it, this is the bullying thing again.

Speaker 1:          01:06:37       Like, I don't, I don't fuck with the h three podcasts, man. These guys don't go sue you. It's not worth the headache. Waveband thought I lost a really big on. We didn't win. You won. Won. That's great. When's the movie coming out? Man? I went out real good movie. It wasn't feeling good at the time, but it was, uh, you know, I don't give a shit if you're recovering from that, but I'm sure this is light goes on and show business as well. I don't know what goes on straight across all the other business. Yeah. War All the way down to the business of, of a standup special. It's like the people that are always, you know, with the shovel, not skimming, shoveling money out, they're such fucking rich. They're so rich all the time too. And it's like they just cannot be fair. I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          01:07:24       Yeah. That's the thing. Like, I just wish I could talk to him and just like ask them, well, I mean I'm, you know, I'm not a perfect person. I maybe that's just, you know, where I fuck up in other areas of my life. Maybe this is just their thing, but I, I just, you know, fucking some, you know, college kid out of the money on his, on his page, I don't know. Or some new comic on a special. And so anyways, that's those, it's basically, that's why we started, you know, all things comedy and now it's just grown into this thing. We, uh, you know, we're going to produce some TV shows who's starting to sign some deals and yeah. And it's like a management, uh, no, you represent them. No, no. We're all conglomerate. Yeah. And we'd like a production. We can also like, um, uh, you know, whatever you would want to do, the soapbox films they laid, they literally end to end.

Speaker 1:          01:08:14       It's a, a union. Yeah. The edited, like the muppet movies and all of that. These guys can handle any bullshit idea that I ever have in there. So, um, while all the comics are, I love, I mean you got, you have so much talent there and your youtube channel is amazing love. Actually. We're doing us. Something's burning. Burning. Oh thanks. Bertine. Yeah. Or crushed. This is why I'm here. He told me, he goes, you got less burden. He's such a sweetheart. Um, do you watch you two videos at all? Yeah, I love Youtube. Really? How can I do I want, um, I like lions killing hyenas. It always annoys me that they fucking come over and they take the shit, you know, and then the lines ended up in the tree, you know, uh, justice, my own idea. I watch anime. I watch a lot of musicians videos, like nobody's doing drum covers of songs and they'd be, oh, I'll watch them and maybe I'll learn something.

Speaker 1:          01:09:13       Um, you don't follow you tubers. I feel like there's two types of people. There's like people that, cause there's so much great stuff on Youtube. Look tutorials and documentaries and stuff. I watch that shit. I, I don't get it like you want, it annoys me. The worst is when there's like a, say something happens like, okay, so you were showing me that clip or whatever. The little fellow there slide known his face, right? Yes, the face grind. So it's just like, it'll just say little person, epic face grind. Right. And then it comes on and all of a sudden this guy, okay, you're not going to win. I'm always like, shout out the face man. He fucking face. And it's like this isn't even your fucking content. And like there's so many endos so I'm sure I haven't seen the good ones because there's an art form to all of it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:02       But I always just feel like it's always like, you know, eyebrows up, super high energy guys, check, can you believe this? Well then he starts to show right before now watch this. I mean this dude was like, dude, I fucking get it. It's like someone who doesn't know how to tell a fucking story and things should be over in like 30 seconds and now I got to sit to fucking three minutes. He get bullshit. That is kind of a meme on youtube was like the tutorials where you're like, okay, I'm going to show you how to use photoshop. And then like 10 minutes, 20 seconds. Then after describing his whole life story, he gets to the point now he knows the worst. It was expert village. Oh I love that. You've been around. Excellent. Rich. What the fuck? I want to show you some of my favorite expert that was playing guitar and so expert village Ozzy and it was always wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:11:05       Hold on. Always stuck. The expert village was a phenomenon. I love it. We made one of my most cherished videos about expert. Exactly. Nobody wasn't that. They were [inaudible] about like how to make a cheese melt and then don't, don't put it in the microwave for 30 seconds. And that's the thing. Wait, I got to show you how to flirt. I hate it. And then they would like, they were like, you couldn't get away from him for awhile. Like you'd go to a search and then all of them. Cause you mentioned expert village, I think it's important to bring you, show you what's up here. Okay, look at this guy now. I've now this video I love because look how much dead air there is. Okay, well it's not. That's not hitting. He'll get blamed. That's not his fault. Well, either way they uploaded it. I mean they could've cut it for Christ's sake. It is his fault because I think they make the video and then they submit it to expert village and then expert village puts it up. So here we are. Size

Speaker 5:          01:11:59       is the lighting with his shadow on the back wall to look at that. You getting seduced tie. This is how we got no sound. Oh, I'm a social dynamics instructor. And on behalf of expert village girl at a bar, how to flirt with the girl picking up women in bars and clubs, flirting. What is it? Hmm? The basics of flirting is to convey through certain ideas and emotions that you like someone else and hopefully that the other person likes you back. Now who are the best flirts in the world? They're actually little kids now. Why is that? Well for one thing, they did the best imaginations I was already feeling. Basically,

Speaker 1:          01:12:43       you know where the sexiest people in the world, little kid

Also little kids or how do you do that as an adult? They're realizing

So she's you, you know, I used to hear that

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       on Howard stern all the time and I never know what it's from and I thought it was like a crazy orgy sound like I never knew. And then when I saw it, I got f obviously I got to pull it up now. Uh, she's smashing grapes, right? Great Lady. Ric flair videos. Great. Here you go. This is it. Good enough.

Speaker 2:          01:15:42       lives. Just to put those things up on that platform. That woman is how I got to hold his shoes up there. I can't be all that sound man. I love it. You can't beat it. You remember this slide you have to do talks about her or they didn't play enough. But I want to show you, I want to remind you of this, this great.

Speaker 6:          01:16:02       There's like your hands to hand model. Like to say that my hands look good naked. They are really just the perfect, neutral, toned hands. So that the hand model is, and it's a very even tone while heading, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess creepy, creepy shit. Wow. This is good stuff. That's stuff that we've made videos about. I'm sorry. You're very protective of her house.

Speaker 2:          01:16:27       What else was going on? I want to ask you about this. Um, this is one of the first time I heard about you. I was in college, I think at the time it was when you were getting booed by thousands of people. And I was like, when you said my favorite youtube video is like, Oh God, not the philly thing again. And then you did the Sherry's berries. I was like, I love this podcast now. I hate you. I love, what can I do? I love that joke and I'm fucking with you. Do it. But no, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna ask for, I get that boat. But Barb, you've, you've talked about this a lot. Probably more than the grape lady. I didn't realize. No, but I go ahead. Let's do it. Skip it. I like making them, well, what am I, what am I going? Yeah, right. And now what do you want me to be? Well, what was going through your head bill, when you're good by all those people? I don't know. I don't remember what was going through your head. No, I'm kidding. This is going to end up on youtube. This is lie.

Speaker 1:          01:17:37       This is going to end up on youtube was what I was what I was thinking. Cause everything else on the tour was ending up on youtube so that, um, yeah, I guess that's what was going on. So no, I think I thought that afterwards and I'm like, well that's going to be embarrassing because I didn't know how people were going to take it. I thought people were just to say, oh, you got booed, you fucking stink and blah blah. I didn't know that people were going to find it funny. Fortunately they did.

Speaker 2:          01:18:01       You did kind of win the audience over. Did you feel that while you were on the stage or was it just like, these people hate my guts the whole time? Because it was no

Speaker 1:          01:18:09       thought it was a complete failure. I have no idea. Uh, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:18:13       Well, I don't know how many of our fans have seen it. I've got to pull up a clip. Okay, go ahead. Go ahead by God. We should skip this. No, no. Go ahead and push the skin. I should have been more of, I should have been a better sport. No, you're a good sport. You're doing your thing. You're being authentic. You're authentic. Now this is just going to, now this is the kind of thing that somebody who buys a dog does, right? Yeah. Wow. Really? Get me deep down. Get down to the ground. Um, now this is just going to be about me being uncomfortable showing you this video.

Speaker 1:          01:18:45       I imagine there's a bunch of comments though. Now going half. Fuck you. The Eagles beat the Patriots. I would think that there'd be a bunch of that.

Speaker 2:          01:18:50       Someone these to animate this two years ago, but the video quality is fucking weird. Anyway, they all Bujo I, yeah, all you guys get it. But for me that was my first heard about you. Was that a big moment in your career? Like a, did you get a lot of recognition with it cause it kind of went viral back then? I mean that's the first time I heard of you.

Speaker 1:          01:19:13       Uh, yeah. Um, well I got, I got, um, you know, respect from other comedians, which was probably the thing that I remember most. But um, as far as like people coming out to the comedy clubs to see, I don't think that that happened. I, I, the reason why when I started drawing on the road was because I did a, uh, I did a half hour on hbo and I was sitting in for Jim Norton on the opiate Anthony show cause he was doing, uh, Lucky Louie at the time when Louis Ck was at hbo. So I kind of had those two things hit at one time. And then so I was able to kind of get the coasts in ONA, mark, not, not the south, but sort of, I had the east coast and then I had like San Francisco, I could do well in and then open it. They were good right through like Cleveland.

Speaker 1:          01:20:01       So an opiate anthony also would run like, uh, you know, they, you know, they didn't have the budget at Xm, I think it was back then to pay us for our appearances on the show. So they would let us literally cut commercials about where we were going to be and they were really funny and it was, you know, it was one of the cool, like it was really cool that they did that and it was a major reason why, you know, all of us started selling tickets. So I really missed that show. I really do. How did the comedians react? Because I remember some guy tried to Yankee off stage towards the end it was like, hey, how about the next comedian that happened? I don't even remember that here. I got it. I got it. The thought. You've seen it so many times. Why would I want to relive that?

Speaker 1:          01:20:47       I've never seen get out. Let's get, let's get, let's get, I've known. What else? I had a headache for like two days. I've been really, really well. You were really stressed out afterwards about it. I was, I remember walking around New York the next day looking at people thinking of insults. It was not a, yeah, it was, it wasn't a wholesome experience. No, you get booed by 10,000 people, so you just kind of getting that fight or flight mode. So I was kinda stuck in the, I remember riding home with Robert Kelly that night. It was like being nervous about like that. It was coming out. He goes, dude, you realize what the fuck happened tonight. You just told the whole city of Philadelphia to go fuck themselves. And I was sitting there going like, man, when that shit hits you too, tomorrow everyone's going to laugh at me and just be like, oh, you got booed stats.

Speaker 1:          01:21:31       See, that to me is interesting because when I watched that I'm like, it's this. He's on fucking fire. And he's authentic and it must feel incredible to tell 10,000 people to go fuck themselves. And like the most polite way, it felt good to do it. But I, the perception of it when I left was what I was, I was worried about. I mean I was, wasn't, had just started selling tickets in places and then all of a sudden there's this clip and then it's going to live forever on the Internet of me getting booed and there's, there's stuff up there of comics having bad sets and it didn't help them. And I'm thinking like, that's going to happen for me. I mean, how do you get booed and it helps your career? I mean, I don't, I mean in this case that did, but I mean I didn't have any reference to them.

Speaker 1:          01:22:18       He gets booted. She was like, Ooh, you suck. Get out of the fucking business. So I was worried if people were going to understand the kind of crowd that I was in front of. Having said that, like I love Philly crowds and I also love the city Adam happy, you know, it's sucked up. My team lost to him, but I was really happy for them that they finally got a superbowl. Hmm. Well I loved that moment. I love everything. You do the great, great cause I turn it around. Turn around. Well we're old. You uncomfortable that you fucking sit there and compliment me. I almost made it through, I think in ask them myself. I got so close. I had a great time. I did too. I really did. I hope you did. I'm worried about you.

Speaker 1:          01:22:58       I'm playing it up. Alright. But I plan on trying to be funny, but uh, we are all worried about him. Oh my. No, it got real doctor and you got something to live for, right? She was just looking at dogs guys. Hello? We sat with him. He's a great one. Bought them. I bought them from a mill by the way. Yeah. And you said, I appreciate what you people do here at this pub. Well, a instagram photo. Do you gotta do that? You steer ready with the receipt area? Me Fit the puppy mill. You can't believe how many dogs do you have here? Oh Man. By the way. It was kind of, I was surprised when I went to the puppy mill. It was a nice wholesome experience. That guy, he really cared about the dogs. The dogs. Who did he know you were common or?

Speaker 1:          01:23:44       I gave him a call and you said you were coming. Wow. People popped in while we were there. You think they're just like on chain, like he was just, you didn't see the Bait dogs and all that shit. Actually it was a breeze. It was more of a breeder then. Like a mall? Yeah, puppy. In a shredded newspapers situation. How many dogs are there? Only two. They won the week and another one sold out. No more inventory. There you go. You know they outlawed a puppy mills in California or not cow in Nla. You can't sell puppies and Los Angeles. You have to go to thousand oaks or Orange County. How about that? Didn't know that. All right. That's amazing. I wondered why at the Beverly Center that pet store went away. Yeah. I thought it was because of people reacting to that. Some reason you don't care about the fish that are in there though.

Speaker 1:          01:24:36       The durables and all those other things that used to be free. We only care about dogs. It is true. Well dogs need something cause they took the wolf odd of them. So they need somebody to kind of help them along. My dog would not last a day. No, not even an hour on his own. He would be, you ever seen when they take the fangs out of a Cobra? No. I mean I know that doesn't know that. So it's still like doing all that shit. Well that's how they do. You never see that one with the baby just goes up and grabs a snake. They liked, they did a thing where they like, I don't know if they sowed it's fucking mouth shut. It was. It was brutal. Yeah. But the first time you see you see this baby crawling up to a Cobra and you and you're like freaking out and then they just, it's like grabbing onto and the cobras like basically like headbutting most aggressive lights blocked.

Speaker 1:          01:25:21       Bad lesson for a baby. By the way. Don't play with snakes. Yeah. You would think that would be the direction you're going on man. You know, like they somehow get pregnant. Right? Cause that he's supposed to say it. You get pregnant like you are a seahorse. Right. Um, just yeah, just steer them away from the snakes. Have them resend back the snake, respect the snake river. You Little Shit. And this is my house. I'm running stuff wrote down.
