Last time we came out. Is it a. it's just to get at, kind of just get out, take a trip. Nice. See something besides Wisconsin, like the three blocks around.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       Like

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       what do you, what goes on in Wisconsin?

Speaker 3:          00:03:06       Well, we play tennis. You do tear up tennis, tennis. No real play. Real tennis or you know, usually when we don't keep score. It's just more about getting out there and exercise. How frequently do you guys play tennis? Really? You know, if we're doing really good, we'll go every week. But you know, take some breaks. Sure. Reeks charge. But the worse you are at tennis, the more exercise you want them getting. We're really, yeah, we get a lot done when we do that. If you guys were like being out here in La, I will say by the way, that Uber that you guys took that we call it for you take two hours of which I'm very grateful and sorry for. Yeah, it was, you know, a relaxing journey. Stopping and starting

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       Wisconsin. Right? You do. But I dunno, I dunno. It's not have like people on motorcycles over here going through like the blinds, Wisconsin. Like you have like an old grandma, like driving on the wrong side of the road.

Speaker 3:          00:04:25       La driving nuts though,

Speaker 2:          00:04:27       the cycle between the car has always struck me as very oddly reckless behavior. It is, but I think when you're on the motorcycle you feel like you know better than everyone can do this.

Speaker 3:          00:04:41       I'm on a fucking motorcycles. Yeah, till someone like until that grandma going the wrong way. Then all of a sudden

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       I didn't know. They scare me man, because like all the sudden they're recklessness becomes my problem because I'm in traffic. I'm not paying that close attention to like what's in between me and the next car. All of a sudden I'm switching lanes.

Speaker 3:          00:05:04       No, we have a word for them in Wisconsin. She calls them ancient alien. What? The motorcycle. Old People, old people. It's anyone who's like, you know, and they're driving the wrong way down the road or they like just stopped in the middle of ancient aliens.

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       Old people that just can't see. And college kids that are just dumb as hell and mishmash both.

Speaker 3:          00:05:39       Imagine that you know that guy from h and alien, the crazy aliens. That's who's driving all those cars and I'm talking about, well clearly they're like not in this world right now. They're like, this is like, what do you do? Have you guys ever been in a car crash? A, I have not been in one,

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       but I wasn't very. She machine ancient alien thing. She's been in a lot of accidents stuff. Maybe she is, but after seriously never her fault, but she's always done that. What was it like? What happened? Uh, one with some lady just went through a red light and just crushed into one. That was probably the worst one was. Yeah, it was pretty scary. Are you injured? No, we're fine. What? Did the car hit? Your side? Yeah. Damn. Our car didn't get killed though. They're their card. Did got maybe what car. What car were you in? What car were they in? Do you remember? I don't remember. How old are you?

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       17 or 16 year survivor. That's pretty scary to get at a red light. That's not a. that's like a serious. It was, you know the back. Okay. You spun out maybe. Probably Shit. I can't remember anymore. You blocking it out of your memory suit from Adam. What about you? You've been in a car accident. I'm just once. I kinda like I was someone who was parked like in the middle of the street so I was going to go wrong with them and then all of a sudden they started to do it. You parked in the middle of the street, like it was waiting for something waiting for you so it could hit you, but it wasn't nothing serious. It's all good, but that's it. My Dad ran. Someone wants, my dad is an ancient alien and the eight he is a liability. Have we told the story about how in Mexico, like my dad is a psycho thought ever get in a car with them?

Speaker 2:          00:07:46       Uber driver, you have like one star driving around all day and nobody would ever get like, I don't know what happened. We were getting off the off ramp and I was I think in the back seat and he just rear ended a car. Just rammed it. Somebody like you do. But there was a one time in Mexico, he's got like an suv and they used to live in Mexico and he just driving on the freeway and Mexico like way over the speed limit so fast that we're taking a sharp turn and you can feel the tires of lifting God. You could feel it being like my mom's in the car, I'm in the car dealers in the car. That's the first time you guys met, right? Sort of. So imagine. Wow. Well the story gets better. Imagine that. Imagine that. This is how you're behaving around your son. First Time you're meeting is serious partner. Right? And we're all yelling. My mom's going crazy. We're all yelling. Gary and Isla, who doesn't know my dad says he starts yelling at him. That's how fucking and meanwhile my dad is so crazy. That's there silently doesn't even acknowledge it continues to rip the turns.

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       It's weird. You like shuts down. I knew it was fucked up. I should probably. Everyone was. It was scary. And my dad, he's, he's on the road. He went to Ucla. I don't know if you guys know about like college rivalries. He went to Ucla, which is University of California. Their rivals in La is USC. They're like huge sports rivals, so his license plate said hates sc and it's still, I think, made to have that license. So when he sees someone on the road, what they use, license plate holder license, we'll cut them off and I swear to you with children in the car and the whole family, he will cut off another person on the road with his eighth sea, like as if they were as if they were Nazi war sickness. That's scary. But I'm sweet guy though. But anyway. What are your parents like? Your parents have any crazy uh, corks. Mom is fun. Oh, that's a good teacher. It's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:10:37       She's, you know, she's uh, she has guess she has a excuse because she's a teacher. That is, if you're a teacher for like for like five years, you're like your mental patient and if we just keep going, it's just worse than worse. What grade does she teach? Uh, I think she was teaching second or third. Oh Wow. Let's stop now. She used to teach middle school or high school and middle school. Middle School was way worse. Scary to me. In middle school. High school was really bad. Middle School's really bad. Yeah, and then the greatest second. That's crazy. Which one's the craziest? Middle School or second grade? I think high school and middle school. That's like getting into fights. Yeah. I feel like middle school's got to be the worst. Right? Dangerous minds. What's the actress's name and dangerous minds know that moment, right? She was like this, like pretty young blonde teacher who's teaching in like the hood that was is called the poetry one. There could have been poetry.

Speaker 2:          00:11:50       Michelle pfeiffer. Oh, I did not know that. It's called. Oh yeah, baby. I love that movie. Throw that up. Let me show you what your mom is up to. Right. Dangerous minds. Got It. I remember watching this as a kid and being like, damn, she's so cool. She's so cool. She connects with a trench coat. I can't really wear trench coats to the school anymore, so it's just like real knife in Wisconsin, right? The chalkboard. We want to die. Oh Shit. It's crossed out, we choose to die to get it straight. Buster your mum do any lessons like that, but I think. I think middle school is the worst because they're like

Speaker 2:          00:12:40       in middle school you're such a piece of shit and high school you're starting to learn a little bit. That's true that you're an idiot. You're still an idiot. No. Yeah. Full blown, but it'll cool. All right. Jason's mom looks just like him that well. He looks like it's. Oh, it's cute. Yeah, they have the same like mouth and nose. Kinda pick summit sometime. So I've got. I'm trying this new thing. When we start our podcast, we're doing this thing called goof for the day. I've got some clips lined up. I don't want to walk through with you guys. Okay. The first one is dj Khaled at performing at an overwatch league is good. It's great. What I love about this is that he's like dj cows, not a performer, right? It's like the hype man. So imagine like flavor flave without a band or anyone to back them up with actual musical palette. It's just that stage. It's crazy. Here we go. What does he have?

Speaker 4:          00:13:44       Oh God bless.

Speaker 5:          00:13:58       By the way, you framed this up,

Speaker 2:          00:14:00       so like there's like 10 people actually waving their arms and their exit. Well, the rest of the room, it's just like not interested at all. Let's see. Just a strange event. Bam. It's like Justin Bieber's not. They're singing that DJ count, which is the worst part of every music video.

Speaker 5:          00:14:27       Oh No.

Speaker 2:          00:14:32       Or five. And it's like, are you serious right now? That's a good question.

Speaker 5:          00:14:42       And one more thing.

Speaker 2:          00:14:46       What it makes it look like, what? The phone light.

Speaker 6:          00:14:52       No, but you people are holding their phones up. They are. They're making it look like they're holding their phones up. No Way. People have their phones out.

Speaker 2:          00:15:02       Wristbands probably. Oh, maybe like an event wristband.

Speaker 5:          00:15:11       Yeah. Looks confused. You can't do without the rest of the bank. You know what I mean? Like you take out another one is another word you said plants. By the way, these guys were paid to dance. Did you not even see happening at this point? Gala?

Speaker 2:          00:16:19       No. Get your own concert. But like at a concert you, you think that this could go on for two hours straight, but you don't want to appreciate him for even having the courage to do in this kind of like, it really doesn't give a fuck. But like a blizzard hired him. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:16:45       It probably paid him like. I mean, I don't think he would go out there for less than $200,000. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       We paid them pretty good

Speaker 5:          00:17:05       black. Alright.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       You sing it

Speaker 5:          00:17:18       good.

Speaker 2:          00:17:21       That was really good. What do you think? You found a decal? I was out of all the performances, a blizzard. That was probably the number one the most.

Kamasi Washington. I don't know if that's how you say it. I've got another clip lined up. I love Stevie, but like have you. How long have you been listening to Stevie? Or did you just kind of get into it? So you, you've been riding the Stevie and Michael trend for a long time. Do you share his musical tastes

Speaker 3:          00:20:56       well? Yeah, because he controls

Speaker 2:          00:21:00       horse musical taste. If you had control of the cds, what would you play?

Speaker 3:          00:21:04       I have one CD. Where's his six? Yeah. I don't know. I tend to just listen to like whenever it comes on, like the student radio or something like kind of different like all the time. So I mean if I had to say all time favorites. Actually I really like Lana del Rey, which is like I'm familiar. I know I really liked her. She one of the ones that, was she one of the ones that died or something like people are like, she's like a recent pop artist. Yeah. That's kind of the only like pop like thing. Listen to you. I listened to a lot of nineties music. I guess it bird radio station. I remember that. Yes. There's a radio station that plays bird.

Speaker 2:          00:21:57       Nice. What's it called? Talking about like, uh Oh, cancer. The leading killers of birds. Cats are the leading. There's a lot of birdwatchers and what's actually. I've heard that, that like that's funny. Like cats are actually decimating the populations really. I guess what do we do? You know, if bird radio gets affected, here's this, here's this music that the use interior. Let's see what we got. If you write anything really, really, and I'm ad block

Speaker 3:          00:22:46       got ad block on their Internet explorer,

Speaker 2:          00:22:51       you, you, you opened it with Internet explorer. It looks like it's set to default. Like Gimme a break. I'm using discord and I click a link. In what world would I want to open? Anything in internet explorer? You see it's a total disaster. You know, our sponsors pay us a lot of money to get their ads on our show and here. Sneak right? They didn't pay me shit. Don't download that. Download. Not speak of it off the screen. In fact, I'm gonna. Build them on the invoice. Then you invoice them for me. I'm going to say their name. You're seeing this guy in concert. This is your guy. What's his name? Kamasi Washington. What's going on with him? He looked very like Bohemian. He's cool with that. Actually.

Speaker 7:          00:23:47       I interviewed him a couple of years ago. I shot an interview with him. Yeah, he was really cool. Was the. Was it an interesting interview? Yeah. Yeah. It was just talking about his musical background and everything. He's, you know, he comes from like the jazz world, but you kind of crossed over with all of the um, brain feeder, you know, like Flying Lotus and those people. No, he's, he's cool as fuck. So you say he put his part of that role under cat and all those guys

Speaker 6:          00:24:15       sick. Sounds good. You're all about you like that soul, that soul music. Did you know? Hey Janice.

Speaker 7:          00:24:24       I like it when they pick on it. Stress. Do you hate this stress? I'll take the same level for me.

Speaker 6:          00:24:40       I got another video lined up, another good for the day because I couldn't decide between Dj Khaled and all of the Mexican workers going on strike and this guy filming it and losing his mind about it. Okay. Okay. Good stuff. Planned up guys. Only the best.

Speaker 7:          00:24:54       Let me go get fucked up. They sit on a come together yet. So let, don't know anything about who filmed

Speaker 6:          00:25:10       the story is that they're on some kind of smelting plant. Two of the dudes, I guess their boss supervises our comrades, was all of a sudden rush of Soviet Russia. Their colleagues got fired or sent home for some reason, so they all packed up and said, fuck this, you know, salt, solidarity. So this guy who was working with, I guess there's a bunch of Mexicans and a couple of black dudes. So this is one of the black dudes who's an og of the Mexican camaraderie and spirit.

Speaker 7:          00:25:48       They up this book. Fucking black people need to be your own man. I swear to God. I think they sit up. Isn't this motherfucking on my momma? They are not bullshit. They don't stop up in depth. They thought they was going to play with these amigos. We rise together, homey. It may not take the same. And look at this man. They shut this big day on today. We all went home, man. The Way God bless him. I mean jokes aside for documenting that. I'm with him, dude. That's cool. It's probably going to get in trouble. Oh yeah, he's fired. I'll never work again.

Speaker 2:          00:26:46       I love it that I'm with them. I'm in solidarity, but we need. Why the hell do you think apple is worth a trillion dollars? No unions. They don't have unions in China, I don't think. What do you guys think about apple being worth a trillion fucking dollars? Why are you an apple man? No, I am. I found though. I guess so you're sort of, you're in your foot, your foot's in the water. You like apple? We don't really have an opinion on it. I guess it's very. And we would have to look more into it. I don't want to take any, you know, radical fucking hate bad.

Speaker 2:          00:27:37       I'm using it very sparingly. Waiting for the right you can use that sucks. And I don't understand like have all come. You can keep it of all companies in the world. How is it that apple was the one that got a trillion? I mean, what are they doing? So they just. Yeah, they're the most valued company of all time. The first company ever to be worth a trillion dollars. I mean they sell shit so they aren't getting or many fucking phones. Are they selling? I get it though because everyone's obsessed with that iphone all over the word and there were computers too, so it's like, yeah, I get it. It's expensive to like, how the hell do people afford that shit? But that means to me that like the margins are insane, that they probably are exploiting hell of people for those margins to be so insane. You know what I'm saying? Like for someone to make a million dollars is hard enough, you have to like step on a couple throats along the way to make forget about a billion, a billion. There's a couple of hookers in, in your pool, under your pool, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:28:59       At least several hundred immoral things happening. Yeah. Is Not being followed. Apple is notorious, but it's not just them inside in big, big. Like I was watching CNN, they're doing this whole clip about like, God, I just outed myself for watching CNN. So, uh, anyway, they're doing this whole thing about like celebrating that apple made a trillion dollars and it's like celebrating. Yeah, they've done this whole thing about. They were talking about it in a very glorious way. It wasn't like they were doing party poppers and shit. They had like a counter on the wall, the live stream. But like, I don't know what's the exact figure. But they have evaded so much money. Tank taxes. Yeah. Like how many? A trillion dollars. How many Chinese? Like, I mean do it. That's just Chinese. Lots of Chinese people going down for those phones. I don't know what to say, man. Lots of Chinese people are going down for those faults, but it's okay because they're Chinese.

Speaker 3:          00:30:34       You got to get really quiet. Really quiet. You're going to hit me with the crickets. I'm trying to carry on. You were educating us. We're newcomers

Speaker 2:          00:30:48       to the apple trillion dollar industry. What? Crickets. I only needed one thing button there. I'm curious. You guys ever work like a normal ass job? Yeah. What'd you do before you were the sweetheart of Youtube? Worked at a nursing home. Seriously? From my aunt. What was your day to day?

Speaker 9:          00:31:17       Uh, do stuff on the computer and like take old people to their employee

Speaker 2:          00:31:22       builder. They're like, push them around. You ever do any dirty work?

Speaker 9:          00:31:28       Well you're not supposed to, but like eventually you have to do because it's just like so much stuff to deal with and there's not enough people in. Oh Wow. So it was fairly stressful. I can like, I want to go on my chair and I was like, don't touch old people. You're going to break their back if you'd fucking touch a metal, but the. Then they start getting into by himself. No, you can't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:31:49       I'll support guy. The craziest thing that happened to you, how long did you work there? Uh Huh.

Speaker 9:          00:31:56       Probably more than a little more than a year. What was the craziest

Speaker 2:          00:31:59       thing that, that you saw there?

Speaker 9:          00:32:04       One time I heard a lady, she was like, she would only. She can only say like one thing, she was like, Oh hey, something. I forget what she says. She says like the name Markish Hello Markus. And I could like just here, like one time I was walking and I could just hear like really? I'm like, what the fuck? I opened the up the elevator and she's just sitting in there by herself. Hello mark. I'm like, Oh shit. She was like, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:32:31       elevator. Oh my God. Hello Markus. Such such a hard job. That's kind of sad machine. They're

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       probably not that nine days to put her in elevators. Just does whatever the fuck it wants. You ever have somebody.

That a girl like a damn. That's a thankless job. Yeah. Like that takes a lot of compassion to take up human shit out of a diaper. Not a chat. Not your own child. A hard. You didn't take any shit out of luck?

Speaker 3:          00:33:24       No, I was, I had probably the easiest job in that whole building and you know, it was pretty stressful environment. What about Yulia? I had a few things like, well since high school I had worked at like a convenience store. Basically it was technically a op, but like they just sell a lot of like food and snacks and stuff and I don't know, I worked there on and off for like four years I guess, but just I would like go like to college and stuff for the semester and come back and work. So it wasn't like full time member but yeah. And then uh, the most recent job I had was at a bakery patisserie actually I was just like in the front, sometimes I would help with like decorating stuff or whatever they needed help but not really. It was like a French one that I have a degree in French. So it was like, yeah. Yeah. So like I didn't have like a, you know, any kind of job to do with that. So that was kinda like they were customers who would like speak French with me and like the pastry chef spoke French and stuff so I was just kinda like, you know, that's Kinda how I got into that.

Speaker 2:          00:34:40       Do you still work or are you guys.

Speaker 3:          00:34:43       No, I'm well I've run in the online stores and depth and all that. How, how, how recently were you doing that bakery job? When was it? It was pretty recent that you had like a date would have been? It would have been the winter before last winter. Yeah. And the only reason I quit was because they shut it down. They were like, yeah, it was so weird. They didn't tell us anything leading up to like shutting it down. They were just like, we're going to have a staff meeting on Friday like everyone else to come, and then he was like, so actually it's shut down and

Speaker 2:          00:35:30       yeah. Then you know to a break when we come back, we've got no your man coming.

And then the flip side, at what point

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       do you just walk away from that situation? Because it is pretty familiar. I would have probably left daily. Well, not from this. No, but I'm talking about, you know, let me a street vendor like trick I guess, but I think you know what you're getting into. What would you call that? Ice Cream prankster scream like street, like trash thing. It's always like talking about really got to fight,

Speaker 2:          00:59:52       scream trick. Like an ice cream truck guy. His truck people. Dude, this shit's crazy. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Lots of ideas, by the way, I don't want that cone for my pants. You know what I'm saying? Like Shit, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:00:28       He's going to get it for real. You're loading it up. Loaded up. Idiot.

Speaker 3:          01:00:40       The best act ever pulled it away that this poor guy, by the way, by the time he gets to eat it, it's been in his pocket. It's been on stage. It's like I don't want that ice cream. First one I've seen where they smeared it on it.

Speaker 2:          01:01:11       So in short, that's what. That's how what we did initially. Yeah, that is. I'm trying to be annoying but funny. Got To love those ice cream gentlemen in a parallel universe. But do you think you could pull that off? I feel like you're a gentleman and I carola universe that we're talking about dinner. I didn't know. You're so passionate about Mexican food. I'm very passionate about Mexican food. Yeah, your Taco, Taco master. He knows how to make really good salsa. Yeah, Dude. Nobody. Nobody knows that that's like a. that's like a desired skill among shit. Well, I. So I have one specific salsa. I'm very good at the red and all this mystery stuff. I'm not very good at, but I make a great avocado green salsa. That is excellent. But I'm. I'm thinking we should just hoarder.

Speaker 2:          01:02:13       Yeah, I'm saying get some Nachos. You can't order Nachos? No, don't order not just to get them to the chip. Separate Nachos with chips separate. That'd be kind of making order, but I was just talking about how this morning I'm so tired. I woke up because I've been preparing for you guys just visit last time we were here, we had we cooked dinner. It was so much fun. Amazing chef cooked us up to the current. You guys were loving it. It sounds like that's less. I made it so fun. Cooking for people who are appreciative. I was like, damn, I'm going to pull all the stops for these guys. So I was thinking, well, I woke up at 5:00 AM this morning. I bake chocolate chip cookies, only smoke up your ass. These aren't saying he's so good and I was going to bring some for the guy, the guys, Dan, but I was like not enough cookies for honestly, and I bring that up just to make them feel that I bring that up because I want you to know that you guys are so cookie.

Speaker 2:          01:03:30       Sorry. I'm sorry, but the new thing I'm working on is baking. I'm working on learning how to make sourdough bread. Tell me about that and it's like it's so intense and it's so time consuming, but it's a good starter. I made my own starter from scratch. I think it's in a good shape, really good bread and last Friday it was like professional. While I had made two breads. One was great, one was like perfect. The first one, the second one was a literal brick, but still it was like you could break. The flavor was good. As far as breaks go, pretty important. Structure was off, so I can't wait. I started getting that starter. She's my favorite food. I did. Anyway. I rolled the dough. I proved it, proved it some more. It's in the proven basket now. It's in the fridge.

Speaker 2:          01:04:38       I've got it. Actually this one I'm super proud of because the um, the starter was bubbly and ice crash. It was like really good smell and texture and this morning I was kneading the dough and it was just looking really good. And so I did a little twist because I didn't want to over prove it by the way. Proving people don't know is when you leave the dough out for several hours and the yeast eats the flower so it starts to rise and make it fluffy and turn. It's our team does all the magic. So you prove it, but I didn't want to over prove it. So I popped it in the fridge. That's the twist. I don't know if it's going to work, but it should.

Speaker 3:          01:05:22       I'm not going to work if I buy into that and it's terrible. I'm to, I'm going to feel horrible knowing the slider.

Speaker 2:          01:05:37       I really liked those. So wholesome because Isla is the pickiest eater ever. She loves bread and the bread here in America is so bad. I have no problem with them. Bread here? Yeah. Noticed

Speaker 3:          01:05:48       and define Brenda. She'll just eat a role, but. So yeah, I will just eat plain know the baker I worked out was also a sourdough bakery. Specifically salary. No. Nice. Yeah, so I got a lot of free bread there.

Speaker 2:          01:06:03       Thing that, that we particularly hate. Isla is that there's so much sugar. Like if you go to the store, bakeries have got it going on generally like in a good way, but at the store it's like I've noticed you'll get a hot dog bun and it's got six grams of sugar in it. Yeah, that's true. I don't know. We try to buy like local bakeries. That's. Yeah. We don't really have a baker in Paris. So you guys are on the. You guys are killing it on breads. We try to go to the grocery store. They don't even have like local bake, like bakery stuff at your grocery store. So they always. They're always dry. Yeah. Browse like Ralph's make their own bread and it's like, you know, the rouse lady, she doesn't really care what's going on at that level. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like the bakery fresh, not like artisan. They're fucking around back there. They don't take. They don't take it on the ceiling. Don't take it. You know what I'm doing? I've got oil on my hands so it doesn't stick. I'm neat. I've needed this dough. I don't think they're doing that.

Speaker 3:          01:07:13       Definitely not doing that. So it's so much. Sun is coming up. I'm in the kitchen on wedding oil, on my hands. I need sleeping. I'll wake up upstairs. I'm downstairs sweating. Needed oil on my hands. You know what I'm saying? How come this is a very unusual. It unusual because I knew you guys were coming and I want it to. I'm wanting to do the right thing, but the question is now

Speaker 2:          01:07:45       and I've learned that you were such a Mexican food fanatic, which I appreciate so much is because I was originally planning to cook some filet minions and all my. I'm going to give you the option. I think

Speaker 3:          01:07:57       probably just follow up with my follow up. You got a couple of Chubby. This is good edge.

Speaker 2:          01:08:13       Uh, you guys can have a side conversation. Me and Jason could talk all day about this kind of Hokey. Like my bread, because you see, it seems like you're in deep in the bread world, so this is going to be a real test for me. I'm going to eat it plain. I'm going to eat it with butter. Wow. Nutella we're prepared. You're not. We bought, we bought, we bought butter. Salted, of course. French. Very nice. And Jelly cream cheese obviously. Yeah. I don't usually have cream cheese on it. What's a killer one? Cream cheese and jelly sandwich. That's right. It's really good. So back to the meats because the bread was Scott sorta started dinner and no, we're one course down. Don't jump the gun.

Speaker 2:          01:09:18       So I think that my specialty is definitely cooking steaks so I can do that. But also, I mean Mexican food teco wrongs steak Tacos. You can vary. Yeah, you can vary. Go wrong. There's a lot of bad places. So if we order there's a chance it's going to be bad. It's probably going to be good to ask because I'm Mexican food in Wisconsin. I can't be that. Is there a good Mexican food and there's some good people out there. Are they Mexican cooking? Okay. They produce is not as good. That said, no, Dan, are you speaking from Mexican food and Wisconsin and I might be speaking out of turn because I've never been to Wisconsin, but probably not. By the way, I like the urgency of you to send me a DM. No private life about Mexican food. So why don't we do both? Sometime we should do both.

Speaker 2:          01:10:35       That'd be a fun, interesting video almost. You know what I mean? Yeah. If people are listening to this, if anybody's left lists, they're going to love that one on the best videos was made a really great video about like Burrito density. Did you see? That was so good. He made a video analyzing the content of Burritos in San Diego and it was so fucking great. Opens up the brooders and analyzes. So good. Yeah. The dedication, the conclusion. Well he was analyzing like three different major chains and like if they're making them right because sometimes, believe it or not, they put French fries, embryos, and just kind of a weird twist. Oh No. You know, you know, you get your burger reader in Korea. We Got Burger Rico. What it sounds like, some sounds like some Wisconsin and that's so tough. So do they put ketchup in it? Like my nightmare details. If it's really dedicated to being a hamburger. I have a problem in a Burrito with some French fries in there. Probably that's not okay. There's a lot of them know it's a wrap. It's a wrap. Yeah, it's just her wrap. If you call it a wrap, it's much easier for me to handle. I don't know if I liked it that much.

Speaker 2:          01:12:16       I was like, I will not eat that. You can do it to the mistake and I hated it. I hated it, but I don't think I'm the same way. I hate it and I'll eat it either. On the other hand, I don't like it. I don't even touch it. I'll start. I'm like, yeah, that's why we look like I'm actually, I'm not kidding. I eat two portions of every meal or like one and a half. It's pretty bad. I ended up starving. If I. If it doesn't look perfect to me. Not that it's not that I want to do it, I just can't. Like I can't eat it. I hear you. It's just, you know, you're built from a different cloth. I have a problem. I've my food falling apart and then it's too messy for me to eat on time. We're at the restaurant and the waiter is going by and I'm like, here give me that. Like she was all done with their burger and it was like the whole burger was still there with all this stuff and I've had my whole plate is clear. I'm like, give me that. And right when the waiters going, I'm just taking her whole plate and start eating it. And I was just sitting there like I'm done at. There's no shame in it could look funny. You just walked by and was like, what's going? Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          01:13:52       Oh mcn abuse abusive food. Quarter your time is up. Giving me a burger. I'm sure I'd do that for you. But like I, I'll, I, I can hate an eat so easily. Like I'll not even like it and it's bad for me and it's super high calorie. All fucking eat that shit before you look blinks. That's the worst on like this bed with it tastes bad and it's also bad for you. That is the worst. You're just, you still eat it, but that's what Disney is all about. It's like the corn dog, you know the strange. Like I think I kicked on a corn dog. I felt pretty bad about that, but it's like 2000 cows.

Speaker 2:          01:14:47       Oh, let me look up. How many calories in that weird was the leg? No, I got. I did get the leg by the way. Oh, you got one? Okay. This says 400 calories. I'm here to say that's a fucking outright. A lot bullshit. That is an outright monstrous live. This corn dog is this size is threader serving size. Oh, that's vendors like five servings. Okay. Yeah, I gotta find out. I gotta get to the bottom of this. Can you guys find out what the calories are important? That's a monstrous fucking filthy. Like this big. Like for anyone who has not had it and it's deep fried corn. So awesome. I feel like that's 1200 calories. Lee, do you guys hear about.

Speaker 6:          01:15:46       There was this megabucks jackpot was $543, million bucks. No Damn. So this was like a huge Jackpot in California and I'm 11 employees at one store all went in together on tickets and they won. So basically all of the employees at this one place are now overnight worth like 60 million apiece.

Speaker 2:          01:16:15       That's when I was just thinking like that place is going out of business, like everybody's fucking gone. It's such a funny situation. It's like this is what it's going to be like. That's what it's going to be like this. But it's funny to think like that. They're all playing the lottery so they can never see it

Speaker 6:          01:16:40       each other ever again. You know, these fucking guys, 11 of them

Speaker 2:          01:16:48       got that article said, every single one of them said they have no intention on quitting. Get Real. What do they come on? Like a financial services. I really love my job as a receptionist. I'm worth it

Speaker 6:          01:17:04       a million dollars now and I have no intention of leaving job as a

Speaker 2:          01:17:09       receptionist.

Speaker 9:          01:17:11       People really like going out to work and it's like, I know my mom is like that. Like on Saturday she can't in Israel, you go back to work on Sunday, so on Sunday that she can't wait for Sunday. Like I've never heard anyone. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:17:24       Say That your family have one day off. She says, well,

Speaker 9:          01:17:30       she always says I can't wait for Sunday. I want to go

Speaker 2:          01:17:32       serious. Yeah. Different, different alien race. What the hell sent you an alien right there. You think if your mom wants 29 million US dollars? She would work at Delta still. I feel like she would say that, but I wouldn't believe it. No effing way. These guys, I think they need to follow up with them in like two weeks off there be will be gone after the interview. Are you kidding me? What's that? Check hits the bank. Twenty $9 billion. Not what? Just really financially conservative. Take it easy. You got to conserve. Well, they have a option. All 11 of them have this option between they can receive 18 is this right? Then $18 million per year. Oh, one point. 6 million per year forever or a measly $29 million pop.

Speaker 2:          01:18:36       That's crazy. The one point six, take the lump. Take alumni lump all day long. Because I don't trust. Take the money and run inflation. Take the money and run. I don't want anyone owing me money. I take the loan every time I win the lotto. You know it's funny. By the way, I bought a ticket. I'm not ashamed to admit it. I bought four tickets. I dropped $10 on that. Why did they tons of tickets probably. They probably pulled in and bought a bunch, but think just like for they bought, they only like a handful of doesn't achieve bucks. Spent $10, bucks a piece. So 11 people, so 22 bucks. They probably had 11. That's a decent amount. Oh God, that's crazy. Have you guys ever played the lottery? You ever buy ticket and just fantasize? What if you were like a billionaire? Overnight? I never ever bought him. Really? My mom used to always do the same where she buy, when the lottery get big, she'd buy ticket and then for like the whole week she would just talk about fantasizing about the ball for the whole

Speaker 7:          01:20:08       week. Like I would move to Florida and I would do with the kitchen this way and like really extended fantasy,

Speaker 2:          01:20:21       started getting you excited and file maybe we are going to win.

Speaker 9:          01:20:24       My Dad used to own and kiosk and really I didn't know your dad was a key ops man and I don't know if you know and that is here, like if I got a gun. So they, they did a lottery there and I just remember all the old people going in there and like placing their bats and they're so serious about it. There's like combos and like I'll do the acs and the ACS Combo and I dunno, I ain't gonna even know what it means even though it's completely random. I know the people that when like they're doing their exam, you know, like they're all,

Speaker 2:          01:21:05       it's been three days since the seven weeks. First number on that. Can you imagine though that amount of money to win? It's so obscene. Half a billion dollars for literally doing nothing. It's hard to say no to that. That's where the Jackpot is so high because so many people in bond overnight, one of the richest people in the world. How does that differ from what are weird? That's how it works. They're just. They make money by people buying tickets makes the jackpot larger. It's actually the lawyer always one. Obviously the lottery, a lottery every night. Actually the lotteries, the interesting thing it was, I don't remember where I learned about this, but it was made to be a public service, so like it's like a voluntary tax. Literally that's how they thought about it and it originated in like Japan and so you will be like, give us a book, have a chance to win a prize, but the money goes to civic services, so like they use the lottery money to fund schools and local shit and that's still what they do today if you'd like. The California lottery is a. is a public fund used for the benefit? The welfare of the gut?

Speaker 7:          01:22:17       I don't know why I always thought it interesting. It's interesting. It's so like it's a California state lottery, so it's run by the APP.

Speaker 9:          01:22:32       It. I think it's the same. Well because I've seen like you'll see like an auditorium and it says the.

Speaker 2:          01:22:39       It's a voluntary tax is literally a voluntary tax. Pretty cool. Growing up, my dad always would tell me it's the idiot tax. That was another word, but then whenever the Jackpot was huge, like it was on this one, he would still go buy a ticket like that. Well, my brother explained it to me, Mr. Science. He goes, at a certain point when it gets so big, you're actually statistically

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       a favorable bet. You know what I mean? Let's say you have like a one in 10 million chance of winning and so usually let's say the price is 5 million bucks and you buy ticket, so that's not a statistically good. Say if you put a dollar and you stand the win half a billion, then all the sudden, yeah, yeah, maybe there's logic there. You can't win if you don't play Nice. Yeah. She didn't want one. Not No one wins. Nobody went, oh, I have a great video about the lottery. I want to watch with you guys. Well, there's another story I want to talk about. Just cracked me up.

Speaker 2:          01:23:49       Nela, almond breeze, almond breeze. You guys drink almond milk? Yeah. Well you'll be. You'll be horrified to know that it's being recalled because there's actually a trace amount of real book in it.

Speaker 7:          01:24:07       Even like some other day I was. I had a big old bowl of honey smacks, like the cereal that I never eat. I just picked it for some reason. I'm like, oh, I'll have honey smacks. And then like we're driving home from Milwaukee. I'm like this fucking crazy radio stations. Like on this goofy hip hop station, Dj fresh, fresh, just recalled honey smacks it. Has Salmonella and it like what the fuck? Like a sub plot from Salmonella funds to throw and be like, Oh, you thought I was going to Salmonella. No, but isn't that fucking hilarious? They're making all men milk a milk alternative and somehow real milk is slipping into how the hell does that happen? One mission to not have milk,

Speaker 2:          01:25:14       they're recalling 145,000 half gallons of almond milk because they could contain actual milk. Whoops. Why? There's no information about why actual milk got into the almond milk. I tried to dig into it and just nobody. Nobody has any excuse. It's like a great mystery. I just loved the idea of somebody going to buy almond milk because they're like a Vegan or something and there's just a trace amount of real milk. It just like a little prankster, like disgruntled worker. Just a little milk. It's like, that's not like a little mistake. That's like a fucking like a month of shit. How long does that go on? I Dunno know the recalling a lot of milk. And why does the almonds have to pay for the, you know, how many, how many defenses almonds are going down.

Speaker 3:          01:26:10       Jason was freaking out about the cereal. He thought they were like rubbing raw chicken on the serialized

Speaker 2:          01:26:18       cereal. Cereal wasn't a cook, but what touch like every piece of the cereal or like what? How dirty ass guy at the factory who probably takes a shit cooks chicken without washing his hands and he's handling the smacks just scooping him up like raw chicken goop in your smacks. Oh Man. I have a ton of videos to watch. Jesus. We're all over the place. We talked about our dinner plans.

Speaker 3:          01:26:48       Oh, by the way, thank you for reminding me. We're killing it.

Speaker 2:          01:26:53       I think I'll get steaks and we'll order fucking Mexican food. Going to be so good. We've got cookies. I've got to make cocktails. So you guys like Moscow Mules? Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:27:06       We just got the 10 guts. It's got breakfast, breeze

Speaker 2:          01:27:13       kind. They're all of a sudden. Oh, I'm sorry that I like to put artists in bread and wake up at five. Am You Isla? Sorry that I sound like a hipster while I'm literally sweating as the sun rises. Thank Leslie. As sleep peacefully. That is really hipster thing. Speaking of the light was really nice to wake up and have a fresh cookie. Have a smell of chocolate chip cookies, a wharf there up in the bar is going to expect that. It's a one day thing. You guys are the sweetest couple ever. Do you guys fight about anything ever?

Speaker 3:          01:28:01       They don't last. Like what? Do you guys fight about? Disagreements? Like stupid, stupid stuff. Yeah, but then we just like laugh. Like if we look at it, if we like make eye contact,

Speaker 2:          01:28:13       get like woke up like really serious. I go try to like look at each other, make

Speaker 3:          01:28:18       that's really doesn't just let it go and then it's over. Excuse me. That shit. Yeah. Maybe if we like separated and like went in separate rooms or something. We could have a bigger fight but we never want to fight more. We're working on. We went in. I like the idea of you guys had a fight. Like maybe if we. Jason, maybe if you went in that room and I go into. We could get angry at each other for a little longer. Yeah. Probably not even send each other texts like I'm hungry.

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       That's usually when they like, okay, I'm hungry. All right, let's, let's, let's squash this.

Speaker 2:          01:29:09       Beef menial. Always fight about food. Pretty much. Not Anymore. It used to be all we fought about like what you're telling her to eat or like where do you eat? Because Ila,

Speaker 9:          01:29:19       I don't know why we argue so much about it

Speaker 2:          01:29:22       because like it's hard. It's hard to tell.

Speaker 9:          01:29:25       I come from like, my mom usually cooks all the time, so growing up I only ate at home so I ate. I hate eating outside and

Speaker 7:          01:29:36       I up the opposite.

Speaker 2:          01:29:38       Okay. That's all right.

Speaker 9:          01:29:42       Ethan ate out like every time all day. Right. That's as I understand it the same. So that is why we would have a lot of

Speaker 2:          01:29:53       like I wanted to eat out. Yeah. You don't like eating out, you don't have anything else,

Speaker 9:          01:29:59       but we don't really argue about it and as much anymore

Speaker 2:          01:30:04       I've, I've learned to do at home. We did our. No, I'm kidding there. Check this out. Speaking to the lottery story is about a moment.

Speaker 7:          01:30:15       It was after barb reddick and her nephew, tyrone mcguinness, picked up their big win. One point $2,000,000 chase the age Jack Pot, but it didn't take long for things to turn sour when both were handed separate checks for $600,000.

Speaker 12:         01:30:30       JCA sweeteners is going to court. I've taken the car. That was my take was that I bought. I bought it and now he's trying to say we split. I said split with the 50 slash 50 now. But no chase ca's I've taken them to court and I'm getting my lawyer tomorrow.

Speaker 7:          01:30:49       Both names are on the winning tickets than a critic says. We agreed to split the consolation prize and not the Jackpot. If the ace was drawn,

Speaker 12:         01:30:58       I put his name on the thing. I told them for a good lock. They always lie, but I'm taking them to court. I'm serious. I'm getting a lawyer tomorrow. Who's name was tyrone you by the time I love it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:13       What is name for good luck and I won.

Speaker 7:          01:31:17       He works his name work. Do you got the good life? Like damn.

Speaker 2:          01:31:24       Get a little fucking money

Speaker 7:          01:31:26       instantly to. You always hear these stories of families falling apart over this, but like over the course of neither. There's not like 30 seconds later something else is going on with,

Speaker 9:          01:31:37       but if any, if it gives them money, how is he going to enjoy it? No,

Speaker 2:          01:31:41       he's out. He's fucking piece now. That's 600,000. What is she, by the way? This whole. I don't know where they live. Like I assume not anymore expensive. Like what is this lady going to do with 600,000 bucks and he's gone. She's gone on to make a plan. Take your. Yeah. For the last 20 years. Plans to. I guess you're right. Redo the kitchen. Could cost you anywhere. I thought this was interesting. Just like a couple bucks. That's a quick turnaround here. Why did you do that? Because he's like a son to me. He was like, Shit, you know, it's almost like she wishes she didn't win because then she'd almost rather that they didn't win and then that they were still like friends. Crazy. Like it's ruined her life. What are they going to do? It's like you just won $600,000, wouldn't you? Going in and out spend half of it on attorneys.

Speaker 2:          01:32:46       God, he'll get over it on the winning ticket. They felt the phone number was mckinnis. Britney's curly says when she called to notify the winters, no one answered, so she called the shape or good. It doesn't get better. You got all the good stuff. I mean, I've got some other stuff here, but we really blessed. We really spent a lot of time on the food. I don't have regrets. Tell me if you want to watch any of this stuff. We can wrap it up. Squash some stuff. But I've got Christian mom upset by north north. Have you seen that by one, by one with 10. That's an investment. Yeah. Yeah. It's an audit because I. It was kind of related to you writing your own hip hop song. It shouldn't do it. I kind of want to say. Okay, good. Alright, so I'm going to put on the person. Yeah. Oh the.

Speaker 13:         01:33:48       It's a little long. So bear with me.

Speaker 2:          01:33:50       The song by Vince staples called North North on the radio. By the way, that's a great song, but as far as hip hop songs go, it's really not the worst one. Not even close, man. He's got a message, right? So anyway, she's having like a mental breakdown that it was playing on the radio and the best she reads the whole lyrics to the song with the best part is that because she literally reads every single lyric, they were able to mix it up.
