Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Well, hello and thanks for joining us today on the broadcast. Today's episode is sponsored by candidate. Should I keep up with it now, Dan, even getting a note from Dan, today's video is sponsored by candid for Hims Quip and 23 and me now. Today we have with us bill wirtz, a musician, video producer, youtuber. What artists are mean? Artists, most certainly. How else is there any classification? I missed a person person. Let's not forget that. Species. Species. Animal. Yeah. How are you doing, Greg? Great. Having, you know, Jesus. Thank you. So thank you for having me. Thanks for. Thank you. How was the uh, how is it here in la? It rained, which is a typical, I suppose. I think it's kind of funny because it never rains in la. And your logo is the umbrella here. You come to Los Angeles and we brought the rain with you, which in La is a miracle, I would say.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       Yeah. So you are a miraculous young man who was very, very nice of you. Yeah. Um, our. Tell me about, I want to know about a. okay, well your first hit, your first big hit was the penthouse where you're, where you're looking in your timeline of working. What, what were your first year? People were like, oh, what's going on with bill works? Well, it's all relative, but here's the thing. It was like nobody, nobody, nothing until the going a million. My floor got about 200 likes very quickly on vine, which 200 compared to zero is like, that's like what's happening, right? Yeah. So, but after that it was um, school on fine, I don't want to go to school and it was shaving my piano and then it was a bench and then, I dunno. Do you know how people first found you online? Well, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       Um, yeah, I can tell you the first, uh, the first person, the first person who did it was a guy named Jack Doris Guitar Player, uh, his, he had a vine called, um, back back pain or pain back or something like that. But yeah, he was, he was a big fan and he just sort of, he just sorta, you know, gave me a thing, know the thing that's amazing that he just found you in the nether. Well he found me on twitter, so, uh, yeah. Um, yeah, no, but that was good. That was good. Uh, and then, and then more people did it and it was all from that first 200 likes, kind of like a steady climb. Yeah, I was Kinda like, yeah, I'd like to think that it was inevitable because your style is so unique and everything about like your editing and your, you have such a refined, specific style, so unique to you.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       I think it was inevitable destiny. It's very much that's very kind of, you know, metal that. I mean that's, that was the strategy. I was doing it for a long, long time, just like, I don't care. How long were you doing it before anybody noticed? Well, I started the five day schedule in early 2014, which was basically where I just snapped because before that it was like I wanted to do a million things and thought I could do anything but didn't know how to put it together. But finally somewhere along the line I just snapped and I just said, okay, we're doing five days a week video every day. He said, I'm just going to grind. I don't know what. I don't know how to figure out how to put all this stuff in my mind, so I'm just going to force myself to work, work, work, work, work.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       Yeah. And unfortunately they have to be very short if you do one every single day. So why did you decide to. What did you think the vine was the right medium? Well, that wasn't until. I didn't even know about vine yet. I was doing it on the website, actually just the website for the first month. They'll works.com. And then, um, someone told me, a friend said, oh, you're making videos, why don't you put them on Youtube? And I say I, I like, I like it when it's, when you get the file and you can just watch the file, like I don't really like streaming actually because I like to be able to pause it and horse it around and really see what you're dealing with. So. So yeah, I didn't really like youtube but, but he was like, well you know, you got to be on youtube so okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       So I did you to boot. So which is a pretty cool but I don't know him well. But you had your break on mine. That was probably, yeah, it was where things started and you were posting simultaneously to youtube and vine at the trick was I had already gone down to two week on youtube and then I discovered vine and I was like, that would be, would be great because you can't go longer so no one can be mad at, you know, so. And they loop. So the best way to watch short videos anyways to see him over and over again. But I figured so I put them there. I started putting them all there in order and I had to do a little bit of editing to square them and in some cases edit them down to six from, in some cases, 20 seconds down to six.

Speaker 1:          00:05:07       And that was kinda fun. But uh, yeah, I put it in there and I wasn't even going to touch them. And then I was doing twitter too, so I had decent following on twitter. Someone, someone found me, like I said it was, it was someone found me there and then. And then. Yeah. And so do you think that that has. So for this amount of time you're craning on vine doing a video five times a week. Do you feel like that was like a really important creative time in your life? Yeah, well unfortunately I was desperate to stop as soon as, as soon as it got going on, fine, because I already had like at that point I was doing two a week on youtube and then as soon as I discovered the vines started to do its thing, I was like, okay, well I got all of these on hand because I wasn't done uploading them all.

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       So then I said okay, I'm just going to. Well hold on. You had a back log? Yes, because I had, because it was like a year after year and a half after I'd started them five days a week that I started on vine. So you are grant the microwave? Yeah. So, so you were grinding and grinding and private and you had this incredible backlog of content. They wasn't private. It was on youtube. Okay. And it was on the website, but it hadn't reached a mass audience. So you were like, man, I've got like a whole library of content and you were getting followers before you even were forced to make new stuff on vine, but you were editing it down. Right? So I was. Yeah. So I figured I have these on hand, so I would edit them and release them one a day, so it was easy enough because I was doing two new ones and seven days a week I just figured since I have them I'll do 7:00 PM every single day.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       So and then I was like, okay, according to my calculations in two months I'm going to run out of content and I'm going to have to make a decision. I'm going to have to either put the vine thing down to two a week or accelerate everything to seven a week, which was even more than I was doing before. And this was after I was so sick of doing short videos, I could just cry and I was already thinking about doing much, much bigger things. I was thinking about history at that point, but. But now I'm stuck doing seven, seven short videos a week. And how important was it for you to have a schedule to really stick to it? Oh, it's, it's life or death really? Because if, because if you don't, you'll drown because you can do. It's infinite. You could spend infinite time then something.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       So wait, you're saying the schedule helps you escape the work or focused on the work. It helps you. It helps the thing get done. Yeah, because uh, because when we started we also for some reason had this idea that we got to post a video a week and we were so strict on that and I don't even know where he came from. We just had this, you mean back in the day? I think it was just a personal thing. It was like a, it's what kept me motivated and kept because like you said, you can focus forever on something. You at a certain point got to cut for so many reasons why I love the speed and the schedule. So many reasons. It's life or death. Well that's not true because some of them were done without a schedule and they need it to be. But when I'm off schedule, I get obsessed with schedules and I start watching behind the scenes a seinfeld documentaries behind the scenes and all of that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:07       Have you seen the south park one six days to air? I had a while ago. That's just incredible. I even get addicted to like how stressed out they get. I'm just like, no, not that. That's good. You romanticize that little I. Well, yeah. I mean I am. Whenever I'm not on a schedule, I get so obsessed with being on a schedule because it goes on forever. You can't. Especially. I mean if you're a perfectionist, I mean I'm kind of a raging perfectionist so you know there's there. Yeah, it'll go on forever. What was that quite? You've said you're a perfectionist and that sparked in me comment that Ila thought that she thought was wonderful and I was struck question because we have a question thread that we put on our separated people to submit questions for you and there was a question there. That was my favorite and it was how did you kill perfectionism?

Speaker 1:          00:08:54       Well, yeah, you can use a steam roller or a bulldozer. It becomes incredibly important to do that when you have it as badly as I do from. You're never going to get anywhere unless you have a serious strategy for steam rolling right over professional. So you start to do, there's one called a Monday good fire truck, which is like, that's probably, I think I hit the mark the best in terms of flattening perfectionism, just like, just just mash it. That satisfies you when you smash your perfection is if it means you can get something done instead of if not. Yeah. Yeah. And after you create a work, do you look back and see like, oh, I could have done this different or that different or that's in the past and it's time to move forward? No, no. Done. And you're happy? Yeah. I don't, I don't look interesting and so scary.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       The schedule defeats the perfectionism when you hit your schedule, that's it. Well, it doesn't impede the perfectionism, but it, it, it, it's like a tool to rags you along. Yeah. You know, you get beat up and cut, but you get there and you get stronger. Oh my God. The thing, speaking of which the vine, when I ran out of vines had to do them fast and then I was doing, um, started doing a history of Japan and so I flipped my schedule around and I started doing a history first in the earlier in the day and then just wait until the last two hours to do, to do the, to do the vine. It was crazy. I had some crazy times and I was, you know, I learned so many new tricks and techniques that I never would have learned if I didn't have to, you know, crunch down.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       Yeah. Is that because you're most productive in the morning? I like your strongest worth because you said you did the history in the morning and know the reason for that. I was trying to get ahead of the schedule with the, with the vines. Um, but that never works because the deadline is not there. So I would spend six hours doing one even though I thought I was going as fast as I can, but I wasn't. So I just said, okay, look, I need to get this history thing happening. Prioritize that as much as you can first and then about 4:00 or something. Just run for it and see what you can get on. Fine. You know how many hours a day do you work? It sounds you are incredibly productive. You are incredibly focused on your work. I can tell by the volume and just in your website and your work has so much detail and I mean how much do you do work and as much as possible how many hours as possible, but the problem is I know what you're going to say.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       You're going to say you got to take breaks and stuff. I was going to say that. Well, most people say that we have as much as possible, but the problem is when the problem is that when you work too much and then it starts fucking all of a sudden you can't get out of bed in the morning or if you have relationships or other things you want to do that you are, but if you like what you do and that's what gets you out of the bed, then work as much as you got them all. Please. Yeah, well I think I naturally tend to take a break even though I want to admit it sometimes, even if it's time crunched, crazy time crunch. Sometimes I'll just go face down into bed just for 20 minutes just because I can't even just face down but. But I can't.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       But yeah, I mean I know it's like, yeah, good to take breaks, but how long should the breakbeat and how often should the brakes? B, you never. Well, what are you doing? He'd say, well I don't admit it. I never admitted. That's the problem. I had that problem. My problem is that I'll spend all day working are all spend all day being busy, but then when I look back over the day I never took a break necessarily. Like where I'm like to step separate from my work, but somehow I was less productive than I thought I wasn't working the whole day. I don't know when I took breaks, I don't know. I don't know. I don't have a strategy for that really. But. Oh, but when the. When things take way too long as it is and, and you know, you, there's no time to lose, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       So yeah. I got to make sure. Do you have hobbies outside of a film and music? Luckily I've been able to sort of incorporate most of them. I'm trying to incorporate all of them into, you know, like anagrams. I mean I used to just integrate that shit is banana. I have to say I can't believe you. So bill, for context on his website, Bill Wirtz.com. Is that slash anagrams a no. A yes. No, that's right. That's right. Um, people submit sentences for you to Anagram and you'll unscramble it and make a new phrase. Is that eh? And some of them are really incredible. Maybe you can pull some examples up down that we can read it off. Real well. Got. Some of them are really inappropriate for, oh well, family shout out, saw the family watching, but they'll have to endure for some reason. It's, it's very tempting to make them.

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       Dan sent me something here. Let's say thank you for your recent purchase was the submission and bill turned it into try our corn cake funhouse therapy. And then another one, the joy of painting. Fight to enjoy pain. Now, what? That is incredible. That in your mind you can anagram. No it's not. It's not in my mind. You know, you can use computers now. Oh, so you use like a website though, a computer. I know people are going to say I'll use computers. A computer won't give you that. Look it along, like go get a really long uh, help me out here. But. So what? Well, what's your technique then? How do you go? Jeez, I don't know if I. can you. Oh, this is the match would never tell you. No, but you just gotta to. Okay, let's see. Let's see. Well if you have these in their need to find out where the V is going to go because otherwise it'll turn up leftover if you have, you know, you've got to take care of, you got to take care of that and then you just try some stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       And then also, you know, it's good. It's good if it relates to the thing, especially if it's a longer thing, so if you know, try to try to think of what words you're gonna need to relate and just take care of that. The long ones are fun because you can start out saying anything you want because the letters are going to be there and then you get down to the idea like, oh no, I have like a surprise, huge surplus of ends and start over and try to work some more ins and outs. And what is it about anagrams that fascinates you that that's a hobby of yours? Yeah. I started, I went to my friend's house at one point long time ago when he was rearranging scrabble tiles of just doing people's names and I was just for some reason, so I just went home and started doing it and I've been doing it ever since.

Speaker 1:          00:14:55       Well, I tend to do like the things that are in my life, like if I would get a job I would do the name of the job or did you know? And uh, yeah, I've just been something I've done for a long time and finally I was able to integrate it into the, into the science. I definitely noticed in your videos, in your lyrics are very much kind of script, you know, mixing up words and a lot of wordplay. Yeah. Do you, when you plan your videos, do you plan out like how meticulously do plan out and how much is it? I know you've like remix jazz and you're kind of a fan of or, or you have where you remixed gas, right? Oh I, there's a lot of like Coltrane and stuff. Yeah, it's just like jam jam sessions. It's like, it's like when it's like the way, I mean jazz in that sense.

Speaker 1:          00:15:38       It's like when a bunch of guys get together and read standards like out of the real book. So what happens to be, except it's just me. So what I mean is how much of it is improvised because it's, it seems somewhat random but very controlled. So when you're making a video, do you make up anything as you go or do mit or is it completely planned out? And then you execute the visual would be kind of as I go along, but in terms of what, in terms of the audience, in terms of the words melodies, the exact chords and the timing of all the, anything that's spoken or sung and the exact chords in the exact timing is all written. If that's written, everything else is just usually implied from there. And then I just fill in the space and the underscoring. Sorry, sorry to the underscoring music.

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       So the extra little instrumental stuff that goes in between when I'm speaking, that's all done after of that. Makes sense to, to sort of support. And so you, you do the music first, it sounds like the built around, not that music, but the, the, anything that's sung or spoken? I do that first. The underscoring music is done after. Interesting. We've had a long one here. Back to the anagrams here. Where does this start? Okay. Super Sonic game. Mega percussion. Where does it start? Cringe Poland's USS as long. It's not long. That's a short one for horizontal value that. That one I had. Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, step it up. Here's a law. If anyone's wondering if anyone's just wondering the answer to that point along his group is gruesome panics, use more spacing. It's escapism. You're gone. So you have choices.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       Some of them I do. So here we go. Here's a long one. I hope doing these anagrams provide you with an intellectual challenge. That's the submission and here's bill's answer. Guide me now as I get lunch, pray to religions and escape the hot lava and hell, that's it. That's incredible that you untangle that. Yeah. I think once you start, once you start doing them, you'll, you'll see a pattern. Well, no it's not, it's just you just start to find stuff. If you have a high standard, you know, you just have to just look and you know, once you start to get ones that are like that good, then you start to like really get excited. Is there anything interesting in the fact that like this, there's a whole sentence with the alternative meaning in that original one, is there something that fascinates you about just which one? Like you're writing a whole new thought just from the original one. Yeah. I wonder if that's a thread somehow throughout your work. I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:18:15       Let's Anagram that I can't do it right now. I'm so history of Japan when that came out. That was an incredible, incredible explosion. Yeah, so popular. Yeah. I mean right now I think it has 43 million views, but. But that's now. I mean I think it had something like just in the first week at like over 10 million views or something or even more. Maybe it was, yeah, probably about 10 maybe after a couple of weeks. So surely. You were just blown away by it. Yeah, because I was so tired of being stuck on a vine stuck under seven seconds. Like I said, I was desperate to. I was like, if only I could do this, I'm so in a way was a react because this was a really epic undertaking and this was a reaction to being like, I hate doing the small stuff. I want to do a huge.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       I didn't hate it. I loved it. And when I would sit down to write a bunch of new ones, I got really excited every time button I've, yeah, I really wanted to do something the same thing. So tell me how long did it take you to create that video? Fourteen weeks. Wow. That's incredible. Because on Youtube people do not. People spend one day, but it paid off in 14 weeks. My God. Tell me, how did you do you don't want to know how long history of the world took. I do want to um, um, how did you decide on Japan? Are you a fan of Japanese culture in any way? But I, I'm not an expert really. I mean I was during for temporarily, but I did. I wrote one for the United States much earlier because I wanted to do that. So you'll have this grip for us.

Speaker 1:          00:19:54       Never, never got finished. But um, and it was going really well, but it kind of, you know, I'd never done this before so I didn't really know it was kind of falling apart because it kind of, I knew too much about certain things. And so yeah, that didn't happen. But then, so when I came around to try it again, I said I got to pick something that I don't really know about interests so that I can just learn about it from beginning to end and then just spit it out so it won't be, you know, just as a challenge because if I can do that then I can do anything. So that was the idea. There's almost a nice quality too, I think in the end, the output when you don't know anything, like you said, you know, suit so much about USA. It kind of muddles I, yeah, I know too much about some aspects of not enough.

Speaker 1:          00:20:35       Yeah. And um, what is your research procedure like because you know so much about so many things, like all these little details, it seems so well researched and you've got timelines, characters. How do you, how do you lay that out? I don't entirely remember actually. I mean I did it very fast. It took a long time to make the video, but I was scrambling. So how much time on research alone, I can tell you that research and writing was kind of together because I would just learn a bunch of stuff and then write just. Right. I think that was about a week. I have the timeline. I posted the timeline somewhere. So yeah, something like that. Writing and research was about a week. And are you re your. I was always. I'm wondering, do you find people like nitpicking your facts? Of course. Does that bother you or you're just like and whatever?

Speaker 1:          00:21:26       Uh, yeah. No. Yes and no. I don't know. Yes, I did the best I could, you know? Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. And it is entertaining actually. I'm surprised at how few people do that. Okay. So that's your views and so many people. I mean I was really careful. I mean I'm obsessed with like geographical, um, accuracy. Like I saw Japan video that I was watching like to learn stuff and they had Kyoto really in the wrong place. It was a cartoon drawing and I was like, I know I'm just, I'm kind of obsessed with with that while it showed, it's when I watched that you're like, this is a guy that knows what he's talking about. It kind of has that vibe. So. But when you present yourself in that way, there's always people who are looking to like find one thing to nitpick, you know, I probably spend too long on those things where I put the stars on the, on the, on the cities, you know, I remember, I remember actually there was an early.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       I haven't seen that since it came out by the way, but I think there's an early point where I'm showing where all the old, like clans are or the old. So you haven't watched the video? I've not seen it since it came out. Why flashbacks? Flashbacks? Of what? Just the just. Yeah. I don't know. I don't watch videos after I make. I try no exception unless someone like forces me to, if I see it by accident, but what I was going to say is, yeah, I probably spend too long on those ones with the stars. Now when you say that you're like, you're kind of like that one was a millimeter like that one was. That one was difficult because it's like ancient clans and stuff like that are ancient ancient locations. Like one of them is called Hai Hai. How do you google that? Yeah, took a long time and there was one for history of the world where I showed like a million cities and I spent a long time getting the exact coordinates all for like half a second on screen, so I don't know what's wrong with me, but. Well, you know, whatever. And I think something's great. Yeah, thank you. Got It all backward.

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       I find it interesting that you don't watch that video back. I, I love it so much. That video is amazing. It's amazing. It's got to feel good help. Almost prolific. That video was how it kind of reverberated through culture. It wasn't just youtube, it was on reddit. It was online, it was everywhere. It was on television. I mean everybody does. You see it on regular television. I must have. I must have. I don't know, maybe it was. I don't know. I don't think it was. I think people, the way I remember it was people were watching it. I remember Black Joe Rogan was watching it and talking about it. It just was so prolific and it's influence. I mean, that's the mark of this insane quality that you brought to it that nobody really. None of your contemporaries are really doing. And I see you smiling. There was too kind, too kind.

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       Well, I think it's amazing. I think you're incredible. I think you're a gift. Oh Geez. Um, I love that part by the way. Um, when the nuke. Oh, Dan just founded on CNN. Bill, what's up now? CNN doesn't count. Is it on CNN? We have a clip on there. One of their youtube channel. Check it out later. Oh, he doesn't want to launch. CNN must've covered it at some point. I don't know where it's on television, baby. I love this moment. My favorite moment with the Hiroshima. He does this for those of you who haven't seen it, I mean mostly I'm sure all of you have history of Japan. When the US drops the bomb on Japan and the video is very manic, super fast paced. It's very dense and then all the sudden the bottom drops and it's just like. Yeah, and another one and it just gets quiet for a long time because of the manic nature of the video.

Speaker 1:          00:25:12       It makes that moment so powerful. It's been a long time getting that sound. I'm layering windy sound and the huge bass sound. Just really feel that explosion. A lot of layers in that. It's like a drum and then it's pitch pitch way down now. Was there you. You nailed that so beautifully. Did you read, was there something in your research like that informed that when you were just, you felt the gravity of that? I know that I don't, obviously it's heavy, but like I feel like there was a real expression there, a real empathy there. From what I heard, they dropped a bomb and destroy it a couple of like entire cities, so that's, that's a big deal. That's a big. Yeah. Yeah. That is a big deal. Well, I love that. And then you. You touched on it again in history of the world in a really beautiful way to.

Speaker 1:          00:26:07       What was it? They did a game. The game show thing. It's fun because I got to hit the same. It's kind of like back to the future to hit some of the same things, but do it a little bit differently. Yeah. Actually the most fun part was doing. We'd like the video game soundtrack music for, for that, for that section. You play video games. There's no time anymore. No time became a play. Now is the one game where I make videos so I. that's fun. Yeah. I guess if more people thought about life as a video game that might be more productive.

Again, 23andme.com/h three. Welcome back everybody here with Bill Wirtz. I want to ask you about history of the world I guess. But before that I am curious to ask you about. You have this very unique aesthetic style and to me as a video editor myself, I am captivated by your editing style. It's incredible. Um, how did, where did you, how did you develop that style? I don't know, I, I, I'm just trying to get, you know, be reasonable really. I mean I'm just trying to do it, do what needs to be done, you know, get the job done. And unfortunately it's the only way I can do it really. And some people say everything looks too much the same, which I don't know how I'm gonna avoid that because you know what, how is that the only way you can get it done?

Speaker 1:          00:36:05       Because it seems like there's a lot of effort that goes into the visual quality. Like you've got this kind of neon psychedelic and it's like multilayer. Well you know the are huge, right? You do all the art and the videos are a lot of most developments. Clip art. Right, right, right. Which is kind of. Well I got a graphics thing when doing history of the world because I wrote all this stuff about space and stars and then you're gonna have earth. Like what are you going to do? So I got kind of graphics tablet, so that's cool. Yeah, that's helpful. Too Bad. I can't really, you know, a long way to go there. But. No, no, it's great. I mean it's great. It's very specific style. But do what, what do you edit and can I ask that just as a, I'm, I'm a curious editor myself.

Speaker 1:          00:36:45       Well, I'll give you a hint, it's, I'm screwed and a lot of a lot of people are in or we're, I don't know if anyone's stayed screwed for this long. If you were to. Yeah, there was a popular program that was industry standard. I know long time at a certain. Yeah, at a certain point they made another one with the same name, but it's, oops, it's a different program. So. And I'm sure it's fine. Most people hated it. X Ten, whatever. Most people hated it when it came out. Then they bad mouth my trusted is going to be okay because the other option is the one that you have to pay every month and it's like, I can't do that. I don't want to do so. Um, so yeah, I trust that it's gonna be okay, I'm going to switch, but there's never a good time to relearn everything.

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       I know every week I learned a new thing on the thing that I'm using and I've had. I mean, if you want to know what it looked like, go back to the first Monday video on the five day schedule. I think it was about a Pelican or something and it's nothing. It's like text and nothing. Well, the truth is, I mean you are using what was considered industry standard. It's not even that. It is the light light version of that. Oh, it's missing. I don't know what, but I've never seen it. So I don't know what I mean. You got eight stuff. Oh yeah. The truth is, uh, I'm looking forward to switching but because like we added put me here and um, I feel like with every upgrade they've actually added some stuff that are. So sometimes they'll just break the software and that was a true.

Speaker 1:          00:38:15       Are saving so much time. Let's say a new mask. And do you know anything about final cut 10? Yeah, I know I used final cut but not 10. So that's the new one you have to pay for? Or is that the one that uses x? X is the one that x is what replaced. So which is what you're talking about. I've literally only met one person ever that liked X. everybody else. But we'll see. I've heard, I've heard the same rumors, but I have found at least two or three people that say, yes, it's fine, don't worry. It's getting better. It's getting better. They say they're adding back all the things and it's like the one I have is not even the one that you think I have. It's worth so you can do. You can do it on anything as long as you spend time with it and that's one of the reasons I don't like to go around saying what program it is going to know.

Speaker 1:          00:38:59       People are just eager to buy a thing and they think they're going to get a billboard that's a, that's an emulator. They won't get that. That and that's true of kind of any art craft. If you have like a sick guitar or an amazing computer or whatever is the tool that you use, you have to master your craft and here's another thing that helps. If you get really crazy software before you know how to use it, will it will ruin you and it. I mean I've been, I've been there, I've done that and. And you get frozen for for years, you just don't even touch the thing because you don't know what to do. So intimidating and not intuitive. Those, these programs are not intuitive at all. Well, they might be, but it takes time to learn. It's like a language, you know? Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, I think that's good. That's good advice for people who are trying to learn things is just get in there and do that first and then worry about the tools and just got to you. I just, you gotta use simpler tools. I mean you got to just use what you have used, what's available and you know, you'll go really far and then by the time you're ready to, you know, then one by one step by step you can get an upgrade.

Speaker 1:          00:40:01       But the. So did you develop this visual aesthetic with the title fonts that you use and all that? Is that something that you just started with or is that something you developed? I'm just trying to get by. Yeah. Yeah, it does develop over time if you want to see what it was. I mean, you know, go back to Monday, Pelicans or whatever the heck that was, nothing. And then gradually just a little bit more. And then when I started doing vines everyday really fast, it kind of accelerated. I mean, I just started learning all kinds of stuff. That's cool. Um, so let me ask you still learning stuff. I mean now I'm on a really tight schedule and I'm learning more and more and more. All good. I'm learning so much about editing. I was, I did what you said not to do and it was to my detriment because I learned how to edit on premier, which is like the industry standard on pcs and you when you don't know what you're doing and you don't know the right tools, it's, you're so freaking slow and it's taken so long to catch up.

Speaker 1:          00:40:58       Like I was working with an editor we had hired just a couple of months ago. Alex, sweet kid, great kid. I don't want to call him a kid that's like, he's a sweetheart. He's a great kid. Um, and he taught me like a couple of little key shortcuts that like changed my life. Like it's literally saves me hands up ours. Yeah. I have this crazy thing. I mean there's a lot of. And the thing I use, there's a lot of things that don't, don't have shortcuts that drives me crazy. But there's a trick, I use a on a Mac, if you could command question mark opens up the help menu and then you can type the first two or three letters of what you need. So it's like eight strokes but I do it anyway. Oh, you got to shortcut the shortcut. Yeah, I mean I have all this.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       Like I said, that's why I'm going to be so screwed if I have to switch because it's like I keep finding new little tricks and inventing new tricks. Or do you, when you edit, are you on the laptop or a computer or laptop and to use a mouse? No. Oh my God. I had a feeling, you know, I had one of those nights, I had one of those nice trackpads on the side, but the um, the batteries like leaked and it got the door that the battery door got stuck that a usual, I could not get it open and it was, it was like leaking acid and then I couldn't get the thing I have, I cannot edit on a laptop, you know, I met a man without a mouse. I mean the thought of that is unbelievable and it's a testament to your genius and dedication. But I will say if I were a genius, I'd probably get something better.

Speaker 1:          00:42:36       But again, the problem is we're all screwed because if you go to system higher than whatever the one high Sierra was the one where it officially stopped working. So what? The, the program doesn't work anymore and the new computers. So you're limited. But I'm going to. Well, I'll say this, you run. I knew a kid. You may not know anything I'm talking about, but it reminds me of this for all of you who have ever played world of warcraft or serious video game. Do you play video games? We'll work craft. Do you know about any of this stuff? I don't have time to do anything except make. Unfortunately it was a very intense video game that's played with a mouse and a keyboard and I have a friend who clocked thousands of hours, was in the highest level of rating of collaborating with 40 plus people, high level raids and I played with him a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       I was good friends with him and one day I went to his house and I saw this kid on a laptop without a mouse and I didn't know it was possible to do that and I was absolutely blown away. He was playing a high level game with a trackpad on a keyboard. It blew me away and I thought this man is a. he's incredible and I have this. I have this admiration for you. To edit without a mouse is truly a feat. It's probably not smart. It's probably not smart, but the desk that anyone who supports me on Patrion is going to get so mad because I, you know, because I'm not spending money on. I have a desk that is 10 years old and cost $10, probably 10 bucks. Where'd you get it? That was it. Convenience store pharmacies and those pharmacies. Now that you, that you and you bring up an interesting point, you are supported primarily through your Patrion, is that correct?

Speaker 1:          00:44:21       No, it's, it's a combination of, of, of things. Yeah. But that's a, that's a big piece of the puzzle. So patrion, by the way, if you guys want to support bill, put it in the scripture and Patrion.com/bill wirtz, right? Yeah. And I have to apologize for my lack of, of a social skills in tact and everything, but thank you to anyone who has. I've never, you know, my patron is blank is blank and I've never said, you know, it's like really promoted. No, no, but they are helping pay my rent essentially. So thank you for that. Well I think that's fair. When we were starting off, we had a patron, um, and we also had it blank because I don't, I think that's the point, right? Because they want you focusing on what you do and not necessarily trying to make gifts and not central for people.

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       I'm not sure that's how I saw it. I was just like, thank you for supporting me. We can continue to do what we do, which is apparently what you want more of. Right. So I think that's perfectly fine. I hope so and, and, and very reasonable because I didn't have one and everyone said know, Geez, why don't you just at least make one just so you know. So, you know, so yeah. But is it true that you turn off ads on your youtube video? Not entirely. I had them off for a long time and then I realized that if you want to get the red, uh, income from that you have to go the way they have it. Wow. Uncheck every box except for display ads, which is the one that puts a picture on the side. I still didn't want to do that for a long time because, uh, because when I see ads, like really when I see them, it really makes me uncomfortable and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:45:53       So really? Yeah. So, so, but I have that on there and I know, you know, you're going to be mad at me for not a lot of people are mad at me for not having the video pre roll video ads on like the history video, but I don't. I figure so. So you never really had a big payoff from those big, big Japan and history of the world did because through the other things, the youtube red stuff. No, through patron and there's paypal donate thing. Oh. So a lot of people responded at directly support. Yeah. Oh well God blessed. That's, I'm really happy to hear that. I think so yeah. Thanks to those people who are there. Um, I support you on Patrion you just did this morning. I good enough at it. You don't promote it as well. I figured you were just making money like the rest of us.

Speaker 1:          00:46:44       But here you are like working your ass off and amazing content. The thing is certain, I won't even mention the name, but certain web companies and stuff like I'm stalking me for the rest of my life through through targeted ads like interests and you know, and it's like I can't even, I can't put other peoples through that bother you that people follow you on the Internet trying to sell you shit. You have to becoming targeted ads and it's just really annoying. It's good strategy. Even though, and this might help you be at ease with putting ads on your videos, you have an option as a youtube creator to turn off targeted ad. That's true. That's true. I don't know if that helps you. It might because I do want you to prosper and to make money so I don't know, but that is that the primary reason you, you don't run ads on your videos, it's just a drag for the pure and plenty of people always tell me, no, it's not.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       People are saying, you know, no, it's not. You know, they say we don't mind, but they can't speak for everyone, some people. But do you do. What do you think about the fact that like everybody on the, um, how do you say the expected experience is that there's an ad there, you know, like television or any popular medium because how, how are you expected to provide for yourself? That's a good point because maybe the reason I haven't done it, I'm trying to psychoanalyze this because I really, I probably should, you should, I, I think you should. And so I know what it is. I remember when there were no ads on youtube. I don't know if you remember that, but youtube is like, there's no way they can't put ads on youtube. It's the Internet ads are for the TV. And then I remember the first day I saw an ad on youtube and I felt like the outrage, you know, so I guess it's been a long time since then, but I still, I guess youth that outrage lives.

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       Yeah. Even though maybe I shouldn't anymore, but look, but look at you, you are extremely hardworking, talented, your life, your work. As you say, I don't have time to do anything else because I'm working. So this is not just some dude posting vlogs are fucking around a hobby. I mean this is your life, this is your work. I mean you're entitled to get paid for that work. And, and in addition to Patrion, which is completely optional, if people can support you there. Oh. So it was an artist. You say like your work is your art and you put it up there for free and you know, like other artists sell their work so you put it out for free. So at least you could get money that way. Yeah. Okay. I'll turn it on.

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       Not to impress you. I say that for most things too, but it, it, it doesn't work that well nowadays because with the Internet you still have to one person and then they can send it to everybody else. Oh, you smelled like digital media. Well it's still music, but I mean it's also on the streaming sites. So there's paid for that I guess. I guess there's ads there, so technically there are ads so you know. But in the Internet, you know, it's like, it's kind of, you know, selling stuff on the Internet is kind of not entirely real good. I mean you can sell it to the first person. You could charge a billion dollars for the first one, but then once one person has it, they could, they could just send it to anyone. Well, what do you think about what Wu Tang did had that album that I was thinking that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       I mean that's, that's. Yeah, they did it. And as far as I know, nobody's heard that album at Martin Shkreli. Still. That's too bad. It is too bad to prison. He can't do anything with it now. It's probably an evidence been somewhere in prison. It list for them. I had heard that he had played a portion of it on a stream. Really. You know, I cannot believe that album was sold for only a million dollars. It's Wu Tang. Like how did nobody pay more than that? Martin Scarelli is the only guy who willing to shell out a milli for that. Yeah. You would think like someone like Jay z or you know, someone who's like really Wu Tang anyway, I still haven't figured out what it means, what it means to sell stuff on the Internet and what. No, because in the old. Yeah, I just looked it up and uh, apparently that album is now in the hands of the government and they seized his uncle because I wonder if they ever imagined their million dollar album would end up in the hands of the government of all people.

Speaker 1:          00:50:56       Maybe they'll add it to the library of Congress. Hey, there you go. They should. Sonia. That's so funny. So do you, what do you consider that? What, how do you consider that act by Wu Tang to have this one CD? Is that cool? Or is theoretically what I thought was a legit thing, but I still have not really figured out what I think about that. Because you want people to hear you. Do you want your work to be seen by as many people as possible? Exactly. So that's why you want to. Yeah, it's interesting and strength. Definitely. Interesting. But anyway, not to persuade you about the ad thing, I only am looking out for your best interest and I want you to prosper and I think you'd be surprised by how much that can then add to your, your, your quality of life for Christ sake.

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       Yeah, I might. I might do it. I mean, do you, do you have any idea how much money those two videos alone with it? It'd be a lot of people have deemed me on twitter. I mean hundreds of thousands. Well No. People have. I used to get dms on twitter saying we'll pay you. I won't tell you how much money, but we'll pay you this much money for you to just turn over the rights to the ads for those big viral hog. So funny. Like viral people that wanted to buy the ads, right? I don't know. Someone. Someone said we'll give you, you know, made a huge hugs and assuming no driver for, for just that ad sales. And have you had like sponsors reach out to you as well? Yeah. Any interesting people come in rolling through your email. Interesting opportunities. Yeah. Anything interesting that you're working on?

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       Things usually the most interesting ones have these long disclaimers at the end that says you can't talk about any of this. So. Okay. No, I'm not asking. You don't have to talk about it, but that's cool to know that you're cool. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah, that's exciting. I can't wait to find out whatever that is. Well I've, I've said no to a lot of most of them or save them or. I mean I'm notoriously bad at collaboration, collaboration kind. So. Well that's good. At least I was hoping that people would have recognized kind of what, what's going on with you and because I. well, what, what is your, um, what is your aspirations? Are you feel like you've arrived youtube or what is your dream? I'm going to take take over the world. Maybe take over the world. You want to be the dictator? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:53:34       I don't wanna do that. I don't know. You want to make a movie? You want to make a cartoon? You want to make an animated Alva hopefully something better. You know, thing, figure out what that is, you know? Interesting. Yeah, I would. I would freaking die to have like a history of like that as a show would be absolutely captivating. I want to do that to the problem and that's what I wanted to do. But the problem is it takes so long to make you will, you would work with people. Is that something? I know, I know that would be how to do it. You could have a team of 20 people. You can make one every month or I know you can make a whole 10 marks and they're already doing it. We already got a show. It's just slow. We don't get an episode every week about. Is that okay or would you be happy to see it accelerate? Is What? Okay. Oh the right now never was. That's why I. Yeah. Well it's been a wrong way. Ron, if you could, what? What's like the perfect rate of releasing those in your ideal world history videos? Yeah. Once a week.

Speaker 1:          00:54:36       Is that enough time to do all the research? Here's the problem. Then I did the entire world just because I figured let's escalate, how do we see Japan and after doing that I don't, I look, I'm really interested in history or I was. I mean I'm really like really, you know, and after doing that, like I don't want to say another word about history African. Oh really? Yeah. So you don't want to make the history series. I did. It was the only thing I wanted to do for a long time and then I did. I just did the entire world. Not that I accept everything in that. In fact that was the most painful part was because the more you learn, the more you find out how much you're going to have to leave out. It's like 99 percent you have to worry about and you know.

Speaker 1:          00:55:16       Yeah. That was painful. But I assume so. Are you not working on a, another history video right now? No, not right now. No. I'm doing songs like every. Is there some longterm project and the background that you're working on? No, but I think there's about to be. Oh yeah, because I just got to the. Yeah, I think there's about to be, you found a topic or something that fascinates you or you don't? Um, yeah, I can't. Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah. Well I know that every, everybody loves, everything you put out is adored, but those, those specific works or just like, I mean they're modern masterpieces and I think everybody just can't get enough of that anymore. Just a masterpiece. You cannot get people on Youtube. To what, how long has the history of the world? It's like for like 19. I was hoping it would be five because I didn't have time to take another three months off, you know, so I was like, okay, five years, five to seven.

Speaker 1:          00:56:12       And then I was writing, I was writing it after two months I was still writing, not making the video. I was researching writing after three months and it's at 12 minutes and it's like reading at 14. Yeah, it's just, you gotta turn the adds on to. So how long did it take you? Total will be 11 months. Wow. Yeah, we're at, I don't recall. Were you gone during that whole time? Just like, what do you mean? Were you posting videos? No, I was like, it wasn't done. But I mean on your youtube channel you hadn't posted? No, there was nothing. Oh Wow. Yeah, it was rough. Every single day you wake up to like everyone's saying pressure and like gone from the. Yeah. But you came back big time. Well, I never left when you posted. Well, I mean in the end, the mental collective of the world, so to speak. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       So let's move on to the history of the world then because that video now if I see that video, uh, the history of the world I guess has 55 million views and sits on our videos number two of all time with 176,000 up votes. Do you use reddit? No, not really. But do you understand? Kind of. Yeah, I know what I mean. How nuts that is. So when you posted that video, what was your expectation for the reception? Well it was, I knew Japan did that. It was number one and read it and all that stuff. So I was like, okay, this could end. It's a huge escalation from the Japan video. It's like the ultimate thing, so I was like, okay, this could really get there, but you just can never get it. You can never. Which is scary. I've been working on this for a year since I was thinking at the end of it I was like, I never want to spend this long on a thing again.

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       It's scary. I'm very thankful that it came through and it, it, it did, it did as well. So what was that like for you when you finally. That must have been such a relief or relief. Somebody told me, somebody texted me and they said it's number one year. It's number one thing. I was just really. Because I spend that long, you know, you don't want. And Are you happy with how it came out? That video? Yeah, I guess. I mean I'm, I haven't watched it since it came out, so I think it's okay. There's plenty of things that are just way under cooked. I mean look, it went through like within the first four months and something that I started working on the graphics and stuff like that. I was, I mean I must have spent all day looking for images of different like apes and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       I must have spent all day looking at apes and finding that perfect clip art. Yeah. And then I was like, what am I doing? It occurred to me that this is going to take multiple years to finish if I don't seriously kick myself faster every day. So it really just became again and again and again. I had to just pick myself up and just go faster. That kind of goes back to the whole issue of deadlines because you're such a perfectionist. When you remove that deadline it can probably drive you crazy. Yeah, I mean, but you know, I mean around October I set a deadline of December. First I was like, this has got to get somebody. During October, November I was kicking ass. I was like, dude, working so fast, but it came around to December and I wasn't nearly done and then I just couldn't get out of bed for a few days.

Speaker 1:          00:59:17       It was just too much, by the way. It didn't get done to me. What you said you couldn't get out of bed. You mean you were just despair. Just like working so hard. I was just like, I needed a break because you're, you're. Are you up to the point of like you're not even sleeping that much there? I do sleep. I sleep good sleep. How much sleep you sleep? I sleep 10 hours a, it'll be like nine or 10. Yeah. God bless you. Unless now I'm on a schedule and unfortunately toward the end of the schedule it gets ridiculous toward the deadline. It gets you set an alarm clock. No, God bless you to do. I know. I don't know if for me be the one joy being self employed is not setting an alarm clock. I mean that's, that's all that matters for me. Problem is I tend to drift telling you personal things, but uh, by sleep schedule drifts forward like an average, about an hour a day. Like on average you would like rotating. So you sometimes wake up at like 3:00 AM. Well, anytime it'll, it'll, it'll keep drifting. If I don't have to, if I don't have to work for anybody else, you know, it'll, it'll gradually drift. So what's your sleep schedule that like right now?

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       Right now I woke up early. You're on the early one, but I mean I just released the. Well yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's weird. It's. I got it. I got enough sleep though and um, I find that so interesting. So

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       do you find yourself more productive at a certain time of day or is it all just rotating? It's all a blur. It doesn't matter that much. What time it is kind of food do you like? Oh, I don't know. You order. I would cleared. Food is weird. I don't like to talk about food. You don't like talking about food. Food is weird, man. Not that interferes. Food is weird. It is weird. The whole thing go eating thing. It's just a weird thing. No, it's good. And we all, I think we all think we all do it. We, I mean certainly that is a requirement. I have to. I think I read a book that says we all do. We all do it. It is pretty weird though. I don't find it. That's strange. I love food. You can tell by looking at me. I'll eat all day and he was pregnant and she's.

Speaker 1:          01:01:15       We can, we can not talk about food. I mean I don't have that much to say about it unfortunately. That's interesting though. Isla doesn't really love food, but she's pregnant now and she's turned into like a, I want to say beast mode, which I love. I don't. I mean that is an absolute compliment because I'm a monster and she hardly eats so now for the past three nights in a row, we've had pizza at midnight last night I was eating pizza with the and I was like, this is the happiest I've ever been. It really did say that. I usually each their own. Yeah. I usually don't care about pizza, but you don't have a preference. You don't like specific foods. Pizza. It's okay. I didn't realize how some reason. I don't really like to talk about food. I don't know why he lists that way. What about, are you a coffee drinker?

Speaker 1:          01:02:11       Ice, ice cold? I just really don't like to. I really don't like to talk about preferences of like what, okay, what different people leader or at least for me sound like to talk about it. Okay. So let me. But I will say that. Um, yeah, hot coffee. I just can't, I can't, it, it's, it's, it, it burns me physically. You're sensitive to the temperature. Yeah. Interesting. Like, I dunno, I just drink it and you're like, oh no, I'm burnt. Doesn't burn. Like for the few days as well. My brother's very temperature sensitive. He kept. Yeah, he, he, he can't eat like until it's like lukewarm at a hottest. Has this explosion in popularity since these last two videos, do you get recognized on the street ever? Well, I mean, uh, I mean, sorry of those, those big too, I feel like really put true. Yeah. Do you get recognized on the street ever? Does that happen to you?

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       Maybe it does happen sometimes. And do you um, has this popularity affected your life in any way or you feel like everything's the same? It's weirdly the same. Right? Because before I had it, I was pretending that I did. It's just convenient because now I don't have to change a damn thing. That's interesting. When I was posting five times a week on the website and I had it all like that, you know, I didn't even tell anyone that I was doing that and I was just carrying on, like pretending that it was really important and they do have a day job. What was life like before you were making money from your art?

Speaker 1:          01:03:48       Like music stuff, you know? Oh, music stuff like gigs and stuff. It's various things, you know. Cool. Yeah. God bless 'em. I'm just wondering, have you gone to you seem, are you classically trained with music? I sort of know. Uh, no, but I figured out sort of through the grapevine, like the names of stuff, like the names of the notes in the chord self-trained oh yeah. Completely. Really? Yeah. And what, what was your first instrument? The keyboard? It was piano and drums and piano. Back to drums and piano. Interesting. Who are your music inspirations? What kind of music do you like? Oh God, I don't know. But you have a very specific style and you know, and you know, that's, that's unfortunate because, you know, I, I wish I could, I'm just trying to do, do whatever I can, you know, you know, it's like if you have a green tractor and if that's the one you have people say, why do you like to drive?

Speaker 1:          01:04:56       I want to have, you know. Do you listen to music though? Because yeah. Your whole life. Is Music Your Music Ira? It is. What are you listening to these days? Unfortunately there's not that much time. But you have a favorite artist? No, I don't. I don't break it down like the Beatles. Well I don't even like really break it down by artists because it's every single artist is going to have stuff that I really love and that I don't like. And I think it's that way with everyone. Maybe it's not even by song, by Song. There's parts of the song that I love, parts of it that I don't even individual moments of songs. Wow. Parts of it that I don't think I can do and don't it. So he's funny. That's funny. That reminds me of kind of what Jason Donkey said. He does this, this blew me away.

Speaker 1:          01:05:39       He says he'll take songs that he loves and cut out the parts he likes and cut out the part that doesn't like and then make a cut of his perfect idea. In that Song I've done that really changed the billing to a. I cut up the bridge to pretty woman and changed it. Pretty Woman Roy orbison. Great tune. For some reason the bridge just it takes this detour that really bores the hell out of me. So I just changed it without adding anything new. I just took the meat part and I pitched it up a whole step and another whole step and comes back around. Were you always interested in music or was that kind of, you know, keeps coming back. I think by the time I was about 10 and I was just like, it was just one of those things that kept coming back.

Speaker 1:          01:06:19       I was like, oh, I better do this then. Yeah. Is there, is there an artist or band or style where you think like that's like, what was it? Was there something you ever heard as a child or whatever where it was kind of transformed when you're like, I want to make music because this is just so brilliant. Yeah, it was probably a bunch of stuff. I don't remember exactly. I don't know. Can you hear those? There's, there's sirens outside. The soundproofing can only do so much. It was actually a window behind that foam Paul Desmond sacks plan on, on take five. It's a very famous tune. I mean, he does a nice job on that. That's real good. I mean, I heard that at a young age. Feel good. So that's jazz. I don't know. Yeah, sure. Dave Brubeck. There you go. Um, people. Uh, but yeah, I know.

Speaker 1:          01:07:09       I don't know. That's a weird thing to talk about. Now people are gonna think. Well, I don't know. It's all good. You don't? Nope. No pressure. I don't know why I'm so weird. No, you don't. I get the sense you don't like talking about your musical inspirations. Well that's not true, but I'm a little confused about what you like or what about what you want to say. Yeah. I'm not sure. I haven't figured it out yet, but one thing that I will always come back to again and again is popular music can't get away from it. Really can't ignore it. You loved pop music. I refuse to hate it unconditionally, which I think it seems like everyone around is always doing it and I can't. I, I will. I think. I think that's a wise way because clearly there's something there that people find irresistible.

Speaker 1:          01:07:58       Sure. At pop music, you're right. As, as always, from the times of like what I was a kid like backstreet boys and Brittany Spears or whatever's popular. The reaction of everyone is always to be like everyone was cool. Yeah. But then you start finding these articles and now on youtube, you know, you can see interviews from 1955 from 1925 from a, you know, for any given year in the past. Everyone's always trying to say that nothing's good nowadays and that the latest technology has ruined everything. Right? Once you see how prevalent that viewpoint is at every single moment in history, suddenly you just can't take it seriously anymore. You know? Why would it be true now if it wasn't true then that's really, that's a really great option. So it's just I have, I have no patience anymore for, for, for the pop, the unconditional pop hate.

Speaker 1:          01:08:47       Thanks. That's a great great. And I'm not saying I like every tune that's ever on the radio, but man, every given your and everyone has different tastes but any given year if you just check out the charts, there's at least a handful of tunes that are just like here, you know, I, I know and it'll be different ones for different people and maybe some people like none of them. That's fine. Maybe, maybe that's true, but I just think it, it just never. It never stops, you know, 2014, 2000, one, 19, 52. I mean sometimes I go to, there's a charts website where you can just listen to stuff and you'll hear, you'll hear good stuff and you'll hear people that are copying their neighbors, just trying to sneak in there and that's always there too. And that's cool. I don't know. I think that's really wise and reminds me, the best example of that that I always hear is like Bob Dylan, when he switched to electric, everybody was like, uh, it's so poppy and it's not authentic, and everyone was saying that he was a hack and it was making pop music because he switched the electric guitar.

Speaker 1:          01:09:46       Maybe you could say that about Bob Dylan. You can't say that about anyone is, do have a artist today that you like a pop artist that you're a fan of. Can't really. I can't really, you don't like naming. I can't really say, you know, there's so many things were and I don't even pay attention anymore. Like, because there's, there's certain songs where I'm like, yeah, I love that song. And I was. But I don't even think about whether or not it happens to be by the same person of another song that I can't stand. I just don't even notice anymore. I don't even. Interesting. I don't know. Um, I would say when I look at your style, I will consider to be almost psychedelic. Do A. is that an influence on you at all? No, not, not physically, not physically, no. But you know what it was.

Speaker 1:          01:10:34       What do you mean? Do you take academic? No, I've never. I've never done. Yeah, no, I, we were talking about this backstage. You kind of are, you have this frank Zappa kind of vibe. I think about you with this, like really excentric brilliant music and you, you may know about for example, is that he was very much not a drug user. He was very sober, in fact, to the point of even expelling people from his band for using drugs and that was during the sixties and seventies when, when everybody was on drugs and I, he was one of the most eccentric and creative musicians from that time period. Do you, uh, relate to that? But I wouldn't do. I mean, I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't kick people off the bat unless it was like messing up. Yeah. You're like, dude, you're not good at or not shown up to the Gig.

Speaker 1:          01:11:23       Yeah. Do you play in bands? Do you play music with other people? Right now? I just. Do, I just do solo? Yeah. Because you're very much a one man band, as I understand from watching your videos. Yeah, but the. But the live, the live show is going to be a band for sure. Oh, we got a live show, but the thing. No, but the thing is it's going to be. It's going to be a. It was just going to be a band. Tell me about this live show. What's. What is this? It's not happening. It's not happening yet. But you're planning. Yeah. Well No, I'm not for it yet, but I'm planning to plan. You're planning the planet. Yeah. It's in the word. And so I'm very curious about this. I think a lot of people are. This is a tour that you want to do.

Speaker 1:          01:12:01       Well, like I said, I'm not planning it, but I'm planning to planet. Okay. So you haven't got that far. No. And the problem is, but while I'm doing it, I can't make a new any new songs or videos, but it can be a lucrative. Does that to you? It does money. Does money motivate you at all? Well, it doesn't change. I hope it doesn't change what I do or like how I do it. So. No, I mean, yeah, I mean I need it. You need it. I need some of it. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. Are you, you don't care about being a millionaire. I think you just want to keep doing what you do. Well, that'd be convenient. It'd be nice. Well, touring will be very lucrative. I don't know if you want to do it like that and putting ads on would also be very liquid dude. You would be making it. I'll do it. I'm telling you, you're going to text me and be like, thank you dude. I'll have to text the million people, other, other people who told you to get started first. I think the only one. But can I take credit for having convinced you? Because this I feel like. No because you didn't convince me. I'm not going to do it. I'm just saying that could get you off my back basically. Fair enough.

Speaker 1:          01:13:10       Okay, fair enough. That's cool. It's a good. Honestly, it's a smart idea. I probably should do it. Well. Um, let me see here. Oh, you won that. You won the shorty award? Yeah. How was that experience for you? Because you went up there and just drive her to thank you and you bounced out. It was too weird. What was weird about it? Well, it's kind of alarming how bad my social skills are. Like when I go to a place like, it knocked me out. Like I didn't even expect, you know, I went to, I got invited this vip find party thing and it was like I walked in and I walked right out. You just walked in and did a one. I did. It was like at a bar with ping pong and stuff and it was like a kindergarten flashback because it felt like the whole room was already talking and already knew each other and I'm just like, wow, there's never a good time to interrupt someone and awkward for everyone. I think socializing, I think we all need to acknowledge how weird socializing is. It's so hard. Hey, hey guys, playing ping pong, can I get next game?

Speaker 1:          01:14:18       We've never gone to one of those events for the same reasons I avoid. Yeah. But, um, did, uh, what, you're alarmed by how bad your social skills are. I'm just surprised because you have like social anxiety. No, no, it's just I have no, there's nowhere to anything. Once I'm in a conversation, it's cool. As long as there's something to talk about. I was like, yeah, it's starting to get that foot in the door. Yeah. So I pretty much had those things. I just literally get a beer and stand somewhere in the corner, just really. And people approach me because they recognize me. So that was convenient. That's nice. Very nice. And tell me about the award ceremony. Did you ever play ping pong, by the way? Did you get a game? Do you play Ping Pong? I don't know. Oh No, no, I don't, you know, let them go.

Speaker 1:          01:15:06       It's not that big of a deal. Yeah, it's not that hard. It's not really that big. We could actually is probably pretty hard. It's hard to be good at like forrest gump. Good. That's hard. Yeah. Um, but it's, but pink box really not that serious. Um, how was it accepting the award? Because I was watching you. Had you, you had this great little video you put I guess on your website, but you never posted on, on Youtube. Maybe it was on vine about you being like, I went up and I told her keep the door open because I'm going to be fast. That was when I explained pretty much half of what I just explained actually. Yeah. Yeah. Um, tell me about that acceptance. What will you had a strategy where you planning on that quick thank you. Yeah, I, it was a, it was an option.

Speaker 1:          01:15:48       It wasn't authentic, you know, because I saw, like I said, I saw Andre 3000 doing it at the grammy's. He had a very strong effect on me for some reason, but it's not, it's not rocket science and he's not the first person who's done that. I'm surprised more people haven't done that. Well what more needs to be said. Probably some more things could have been said, but I just didn't, I just didn't have it and it was just, you know, like the ceremony was going on and on and everyone's like thanking, thanking their manager's manager and their social media manager and all this stuff. I'd never heard of him. Okay. But the detail of that story that I love was that you're walking up to the stage to accept the award and you and there's a girl who's got her arm on the door that you are planning in your head ahead.

Speaker 1:          01:16:30       You says, I don't want to be awkwardly waiting for her to open the door for me. So he says to her as he's going to his, he says, I'll be quick. So keep the door. I wanted her to be, to have the door right here. That was pretty slick. I love the that we can see your thing. Right. And the footage that was you show, you'd be like that door now. Where was that something you were planning while you were in the audience being like, if I win, I don't want to be standing there awkwardly. A brooding over this I, yeah, I, I, I, yeah, I know I was going to do as soon as I walked into the theater, I knew I was going to just because I was all the way in the back to this is we're just talking about how, you know, antisocial and basically that's okay.

Speaker 1:          01:17:14       Okay. I, I, I find it charming. Yeah. I mean it's, it's genuine. Um, I, I am very, hey, feel like I have social anxiety. I feel like I need to draw stuff. I saw Al Williams interview where he was just like doodling stuff while he was interviewing because I just couldn't deal with it. He's like, he was like, thank you for interviewing me. I know I need to do interviews and it's totally cool, but just forgive me. I just have to just A. Do you feel that way? Is that, do you want something to draw? No. Do you feel that way? And that's like you don't want to do interviews but you feel like at some point you have to. Yeah, probably. Yeah. Is this confronting and kind of like a, I don't know if it's a fear but like a necessity of you being here?

Speaker 1:          01:17:54       Yeah. Well it's fun to, you know, so cool. I mean I love, I love having the opportunity to speak to your logo is the umbrella. What's the significance of that? Well this is what happened really. I was doing, I didn't on my website, I had no logo, I didn't really want one. So, but then I was setting up the youtube channel and so was setting up the banner, so had the black background and it says hi, I think it still says to this day said hi or something. So that was cool. And then, and then the, the, there's a thing in the corner where the, there's a thing you have to put in the corner. So I was like okay, well you got to put something there. So I just, I just put, I did it based on what was already there. So the high thing there.

Speaker 1:          01:18:36       So yeah, I just picked what would look good and then I realized that that's actually gonna be the thing that shows up as my thing, which was a surprise to me. I didn't know. I just thought it was something was going to go in the corner. But you're happy with the umbrella? Yeah, it's okay. And I try to use a different color when I go to each different platform. Um, do you have pet peeves or things that annoy you and pee, Pee, pee? No, I, uh, uh, I dunno probably do, but I can't think of them right now. Uh, what keeps you up at night? Um, I dunno. Um, Geez. I don't know. I don't have answers to these. What gives you the most hope in the world? This is, you have a list. Don't twist Sanya whole list. Yeah, I have a list. Well, when I was doing the history of the world research, I sort of, I already knew this, but I sort sort of solidified in my mind even more was like the way progress and discovery and things getting crazier happens all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:19:42       You know, like it was just rocks for like billions of years and then something more interesting and that it was for a long time and then then something gets discovered and then like, you know, so and that's been happening forever and faster and faster. But do you think about the future in regards to that stuff? Are you interested in like robotics and computer science and space and all that stuff? Yeah, it's probably going to get really crazy, really fast. Are you a fan of Elon Musk? Do you follow all that space x stuff and Tesla? I think he's pretty cool, but I understand there's some, I dunno. Yeah, I dunno. Do you? I love him. I love Elon Musk. I love Elon Musk because I feel like he's a. here's a guy who is fabulously rich. He is one of the richest people in the world and he uses his wealth and his influence and his intellect, in my opinion, for the betterment of mankind, and he and he has to do in a way that's profitable obviously, because how can you, but space x, which is basically just fueling his fantasy of starting a colony on Mars, nearly bankrupted him as did Tesla.

Speaker 1:          01:20:52       The guy's been on the verge of bankruptcy from gambling. Everything. He's got his billions is vast wealth on these insane ideas that everybody said was impossible. Having a private company that sends a rockets and outer space, who would ever do that except the government, uh, making electric cars, zero gas with batteries, efficient enough to take you through. And German people said that was impossible. I love him. He's incredible. Love Him. He's pretty cool. I don't know enough to really. He's amazing. But I, I'm fascinated by the rapid increase in Texas. I didn't even know. I didn't even really. I feel like I didn't really explain what I was trying to say. You said what? What am I hope that gives you hope? Yeah, I don't know. I have it, but I don't know where it comes from. Oh, you. You feel like you're a naturally optimistic?

Speaker 1:          01:21:39       Hell yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. God, I wish I had that. I feel like I'm painfully centered, cynical. Do you think I'm painfully cynical? You know, not all the time. Thank God. But you feel like you wake up generally have a sunny disposition. You're happy. No, no. I've been worse morning. Anyone does. I have morning anxiety I think. Yeah. No, I have crazy morning anxiety. So what does that mean? Morning anxiety when you wake up and you'd have crazy anxiety just because of like, of, of what? What are you anxious about or is it just a general feeling? So this show this morning. Well I don't blame you for that. I mean it's a new experience for you, like what you have to do that day, things like that. I just. Yeah, I think so. And when you have that eye opener, you know [inaudible]. Yeah. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:22:25       I want you to get into your work. You feel more comfortable? Yeah. Once I figured out what I'm doing and it's cool. I feel like that's most people. It might be, I almost wouldn't trust someone who would tell me they just wake up happy and so pink. Yeah. Oh, thank God I'm alive. That's kind of how you should be. Right. That somehow we're not maybe think, God, what a day of wonder. That's like all those self help gurus are like every morning I'm blessed that I'm away. I think if you really care about doing really good stuff and good work and really care about making stuff good, there's to be a flip side of the coin because you're going to get really paranoid that it's not going to kind of have to a little bit and hopefully it doesn't kill you. You know what I mean? It doesn't kill you. Do you believe in Ufos or ghosts or do you subscribe to any. What would be considered as conspiracy theories?

Speaker 1:          01:23:24       Ghosts? You know, I thought ghosts were pretty cool and I looked into some things. I found like some lists of all the most famous ghost sightings and stuff. I was kinda disappointed. Most of them were not very believable. I thought I was going to find some really believable stuff. I've heard some stories from people I know that are very believable, so I agree. Whenever I look into the ghost stuff because I am, I'm happy to accept a naturally skeptical person, but I agree with the. The evidence is not compelling yet as of yet. I thought I was. I was expecting to find it, but I didn't use it yet. What about Ufos and aliens? Do you think aliens are out there? Well, I think alien just means someone from a different planet than yours. So I think depending on which planet you're on, the other person would be.

Speaker 1:          01:24:14       Do you think there's interplanetary beings that. Do you think there's things on other planets? Of course. And do you think they visited the earth? I don't know about that. Maybe they have, but the thing is no, I don't know. You think there's intelligent cultural beings out in the universe? Yeah, there would have to be, but. But here's the thing though, where we're going. How long have we been? How long have we been here? Really like zero time. This is one of the things I was talking about, things that are like going super fast, like we're here and we're, I mean I don't know what the future is. We'll either maybe be extinct or maybe we'll invent an entire way out of this entire paradigm somehow or, or invent our way off of this planet or something. I mean like, so the chances that I don't know what I'm trying to say.

Speaker 1:          01:24:59       The chances that there's another, like that word, the only one what, what, what you're. Or what I think is that the chances that we're the only ones here cooking on this planet. It's like lower than the chances that there's other intelligent cultural beings on other planets. I would think they would have to be, but there might to be right. It might be pretty quick. It might be pretty temporary and pretty quick before they like, well, what fascinates me about our time on earth is that it took a while to cook us up like and on earth has been around for a long time and the dinosaurs were cool. They were dealt but they weren't really going anywhere with science and shit like that. So the media was like, alright, you know, hard, hard, reset that let's throw out the leftovers and start over and so I wonder how many hard resets before you get someone that can build a spaceship or build a computer or something, you know? Yeah. Didn't take that many. Only like to, for us to come pop out of there too. There was like a several mass extinctions. Right, right. There were like five. So five resets it took. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       Huh.

Speaker 1:          01:26:06       I'm sorry I'm not more of an expert so I feel like I'm letting you down. You're not letting me down. Um, I think I was an expert while I was making the history of the worldview. There's new stuff in your head now. Yeah. Yeah. I think Elan Musk believes were living in a, an, a, a simulation of what he thinks that we are living in a computer simulation of something else entirely. That reality is just a computer simulation

Speaker 2:          01:26:40       of

Speaker 1:          01:26:42       I guess. I guess that would mean that someone else's control, someone else is controlling it for some reason. Like if you think of like, okay, whatever. Yeah. All right. Well I'm excited for your live show your concert. That's for there isn't there? Isn't one yet. I'm excited about the idea for the idea that you're entertaining. The idea is ecstatic to me. I really want to do it now. The problem is that I can't make videos at the same time, so I don't know how I'm going to say.
