Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Welcome everybody to the premiere experience and the podcasting world, the age three podcast experience. All other experiences are lesser to our own. This is the premier experience. Today's episode is sponsored by stitch fix meant dimmable and empty empty movement. I am Ethan Klein. You're a grand wizard host of loneliness. Last week I was the wizard of loneliness. Isla was supposed to be back this week. She had to delay her return by another 10 days or so. So I've taken on the title of grant wizard of Loneliness, um, not to do with the Klu Klux Klan, by the way, just my loneliness. Uh, I will talk more about Ella's extended trip. It is quite a sad and unfortunate, so I will save that for the end of the show. Uh, and I'm not going to lie to you guys. I'm not wearing underwear today. He has been gone for three weeks. I've never been away from her for this long. She's finally coming back on Wednesday. Ila, please come home. I come almost completely. I'm out of underwear. I have no underwear, dude. I just came out of the bathroom. There's pissed dribbling down my leg onto my pants. You know what I'm talking about? That's why you wear underwear, right? That's the whole point is that it catches your pis. I don't have that protection anymore. Ila, please, I need you. With that being said, let's get right into it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       So, uh, I got a really exciting announcement. Um, announcing a new game we've got here. Know your meme. Um, we're going to be taking calls today and one very lucky color is going to chance to win a brand new slam and hot Samsung Galaxy s nine plus. What's the value of that, Dan? It's like around a thousand dollars. Now we personally, my favorite phone on the market, and if you can call in and guests three out of five answers about Joey Salads, you're going to win a brand new phone. Here's the number. If you guys think you have what it takes to know your meme with Joey Salads, call (818) 214-8504. We will be taking that one lucky color after the break. Very, very excited about that. And true. We want true salad heads. By the way, if you're not a true sal ahead, we'll know and Ian will hang the f up on you quick. Okay, so don't be wasting his time. Okay. Loving the sound board. By the way, this one is dedicated to you, but before I, I've got a lot I want to talk about today. Okay. Lucy to daddy o five and so many more goofs and gaffs along the way. But I really like as we did last time I was in here, the trenches by myself. You start off with a great video video of the day. Does that have a, does that work? I feel like it a better, the better title. I was thinking video of bliss.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       It's a bit over the top, isn't it? Video of bliss. I'm a think on it, but I actually had two that I thought were so great. I wanted to watch it at the top of you. This one I got to tell you, you're gonna, you're gonna love this. I can't, I, I'm such a skeptic. I feel like part of me thinks this is fake, but I have to believe in my soul and heart that it's real. Um, here we go.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       This crawfish caught the fucking penny. Oh, show that again. I was crazy. I got to see that again. Yeah. Ethnic guys, just like, I mean, how do you react when you throw a penny? Had a crawfish and it catches it and its claw. How do you react? That's pretty much the only way.

Speaker 2:          00:04:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:17       But then the, it begs the question, why was he filming to begin with? Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. Why are you filming a crawfish on a bathroom floor and then throwing a pen yet? Like what, in what world is this something that you film that makes me suspicious yet again, I've come full circle. That being said, I dunno. I feel like it's real. It fucking looks real. But I, but why are you, why, why we need, we need a, the captain. We need the cabin back. Yeah. When the captain disillusion, don't worry.

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       But like, why would someone filmed this? I mean, what, Oh, it's from instagram. Yeah. Everything. There's fake. Anyway, I love it regardless. And then there's one other one that I had to share with you guys. This is one of my favorite videos to come from the Internet. And these past weeks, this guy went to city hall and gave an impassioned speech. Not about, you know, traffic or politics or whatever city ordiance taxables shit you would here at city council. No, this man came with something much more important and pressing. He came asking that massage therapists be able to jerk you off. Sometimes you got to go with you. Sometimes you have to go to city hall to get to fight for your rights. Why can't a massage therapist touch my dick if I pay an extra 20 bucks? 20 bucks is that, that's probably a good deal. It's probably more than that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:01       Anyway, here.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       Yeah. Anyway, this guy obviously says it better than I ever could. So with that, yeah, here you go. It seems quiet, Dan.

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       Let's go here. We let things go.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       It's a little different than are you? Why is it different, Dan? Uh, you know what? You're right. Why is it different? Hell we let ask doctors, finger men basically finger men all day. Not Basically, literally, literally finger means assholes all day. This guy's a hero, dude, don't question him.

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       Rolling.

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       I love the his, the crotch of his argument is what's worse. I got to go back. Is that really what he argued? He's like, it's more nasty for the practicality, so let just let him jerk him off.

Speaker 2:          00:07:33       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:07:34       He's saying, what's the difference you're already getting in the folds. Why not just touch his dick along the way? Compelling argument. I'd like to see a counterpoint made to that.

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       Right, right. Amen, brother. What a Patriot and go get one, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       Wow. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       Okay. Not a full circle right there. Amen, brother. That guy's definitely a comedian, right? He's got the socks and sandals.

Speaker 1:          00:08:30       That would truly be a happy ending for everyone. Fuck

Speaker 2:          00:08:34       Amen, brother Dan, if you are, have you ever had gotten a massage, like a, like a full body Swedish massage? Dan? I have not.

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       Seriously. Yeah, never done it. I was going to ask if like I've gotten a couple of times, but I just fucking applause. Sound effect. I was going to ask if it's ever moved when you were getting a massage? Uh, I mean, I can't say in a professional setting. I mean, you know, obviously in private that's a different, that's a different tale altogether. But no, it's, it's too weird. I don't know. I have like, I have a weird hang ups about it. Sometimes it moves. Sure. I mean it's a natural, what are you going to do? Can you do anyway? God bless to this guy, Ian, has it ever moved for you? Have you ever had a massage and he's off headset right now. He's starting to screen calls. All right, let's just say that he has no, okay. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:09:29       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       so anyway, I salute this Patriot and I'm all about it. All right. But that being said, let's get, let's get into the main event here. Boosie too. I feel like it's like a repeat almost of last week when we talked about Connie cannacon just trying to decode and explain what's happening. So Fusi, Fusi, tube, if you guys don't know who he is, he's a, he, he can has a prankster and he faked a lot of pranks. He almost, he invented almost like the moral, the righteous fake prank where it was like, uh, what, what was the example you gave me Dan, where he had one word. Oh yeah. He's like, he sends in the street and he's yelling at people for not having like they're a seat belt on or something. I don't know. Just like he's always got to have like a moral twist on it. He kind of invented that whole thing. So anyway, he fell off. I'm pretty sure he's, he's been having a lot of mental issues and it seems like he's in a full blown manic state right now. I mean, he, let's start here. Let's start from the top here. He says with 2 million viewers, drake is going to grace the stage of my concert.

Speaker 1:          00:10:47       He's only got 2000 likes. That seems like a far way off. 2 million views. Um, anyway, he keeps saying that Drake's going to be at a show. Drake's going to be at a show. He's never, he never talked to drake. He's ever known drake. He's, he sells out the Greek a free show and he says Drake's going to be there and obviously drink never shows up. But basically what ensues is a lot of insanity, a lot of confusion and a very little crowd. Um, and him stalking drake, which is probably the best, I mean the best, the most entertaining and concerning thing to come out of this whole thing. Um, this video pretty much sums it all up for me. Let me throw this up here for you. This, this video really has it all. It's got stocking. It's got a Jeroma.

Speaker 2:          00:11:40       Let's hear it quiet.

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       Dan, can you turn it up? Yep. Gotcha.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       Do to the people.

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       And by the way, he's taken this clip from someone else's show and upload. This is a video on his channel right now. So to put it in frame here

Speaker 2:          00:12:24       building,

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       this is when it gets really good. So I think he probably spent about a hundred thousand dollars reserving the Greek. And I will say to his credit, I mean I don't want to compare it to Taneka cause with Tana did was basically sell supposedly free tickets and didn't even give on the event or refund people his was free. So at least there's, there's the a big separation to be made there. I mean, he's not scamming people, he's just misleading people, but it's a free show. But what's really fascinating, it's just his clear mental decline here. Um, watch this.

Speaker 2:          00:13:26       I want to go over a little bit on that as hard. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       Is He, is he, I mean I can't tell if he's just like cracked out. Yeah. Our features on a manic rant. Yeah, it, it, it, it seems very manic. Yeah. It seems very mannequin and isn't he? He publicly has a history of that. Does he not he, he has. Yeah. He's bipolar, he said. Right. So I just, yeah, I dunno. I think people give food seat. Well, let, let's, let's keep watching. Let's get the whole frame of reference here. Oh

Speaker 2:          00:14:23       whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       I love that he included that. I Dunno who it was. I don't even know if it was a police officer could have just been normal guy who's just like, fuck this idiot, give back of your car. He goes from being like a total bad ass to being like, oh, I'm sorry dude. Sorry about that. But he leaves it in, which I find curious. You clearly could have edited that out. He finished his statement, but he got an I, and I hate to say this, but he got cooked a little bit by whoever was on the street. You know what I mean? When he left that in, find the interesting, um, now this is when it get texts are really dark twist. I mean, first of all, dude, if there's a setting for any video,

Speaker 3:          00:15:09       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:15:10       talking to a celebrity, this is him. I mean, look at, look at this frame. He's, I mean, dude, this is straight out of like a horror movie. Like are you in my basement right now? Fusi? I listen what he says. He's got the dongles hanging out.

Speaker 3:          00:15:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       Those downloads are not a good look for anybody, by the way, let alone a celebrity stalker. But let's watch. Cool. You've acknowledged stopped there. I literally look and I'm acting like a crazy person right now because I'm outside of the house. You're at stop there dude. You just, you just summarized it.

Speaker 3:          00:15:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       But he knows that it's not actually crazy even though it is. All right. Don't ask me how I found it. I've got ways, creepy, creepy ways. You're probably wondering how did I find you? You're probably wondering to yourself rent now, how did I find you and do I need to call the police and get a restraining order? Do I need to have my body gourds, body guards, escort and mount? You're probably wondering, don't worry about that. Don't worry. I I, it's interesting how we on one hand acknowledges all this, how creepy he's been. Right? And on the other hand, fully committed. It's why it seems so manic is it doesn't seem, yeah. Does it seem like he's intoxicated or on drugs or anything? He's very clear headed about it. It's just nuts. Well, symptoms of of Manic episode, I mean here, let's read it off. Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired bill. Increased activity, energy or agitation. Boom. Exaggerated self sense of wellbeing and self confidence. Yes. Unusually talkative racing thoughts. Distractability I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:17:07       yeah, Yup, Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:17:14       I started the line I never thought of. That is one old person.

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       It's an extra little layer of creepy that he keeps playing that God's plan loop. This is like such a creepy stalker video of like a weird fan food. If fusi ends up killing track, I'll be like 10% surprised God's plan. Baby. You might be thinking to yourself, he's like over him. Drink sleeping in his, he's like covering over him. You might think this is a little strange streak.

Speaker 3:          00:17:55       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       but this is God's plan for me to murder you right now. In fact, if you look down, you'll notice is already a knife in your stomach.

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       I mean, you know what he does. Meanwhile, he's got on his phone, God's plan looping God's plan. God's plan. Damn. Damn he is [inaudible]. He's going to come down to earth and cut and like, I dunno, I dunno how long manic episodes last, but he's going to be like, Oh, I dunno. Fusi. He's interesting guy. Like, I don't know if I feel bad for him in a way because it's like he's such a strange situation with him because he has a fan base. Like when you're, when you're having a manic episode, I'd having delusions of grandeur, the fact that he actually has a fan base and people encouraging him. Right. That makes it all so much more fucked up. So much worse. He's just enables his delusions. Yeah, it's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:19:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:07       Can you imagine how to see having a 32nd conversation that's never happened. I promise that this event is going to be huge, but I need you for it to be huge. It's like, yeah, fucking obviously he doesn't need you though. Unfortunately. When it goes one way, I'm like, I'm like, listen guys, I'm putting on the hugest show of the year. All I need is Tupac and Biggie to return from the grave and cohosted with me and it's going to be the biggest concert ever put on

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       sick, sick hype, Bro. How long did it take you to make that and premiere? Oh, oh hey. Now my video can get copyrighted. Dang. You just fucked me up. Thanks for the thanks to see your fucking, all of our monetization it up now. Now I got beef with you. Um, where's my mouse? So he uploaded on this channel. I mean it's still up of him. Literally. Here's a, this always trips me out when I can see myself. Um, it's still up of him publicly stocking a celebrity on his channel, which just shows you how unaware he use of, of how strange is his behaviors. Um, so that's, that's where, that's kind of where it began. He's no withdrawn from, from the Internet, right? I Dunno. He's retreated back into, into his cave. Yeah. I don't know. He is, he, he posted a distract on rice gum, which I find strange, like out of,

Speaker 2:          00:20:58       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       Clearly acting's not working out for your dog. That was a pretty corny read a clear, clearly acting, uh, not working out for me. I feel like I just acted that out better than him when I was trying to act that can I?

Speaker 3:          00:21:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:23       Damn. That was really counted on the phone. Wow. Crazy. Crazy. So anyway, it's just, it's really just another youtube hip hop did it. You got to seen a thousand of these rap video. But what I found fascinating about this was the vision board. I'm here, let me play for a second just so you can kind of

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       put into perspective what he hoped for this song. So rice, gum distract.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       So anyway, you get that. Yeah, I mean you really get the idea. That's all I need to see. So his vision for this rice come distract is number one song on billboard hot 100 can you imagine the country banking tour, race gum, Distrac the region of 50 million views and under three months. Well, in what fucking planet to rice come distract bro. Like if you want it to actually make an accessible song, why would you just write it about anything else? Club banger on radio in the entire world at least once a day. Manifest your dreams. Just as I did, man. I swear to God, I'm, I feel like I'm entering the mind of men reading this. Help each other, achieve each other's dream. Kill your ego. Oof. You got a long way to go there, buddy.

Speaker 3:          00:22:48       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:22:49       so I don't know. I thought that was pretty cute. Pretty cute. Pretty interesting. Well guys, I mean we can get it there. We got to get this on top. Billboard number one. I'm sure it's really close. It's climbing. It's climbing first. God, I really need the yellow pack. I need Isla back, dude. Next week. Next week. Thanks a week. Maybe Wednesday. No fucking underwear. I always joke about people getting shit stains. I was like, who gets shit stands? I'm in pants was shit and piss inside of it. I'll show you if you don't believe me. There's little shit streaks. I've got SMEGMA building up on my penis. I didn't have for skin.

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       Eva changes my diaper and cleans my Dick. Telling you Ila, please come back. Ah, where was I event? Yada, Yada Yada. He holds the event at the Greek. A free show. How many seats is a Greek cab? Like 10,000 new. Quite. What does this video training, whatever Greek holds? Uh, I believe around six or 7,000. Okay. Pretty big show. So this, this is my favorite thing to cut. So this is the show. It's happening. Fusi hasn't even showed up, but this, this is the fucking crowd. I mean, what does that like 20 people there at the stage and this Dj man, God bless his soul.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       Crushing it. Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:24:24       Look at the employees. They're like, what is this like these guys? Are you still like ushering like huge solo out events? What the fuck is this? I swear to God, you must, I mean, getting the Greek, we were going to spend 25,000 just to rent out the ace, which is a 2000 seat theater. That was 25,000 this on all this shit. I'd say at least a hundred thousand he spent on this. Yeah. And I mean the Greek is, it's an iconic venue. It's very, very much in demand. Yeah. It's not cheap. Wow. On a weekend too. Oh yeah. On a weekend. Damn. Yeah, that's, that's a pretty penny right there.

Speaker 2:          00:25:13       It's trying to hype up the crowd.

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       Well, I don't know, man. You're mixing doesn't sound that good. I love that. Even the Djs in on this illusion, delusion. What if drake just walked on stage right now to the hundred of you huddled around the stage,

Speaker 2:          00:25:32       he'd be so mad. No Dude, it's because you and not drink. Killing it. Crushing it. Damn. That's a, that is a coal to crowd my dudes.

Speaker 3:          00:25:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:58       Jesus Christ. That's the vibe there. There's basically nobody there. Um, and then someone calls it cause it's, he's livestreaming it. It's got like 60,000 views. He said he was going to get 2 million. Jake was going to come out. There's like a thousand people there, 60,000 people watching online. That's kind of a lot to be honest. But I think most people are watching just for the beautiful train wreck that they knew what was going to be and somebody called a bomb threat, which is just like Jerry on top. I mean it's like I'm not surprised. I'm not surprised. There are conspiracy theories and I have to say they're compelling cause you always have to ask yourself who benefits the most from this crime bomb threats called could totally be anyone on the Internet. I mean that is a, it's a juicy mean,

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       but if Fusi called the bomb threat, he wasn't at the venue yet. He was waiting to see how big it got. If drake would just, I don't know what he thinks happened. If like drake would just like materialize. He's like 2 million, I'm here. But if he called it in himself, I wonder if he was able to get a refund to be like, Oh man, the show never happened or oh, I don't have to be embarrassed because drake never showed up. You know what I'm saying? He kind of benefited the most from that bomb threat, which is why it's a compelling conspiracy theory. And I'm not saying that. How dare you say, I would never say or implicate or say and make any statement like that as an opinion. You know what I'm saying? There is a thought experiment merely asking questions. Been through enough lawsuits

Speaker 1:          00:27:46       won by the way. And that's plenty. That's plenty there. There is some sense in it, you know? I mean he benefit, he really, he did. Frankly, I can see him benefiting from that bond. But like you said, I mean, you know, people get swatted all the time. Deal. Really. It could be somebody else just, just as silly. Yup. Easily. Whoever it was, by the way, fuck that person. And I hope they get caught. If it does end up being food soup, wouldn't that be like the greatest twice in this epic saga ever? Am I explaining this? If people understanding, is this making sense? Who gives a fuck? It's also stupid. There's just another thing of like youtube has just devolved into such like, why is he famous? You know what I mean? Like Youtube is, youtube has turned into this like engine for creating fame for people who should never had even a taste of fame.

Speaker 3:          00:28:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:47       The most Fusi should have ever been famous for his stocking drake.

Speaker 3:          00:28:52       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:28:53       like there's so many people and when you give fame and like cause fame, it has, it has a lot of power and frankly a lot of responsibility that comes with it. And when you give it to somebody like that and many others on youtube, it's like you're given a bazooka to a monkey. Fusi should not be famous man.

Speaker 3:          00:29:15       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:29:15       so many other people. The cons, Tana should not be famous. My God, Tana should be working at Wendy's specifically. Wendy, she does the other fast foods for some reason don't ring true to me. She should be serving up Wendy's.

Speaker 3:          00:29:33       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       and yet here she is, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       Well she might be serving on burgers in prison. Pretty soon somebody's got to cook them. You think they get burgers and prison? Maybe? I think they probably do. That was pretty dope. Prison doesn't sound that bad after all. Sounds Nice. I don't know. This is why I'm like, I feel like I don't, I don't like, I love the podcast because I really feel like we're doing our own thing, but I just feel like you tuber is becoming and youtube itself is just like, what is this? It's like always the same shit. Like this is fucking stupid. I might have been talking about this.

Speaker 1:          00:30:19       I got to finish this story though. It's reality show, you know it's the same I guess. Right? But it's almost, I mean maybe it's not worse. I don't know. I guess you're right. It is the same impulse, but people look at Kim Kardashian. I mean I guess a lot of people look to them as a role model. I guess it's the same kind of thing. I don't know. Not that I know. So then basically the bomb threat shuts this whole bitch down and he shows up, gets on his, gets on a car or the uber driver who was fired by the way after this. So good. He's like, I'll give you, he said, this isn't the video, but I'm not going to bother showing it too cause it's like, come on, give me a fucking break. But he says, I'll give you $50,000 if you let me stand on your car and deliver a monologue to everybody. And he's like, okay. You know, so it goes on the car, he makes them hit a blunt, he gets fired obviously. And then food, see sharing their text messages of the Uber drive being like, dude, I got fired. I really need this job. I need the money. And he's like, talk to my accountant. My accountant's going to hook you up. Whatever. I can't tell if that's flab or six back.

Speaker 1:          00:31:33       He's got a rolled up though. Why does he have it rolled up? What does, and you're already wearing a wife beater. It's the most breathable shirt you can possibly wear. So it's like, it makes it look like he's wearing a sports bra. Does it got some nice teddy's but like some support, right? I can't tell what's flab or arts muscle, but he's rolled up. Just take it off. I mean take off the fucking shirt. At that point you're, you've gone 70% of the way training bra. You've got a training bra and for some luscious breasts you've been grilling. Um, it sounds weird to say a training bra and luscious breasts.

Speaker 3:          00:32:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:14       Next to each other. You know what I mean? Was like 10 years apart.

Speaker 3:          00:32:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       let's move on.

Speaker 2:          00:32:30       I love that line.

Speaker 1:          00:32:33       It's really not a great insult. Heating up my, you're heating up your breakfast. Well anyway, let's watch this shit. Um, you know, don't want to drag this out too much by the way. His event is called like a hate dies. Love wins or whatever. Rise arrived. He just gets on this car and he's fucking talking shit to everybody. Fuck you. Well, to be fair, there's a lot of love sprinkled in there, seemingly at random to you. Little Love, a little hate. No. He should call his vent a little love. A little, hey, that would have been accurate. I would have accepted that is a more accurate, I'm going to throw a convention called a little love. A little, hey, it's a balanced meal.

Speaker 2:          00:33:28       Anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       this, this is an image of a man on the, on the verge of a complete, you know, this reminds me of, you remember the coney guy? Oh, the county guy. He came the biggest meme on the Internet, right? And then he was jerking off at the corner some corner in San Diego. He was like the most important guy and then he was jerking off and public Fusi as a couple, as a couple stressful days away from full blown masturbating in public. I mean, I wouldn't be at all surprised if he whipped out his dick right now on that car. He's just sharing the love now. That's what I call love arriving. Give me three seconds by loves about to arrive, baby. Anyway, you get the fucking idea. It gives a shit.

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       Yeah. Uh, anyway, I really, for me, ah, he's, he's having a mental break. There's really no question about it. Definitely he's, he, he is bipolar and he said that. So the do needs help. He needs intervention man. He needs someone who loves him and cares about him to step in and be like, dude, let's wrap this up before you'd get your dick out in public because there's no going back once you go that far. Absolutely. Yeah. The top of this week when we heard about all of this and then I started investigating it, I was laughing my ass off.

We do the Bradbury's we could do, we could do Mister Antonio Brown berry farms forever. Uh, guys, I want to look back and memorial today Gaddy a five as you all know, was the great and wonderful Youtuber who filmed himself abusing both physically and verbally, his children for the amusement of everyone on youtube.

Speaker 1:          00:54:53       And if I can continue my thesis of youtubers being garbage, they shouldn't be famous. He was really the main exhibit there. Here you have a man, like if we can pull up just an image so that you all know kind of what I'm talking about here. You have a man white trash as as, as humanly possible. Who has found fame and fortune on youtube? Daddy of five. I mean, give it up. I mean there's nowhere else in the planet where a man like this, ladies and gentlemen, a man like this could ever find fame. Look at that. Um, he, he, he, he and his wife who won't say much, but man, she is something him and his wife were abusing their kids actually have quite a fan base. Half a million subscribers, hundreds of thousands of views on every video. And there was one that really crossed the line. The police got involved. They actually, they're convicted for child neglect. Um, he had some kids from a previous marriage, right? They were removed. They were removed. Yes. Right. And he was convicted from for child neglect and it's first channel we'll shut down. But being the intuit, the, I won't say the industrious, the ingenuity [inaudible] the [inaudible] daddy oh five rebranded himself. He returned triumphantly to youtube under the flag of family of five.

Speaker 1:          00:56:27       Beautiful. He's back. He's been back at it for several months until recently. His name came up again. And I'm sad to say after posting another video of abusing his poor son, who I'm sure, and I hate to say this about, his son is probably going to shoot up a school in five years and I don't enjoy saying that, but I would, I mean, I keep an eye on that kid and I appreciate it. I mean, I know that I've been through a lot and I love that kid. He's a sweet guy, but when you make your kid dressed like this,

Speaker 1:          00:57:02       that's kid's name is cody. This kids is the fucking, they just bullying on this poor kid. And he's like, man, that's crazy. They make him wear glasses with like a look at this shit. They make them wear these glasses and it's got like the tail. So he can't drop him, but it's like really tight around his head. And you cannot wear sunglasses, protectors and not get your ass beat all the time. You guys know what I'm talking about. Why the fuck bro? Why the fuck is the god of cringe blowing up Google images? Talk about someone's who's challenged should be erased. This guy's sitting naked in the fucking google images. I'm trying to run a show here.

Speaker 1:          00:57:46       He got me the god of crunch. He got you. He fucking got booming. How was he so high in the ranking for daddy or five? I don't get that. Anyway, he's back. It came up again and Youtube finally has said, daddy have five more like daddy of having a channel. Wow. Fucking roasted crickets on that one. Um, so I thought we would look back and cherish the moments we had together. So, um, this is from him, one of his new channels actually. And I thought you guys might enjoy this. Once again, cody is the subject of his ridicule. The title of the video. This is a re upload dad destroys son, Nintendo ds and well, I don't know about you, but that's pretty much the title of a loving family. Five overheard long. Absolutely wants to enjoy it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:01       one of the many fine tastes available here among many others.

Speaker 2:          00:59:06       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:59:10       So it's like an episode of police, except nobody's arresting him

Speaker 2:          00:59:19       by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:59:20       His crime,

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       his crime is that he just keeps taking his dad's d s and playing it. This kid, nothing better to do in his life. What a wants to play his dad's d s when he's not using it. Fucking piece of shit that need nerd needs to go down and guess who's going to be the one to do it? His Dad. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       What's posted? Like what is, this is just like screeching going on in the background fucking war zone in hundreds of thousands of views. This is good. Shit is good shit. Dan. Bad Fat cat, his wife. Something like the fucking wicked witch about it. Way I thought was like unlike, I mean listen to this piece of work.

Speaker 2:          01:00:29       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:00:33       what are you cooking kids? She's got a crazy wise man. I gotta tell you, if you could make the most white trash hick ass hillbilly fucks in Sim, they wouldn't compete with family of five. Can You Imagine Your Dad's screaming at you like that? So fun. You know everyone in his school is watching this dude. Sometimes you got to teach a kid a lesson.

Speaker 1:          01:01:21       The worst part is like, oh, that's somehow they did that. He's putting on a good show. Damn, this guy must have the emotional maturity of like a real 12 year. I mean, he's bullying magic. Bowling your own kids. Like not like being rough with them or tough with them. Actually bullying your own child and then, and then sitting down at a computer with that footage, editing, editing it. Well, Dan, I have to tell you, you're going to appreciate where this goes because his editing comes into play and a really terrific way. It's an accent, you know? Great. Um, the best editing is usually invisible. You know, this video is, is, is marinated finally.

Speaker 3:          01:02:08       All right. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:02:19       Someone

Speaker 4:          01:02:19       save this poor child. He looks like a murder. He looks they're fine. Yeah. Yay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yay. I imagine that's your dad.

Speaker 1:          01:02:35       I feel like he's putting it on for the video too, but he can't tell the difference. The kids certainly can, you know. No.

Speaker 4:          01:02:44       Same to them.

Speaker 2:          01:02:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       He's thinking right now. This is good drama. We're getting some good shit right now. I've squeezed some good trauma out of these kids right now.

Speaker 4:          01:03:00       Teach him a lesson. Teach that little piece of shit. Nice. You got, I'm good man. Really good. He gets good. It gets really good. There's a scene that one will tie a great scene. He goes to a,

Speaker 1:          01:03:30       there's a scene where it goes to the garage and starts hitting it with a mouse. Notice his brother flank, jump kicking him in the head with no intervention from his parents. He goes to the garage with a mallet and starts smashing it. Where's that? Well regarded this. This is when it gets really good. Dan, this is what I was referring to. I hope you enjoyed this editing feet. Wow. Wow. I really wonder why it's so poorly adjusted to the world. Yeah. I don't, I don't know, man. I just thought if I had a kid and beat the shit out of him and yelled at him all the time and destroyed, it's stuff he grow up to be a good kid. I mean, I worked for him, right? Yeah. He to I turned out great. Yeah. Okay. He edited end, sad fucking music. Cherish this.

Speaker 4:          01:04:34       When I heard that, I was like, no fucking way. Put that in. He's got way. It's not for him. It's not for cody, it's for the dad. The Dad's heart is broken. I see. But Watch, you'll see. He lays it down. Right. We've seen enough, cody. It's about you. Now Watch, he's suffering. Being a dad of five is tough. Sometimes you have to discipline your kids for the greater good because they're liars and they're thieves. By no fault of your own. Life's tough and you need sad music to help the audience understand how stressful

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       life is.

Speaker 2:          01:05:20       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:05:20       And you got to act really sad and upset. Wow. Very consciously putting a vlog camera at. Make sure the framings Nice. Let's, let's forget that too. Is selfie camera work there though to bill? He's good. He's a pro. But I have to say, let's, let's definitely forget that he's holding up vlog camera on one hand, pointed at his face while having a breakdown and the other hand, damn, that music has really gut wrenching.

Speaker 2:          01:05:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:55       And I feel so bad for so sympathetic. I feel so bad for this. Daddy. Oh five he's for Lauren. Oh, he doesn't care about the camera anymore. Isn't care fade to black. He died.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:14       Listen, is torture room now. If you thought he was a Shitty Guy, listen,

Speaker 2:          01:06:19       where is he? Oh, I see.

Speaker 1:          01:06:34       I had to do it. It really hurts him and upsets him that he had to do that. No,

Speaker 1:          01:06:44       you got it anyway. Fucking good. Riddens you fucking fuck that. Fuck that guy. God Damn, this is okay. Again, this guy's famous on youtube. This guy has made a healthy living on youtube. And I get, I don't know what my point is because there's plenty of legit people on Youtube too. But um, well and, and he's gone. Now what? I don't understand. Why was he allowed back? Yeah. I don't know. He is his family of five channel after being a convicted child. Neglect or was allowed to continue. I Dunno. I Dunno, but they just shut it down finally. So I, who knows, who knows? I mean, I guess better late than never, but shit. So give it up to Daddy. A five rest in peace. I fear for that. When he loses his livelihood. I fear for what will become of that family speaking frankly point.

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       Well we're at the bottom of the show and I had mentioned at the top of the show that I'm healers eludes dealing with some stuff back home and I didn't want to talk about it cause it's really heavy. But I do want to talk about it right now is that I'm Ella's dad passed away about, I guess it was probably like three or four days ago now. So it's crazy. It's so crazy. Like she went there for two weeks. She planned to go there for two weeks and when she went there he was, it wasn't fun. He was terminally ill but I mean nobody expected that he was going to die during her stay there. Like he, he picked her up from the airport. It's just, I dunno, it's been, it's been really a wild ride for her. I mean, she knew her dad was like terminally ill, but like the day she arrived they were giving them radiation treatment because his lung cancer spread to his brain and the doctors like we really need to kill this tumor with radiation. The chance of success is really high and it takes eight weeks for it to work. So an a week after that he fucking passed away.

Speaker 3:          01:08:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:00       Which is so crazy man. Like

Speaker 3:          01:09:06       I dunno,

Speaker 1:          01:09:09       she's been, she's been going through a lot and I do want to say about Ilos Dad. I have talked about them on this podcast a couple of times. Um, some wonderful moments I will say fondly now

Speaker 1:          01:09:24       because they were always kind of like not taking very seriously. The first great one being that he told me, he said, [inaudible] don't ever let ethan come in this house if he's coming over here with socks and sandals. That was my move back then. I was wearing not just like sliders but flip flops. The one with the string in the middle. So I was wearing a white sock all the way up and the string like shoving the socket. It was not a good luck. And frankly I understand it's embarrassing. This is my son in law. I thought it was funny, but he was serious and frankly he's a, he's an old school guy. He's all about respect and integrity. But I didn't wear sandals to the house again and frankly I don't do that anymore because it is pretty insane way to walk around the world.

Speaker 3:          01:10:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:14       So I can, I can and retrospect appreciate it

Speaker 1:          01:10:20       that that was a changing point for me. Straighten you out. The next great moment yo can on moment was um, God, we've told the story but it's like back in the day when we first started youtube, there was this one video called shake that Dick and it was so obscene. One, I can't watch, it's so vulgar and like our videos weren't particularly vulgar, but this is the one for some reason, the one that he actually saw and it was a parody of shake that ass. And it was, are lots of closeups of me wearing like basketball shorts without underwear shaking. My Dick was disgusting and obscene. It's legit. One of the funniest videos ever. And he saw, that's the one he had to see and he says, Isla, if you guys keep making videos like this, I will. I'm going to disown Ethan from being my son in law. And once again, I see, I get it. You know, I didn't know why that had to be the one, but that's the one. But that's these a guy that was all about, he's old school, he's all about respect and integrity and upholding the family name. But I have to say

Speaker 1:          01:11:36       he was, he was always good to me. I mean when I, when we moved to Israel for America, he's like a really old school dude. He let me move in with them. He had never met me before and he let me come and stay with them and sleep in their house and he always treated me well and he always welcomed me and he fed me and he gave me a chance to, to be there and work there and make it work with Ila. And he definitely could have been like weird guy coming saying my house. I mean that's, that was a huge stretch for him. But it definitely, me definitely gave us a chance that that made it all work. But it's, there was something that Ella told me that was like really I guess heartbreaking in a way. Not Really, but nice is that, you know, he from that moment where he was like, we're saw shake that Dick at the funeral. Every, all of his friends and family were telling you that.

Speaker 3:          01:12:49       Oh God

Speaker 1:          01:12:57       he was, he was telling all of the friends and family how proud he was of her and us in particular of of what we've accomplished since then. And they were saying like he was always bragging about you guys sharing your videos on facebook, talking about you and with everybody. And we unfriended him after the, the chick, that Dick thing. Cause we were like, all right, we can't, you can't be seeing these. Well we didn't even know that every time we posted a podcast or a video or a post or whatever he was re he was sharing it on his own facebook page too. His family is all school, traditional conservative family. This was like the last picture they took to get together. Like right when you went in the hospital was like a week left and he's got a big ass

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       fucking smile on his face

Speaker 1:          01:14:16       and he's rocking that teddy fresh.

Speaker 3:          01:14:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:19       And he is basically one week from death. I mean he's in pain all the time and like, I dunno, just the fact that he mustered that big smile for Ila, rocking that teddy fresh. I mean he was, he was a great one and it was a true supporter and he really enabled us to, to thrive and succeed in Israel. I know I got thinking about like, I've been thinking a lot about just this whole concept of like saying goodbye. It's like we're always, it's like, it's so hard, but like we're not ready. We're not trained at all. Like we don't ever think about death or like how to say goodbye to loved ones or even for us to say goodbye. We don't confront death. It's always like swept under the rug. Um, and my band mate and my really good friend, Isaac's mom also passed away suddenly earlier this year. So we made a little song that we dedicated to Ella's dad and Isaac's mom. So that's the end of the show. I hope you guys enjoy this song. Thanks for watching.
