It was such a funny episode last into oblivion. And uh, he just, he deserves better than that. You know, I felt bad about that, but we're going to do good the second. This one's not going to be as good as that one. Nothing will ever top that tenacious d song, the greatest song in the world. You know that song. It's like that.

We got her own grateful dead inspired merge. Say whoa. You can't really feel that she gets naked air for a sec. Look at this. Oh my God. So sick introductory productions. You've got shredder. You got both of us. I mean it's sick. Tie Dye, soda represent.com/h the extra take extra thick hat. Where are you at?

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       Represent the shirt is sick. I haven't been aware. This shirt. Straight up. Shane Dawson style. I'm going to wear this everywhere because I love it that much. Um, that's about it. I've got a question. So what did you say the link though? Because it's represent dotcom slash h three h three. You got it on the screen. This is what all the sponsors make you. Do they go r, r e p r e s e n t.com? Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know how to spell represent that gob slash street twice. Whatever, whatever. Just look what's on the screen. I don't know what I'm doing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       Um, let me ask you this. You're right. When you give somebody food, you feed them, right? But when you give somebody water, what is that verb called? You were water. Then there. There's no word for that. Is there? What is the word for when you give somebody water? When you give them a drink. Not Feed. Could you say feed them water? You drink them. There's no word. How is there no word for that? Clench your watch. Oh, I quenched him. No, your water flowers, right? Yeah, but you don't want. That doesn't mean this like I. This has been really troubling me this week. People say Ethan, serious troubles. People say, Ethan, you haven't been posting video disappeared. What? Have you been traveling? Yeah, I hadn't been able to get over the fact this whole week that there's no word for the word to drink to give somebody water and the English language we have, we're celebrated for having $100 thousand in the world going by far the most words of any language that ever existed. English language, no word for giving water and anybody in the chat got to answer. There's no chat. There's no chat. That's true. I don't think there's A. I don't think that exists to drink,

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       so that's been really keeping me up at night. Frankly speaking. Maybe in the comments you guys will figure it out,

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       but guys, I googled it and for a baby you suckle them well. Yeah, that sounds right. Yeah. My friend was thirsty so I suckled him some of my water. I think that that sounds like. I was like, hey buddy, here you think is suckling the microphone for audio. You got to work for third. I'm thirsty. So what happens with somebody is thirsty and you gave them something. There's no word, there's no freaking word. How is there no word for that? You does that mind bending like, and I've gone my whole life to until this week without realizing that that's what's weird to this person is saying I would go with hydrate, get real. You know what? How can I have some water? Yeah. Here the hydrate, hydrate, you know, that's not right. Feed. I fed him. There's no freaking word

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       for some reason you would say water. The horse water. The horse. Oh, water. The flour. But it's not for people. You could water a horse proudly. You could say feeding and watering the horses so you could water the. I mean, it's a little confusing to be honest. Half of me expects that somebody is just going to say it. And I'm like, oh, of course. Yeah. Uh, you tinkle tinkle like, oh, obviously no, there's no freaking word. So I'm, I'm looking to this ongoing debate about your wish. There was a chat right now. Yeah, it'd be nice. Can we invent a word? Like what works with fed feed and drank? I drank them some water. That sounds weird. She made a little [inaudible]. So anyway, let's get on with it. All right. I got a good one actually. I've never heard of this word before. Apparently this is a thing to slake someone.

Speaker 1:          00:06:29       Okay. Like a lake, but with dance. Hey Dan, get the frick out of town. Nobody it. Nobody on this show, right? This is a family show, Dan. I'm like, as a new one to me, I don't know guys. We've got a lot to get to today. All my God, we've got Alex Jones banned from every social media. I got some thoughts about that. I think you guys might enjoy listening to or not. It was one of the things when you express your opinion about something like that, it's like, I liked you. I followed you for years up until this very moment when our opinions diverse on this one thing and now I'm going to stalk you and threaten your family.

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       It's just an opinion, folks. You might disagree with it, but it's just my opinion. It's not a right opinion, so that's coming up. Very excited about that. Ajit pies. Back in the news. I'm excited to talk about the fact that me and Isla trying to have kids and I went to a fertility clinic and squirted in a cup to analyze my semen and it was a fricking weird and wild experience that I can't wait. I took the pictures. I want to tell you that it was something else, man, and a lot of other really exciting headlines. I you guys are gonna love there was apparently in Louisiana. We'll save it. I'll save it. I'll save it. My dudes. I'm going to save it all, but before we get into all of that, it's the goal for the day. What do we got? Let's break the ice. Does the good for the day work? Yo. Let's break the ice. Not Saying, hey, Pierce Morgan tries to sound smart.

Speaker 2:          00:08:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:02       On Good Morning Britain. I haven't seen this one. Her forehead's really glowing on her forehead. Very Cup. That is for glow. Like you should think. She's trying to be reflective here and it's like, whoa. But that's not a good look. It just looks like she got a greasy ass for it. I mean, I'm not trying to make fun, I shouldn't make fun of her. I'm just saying. I'm just saying it could be that she was going for that. There is makeup for that. I, I'm just saying if you put her at the top of a light tower and spun her ass around, you could probably navigate some ships, don't you? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's really not that bad. So anyway. Um, so even a brief history of time,

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       definitely just avoid those types yet to treat a girl. Ryan, read the brief history of time by Professor Stephen. A brief history of time is that history is the study into black holes. Pythagoras theorem to the nearest five decimal places.

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       Do you have a favorite color? This is like I'm, I'm embodied by so much cringe that he's trying to like make her look stupid. Ask Good in understanding that if you ever read a brief history of time by Professor Stephen Hawking, I'm like trying to see like, oh, you're dumb. I don't think this girl ever tried to sound smart. I don't think she ever presumed to be smart. And then so the genius Piers Morgan measure being a grown man to try to humiliate some girl who's obviously not the brightest, but she's not out here being like trying to get a Phd dissertation, you know, she's dumb and she knows it. He's like, have you ever read this book by Professor Stephen Hawking, who has except fucking nerds? But like, um, she's not up there trying to be smart dude, what are you trying to disprove? She knows she's dumb. She's like, no, I'm not into that stuff. I'm an idiot. You know that like, what's your point? And then the best part is this, he exposes himself to be the real turd sandwich. Let's see it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:29       Three point one, four, seven. There's certainly the first four digits.

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       Fucking idiot. Here's the best part. First of all, he named the digits for something entirely else. It's pie and he gets it wrong. Nice. I don't know that. That's just what they said.

Speaker 3:          00:10:55       You knew that, didn't you? Haley was wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       Maybe I read that, but like a normal person when wouldn't know that pierce yet. Bip. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:11:06       You just showed yourself. I don't even

Speaker 1:          00:11:16       know how you get back on the TV after that humiliation, but. So that's a bit of a goof of the day. What were you saying, Dan? Ian has an answer about the drink situation. No, I just typed that when you said only nerds have read that book. Ian's like, I'm kidding. I thought about. I've thought about picking up booklet. I'm sorry again. And it's like fuck. And do you know the pie to the fifth digit? Uh, no. Fucking idiot. What a moron. You idiot. What else? We have one other good for the day. Yoko Ono, the legendary. A lover soulmate of the great John Lennon artists. Artists. Yeah, I don't, I don't mean to discount her. She's done so much more than just be the soul mate of John, of John Lennon. So she's come out with a new album and she released a new single that I thought was a provocative, emotional, um, incredible moving things moving. It's called war zone.

Speaker 4:          00:12:21       Excuse me guys. So she's continuing her legacy, just trying to kick it and if you're trying to turn up the party or maybe put yourself to bed with some relaxing towns, either recommend Yoko Ono.

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       bad singers that are like, Bob Dylan's a bad singer. So anyone can see they've made a ball. No, I don't think Bob Dylan's a bad singer, but it's like they take it too far. Yeah. Whoa. Hey,

Speaker 5:          00:14:05       I'm feeling it. I'm feeling it. So you can expect it

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       to be seeing this in the club on the radio. How is this not on youtube trending? It will be after this. After this h three bumps. Just needed a little exposure. Anyway, guys, as I said, preorders are available now while supplies last. Is it bad to make fun of somebody for their artist? I'm not making fun. I'm indoors. I'm an independent artist. I'm promoting independent artist doing that. Or is that. We're interested in joining some art and now my dude's onto the main story at Alex Jones. You all know him. The notorious conspiracy theorist, right wing. I want to say a lot of people consider them right, right wing. I don't consider them right when I consider him an alien. I feel like I'm making them affiliated with a political party is like trying to pin down like um, what country you exist to on Mars.

Speaker 1:          00:15:16       I don't know if that made sense. I feel like even Martha's to or is to. Is to, to grounded of it. Yeah. Now the time. Well anyway, we'll get into that, but essentially you guys know Alex Jones, Info wars. He was recently banned by Youtube, apple, spotify, and facebook banned all the channels removed. He has been making videos since about early 2001 now. Today. He's mostly known for conspiracy theories and he's very right leaning and that he has a lot of conspiracy theories and a lot of targeted opinions about like Hillary Clinton and Obama and what do you call the pizza gate stuff he was deep into. I find it kind of interesting if you go back into 2001 just to lay the groundwork on who this guy is. Back in 2001. I have this clip from waking life. He wasn't really a politically affiliated guy. I just found this interesting. He was very much

Speaker 6:          00:16:21       antigovernment, anti-party propaganda, rolling across the picket line, lay down, lay down Gi. We saw it all about the government system of control. Very much

Speaker 1:          00:16:41       specifically says in this clip like that he's not a member of any party. So somehow his, his, you know, his style has changed since then regardless.

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       Um, so this is what happened. This is from verge, which is confirmed by Youtube. They confirmed this, this information here, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, Youtube Channel received a strike on Tuesday for violating the site's community guidelines. The verge has learned youtube for videos from Jonestown, which has two point 4 million subscribers that contain instances of hate speech, child endangerment sources, mailer with the matters set. Youtube channels are deleted if they get three strikes in a three month period to videos contained hate speech against Muslims, a third contain hate speech against transgender people. Sources said a fourth show to child who was pushed to the ground by an adult man under the headline. How to prevent liberalism. All for the videos. Yeah, I, I'll for the videos are currently posted on info wars. Now, obviously I can't speak about those specific for videos because it's so hard to find.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       I mean his shit's been scorched earth from Youtube and shit. So it's really hard to find the clips and question. So I'm just, you know, reading the description. Uh, but this one I do have the offending video. Oh, those videos don't include a new one, which was one of his new greatest hits of him making a threatening rant about Robert Mueller, Mueller, or molar. You alert. I always taught it's smaller, but he didn't get it. He says, so I'm confused. Were stirred a controversy earlier this week after it was posted on facebook that it does not appear to have been uploaded to youtube. Post on Info wars to the view had been posted in a news documentary, scientific, artistic contact, by the way there. Anyway, the first reach out to info wars, Yada Yada, Yada. Jones channel previously received strikes from youtube in February after promoted the false theory that survivors of the Parkland shooting were actually trained crisis actors that violated youtube policy against harassment and bullying, but strikes expired three months after they are issued.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       Dot Jones channel currently had just one strike against him. Now. I actually was able to find the clip of him talking about Robert Muller. And, um, I thought, well, let's, let's see what kind of stuff this guy is saying you the question right now, the real debate is like, is this a, it's being framed by the people who support Alex Jones as a political silencing that he's being shut down because all these big tech companies are, are super liberal leaning and it's a, it's a, it's a political shut down, right? It's censorship, right? So I'm like, all right, well like some of the videos they described could easily be like completely open to debate. Look, they're like pushing the children to the ground. So like, I don't know, I'd have to see that. Who knows? But here I have this one of molar, so let's watch this. Let me pop this baby open.

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       Now, this just happened very recently. Muir, everyone's so scared of Mueller. So I'm saying in front of people what she did. So here we go. This is what he's saying about one sheets. Mueller molar is like a lifelong Republican, solid. I mean, he's one of the most beautiful guys ever. Like now everyone looks at Mola, like he's the fucking are not a lot, but a lot of lot of people see them as like a total piece of shit con man. But I remember Donald Trump tweeting out when the investigation started, something like that. I'm glad it's molar because he's so respected. So now all of a sudden, here's what we're saying about Mueller, everyone's so scared of Mueller, Mueller, rape kids in front of people. What she did mean, Mueller covered up for a decade for Epstein kidnapping kids, flying them on sex planes. Some kids as young as seven years old, reportedly with big perverts raping them to frame people.

Speaker 1:          00:20:35       I mean, Mueller is a monster man. Cod. Imagine he's even above the pedophiles though. So I mean, well, right off the bat, can you. I don't know if not that, if it's hard statements, if. I mean you can't really call a guy. He's like, do you use straight up watched people rape kids? Like that's kind of. What's the word? It's a bold claim. It's not a bold claim. It's a slander, frankly speaking. All right. You can't just be like, dude, I have. I know. I know for a fact that Alex Jones watches people, rape kids, that right and strong statement. Let's keep watching. I mean, slander. I, all that is slander or does. He doesn't have sexual kids. He just controls it all interested in fucking kids. He just likes to, uh, facilitate

Speaker 7:          00:21:28       ajit being a monster like that. God, God, all people say, well God, you scared of him. I'm scared of not manning up.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       Dude, are you don't just scared of talking about this.

Speaker 6:          00:21:46       Good.

Speaker 7:          00:21:47       Let's give him one main fear. I'm not being a real man and I'm not doing what it takes and I'm not telling the truth. And so call it whatever you want. I look at that guy, he's a sex offender. The Danes and I will take down or I'll try and sell that shit. Gonna Happen. We're gonna. Walk out the square politically high, noon and he's on to find out what he makes you move, man. Make the move first and then it's going to happen. It's not a joke. That's not a gain. So real world politically, you're going to get it or I'm going to try a bitch. I didn't notice. You actually was saying

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       politically right now. Yeah. I don't know. What does he mean by that? Well, it isn't. It's very. I mean it's very. When you're, when you're accusing somebody of like basically raping kids. I mean we hold that in our culture to be one of the worst things possible to the point that where you don't even respect their life. When you degrade someone to the point of being a child rapist, really when you're saying, Hey, I'm going to, I'm going to shoot you. If somebody goes, if somebody who believes that he's a pedophile goes and murders him, am I like, if were to believe that he's actually like organizing a massive pedophile ring, how much sympathy do you have for the guy? Right. So this, this shit you, you really. I mean, I feel like he's just doing a character, right? And like a overexaggerating everything and it could be entertaining when you're watching it through that Lens, but from what I understand, a lot of people take him seriously and believe that he's believing what he's saying. So I don't think he really believes what he says, like about all the crazy stuff that he. Well, there. That's definitely debatable. Um, hey guys, uh, let me cut in real quick it. Yeah. Wow. We uh, we just got taken down by youtube. They just killed her stream. Really? Yep. Why? Community guidelines. Wow. We can't even show his footage. What never been removed.

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       How stupid are you? Youtube. Alright, we are back. We were live streaming and bright as we were getting into it. You guys saw, if you're watching the Vod, youtube in their infinite wisdom teeth removed our live stream and gave us a strike, which basically when you get a strike, you can't live stream anymore, so some genius over at live to live. I'm having a fucking. I'm not. You see what it's doing to me, shredders freaking out. We've been sitting here for like an hour trying to figure out what to do. Some fucking genius was like, Oh, they're talking about Alex Jones. Let's remove the fucking. You know what it is so insane is that my whole rant as I was just getting into was very. I'm taking Youtube side that Alex Jones is a crazy conspiracy theorist who violated the terms of service, was doing all this shit that shouldn't buy youtubes terms of service shouldn't be allowed and what the fuck does youtube do? Did like, you know what we need to do? They'll sit around and think of what's the best thing to do right now? The most best thing they're like will make us look so much better. Ethan is defending us. Ethan, who's defending us against Alex Jones right now. Do you know what we can do in one fell swoop to legitimize Alex Jones and to pitch Ethan often turn them against us. Let's shut as channel down and give them a strike mid live stream.

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       It's brilliant. Let's do that. Shut it down. What the fuck? Like how can I even sit here now and call Alex Jones, conspiracy theorists when our child just got strike down for even fucking talking about him. Not even. I was criticizing him. We were analyzing the situation. What are the how? Who watched that and thought to himself, this needs to be taken down right now. I was literally just talking about how he defamed Robert, Robert Mueller, Mueller. They're like, dude, you know what we could do to make the situation even worse for us. They're like, this was like a beautiful play by them too. Like in one fell swoop we can turn ethan against us who's usually critical bus, but in this time he's defending us. We can. Alex Jones was an explosive, sensitive situation. Everybody's saying that it's a conspiracy theory to censor the right wing media and one fell swoop. What can we do? Well, that's all fit and think I've got it. Strike their live screaming or remove their ability to

Speaker 3:          00:26:47       broadcast. Let me look at my context. We do have Ethan's number. We could reach out to him real quick and say, Hey, I don't even know what they wanted to say, but

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's be reasonable. You know, this is so stupid. I have to say this is so dumb because now the people that I was criticizing are going to use this as evidence to say, hey, this is proof. There's a conspiracy against this after all, and you know what? It's hard for me now to argue against that. Do you understand how fucking stupid you are? Youtube here. Let me show you some of my notes and I was going to talk about.

Speaker 3:          00:27:27       They even knew that we were going to talk about it. They gave you.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       I consulted with somebody high up in Youtube before this episode to get a statement from them here. Let me show you some of my notes that a deborah got to air this. Never got to air a blast. What's, what is it called? Goddammit. Slander against molar threats of violence. Clear violation of the terms of use. Sandy Hook was was a crisis actor. I've got this whole great piece about that so I can't talk about this now. How am I going to talk? Oh, there's no conspiracy that was fucking defending you

Speaker 3:          00:28:18       and now I'm offline. Nobody's even watching me. Right? It's so weird. It's like, who are we talking to? Nobody.

Speaker 1:          00:28:27       I'm off flying. I'm off the fricking grid right now. It's just me, you

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       and shredder. Who's really upset because he hasn't got walked into frikking hours and it was supposed to only be here for one hour. We supposed to be done. Now. I even prepared a soundbite. Destroy the child because I was goofing on. Alex Jones, so much brick and pissed off. We had this amazing. It doesn't make any sense now because I can't go on and on about. All right, let me just summarize my points. Sandy Hook, crisis. That's inappropriate. It was an Anderson Cooper green screen. The bumped it. Here's a lawsuit. Yeah. Sandy Hook. Parents are suing, uh, suing Alex Jones because they can't visit their child's grave because they're being harassed by lunatics. Oh Wow. Who Cares?

Speaker 1:          00:29:23       And the five years since, uh, our son was killed. Death threats. It online harassment have forced us to leave the city and relocate seven times. Wow. Big Deal or challenged, discussed, shut down. They now live in a high security community. A hundred miles away from there were the six year old was buried. I love to go see my son's and I don't get to do that because we made the right decision to move away. Destroy the child. You see I have content. That story is pretty crazy. How am I supposed to actually like be like, Oh yeah, I've got all this. I mean, I also see a lot of people saying it was a coordinated attack. Shut us down. It doesn't seem that far fetched anymore. What do I do? Do I just show the edit we made? It's pretty damn good. It's such a shame not to prepare an edit. Well, okay. The edit is not really editorialized. It's really have a memorial dedicated to Alex Jones channel being removed. Okay. It's, you guys really messed up. I'm looking over. I, I planned this really great segment, you know, but I can't, I can't in good mine. I can't say it

Speaker 8:          00:41:26       That's how I feel. All right

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       now. Now I actually did speak with you too were offline. Nobody's listening. I know it's weird, but we. So they were moving the strike. Okay. We can live stream now, but I mean obviously we have to finish offline. Started already. We're going to combine the episodes. They said they were wrong. It was a mistake. Whatever that means. Somebody removed the video. It wasn't. If they could. Let's put it this way. They. If they could redo it again, they would leave the video up. Somebody is probably getting fired today promoting. You think someone's getting fired. It was just some grunt. That's how you mistake is that you just go and give someone a strike and they have like really up to use rules. It's like some grunt who's making $10 an hour in India for all I know. You know what I'm saying? And it's like these, these low.

Speaker 1:          00:42:17       This is how youtube format and it's just so ridiculous that Alex Jones video. Yeah, they. They saw it as a re upload and not somebody talking about it. Obviously you could talk about it, so they said it was a mistake, but like this is a problem with how youtube formats to their company. It's so ridiculous. There's some, some ridiculous. Shut down our stream. They know us. They have our phone number. They know we were going to talk about it. It's like you guys never went, never went beyond, you know, an 18 year old dudes. First job who's making $10 an hour, who was just like, I got reported or this matches Alex Jones content that shouldn't be uploaded. He opens it and he's like, you know what? Fuck this guy. It's like, damn, come on ya'll. All right. I don't know how to move on and how it's. I don't know how we're going to talk about a score it in a aqap god squirting and a cup so upset that were offline right now and the whole episode is so weird now because like we're like, how do you talk about something else? I'm going to try. Let's get off this. So the other week I went to a fertility clinic because we're trying to have a kid. We don't know what we've been, you know, we've been trying to been trying to fucking knock you up for like how long? I don't know. I'm just fucking

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       make some damn babies. Sometimes I wonder. I'm like, shit, maybe. I see friends with kids and I'm like, damn, I don't know if I want married. It's not. Maybe we shouldn't do this dog. I do like this late at night of sleep. I don't like it was too much. But at night I'm prefer to sleep. I love sleep. We have friends with kids. They're like, it's been two years. They're like, yeah, we don't have a. Yeah, I hate my life. They're like, oh, kids are the best. Meanwhile, kids are the best thing you'll ever do. Meanwhile it's like, yeah, I didn't get any sleep. I have to leave every time we hang out at 3:00 PM. I've tried praying to escape my family for any. For five minutes at a time. Yeah. It's really great. So anyway,

Speaker 3:          00:44:52       why do we all want to do it to ourselves? Why do you want, why do we want kids? Like what is wrong with us? It's just we have a shredder is perfect. Yeah. He's a perfect angel. Like as perfectly as could be. I remember how happy we were when we left them at home for like, or we took them to the groomer yesterday for like three hours and we left them at the groomer. I'm still paranoid about what happened in those three hours though. We weren't with him. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       I have a fear that they put a finger up his ass or something in a weird way because this dark rumors. I'm telling you the truth. Our groomers are fucking weird. The woman who receives him doesn't have teeth. She's literally toothless, which she has like a nub,

Speaker 3:          00:45:33       but it's not in the way in her mouth, but it's not a weird. It's like a really nice place. Yes. But I have to say main local area. Like it's not like we're taking him to a weird place. We're taking him to a nice place. Right. Five star reviews or whatever, but in my mind if I were to imagine, okay,

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       lady, the fuck's dogs. That's what I would imagine. I think she goes shut. Has this move when he cuddles with you that he looks inside your ear? Yeah, and so she goes,

Speaker 3:          00:46:05       she says to me, what? I just don't want. I know where you're going with it and no one this thought in my head. Well I don't know what happened, but she says to me when we went to pick them up, she was like, oh, that's his mobile phone.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       That he licks in the ears. I was like, that sounds like shutter, but I'm also like, what situation is he? Why is he up there? What was she doing? Was she. Why was he is capable of putting his tongue and our ear. You're thinking he gives good head

Speaker 3:          00:46:33       five. You're thinking. No, but I was always afraid that you're going to say that she was enjoying it or something. That's not. I'm not. I'm not that. He doesn't like peanut butter, natural food that imagine what her mouth looks like. Imagine what her job looks

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       like. No, probably got rotting teeth in the I. No, no, no. So and so for, at any rate, imagine having a kid. You leave your dog for three hours, have to sick thoughts you have in your mind. So anyway, I went to, I went to a for tenor, for tilty clinic to analyze my semen. It's a funny situation that I wanted to talk about, by the way, checks out my sIemens great. Let me normal. It wasn't like, dude, you're assuming that the duck is like your semen is insane, bro. That's normal. Said it's normal. That's dank. You're seen as normal. That's dang. So anyway, you go to this little so it's just this little office. they bring into this back a little room and they bring you into this room and they're like, all right, well here's a cup. you jerk and do and when you're done you bring it out and there's like a little, you know, little window you open and then you put the cup in and you close it and I guess some other person back there gargles it and the same. It's fine. You know, whatever they do. And then I didn't even think about this stuff. That would be funny though, because you imagine there's like advanced machinery and they looking at it under a telescope, but it's just some fucking weirdo gargles up like it's a little on the weak side. I think it is. Advanced Machinery. Yeah. It's just a funny thought. Hilo.

Speaker 1:          00:48:39       Anyway, I walked into the room and I was. So I was just repost. I had, I took a bunch of pictures of the room that I want to show you guys. So let me, let me open that up. Where's all this shit? My desktop can go away. Fuck off.

Speaker 6:          00:48:56       Oh my god. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       so here squirting. And the cup pictures got a slideshow for you guys. So here's the room.

Speaker 6:          00:49:07       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       hello. Okay. So here's the realm I want to describe it for audio listeners. So this. So, so basically now what you're looking at his headphones that are plugged in to the tv. Okay. Now look next to it at the wall there's trips running down the wall, like some dudes just jerked all over the wall and there's stains on the headphones are on the ground. It's like imagine putting those on your head and why is it on the ground? You'd look. Look dude, there's a huge drip look by the left headphone. There's like a wet drip there. You see that right here. I'll put the mouse over it. You see this is a splurge strip. Oh, you don't see it? Oh look, there's this. Hold on right here.

Speaker 1:          00:50:01       Oh, so. Okay. So I was like, holy shit. Yeah. So these are like, they've got like playboys and stuff and this. Imagine touching that. The sticky assets white. Oh, it's coming. It's magazines. It's on the wall and hustlers and shit. But like this has been handled by thousands of dudes who have jerked before. You imagine touching that feeling. You got to wear like a hazmat suit when you walk into this room. I dropped. I was like, when I walked in, we'll wait till you see the chair. Yeah, just the look of this chair. That's the first thing you see when you walk in the room. Looks like a torture chair. Crazy. It's like a pee pad, like striders pee pads. It's like, it's like you to do it. That's fine, I'll totally jerk off in that chair. Now that you've covered it with it's a pee pad.

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       What to do and they expect the year like get naked and sit on that. I don't know. You got to do what you gotta do. That's the only chair in the room. I did a standing up. I just dropped trial and I just got. I just banged it out a little quick. No matter how much in this chair was covered, I would not say it on it. No, I was horrified when I walked in. That's when I decided to get my camera. When I saw this chair, I was like, this is unbelievable. What do they expect that you're going to jerk off onto the chair? I dunno. You know, some weird dudes are into this. They probably don't even. They do this every week. They really don't even need the analysis. It just turns them on what? This is. So gross. Here's the cup. So you crack it open, you do the deed and then you have to put the exact time you squirted.

Speaker 1:          00:51:49       So it was like 1153 and you know the exact minute. And what is it that, because it's so huge, because I guess, you know, over time the semen degrades. So lIke the minute matters. I like it. It's like right next to the tv remote. So potentially my semen could be even stronger and they were just a couple minutes off. Right? Imagine touching anything in that room. So they've got a tv with like porn on it and you can put the headphones off and sit in the chair and jerk off, which is insane. I just stood right there. I scored it All over the fucking chair and everything. No, I did look at this trashcan full of rag. Oh my god. They don't even emPty. That's what it was when I walked in. Just fall. Rags, like at least trashcan we to toP up. Close up. Why would it had funds on the ground? Yeah, I mean there's just a little. So here's the situation. Some lube, a tiny really old tv. I mean, gosh didn't, does that. It cost money to do this. Yeah, it was like 200 bucks. So what's with the shoot it wrong? They don't even have money for like a nicer tv stand. It's all. It's all going to be on this tiny look. I don't know what you know. I know ladies needs some kind of romancing. I literally, I was like, listen, I'm here. I fucking dropped trial it. I probably was in and out.

Speaker 1:          00:53:19       Okay. No sound. One minute. I didn't want to spend another second in there just by being in there with my dick out. I thought I was going to get worse oral thing. Empty. It looks empty. It's very low. You will get a lot of use. I mean just imagine like imagine this, you're about to jerk off with this lube and you have to touch. Even the act of squirting it out. It's like they're not aware of how gross I need to go in there and like a full body condom. That's it. That's my tour of the. I can't believe ya. But then the weird thing is like you go in the room and then you, you do it in the cup and you bring it out and then you have to go back in the lobby, meet the merck, the nurse. So you let go and you face thIs middle aged woman who's just turned it off and then you go to bailing and some old ladies like here's your, here's your bill for jerking off. So weird. Like in what situation can you just. Everyone knows you're jerking off and it's all good. Here's the interesting thing. So we all did our test. Everything is normal so maybe we should just not have a kid because it's a sign from god.

Speaker 1:          00:54:34       Just don't let me back in that room. It's crazy. It's a crazy thing. Yeah. You just sheepishly walk out. They sit your ass in another lobby and everyone's staring at you. Like to just jerked off. That's what you feel like it was looking. Oh no, they do it all day. They don't even care. No, they don't care. What if they ever see a guy like walk out and there's like some jazz on a shoe or something? Probably they probably seen that small room. It's like they don't. There's no room for error in there. Right. Pretty wild stuff. Um, we wanted to talk about youtube stream podcast. It's hard to get bAck into it. I'm exhausted because we'd been here for like five hours. I'm like, I'm worthless after a couPle of hours when we do these. My voice is already hurting from talking so much. We've just, we haven't even started.

Speaker 9:          00:55:40       Alright.

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       EPisodes sucks. What else? We got ajit pi. It's hard to go on. I'm exhausted. We've got the segment from ian. Yeah, I think we'll have to. We're going to axion segment. Should we just bring them out and do a segment? let's just, let's just get through this. Let's see. Let's, let's slam through it. Ajit pi. He's back. Oh, I can't muster the strength to care about this. I just realized. How long has this been, dan? Um, well, because all of the starting and stopping.

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       A little tough to say. Let's see, uh, probably just about an hour. The episodes an hour long. Oh my god. It feels like we've been here for like a week. yeah, I think we're actually probably under an hour or even. Oh my god. Are you serious? Yeah. I mean the longest hour episode ever. We've been recording for a 16 minutes since we came back in from the sponsor read and I think we broke it. The 35 minute mark sponsor reads about five minutes long. So yeah, about an hour.

Speaker 1:          00:56:59       Ajit pi. You guys remember this fucking idiot. This idiot. Let me show you. This face has got the most goofy has goddamn face. And I say that only because he's such an asshole.

Speaker 3:          00:57:21       Actually it was facing the article you're going to open is funnier.

Speaker 1:          00:57:25       Is it? See, so ajit pi, the chairman of the fcc lied to congress about allegedly cyber attacks. That didn't actually happen. So when you guys remember this huge battle for net neutrality, we actually made a podcast about it to. Oh, let me show this. You mean this one here? I love the framing of that shot. Can't talk. You can't ever complain. Oh, that's a bad photo of me. When like your, your actual headshot looks like this, like this guy just, he looks goofy in every photo.

Speaker 6:          00:58:00       Come on,

Speaker 1:          00:58:02       like that's his, that's the picture on the wall. So

Speaker 3:          00:58:08       this is the guy I don't remember. We've talked about him.

Speaker 1:          00:58:13       So ajit pi during this huge raging debate about net neutrality, um, god, I can't muster the strength to care about this is this so hard?

Speaker 3:          00:58:31       So I mean it is what it is. We don't have to do the failed episode. What we planned is not anYmore

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       anyway. They said they got so many people that were like, fuck you, I want net neutrality that their website crashed. And they were like see how bad we want net neutrality. And the fcc was like, actually you guys have greatly exaggerated how many people have come because the reason our website got shut down is because we were hacked and ddoss attacked by people trying to make it look like there was more people than there were.

Speaker 3:          00:59:11       So they just made a bright light because these such a little fucking bitch look at the house.

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       Like how

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       does, is there a whole team that has to agree on that statement? Yes ma'am. And they all agreed.

Speaker 1:          00:59:27       So at first came out by like their their tech person and then ajit pi boy came out and did a press conference in front of congress and said we were ddoss attack. Now everybody knows about tech was looking at it and being like, there's no evidence. We're almost certain that didn't happen. and he came to the point where it was pretty much proven that they will never d dos attack. So we're, theY're now forced to just recently, August 8th to admit that they lied about an alleged cyber attack that didn't actually ever happened because they looked like such idiots. This, and I'm not surprised this is the guy who made those videos about net neutrality in his santa suit.

Speaker 3:          01:00:15       So when do they get any kind of punishment for lying about it and in a sane world,

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       but my friend that is far from the world we live in, but just know that this. He got a pie in the face but it's not the first and won't be the last one. This, I think this guY's just use them cream all over his face. You know what I'm saying? Yep. If his face got creamed anymore, he'd looked like the chair in that office. Do you know what I'm saying? I know I got through that store. What else would go film academy awards. New category at the academy. What do you call those? The oscars. What do you call those? Yeah, the oscars new category at the oscars. Outstanding achievement and popular film because all the popular films never get nominated because it's all this art bullshit that nobody's fucking watched.

Speaker 3:          01:01:18       By the way. I kind of agree like the shape of water. Who cared about that movie? I don't understand.

Speaker 2:          01:01:24       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       I know. The one before was one day before it was like moonlight, which was like the super like, I know it's 10 people saw that. I haven't seen that one, so I can't tell, but I saw when I was traveling to Israel, I got to watch a bunch of movies, so I saw the shape of water and I was like, what? Who cares? Got the movie. She fucks a fish. She falls in love with him for no reason. It's like the. The storY was so weird. I haven't seen it, but isla has a really good thing going on. Like, how's it going? Let me get this straight. It's a chick flick. It's about the power of love when a bitch can be. Sorry, I shouldn't say it like that. I should've framed like that when a girl I didn't make a bit. not a bit. She's like, yeAh, I just mean that in like the colloquial sense, but I shouldn't say that.

Speaker 3:          01:02:11       So when a sweet young, lovely, misunderstood. Yeah. Because she can't talk. She's so misunderstood. She's mute. That true love can still find you in end and the form of a giant fish cock. It looks like a fish monster or whatever. Tell me. Does she actually fuck them? They actually have sex. Ahab biologically caPable of having sex and she does it in an aPartment that is not hers. She fills up Then. I mean, I don't know if this is like your family is going to get upset for me spoiling the shooting movie, but nobody cares. Um, she fills up the bathroom with water boiler that they fuck. I don't know. I mean I knew about it before I watched the movie, so I don't think so. everyone has talked about it already and if there's a sexual act, do they do with the gills? no, he, she, they acknowledged that he has like an.

Speaker 3:          01:03:07       Yeah, they went out. Did they ever acknowledge it? How Big it is? No, but she fills up the bathroom with the water so that they can swim together. The Bathroom? Yeah. She fills up the room with a water hose possible. Not possible. And then you need to do movie reviews. This is great. Then the water is leaking? Well, no, the whole Building. So let me get this straight. Somehow. She's a hero. She didn't care about everyone else in the building. Celebrated when she destroys this whole bill floods, this whole building so she can get a little selfish dick because she's so pathetic and lonely. She can't go over to the corner bar to the dive. I get some dick the normal way. Yes. And we're giving her academy award.

Speaker 3:          01:03:54       Isla, you need to do movie reviews. You're such a hater, like in a great way. Did we need holy shit. So anyway. Outstanding achievement in popular film. It's kind of a slap in the face though too. It's Like it's not a real category. It's like fast and furious. Is the winter fast and furious. Twenty one is the winner and outstanding achievement and popular film. Everyone stands up and claps. So like fake ass award. They've been. They've been given examples. Movies like the guardians of the galaxy and the star wars films. We've been nominated for both in this new category and best picture. However, the intent of this category is to honor more popular blockbuster type movies a lot. The avengers or star wars. I mean, look, if you can't make a gooD movie that's popular, both like lord of the rings one, I'm surprised star wars doesn't win anything. Well, you remember star lord of the rings wAs like sweePing every year because guess what? It's Popular and good. Yeah, lots popular. Can good. Makes it the best.

Speaker 3:          01:05:10       And that's when you, when this new categories fucking everything up, because no longer can you like popular and good, god forbid, and you know what it is, it enables hollywood to be even more shits. That's true because they're gonna be like, whoa, well we'll win this shitty nominee. Biggest fucking waste of time or biggest like they also enabling them. They also are going to make the award show shorter because they acknowledged that it's boring and no one is watching down to a mere three hours from. For me, I'm an hour and a half in this podcast and I'm dying expecting to walk your fucking show for three goddamned our other Washington. I'd rather watch her have sex with her fish for three hours.

Speaker 3:          01:06:01       He's like a fish. God fish god. He's probably. But they never explained why they never show like what's so good about him, his fucking car. they explicitly referred to him as a godless being what it is that god. Yeah, he's a fish. Got there. Like what makes him a god? They're like 15 inches. It's just so like, typically there's like this evil man, which is one of whom are no reason, no reason, and then she's the only one who sees to butte in him stupid. It's got to be a button for this destroyed. There's no context. And then we did the bit to Alex Jones saying the edit. yeah, we did. I could do a movie review. I hate being late. I hate 90 percent of all movies. I don't know if it's a new segment for the h three videos that you live movie reviews so and say, well let's start on the podcast. I've embarrassed and it's kind of like the, the segment that I hate on jimmy kimmel, except that you're actually coherent having an opinion. He's just doing nonsense. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean he just ran some incoherently and it's just because he has an accent. You're like a glorious hater. Like you are dismantling this dumb ass video. Like that's a beautiful thing.

Speaker 3:          01:07:26       I'll think about it. I, I anyWay, but you know, you guys judge for yourself, but I do fear that like, but you guys are going to hate me because I hate movies. Do you like probably so good though, but you can't hate it because you're so lovable. All right. what else? We got amazon glasses. My throat is actually hurting for like 10 hours. Amazon is patented some goggles and by the you know, yada yada yada. The workers, they were. it's augmented reality so they work more effectively. Here's a picture they look like ski goggles and their warehouses so big that they need to create goggles that gives you. It's like a gps. It tells you turn left turn right

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       to get the product. Speculate that this tech is actually being used to train deep learning ai so that they can eventually throw out all these fucking loser as humans and just have robots doing it.

Speaker 6:          01:08:36       Interesting. What's next?

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       We're so fuck when there's no jobs left. you know what I'm saying? Anyway, I don't really believe in that because there will be new jobs. Can you know there is a problem. I mean like historically it's like people don't ride horses anymore, so, but then a new youtube videos. Yeah. Well, how many people can youtube higher? No, but I mean there's new jobs. I know, but it's like before, but it's shrinking because automation automation was ever a problem with shifting fields. It was like, oh, we don't need people to raise horses, but now we're building cars and it's a new field or like you don't need people digging coal up, but now there's all these people on renewable energy. Exactly. But automation is a different issue because it's literally replacing people of every job.

Speaker 6:          01:09:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:09:41       And so all because you got to order your cute tips in one day shipping from amazon instead of walking into a roth five minutes away from your house. Did you know? We're guilty of that every date. What else? We got ian, you want to do this presentation for christ sake? Little uzi. Here's another ian put together a segment for us. Lil uzi vert, who's a hip hop rapper. you raps. He, um, he ripped off or let's not say ripped off. He got inspired by the art of heaven's gate cult. If you guys don't remember these sweet, very inspired and creative individuals. the heaven's gate cult. They were the guys you guys may recall when haley bop came around, which is this comment that comes around earth about every 2000 years or so. Dan, is that correct me if I'm wrong, approximately. Yeah, that's right. And um, hail bottom hale bob sounds like such a great news.

Speaker 1:          01:10:46       I kind of already with haley bop, bop. Anyway, these dudes, they act, you know, drinking the koolaid. But these are the guys, they, that's their main. Their, they originally there the original correlate drink? No, they were a applesauce aisle. No. Are you sure it is a johnstone different, different goal. God, can we retake this? What did they do in that? Both sides put poison sinai. Well, there night they had these sweet ass nike's, right? I did hear about the nike's. Yes. So they all were wearing, looking like, so fresh, like ultimate sneaker heads of these guys. And they had these fresh. Yes, nike's on. And um, they ate this apple sauce with poison in it. And they all said, smell you later or and in there, they believe that hailey bop, bop, bop, whatever. Fucking haley. Bob haley. Bob is bob. What is it, dan?

Speaker 1:          01:11:45       I believe it's hale bob hale. Bob. We'd pee. We hit that. Be hard at the end. Or is it a piece? Are we pronounced hale bopp for fact checking this right now, bob. We got the kids. Yeah, kidding. By the expert. You can get him in there. So hale bopp not yet. Hale bopp comes around every 2000 years and they thought there's an alien spaceship. The mothership that cruises behind the comment. And if they kill themselves when it's close to the earth, they go up to the spectrum. I didn't know why they are. Why are they so eager to get on that spaceship in? We'll be able to answer that for us. What's going on on that spaceship that's so dope. Parties. I love that. They were all like, we've determined that this nike is the freshest. We want to bring these, but I wonder if today would be easiest or what.

Speaker 1:          01:12:35       No, they're like, these yeezys are the fresh issue for eternity. It's too hard to get. So what is some guys are going to be hard it to get 10 years. These are you kidding me? Anyway. Um, so they died and, but, and so anyway, there's two of them that they left behind to maintain the website, which is hilarious in its own right. So here is um, their original art here. Heaven's gate, which is pretty sick honestly. What does it say? As was promised the keys to heaven's gate are here again in that font is kind of tricky. And to and do the u of o two as they were in jesus and his father 2000 years ago. Oh, I guess there are theories that it passed. Last time it passed was when jesus was alive. So he jumped on up to the spaceship. What kind of dumb ass plot is that of jesus?

Speaker 1:          01:13:33       To be like, yo, I came to this planet to create life and die for all your sins. But guess what? My spaceship only comes around every 2000 years you're going to be wearing now. Can't be wearing the freshest shoes to know jesus was the ultimate sneakerhead. I love that. Graphic design is insane. And like the gate looks like a key so I don't. It's so good. So, and his new album art was here. I'll show you obviously like, I don't know if you want to call it a parody, but obviously really heavily inspired by it and frankly it's so sick there. is this better? Yeah, there's was like ultimate freshness as was promised. The keys to eternal outtake are here and love and rage the ufo to as little use vert and his father 2000 years ago. Anyway, I love iT. I think it's great what he did. But guess who didn't? Heaven's gate who removed by the way, I probably have a chip on their shoulder because all their fucking homies or cruise a ufo with jesus. I've been a crazy party with these like crazy sneakerhead party. So there, there you got a chip on their shoulder and franklin and blame them. So they're threAtened to sue a little uzi vert. And, um, that kInd of leaves us off

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       worth ian, who as you know, is the keeper of culture and knowledge here to report on the huge drama that has been sending shockwaves throughout the hip hop community and the earth at large. Um, he's even been in touch with their surviving to cult members. He's been in contact. He has communications with them. So with that being said in, please, you're actually, I think you were supposed to come in already if I'm being frank with you. Hit him with the stinger. Oh, you're waiting for me. Alrighty.

Speaker 2:          01:15:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:41       Okay. So, um, as you guys are setting that up, kind of kind of botched the timing a little bit. God, jesus christ. Oh, what happened? You have an excuse. What do we think about? What happened? Are you blaming daddy's faded out and spit it out. What's on your mind? there's clearly something on your mind that you're wanting to say. So if you have an excuse for what's for this, tell me what's on your mind. What's on my mind is heaven's gate. All right, you're going to Play it. Cool. That's fine. But this was good at, you know, burning the time.

Speaker 1:          01:16:23       Okay. All right. Well, so here we go. So ian has put together and his classic form a powerpoint presentation once again is the keeper of culture and knowledge we've been loved and powerpoints should we love very much, which is the intersection doesn't cross very frequently. The powerpoint and the keeper of color and youth culture. He is putting in power often not crisscrossing. I want to bring powerpoints into the mainstream a little more. I'm glad to hear that. A great format. So with that being said in, please lead us on a bizarre journey into outer space and beyond. Okay. Thank you. Uh, aliens. Colton, hip hop and investigation by the intern. That is me. Uh, you kind of prefaced a lot

Speaker 10:         01:17:10       of it, you know, but I had a little backstory with lil uzi vert, grammy nominated wrapper six times platinum. Hit single xo tour life a cultist duly no. All this is the question that I'm seeking the answer. Thank you. Yeah. I had to pay extra for the emoji pack, you know, for the powerpoint. No, no, no. How to png. And what's that anymore? Uh, so on July 6th, this is where it all started. Lil uzi vert changes his instagram profile picture to the following the leader. This is, yeah. This squidward squidward looking fella. Look at that face and tell me that too. It is not a spaceship with jesus, right? The f now that guys will colyer. Yeah. He's a guy. Could get Behind. I think also an interesting note. Who's these only following one person and it's a marilyn manson. Just dramatic. Yeah, it's interesting. So that's what kicked it off.

Speaker 10:         01:18:16       And then on july 30, first he releases his album, cover the one you mentioned there. And Then on August 1st he tweets the following. Uh, I never really worry because I will definitely transfer to another body. Please come with me. I'm part of the new movement of which those are some ideas from heaven's gate. So do you. Okay. I'm interested. I didn't know that he was actually. Yeah, he did. He get the memo because that comment doesn't come around for bet. Well that's what I asked them about as well. Let's not get, I mean, I'm gonna let you do your thing. I'm captivated though. It is interesting. Lucy wants to ride the mothership because he didn't just grab the graphic. He's actually saying, you know, like transferring to another body or some of their beliefs. So, uh, what all this mean. So All this mean what all this means we need to know.

Speaker 10:         01:19:13       So there's them side by side. Uh, the bottoms there, like, uh, here again in 10 doe, those were the names of the two leaders. Doe was the squidward looking man. OkaY. She passed away and then he kinda went a little loopy. That was his wife or significant other. They were the cult leaders together. He believes like it says, as they were in jesus 2000 years ago, he believes that he is jesus. That guy's jesus. Yeah. And he's trying to get back to god. not like he was actually him, but he's been possessed by an alien spirit that also possessed jesus. Two thousand years ago. Oh damn. So jesus was possessed by an alien, found people, took them up and then came back 2000 years later. Wow. And grabbed a couple more. so that's, that's the belief system there. I got to say design wise that ge really nestled into that queue whole way better than that.

Speaker 10:         01:20:14       It definitely does. Someone pointed out to me as well that the green bay packers kind of stole the logo to the g. It's like the same, gee, these guys are prolific designer. Like this design is kind of next level. Insane. No, it's great bringing me up, man. Yeah. Also like the, I have to say the curvature of the earth is really accurate. Yeah. That's powerful curve curvature of a huge planet earth. But it loosely on there. Then he went a little too much curvature. Yeah. It's more of like a table class. So this is the guy marshall applewhite. Applewhite. Yeah. Interesting. Because then he had them all killed themselves with apple sauce. I thought it was inspired with a fun little easter egg. So here's a clip of him.

Speaker 11:         01:21:07       Your only chance to evAcuate is to leave with us. It looks like you've been drink lots of water, Planet earth, acid with a about to be recycled. Your only chance to. He doesn't blink, blink, survive. Graduate is to lead. He recorded these taPes

Speaker 10:         01:21:30       kind of as a way to get people on board and up to speed. Oh, this is a recruitment technique. Well, yeah. So yeah, in march of 1997, 38, members of the heaven's gate call eight, poison applesauce killed themselves and to board the comment and uh, they all put on identical outfits and matching nike decades before the deed. So I Have a picture of that in this next one. A fresh or they have a little patch. Oh yeah. They designed that patch as well and they all had it on their shoulders, sec, uh, the nike's or discontinued and incredibly rare few pairs on ebay regarding, for around $800. Right now it's pretty ordinary. The shoe, the shoe itself isn't that nice? But yeah, it's interesting how that's appealing. But uh, yeah, the remaining members are threatening legal action. Now. Hold on, I'm in. I'm fascinated by the fact that some of these guys were left behind apple juice or not to chug that.

Speaker 10:         01:22:39       You know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah. They're left behind specifically to do a cup just to maintain the website. Yeah, I asked them about that. Uh, am I getting ahead of myself? Do you have. you have. We're good. All right. So this is their website, like as it looks today, it hasn't changed since 1997 motif. Yeah. they really stuck with it. So I was just saying, I spoke with remaining member to get some clarification. So my first thing I said, how do you heard of [inaudible] before? What do you think of his music? Who designed the original logo is pretty high catching. They said, uh, we did not hear of him before the 31st. Very sPecific. We know nothing of his music. It was designed by a couple members of the group in the spring of [inaudible] 96. So a year before they all said, yeah, I'll took off.

Speaker 10:         01:23:31       This is not the first time musician has cooperated heaven's gate, uh, in 2016 frank ocean use the same imagery for his song nike's. So here's a picture from his music video. Uh, and I was like, what do you think of people using it? and you can see the, uh, the bed there and the nike shoes. That's that picture. Yeah. Oh, what they're going to come on, dude. I was just curious to attribute. Yeah. So I said, yeah. Do you find it upsetting or are you glad to see that heaven's gate is impacting and popular culture? What is the appeal? Really good questions. I was getting curious. They sent me a whole a, they understand that it's pervaded the culture, but frank ocean was not infringing on logos so, so they're not upset, but guys are like very business oriented business, very business. They don't mess around.

Speaker 10:         01:24:25       Can we just acknowledge this is kind of insane? That means having a conversation. yeah. Yeah. It was. Where did he touch with them? They have you can reach out. That's all they do is answer emails. that's damn one of their main thing. They dOn't have a job. They do. I don't say what. No. I have an idea of what it may be, but they didn't explicitly say, what's your idea? Does that later can't waIt? So they told me that they weren't bothered by that. They know that their information is controversial. Artists reflect the social discussion. Many are interested in the inner information and that the generation z group wants to learn more and are not as put off as others have been over 21 years. We're not here to waste our time. Eventually they want to see the planet and breakthrough with their information. We're not here to harm mankind.

Speaker 10:         01:25:13       We are here to educate and inform. so, uh, I said you were mentioning that you were hoping to see the planet. I've come to understand that the next level, that's kind of what they call heaven is only accessible every 2000 or so years with the passing of the comment. is that the only way to get there, it's estimated to return in the year 4,380. What are your plans for the next 2000, 362 years? Uh, are you, are you planning on just spraying the teachings throughout the next two millennium is by way of reincarnation because they believe in reincarnation. They kind sassed me a little bit here. Really? Where did you get the idea that we time ourselves to space debris, so hold on, wait, the comment of space debris that. yeah, apparently the comment isn't the ufo. The ufo is behind it in like a jet stream, but he's saying that the ufo can come around anytime he says the next level created this universe and can come and go whenever and wherever they choose. We don't know when they will return but will be less than 900 or so years. So there'll be so not worried. So they just click $900 where they. What did you get the eye? I love some space debris. Yeah, simple mortal. The other. I was a dumb ass for thinking this a. I love that they say we don't know when it will return, but it will be within 900 years. Yeah, no worries. Yeah. Yeah. Nathan fielder would just be like, okay.

Speaker 10:         01:26:45       I said when the members left for the next level, what was the conversation like in which you were instructed to stay behind? How maNy were asked to stay? Did you feel reluctance or possibly relief? Whoa, whoa. I'm curious. And they said there were no conversations. We received our instructional, all the group departed by 6:00 PM on March 24th. There were no options. Just instruction. Sounds kinda east. There's some baggage there. Yeah, they didn't really. They just kind of said, okay, this is what we're told and we'll have to do it. But this guy, there's some real. Do you think there's some underneath just like we're just loyal soldiers and we just got an instruction and follow it. yeah. But like you can tell there's some resentment there. You think. I mean if the 39 people are going to like this space paradise, there has to be and, but we need you to stay behind and duke just like, fuck you.

Speaker 10:         01:27:40       Like they're all doing their thing, you know what I'm saying? He's, he's worshiping the next level. Yeah. We need somebody To. Somebody asked me to stay the night extra to maintain the website. I'm upset. Imagine 900 years. Yeah. But who's going to watch like lil uzi vert and see what he's up to us. How many were left behind and how will you reach the next level? Uh, they said eight were left behind, five have died of natural causes, but completed their tasks in 1997, 98. We two are left in Arizona and one is in los angeles. Uh, we will rejoin them in a classroom situation at some point in time through carnation classroom situation. What does that mean? I have no idea.

Speaker 10:         01:28:26       We will reincarnate and rejoined them at classroom situation. Yeah. So I'll just chill in class. Breakfast clubs, shredder mess. Yeah. So I don't know what the classroom. And I love this guy. How this is kind of an old guy. Must be right. It's a couple. Um, the, the, the couple that live in Arizona, I think I'm jumping from one to the other in these responses. Oh yeah. they must be on the older side, like sixties maybe because the cold, the cold started around the seventies. So theY speak kind of like old people. Yeah, exactly. Michelle emojis. I asked him, is your primary directive to manage the website and answer inquiries? Do you have other duties? I was reading some of the guidelines for the group and they're really restrictive down to like they were instructing how big your pancakes could be. A just for dietary purposes, do you have hobbies outside of heaven's gate? Maybe your favorite movie, your favorite album? I was hoping that they'd given me something. Yeah. or like we love like nacho libra or something, but uh, some did internet stuff, media coverage. One was assigned to production tasks with filmmakers that didn't work out. I actually found that story. There was a producer to make the film and he went on tv and was talking about it and he was on probation for a auto theft and they saw him on television in California with the coal and immediately went and arrested him. That's where it fell through.

Speaker 10:         01:30:02       So we worked fulltime, still pay for everything and take care of the group affairs all the other times. So no hobbies? No. Any of the dutIes of providing information, just very focused on their beloved. The how forthcoming they are though. They just did whatever you want, man. You got to ask. Uh, so. And they got back to you pretty quick, right? What is this? Yeah, they're very faster responding. So I found that when they w before everyone went on the spaceship, they, the way they made money was actually a lot of them were programmers and so this was their old website called higher source that they would have a use to get programming jobs. And This is on the way back machine in 1997. I don't think it's there anymore. So I just looked at what type of websites they designed. And if you go on their website design tab, here's the list of stuff they've done.

Speaker 10:         01:30:54       I clicked on one of them. This is prima donna. They designed this website for a unauthorized madonna cd was not a thing on it. It's madonna, but it's like a bootleg and someone hired them to sell this bootleg cd and this pretty awesome website here. So that's how they got their money. Uh, it's interesting looking at all these old websites. I'm wondering sitting on like a small fortune from these madonna bootlegs. I'm sure it was a big business and still working a job. Somebody's got to bay hosting bill. They are working day jobs. Right. So I read about the website design. Were you one of the designers? Have you ever considered updating the website to make it a little more modern? I could give you an offer code with squarespace and uh, they weren't on the design team, so they aren't still designing right now.

Speaker 10:         01:31:50       So I know they said no, thank you. The website is to remain as it was in march 97. Really promoting our sponsors. I've wanted to throw that in. I looked like they could use it if I wAnted to reach the next level. What are the main stePs I should take? Predators destroying the power cable. By the way, I read that the next levels and actual planet. Is there an actual hell to like must've far in the outer rim. That's where a, is that a reference? I'm not getting cut off mannequins arms, uh, the next levels across universe. There are no steps that can be taken in this era. So if you want to go now you're kind of out of luck. Um, you're ranked number seven on watch mojo's list of top 10. What do you think of that? I thought that was funny. They still answering.

Speaker 10:         01:32:43       Uh, I mean, I figured that's kind of an honor, right? We don't think watch mojo means that much load on shots at one time. Yep. Yeah. WhaT is the biggest misconception you believe people have when it comes to the group at the members were weak minded, gullible, and brainwashed. Just the opposite is true. Uh, I read that the group purchased alien abduction insurance from a uk based insurance provider prior to march. Twenty. Fourth is, is this true? This is like a rumor floating around and it's on their wikipedia that they bought alien abduction insurance. Uh, there's actually a company in, in the best business ever to be in. How much does it cost for alien? And there's a. Anyone listening right now, if you want aliens, parents email me, I'll assure you. There's a company in the uk and geico has a report on it that they've sold over 30,000 insurance policies that is the best.

Speaker 10:         01:33:45       They said that they looked into it but didn't buy it. The internet turned a humorous inquiry by us into a weird insurance event that never happened. It was blown way out of proportion. So they just goofed. So this is, uh, I. This is pretty, in a short way. I asked if lil uzi vert could help carry the torch and spread the word if he's open to learning with this new movement. He mentioned or does he not have what it takes? They go, lil uzi vert would have to make a dramatic change in his grasp of what the next level is really like. It would fizzle so they don't trust him to carry on the legacy at a concert recently, this freaked everyone out where he said, you guys are basically old friend. I know. We feel like you're like one. I feel like ian's going to show up covered in a blanket with some nike's on and a couple of weeks after, I don't know if I'm going to stop talking to suck then I know I'm saying I'm concerned.

Speaker 10:         01:34:40       I've started to rethink some things. I may need to get some insurance. I got you, but were you at a concert recently? Uzi vert kind of freaked out his fans because he said you, uh, you all have entered the rapture. No one's flying up to heaven. Obviously. All of you are going to hell ride with me. You're already here. So sorry you can't get out. You're stuck. It's over. You heard the songs a million times. You didn't even know. So he's saying that his songs are like a gateway to getting people to go to hell. That's pretty bow thing to say to your fans. And that was just like what? His fans got kind of freaked out by expecting like the ground to like open up from that minute. I asked what did they think it is? If you say lil uzi vert fast enough, it sounds like lucifer, lil uzi vert lucifer.

Speaker 10:         01:35:25       And uh, I, uh, they said he does not know the ways of the next level. Everything he talkS about has nothing to do with us. He has to comply with copyright law and what's with little uzi? Is he really like? He's just doing an act. Okay. Yeah. I think for the it splitting, this is a picture that's on, on his facebook, his official facebook is a advert starting a luciferian space. Colt and dragging his fans to hell is kind of the question that looks pretty serious. That panic. I don't know if that's official painting on a. Nicki minaj released a song this morning. One of the lyrics was like, when I told uzi to go to hell, I didn't mean it literally. And uh, that's, that's today has representatives did not respond to requests for comment. I reached out to uzis, uh, people. Yeah. Is a little easier ever.

Speaker 10:         01:36:19       PlanninG on starting a space. Colt uzi, vert demon. Should I be scared of ms.dot. You're credible. You're increase luck in they didn't answer and I have no. I have no idea why they wouldn't answer us. Disreputable hd pacas no to us. Ian, since insane on. So the moral of the story really after all this is beware of rappers offering you applesauce. You know, it may be poisoned. Sure. Don't get sucked in. Just don't eat applesauce. Be safe. Avoid applesauce all together because what are you. If you're over the age of a year. Yeah. A watch out for guys that looked like this. This is a photo taken from their websites on the landing page, how a member of the kingdom of heaven might appear. So if you see a guy dealt fast tracks Who hop on like some adidas. Yeah. Everything about sneaker heads, they're all very fashionable. So if you see that guy walked around, you know, look out and get some abduction insurance really cut. And that's uh, that's the end. So that's what we learned. Give me some applause.

Speaker 4:          01:37:30       That was another great presentation to intern. Tom, before I

Speaker 10:         01:37:36       send you out, tell me about your. How was the reporting that I was talking with the members of this infamous colt? I mean, did you feel a lord? Cause they had some kind of a business like charm. I'll say, did you feel like you wanted to hang out with that? Tell me, did you learn anything? Yeah, I. Well, at first I was like, oh god, are these people gonna be weird and freaky and try and find out what like scientology will kind of comfort. These guys have kind of been like, we're good. We got 900 years To chill out. So they're not very urgent. You're pretty relaxed. Just don't mess with their copyrights. Most definitely. Well apparently they are not suing. They're threatening to sue their threatening and now he seems like he may be changing the keys back in. Oh wow. So it's an interesting story. ThAt's a shame. All right, thank you andrew. Thank you.
