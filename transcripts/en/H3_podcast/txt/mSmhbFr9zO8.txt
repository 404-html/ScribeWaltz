Well thought out, well informed opinions that are correct every time they're expressed, and if you disagree, it may be time to switch the channel because these are correct opinions. Go for the day. Let's start from the top. Baby. You know I was told I was joking with Isla. Yeah, just a week ago. I said, you know what is a funny joke maybe to tweet Isla with back to school, a lar backpack. I was like, Hey, get 50 percent off your Kevlar backpacks back to school sale.

Speaker 2:          00:02:05       And he was like, tasteless. Don't tweet it. I thought it was probably too far. I was like, okay, maybe you're right. Maybe I'm just twisted sick individual. Guess what we saw were what? What? What News station was this on? Here? Let me pop this up. Fox News, Fox business, one of those fucking business. Are we separating? So there's different St. Yeah, that's pretty much the same thing. Well, anyway, on Fox News, this is. There's so many layers of greatness to this. This is the good for the day. By the way, if you guys, we need to regimen it out. You Go. So

Speaker 3:          00:02:40       selling bulletproof vest, bulletproof backpack while playing bulletproof. The song sponsored by Chrysler

Speaker 2:          00:02:55       was tasteless. Now we're just going to make a little joke and here they're

Speaker 4:          00:02:59       selling it on the news sponsored by Chrysler. You know, it's like damn. It's like the car company. Yeah, it's all sponsored by Chrysler school shootings sponsored by Chrysler here. Meeting this morning. Mc Armor is the company behind high end. Bulletproof backpacks and clothing that are revamping. Just shoot her point blank. That'll, that'll, that'll teach the kids how to, uh, make sure their backpacks works. I remember kids, if you want to ensure that your backpack isn't a bulletproof, bring a gun to school and shoot your friend. Point blank is this, this is anticipated to reach more than $5,000,000,000 in the next seven years. That would be the, as a school shooting.

Speaker 4:          00:03:51       Oh, they really projecting a lot by 20, 25. You cannot project out seven years and seven years. I'm projected to be the president. See if that happens. So I thought this was just a goof. I thought this was a total blast. So next time you guys go to the Chrysler dealership, remember school shootings saying, have a backpack with your new Chrysler. Get up Kevlar backpack. How excuses not going to do. And that's just like, well imagine there's like an active shooter. You're like, Whoa, your backpack around the front. I'm just trying to like dodged the bullet and shit. Brought to you by Chrysler. So who's tasteless now about my ideas now too. It kind of a forward thinker, aren't they? See I did it as a joke, but these guys are serious as as a I want to say schools, the traditional saying is as serious as a heart attack and I want to revise it to as serious as a school shooting for as much extra tastelessness as possible. Now, Isla, you've heard the saying, they're taking our jobs. Robots are taking our jobs. I've expressed concern on this very podcast than automation are taking our jobs. Now. This video is going to haunt you. It is going to really concern you and hopefully everyone watching at home. This is not to be taken lightly. Okay. What we have here is a golfing robot. If they can golf better than us, then we are really. Fuck. Look at this Golfer

Speaker 5:          00:05:32       yesterday. A robot taking a swipe at this robot called Hail. You know it's true. You know, it's real positive.

Speaker 4:          00:05:46       Look at these guys jumping and cheering for their heralding the end and 10 years. They're not going to be golfers anymore. She's going to a bunch of robots on the field. Hitting balls,

Speaker 5:          00:05:57       golf, robotic football, basketball. She's gonna. Be Robot.

Speaker 4:          00:06:05       That is actually pretty cool though. You won't see that again. Yellow. Yeah. Really cool. Down

Speaker 5:          00:06:13       robot will take it a swipe. It kind of looks like the guy that would play golf or something. Insane. Shot robot. Dude. His name is eldrich.

Speaker 4:          00:06:25       Hold on one second. Value your jobs. They're coming for all of them. A Post Malone, our dear friend. I don't know if you guys follow this has just happened this morning. Um, well last night he won song of the year vms. Very proud of him. Yeah, he won it for Rockstar and just I just, I want to congratulate him. I want to say I love him. He's a sweet, dear, great guy. He deserves it and it's insane to see what he's accomplished since we met him. I mean even just this year, we probably met him like two years ago now, but like this year alone, since his new album came out, it was crazy. Damn. And it's easy to forget what is. He's 23 years old. Okay. That should make everybody at home depressing. That depresses the hell out of me. But I was 23 years old. I was probably playing world of warcraft and it in a disgusting dormitory room with like leftover Burrito's. I mean I was going nowhere fast. Pretty incredible. What a 23 year old can accomplish. So love and pride for him. Let's watch his acceptance speech. Here you go. Twenty one savage, right? I just want it, you know, you go to bed and you dream about maybe winning and then whenever you get up here you don't remember what the hell to say because you wrote it on. But you know, thank you so much everybody that was, he's not that tall. He's a tall guy, but he's not that tall. Why y'all making them laugh like he's five, two for Christ's sake. I mean the guy, it's his big moment. Why are you making them punch over like that? That's a good point though.

Speaker 4:          00:08:45       Damn the song. Um, thank you everybody for listening.

Speaker 5:          00:08:50       It's funny. We know a lot of them.

Speaker 4:          00:08:52       Honestly, in 100 million years I would never

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       expect to do this ever. So this is sick and uh, thank you so much.

Speaker 6:          00:09:03       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:06       Oh, 21 post. Close the mic on that. Thank you to east Atlanta. Lower than like more

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       lower the mic. They found like a button. Like can we lower the mic on savage by the way? I have. We were at his birthday party and I was like, man, I want to get them a sixth birthday gift because he's like such a good friend. He bought you a really beautiful gift on your birthday. He got isla, like this limited edition, Supreme Fender Strat Guitar. There's only like 30 of them in the world. Yeah, I don't, I don't have anything that is so valuable. Other than that I didn't know what to do. I didn't take it on the wall, but he just shows up. He shows up like a couple hours after he shows up, some dude shows up with a guitar. Yeah. And it was like this incredible fender strap, supreme limited edition. And I was like, oh wow. Really Cool Guitar. Like I didn't even understand that he was giving it to you.

Speaker 2:          00:10:04       I thought the guy just delivered it to post and then he left. I was like, Oh, we forgot his guitar. And he was like, it's for me. No, I didn't get that. But anyway, I was like, Damn, how the fuck do we top that? So well you can't. So. Well I can't really. But I was like, how I got to get them a really nice gift. So I got, I went down, he's a gun fanatic. We've been to this gun store together and I got them this cool little snippy. I'm, what'd you just link me, Dan? What I think is the guitar that you're talking about. Oh, let's show it. And we got pictures on deck, did we? We're so interactive. We are. So this is such an experience that we can just talk about something and show it to you at the same time.

Speaker 2:          00:10:47       Cutting edge technology here. This is such an experience. If only I could do it within. Actually pretty incredible stuff here folks, Birdie, Birdie, incredible stuff here folks. Okay. I'm still, I don't know. How do you display it to you? Do you frame it? Because it also comes in a nice box. Do you keep it in the box or not? You take it out of the box. I think you, you. I mean there's mounts for guitars. I think kind of just like a wall piece. I don't think you. I think you just hang it. But anyway, I'm calling you. His birthday isla was gone so I was Kinda on my own by the way, taking care of myself, which is hard enough as it is. And so I go to this gunshot. I'm like, what can I do? What can I get posted? So he had ordered this really cool glock from them and I was like, I want to get him something dope. So I got him this little snipey cool ass laser snipey they put on top of the Glock, right? That the official name? Or are you just calling it? It's an APP. It's called a snipey.

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       It's a. it's a scope. It's a sick ass scope by the way, because you only see it if you look through the snipey hole. So if you got someone locked on, they don't see the laser right here. Like in the movies only you see it. It's an Ip then. Right. And I got him like a thousand rounds. I thought I was feeling pretty good. I had like two ammo boxes, a snipey, a bunch of rounds and I was like, no, that's a thoughtful gift. Personal. It's pretty weird to show up into a party where it was a big party and I felt a little bit strange showing up with Ammo at that gun store. I was like, are you sure this is okay? It's funny. I actually went in there to buy him a weapon. I was like, I'm going to buy him a gun.

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       They're like, you can't like what? What are you fucking stupid? You can't buy him a gun and bring it to a party. I was like, Oh, I guess that does make sense. I guess that's probably a good thing. I guess that's the one thing you can do in America. I was like, that's probably. Yeah, that's probably a good thing. It's funny. On one hand I'm like, here on the show being like gun control, I'm like, can I buy a weapon? And then on the same day give it to somebody else. They're like, no, dude, I guess that makes sense. Anyway, I bought a bunch of Ammo, thousand rounds of snipey. I probably spent like $1,500.

Speaker 2:          00:13:07       Pretty good. Yeah. I was like, Damn. I hooked up my dude up and then I, I, I, he comes and I was like, hey man, check out. But I got you. And he was very gracious. Isn't about post at all. This is more a rant against 21 savage because I have beef with that guy. He doesn't know it, so I mean pulse was very gracious, very sweet as you know. He's a perfect angel. Probably the closest thing to a perfect human being and then savage shows up and he gives him, I shit you not like five minutes later, 100,000 dollar watch.

Speaker 2:          00:13:40       I'm like, okay, Mr. fucking hip hop you gotta show my broke ass up. You know, what kind of watch was it? Do you remember? I Dunno it, but it was like on the news and now twitter news. Where's my snipey and the that was newsworthy and now I see Austin walking around with his sick ass hundred thousand dollar watch. Don't see them walking around with this snipey. It's not about how much the gift cost, it's about the gesture. In this case it was most definitely about. Well he loved to watch. He was a great watch. He was a great gift. I just honestly wish maybe you could have waited and given it to him before the party, you know, like maybe a different time. So it was just kind of rude to me personally. And I do take it as a kind of a problem. So if you see savage, let him know that we do have beef. Don't let him know everyone's going to be. Hmm. No. But anyway, congratulations to post them. And then this morning that happened last night. And this morning, uh, I see my brother in law who's like, somehow like we got to hire my brother research. This guy is like in tune with the world. He, uh, he sends me a TMZ article. It's like post Malone's airplane is stuck in the air. The wheels blew out when they take off, by the way, what are the wheels just blow up when you're taking off.

Speaker 7:          00:15:17       How's that a thing?

Speaker 2:          00:15:21       So he's circling around doing an, about to do an emergency landing there in the air, doing circles, trying to burn up fuel to reduce the weight so they can, you know, land more safely. Carry. And so anyway, he landed. He is safe or vault. Very happy about that. We were watching live here in the office. Um, he made this tweet. I landed, guys, thank you for your prayers. CanNot believe how many people wished death on me. Fuck you. But not today. I can't believe that. When I read that, I was like, whoa. I didn't see any. I mean, I wasn't looking well. Yeah, but I wasn't leaving. But people are so insane. Be like, imagine he's on the airplane, like super scared and he's reading shit. Like I hope he crashes and dies. I'm like, what? Y'All are fucking need Jesus. I would never say that to anyone, but if you said that to him, you need Jesus. Can you. Can you diagnose that Ila, why are people saying that to them? Do they need Jesus or what are they missing?

Speaker 7:          00:16:30       Um, no.

Speaker 2:          00:16:32       They just knew their life. Yeah. So anyway, love. Congratulations. Appreciations to post malone safe and he's alive

Speaker 7:          00:16:46       and he's looking good.

Speaker 2:          00:16:50       Is looking good. It's got all this suits lately. Yeah, I know. It's crazy. You look thin in that vma video. Two. Yeah, I think also a lot of weight. I think he's losing weight. He's slamming his jam and he's a Rockstar. Loves us. Now moving on to something more interesting than that. Somebody emailed me. Oh, uh, over the past couple of days and email that kind of stood out to me and sort of shocked me. He said to me, Hey, I've been listening a lot to your conversation about wiping and anal, you know, cleanliness and hygiene, and he says, you know, what I do is I near my asshole. I was like, Whoa, there is a topical cream that you apply to the hair and then you. And then basically it burns it off and you just wipe it clean. So this guy was like, I use sensitive Nair on my asshole rink and I wiped the hair. I was like, whoa. That is so insane and hilarious. I think I have to try it. I think you

Speaker 8:          00:17:50       shouldn't because this stuff is like, you could burn your skin. I actually, I didn't know what it was. I went on Amazon just to check the reviews and like most of the reviews are pictures of people got burned, seen assholes. No

Speaker 2:          00:18:06       assholes. More resilient or less resilient really because it touched his shit. I think they would have let him know. Well, I think that's part of the charm is that, I mean, first of all, I'm in the pursuit of knowledge. This is like forbidden fruit, forbidden knowledge and Biblical and the Biblical on emission. It's more important. It's not just a mission. This is God's work. Read the Messenger. If you read the Bible, the story of Adam and Eve, the apple is the forbidden knowledge. People don't always talk about how they wiped their ass and cleaned their ass and these important things that we need to collectively share our knowledge. So I think of myself as kind of a trailblazer of a kind of a, a Magellan, Christopher Columbus. I don't know. I think he was someone who explored. Okay, I'm an explorer. I'm kind of a Darwin, if you will. I'm a great thinker. They said Isaac Newton, Isaac Newton said of himself, I'm not a giant. I just stand on the shoulders of those before me. [inaudible]. That's what I'm. How is that related? Because I'm how to ask wiping giant. I lent. I stand on the shoulders of the wealth of knowledge with those who've come before me. Nobody has dared and the history of mankind as far as I can tell, to collect this knowledge and to share it with the world. This is important stuff. So I think the pursuit of the forbidden fruit and the biblical tale of Adam and Eve there is much the same. And so I will near my asshole

Speaker 8:          00:19:47       and he burned. Narrow is like a something you put inside your asphalt really when you like. What is it? Let's say you need to take a pill but throw your right.

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       It's like medicine or would you call a suppository?

Speaker 8:          00:20:04       Yeah. So that's what that's called. And they're. Oh, that's this show. The first time you said that to me, I was like, what do you mean [inaudible]? You're good.

Speaker 2:          00:20:14       That's almost a sign from God. I mean, he grows God's language, right? So narrow in a way was almost a destiny. The destiny will use of nir was. So you kind of supporting my, my um. Well I think for think this week I'm in there, my asshole for better or worse if it burns, if it cures. I mean, I have never had a wipe in recent memory that wasn't Harry and I think that this could be it. Has the metamucil been helping you? Love it. It's not a cure all, like a lot of people and asking for updates on the metamucil, this fiber supplement. I haven't been taking it too because it's also just fiber, which should be good. But like when I, I didn't notice any difference in. Yeah, see the first time I took it, I swear to God it was like Teflon Colon. I just slid right out.

Speaker 2:          00:21:11       Yeah. Um, but for me it's not the end all situation. Like Chris had I, I'm, I have a hybrid situation. I, I'm using less baby wipes, but I'm still ending what supposedly he takes more because there's these huge pills and they say you have to take like a year of them and thinking, whoa. Yeah. Well I'm curious, what do you guys, you know, I, I want not just the great thinkers who join us here today. I'm looking for the great thinkers out there, the great minds out there that have interesting wiping techniques. So actual dark web. Yeah, exactly. So guys, give us a ring today. Eight. Oh, eight hot meme. Um, we're looking for great, great thinkers. Okay, so give us a call at eight. Oh, eight hot meme. And share your techniques. I'm very curious to hear what you're doing. Okay. Um, with that being said, we've got so many great videos come up. We're going to take a quick break, but coming up next, do drinks his own. Come in a video that's fully monetized. The channel name is gay. God beautiful. And he is living up to that name. He drinks his own. Come maybe. I don't know if I give you a reason to close it, but it's very funny. Very. So I don't think we'd want to miss this. Would that being said, my dudes. Let's kick into a break. We'll be right back.

Speaker 2:          00:22:40       Thank you. To better help for sponsoring this episode of the podcast. I need some better help. I'm anxious right now. God seriously. But this is one of these genius services. It's online counseling. They've got fully licensed counselors ready to consult with at any time you get access to licensed, trained, fully accredited counselors and therapists, Lgbtq plus friendly. Basically whoever you are, what religion you are, couples, anything. Boom, they've got you covered with fully trained therapists to talk to you. All you have to do is go to better help.com/h three, fill out a brief questionnaire about what's going on with you and they match you up with a counselor who is a perfect match for you and you can start counseling pretty much right away after they hook you up with a counselor that's affordable. Therapy is expensive, which is kind of such bs because everybody

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       needs help. In fact, you might even say poor people are the ones that have more shit to deal with because everybody needs money, but guess what? It's way cheaper than in person counseling. There's therapists costs like $300 an hour, but okay, I'll share. I'll spend half of my paycheck to talk to, but here's the thing. Pricing is between 35 to $65 a week for unlimited counseling. Meaning you are connected with a counselor the entire time via your phone or a computer. You can schedule a video phone or tech sessions when necessary. Usually once per week. They also have financial aid available that you can apply for. If you need help, you can afford it. Great, wonderful. Beautiful. What a great service with better help. You're not wasting time traveling, going to and fro. A lot of people have trouble face to face with people. It's embarrassing. It's tough.

Speaker 4:          00:24:42       It's hard, but this is a beautiful thing about this. The service you're online, you can have video, you can have a chat. Whatever you're comfortable with, whatever level with they're there to help you out. A lot of people are not comfortable talking to therapist so that best way to do it, to get in the door is with better help. When I was at my worst with anxiety, it was so. It was impossible for me to go into an office and get the help that I needed. That's the beautiful thing about better help. So guys, if you want me to talk to somebody for any reason at all, this is the way to try it out. Go to better help.com/h three. Give it a shot. You deserve it. Help yourself out with better help. Thank you for sponsoring us. Welcome back to the. Basically, if you're looking for opinions, look no further. This podcast and this is the opinion podcast experience, whatever that means. I honestly, I'm a little flustered because I'm just not used to this three minute breaks. Just ran back from the bathroom and literally Dan was like, hurry up, like jumped into the seat. Literally four seconds. He's got my paper towel.

Speaker 4:          00:26:01       So as promised guys, we've got a thrill ride here, lined up. This video shocked me. Okay. So I've been educated. That's good. It wasn't before this video shocked me frankly, like no video I've seen in a long time. And the story, the scoop originally was that it was fully monetized for a long time, which I get, I guess you can only blame you for so much. It's called do vegans actually taste better? So it's like how, how does youtube know that a dude is guzzling his own Jizz on camera? The part that really gets me about this video by the way, Gay God damn measurement called

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       Jugaad whose name I kind of liked that the Jugaad. So the thing that really gets me is that he's a key Jesus and like a little kind of medicine cup and then he tastes it and then he's like, he loves it, but then he drinks it three more times and he finishes the Cup and I am actually getting nauseous as I did that too. So this video is clearly per. So you definitely, if you're going to drink, you have kids on camera like that. You're definitely the gay God. Not many people can step to you on that level.

Speaker 9:          00:27:20       Autumn of this. Do you begin to actually taste better? And I have actually been Vegan for 12 years, over 12 years. So who better to test this theory that me, myself, and I haven't really tasted myself in quite a while.

Speaker 8:          00:27:36       What the fuck is wrong? Is this nothing weird? Like you're supposed to know what he's talking about. He's drank his own tj's nobody didn't say that yet. It's just saying I haven't tasted myself in a while. Like you're supposed to know what that means. People watching readily gay God know what that means. I'm subscribed to [inaudible] channel serious on his channel.

Speaker 2:          00:28:01       But like how frequently are you drinking your own con?

Speaker 7:          00:28:05       Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       But how is this not like a weird fetish like drinking or common front of people publicly is kind of. Probably is. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:28:15       So I might have went ahead and shot a little bit of myself into this shot glass and I kind of want to be open and honest with you guys and tell you what they actually tastes like.

Speaker 2:          00:28:28       Suggested my first time experiencing 10 inches. That's what it says in the top right? This is certainly the gay God might do, but like what? I just don't understand. Like you're, you can be gay. Like obviously no one cares that you're gay in this day and age, but like when your whole identity, everything you do and talk about and is like a bow like that you're gay. It's like there's gotta be more to you than that. Everything's about like, I drink matches. I took a 10 inch cock. It's like there's gotta be more to you than that

Speaker 8:          00:29:02       tube game that everyone's trying to play now. And like everything's got to be so crazy like we used to. Oh, we did this video of tasting different sodas and weird flavors.

Speaker 2:          00:29:15       I forgot to tell you that one. This is, this is. No, it's like gotten this far. It tasting gross sodas is not enough anymore. Know what he should've done is be like, this is a black guys or white guys is a vegans jazz.

Speaker 8:          00:29:32       Well, it's not done. You know, I watched it all. No, and when the videos

Speaker 2:          00:29:37       five times because face right now. All right, well anyway, well I'll have to bookmark of the. My first time I took 10 inches for a related to Austin the other day. No,

Speaker 9:          00:29:52       Tmi and I'll buy you. Don't you only live once the bottom up? No, just kidding. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:29:59       He's not just kidding though. He drinks it all like throughout the video when I saw that, I was like, oh thank God it's not. It's actually just clickbait, but I promise he drinks at all and I don't know if I even need to necessarily. Yeah, I'll know. I'll keep watching it. I'll know when I've had enough. You tell me when you're done watching this. Okay. Because I don't, you know, I'll shut up

Speaker 9:          00:30:23       obviously like I let the gait belt with a whole bunch of different guy. Not a whole bunch what was making myself sound a little sweaty, but I feel that yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:30:31       holding a cup of your own ges and you're about to drink it. You don't need help. Sonic slutty

Speaker 9:          00:30:37       meat eaters. They're so salty, which is weird because I um, I eat a lot of salt but all my exes are like, yeah, you're really sweet tasting. And I'm like, how has that been? Like I eat like 10 times as much salt as you, but I guess it has to do with like red meat consumption and all that stuff. So they are always in that sense

Speaker 2:          00:30:58       you've had enough. You will want to see him drink or should we really? It did it. He did it here. Let's see. Let's hit a drink here.

Speaker 9:          00:31:09       Potent smelling like it kind of.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       Oh, he drank from already. It looks like less and volume. Oh, there you go.

Speaker 9:          00:31:22       So I'm basically like, well let's see what I smell like taking the sniff of his own kid. Okay, I'm getting late. So let's hit the button on this. You don't want to see him hit it?

Speaker 2:          00:31:38       No, not really. You don't want to see him throw it back a bit. That people will see it. Throw it back. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:31:56       Like warm, Sunny d, like if an artist.

Speaker 2:          00:35:50       She's like, Yup. Nailed it. She, she, I irresistible even trying. And you know where it goes from here. I got to say I love Chris. It's getting to the point where it's just so good. Is making parodies of himself at this point. Yeah. No, it's turned. It's really turning into something special. We've got current events. We've got everything to talk about everything going on in the world. I'm going to tell you guys about it now. Enter the current events experience, drug overdoses up 10 percent and the US. What is going on? Well, it's mostly from prescription drugs. Actually shouldn't really surprise anyone, but I haven't been following the story. And then here you can see by year at chart basically since 2016 and to this date it's shot up. These are all synthetic opioids. Basically pain prescribed prescription painkillers way worse than heroin. Yeah, like almost double that that if you go. It's interesting if you go back to like 2012, 2013, it was the least deadly. Although what's going on in the US, if you go back to 1999, people weren't really dying from drugs

Speaker 2:          00:37:23       but somehow unliked and turn the end of this century. Everybody's what's going on. People are profiting from it and heroin, cocaine, but it's like all going up. Is this a cultural issue or is this. Well, you could, you could say the, the whole graph going up. Maybe it's a cultural issue, but yeah, that one spike on the synthetic opioids, right? Is Not. I am. I am very curious about the cultural issue of why in the past 2015 or 15 to 20 years or is everybody dying from like, what the fuck? I wonder if there's some explanation or visit. Just life has become so unbearable. You know, it's like, let's take away health care, let's put everyone in that and let's just give them some opiates to fucking kill themselves on. It's become a lot hard. I'll tell you what. Life's become a lot harder. If you go back to 1999, people could buy houses that could afford rent and over these past two decades it's gotten a lot harder to live a lot more expensive, blow harder to get medical treatment. I don't know if that's a relation by. That's pretty sad. There's a bigger conversation here besides affect everyone's dying on opioids, but that is the story here now. I've been watching. I just find it so ironic, like let me open this again. That there's this war on drugs like marijuana. First of all, I'm not a marijuana user and I think that it's benefits and is greatly exaggerated. I don't think marijuana is an innocent truck, but I do find it absolutely the greatest,

Speaker 2:          00:39:10       probably the single greatest problem with our society is the fact that one percent of Americans are in prison, most of them for harmless drug offense. So it's like we're locking up marijuana users

Speaker 7:          00:39:24       and meanwhile

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       doctors and pharmaceutical companies are openly poisoning people and I mean we're talking about 30,000 deaths. That's a small subset of people who were addicted, whose lives are being ruined because they're taking so many of these opiates and doctors are just giving them out like fucking candy because they're getting kickbacks. There's like three big companies who are distributed all this and they know exactly what they were doing and oh yeah, that's just what it is. We saw the 60 minutes, um, report about this, how there was like little pain clinics opening up. That's when we seen them. I've seen them all over the place. I'm like, what is that pain clinic? And apparently you can just walk in and a doctor will prescribe you a painkiller and it's also predictive. Don't give you anything. They'll give you oxycontin. They'll be any opiate, any crazy shit you want. Just be like, hey my, hey doc, my back hurts and these crooked ass doctor, they're just writing prescriptions all day long. My Dad, he um, he had like some arthritic pain in his wrist and this doctor gave him like an unlimited supply of like really intense painkillers. And I was like, Whoa, like if he actually took kids so easy. And I mean this is an ongoing issue. It's not like a, it's not like doesn't abilitative his life, right? He doesn't. Nothing in my opinion that a little tylenol or Ibuprofen couldn't resolve.

Speaker 7:          00:41:01       But like, that's insane.

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       That's so crazy what's going on there. And anyway, in the 60 minutes report that I hired, they would come in. They were showing how these huge pharmaceutical companies are basically con always lobbying congress to not enforce or regulate or control at all this, this growing issue. They showed like for example, like there was one town like this is really ravaging like poor white communities. It seems like in rural America,

Speaker 4:          00:41:35       like Arkansas and Alabama and Mississippi, there was like a small town in Mississippi or somewhere that had imported so many and sold so many painkillers that it was something like 50 pills for every resident of the city.

Speaker 11:         00:41:54       Hm.

Speaker 4:          00:41:55       Which means that they were probably just selling it to drug dealers, but like there's glaring problems here. Have everyone dropped it like this, this is, this is so sick and, and the government's not doing anything about it because there's so much a lobbying money and meanwhile we're lucking up marijuana users. Yeah. So that's pretty nuts. That really grinds my gears. You know, I just hate this whole, like moral. There's always this moral argument from like army. I mean, Jeff sessions, the attorney general thinks that marijuana should be like a federal crime. Like he's staunchly against legalizing marijuana. It's like, okay dude, what are you doing about this shit? Like glad that you got your moral imperative about marijuana and, and relatively harmless drugs. What are you doing about this shit so twisted man. Fucking can you believe that? It's like Tiawana up there. I've driven past few places when I'm driving around town. You see like a pain clinic. I was like, what does that mean, a pain clinic? What do you, what do you do there? I never imagined that it was actually just people giving prescription drugs out like nothing.

Speaker 8:          00:43:20       I have no idea. So I'm just writing what you were talking about and uh, yeah. And like all of a sudden there is a small town and the pharmacy will be buying 50 times the amount that a normal pharmacy right is buying. Yeah. And it's like they're just turning a blind eye, just letting it happen

Speaker 4:          00:43:40       because the pharmaceutical drug companies that are lobbying the shit out of him and blocking it. It's like congress is so twisted. These guys are so fucking corrupt. It's like scary. Not to mention the, that the water is turning frogs gay. That's a whole nother issue. Um, do you want to talk about this airplane story Ilah or did we find it too little, too sad

Speaker 8:          00:44:06       when you already brought it up?

Speaker 4:          00:44:08       Yeah. Well, come on. Is this the video you put together? Where's the one you put together, Dan? The, uh, the edit, it's a shared with you, shared with me where here, I'll drop it in the inner chat right now. Um, this story isn't weird and wild man and it's kind

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       of sad. It's very sad. I'm this guy, I'm not sure how he even got in the car, works in airplane. Like how is it so easy to just, there's no key. You think he masterminded this. It's not easy, right? Figuring out if this guy works at an airplane in Seattle and he just stole the airplane and went for a joy ride, but his intention was, was to commit suicide. And what's so intriguing about it is basically this conversation was recorded between him and air control of air control. Being like, hey man, you know, bring it, bring it down. And he's just, he's just so casual about it. It just seems like he's having a good time. Uh, Dan, I don't see it. Just drop the Lincoln, the, it didn't work. I clicked it. I think I need it. But here I've got it in your email. So here, let's pop this up,

Speaker 11:         00:45:45       right?

Speaker 2:          00:45:48       Twenty one year old.

Speaker 12:         00:45:52       Hold on with me for a second.

Speaker 2:          00:45:55       So interesting

Speaker 12:         00:46:07       plane around. You seem comfortable with that.

Speaker 2:          00:46:23       What's so crazy? Is this what you guys are seeing as all footage people shop from the ground because this guy was like, I'm going to try doing barrel rolls and all these tricks because his intention was to die. So he was almost just like. But he was, he was performing some pretty amazing so being like don't want to hurt people on the street. So he was also careful of that. Yeah. Really interesting. No, he definitely wasn't going to hurt anyone

Speaker 12:         00:46:52       and you can see all the terrain around and you've got no issue with visibility or anything. I got some gas to go check out the Olympics and rich are able to tell without the tutor at. They're just not taking it's any jets. I'm actually keeping you away from aircraft trying to land at Seatac, you know, screwing up everyone else's day. Oh, hopefully went charter because it's going down jail time. I mean I would hope it is for a guy like me. We're not going to worry or think about that, but could you start? I believe so. I'm still working on an issue average. Don't say stuff like that. He better than trying to lay in it like I know how to put the landing

Speaker 4:          00:48:19       for the record.

Speaker 12:         00:48:26       Know. I think it would give you pull this off. You want it to land court field. You wanted to try. That might be the best way to set up and see if we can land there because I don't think I'd be happy with you. The you that I did this year that I did this. I would like to apologize to each and every one of them. I guess I never really knew it. Alrighty. Hey, find the guy to a, a, a back flip ramp.

Speaker 4:          00:49:29       It's amazing. But guys, seriously shit. You're fucking feeling bad man. Definitely don't steal a plane, but little followup to that somewhat depressing story. This is charming, charming stuff here.

Speaker 13:         00:49:58       No, I'm just saying these guys are posing at the same exact. Are you serious? Come on. You gotta. Love that. They both. Come on. Give me a fucking break. Would you? Would you please give me a fucking break? We've got a double proposal here at Disneyland for.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       They're crying the freaking out. That's at the magic castle. Come on guys. Give me a fucking break here. We've got a double proposal. Am I right? This warms my heart. I'm going to lie. I said, you know what? He pulled the ring out. You had to ring. She was very cute about it too. She was like, I don't know what to do with. Both of them were very much like,

Speaker 7:          00:50:49       hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:50:52       Love it. So there you go guys. We get it balanced. We bring balance here on the HD podcast. This is too much of a roller coaster peaks and valleys. This I've told you, this is the premier experience on the Internet today. Maximum highs, maximum. Lowe's better help.

Speaker 2:          00:51:15       This one. Okay. We went from sadness to joy and now to rage. This next story is really is really made me rage full. We were covering the whole spectrum of emotions here. We have some college before we take this and let's get some serious. Yeah. Uh, we got a few. You want me to do a put one three, right? Yeah. Yeah. What's their name? All right. Let's see. How do I do it? Because I want to make sure that I can. Uh, I can shoot you the link if you want to right now. Send me on discord if you would please. Okay. Let me do one more story while you get that set up in the backroom. That sounds good. You're like, why don't you, uh, once you set me up an 87 year old woman gets tased while cutting flowers, Dan. All right, thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:52:11       That's what we've got coming. Shit doesn't work. You know what? Let's just says logged out. And this is a whole mess. I mean, how long is it gonna take. What do we got it. We got two seconds here on the clock guys. Hope you're all doing good and having a great time here at the podcast experience. We're logging into our call studio so we can get the feedback of the geniuses, frankly, that listen to the show, the great minds, the great minds out there that. Listen to this show. Dan, how do you wipe since we've got your hair? Uh, I, I do it the opposite of you. Uh, actually the norm, what I would say is traditional. Yeah, you're, you're a righty. I'm a lefty. Let's be frank. It's not that now, do you go dry or wet? I guess I go try. I mean, I feel kind of ashamed and, and kind of ashamed of.

Speaker 2:          00:53:02       We shamed normal. Which try a white ball now. Dan, do you ever feel that you just can't clean it? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And do you give up or do you wipe to the point where it's like, because usually with dry wiping your ass, you come to a crossroad where you're like, I give up too early or do I injure my anus? So where do you, where do you fall in that crossroad? Yeah. Um, no, I, I've, I've been there and it definitely, it's a risky road. I mean, I can, I'm like you. I mean I'm, I'm, I've got hair. So, you know, it gets rough. It gets real rough. Sometimes you take the uh, under wiping or the overwhelming, I got to say I probably do the overwhelming because that's the other way. It's not okay. That's not tolerable. So it's not really an option. Not for me either. No. Have you bled from wiping?

Speaker 2:          00:53:54       It may be. Maybe I probably don't check enough. I'm a little like, I don't know. I don't turn around and check out my business after. I'm not ashamed to admit that I've, I've bled from wiping. I have, I have to say what's going on here? I've got to grab their password. We this. Uh, we've, we've distracted. Then you've bled from wiping Ian. Have you bled from wiping? He said you now, Dan, you say May. Probably. Did everyone maybes an insufficient answer? I don't. I don't turn around and check. Do you not look? Every time you wipe, do you look at what point do you look? Occasionally you don't look. You don't look at the last wipe. How do you know your claim? Oh, I see what you're saying. Well, yeah, I guess. I guess in that sense I do look yes. But I'm not like taking. Thank you. Thank you. I fully take it out. I inspect it thoroughly. You have like a magnifying glass and they frankly, I even looked, I, I generally even look at the first wipe, right? Yeah. Yeah. He lives with me.

Speaker 2:          00:55:05       Thank you. Now, Dan, would you say that we all got our fresh uniform and has your finger ever slipped through the toilet paper? Because the what? I mean the driver didn't know Dan, so yeah. And then if so it's followed by like 30 minutes of scrubbing my hands afterwards. Good. Alright, we're in. Thank you Dan. Thank you for the anecdotes and fixing my computer and thank you to a thank you specifically to charms for the flushable wipes. Oh, I got to hear this. I'm kyle. I don't know if you're on the air. Tell me about the. Tell me about your life or not. I don't want to know everything but specifically about the lyme disease.

Speaker 14:         00:55:57       Oh Man. You Open?

Speaker 2:          00:56:01       Yeah. Let's, let's cut to the chase here.

Speaker 14:         00:56:07       Yeah, so I'm a geocasher or if you don't know what Geo caching is, say a little like cps based treasure hunt, a scavenger hunt type game and a lot of caching takes place out in the woods on trails and whatnot. So before I started this, I was never a, never a hiker, never spent much time outdoors. Um, so I quickly learned that, you know, you're on a trail for awhile sometime nature calls and uh, let me literally, and uh, you know, if you're like a couple miles from your car or something, a couple miles from a restroom, you just got to find a spot to take care of business. Um, so, so you had the first time that's happened. I'm a, I'm a, I'm a hairy guy, much like you. Um, so, you know, it's not, it's not, it's never good. Never comes out clean. So the first time this happened I, uh, you know, you always hear this and I, I always thought it was Kinda like a joke, but I don't know if you always hear this, but yeah, I use the least to kind of clean up the business factor. And a is not preferable, but I quickly learned because I mean, as far as my normal wiping routine goes, I'm a dry wet guy, so I'll go my first one, first one will be a toilet paper and then I got the baby was right by the toilet that second. And then I just kind of go back and forth. You kind of, it's a good way to kind of feel out the situation without having to inspect it after every white because I, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:57:40       so let's. So let's go to the, the pivotal moment of the story.

Speaker 14:         00:57:46       Yeah. So, um, this wasn't so on another occasion because I started packing toilet paper in my, like hiking backpack. But on this one particular occasion I had run out where I forgot it. So I do not have it with me. So, uh, you know, I live up in Rhode Island, we ticks, ticks are very prevalent thing up here. And when did these as well. So, um, so I've never had an issue with ticks on my life, but on this particular occasion when I popped the squat, did my business, didn't have the toilet paper. So I just did the leaf technique to uh, do uh, you know, kind of take care of things a bit.

Speaker 1:          00:58:27       Wow. Did you get a tick on your penis? Not In my anus,

Speaker 14:         00:58:33       but uh, like two days later I felt something. I think actually I felt something in my groin area to say that I don't want to talk about what I was doing.

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       What were you doing when you noticed the tick when you were jerking off?

Speaker 14:         00:58:56       You said that

Speaker 1:          00:58:57       Kyle, Kyle, were you able to send it? Did you finish when you, when you found the tech error or did you decide to deal with it at the time or later? That, that ruined the moment. Yeah. I couldn't see what was going on. I was in bed. Where on your groin was the tick located?

Speaker 14:         00:59:21       It was like right

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       in there. Like I'm a big dude so, you know, like I got some, I got thick thighs. Sure. So, so it wasn't, that's why I probably missed it because I always do like a check after it was like, um, like between the time it was deep, it was like, it was, it, it was in there and it felt like when you say deeper, was it under the balls? Was it between the balls and the thigh? Was it next to the peanut?

Speaker 14:         00:59:49       It was like, yeah, in the ball between the ball thigh area right over there.

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       That's how, that's how I felt. I felt. I felt that area. You might have been cutting your balls or something when you were jerking off. Right. To feel that there is something special for yourself, you gotta treat yourself. I totally, definitely. Most definitely. So what happens when you have a take there? What do you do? Good question.

Speaker 14:         01:00:21       Well, yeah, so I mean, you know, someone, you know, you spend time hiking and whatnot, especially around here, you know, you always hear about it. So I mean, I was freaking out, first of all because I never had a tick bite before, so I already knew the, the way you want to get rid of it when you want it, when. Yeah. So when you take it out, you don't want to like break the ticks body or leave that was in like underneath, like it's burrowed in the skin, like some of it. So did you, uh, the techniques? I use tweezers, pull it out and it,

Speaker 1:          01:00:53       you grab it and then you rotate it. Right,

Speaker 14:         01:00:57       right, right. Yeah. And it was tricky and hard to see. I mean I started.

Speaker 1:          01:01:03       Do you have, do you trim your pubic hair or are you fully a bushed?

Speaker 14:         01:01:08       It depends when

Speaker 1:          01:01:10       at the time, you know, and

Speaker 14:         01:01:12       when it's um, it was probably some Bush happening at that time.

Speaker 1:          01:01:15       Right? So the visibility was low. Oh yeah. There's a lot of bushwhacking going on. And so this, this son of a bitch gave you lyme disease.

Speaker 14:         01:01:27       Yeah, I started, wound really shitty, horrible. And now it's like why am, is a terrible thing? I mean, I don't have it as bad as some people, but it's kind of just with me now, like every year this happened about three years, two years ago maybe. And um, yeah, so like once every, you know, once or twice a year now, like I was, had like really bad migraine, like body aches just kind of shuts me down for like a day. It's just like with me, even though I went on antibiotics and whatnot, it's just something that sometimes it gets rid of it completely. Sometimes it just lingers.

Speaker 1:          01:02:02       So what is the kind of moral of the story? I'm wondering, don't, don't go out in nature. The moral, the moral of the story is, I'm not sure what, what does that mean? What is the, what are we getting out of this? Kyle? I'm not sure. I was going down a different path that I was fucking Ian and then somehow we got on this story. I liked it. I got to tell you. Well I'm sorry you got lyme disease. That's awful. But on the plus side, I mean the masturbating probably was, was definitely worked in your favor. And this time would have stayed longer, I would have been even worse off. So really. So is that the longer that ticks in you the worst? The lyme disease?

Speaker 14:         01:02:42       Yeah, because I hadn't quite another time like, and um, I noticed, I know for a fact I noticed it within like, you know, an hour. So it has for the most part people say it has to be in there for like 24 to 72 hours for that to be a transmitted.

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       I'm very glad it was in there for like two days. So very glad you decided to masturbate that on that when you did. And I thank you for sharing that story with me. But I'm also curious, what is it you said, what the hell are you doing out in the forest? You're looking for treasure.

Speaker 14:         01:03:21       It's a game, I guess hobby with my call. It's called Geo caching. So basically what it is is someone like me or whoever else, Geo caches hide the container somewhere out in the woods or out. So there's so many. I mean there are over 3 million of these geo caches around the world. Basically people go look for them, they use gps coordinates to find where they are. Once you're in the location

Speaker 1:          01:03:44       and then you have to try to find it. Is it, is there something valuable? Do you find what's going on in this box? Is it other than just text with lyme disease? You know, there won't be. It won't be.

Speaker 14:         01:03:58       The rule is if you take something out of it, you're supposed to put something back in.

Speaker 1:          01:04:02       Do you still.

Speaker 14:         01:04:07       Sorry, what was that?

Speaker 1:          01:04:07       Do you still geocache for you? God bless.

Speaker 14:         01:04:12       Yeah, it definitely has ruined being outdoors. I'm way more paranoid now. Whenever I am out in the woods. I used to like pick check only whenever I got back to the car after I was done. Now it's like every

Speaker 1:          01:04:27       20 to 30 minutes on the trail and like. Let me check. Yeah. Well thank you carl for sharing your story. I hope this is a cautionary tale that everyone out there don't go outside. I mean that's the moral that I pulled from this. I don't expose you asshole to the. To the, to the conditional. Right, exactly. Keep your asshole clean and cover my dues. Kyle. Thank you for sharing that wonderful story with us and I wish you all the best and I hope that lyme disease. Keep it. Yeah, keep cash in my dog. Okay, appreciate it. Thanks guys. Always. We always end with a wet. One minute. Thank you. Wow. That was an interesting man. We've got travis here who uses female razors for asshole shaving only. That's not that surprising. The same says he's a sandpaper in. What the hell is this?

Speaker 2:          01:05:20       He's shaking his head. No, he said. He said, where's the box guy? Is that guy still on? No, I just see travis talking razors and John who saw the handover. Oh, bummer. While we can. That was a great one. Happy with Kyle Up. This story mean it didn't. It didn't really add to our knowledge base, but it was a great know if we can join the great minds. He's not a great way to collect. I mean he's a poor minds collective. He got on a Dick, but he's a great guy and he's a funny guy. You know? Interesting guy. Kept living you guys. Never did the Geo caching thing that was like, yeah, I went on a few of those. We don't live in the house. If you haven't got what it was big like a while ago. Have you done. Have you ever done this thing of walking outside? Forget about Geo caching. That's way too high level.

Speaker 4:          01:06:14       Wow. Thank you, Kyle. That was a great story. Damn, you don't. I've got. I've had a tick before. Obviously. Maybe I have lyme disease. Maybe that's why I'm so lazy when. That'd be great to have an excuse now. It's dramatic, man. It's awful. Oh God. It's a fucking little creature burrowed, but lyme disease is more prevalent on the east coast. No, you're. You're good.

Speaker 4:          01:06:43       Why do. Anyway, Kyle love you. Let's move on. I'm 87 year old woman. Taste. Take the old bitch out is what I say. She had a common. I love these stories about place. Now let me. Let me. Let me say this guy. I respect police officers or respect the job. I respect what they do, but I have a lot of buts. First of all, you signed up for a dangerous job and you're well compensated. You can go work in a fucking cafe if you don't want to be in harm's way. Okay. Nobody asked you or forced you to sign up to be a cop. The same goes for the military and I'm sorry, but my opinions, the right opinions, and if you disagree with me, you're just clearly wrong. Why do I first of all

Speaker 2:          01:07:44       back when the story so people can join your 87 year old woman while cutting dandelion? There's no justification.

Speaker 4:          01:07:54       I'm going to tell the story though, but I'm on A. I'm A. I want to. I want to talk about the rant about the military. Oh yeah. Let me just finish this one point. As you tried to save me. Being in the military doesn't make you a hero by default, but thank you for your service. Thank you for your service. You signed up. Did it? Look, it's

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       a risky job. It's there. It's the first part. You Go. You travel around with a gun and hostile territory. Same with the. You walk around with a gun on your hip for a region, it's dangerous and you signed up for it. It doesn't make you automatically a hero and it doesn't mean that you have the right to never be in harm's way because the police training in the United States is basically if you are any risk shoot to kill deadly force when you're confronted with the 87 year old woman with a steak knife in her hand that was used to cut dandelions, which is adorable, as fucking gets to make a salad for a husband. God. So she's out there cutting dandelions and the police, first of all that she wanders across the street, she's probably a little, uh, she doesn't speak English and she was on some guy's property.

Speaker 2:          01:09:08       She probably didn't know it was, uh, it was the ymcas or some shit or the boys and girls club, but they call. She was probably a little dementia or a little senile. Right. So the guys, cause I have a recording, but he says she's over here with a knife and she seems lost. That's why he called. They're like, is she trying to stab people? He said, no, she's not dangerous. She's not trying to harm anyone. She seems lost. That's why he calls. So the police show up with arms with their guns drawn, screaming, you know, dropped. Can you imagine that? A sweet old lady with the little like steak knife cutting dandelions shredder was like, what's going on? So I'm going to tase you. Shredder looking intimidating like you cannot. You have to draw the line somewhere. You're signed up for dangerous job. Okay. You have to draw the line somewhere.

Speaker 2:          01:10:03       If some 87, that the choice between tasing and 87 year old woman and possibly receiving a knife strike from an 87 year old women, you have to weigh the severity of these two situations. Can you imagine this old, 87 year old too crippled lady, she's all fastigiate. All of a sudden she's like, Oh, I'm at 86. She's all strong and fast out to kill. No, the training is fucked. It's fucked. You are not entitled to a perfect harmless existence because you're a cop. You signed up for that job and I appreciate that. You're serving the community and you're doing this wonderful dangerous job that somebody has to do, but you could have gone, you know, you could have, could have done anything. I just feel like any normal person in that situation would like. The thing was that she was walking towards them when they said, drop the knife, drop the knife, drop the fucking dog. It's like if you were in

Speaker 8:          01:11:14       that situation, what will you do? You just, you'll let her walk to you and you'll deal with it. Don't draw guns. You put your down and say hi, can I help you? You okay? It's like an old lady. How about you just go and grab her hand and takes a knife out of her hand because she's an 87 year old woman.

Speaker 4:          01:11:30       How about you just do this? Are you okay? Take one. We'll shoot you bitch. There's a problem here guys. There's a problem with our police killing people.

Speaker 8:          01:11:48       She didn't die, but

Speaker 11:         01:11:49       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:11:51       She doesn't rush to the store. Spoiler alert either. You ruin the story.

Speaker 11:         01:11:57       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:11:58       That was a major question. Should this. After an officer in Georgia taste at 87 year old woman who was cutting the alliance with a knife, Steve Lipson saw me. His take. What's up for them? It your ass. Imagine that. Imagine that. Just look at her and so sad. She probably hit the floor like a bag of dirt. She probably hit the floor like a bag of dandelions.

Speaker 8:          01:12:25       She probably got injured. She got to fall in this age. Yeah. You don't heal very fast if you make a price. She's alive. I mean frankly speaking,

Speaker 4:          01:12:38       I mean God, look at that threat, that menace to society. Damn. She had a common woman is actually facing charges this morning. Oh, that's the best part. I didn't even tell you the best part. Well, I'll let them speak for it. She's getting charged. It is. This is a misunderstanding on so many different levels facing charges, but she has a court appearance next month, this 87 year old grandmother who doesn't speak English and is charged this morning with criminal trespass and obstruction of an officer.

Speaker 15:         01:13:15       There's no kids around telling me she doesn't speak English.

Speaker 4:          01:13:20       A worker at a boys and girls club in Chatsworth, Georgia called police Monday after seeing her walking with a knife in a field on their property, it turns out she lives across the street and this from Syria was a steak knife and she handled it with your family. Exterior was a steak.

Speaker 8:          01:13:36       It's attendance. Just a regular knife. Like a kitchen?

Speaker 4:          01:13:38       Yeah, no knife. And she was there picking Dandelions, which your family explains was meant for a salad for her husband. Police say she even had a bag full of weeds. Even the worker who called nine, one one that we'd deal, bitches got. We'd take her out, sprinkle a little crack on her. She was mysteriously found with crack on her.

Speaker 11:         01:14:01       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:14:03       This 87 year old crack attic pulled a weapon with a bag of weed on set. Wasn't threatening.

Speaker 15:         01:14:12       She came out with someone with a nice ride or did he just have it?

Speaker 4:          01:14:21       Police arrived with guns drawn, telling her to put down the knife, but say she wouldn't. They say they even threw a knife to the ground trying to explain. Put down the night. She won't put the knife down. They explained she wouldn't put the knife down,

Speaker 11:         01:14:38       got him

Speaker 4:          01:14:40       thing. What they wanted her to do. When she kept walking towards them, they shot her with a stun gun. The police chief was there during the incident, deployed the Taser rather than using deadly force. He says his officer acted appropriately. Her family says that her age, the shock could have killed her. She's recovering. Um, you know, it's still little. So Kyla, anyone. Nobody should be tasered but especially. Well, I mean if it's like a 30 year old man, a young 18 year old man, woman, sure protect yourself. But I love that the police chief comes out and is like, oh yeah, no, they reacted perfectly. We endorse fully tasing grandma's children. Really? If you're stepping towards us, we're going to take. If you're walking away from us, we'll still you. Yeah, we'll take you in the back.

Speaker 11:         01:15:34       MMM.

Speaker 10:         01:15:36       A little sore from what? She's gone through facing charges. And there's one thing we should add about that young man who was speaking out for the family. Robin, he is the nephew of this woman and he's a former police officer and he says, well, he understands why the officers use their taser. He wishes they had used a little more common sense. Yeah. Thanks for bringing that up, Steve. Very much. Yes. The nephew said procedurally the officers did the right thing, but it's kind of like being aware of the circumstance

Speaker 4:          01:16:07       procedurally. It's all good, but it's like it's an 87 year old woman. Love it.

Speaker 10:         01:16:16       Yes, and maybe it was a little tough. Sometimes everything is not exactly by the book.

Speaker 4:          01:16:22       Well, the best part she was being. She has to appear in court for like, I'm cruising around with a knife now they're going to charge her to make it look all kosher. Like let's just, let's not waste the justice system's time either. She's being charged with criminal trespassing and obstruction of an officer. You've tasted her bro.

Speaker 11:         01:16:47       So

Speaker 4:          01:16:50       I was at. Was that Rachel? You could say that pose revealed the UK that people want Edra Elba to replace Daniel Craig as double o seven James Bond. But here's the catch. Isla, he's black. Oh, he's a black man. Apparently that's caused a lot of drama. People say James Bond has to be white. Here's my take. You Want my opinion? Isla [inaudible]. You want to know? You guys want to know how to feel about this. I love it. I love, I love address Elba. I mean people voted for it. Well, what else do you need? That's the best part. This was a public vote and the UK with a list of five names and people voted for Idris and I love that. Now everyone's like, oh, you can't be bond because you're black. When I heard that, I was like, Oh, well, I love that. Not, not even. This is why I love this story so much. It's almost like heartwarming

Speaker 4:          01:18:00       how much people haven't thought about race in this because when I heard that I was like this, I just love him as an actor. He Suave, he's cool. He's a bad ass ever since I saw him in the wire. Then in love with him as an actor. I think he's great and I think he'd be an awesome double, like double o seven. I thought it was great. Um, but apparently a lot of people are unhappy with the, with the scoop. In fact there's a video that some grown man. Was it you said Dan about it, about her or in general it's like, well, here this Guy James Bomb. Let's watch this video first I guess, but let's see it. Somebody made a really great point here. They're like James Bond, English, American, Scottish, Australian, Welsh, Irish. It's like, oh, the other actors that played him. Yeah. It's like, it's like he's an idea. He's cool. He swapped, he's a spy. He's a bad ass of all the things I think about when I think of double seven white is not like number one. Oh, he's a white guy. Double seven white. Cool. Suave, like down at number 15 or something. I don't. It's not on the list. Right? You're like, I think he had top. If you ask someone as right, top 10 attributes of James Swan, if you write what you're kind of weird white,

Speaker 11:         01:19:33       make some great points.

Speaker 4:          01:19:36       Also, I love her intro. As Dan pointed out. To me the world is incorrect.

Speaker 11:         01:19:41       Ah, look at this. Everything is going

Speaker 4:          01:19:45       right. The stage is set. Hopkins world.

Speaker 11:         01:19:50       No

Speaker 4:          01:19:51       interests. Elva you shot is really powerful. Why is it okay? Here we go. Thanks. Bond. You will not be below seven. You say it like you will not be like. Is that how do you. Why are you so sure about that?

Speaker 16:         01:20:06       Over dead body? That's a how many tweets you put out saying, I'm Elba. Idris Elba. It's not because you're a gentleman of color. It's because a gentleman of color.

Speaker 7:          01:20:18       Hm?

Speaker 4:          01:20:21       You don't like black people deal lady or a gentlemen of Color.

Speaker 16:         01:20:25       James Bond isn't. He's written as an upper class. Our good white top form with a silver spoon in his mouth. Why can't that person be black?

Speaker 4:          01:20:36       Do you hear what you're saying? He's written as an upper class snobbish silver spoon in the mouth. Okay. Is that just white people?

Speaker 7:          01:20:48       Okay.

Speaker 16:         01:20:50       Shit. By Eaton and Sandhurst and well connected by his Swiss family fought tooth and it's not about talent address. Many people love you. I love how she's like ranting at him. It was asked to be included in this bowl

Speaker 4:          01:21:05       and he just made a tweet joking about it and now all of a sudden like he, he's getting shit for this poll where people made a popular vote that they would like to see him in it

Speaker 16:         01:21:16       almost more than you do yourself, but please can someone on your team come up with that own ideas or that own material? Must we perpetually crowbar in gender and color where it doesn't fit our imagination.

Speaker 4:          01:21:34       It wasn't his idea. First of all. And second. Yeah. It's like, it's like she's the one crow barring in race isn't a part of James Bond. He's just a guy. He's despised the coolest spot. The fact that he's black is incidental and he's British by the way. He's got a cool slick ash British accent when I think James Bond British is what I think, right? Not Black or white or whatever. He's a British spy. He's got a dope accent. That sounds cool. He fucks like crazy. He's a bad ass spy. And you look down the, you know that white snipey? Yeah. The sniper. Can we stop making everything about race? It's like no one was sounds good to me,

Speaker 7:          01:22:24       man.

Speaker 16:         01:22:25       Thing the way we love these characters maters as evidenced by the outrage. When someone attempts to mess with the things we love. So you see address. It's not about your color or you. It's about bond. James Bond.

Speaker 4:          01:22:43       How dare she say that? I love what you're directing it towards him. He's like, what the fuck did I do as an actor? It's some other thoughts, but it's already been a long something about it. You know? I disagree. I think you'd be great and I hope he gets it and I'd like to see what going to do about it. You will not be James Bond. I like to see what you're going to do about it. Lady. Going to find the footage and just destroy it. Sounds like a threat does. I love this. I love the term. Gentlemen of Color. Why do you. Why do you have to put it like that? Just say black dude. It sounds less weird. He's a gentleman of color. Have you met my friend Tony? He's a gentleman of color. Be like, what? That's weird, dude. Don't say that. Oh, the black guy, excuse me. They prefer gentlemen of color now.

Speaker 11:         01:23:47       Okay.

Speaker 16:         01:23:48       Evidenced by the outrage. When someone attempts to mess with the things we love. So you see dress. It's not about please don't attempt to thing and to mess with the things I love, which is being white.

Speaker 4:          01:24:01       Okay. How'd I do? Did I get through that? You need a writing up there every why? Yeah. Guys, listen, that's just my opinion. I don't think James Bond needs to be white. Oh, she was saying, wait, where do I saw this one video of someone saying that it was like as if a white person played a black role. What was that? I didn't see that clip or what? What did I see that Dan? I remember that too. It cracked me up. I was just thinking the last, a little chunk of that. Did you finish out that there was this great clip that just had me rolling where she was like, what did I miss? She says like, no, that's like having a a what? That's like having a white person play coon to Kente from roots. That's about race. Whereas explicitly about. That's about race. It's not the same. Get dumbed down. Let me try to find it.

Speaker 16:         01:25:02       I don't want to watch this video 20 times though. A short

Speaker 4:          01:25:08       Da. We watched this short one on twitter. All right, let's finish this. Fuck. Damn. We watched the wrong one. How could this happen? Why did this happen? Oh Man. All right. Let's pick up from here.

Speaker 16:         01:25:28       The Cold War era, and that's the glory of the thing. A throwback because James Bond isn't. He's written as an upper class, are really good white top form with a silver well connected to play Winnie Mandela. How would the bender and color where it doesn't fit and how come it doesn't work the other way? If I was to play Winnie Mandela, how would that go down? She's accounting.

Speaker 4:          01:26:01       I don't know. Why would you even. Why would you want to play? Man? I didn't know what she's talking about. It looks like she's like, what if I played a black slave? How would that go down? Pretty bad because it's about race. James Bond has nothing to do about race and power and identity and she's talking about the wife of Nelson Mandela, so it's like explicitly about apartheid. It's a fictional character that's a real person that's black about apartheid. And what if I played Hitler and a film, I think I would have said a lot of white supremacists and that's just not right. Frankly. I'm seeing as a cow what's the issue and if they cost money and I can watch her anymore. Oh, white shaft, bitch. Shut the fuck up. Shaft was a film. I don't need to Belabor this anymore. I think we get it right. I played the wrong one. I would like to see. Uh, would you watch white shaft dealer?

Speaker 7:          01:27:09       I actually don't know. I don't know if everything. Chef,

Speaker 4:          01:27:16       what is the chef? Sick. Let's move on. Grand jury. Oh God. Not this one. We can skip because there was a lot of stuff. Grand jury report. No. Ila. Our duty is to report the news. We are here to report current events and news and culture and to tell you guys how to think and feel. Grand jury report, Catholic priests ran a child porn ring and six Pittsburgh basically throughout Pennsylvania. This, this is shocking to me. I guess. Let's start with this video. This is horrifying. Wait, is this it here? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:28:09       Now this is. This is just plain evil. I mean, I don't really know what. How else would you describe this and Pennsylvania? There is an epidemic, an actual pedophile ring. Okay. I've just 300 priests. I don't know how many priests are in Pennsylvania, but I can't imagine more than like a thousand. I mean, I don't know what's the number but what does that. What does that 30 percent. That's a whole state and it just. It kinda pisses me off because you're seeing a lot of people. All these conspiracy theories about like satanic pedophile rings like this q and on and pizza gate and all this shit. Alex Jones goes off. He says the world is run by pedophiles, Bro. Look at your own fucking church. This is the most evil shit I've ever heard in my life. Yeah. How can you talk about pizza gate when the Catholic church is literally a safe, Tannic Colt? When you have 300 priests systematically abusing kids and Pennsylvania, everybody in that organization knows it's happening. Everybody, the priests, the that's part of the story is that they were covering up flat. How are they? I and I'm, am I supposed to believe that they're not all participating?

Speaker 4:          01:29:37       How can you let that evilness slide in the church like their whole thing is community and serving God and like, and so how am I supposed to believe that over the course of many decades, you can have that many pedophile priests. You're covering up and you're moving them around and you're not all in on it. Not just covering it up. Who is all in on it? Everybody. What do you mean everybody?

Speaker 4:          01:30:13       If 30 percent of the people that work for you or fucking kids, like what? What? What reason do you have to keep that system moving? If you find a pedophile, you kick come out and you'll apologize. When you have 300 and you're covering up, you're perpetuating a system that you probably want to keep going. I think there's a lot more of these guys fucking kids than just the 300 and it's just so funny and ironic to me that people will go slander and end date, say dangerous shit like pizza gate and um, basically make up stuff and on and all this shit. Say Obama is a pedophile when you have this like an and the shit that you're going to hear is going to make your sprinkler. I mean this is really evil stuff. So just prepare for them. And this is shocking. Do I sound like a conspiracy theorist? But I'm basing it on something. Well, I'm not sure. What are you? Everybody's in on it. Nobody. The fucking. Everybody. The whole church. Not the, not the people, not the congregation, but like all the priests, the bishops know the pope, the pope. People were saying, what was the last pope the resigned that never happened. People speculate that he was fucking kids and he didn't want it to come out. Imagine the pope is raping children and you're talking about pizza gate.

Speaker 4:          01:31:46       What do you really see? That it makes me think I do really care about kids, or is it just a political attack? Yeah, dude, this shit is so upset about child sex abuse by

Speaker 17:         01:32:00       priests. It found credible allegations exist against more than 300 priests and that more than 1000 child victims were identifiable. What is worse because of lost records or fear of coming forward, it is likely the true number of victims is deep into the thousands of Jean [inaudible] has been working on this for us and gene. Tens of thousands more massive investigation. Yeah, and it was with countless numbers of law enforcement, prosecutors, other attorneys within the office of the attorney general, and of course the grand jurors officials are saying that this report is the largest, most comprehensive document into child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church that has ever been produced in the United States. This report took two years. It was written by 23 Pennsylvania Grand Jurors who listened to dozens of witness testimonies and witnesses. You're studying documents about alleged child sex abuse in six dioceses, which involved 54 of Pennsylvania, 67 counties. The report states that the testimony was heard from dozens of witnesses and half a million pages of internal documents were subpoenaed. It also states that they were credible allegations found against over 300 priests. Over 1000 child victims were identifiable, but it's believed that the true numbers are way more, way more to the victims were boys, but girls were also victims. Some routines, some are younger, some were manipulated with alcohol or pornography. They were raped in various forms and fashions and grand jurors found the church leaders in every part of the state preferred to protect the abusers and their institution above everything else,

Speaker 2:          01:33:44       every part of the state, every part of the institution, every single time that's a church policy to protect the institution at the cost of the abusers, perpetuating a system. It's basically. What exactly does the Catholic Church do at separate kids? I mean, what exactly would you say you do? Catholic church.

Speaker 2:          01:34:16       Are you enjoying that tax exemption? I'm, I mean, I'm disgusted. I'm repulsed. Like I think it's time to close it down. I think it's time to lock shop up on that church. Imagine any other. Fucking. I mean, I'm really upset, imagined scientology. I mean, which I fuck. Imagine eyes. Imagine any organized religion being like, Oh yeah, sorry, we raped all your kids. You need to imagine what scientology. Yeah, but I'm saying if imagined this scope of like all the kids are being raped and scientology. Yeah. Watch day. Any serious bad example? Imagine. Yeah. Okay. Example, they're are all fucked up, but what exactly do they do there? Why are we giving them a tax exemption? Okay, this is evil. You guys. This is just actual evil. It's like like all the weird conspiracies you hear about pizza gate and like weird child sex torture and pain. Basements is happening in the Catholic church. I like to hear this because the coverup. What's most important goal

Speaker 18:         01:35:32       these petitioners

Speaker 2:          01:35:33       is Alex Jones ranting about this. I don't know. Maybe he is. I hope he is. That'd be pretty weird. If he wasn't. I didn't know how you can bring up pizza or cuing on and not this all day. I'm now. You can't talk about this all day if you care about pedophilia,

Speaker 18:         01:35:48       and for a time some of the diocese sought to prevent the entire report from ever seeing the light of day. In effect, they wanted to cover up the cover up. They sought to do the same thing that senior church leaders in the diocese we investigated have done for decades, burry the sexual abuse by priests upon children and cover it up forever.

Speaker 2:          01:36:15       The report states that because of the cup, okay, I'll let me. Almost all of the abuse is too old to be prosecuted. The Orange has issued present moments against two priests who was out of the 300, 300. They're only, they covered it up for so long that these guys have passed the statute of limitation and can no longer be charged extra for two. I mean, that's a criminal organization that knows what it's doing. Folks. Right? Round of applause to these guys. Let's give them tax exemption. Let's make sure they never have to pay taxes. Um, it gets crazier here. I'm going to read some facts here. I've got about this. This is a quote from one of the victims, George claims that the priest began taking photos of him on a camera. All the priest giggled, so there's many priests involved in this one location. Then added photos of him to a collection of other teen boys. According to the grand jury, these men and another priest who were part of a ring of predatory priests that raped children, shared intelligence of potential victims and manufacturer child pornography and parishes and rectories. This group of priests used whips, violence and sadism and raping their victims reads one line and nearly 900 pages of documents.

Speaker 2:          01:37:44       Hello. Is the whole world talking about this?

Speaker 4:          01:37:55       I mean, I know people are talking about it, but Dan just looked. He said nothing on info wars about it. I mean the stories a couple of days old, but like, hello. This is kind of insane you guys. Yeah, and this isn't just the United States. There's crazy in Argentina and Ireland. This, I mean there was huge stories about child abuse. It's like pedophiles are literally just joining the organization. We shocked sadism, whips and violence and sadism and raping, systematic raping. What I wonder if I'm religious people after hearing this would still send their kids do whatever it is they're sending them to. I don't know. It's a good question. It's the Catholic Church. I mean the Catholic Church. The pope,

Speaker 11:         01:38:58       right?

Speaker 4:          01:38:59       Where does the buck stop?

Speaker 4:          01:39:03       Where does the buck stop? Who's taken responsibility for this? Are we as a society taking responsibility for this that our kids and our citizens and our fellow, our fellow citizens, our children are being raped and the guys who did it are being covered up for so long that they can't even be charged. These guys are chilling dude there at our local parks and I'm not and I'm not and I'm being serious sin. What was the. What was I saying earlier? Serious as what? As a school shooting. I forgot what it was. Thank you. Dan. This world is so fucked you guys. Why are we not pizza gate? We have so if you imagine being this fucked there, there was a email about a handkerchief with a pizza and upside down. It looks like a pedophile. Are you fucking kidding me? Let me read this again. The group of priests use whips, violence and sadism and ripe raping their victims, but at the the handkerchief upside down, why aren't you talking about this genius? You don't need any more fucking evidence. My skin is crawling and there's more in the details of what they've done is. It's horrible. It's just horrible to read. The report said that meant here. This is. This is so fucked. If you could top sadism, I mean this is part of the sales reports, said that the priests gave a specific gift to children. They favored something they

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       could wear that would mark them as prime targets for abuse. He said, they told me that they, the priests would give their boys their altar boys or their favorite boys. These crosses. He. George told the grand jury, so he gave me a big gold cross to where that Mark Timm, so all the other priest knew he was fair. Game for abuse. Can I get another? Look at that handkerchief. There's no need for conspiracy as guys. This is as fucked as anything. Your imagination can comprehend. Almost every instance of abuse we found is too old to be prosecuted. Here's some more highlights and greenboro priests impregnated a 17 year old girl, fortunate pasture signature on a marriage certificate and divorced the girl months later, another precinct, Greensboro groomed middle school students for sex according to the grand jury by telling them that Mary had to bite off the cord and the lick Jesus clean after the activity. Well, what does q and have to say about the fuck? Well, nevermind this. I can't wait to see what, what, what? Obama and George Bush and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Let's hear more about their sex ring and Harrisburg. A priest abused five sisters from the same family and collected samples of the urine, pubic hair and menstrual blood.

Speaker 2:          01:42:34       This is like you've seen that show, true detectives. How it's like so sick and twisted beyond imagination. This is real. Nothing. Yet. You know the. The phrase stranger than fiction can't make this shit up and Harrisburg. A priests raped a seven year old girl who was in a hospital after her tonsils were removed and Pittsburgh. This. This is just the highlights that they got, and this is just one state, one area, and Pittsburgh Church church officials said that a 15 year old boy pursued and literally seduced a priest, church officials. That was their statement and the fence of the priest that a 15 year old boy pursued and literally seduced a priests. Well, I guess that clears that up. A church report later acknowledged that the priest had admitted to Sado masochistic activities with several boys. Are you sick yet? Yes. I feel that people about this. Everyone's just like, oh man, there it goes to Catholic church again. I'm ready to lock it up. I don't think these guys, their library card is being revoked. What's going on? This is the most evil shit I've read, and allentown a preset admitted sexually molesting a boy and pleaded for help according to documents, but was left in ministry for several more years. Priest rapes a child. He begs for help and they leave them there for several more years.

Speaker 11:         01:44:31       Hmm.

Speaker 8:          01:44:32       It's just, it's so horrible. And so how do you. Even when you even say

Speaker 2:          01:44:38       what I want to see action, because we've been talking about this shit for like decades and it's just getting worse and worse here. This is a wonderful one. And Alan's town, a priests who had abused several boys. According to the grand jury, was given a recommendation to work at Disney world by the church.

Speaker 2:          01:45:05       They conveniently left out the part where he was a convicted a child rapist. Would this priest be good? Uh, can we get a reference for his job at Disneyland? He's going to be in a mickey mouse outfit, taking photos with kids. Great Guy. Loves kids. Really? Really loves kids. Great with kids. Highly recommend. Well, and he wasn't convicted, right? None of these guys. Well, the church knew, right? No, no, no, no. That's too old, right? And Scranton. Isn't that where the office is? Sure. Is the electric city a pre? Oh, like God. A praise to was later. Serve prison time for abusing children was found to have been HIV positive for years. Like he would fucking care. According to CBS, uh, Pennsylvania grand jury report investigating the matter of states, the church officials gave a former priest a positive reference to work at Disneyland, even though officials field at at least one allegation about a sexual abusing a boy. The report says he worked at the theme park for 18 years, driving the train to the magic kingdom. Well, isn't that a nice, a little analogy. Pretty creepy. All aboard the ride to the magic kingdom.

Speaker 2:          01:46:20       His favorite ride. Peter Pan.

Speaker 11:         01:46:24       Oof.

Speaker 2:          01:46:26       Boys never grow up.

Speaker 11:         01:46:29       Thanks.

Speaker 8:          01:46:33       You know, this reminds me when I was a kid in my neighborhood that was like a religious neighbor that um, I guess they had like a, I don't know what you call it, where you go to classes when they teach you there, they talk about the Torah and they teach you. So like on Saturdays they would tell all the kids in the neighborhood to come and do they give a popsicles? Sorry. I remember wanting to go and my dad was like, he knows something was up. You're not going to this stuff. Because like now that I think about it, it's pretty weird. Why are you inviting kids and giving them pups?

Speaker 2:          01:47:12       Cool. Why do you want all the kids over there? Yeah. With like this irresistible invitation. Yeah. Oh yeah. It's so easy to be deviously hide behind religion. That was really slick of your dad by the way. Yeah. I wonder if people knew or if he just had the insight or if he had.

Speaker 8:          01:47:31       It's very paranoid about this stuff and for a good rhythm.

Speaker 2:          01:47:38       I mean it's. It's so ironic obviously that like under the guise of God and this whole institution of Christ is the most evil, evil, evil shit. We all agree and this society, everybody agrees like child rapists are like the worst. Right? We all agree.

Speaker 11:         01:48:01       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:48:03       Somehow. I mean at this point, if you give your church, if you give your kid over to the church, I mean, you're pretty much taking a crap shoot. Pretty much. There's like a really good chance they're going to get molested. Fuck that shit. Really. I don't know, man. It just pisses me off because there's all of these stupid fucking conspiracies that are ruined it with like so little evidence that it's. There's no evidence it took a total conspiracy that are fucking with people that have nothing to do with this shit and they're ignoring. It's making a joke of this serious actual or they're just using it as political attack and it's can't be more obvious than this because they're not talking about the church, but somehow Obama's pedophile, Hillary Clinton's a pedophile.

Speaker 11:         01:49:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:49:11       It's shocking, man. It's so evil, so fucking evil. How can you allow organization that's covered up that treachery, that evilness for so long? It continued to exist. They should be ran out.

Speaker 8:          01:49:26       I really wonder, what did the normal people think like actual religious people.

Speaker 2:          01:49:33       I would like to know, can we get calls of Catholics

Speaker 8:          01:49:40       like you got to assume that you're oppressed is most likely

Speaker 2:          01:49:43       a pedophile. I'm really curious what people are going to think mean. Everybody's covering it up at, uh, what's the, what's the number? Eight. Eight. Eight. Oh, eight. Dan hotmail. Eight hot meme. Which seems if there's any Catholics listening, I'm going to clear the call queue. If you're on the. If you're. If you've been holding. Sorry guys. You're getting hung up on. Deal with it. If there's a Catholic listening that has a strong opinion about this, give me a call. I'm interested in people that disagree with me. I want to hear how you think I'm wrong about the church this week. We with what they know. Well, I'm saying like close it down. So is it not as bad as. I mean it seems like unarguably bad, but either way I want to know what Catholics think about this. So meanwhile as we populate some, cause we've got the casting thing that I don't really care about honestly. And then we've got the this I do like Kevin Spacey,

Speaker 2:          01:50:44       Billionaire Boys Club movie came out and it earned $126 on opening day was a limited release who was on like 10 theaters but still okay with $126. That's like 10 people. It's actually less probably. That's just friends and family. That's not even friends and family. There was like thousands of people involved in that movie. Probably 126 bucks. Shit, you could make that work in that. Damn. That's fucked up. That one person can fuck up at home project, you know, for everyone involved. Apparently it was a really awful movie though. I saw in rotten tomatoes they had like five percent or something. So I mean the name billionaire boys club get a better name. That's got to be embarrassing though. You should have. I'm not going to say it. I was going to make a joke. It's probably inappropriate. As inappropriate as raping kids as a priest though. No, I feel like I should get a little more leeway on things.

Speaker 2:          01:51:57       Uh, well I am, has been a longtime February of the podcast at the podcast of the shell of HDHP productions. We've, I've enjoyed Williams antics because he's, as far as I, I mean he's musically talented, I guess not my style, but he's very socially challenged and, and he thinks he's very suave. He wants to be Kanye. He thinks he's Kanye. I think you're right. He is Kanye. But I am afraid he might be Kanye, but without the Yay. He's more of like straight up con now that I dunno, I dunno, I'm not gonna. Call him a calm, but he's definitely a goofball. Just kidding. So by my to the joy of this rabbit hole, we're going to go down right now. Is that I this video? And then I found out that there's actually a subreddit dedicated called cringe. I am. I was like, wow, this guy's prolific cringe or if he's got his own subreddit shit. Well let's start with this video. You'll tell me if you think this is interesting.

Speaker 13:         01:53:03       No, I know. I know. I know. Just can't decide.

Speaker 19:         01:53:19       Does not mean the folks that go home, we don't figure out how we work together. Um, so this is for the show and what I think will be great for the finals has nothing to do with how I feel about you being an artist moving forward. So that name is that name.

Speaker 13:         01:53:39       They're running at a time. Really running out of time.

Speaker 19:         01:53:44       Hold on. Wait, I'm gonna let Jennifer.

Speaker 13:         01:53:55       I know it's tough. Well, let's have a name. Well, that's really enough. It's going to be going to be

Speaker 19:         01:54:16       okay. Got It. This is the hardest thing.

Speaker 13:         01:54:19       Get on with it much to this show. And then when he says it, nobody cares.

Speaker 19:         01:54:32       I just want them to stop the music.

Speaker 13:         01:54:35       Tanya,

Speaker 2:          01:54:42       kind of a goofy and not that bad, but like it really more about the fact that there's a cringe I am subreddit. And so then I hopped on over there and I was like, wow, there is some good stuff here. So kind of want to go down the list of cringe. I am top of all time and now this one is really pointed. I would say it's very educational and maintenance.

Speaker 4:          01:55:07       Were you a little bit as well? Startup of the year guide, tip of the week. What makes a great logo? First off your logo has to be just as impactful in black and white. Kind of reminds me of that kid is like, you will.

Speaker 2:          01:55:22       You were, you got you got my dream is do you

Speaker 4:          01:55:28       sure if your logo is not? I mean then there's a problem. He has like his. I know very, very slick. His eyes or he can't make eye contact and he started on drugs or something collapses.

Speaker 19:         01:55:44       When you blow it up really, really big, then there's a problem. If your logo can't transform itself to other things and you still know what that logo is and there's a problem, so you should be able to have all those things.

Speaker 1:          01:55:59       What are they doing in the there two cameras and have a camera there and he's looking through that camera. They're not using the character but he's not supposed to. I don't think it's supposed to switch companies is not supposed to dark between the cameras. Now they show it when it's not like no, but you're not supposed to dark between the cameras. They just wanted like a nice profile shot and he's doing this.

Speaker 2:          01:56:20       He's doing like this, but I put that he's supposed to do with that. He's looking kind of in between them though.

Speaker 19:         01:56:27       The company's objective on a symbolic level. Right? Because you have to think of what India is going to do to the world. Right? We know it's silicone valley did to the world with him. We know China does for the world, but what India is going to do for the world is they're going to create this symbolic language because India is unique because they speak English.

Speaker 1:          01:56:52       He's talking about about logo. Yeah, he's talking about the logo, different alphabet.

Speaker 2:          01:56:57       Damn, he's on. He's on. He's on to something. I wonder what. I wonder how he wipes easier read jamming or what was the green? Jasmine Green. A Green Gentlemen.

Speaker 19:         01:57:10       So I don't want to pick up a red jacket. Going to add a whole new type of visual connecting language to the planning and symbology and logos are going to play a big role on that. Understanding something just by looking at a logo or different symbols, a new language, a new type of font.

Speaker 1:          01:57:35       I can talk and talk about it.

Speaker 2:          01:57:38       It doesn't say anything. Well, it's. It's really that, that ultimate saying all you need in life to be successful is confidence and ignorance. It's like if you have that unshakeable confidence, if you don't even think about anything you're saying you never consider what you're saying. You're going to sound to some people. Smart. Anyway. Do we have any callers? Let's see. Looks like we got one. What's his name and what do you think? Is this a call? You're saying he's got one on deck that he thinks will be better, so maybe hold off for a second. Okay guys. Well we've pretty much reached the end, but I want to take this call.

Speaker 2:          01:58:30       I'm canceling cable. I'm so sick of fucking cable. Me and Isla were let you know what? Let's get cable. We got it for the first time ever, like a few months ago and it's so stupid. Well we said, you know what? People like cable, let's try it out. It was almost nostalgic for me because I used. I remember like my parents are there. Could you just turn on the TV and something that will play. Like you don't have to choose all the time. Right. What to watch with Netflix and those kind of services, but oh my God, it's just commercial. Well first of all it costs like $120 a month. Okay. Which is more than double. Pretty much what it would cost that every streaming app, including like Hbo and Showtime

Speaker 6:          01:59:20       [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:59:21       So then there are so many commercials, like the other day I sit down for breakfast and it's at the tail end of the show and I'm sitting, I'm eating and I'm just watching commercials and it's like five minutes long by the time I'm done with my breakfast, the shows back on. And then let's say you don't like the show. You waited five minutes to see what it's about. Then you're wanting to switch the channel. Yeah, always it turns on on commercials and then it's like a knight of fire. If you just go channel up through all the main channels, you're gonna hit commercials about 50 percent of the time. The other 50 percent of the time you were about to go onto a commercial? Yeah. Like I can watch the same shows on Hulu without commercials. Why am I on cable? Why do I have cable? I don't get it. The only thing is that you can record shows, but I mean they never invented that dude. But like, and then the other day our recording thing wasn't working and it's not recording the shows we want. And I'm like, okay, so there really is no reason to have this. Then the shit that's on their flip flop flip and flop. Pawn stars flip or flop. It's like the dumbest shit that you didn't even know existed.

Speaker 2:          02:00:43       Like I'm happier knowing that these shows don't exist.

Speaker 2:          02:00:48       There's so many house flipping shows. Do we need more house flipping shows? You've got a gay couple. You got a black couple that a white couple. You've got one Asian, one red had a couple. You've got a couple of that's divorced. They're in Las Vegas. They're in California. They're in Houston or in Florida or the lottery. The lottery. That was one of definitely talked about this before we talked about it. I don't. I believe these shows that exist. There's a show on home on this. Oh, you must've talked about it. There's one called my lottery dream house where they get lottery winners and follow them to build their dream house with the lottery winnings. I'm like, how niche do you get? There's so many news. Twenty four hour news all day every day. So News. So many people with opinions. So many commercials. So many commercials. What am I missing? Hmm, what am I missing? Why do people like cable? Do we have a call yet? I'm just dragging on trying to waste time. We're good on that. It's been two hours. Okay. Gabrielle here. Hero. Is this a go and right? Gabriela? That's the one. All right, let's bring her in.

Speaker 2:          02:02:04       Gabriela. Thanks for giving us a ring.

Speaker 17:         02:02:08       No problem.

Speaker 2:          02:02:09       So tell me about. So okay. You, you've been listening to our conversation about the Catholic church. I have. Yeah. So what's your reaction to what I've been saying?

Speaker 17:         02:02:22       Um, a lot of reactions. So it's very interesting. I went to 12 years of Catholic school and I'm still a practicing Catholic. Um, my personal reaction is usually to just disconnect myself a little bit from kind of what's going on in the Catholic Church and just, I still go to mass. So it kind of worked a disconnect. That piece of it just to the priests, the people, the institution itself. Um, because then it kinda gets a little bit culty and weird. Um, but for me, since I grew up going to church, there's something calming about it. But you really have to work to remove yourself from what's going on because it gets down to like telling the priest will tell you how to vote and what you should believe, what stickley and you know, there's a lot of things that I don't agree with with the Catholic church, but I still practice and I still believe in the fundamentals of it. So as far as all the best.

Speaker 2:          02:03:25       Yeah. Good. I was just gonna say it. Was there anything that I said that upset you?

Speaker 17:         02:03:30       No, I think that I think that the sex scandals have been going on since I been very young. Um, and part of the way that the Catholic Church works is that there the priests move around from congregation to congregation before the sex scandal started or maybe because they started, um, but they move around from congregation to congregation to kind of mirror how the apostles moved around in preached. So it's a way of covering it up was, oh, this is moving to a different congregation when in reality I'm originally from Long Island, New York, or they would move them to upstate New York. So they would all be in one facility and then that's when the coverup would happen. Um, so my high school was actually, they just closed it down, um, and one of the bishops from that whole Pennsylvania scandal is actually coming to long island now. So it's been in the news quite a bit for us.

Speaker 17:         02:04:30       Um, so it's just, I don't even the cover up on some of this stuff. I don't know if you folks are into, um, some of those netflix series that go into some of the crimes, but there's one called the book about a cover up of a non in Baltimore where people were killed and shit. Yep. And I have friends that went to that church and knew that priests and their reaction to kind of the whole thing. It's just because the whole, the whole cover up when he was beyond the Catholic Church and into, if you have Catholics in the police force that it, you know,

Speaker 2:          02:05:13       just

Speaker 17:         02:05:14       gotten so out of control.

Speaker 2:          02:05:16       So. And, but you, you sound sympathetic to what I'm saying. You don't seem to have much conflict with my claims. No. So it's a, it sounds very cool to you though, the way you're describing it is like we've got Catholics in the police force, you've got them all over the place. They're all covering up. I mean it sounds very cold, like. Yeah,

Speaker 17:         02:05:36       it is. I mean if you talked to like some of my family that's very catholic very badly.

Speaker 2:          02:05:41       Well, what do your parents think about it? Because they're probably more old school. Like I want to know what's the dissenting opinion because I'm sitting here saying, shut down the Catholic church. I want to hear someone be like, I want to hear somebody say that's you're fucked. That's fucked up for saying that.

Speaker 17:         02:05:58       Yeah. I mean I would disagree with that, right? Like I wouldn't want the Catholic Church shut down. I would want to see some of the priests that were molesting children go to jail. I think that it's, you're not above the law, you know what I mean? But don't. But if you talked to what I'm sorry.

Speaker 2:          02:06:17       I mean,

Speaker 17:         02:06:18       um, if you talk to. Let's go ahead. I got my, I don't know. So you talked to like my Stepdad, he's very conservative. It's kind of like it's all over now. It's all over, isn't happening anymore. It's all over now.

Speaker 2:          02:06:34       Kinda in denial about it. They think it was a past problem that people are still digging up dirt. Yup. Yup. It's like if you're. I'm assuming you don't have kids right now, right?

Speaker 17:         02:06:50       I don't, but I have a nephew that was just baptized.

Speaker 2:          02:06:55       Are you worried about your nephew being around priest?

Speaker 17:         02:07:01       I mean I feel like you have to be careful with it, right? Like the Catholic schooling is a lot different now because there are a lot less nuns and priests period, which means that there's a lot of lay people that are teaching those classes. There's not really a heavy presence of priests. Like yes you go to school it on when you're in the service of like doing the office serving and the things like that that it seems a little bit more intense. Sketchy. But I did. I did date one person that anytime it was brought up but like fly off the handle. So you know that something happened and something like not great. So what were the results like? The longterm was also that, you know, even if you go to therapy to deal with it, I was still there. It's like any sort of abuse, abuse as abuse, it doesn't matter.

Speaker 4:          02:07:53       You sound, sound sympathetic and um, yeah. So, well thanks for sharing your story with us. Well, frankly, I, I mean the truth is if you have an instant, I, I'm, I don't want to get in an argument with you specifically because you didn't call to argue with me, so that's fine. But like if you have an instance, you say you don't shut down the church. Well first of all, constitutionally you can't shut down to church anyway. But it's like if you have systematic cover up, I feel like the institution has proven that it can be. Why does it exist? Why does it exist at all anyway? We don't have to. I'm not trying to argue with you, but thank you for calling God bless you. Appreciate Jugs and uh, wish you all the best I got. I'm not looking for people that agree with me for Christ's sake.

Speaker 20:         02:08:53       Okay. Well, I think, you know, most rational people would

Speaker 4:          02:08:56       have a hard time district. Well, I feel like what I'm saying is fucked up in a way because everybody outside all over the world and being like, shut down the Catholic church. So I'm trying to understand why what I'm saying is fucked up.

Speaker 20:         02:09:09       Well, I think the, the one point she made that was interesting and it's probably true for most is that because you know, that this particular story is about instances that happened in the past. I think a lot of people would probably think, oh, we, we clean this up. It's not like this anymore. You know what I mean? Um, which may or may not be true. I don't know. But that's probably how they rationalize it.

Speaker 4:          02:09:29       Hmm. It's hard to know. It's tricky. It's really tricky. Got To be careful on there when do your kids. But isn't that fucked up the first someone who's an active member of the church to be like, you gotta be careful. Whatever. Alright. I've said my piece about it. So disturbing story, shreddies gone nuts. Starting to shred cables here. So guys, thanks for listening. Hope you enjoyed this Tuesday episode. This is the. Let me tell you what to think and feel episode. Those are the Tuesday episodes, the right opinion episodes. Remember guys, there's not much time left on these represent shirts. You got an in black, you got an entire night, you got a Hoodie, you got the extra thick hat on like four days left or not even less, right Dan?

Speaker 20:         02:10:28       Yeah, I think it ends Friday at noon. So yeah, about three days.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       And make sure to gut it. Teddy fresh.com/collection/sale. That's happened. Mouthful. You'll figure it out. Having a 50 percent off sale. That's insane. And how do we do to release some new items finally? Pretty soon. In about two weeks. Oh yeah. We're going to make a video. Kind of a preview for Ethan and yella before. Maybe not. Maybe. Definitely. I'm excited. You don't want to. I just say maybe because we haven't posted in so long. I don't even. It's like a blog that would just be like a Bot. How do we do? How is this episode was good? Emotional rollercoaster, like you said, I always feel like an asshole, like expressing strong opinions. What is the. This is the. This is the strong offended therapist while you watch the show and I will be spending a lot of time on. I'm better help. I need so much time on better home. It was fine. It was good. You see how fucked up I am you guys. I'm having a dialogue on. On camera. Will you just do this off camera? I usually shop for Cameron. Be like. Was that okay? You guys. Was that show? Okay. Roll up and go. I want you guys to see just how insecure and how neurotic and anxious who a person I am on camera, because that's what this podcast is about. People say,

Speaker 7:          02:12:01       you know,

Speaker 2:          02:12:06       look, now he's chewing on. That is so cute. You're so fucking cute luck. You can say I'm an asshole. You can say I'm a Jew. When you says an insult, that's not okay. That's true. You can say whatever you want about me, but I feel like

Speaker 2:          02:12:27       this is as real as it gets. This is live, baby. There's no take backs. I might sound like an asshole. I might sound like an idiot. I might sound uneducated, might sound racist, but this is as real as it gets. There's no take backs. This is live. Okay, so forgive me if sometimes I sound stupid or offensive or you think. I mean, there's no editing it out. It's all off the cuff. This is live. This is who I am, just like garth brooks said, and that's just who I am. There's no hiding from me when it's live me for myself, when there's no hiding from it, there's no hiding from myself when it's live. And so I want you guys to see how neurotic and insecure and anxious I am because the truth is, you guys probably think I'm a perfect cool ass dude. They just confident always. All right, just fucking good. Cheering on your shoe. Now what is a trump? But the truth is,

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       boy, don't feel like that guy ever and think is important for you to know that. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:13:43       Alright. Alright. Only soundboard I need is to get on my. Shut my ass down.

Speaker 4:          02:14:00       Alright. I hope you guys enjoyed it. Please let us know if you did or didn't really want to know if they didn't. I mean if everyone's like, I didn't enjoy that, that I should probably. Listen. Dan will filter comments to me. That's how insecure and fragile I am. I don't, I can't. I literally can't even see it. That's how fragile I am. You Bet. I want you to know I am a fragile. I am petty. I'm insecure and I'm deeply unhappy. What you do. I brought in the, uh, the podcast theme song, which is very upbeat as you're playing right now. So I'm just gonna remember that guys. I'm not A. I'm fucked. Probably more than you are not a Dick measuring contest. I wasn't going to say have a nice weekend. Not a weekend and weekend. That's what I'm saying. But this Friday we've gotten Bert Kreischer, which I'm excited about. Super Funny. He's super great guy. We finally get them in the podcast. He's one of my favorite comedians and hilarious and shirtless. I wonder if he's going to wear a shirt. That's a good question. Actually. I prefer shirt speaking frankly, but I leave the choice to end. I think he wears a chef probably eight a day. He shared it, so tune in on Friday at our usual time. I hope you guys enjoyed this and you've been filled in with the right up in. Thanks for watching.
