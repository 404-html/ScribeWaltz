Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Come to your five or three. Two.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       Hello everybody. And thanks for coming to the AC pod.

Speaker 2:          00:00:14       That's my announcer voice. Hey everybody. And someone's just your voice. It's not that different all the time. Happy thanksgiving. So thankful for you all. Joining us here today. We pulled into the parking lot and there was nobody there and I was like, Holy Shit. It was difficult. I would tell you it was difficult to come in today. I had a big ass meal. I could barely move, but we did it. We came in, we did it. So thank you. So God bless. Today's episode is sponsored by postmates dollar shave club and Vince Sero. How was all of your thanksgiving? How was your thanksgiving? You luckily you made, I know her food. Yeah, so I enjoyed some food, but I don't like the Thanksgiving food. You know what? Can I make a confession? I don't like Turkey. It's the most boring meet imaginable and it's like the Gamey.

Speaker 2:          00:01:15       It's dry usually it's just, it's not there. It's just now it's not a word of the bird. And you read it with the cranberry, cranberry. What else? I know there's people at home who were like, yeah, I know it's a very polarizing thing. I don't like stuffing. I don't like cranberry. I don't like Turkey. But I took Thanksgiving it to my own hands because I said, you know what? I'm going to make a pot roast and I would like to call these Ethan's heavenly potatoes. True cause I wanted to make sure isla could eat and what Ethan's heavenly mashed potatoes and let me tell you, okay, I'll tell you what's in it. But that doesn't do any good because it's all about the technique. When people see what's in it, they can't believe that it's going to taste good. Well sure. And you should be, you should be horrified by what I put in it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       But that's the secret to every good restaurants cooking, you know what I mean? Is that's why food at restaurants tastes so unbelievably good. It's because if you actually went back there in the kitchen, you would never have the balls to cook food the way they do. Like, you know, putting a whole stick of butter and for like two eggs scrambled eggs, you're like, oh, these scrambled eggs are amazing. I never had my eggs. Never tastes like this before. There's a whole stick of butter. So what I do is I put a whole stick of butter and a whole block of cream shoes for every four potatoes. So yesterday was two. Yeah, there was eight potatoes to a whole sticks of butter and two whole blocks of cream cheese. And I hear dad freaking out in the back, but I'm talking, I mean that sounds bomb, but it is bombed Dan.

Speaker 2:          00:02:58       It, it just tastes like potatoes. It doesn't even taste crazy airy. It's a slight, it tastes incredible. You can eat ham mouthfuls of mouthfuls and little do you know that every bite has probably 200 calories. I love mashed potatoes is the best dish you ever like potatoes by themselves are already pretty unhealthy, but then you like, or like heavy, heavy, let's say. There's just nothing really good in it I guess. But it's not unhealthy. No, I'm not a nutritionist. I'm not even gonna claim that. I don't make claims on this podcast anymore. I don't know. What's funny, I didn't even know that. My name is Ethan. I cannot confirm or deny that. My name is Ethan, allegedly. Allegedly. My name is Ethan and it was Thanksgiving yesterday. Don't hold me to that though. Um, and come the expose videos about my name not be, um, anyway, these potatoes aren't credible or hit. I got this pressure cooker instant pot. Have you guys heard of this? Whole crazy, I had two massive pot roasts. I put in there for two hours.

Speaker 2:          00:04:03       I got to tell you, nobody cared about the Turkey. I had a pity bite just so my sister didn't feel bad. Your sister cooked all them bay, not Turkey. I know. And that's what I'm saying. When you came in two hours, I pop it in, I set it and forget it. And all of a sudden it's a smash potato heaven. I care so much about smashed potatoes, mashed potatoes, mashed potatoes, and it's so important that they be right. You know, and on all day, but and add any, right. I hope you Dan, how was your thanksgiving?

Speaker 3:          00:04:34       It was great. It was really nice, actually saw a bunch of extended family I haven't seen in years. So that was cool. And uh, yeah, it was nice. Good food. You're vegetarian. Were they able to accommodate you? They did accommodate. It was very nice to them. Um, the, uh, the wife of my uncle, I guess my aunt in law, if that's the thing. She's a vegetarian too, so she hooked it up. So thank you to that. What is, what is the vegetarian eat on Thanksgiving? Uh, well, I mean most of the sides are vegetarian and they, they made sure the, like the stuffing, you know, usually the stuffing isn't vegetarian, but they made vegetarian stuffing and you know, the cranberries and I know you, I know how you feel about it.

Speaker 2:          00:05:12       Yes. And in Anzac, everyone had a good time. Everyone's happy. Everyone's satisfied, I hope.

Speaker 3:          00:05:19       Definitely. Yeah, it was a, I mean, I'm not a big fan of Turkey either, but who is, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:05:25       no, I mean some people like it. We're also not fans of the pies. So there was a bunch of Pumpkin pie and I don't, you know, I don't want to offend too many people here. I know I'm going to start a whole new way of, of uh, but I don't like Pumpkin Pie, but Ian about it and he made a chocolate pie. Thank God for that. Well, at any rate, listen to, um, but that's not enough of that. I'm glad everyone had a happy Thanksgiving and I'm glad you're here. What black Friday as you all know, let's get to the real business, which is today, right? Yeah. Today's black Friday. Oh yeah. Good. I got, I got to appreciate this top light. Like it's so amazing how the sandwich and then like first of all you've got this beautiful thick ass and then even the hand and the top right.

Speaker 2:          00:06:20       Oh, perfect. It's just incredible. I actually had an awkward moment with this because a, I was looking at my phone at Thanksgiving and saw you tweet this and I started laughing my ass off and immediately my family like, what are you laughing? What are you looking at? I would like, I was like, I don't really want to show you that. Do you consider the picture of my boss? Here you go. You consider this open face sandwich, not safe for work then I, yeah, that's why I was like, to be honest it's a little lewd, but that's fine. It, yeah, that might have to be, that might have to be switched. Not Safe for work isn't very gross to you and naked except my balls drip down to the bottom of that toast for that. Um, J that James Bald double o seven. You're, you're alleging real dude. See y Ella likes me.

Speaker 2:          00:07:07       So today's black Friday and there's a tradition in America to stomp the face of every grandma and the way of your new ps four. But I have to say this year we had a mellow, mellow year. I didn't see any fights. I didn't see any babies thrown across walmart. I didn't see any, uh, ambulances picking up 90 year olds, nothing like that. I think the stores have finally gotten smart and it's more like the older videos are surfacing again. Yeah. Cause we have our craving those uh, yeah, I noticed that. Yeah. There's all these slick guys on Youtube. Just they re upload all the old shit and they say Thanksgiving Black Friday, fight 2018 and disable the comments and then every year. But there's no really juicy, fresh a fight. Memes. I think enough people died and got trampled. When I watch those old videos, I'm like my God, how did they not they you need to have order in your store. But what we did find was some free. So what I've got here is a little segment called black Friday around the world. Yes. Um, here we go. I've got USA, Canada and Brazil. How do you think this will go? Let's start in the United States and see what black Friday is like there.

Speaker 4:          00:08:25       This one, I couldn't tell if it was from this year because there's, so again, people are starting pretty calm leading. Exactly. Excuse me. He thought, doesn't it look like at night? It just blows my mind. Imagine him waking up at three M. I mean we tried once,

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       but we didn't make it. I mean, this is your day off. This is Thanksgiving Day. You spend your day at 3:00 AM trying to find most of the sales on line. No. Yeah. You don't need, I don't know. Some places do these crazy in deals, but it's like they're trying to start a riot, you know? Yeah. You got it. We need to order Walmart. Oh, we're supposed to play the thing, right?

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       Yeah. You got to hit me with that. Zach, did Zach Know Walmart theme song? Oh, he does? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:09:29       You guys met with that. We thought this was good. Everybody. Yeah. Well one my hey, throw it up now.

Speaker 6:          00:09:47       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:09:48       that's right. Absolutely. For audio listeners, there's just hoards of people grabbing Kellan nearly in a riot. You're of people jumping over escalators from grabbing television lenders. I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:10:20       there you have it. There you have it. So that is black fret. You want to watch that Ila? Yeah. Not like we have anything better to do. My favorite right now we are. We are Walmart. Yes sir. Those everyone would lyrics. Oh, you serious? And when you typed it and I love that.

Speaker 4:          00:10:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10:45       I guess a manager at Walmart wanted to do a little hype video for their people. They get excited for black Friday. I think it was the day. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:57       Has the best. This has employee in the century. Nobody gets paid enough to do this. Now I kill myself.

Speaker 6:          00:11:13       That's right. Uh, we uh, Walmart.

Speaker 4:          00:11:20       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       They just gave this guy a 25 cent raise. He's all stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:11:36       Did he say he got blood on your face? What? I was thinking you have

Speaker 2:          00:11:40       blood on your face. Is that what black Friday is for them?

Speaker 4:          00:11:50       Oh, you're going to be be a cashier

Speaker 2:          00:11:52       some day. Really dream. Dream big. What do you got on? You're going to be a cashier someday. You got blood on your face.

Speaker 4:          00:12:01       It would be, oh, you love this.

Speaker 2:          00:12:05       Okay. Yeah. You got blood on your face. You love this place. Really? Because those images seem contrary. Hmm. You'll be a thing. We did the one with the lyrics. You're right. We need this to cut it. What's that one? What's that one? Youtube channel. That d codes. Lyrics. Genius. Genius though website. We need a genius. A on Walmart fights on analysis. You, you may be a cashier someday. If you play your cards right at Walmart.

Speaker 4:          00:12:44       I want to hire two more times. Give them a great, I think this guy's doing this bullet for, I'm pretty sure this constitutes cruel and usual

Speaker 2:          00:13:01       punishment and constitutional under the United States law. I love that quote. That's great. So here you have it. Black Friday in America. God bless these wonderful country here we have black Friday and Canada.

Speaker 5:          00:13:19       It's, it's crazy. I love this orderly. They're getting a round of applause. That's fine. Looks like congratulations on wasting your holiday. Well, they're Canadians. Look how wonderful this is. It probably served coffee. They're just walking in super orderly and calm. The employees are lined up and giving up ground look like giving high fives and then have a five. Wow. What a, what a joy.

Speaker 2:          00:13:48       What a thrill. What a thrill. Um, you know what I was thinking, I was watching that it just takes one lunatic to start running and it sets off that chain reaction. No, no, no. Probably. Well, you, I think if one person from the bottom started cutting and running a front, that's it. Full riot mode and America, you got five of those from the beginning and nobody ever had a chance, but there you have it black Friday and Canada. And now finally, as you all know, Brazil is as a crime ridden country. There's huge disparities of very rich and very poor. Lots of corruption. It's a rough place. So black Friday in Brazil, as you can imagine, there's going to be one of the craziest things you ever see. And so I warn people with young children and who are sensitive to trigger warnings to a divert their eyes from this very graphic scene.

Speaker 5:          00:14:44       Black Friday and breasts here. But I see it. I got the mascot. Some girl was, I don't know. Yeah. Um, yeah. So they're, all the employees are lined up at the gate and they're about to start pounding it to get everyone outside super heightened. When here we go, they got a Dj by the sound of this. They're pounding on the wall. Get ready everybody. Here we go.

Speaker 4:          00:15:19       Well, it's going to come through shit

Speaker 5:          00:15:30       completely empty. There's not a thing of person outside, not even one single person out that nobody's there.

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       Incredible. I wonder how they missed this violated or got in trouble for it. Yeah, we're going to get the monetize for sure. I find it fascinating that nobody peeked outside. You know what I mean? I love how they're pounding on the gay and there's got a Dj in the mascot, not even one person got the memo, not even one person. So there you have it. And Lou have anything interesting to talk about this black Friday, black Friday around the world. And on the topic of Thanksgiving, we are a very topical show. If nothing else. Barney at the Thanksgiving Day parade, macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. Excuse me. Thank you though. In 1997 was murdered. So the lane gunned down by the New York state police and we talk a lot here on the show about police brutality. Well this is police brutality. Uh, the worst I've seen

Speaker 5:          00:16:46       and a long, long time. So this is more of a, a memorial

Speaker 2:          00:16:50       for Barney. Oh, this is amazing. Actually. So it was really windy winter day. Um, and the bar new flow, just it

Speaker 4:          00:17:00       so out of hand.

Speaker 5:          00:17:11       This video reminds me of Gulliver's travels then people, oh yeah, the rope over. I'm in there trying to take him out.

Speaker 4:          00:17:25       Hi.

Speaker 5:          00:17:25       This is probably the most, well, the people on the ground. I also barneys floating everywhere. He's completely out of control and people on the ground or wrestling. It's almost like a dragon. I feel like I'm watching a movie. The logical battle I'm trying to like, well, a mythical beast. Um, let me skip to where it goes. It's

Speaker 4:          00:17:48       real spicy.

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       The crowd is a balloon as they should be. This is, you can see that people. Oh Wow. Why is that rope filling? Everyone's dressed up at, it's a bunch of young. Oh, I thought they were all ladies, but they're just up is like gnomes or something. What's he going to hang it off? Even literally got people just as gnomes clinging onto ropes for dear life. I mean, it's incredible. Hi, this is the site of Santa's workshop that we have not seen before. The dressed is Barney. Yeah. Oh, Barney's Barney. Barney's holding I, but they were known Stan. Why can't they?

Speaker 4:          00:18:31       It could be no. Ooh.

Speaker 5:          00:18:34       So I wonder if you would get mad and then it splits. Hawaii don't fit under the Gust of wind. They fighting to quell

Speaker 4:          00:18:42       beast.

Speaker 5:          00:18:44       You're like a five year old. You Love Barney music. The audience is losing their mind because this is the most exciting thing they've ever seen in Thanksgiving Day parade.

Speaker 4:          00:18:55       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:18:59       You think you could get taken out if that thing just tumbled into the crowd? It's massive. Probably. Yes sir. They fill those up with helium. Is that what they do to make them flow? My bad. So yeah, because it isn't a hillary, I'm like a precious resource, like a lot of helium. I'm sure that pressures, I've heard that it's a finite resource that cannot be replenished. So that was a good thing. We're using it for important things. Yes sir. Barney Barney, uh, this is when it gets really violent. And again, I have to give a trigger warning here for people. We're sensitive. The violent, uh, content because as you're about to see the boys and black, the police are about to make a violence slang of this innocent bystander. I mean, what did Barney ever do except try to entertain the kids in here? He has been gun down, taken down in cold blood. I mean, he's just a brother trying to live his life. You know what I mean? Just trying to enjoy the parade. Got It. Bring the dinosaur down. Humans always keeping the dinosaur down. I mean, God, there's no justice in this world.

Speaker 4:          00:20:17       You know,

Speaker 5:          00:20:21       I need some human rights activists to take a look at this foot. Yes. His body is splitting apart. Yeah. If you're a Barney lover, this is got to be some traumatic footage. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:20:34       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:20:40       Here come the police guys. So again, sensitive morning here, here they come up with a foot. They starting to stab him at the feet. Please. Oh, oh, this is, I got, I gotta commend these brave officers. Honestly climb on top of that with a knife. That's pretty daunting. Does it remind you of Goldberg traveled like it seriously feels like they're bringing down a dragon or some shit. It's kind of mythical. You're right. Yeah. And on the day of November 22nd, 1997, the dragon was plain. They decapitating him look out there, cut again. And their gap with dating goes, where's Jesse Ventura? Brutal. Brutal. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:39       Exciting. I had never seen that before. Kind of a thrill. Kind of a joy on this beautiful thanksgiving day either. What do you know about thanksgiving? Because you are an immigrant to this country. Uh, you know nothing about no. The Turkey. Oh, and you say thanks. I think that's probably what most people know about it. You know, we never said thanks at dinner. That's true. Should we do it now? No. It could be exciting. What am I thankful for? What am I truly thankful for? Well, clearly you.

Speaker 7:          00:22:15       MMM,

Speaker 2:          00:22:16       clearly I'm thankful for you and everything good in my life was a result of, um, I'm thankful for this is so long. Yeah, we want to do it, but it's great, isn't it?

It's just on the long shot because he's buying all these anthologies. My resell these. I like that. And I do like that. So the, here's a story that I absolutely love. Dude wants to legally change his h. Why does he want to legally change his days from 69 to 49 because it will help him get more dates on tinder. Oh my God. Understandable. At 69 69 that's right. Here we have it here. There's about a little video about it because a legend man, you just try to fuck. He's like, dude, nobody wants to fuck a 69 year old. Well my Dick, I got a 49 year old. Dick is still 69 we can 69 but I'm 49

Speaker 9:          00:37:26       and I, I feel I suffer on the my age because I'm much more younger. Demos 68 so when I ask for a mortgage, for example, they say, is it possible if I go on tinder? You know,

Speaker 2:          00:37:38       I never thought about it that you can't get a mortgage at all age cause you'll die before he can pay it off. Oh, isn't that gnarly? Wow. I never thought about that. Yeah, this guy, he's 49 you're could live, but I guess they don't take the risks. They're like, did you want a mortgage? You're 69 ish. I'll give you five years tops the mortgage bankers like you want a mortgage? I'll give you a 30 year

Speaker 9:          00:38:04       from 68 or 69 when the woman are there and when I'm mocked in the, you know the, then they say, okay, then lie for your eight. You say you are 49 I don't want to lie, I want to be myself. So don't force me to lie. But when I am really 49 again, I will have a baby again. I will buy a new car again, I will pay my house again. I go outside and I invest my money again because now I'm old man. You know, I have to save my money to give to my kids so they can live. But if I have that h

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       I have hope again, I'm new again and there is the whole future is there for me again. All right. Iron clad logic right there. So I wanted to say, well I, I know there's been a lot of debate about changing genders and this kind of whole thing and that gender is a construct, a social construct and people changing sex. And all this, you know, we can debate about, uh, we can debate about gender roles and that old things time however I think is indisputable, at least right now as far as we all know, time is a linear fact. I don't think we're time traveling yet.

Speaker 2:          00:39:20       He's like, he described himself as a young God is he did you, he said a 69 year old, he's a positivity guru. He says he does not feel his age and it started a battle to make himself illegally 20 years younger on the grounds that he's being discriminated on dating apps. Doctors told him his body was that of a 45 year old man and he described himself as a young God. Yes, that judge expressed skepticism, but also noted that changing the sex on a birth certificate as a transgender people have the right to do that, which was once impossible is now allowed tension or people around the world have fought long battles of the right to change their birth certificates to match their gender identity. Where this is permitted, the legal requirements vary in the Netherlands. Transgender people need a statement from an expert affirming that they have a purr, purr, permanent conviction that their gender does not match what is on their birth certificate and that they understand the repercussions of their decision. But again, here, you know, that's uh, gender is a kind of an abstract idea in a sense that it's not a physical the idea. But here we're talking about age.

Speaker 7:          00:40:37       I mean

Speaker 2:          00:40:39       we can debate age, right. But apparently the judge is actually, it's unlikely to happen, but the judge is like open minded about it too. I mean, what, what, what, what does our world be when people decide their own age? Like a 13 year old or like an 18 old being like I'm 20, I am actually 21 it's an emotional age and they call it an emotional age. Dude, what's wrong? Uh, imagine. Uh, I you do it.

Speaker 7:          00:41:15       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:41:19       I like he, oh, he almost talks that if he was able to change his age to like 45 that he'd be like, he's like my Dick will work again. Yeah. And like it will like magically like actually reverses age. I can get a mortgage, my Dick will work there. You have it. What do you think? You know that's a weird one. He looks pretty good for 69. I'll give him that. Maybe he is a young God,

Speaker 8:          00:41:48       but you should embrace. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:41:53       I think his problem is that would look old for 49. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, that's 20 years and once you're that old, every decade is like hit you harder than the last. I think he's just like, I don't want to fuck, I don't want to fuck 69 year olds. He's looking on tinder. It's all these old ladies. He's like, I want to fuck these hot ass 49 year old, these four. Have you seen these 49 year olds? They're banging their hot as hell. My Dick will work if I could only change my age. Uh hmm. Do you think he really believes it or is he, is he full of Shit? Well, you had mentioned damn that it was some what, what? Uh, I, it's hard to say. All the articles I've read, it seemed to take it very seriously. But you've said that you had read something that it's some kind of protein.

Speaker 3:          00:42:49       Yeah, I thought I had seen somewhere that he's, he's trying to, um, yeah, I mean like you, you brought up the whole gender issue thing. I think he maybe is trying to make a point about that. But yeah, I mean like you said, I mean obviously it's pretty fucking difference session. Awful. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:43:07       You know, I see people always trying to make this

Speaker 8:          00:43:08       my, are you really gonna compare that to a gender issue?

Speaker 2:          00:43:13       One is like measurably wrong. Like, okay, you're by people who will say, Oh, you're bowling with the Dick. That makes you a man. But still you can identify more as a female and so there's a debate to be had and some empathy and understanding and you can physically change your sex. You can remove your penis and surgically implanted vagina and you can assume the identity of a female and you can be

Speaker 8:          00:43:37       born with a certain genitalia, but it's kind of like in the middle.

Speaker 2:          00:43:43       What do you, what do you mean, like a peanut? You can be both like an inverted u. There are some people that are born with both.

Speaker 8:          00:43:49       Oh yeah. Or like stuff like that. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       correct me if I'm wrong, Dan, but wasn't Jamie Lee Curtis born with both a vagina and a penis? I swear. I swear, look it up. I'll look it up. Jamie Lee Curtis, super famous. Uh, uh, she was like a babe. She was like one of the hottest babes in the 90s. Let me make sure I'm saying her name right. Yeah, that's her. I think she was born, uh, with a, with a both a penis and a vagina.

Speaker 3:          00:44:16       Uh, that appears to just be an urban legend. Are you kidding me? Idiot. Look again. Double check that I just went to snopes and they're, they're falsing it just flat out so that we fact check that I evidently, there's a reason you thought that though. Cause this is like a thing. Uh, but this is not true. I had never, why would people think that about her? That's so rare. Yeah. Homer. But is that a real thing then? Because now I'm questioning if that's even, yeah. What, what Ula was just describing. Absolutely is a thing. Sometimes it, you know, when a baby is born it's, it's sort of ambiguous and it's sort of, the doctor just kind of makes a call. Um, so that, that is very low.

Speaker 2:          00:45:05       What does it mean? A doctor just makes a call

Speaker 8:          00:45:09       literally that it can happen.

Speaker 2:          00:45:12       Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to understand this. The doctor makes a call. So is he doing something to the baby or is he just breading? Male or female and the birth certificate. The ladder. And so what if the baby has a penis and he's written down as female? I,

Speaker 3:          00:45:31       I mean, I don't know the specifics of it, but I do know that this is, I mean, obviously this is not super common.

Speaker 2:          00:45:37       Wait, I'm just really actually curious about the metal. Can you guys look into that period? No, I'm curious. Let's look into that. Um, we're so sidetracked, but I'm just fascinated by that. So baby can be born with like either and they cannot and the doctor can't tell the genitalia.

Speaker 8:          00:45:54       Intersexuality occurs whenever human being has both male and female physical, correct characteristics. Contrary to the main thing, they do not have two sets of genitals. They often have ambiguous genitals structures. Not readily identifiable was collectors or penis or, so it's somewhere in the middle.

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       Why? But that means that they have like a Ho like a vaginal, like they have a vagina, like an entrance and like a little penis to, does that mean they could actually fuck themselves?

Speaker 3:          00:46:28       No, no, no, no, no. I don't know. I don't know. I know, I know you're just curious, but yeah. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:46:35       I'm asking what people are thinking here. We're in pursuit of knowledge.

Speaker 8:          00:46:39       I just, I don't know. I'm still reading. I don't want to, I don't want to misrepresent this at all. But anyway.

Speaker 3:          00:46:46       Well, regardless of, uh, regardless, Jamie Lee, curtis, he's not, we have definitely cleared that one up so

Speaker 8:          00:46:55       damn by, it can be like, eh. Well, at any rate it says that you can go in and like people can go on a long periods of their lives without knowing that they were intersex

Speaker 2:          00:47:10       quiet and then they like grow out of it.

Speaker 3:          00:47:12       No, just I think just when you're a kid, I mean, you're not necessarily seeing other people. You don't know that you're different. I'm curious

Speaker 2:          00:47:19       to see what that looks like. Obviously I can't show that.

Speaker 8:          00:47:23       Yeah, no, but I am curious. But anyway, that is, why are you seeing pictures? No, I'm just trying to read about it. But that's why the gender issue is like, whoa. Even though regardless of

Speaker 2:          00:47:35       that, I, that's such a stupid, well, people have been making these arguments for so long. People have been saying it about homosexuality first they say, Oh, if two dudes can fuck each other or marry each other, then what? Then what can we start marrying animals? Yeah, that's, well, it's, it's just so weak. It's so lame. Like Adam, first of all, animals cannot consent. You know, people, people always ask me, can vegans, um, take a, can they, can you come? And the vegans mouth people are always asking you that. People always ask me that. No, I did get an email about that. Um, but I, I would say, yes, you can come and a Vegan smells and I'll tell you why. Because a human can consent to give you their semen and I assure you that it will be given with much pleasure if I, my experience is any indication of that. But animals cannot consent to give you there. Am I right Dan? Am I representing this rate? You're, you're a vegetarian.

Speaker 8:          00:48:35       Well yeah. Animals cannot consent to, um, allowing you to kill them or I guess you're talking more about like dairy or eggs or something like that. Uh, yes. Correct.

Speaker 2:          00:48:44       Right. So, so semen is Vegan if you have the consent of persons who you're sucking. Yeah. Right. So, um, did you send me a link? You want me to read this?

Speaker 8:          00:48:55       So back to that previous thing. Um, I just want to correct that. It could look like a male or female genitalia isn't look weird necessarily, but you are homeless. Could be,

Speaker 10:         00:49:10       Eh,

Speaker 8:          00:49:12       oh. Like you could have the other hormones. So sometimes that's the only during puberty. Interesting. You'll feel different than the gender that was given.

Speaker 2:          00:49:21       I'll show my screen, I'm looking up in her s intersects genitals. Damn. Okay man.

Speaker 8:          00:49:29       But they said that it happened actually a lot more than people realize. One in 100 people in the u s want. That's what I had heard too. I didn't want to say it just off the top of my head and be wrong. But yeah, it's um, it's much more common than

Speaker 2:          00:49:41       here's a picture of a, I've typed intersects genitals and here's a picture of Jamie Lee Curtis. I swear to God,

Speaker 8:          00:49:50       they're definitely appear. I guess that was an urban legend that existed because many articles came up about it when I googled it. So I don't know how I'd never heard that before. It's just,

Speaker 2:          00:50:01       I heard that like, as, as like a fact. False. False. Uh, let's see here.

Speaker 2:          00:50:12       Yes. Is She, she's a sheet. But regardless, I find that that argument very listen, homosexuals, transsexual, there are people, I just don't understand the whole, this whole campaign of like trying to why our, why, why are you even trying to contradict them? Just let them live their live like, you know what I mean? Yeah. I mean obviously some of them are pretty aggressive and annoying. Well, there's extremes in that. Exactly. You know, but if someone's just like, Hey, I'm transgender, I don't see that being an argument, you know? But again, if this guy is doing it as a protest, I think it's very, very, very weak because time is measured. My Dude, you have been on this earth for 69 years and unless I missed a memo, we do not have time travel yet. And so time as I know, no it is not yet in dispute. Sexuality however, is somewhat of an abstract concept. I know that there are male and female genitals, so there is that concreteness of biological sex. But I guess what the Trans people talk about is gender, which is, which is different and, and, and like we just said, I mean even the, even the biological aspect isn't it? I mean it definitely is a completely different beast. So if he is trying to do this to make a point, it's a, it's a pretty weak argument. So weak argument. And also,

Speaker 2:          00:51:52       I mean, dude, just, just fuck those old ladies to be like Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, the Cougar Champs got no problem, man. He gets and he takes it for all of us. He's a young man and you are trying to lie on tinder about your age so you can fuck some 49 year old, cute little cuties, young cuties. Hmm. It's fucked up, man. It's fucked up. It's just not right there. You have it. They should be podcast spreading knowledge. This is a wild story. So this American missionary who's trying to spread the word of God goes to a, uh, there's an island in a, in India that is blocked off from all hue of humanity. And this tribe has lived there in isolation for 55,000 years. Some people estimate and the Indian government protects this island because, well, first of all, I think there's something beautiful about, um, they don't want any, they don't wash.

Speaker 2:          00:52:55       Yeah. And, and I think there's something beautiful about conserving that and just letting them live in peace. There's been, people have attempted to go there and they've always reacted violently as, I guess I was reading an article that, um, the British, a British went to the island early during their colonial days and like decimated the population of the island. And since then, their original numbers have been decimated and now they're still just a small fraction of what the population was. And they're very guarded, justifiably from outsiders. And so this American missionary goes to India. Let me pull up this article. He writes that he's going there for tourism, but its real purpose is that he wants to spread the message of Jesus and he knows is going against the law. Preventing. Yes, Indiana. Go there. India prohibits, uh, prohibits visitors, um, and well, he was killed by the natives. Yeah. Let me read. Whoops. Um, let's see here. John is said to have died and a hail of arrows as he set foot on North Sentinel, sentinel island, part of the Indian controlled islands in the Bay of Bengal. People live there or one of the few tribes completely cut off from the rest of the world and have previously fired at outsiders. The media here is really incredible and these people are fascinating. Like here's someone off the coast, here's the, um,

Speaker 2:          00:54:36       the tribe. Yeah. Like when they see people off the coast, they stand guard on the beach. They're fucking cool. It's amazing what a trip. It's like really? Um, here's the island right here. So really beautiful little cuddle land. Um, this is incredible. 55,000 years they've been there. Um, Indian police confirm the death and said local electronic engineers. Simply, his name was Alexander. Uh, he had locals and five fishermen took him out to the island illegally.

Speaker 2:          00:55:20       Um, he hired fishing a guys to get close and he kayaked to the island from the boat. Here's some more footage of them. And this was like a known thing that they were hostile, prohibited by the Indian government. They're known hot. Well, the fishermen knew that too. And actually they're under arrest now. Oh Wow. Oh, right. Cause I mean, they broke the law, taking him there. He was attacked by arrows. But continued walking, but I'm not, the fisherman saw the tribals trying to rope. Oh my God. The fisherman saw the tribals tying a rope around his neck and dragging his body. They were scared and fled, but return next morning to find his body on the seashore fucking crazy. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:56:11       the people are banned from getting within three miles of the island. The island with an estimated population of between 40 and 200. Wow. That's not a lot family. They used to be thousands of them and said to be at risk of death if they have contact with outsiders because they have no immunity to common diseases like fluent measles. So this guy out there trying to give them God. Yeah. Trying to get my little tastes at Ge is us could actually end up, um, decimating them out the final, I mean, not a happy that guy died, but it's like, yeah, you're God. You got what? Well, you know, I mean the guy went looking for Jesus and he found him.

Speaker 7:          00:56:52       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:54       Yup. May have taken all, he may have taken the whole veggies. What he's like, Hey, he sees him in the afterlife is like, Hey, I saved you all.

Speaker 7:          00:57:02       We made it. We made it you guys.

Speaker 2:          00:57:09       On the evening of 14 November, the group of six pretending to be fishing evaded, the patrolling police coast guard and navy ships reaching the island at midnight before Mr Chu Kayak to the island in the morning, please said the fishermen agreed a time and place to meet each other near the island. On the morning of 17th November, they saw a dead person being buried at the shore, which from the silhouette of the body, clothing and circumstance appeared to be the body of John Allen Choo. This is an iconic photograph taken from a helicopter after the 2004 tsunami, which apparently a day somehow survive like this huge tsunami that this guy is shooting a bow and Arrow at a helicopter because they're just so unacquainted with the outside world. I can't imagine what they would think. What would you even think? Yeah, yeah. Be Terrifying. Some gnarly bird, rightly.

Speaker 7:          00:58:08       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:58:10       In a situation like this too. I mean, what, what was the plan? I mean, how are you going to, you can't just give them bibles, they don't speak English, obviously wanting to explore and Tati he could be the one guy that could reach to them. So the thing about these missionaries, they believe that it comes from a good place, even though it's insane as they think that the best thing you can do for another person is give them Christianity because they'll die. And internal torment trying to save. He's just trying to save their soul. Right? So to him, he's like, this is like, I'm going to save these guys from an from eternal torment. They never even got the word of Jesus Christ. So how are they supposed to get saved? And so he goes out there with the purest of intentions. But I mean, I will say for him at least he didn't fuck a kid. That's so bad joke. So there is some thing nice to say about him after all.

Speaker 7:          00:59:12       Mm.

Speaker 2:          00:59:15       Um, it's pretty wild story though going too. I mean he, he clearly, he knew what he was getting stuff into cause he hired a black, a black market, uh, illegal fishermen to write his ass there and Kayak. And of course, according to what I read, He, there was hails of arrows coming at him and he continued to walk with Bible in hand. It say that. Yeah, it's it. Do you want me to go back? I'll read that shit. I think it's, and we're in those, it's Santa. I'll read the hell out of that shit again.

Speaker 7:          00:59:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59:53       Mel Gibson could make a movie about this guy and in the movie the natives are Jews. Of course I'm here. It says, uh, he was attacked by Arrows but continued walking. The fishermen said it's pressing forward. Yeah, a little brave heart moment. Um, so there you have it pretty wild man. Z American. He's American. Yes. There you go. What do you think about that? I mean, it says John loved people and he loved Jesus. It was willing to give his life to share Jesus with the people in North Center. No island ever since high school. And John wanted to go to that island to share Jesus with indigenous people

Speaker 3:          01:01:02       or since high school. So it was like a longterm project for, yeah, I mean it's, again, I know that was kind of terrible state, but it's really hard to sympathize with this guy. It's like you knew, you knew exactly what you were getting yourself into. You know?

Speaker 2:          01:01:18       That's an interesting story. At what point it's like you can go to church and all that, but at what point, at what point does a religion become insane? Like you can believe in the person is insane, but his defining characteristic is that he loved the God and that his whole life was to go, it's a, it seems like a suicide then a little bit. Yeah. It was a martyr, right? It was a mood or you know, God loves martyrs, so

Speaker 3:          01:01:55       there you have it. Like you said though, I mean the point where it, it drips into, yeah, it's just fucked up, is that there is the high likelihood that you're going to affect all these people with measles or smallpox or something and wipe them out. It's like, that's a nice, you're kind of, you're kind of, yeah, you're kind of fucked up at that point. Well, he's like my only, I just wanted to get them a bible now if they all die,

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       it's okay right there saying, boy, I don't think so dude. They're all safe. No, I dug a little bit of arrogance little bit, but I feel bad for the guy. I wish them all the best in the afterlife. IOP is received well by God and that he says you did my work and you save those savages, you know? I mean, my God, they've got bows and arrows. They need bibles and we need to get them jobs so that they can pay their 15% tiff teeth. How do you say that when the tight tight, but we need to get those savages pink tight right now because you know that,

Speaker 4:          01:02:59       okay

Speaker 2:          01:03:01       God, don't run on faith. You run a money. All right, what's next?

Speaker 2:          01:03:07       Wow. We got a lot of, a lot of windows open, you know, speaking of stories that I don't know how to feel about it too. There was another one 95 year old Nazi deported to Germany and I found this so, such a fascinating story because I one hand, here's a shit head Nazi, which we all, hey, um, but he's like this 95 year old guy who's being deported to Germany. He's lived here for 70 years. He's 95 here is in the u s yeah, in the United States. 1949. Um, and Germany doesn't want them either. They're like, he's not a city. We don't fucking want this Nazi, but he's so old and frail. Uh, well let me watch the video.

Speaker 11:         01:03:55       Do you ever night up in New York man, officials are calling the last surviving Nazi great jacket. Like he's 94 year old. Can't handle like her. What the hell you could take out a, he could gas. Did you at any minute and so weird. 1949 hiding his past as an armed guard and don't think it was right. He was stripped of his citizenship years ago, but he remained here in the u s that is until now. [inaudible] Mary is here with a story. Tara, good morning. Good morning, Paula. Yeah, Paul. He has been living in the shadows for decades. Amat Authority say is the last known surviving Nazi collaborator on US soil until now, living in Queens, New York. His presence, they're bringing on year the outrage from the surrounding community, but this morning he's been deported to Germany at the direct order of president trump. ABC News was there exclusively as ice agents wield no. At 95

Speaker 2:          01:04:50       die like that's it. Get the Germany and what you can't gave him and get on a plane at 95 I mean that guy is going to not last long. Well, Jeremy doesn't know what to do with them either, but I guess the premise is that he's a Nazi and he doesn't even, the guy deserves no dignity or comfort or anything. Right. That's, I guess the premise they sent ice out there for Christ's sake to wrap them up and throw him in a airplane. Well here.

Speaker 11:         01:05:16       Oh, so you a Nazi.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       You're watching him is on the case. Five year old navy. Listen to Justin Bieber. Is there, do you have any comment? Do you have any comment on Ariana Grande's breakup with a Pete, Pete Davidson? Sir, are you a Nazi? Yes sir. Have you heard? Thank you. Next, do you have any comment sir? Jerry Seinfeld is, I'm one of the most rich Jews. Have you seen his standup? Are you fan of Jerry Seinfeld? Sir, can I get a, can I get a remark? You don't believe it looks like he's dead, sir. Sir. Are you fan of Seinfeld and Larry? David, have you seen Seinfeld the show, sir?

Speaker 7:          01:06:06       Love it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:09       I mean, it's obviously a theater. It's like a show cause nothing's really at stake here. It's just like a statement. It's a statement. It's a theatrical. It's fair. It's very much just for Shell.

Speaker 7:          01:06:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:06:24       But what do you learn later in the stories that he was just a guard. I don't know what his involvement was necessarily an n and the execution of, of people during the Holocaust. He was a guard at one of the death camps though, right? Yes, he was. And He, Oh yeah. Well here, this story continues to explain, but the real question is, um, what does he think about, uh, the full house remains

Speaker 10:         01:06:50       okay.

Speaker 11:         01:06:52       It's finally being deported for his alleged role as an armed guard is a Nazi death camp at the whole in decades after his alleged involvement. I never regret, sir. Do you have any regrets? Justice Department investigators?

Speaker 2:          01:07:06       Sure. Have you seen the movie

Speaker 10:         01:07:11       any regrets

Speaker 11:         01:07:17       that's complicit in the deaths of thousands of Jews during World War Two? Authority? Say Paul, he lied to immigration officials when he first entered the u s in 1949 and it wasn't until 2003 that he was exposed as an alleged war criminal and stripped of his US citizenship. Anything you'd like to say, sir? Anything delete investigators. Think right

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       sir? Have you seen frazier? Do you know that Fraser is run by Jews? Do you have any remark? This footage is so weird. Caring and willing. That one. Then this, I'm confused about the straight jacket situation. Yeah. This tray Jack. I see a clear and eminent threat, sir.

Speaker 11:         01:08:07       And in 2004,

Speaker 2:          01:08:08       what do you think about crusty being a juicer? Have you seen the Simpsons [inaudible] who was a Jew in the that yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:08:16       His Dad was a rabbi. I'm a deep, I got Simpson's Laura for days. Okay. During a single nightmarish day in November, 1943 all of the more than 6,000 prisoners of the Nazi camp that Yucky Pauli had garden. We're systematically butchered. A judge ordered him to port it in 2005 but no country would take him for years. Protestors gathered outside his home in Queens, demanding action. Members of Congress imploring president trump to finish what was started to send a message to the entire world that the United States stands firmly against antisemitism, bigotry, and hatred. The deportation drawing rare praise for trump from top democrats.

Speaker 12:         01:09:00       War Criminal. He didn't deserve to live in the United States. He doesn't deserve to die in the United States place of freedom. Mini quality where we respect each other's different

Speaker 11:         01:09:11       sources. Tell a B, c news. The president became fixated on the case ordering his new ambassador to Germany, Richard Grinnell to make polys and deportation a top priority. After being sworn in. It's unclear what's next for him. He's being detained by the German government, but they're still evaluating as legal status since they don't consider him to be a German citizen. So deported overnight future to be determined in Germany. Exactly. Hi everyone. George. Stephan,

Speaker 2:          01:09:37       how about that? Oh, it's a weird one. It's a weird one. I mean he's a Nazi shit bag, uh, clearly, but he's also 95 years old. You know? What would you do? Well, I mean, I don't know how to feel about it. I'm [inaudible], I'm ambivalent. I just don't see at this point what's the point of doing this? Yeah, they should just throw him in a hole. I'm in prison. Hmm. Sounds like you know, just the whole, it sounds like since it took this long for them to report him and Germany doesn't want him either. He basically is probably just going to spend the rest of his life in, in a camp. Kind of ironic. Yeah. That is kind of a beautiful thing. Let's put them in a camp. I'm okay with it. You go make them watch a b movie for all of eternity. Oh, fate was Jerry Seinfeld presents to the, yeah, but up everytime that speeds up every time it says be. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:10:39       Let's hop on over to fat submissions. Guys, if you have submissions for us, questions, videos, suggestions, anything at all, please drop us a line@podcastaththreehthreeproductions.com. Today we have an email from Ma Meechi guys, big fan of the show. Oh, this is, sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. You want to watch the CEO of Papa John. Now let's go to this fancy finishes. Yeah. Boy. Michi says, I think Honestly Ping in the sink is a superior method than using a urinal. Pros, you can save up to five liters of water because you don't have to flush. You can wash your hands while you're doing it. I don't understand. Don't, don't you finish pain before you wash your hands. Otherwise, what's the point? None of this makes sense. Why are you washing your hands while you're paying? That's you're not done with the act. The sink doesn't. Have you ever thought about, you haven't thought about this, but I washed my hands before Ip cause I don't want to get my dick dirty.

Speaker 2:          01:11:40       Right. Makes Sense. Because the Dick has kind of a holy, it's my temple. It's a uh, it's a quarantine down there. Uh, the sink doesn't really get dirty because you are cleaning it up while you're paying literally impossible to miss. So you don't have to worry about cleaning up or even putting toilet seat up. Splash it. Just something that I'm concerned about. It says not cleaning it up, but if you're paying in a sink, there's a little drops of urine all over the place. Standing Upright. Cons, you have to properly clean the sink once a week. That's disgusting Bro. Once a week, if somebody walks in on you, you are going to get kicked out of their house. Um, well I, I disagree with the premise of peeing in the sink, but I found a subreddit called sync pisters on know, which is singularly, there's a whole subculture.

Speaker 2:          01:12:36       Yeah. It's a whole community dedicated to the glory of paying in a sink and from the sidebar that says, don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. He was talking about pissing in the sink. One P is sterile. Two sinks are unsterile. Three people spit in the sink every day and occasionally vomit there. I don't pee and my friend seek, I don't pee in the kitchen sink. I run the water while Ip. Uh, I never shit in the sink. Well, that's a good, I don't pee in the sink when they're a year olds nearby. I don't pee in the tub unless I'm showering in it. If I noticed that NEP has missed the drain, I wipe it down. Well, I right off the bat, but the P is sterile thing.

Speaker 2:          01:13:33       I'm believe that's bullshit. I know that gets repeated on you. Look that up because I recently saw an article saying that p is not actually sterile. It's way PA's gross. Okay. These gross, we can all agree with that. Although I've seen some porns. Where do people don't think it's gross? I'm sure you can find everything is not stale. Stale or stare. It could be stale I suppose, but it's not sterile. I keep the water running after I finish peeing, peeing in the sink. Although more readily accomplished, my mail is not in any way limited to the mail. Sex. Now here's one of the posts that I looked at that really horrified me. Okay. Which goes against the tenants of peaks. If this goes against the tenants of sync peers, and this is the fourth highest rated post on the subreddit. So God a different kind of mile high club. That dude is peeing in the sink and an airplane toilet right there. This has gotta be ironic. Well, this is people for real. I think it is for real. Should, um, although it's hard to say it because the post under it says heavy breathing and it's a picture of a sink. Slash. Gear. We were gang owned and see that one. Yeah. Imagine pissing in the sink. Piss her master race. What is this?

Speaker 2:          01:15:02       Imagine paying, but you have to flush it. This meme was made by Cinque p gang. All right, well there you have it. So I, I think you should use a toilet, dude. If you're asking me, I think he should use the toilet. You know, you may enjoy it and I'm, I've peed in a sink before. I'm not going to lie. Okay. I've done it, but I don't, I've not made that one. I think it was possibly that the which sink. I think it must have been first when I was a kid, just out of curiosity. And then another time probably, I don't remember if it was with you, Elo or different girlfriend, but we were both in the bathroom at a time and she was on the toilet and I peed in the sink.

Speaker 2:          01:15:45       It may have been with you. You remember something like that? Yeah, I think it was you. It was a long fucking time ago. That must've been like so long ago now. Boy. Like super drunk. Yeah. I think we were drunk. I think it was like an art gallery and we were drinking wine or some shit. But regardless. No, it wasn't at home. No, we were drunk right off. But the point is that yes, we weren't thinking right. It's not like something we would do. No. And I was, I cleaned up. I didn't splash, but I also, I'm just saying a splash could happen. Splash does happen. And all I'm saying is that why of it too. At brush next to the sink. There was no toothbrushes next to the sink and Bob, this guy. Oh yeah, no. Well, you know, they say that there's poop particles found on most toothbrushing or you said, I'm telling you, look it up. Damn. We're fact checking who particles found on most toothbrushes.

Speaker 2:          01:16:47       But I think that life is complicated enough. You don't need to be paying and sinks looking over your shoulder. Try explaining that to a, you know, a new date or a family member or God forbid anyone. I mean the, uh, the poop thing is verified and can looks like. Thank you. Who doesn't know their shit? Now you, me an excerpt, Dan. Well, it says I'm your toothbrush is home to plaque, blood and even fecal matter. Yes. You're probably scrubbing poop particles all over your pearly whites. There was a study in 2012 this, this sink piss. There's listening are like, so that's the problem with is again the sinker, right? I say don't pee in the sink for Christ's sake, man. Get your shit together. Chris Donahue, what up h three fairly popular men style video, uh, made a video about youtubers with Wac hairstyles and to no surprise. Thank you. Ethan was one of the people he talked about. Here we go buckle up. I'm ready to get pissed off.

Speaker 13:         01:17:55       And last but certainly not least, the fourth tip or the tear,

Speaker 2:          01:18:01       I mean that with love, but he looks like an Elf. Ears are a little pointed. It's true. It's like the hair, everything he's got going on. He's very happy. He's very elf. Handsome health chic style. It's the AIRINC still. He's a little bit of a swashbuckler. Okay. You know, pirates wore gold earrings to pay for their funeral. Is that real? Dan? Can we fact check that I'm on it. Linkedin has an all the fire. It's a war gold earrings so that if they died in combat, they, Erin could be used to pay for their funeral. Is that fascinate you? I did not hear that. Well, I'm a wealth of knowledge and Dan is fact checking me as we speak meanwhile,

Speaker 13:         01:18:45       but could be so much better is Mr. Ethan Klein. Ethan has incredibly thick, coarse curly hair. He's gone short. He's gone long. He's gone. Throw another one of those you'd Zippers that I absolutely love and it definitely you're hitting needed more tlc then he's coming. Or Hot Dude like lists.

Speaker 2:          01:19:07       Who wouldn't fuck the shell? Legless the blonde. Yeah. Isla you fucked the show. Like list. Yeah, you would. You know who legless is dating Katy Perry. Really? Wow. It's getting some fucking premium. That's what I meant by Elf now that I found out you liked my content

Speaker 13:         01:19:29       giving it. Now the incredible thing about Ethan and his hair is so crazy because it's crazy curly. One of the problems with thick coarse currently

Speaker 2:          01:19:37       bomb hairstylist. I would totally hire him to be my hairstylist

Speaker 13:         01:19:42       hair is that if you don't understand it, if you don't nurture it and love it and get a hairstyle is that understands how to cut it and it can be a disaster, but it could be better like this with the right product. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:19:55       What's happening here? What happened here, Dan

Speaker 13:         01:19:58       am I asked him, Oh fuck, but certainly not least the fourth popular. You could be better like this with the right problem.

Speaker 2:          01:20:06       When you that Dan,

Speaker 7:          01:20:09       what does it, what the fuck is that shot? It's just the screen got super small. Can you help me out here? I think so, but how could he missed that? What the hell? Youtube helped me out. That could be better like this with the right there. What is this? Are you seeing Miss Dan? Yup. I'm seeing it. Is it not just baked into his video and he just fucked up. I mean it's just so strange but okay. Product, the right kind of, that guy's got some hair. You think I can pull that look off field?

Speaker 2:          01:20:41       I think you could buy your winner and take some work. That guy's got like wax in his hair. You know what I mean? I do. I draw the line at wax, but that's hot hair. I mean, that hair's fucking, maybe it's just they rocket. I think it's just that he's very attractive and it looks like, it looks like someone just here will look good on that guy. That guy could have like pubic hair and looked pretty good. I want to fuck this guy's what I'm saying? This hair. Come on dog. There's no way in hell I'm selling my hair like that. I mean, I'm not knowing that he's got a fade in like a little pompadour curl. I mean, dude, imagine a Chubby guy like me who dresses in like elastic waist shorts, walking out their haircut like that

Speaker 13:         01:21:33       curly, luscious locks of amazingness. Come on,

Speaker 2:          01:21:36       dude. I am. There's no way I'm styling my hair like that. What do you think? You know, you like my hair the way it is. Yeah. I like it longer. Peewee Herman. Yeah, girl, let's go jerk off in a movie theater

Speaker 13:         01:21:57       like this. You think I should go see a stylist who understands curly hair? He might need some type of relaxer or Keratin treatment. Just to take a little bit of the curl out of the hair. It's going to relax the curl a little bit more in terms of product. He could probably get away with the Pete and Pedro Cream, which is a leave in conditioner or the beat and Pedro paste that he's looking for a little bit more. Pedro. Sure. This guy's, this guy's

Speaker 2:          01:22:20       pedro money. Oh Wow. He calls it the question. Everything he says he's brand new. He's in their pocket. You think it's his

Speaker 13:         01:22:30       right and a little bit of shine. Gentlemen, if you are not sure what

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       well there you have it. Um, I think you should go for it man. Well, I'm going to have to wait like a year before all your hair. Yeah, that's true. As long again, but when that happens, I'm going to ask. Yeah, boy. For some Pete and Pedro, whenever it was he selling. This one comes from James. Hi, my name is James. I'm from the UK and a level 10 vapor. Dan will know what I mean. Am I little bit sick? That's a high, that's a high level. Is that good? Oh yeah. And my local shop, I found what I swear is a budget hunk version of Ethan. Maybe it's just me. Let's see.

Speaker 7:          01:23:18       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:23:19       it's a vape juice.

Speaker 2:          01:23:22       There it is. Yeah. Oh definitely. I was like, wait, what happened over here? He continues. Just thought you should know. It kind of tastes like shit. There was a lemon and lime flavor available. Tilt. Keep doing what you're doing and congrats on the baby. It definitely looks like a budget. It looks like animate and so me. Well you know what, if you're going to use my likeness for vape flavor, at least make a nice one, you know? Yeah. That's bogus that it's a terrible flavor. I wonder what it sells for on Black Friday.
