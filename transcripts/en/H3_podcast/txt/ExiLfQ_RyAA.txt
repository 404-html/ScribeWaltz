So I hope you enjoy that. Check it out. Please enjoy it today. We've got a lot to get to. I've got a new mic. How do I sound on the Saturday today we've got the Shane a jake documentary.

Speaker 2:          00:01:07       I want to talk a little bit about that. Bill cosby has started a new sitcom and which he goes to prison, which is a really, really looking forward to that. It's on NBC, premieres this a fall at a pm. Looking forward to bill cosby goes to prison. We've also got drake and millie. Bobby Brown had been raising eyebrows with their salacious. I feel like that's over the top interesting relationship and much, much more. Oh, welcome everybody. To the age three. Buck gas myriad's. Alright, thanks for coming everyone. We really, we got the best. We got the best stuff here to talk about. So from the top, Shane and jake. Shane Dawson is the king of Youtube. Yeah. These past couple of these were kind of the king of Youtube for like a past year or something, but these whole documentary series have just been over the, over the top like um, can you pull up his channel?

Speaker 2:          00:02:12       I want to show you the views that he's got there, but right now he has just come out with a Jake Paul documentary called inside the mind of Jake Paul when he tries to understand really what's going on with that guy. And I'm intrigued. Let's see. Let's see here. I'm looking at look at all of his recent views. What does that look? So low quality, is that just part of the thing? 16 million. Fourteen million. 18, $24 million. I mean this is just. This is average stuff. Yeah. This is insane. This is like new level shit. So anyway, his new documentary about Jake pauls out. Look at this. I loved this. Um, Jake's response to part one was number two,

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       trending with two point 2 million views in two days and Shane's video with 10 million views in one day wasn't on trending. I don't remember a damn. What the hell? What's the logic? How do you trend Jake Paul's response video? I don't know. I can, they just fix the trending page and it's like it's just not a trending page. And if it is curated, why did they keep trending? Jake Paul, if there's really no good explanation for why this would be there and not that one, it literally is counter intuitive. That response isn't what's trending, it's the topic itself, it's just, it's maddening. But regardless. So that's mine. The crunch of it is that he's trying to see if Jake Paul's a sociopath and I personally don't think that Jake Paul's a sociopath. I mean that's a tall claim, but then it takes this twist where he's like, well maybe he's a brother.

Speaker 3:          00:04:04       Logan is the sociopath and it's about him living in the shadow of his brother, which is a really interesting twist and I definitely can see that. I could see that. Yeah, I can see that for sure. So I am looking forward to seeing how this series unveils. But there was, by the way, I think Logan was blindsided by the whole thing because jake and his video was like, I knew it was about sociopathy and he's like, I'm not a sociopath so come make this documentary about me. He's like, he's going to be good pr for me. Shit. So Logan I think was blindsided that he was all the sudden coming under the magnifying lens and he just tweeted out this morning, this I really didn't want to, but I feel compelled to give my thoughts on Shane series this far. And then Shane actually responded a surprise extended finale.

Speaker 3:          00:04:52       Which is a shame. Really. Don't give a fuck he's ready. But anyway, the really intriguing thing for me and I am, I am, I'm intrigued. You know, I'm, I'm glued to the set here affect Shane has given a lot of youtubers hope, kind of always channel and just turn the second round. Well for a long time he was a guy that just taste tested fast food. Yeah. For so long. I don't know what he was doing before that. Those probably. He did like sketches and she said, I don't know. He's not. He has two channels. He's been kind of like, been around forever and doing all kinds of different content, but he was just eating food for a long time, but he likes this lugged through it, found his voice and he really has got this second wind that's unbelievable. It's really cool. I really liked the style of the document date.

Speaker 3:          00:05:46       If it's fresh, it's really well edited. I Dunno who's editing that. I'm sure Shane is probably sitting there a lot with the editor, but the editing. Absolutely bananas. Um, he wears the same shirt in every video I don't think. Well, I don't know if it's the same shirt, but either that or he's like doug funny and he's got like, you know, you've ever done, you know, he dug high net worth doing the same outfit every day and, but then there's an episode where he walks in the closet and he just has like the same outfit. He wears the same shirt. God bless his soul. Um, yeah, no, but hey. But there was one moment here that really broke my heart. There was a moment in the new episode that really broke my heart as a fan, as a call. I want to say colleague, but maybe an associate you could say as someone who's had him here, a guest on our podcast, it really broke my heart. So here it is really going to talk about this.

Speaker 4:          00:06:50       I do also remember like Jake Paul was on it.

Speaker 3:          00:06:53       See if you notice anything here, kind of missed the timestamp for Chrissake. See if you notice anything here. Okay. As he was talking about this, okay, listen closely, my friends. You're all going to really. This is really upsetting,

Speaker 4:          00:07:06       but I do also remember like j Dot Paul was on a podcast and he was about to hit 10 million subscribers

Speaker 3:          00:07:12       cast on a podcast. Damn, now we're spending Shane, my art.

Speaker 4:          00:07:26       Shane, you break in my heart on what podcast cast

Speaker 3:          00:07:30       on a podcast. Shane, my family isn't. My Godfather.

Speaker 4:          00:07:37       Pressure was on her podcast. What family? You come in my house. You sit across the table from me, but I get no respect to disrespect. You come. I'm a podcast on a podcast, the podcast where you have a podcast in my mind. It sounds like a perfect Italian godfather. Impression spot on Shane. Shane, you break in. My house is half Russian shade. He'll break. Break up. My aunt gave. Paul was honored

Speaker 3:          00:08:29       on a podcast. Anyway, God bless them. I'm not upset. I just thought it was funny. I just thought it was a funny opportunity to do my well traveled, well seasoned that Godfather but not one in the pocket for a while here at the office. Yeah, I'm working on that. My godfather accent for a long time. So did you change your mind? But Jake, Paul or thing would know, I never thought I, I kind of always suspected that jake deep down isn't a bad guy. I, I had that impression when I sat here with him, I thought, you know, because I had a conversation with him outside off camera and I was like, do tell me straight. We were walking to the bathroom together and I was like, and this was during their heyday when they were really competitive. I was like telling you how are you guys?

Speaker 3:          00:09:25       Because it seems really toxic. And he's. And he said, honestly, it's really bad. We honestly really hate each other. He told me that in complete earnestness off camera and the hallway. He's like, it's really bad. Honestly. You can tell that the competitive it's mentalities real well. Apparently Logan actually really fucked. Did Jake's ex girlfriend like for real? And then made like a distrac about it. But Jack was like, dude, like, like, act like I know that's like good for views, but that actually really hurts my feelings. You know, like these guys are fucking twisted. But apparently jake actually gets into a lot of this stuff. So I'm looking forward to that, but uh, if you can help me with that music one more time. Shane. I, I, what I bring on,

Speaker 4:          00:10:17       we talk, we sit across the tip. Do I do to deserve this disrespect jazz. This is getting better shit to disrespect. I bring him here. You sit across the table from me with that. We have a good time. What do I do with it? Has Given me the crickets.

Speaker 3:          00:10:43       I should have. Yeah, you fucked up. Moving on. Bill cosby. There's a new sitcom coming out on NBC, which is a really ballsy play out their part. Bill cosby goes to prison for sexual assault. I was like, wow, that's really edgy idea. Um, wait. Hold on. It's not a sitcom in handcuffs. After getting over three years in prison for 2000 for rape. Wait, I thought. Oh Man. I thought it was just a sitcom. What? Welcome to Papa's house. Welcome to Papa's house. Aka Prison. The clink. Isn't that crazy? It's the same with handcuffs. Dude. It is the weirdest timeline. Can we just reflect on the fact that 81 year old bill cosby worth $400, million dollars, America's most beloved entertainer, Jello in coke, sip and bill cosby is going, not just America. I was like, interest

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       is going to prison at 81 years old for rape. Fuck, that's the weirdest timeline imaginable. Oh my God. He was convicted in April of drugging and sexually assaulting Andre Constand, who testified that cosby violated her at is Pennsylvania home in 2004 after she came to him for career advice shoe. He was sentenced to three to 10 years for sexual assault. He has to register as a sex offender. He's classified as a sexually violent Predator online and they need to inform all their neighbors that have sexually violent Predator lives in the area that's a lifetime registration. Although I don't think his life is going to be much longer. 80 one in prison. He's in general population to a lot of people were like, oh, he's going to get preferential treatment. Listen to this.

Speaker 5:          00:12:59       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:13:01       he's in general population and he's so famous. You know what they're doing because when he talks to his wife and prison, they have speaker phones and like everyone around can hear, oh yeah, it's all monitored because it's a fucking prison. You know what I mean? They always end. The move is so everyone can hear you're near or if you're the police, if you're working there, you're listening to what they're talking about. And so people are paying.

Speaker 2:          00:13:28       They want to know everything he's talking about with his wife. He saw all these tabloids are our publishing, everything he's talking about with his wife. They can do that. Well, that's how they found out. But I mean pro, no, I'm sure it's probably illegal, but people are getting paid. Um, here, some of the anecdotes that came out of those phone conversations, I'm in a phone call with his wife Cosby recounted that a hot dog bun was thrown at his face, a cosby who was legally blind city fell down a flight of stairs because he wasn't being guided and was without his cane, which was apparently taken away along with his shoe laces by correctional officers over fears that he might harm himself. Cosby told his wife, grabbed the check book and hire anyone and everyone who could get him out as soon as possible. This mother fucker's worth $400, million bucks. And that money can not save him. This article says he said it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:34       No, the officials think he'll harm himself. I mean, cosby tells wife officials. Oh, he, he told his wife though, officials think all harm myself because they took away his cane and his shoelaces, as I understand is normal, but God damn. Can you imagine you're just like in prison and you're like, oh, it's bill cosby know. Hey Bill. Oh, and here's another great one. His first meal and prison. The NYLA pudding. Yeah, but the bunny at the. You put the hot dog, the face of the podium to the mouth. Really showing off your impressions to that is the impression and experience the age and experience. But Shit, you know, how could he do this? You put the Putty, you came here, I gave you politic and you said a podcast. How am I doing over impression? I'll animate crossovers right there. Um, so I think it's so pathetic. God. Bill cosby in prison at 81. So weird people will throw in a hot dog buns at his face like, like that's maybe the biggest fall from grace of all time. Like Shakespeare, the Greek mythology have stories of from king to peasant. I mean, this is a literal story of being bill Cosby, beloved, powerful,

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       rich, beyond imagination to inmates throwing hot dog, stale hot dog buns at your face. Well, the guy was a fucking prolific predator. The stories of what that guy

Speaker 2:          00:16:33       did was really remarkable. I mean, really astounding stuff. Actually have some clips. Um, this one is really incredible. It's a clip of from his old show, the cosby show, beloved, by all where he talks about he's doing a barbecue and he's like. And his wife was like, isn't it so nice how everyone's getting along after they were fighting? And he goes, hey, it's, it's the secret is my barbecue sauce. She's like, oh, you're kidding. He's like, oh, I'm dead serious. And he doesn't smile. His face is like dead pan. He's sinister sounding. And he continues. He goes, oh no, I'm dead serious. You ever notice when you have my barbecue sauce that everyone gets happier and gets a little too fondly? I'm dead serious and, and he continues and she goes, stop it and, and, and you almost feel like she's being creeped out, but I believe this. She's like, stop it. And he's like, no, I'm serious. I've got the clip. I'd like to show you. Yeah, let's watch it. Um, and then at the end of the clip, the kids are eating the barbecue and he comes and takes it away from them real fast. Implying that it is not a joke.

Speaker 2:          00:17:49       And so here, let me, let me. I mean, this shit is unbelievable. It really is truly something baby. A bill cosby, special bbq sauce. I wonder if he was. This is definitely anecdotal from his real life outside the show.

Speaker 6:          00:18:09       Watch his face. Work things out for themselves. It's my barbecue sauce. Barbecue sauce. Barbecue sauce. Haven't you ever noticed after my barbecue sauce? After awhile when it kicks in, they get all huggy bugging. I'm dead serious. Haven't one of my people want to get right home. Let me do something else. I got a cup of it up on the night table.

Speaker 5:          00:18:47       Correct.

Speaker 6:          00:18:51       I got a cup of it, said breathing. Somebody talks to his victims. Chicken to these people are going up and absence is threatening her. So here's the rest of the chicken chicken.

Speaker 2:          00:19:29       Wow. How is that like family content? You know, I think it was just like wacky at the actual context. Well, even the context at the time is that he's put a drug and the bar, I mean there's no other way to. They haven't worked anything out for themselves. That's all on my barbecue sauce. You seen. Oh, stop it. Stop anything. In fact, I got a big bucket of barbecue sauce in the room. Are you coming up or do I have to force? You know. And so somebody, of course I'm some genius. Um, his name is, uh, you God made an edit that I like to share with you guys. That really captures the moment more accurately I would say. Let's see.

Speaker 5:          00:20:27       Yeah, it

Speaker 6:          00:20:29       certainly is nice to see them work things out for themselves. Take up the left track for themselves. When it kicks in, they get all her buggy hockey. Pocky stops, right?

Speaker 2:          00:21:07       It's a threat. What can we look at his body language? I got a cup of chicken before. If this was a scene from like a horror chicken, he's like a serial killer or something. I wouldn't be surprised if they played this in court during this trial. We got a sound bite. The lawyer said like, you know in every joke there's a little bit of truth. Right? Exactly. Yeah. I think that's a good legal argument. We got a sound bite. Some of these barbecue sauce clips. I feel like these have a perpetual use. I love this barbecue sauce. I'm telling you. That was. That was courtesy of a eat. God actually. You know what? I don't know how long the store's been been in the news, but this is eight years old. Sorry, I'm literally dyslexic out dyslexia it out three years old. I actually, you know what I did? I cut the eight and half in my mind. [inaudible] it's three. Half of eight. Like literally if you cut it in half, you see it three. So you completed that. I completed the three in my mind. I know it's a really incredible stuff. Is it not? Not. I'm going to say this to you whenever I want to get it on and now you're not. Be like the barbecues outside. Why don't we go on upstairs? Somebody's either got the bomb. Mccune saw sand,

Speaker 2:          00:23:01       two new meaning of lube it up. When do I have here? Either you want to go. So all the songs you sing found a little sleeping, a little, uh, unconscious. A little, uh, Amnesia and so on. The sauce play some creepy music guys. But it's all on the sauce. You've seen either you feeling a little sleepy, a little amnesia, you know, lay down, close your eyes for get it all happen. You're kidding, right? Oh No. Tom, the sauce. I guess we have no creepy music.

Speaker 5:          00:23:39       Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:23:42       I feel like the moments gone enough.

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       I'm on the sauce. Wow. Welcome to Papa's house. Oh, that's a man that knows how to saw some pie on the sauce for him too. Now let's all give praise, by the way, to Hannibal burress, who, who by the way, let's all remember the Hannibal. Did this explosive standups several years ago, somebody just filmed it on their phone, everything, right? It wasn't on comedy central or anything. He was just at a nightclub and somebody filmed it on the phone and put it online and it made headlines because bill [inaudible] Hannibal was like, Fuck Bill. Cause we always tell them black people what to do from like a, from like a pet is still always being like black, black people need to bootstrap themselves up like me. He's like, he's a fucking rapist. That was the first time I never heard that. I didn't know that. He was like, seriously go google bill cosby raped and see what you find. And that was the catalyst that started this whole thing here. Let's watch that clip. So start me to probably, I think, I mean that was really a prolific. Not Prolific, but it was a monumental. It may have. Yeah, animal God damn

Speaker 7:          00:25:20       it was great but built stage crazy that he broke down and a great job too. But it was shocking at the time. Well that's a ballsy claim to make about it.

Speaker 3:          00:25:47       Anyone publicly to be like, Oh yeah, but you rape people. It's like, what? I can't really say that. Wow, that's great.

Speaker 7:          00:25:57       Credible stamats, puddling teflon image. Middle States. When people, they rape allegations, call me captain, kick him out. That shit is upset. If you didn't know about it, trust me. You leave in Google, Bill Cosby, right? Right. Okay. Stand

Speaker 3:          00:26:42       up. And um, yeah, that's really incredible stuff. So shout out to the animal. Got Goddamn. Well, let's throw it to a break.

We have to teddy fresh employees that are, and they're really having a great thing and I mean this, I love this and I love the new logo. We worked really hard kind of trying to concepts of new logos. We want to like, have like a strong branding element that wasn't a teddy bear. Yeah. Amazing. I want it to not always have to use the teddy bear and have somebody more graphic like the, the. Yeah, you've got to. It's like you got it. But that I don't know, just is a home run and I love how the um, the Hoodie has like the inverted colors. Like the inlay is different color. So. Cool. You're also wearing our shorts. Oh yeah. Eat. And in the uh, it's enough stuff. Drake, 31 years old, hip hop, mega superstar, drake, millie, Bobby Brown and 11 remotely famous 11 from stranger things. Uh, 14 years old. Um, it turns out that they are, I don't know, relate not their friends. And I find it interesting not only you have everyone on the Internet. Yeah. Well, and for good reason I think because I find it now, first of all, now spot speaking as a 33 year old band. I'm close to drake and age. How old is he?

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       Okay. Now what purpose? What value would you get out of texting? A 14 year old girl. I'm not really sure how much. I'm not really sure. I can't say, but then when she goes on to describe their relationship, I not only raised one eyebrow, raised both my eyebrows.

Speaker 9:          00:35:59       At first I heard about it because I think he invited her to a show and there was like a picture of them together and it was all cool. It was clear that he is a funnel for which who is not cool. Like she seems like such a bad as on the show. Yes. And she was a fan of him so all good. But then now it's like,

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       well she did these interviews or she's getting into details of like we taxed and we talk and he says that I missed you so much and I tell him I miss him and I imagined him, him, him at home being like, no, shut up. Know. Um, and there's another one where she's like, so I met him at a hotel and then we went out for dinner and then we're hanging out every night for three days and now we text each other all the time and we love each other and I'm just like whoa.

Speaker 9:          00:36:49       And is giving her advice on like boys and dating? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:36:53       And he's just got to be at home being like, God. All I'm saying is drake, be careful because Papa's house is not. We don't need another. We didn't want them to Papa's house. Barber's house. Don't need another inmate that here. Let's watch some of these videos. This is the first video that came out of her talking about him. Let me throw this up. This is a little excerpt of the video for you.

Speaker 10:         00:37:25       Gosh, he's not my crush. Okay, let me get this straight. He's like a brother. His brother. I met drake in an Australian hotel. I was touring and he was touring to and he honestly, his managers, this came up to my dad and said try it gloves the show come to a show tonight. And I was like, oh my goodness. My dad honestly it was on t mobile, the French team mobile trying to get as Wifi from Australia. He was like, I don't know who drake is, was like, are you joking me? Drink Shit. He wants to see me. I was like, okay, we're going. So I like got my outfit prepared at, went there and he was such a fan boy and it was such a fan girl that we honestly, we text all the time now. He helps me with everything, like just life lessons. Um, he's amazing. He's a great human being. And we went to dinner afterwards and we had dinner the next day and then we met in Sydney hotline bling is one of my favorites.

Speaker 2:          00:38:22       The part where she goes, we met for dinner and then we kept meeting for dinner next thing all the time. Texting all the time. I mean, again,

Speaker 9:          00:38:33       it's just, I feel like from perspective, I

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       see why she doesn't think it's a 14 year old girl. Yeah. And she thinks she's an adult, like you know, at that age you're like, I'm an adult at 14. Yeah. And she definitely has that air. She's a sweet girl. She's amazing. But you can tell she thinks she's

Speaker 9:          00:38:52       very mature. Fourteen year old too. But being 30 years old, being 31. And from our perspective it looks really weird. Os being closer in age.

Speaker 3:          00:39:07       Do you love me? Are you writing? Do you have a cell next to cars? Be You love me?

Speaker 2:          00:39:18       Yeah. And so anyway, that's part one. Okay, that's fine. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:39:26       Kiki, are you 14? Do you love me? Do you have a prison cell next to cars be? Um, so that's part one. Welcome to Papa's house. Here's part two. This one just, I guess came out about your relationship with drake. Tell me about that.

Speaker 2:          00:39:47       People have such as these a red carpet fucking interviews. Yeah. They like don't bat an eye and they're like, oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:39:56       Tell me about your relationship with drake.

Speaker 5:          00:40:01       What about your religion?

Speaker 10:         00:40:04       Drank. I think you want to tell me about your friendship. How did this all come about? I love him. I met him in Australia and he's honestly so fantastic and a great friend and a great, a great role model. You know, we text, we just text each other the other day and he was like, I miss you so much. It was like, I miss you more. He's coming.

Speaker 3:          00:40:21       He's like, Oh, don't fucking say that guy's shows how innocent and immature she is firsthand. You, you cannot. As a 31 year old man text a 14 year old girl that's not related to you. I miss you so much. [inaudible] cannot. And the fact that she doesn't understand that so little that even to her saying that doesn't look weird.

Speaker 2:          00:40:46       Um,

Speaker 9:          00:40:46       no she hasn't. She, I think she even made like a statement about it really just like a, you guys can't tell me who can be my friend. Just stopped making it awkward. Okay. But that's why I'm saying I don't think she can understand at her age how weird it is. No,

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       no. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. I feel, you know. Yeah. What can I say?

Speaker 3:          00:41:12       A lot of people say he's grooming her. That's just such a weird state. I don't know the term. What is grown. Basically what it means is that like he's preparing her or when she turns 18 so that he can legally hit it.

Speaker 2:          00:41:27       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:41:30       Apparently he four years of dedication. Yeah. Allegedly

Speaker 2:          00:41:35       he's done that with a, some kind of 16 year old girl. Ian Was Ian's the keeper of culture and knowledge, but I don't want to get the facts mixed up. But allegedly, and this is from a second hand report, but there was some sticks. 16 girl he met when she was 16 and when she turned 18 they started dating. Really? Yeah. Allegedly and I may maybe false. So again, take everything I say here as pure fact and not speculate them. Kiki, are you riding? Are you 14? Welcome to Papa's house. The other wrinkle in of this is like people are saying, um, he's just helping her out because he was a child star to. Right. Okay. You know what I mean? That's sweet. That's a sweet angle here. You want to see what she. Yeah. What'd she say? Why do I say, Oh, you gotta close your window. Let me finish this. Let me see what.

Speaker 10:         00:42:34       I'm definitely gonna. Go and see him. I'm so excited. Yeah. And Drake. That's awesome. That's awesome. What advice does he give you? Like what does he say about boys? He helps me

Speaker 2:          00:42:45       and then it's like, why does it always gotta go there? Like, damn, we talk about other shit. What are you going to go there? We always talk about boy.

Speaker 10:         00:42:54       Yeah, he's great. He's wonderful. I love the advice with boys, you know, that stays in the text messages.

Speaker 2:          00:43:01       Alright. So what else we got here? So she said, why you got to make a lovely friendship. Your headline, you guys are weird. For Real. I'm lucky to have people in business expand. Yeah. She, I mean again, like you said, she just, she, yeah, like you said you.

Speaker 5:          00:43:22       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:43:25       But the child star angle is a, is a valid defense, you know, and I'm not accusing the guy have anything. It's just a lot. But you know, but it's hard to explain that. Him texting her, I miss you very much. Yeah. She's like, and he initiated it. She was like, he texted me out of the blue. I miss you very much. And I was like, I miss you too. [inaudible]. I was just reciprocating. Kiki, are you 14? Are you riding? Get some quaaludes in that Jello when. Let's get barbecue sauce. Head on upstairs. All right, well, there you have it. Drake and millie. Bobby Brown. Next up, we've got stories for days, folks. This is the h three podcast experience. We've got stories for days. We've got the best stories people. This is my trump impression. Now we've got the best stories. People the best. Okay. You come here once you do a trump impression. This show is gone. I'm

Speaker 3:          00:44:31       not criticizing, I'm just doing an impression. Listen, we've got the best stores. People. I got the hand motion, right? We've got the. Believe me, we've got the best stores. Believe me, doing a trump impression is like so many bad ones, unlike mine, the handmade. It's a really fun impression because of all this. Just show as really gone downhill. Yeah. Well along with everything else, so I'm fucking right there. Believe, believe me, they actually podcast. Believe me, the HCD podcast. It's the best. Okay. Got The best stories. The best people take her from me. I would know. Trust me. It's the best. Was that good? I mean, obviously the voice Jimmy Fallon's, cold bear has by far the worst. I cannot stand coal bears trump impression mostly because he thinks it's so good and he talks so slow. It's like, oh my God. It's like dude, like talks like this is his intros are good, but then the impressions that were so.

Speaker 3:          00:45:46       It just slows the show down. He could. I was like this, ah, at, believe me, this show is that bass? I don't know. That's actually the best impression you've done so far. Have Cole bear doing trump really solid. Thank you Dan. Hey, there you go. I got something up my sleeve. I just need like three layers of separation from the source oppression and then it's good. Anyway. Well let's get the fuck on with it. Papa John. Is it the house and an effort to distance themselves? Do it. By the way, Papa John's the company is unlike a mutiny. I've been watching the show, the profit. So the pro here, this is gonna make sense in the follow up with me because the profit is this guy a marcus lemonis and he's like this business guru and what he does is he goes and invests in company and helps them become profitable.

Speaker 3:          00:46:41       He sees the potential in them, but the business owners are really. They're just fucking dumb. Like Nathan for you in real reality. Right? And the problem is usually the companies have an interesting product or an interesting market share or something like that that he can work with, but the owner is always just like, just so fucking stupid. Like it's really a lot of common sense stuff. He's like, all right, so you guys, I see you profitted half a million dollars last year, but somehow you still lost $300,000 in debt and the owner's like, yeah, well I bought a $300,000 truck to help promote them or something like that. And that's a real one. Yeah. Are there like a. he's got this big trucks thing outside of their office. He's like, well it's a half a million truck. I've got a big discount on that. Marcus is like, you gotta sell the truck though. Well I did sign up for that breakdown for that or it's always like a, Oh man. It's always like, this is a really common one. He goes and talks to all the employees and they're all amazing and super hard working and they're like, yeah, he's never here. He just ever comes here. The owner, he just never comes here. He's not involved at all. Oh. He's like, okay, so I need you to come to work five times a week. Oh, I did. Well I did sign up for that. Okay. It's always the same dumb shit.

Speaker 3:          00:48:07       So a funny show. Well anyway, my favorite episodes is when it becomes a full on mutiny and it's so juicy, so he comes in at the request of the owner and the owner is such a buffoon. He's so incompetent that he makes a pact with the employees and they all turned against the owner who called him and asked him and then he gets all defensive because often he'll give equity to the employees and then it's like. And then they're always like, fuck you, you're not my boss anymore. Suck my Dick. I hate you. They actually have conversations and it's so good.

Speaker 11:         00:48:43       Or the owner will come in and he's like, I don't like how you're doing this, whatever. And then the employee who now has equity will say, well, you're not my boss.

Speaker 3:          00:48:52       Fuck you. Marcus comes in and he's like, well yeah, he's right. Fuck you. You suck. And then they always go like, oh, well I, I, it's my company and I'm going to run it the way I am. And the market is like, well, you wrote it the way you are. Then this business is going to be out of. You're going to be closing the doors in two days because you don't know how to run a business and it's so great. So that's what's happening in Papa John's. There's a full on a mutiny at Papa Johns. He hasn't been outed. His faces off all of the branding. Remember Papa John Built this company. He is fucking name right now. It's Steve Papa Steve's house. Welcome to Steve's house. So there were moving his face even at the headquarters. They're doing a huge makeover at the headquarters where they're removing his face off the welfare check.

Speaker 11:         00:49:42       It's not worth the money they're spending on all.

Speaker 3:          00:49:44       Well, they're betting well, they must be hurting again. They're in like full panic mode and so they've even gone as far as to remove the apostrophe from Papa John's Papa John's international filed paperwork about the new spelling and brand imagery with the US patent and trademark office in late August. Removing the possessive apostrophe and Papa Johns would in theory provide a more distance between the company and its founder so it doesn't look like he owns the business. That is the dumbest shit. The funny name. So it's bumper John's without unimpressed by it. It doesn't make sense. It's a, it's a possessive s. his name is Papa John. So what is the [inaudible] indicates the basic grammar that I do know. Not grammatically correct. Yeah. Isla is, she's fluent in English and um, so anyway, the apostrophe is out. That faith is out and they have released this heart wrenching. I'm really powerful movement.

Speaker 3:          00:50:54       Did you, do you like the, you know, look so lame. It's not down. Not the Papa John. I know. And love by the way. They are also removing the better ingredients. Better Pizza I read. That's a classic level by the way guys. It's not that fucking serious you're selling pies. But anyway, save that because they made this ad that they posted on their twitter and it's like a whole campaign about like a, we're so sorry. We are so disappointed. We have to do better. And it's like the saddest, most emotional shit ever. And I would like to play that for you now with your permission. Actually, I don't need your permission. You have no control over the show.

Speaker 8:          00:51:41       I hope you'll enjoy it. So they compiled a bunch of tweets that they got.

Speaker 3:          00:51:47       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:51:47       Huh.

Speaker 3:          00:51:49       You know what? I wonder if it's really hurting their business or they or they're freaking out because they're getting like social media backlash. Well, the easiest way to look at this stock thought value, Papa John's. I mean people who looks like they're. I mean it looks pretty well actually in the five days. Okay. Hang on, let me, let me, let me open this up here. This is the one year graph you guys can see. It looks like they took a big hit recently from the Papa. Okay, let's go to five years. Let's just get. Oh yeah, they took a big hit. Let's go max years. Let's see. The historical data here. Okay. That's not that helpful. Let's go five years. So you can see, do one year, one year they took a big hit from Papa, Papa, John, but they're climbing back and I think yeah, I guess see, it's hard to know if it's from their efforts or people are just over it and they want people to again, they just want pizza, you know? But they're like, no, it's an apostrophe like that. A pause, freak, genius. We made a billion dollars. I just looked it up and I see an article that says it was from the beginning of August that their sales overall, nationally, it was down to seven percent. I mean that. That is significant. I mean it's not as much as I expected it on. It's not a huge difference, but it's. The old logo is superior. I agree. Just like their pizza. Anyway, I'm. Here we go.

Speaker 8:          00:53:22       We heard you papa John's.

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       I am so disappointed in this company. I'll never order it.

Speaker 8:          00:53:28       Neil again. So it's like all this to eight. I'd rather have frozen pizza then racist

Speaker 2:          00:53:34       pizza. They're really owning it. Like they're actually like railing the original pop up because they're being like, we are race. We weren't racist pizza. But that was, that was, that was that fucking guy who made this company that we're all riding. Racism is disgusting and I won't support it.

Speaker 8:          00:53:55       The Leaf poppage nice name. Remember when we were actually making progress in civil rights issues, you expected better from Papa John's.

Speaker 2:          00:54:06       Why is this? Why is the music of like a suicide prevention? It's like Papa John's. The company is on suicide watch purpose. David Papa Steve's on suicide watch. You expected better from Papa John's. So did wait. What does he make of all this was sitting at home watching this shit. He wants to be furious. Yeah. Papa's into what is both. Think about this a little too late on this. Blaming players for poor sales with dog whistle racism with a half move.

Speaker 8:          00:54:42       Yeah. It's just a bunch of these kinds of tweaks. I will not give you any more money. I don't know what anything will do to earn my business ever again. Won't put another diamond to Papa John's. Not the poor company. Until you change your policies,

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       pitiful. Look in the mirror. Stop the flip and blame and do better. Thank you for your anger. It's almost like pathetic. How like a. it's like stand up for yourself, Papa. John, thank you for your anger. Thank you for your criticism and thank you for your honesty. I'm going to call the police. I think Papa John's on suicide watch. I don't want to get an officer over there to the headquarters. Not going to hurt themselves. The whole company, the whole company. Thank you for your honesty is making us better. Just like our pizza. Better ingredients, better pizza. We already have the best pizza, but your honesty is making us as people better.

Speaker 4:          00:55:43       What did I go to Papa John's sitting at home like Steve, what did I do to deserve this disrespect? Just by company. I built this company with my own hands. I tossed the dough. I made the ingredients. What did I do to deserve this disrespect from you?

Speaker 4:          00:56:05       Let's look at my son Bowl. What is my son bought to do? He was meant to inherit this pizza and bio. Pair me with that music. You guys for Christ sake. My son, Beau was to inherit this pizza empire. Oh, seriously? Both lost like everything. My son, he's a good boy. He was meant to inherit this pizza. Why? If you had to deal with his dad, but it was like, at least I'm going to get this. Yes. At least that. But now, now ball is not in the house. Neither is the walk. Test respect. Stevie, you're my trusted colleagues now. I can trust you more than anyone. You're going to remove the apostrophe. It's my company. It's. It's in the name of my trust him brother rather stately bop.

Speaker 4:          00:57:07       I sit at home. When I think about my mistakes, I maybe I said the n word on a conference. We've got the best pizza. I built it with my hands and the sauce, the sauce, Alfredo sauce, my son. I'll Fred Fred stuff, and now I'm disgraced in the eyes of the world, the Papa John's. The NFL doesn't bother me. Butter, garlic sauce. Phasey. I love the butter garlic sauce and no running ads on twitter. You never portray the family. I feel for you as the Godfather, Papa, John, and now what do you. What's next? You're going to rub off the fact that the guy that's buying shots and know that you've got to get rid of the better pizza, better ingredients to serve. This is inheritances. Hit me with the puppy in the house. Welcome.

Speaker 3:          00:58:44       Well, you book. Oh my God, I can't do that for hours, is what they got funneled the best movie ever. It is. It really is. Because you've made it. I mean, yeah, that's really a controversial statement too about that was really brave of you to come out and say that. So brave. Nobody else agrees with that, but I'm. You're athletic. You're saying. I'm like, really the best. Not just, Oh, it's the best. You know why it's like, is it really the best? But I think it is. Well, I'll tell you why it's the best and it's simple. It's all, and this is why I love Casa so much. It's just good acting a good story and that's it. It's pure cinematic beauty. It's beautifully directed, acted and written. There's no special effects. There's no gimmicks. It's just beautiful cinema, you know, and you're suck. Then every from scene to scene, you are firmly and golf. I love the first, like 20 minutes or whatever the wedding you come to me, Stevie us to be. Is that his name? Stevie. Steve. Steve, you come to me on the day of my daughter's wedding and you ask, can you be CEO? And I say to you, Steve, Steve, ricky, Steve, Richie has do. What did I do to deserve this disrespect?

Speaker 3:          01:00:10       My son, Beau, he was teased all throughout high school. He was meant to have this path. Right, and you'll take it from him, but we never did anything like that. My son Boldo, he was gonna. It was a pizza. Brent's now it's pizza. You think Bowie is going to be like Michael and just ruthlessly to control the Papa John's empire? That'd be amazing. I want a three part trilogy about Papa. Can you play that music? We just love it. The Godfather music. Now I'm over to it. I just want to watch the godfather though. Did we watch enough of this now? If you close this? Definitely. I have some. Shake my head. Pray for you guys to do better. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:01:04       Moving forward. Well, what? We didn't finish it. Oh, I guess that's it.

Speaker 3:          01:01:08       I love other posturing of like war on suicide watch. We don't have any plans or we're not telling you anything. Just that were on suicide watch. Yeah. There wasn't really a promise at the end to do better or anything was there. It was just like there is something like what? The values. You want me to open this io? Yeah, you got it open right? Here you go. Our core values, they link to this. This is a film you want me to read this here? Hit Me with the godfather music.

Speaker 8:          01:01:41       I was appointed the CEO of Papa John's earlier this year. As the new CEO, I want to share the values that will drive the transformation of Papa John's. I stated my career in pizza business 25 years ago because pizza brings people together. Unlike that piece of shit. Papa Johns who was brought the foundation of everything we are to the ground. I found a home at Papa John's where people from all backgrounds work side by side. Every Papa Johns is 120,000 corporate and franchise team members around the world. We stand for equity, fairness, respect, and

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       are most important. Ingredient is people. Will they have people in their pizzas? That's kind of a revelation when I became CEO. I want to do this in the godfather voice, but it doesn't make sense. That's going to be too slow.

Does anyone care? We're assembling a special advisory group comprises of nationally respected diversity, equity, and inclusion experts to help guide us. It's fucking by. We're kicking off the development of two key longterm initiatives. Papa John, my minority owned franchise expansion and development program. The fuck does that mean? What does that mean?

Retired playing with the kids. That's what Papa John Shatner's doing right now. Not to have a heart attack and fall over and fucking die. Well, he'll always have the pizza mansion. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       Kong. Oh Man, dude, you guys are gonna. Love this story. This is honestly one of the best, most cold blooded fuck it and cut throat things I've ever seen in my life. Um, this Republican candidate for Congress, I'm trying to think of. I have it backwards. Well, anyway, this guy who's, I don't, I forget whose party or what. That doesn't really matter, but a congressman is running and his opponent goes to his family recruits five of his siblings, brothers and sisters, and they star and this hit job commercial against their brother. Their called the uh, go go sards. And um, I'm coining a new phrase right now. You just got go hard because I have never seen. It's so cold blooded day. You've got to see this. It's crazy. Fuck me. So these are all his siblings just talking shit on him. And then at the end they do a little doop doop twist on you,

Speaker 10:         01:06:29       closer to the congressman. Isn't doing anything to help rural America. Paul's absolutely not working for his district. If they care about healthcare, they care about their children's healthcare. They would hold the family's fucked up. They care about jobs. They would hold him to account if he actually cared about me.

Speaker 3:          01:06:51       So far it doesn't say I ruined the surprise because yeah, I ruined the surprise for everybody by. They'll get out of that field like you like you've actually in that field all the time. Oh, you caught me out in the field and nature. Oh, hi. There was just in nature. Jennifer Arizona.

Speaker 10:         01:07:12       I bet he'd be fighting for source of security for better access to healthcare. I better he. I bet he would be researching what is the most insightful water policy so angry to feel the environment of Arizona sustain itself and be successful and he's not listening to you and he's doesn't have your interests at heart. My name is tim goes sour. David. Joan goes, are to go. Sorry Jennifer, go star. Paul goes, here's my brother. My brother and I endorsed Dr. Brill, Dr. Brill wholeheartedly. Endorse Dr David. Root for Congress

Did I don't know what that guy's technique is, but he's up to some like Dr. Brill was like, I'll make him an offer. He can't refuse what? That's dude. He got the first ever go sergeant. Go starting when your whole family, when all of your loved ones close to betray you. Interesting stuff. Huh? I love the top comment on the youtube is I'm the ghost or thanksgiving. This year is going to be awkward. Yeah, that's an understatement. God, seriously. Someone said this is the new game of thrones season eight, trailer Rudel. All this shit isn't unbelievable. Like fuck. Like even if you hate your brother, right? Even if you hate your brother, your brother's sucks and you disagree with them politically and he's running for office. I mean really? Are you going to go with a feature like five of them? Not One. That's such a bad ass, like little promotion video. How did they even put. How did Dr Fucking evil put that Dr Brill. How did they even arranged that? You know what I mean? Who came up with it? They woke up with a horse head in their bed. Dr. Brill sent the mcallen card, I'll make them an offer. They can't refuse. This family hit me with the music.

Speaker 4:          01:09:27       This goes, you're going to start this ad. I thought your brother, you may not like it. You'll understand and there'll be a time when I will do a favor for you. It's getting tough to do that. Your throat is saying, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:09:48       Where your throat is over you. My throat is over that bit as is everyone listening the comments on this video, right? So funny. Fucking ghosts are man. Hey. Hi Guys. Hey Gang. It's me. Dr. Brill. So I'm running against your brother for Congress and I was just hoping if you would all be um, available to fucking destroy your brother publicly and my commercial. Absolutely. Doctor, are you a savage? Are you, are you going to savages? I'm a total savage. You know what? I got to tell you,

Speaker 3:          01:10:33       I don't know anything about the guy they're shitting on, but this Dr. burdall scares the shit out and I'm not sure I want him in office because that's the coldest shit I've ever seen in my life. Like even if you can get all the siblings to make a video about that twist, I know and it was made like artfully, right? Like Shakespearean, like even if you could make this, do you really want to be that guy that like tore the family apart for a good political ad? You know what I'm saying? It's cold. I feel like I need the backstory of what's going on in that either way. Or is this a fucking uh, Arizona,

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       those motherfuckers are crazy in Arizona. Shit, I am Dr. Brill. And if you don't vote for me, I will kill you. I'm Dr Brill and I will kill your whole family feud. Not cast your vote for me. This, uh, coming September.

You know how there's like drones in Afghanistan bombing people and I endorse this message. I endorse our click. Those drone murder buttons so fast. That was a huge controversy when Obama was president because he had all these drones in Afghanistan, just like dropping bombs all day, so he's loved. Brill is loving that. I will add. My name is Dr. Brill and I pledged to drone strike American citizens in the United States. I'm cold blooded as it gets real and you don't want to mess with me. Pretty much. I am Dr. Brill and if you run against me, I will ruin your whole life and tear your family apart and then drone strike your house. If I'm elected. This guy scares the shit out of me.

Speaker 5:          01:12:38       Damn fucking crazy.

This could only have been Russia, woman buried and Russian graveyard is given a five foot high tombstone and the shape of her favorite iphone. Well, there you have it folks. Apparently that's real.

I mean, there you have it, rest in peace. They're just covered in snow and I ended up back on the back. It even had its like really realistic. It's got buttons and everything. Does it have a case? It might have a case on it. Yes. There she is. Crushing it, crushing it and crushing it.

This girl's amazing. So that's a really nice. More than that. I just thought it was interesting. Apparently her father built the tombstone after her death dedicated her. That's kind of a loving act honestly. Yeah. Um, can I play you something? I get this voicemail from these fucking. I hate these people. They call me sometimes twice a day and they do this thing where it doesn't even ring. It just goes straight to voicemail. Right. Hold on, let me find this fucking thing.

Speaker 2:          01:17:21       on this one. And only h three podcasts experience.

Speaker 2:          01:17:28       Uh, what do we got from Mom Zang? Me and my buddy made. Oh, this is a new one. Yeah, this one's a little tricky. Let me see. Oh, these are all new ones. Okay. So wait, how does this work? Then you added this one at the top. I just added to a last night. If you just scroll down a little bit, there'll be all the ones that you. Uh, okay. I haven't seen these ones yet, so I don't want to put them up yet. A company. Did you know what the Fuck God damn company, if. How's it going, boss? There's a group of people that don't, not for 100 days. Plus the reasons are interesting with like your perspective from Ghia. Uh, the no fat is a community online I have heard of and I'm intrigued by their activities. Now these are people that believe that by not masturbating or looking at pornography, they gain superhuman powers essentially.

Speaker 2:          01:18:29       In fact, I pulled up, I was doing some research because I'm aware of the group, but this was one of the top post of all time on the no Phipps subreddit. And so this is what they outlined happens to you when you do not masturbate. Over the course of 10 years, my God, 10 years not fucking drinking your own filth. Ds Meet Anyway, five minutes. Wow. I'm, I'm five minutes. Your heart rate will return back to normal. Okay? Two to three days. Guilt and shame. Seems like it is decreasing. Seven days. Brain fog will lift. School will get easier for you. Fourteen days. Prolastin also known as, okay, they're getting scientific starts to drop. Fourteen to 21 days. Dopamine sensitivity increases. Thirty days. Craving and flashbacks will noticeably reduce 30 days, 60 days. It becomes rock solid and confidence keeps rising. Uh, 60 days. You might stop giving a fuck what other people think about what it's like when your bio facial lotion or something or all the benefit of like write everything you wish will have diamond water.

Speaker 2:          01:19:37       I'm at 90 days considered a full reboot for most people. Confident, still rising. One hundred 50 days. Symptoms of severe pied disappear on prep. I know what it is, but I liked the sound of that 200 days. I feel like every girl wants to fuck me and I started reading a Bible of this as far as I can tell isn't a job. This guy found God after 200 days a one year. I don't even know why I was watching porn a year ago, two years now. I have a amazing job and I've never been happier. Really. They'll from not masturbating 10 years. My life has just been amazing. Ever since I stopped masturbating. I'm 10 years. This guy's dead serious, which is kind of funny and a little pathetic, but if I'm a speaking frankly, there is an interesting theory and not masturbating because I do think that like porn addiction is real and I do think that like when you look like looking at porn is really unhealthy because you do.

Speaker 2:          01:20:42       It's like when you look at porn and you just know any finished real fast, it is kind of like a high. Like you get this like you know, if you're like in a bad mood or whatever. A lot of guys I think rely on like a Kurt, a quick jerk. I'll quick porn watch as a treatment to a bad mood. A lot of guys or a lot of guys that know, I think it's very common and so they'll watch some porn, they'll jerk one out real quick and then you're like, uh, and then you get on with your day. But there is really I think something to this idea that like your dopamine, your reward levels and shit got all whacked out and it really is like an addiction. And so I do think that there is probably some good benefits to at least not looking at porn,

Speaker 2:          01:21:29       but I've also read that masturbating daily for guys is healthy because it helps prevent prostate cancer because you're constantly, you know, pushing everything out of your tubes or if you let it sit there, like that's how colon cancer happens to it because you don't, the more you ship, the less likely you are to get colon cancer because you don't want that stuff sitting there for so long. It's the same theory with the a nut juice. So I am intrigued, but at the same time I'm sure that it's probably not that serious. Are you gonna know fap? I'm in, I'll go. I'll know fat for like a day. I'm already at five minutes. My heartbeat feels pretty normal. Guilt and shame. Definitely. That's two to three days. So I haven't reached that level yet, but we all get milestones. My, my best record so far is three hours. So I don't know, I'm intrigued by it. I'd like to hear from a no fabric. I'd like to take a call from somebody who, um, who, who has gone a long time without masturbating to Kinda hear there, you know, I heard something interesting about Mike Tyson when he used to go box when he was young, like God, like boxer, he wouldn't masturbate or have sex for like months leading up to his fight because it would get them all crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:22:58       Kind of interesting. That's interesting. Yeah. Um, I'm interested, you know, they're called fap too, by the way. I swear to God and that's what it says in their fucking description. Yeah. I don't know. Do any of you guys are back there? Are you in any of this? Into this? No. Flapping, definitely not. Absolutely not. What about Zach and m? You guys? I mean, it's relaxing. It's looks like it's all know back. Lots of a sheepish knows frequent masturbatory. Yes. We all are frequent exacerbaters. I wonder how frequently do you guys masturbate? Probably like once a day and Zach and, uh, in a interest that he's done it twice since the show started. So no, don't be. I want to, I'm, I'm genuinely curious. I'm taking a sample here, I'd say about, I don't know,

Speaker 2:          01:23:56       once every two days, once every two days. Every two days. It's pretty conservative. That's conservative. You're a young man. Should be jerking off. Like fight with Zach. Just turned 21 and I want to know how much Ian masturbates. I feel like he's asleep. He jerks like eight times a day. That's a little offensive. Well, how am, to be honest, I don't know. Forty eight hour window. Forty eight hour. That's pretty responsible. I'm like once a day. I guess when I was younger there'll be days when I was younger there'd be like eight times in a day. That wasn't like common, but some days it's like your Dick actually gets hurt. It's like, Whoa Dude, you need to get a life, but you have. But we've all been there, right? Nothing better to do.

Speaker 2:          01:24:45       I, I get why the people I get why these people. I'm like, you said, you know, intellectually I see that there can be some benefit to it, especially with what you were saying about, you know, relaxing your reward center and uh, well, and when you jerk off in the middle of the day, it can fuck your whole day up. You know what I mean? Why? Because you just get so sleepy and lazy and then all of a sudden you're like, you just have no motivation because you jerked off in the middle of the day. It's like, and you're, you know what I mean? It's like, what do you, where do you go from there? Take a nap. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:25:22       No fat. I'm intrigued. Good question. Thank you. Gift for that. Uh, enlightening. Vigorous debate. Thank you. And God bless Ya. Next up from pee Layton, I work in the vape industry and I always listen to your podcasts while I'm here as a fellow member of the nation. I would love to hear any commentary you guys have on the new FDA regulations for vaping products in regards to packaging and advertisings and the law to ban flavors and the epidemic of teen vaping. Sincerely, xxx vape wizard for 20 x x x Hashtag [inaudible] a great question. So the FDA, this is

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       actually quite interesting and then you would know about this because it affects you directly, is that the FDA is banning flavored vape juices because they say it appeals to kids. That is pretty much par for the course of my pain because they did the same thing to alcohol and tobacco where they really restricted how they could market it because they didn't want it to appeal to kids. And frankly I do feel like vaping has become a really severe gateway drug. I don't know if you want to say gay or whatever, but I haven't seen it firsthand, but I've heard that a lot of kids in like middle school and high school, I walk around with these tiny little vape pen and actually smoking, um, which I find pretty wild because it's almost like everybody stopped smoking cigarettes. They're all like, we all understand it's not cool. It's really bad for you. But now it's almost like there's a new problem where super accessible and everyone's like, oh, it's not as bad. So it's okay. I think we don't really know how bad it is yet. Maybe it's not that bad. Maybe it's not. Maybe it is. I don't know, but I think it's probably a good idea that, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:27:21       what the fuck do I know,

Speaker 9:          01:27:24       Dan? What do you think? I mean, I'm really of two minds of it because I'm on the one hand, you know, I, I think, you know, obviously it's bad. I don't know how prevalent it really is with kids. Like, is it more than when we were in high school kids smoking cigarettes?

Speaker 3:          01:27:41       Apparently it's, it is extremely. Uh, it's, it's very, it's like overwhelming from, from what I understand. Again, I'm, I'm not

Speaker 9:          01:27:52       so, I mean present that that is, that is probably not good admittedly. But is it, I mean, banning the flavors, is that really gonna do anything to prevent that? You think like it's really specific flavors,

Speaker 3:          01:28:05       like a Unicorn. What I remember when I was a kid, I would go, whenever we come to la, my mom would take me to this candy store that I loved and the one candy I would always get, I loved it so much was bubble gum cigarettes, you believe this and it was gum wrapped in like they had a bunch of powdered sugar so you could go and it would puff out sugar. I think. I know that it was so cool smoking a cigarette and I think I forgot that existed and I used to love it too. Yeah, I logged it as a kid and looking back on that, it's like, Whoa, that's pretty fucked up. That was my favorite. I will go get it. And I thought was so cool. Every time. Those are not sure. Those are band. Yeah. I love so. I Dunno. I don't know. What the hell do I know? Thanks for the question. A half priced teddy,

Speaker 2:          01:29:04       teddy friends because you ain't getting no half off. Right? It was full price. Yeah, half price. Did A. Hey, my name's Josh. Had been a huge fan. You guys are the best youtube channel. Best Channel on Youtube. Thank you. And you know, I mean, thank you so much. Tell me more. Uh, well, not the biggest trend. I was wondering, have you ever heard of a movement called stop a douchebag? It's a movement in Russia in which a group of people stop others from parking and illegal places such as sidewalks, railroads by approaching them carefully. Sometimes they will blow up with huge amounts of ignorance and other will move straight to physical violence. If they don't comply then they get a huge sticker on their windshield. They have a nice amount of subs. And was wondering what you guys think. Does this solution even work? This is productive or should there be other actions taken? Just curious. Thank you for the kind words, Josh. I believe he had said, and if I can quote him, you are by far the best channel on Youtube from Josh half-priced. Ted, you are by far the best channel on Youtube. He said about us. Um, thank you for that. So let's go. Actually, yeah, I do know about these guys. Stop a douchebag and actually pulled up the video and we can watch it together. Oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          01:30:21       Once I have a quick look here. Yeah. So I mean apparently in Russia it's a little more like a medieval. Like motherfuckers just, you see the shit, they're crazy. There's traffic and there's limited. So just hopping up on the sidewalk, it's a little more, it's a little more lawless probably in some places in Russia. So these guys are vigilantes and they're like, this is fucked up. [inaudible] cities. Our sidewalk don't, you know, don't drive on the sidewalk is dangerous. Right. So they call it stop a douchebag and they were taking vigilante justice into their own hands, just like Batman essentially.

Speaker 8:          01:31:06       Can I ask you why you parked your bus on the sidewalk?

Speaker 2:          01:31:08       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:31:09       Uh, he says it's a service bus. What the service bus. I can't hear you. Unfortunately. We are waiting for some people to get on. Okay. Well, could you move your bus at least you parked right on the sidewalk. People push their shopping carts here. He doesn't seem to give a fuck. You won't be able to get around. Or can you move your truck please? Thank you. And they're asking the guy and he does so there you have it, vigilante justice, but sometimes the

Speaker 2:          01:31:48       blurred defined and I guess that's when it gets a little while.

Speaker 8:          01:31:52       Um, there's a Mercedes that's on the sidewalk. They stop him. He said, oh, the guy

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       says this won't happen again. I'm late. I'm sorry. Okay. Back your car please. They say it's almost like catch a Predator vibe. It's like, I wonder if they know these guys in Russia because he's like, oh, you caught me at will never happen again. I'm going to pull out. No, no, no. Back up there saying you can't. They're not letting them

Speaker 8:          01:32:19       pull out there making them back up. I know all people are equal. All must drive back. So they send this guy back. The guy knew what was good for a man. Well, let's see if this guy does. This guy is not having that. I could tell you right now,

Speaker 2:          01:32:34       sky was kind of sheepish. He was like kind of on the road on the sidewalk. This guy is fully occupying the sidewalk. There's a huge line of traffic. And this guy's driving on this

Speaker 8:          01:32:43       sidewalk. I'm running late, she says, for a friend's wedding. Understand, but can you please back to the roadway guys? I need to be at the river. Go station 20 minutes, Yada Yada. At sidewalk on lake. Do you relative. You're on a footpath for the blind right now. I do understand, but sometimes things come up. She said, oh, everyone's been really polite. No. Oh, she went around. I was just running around them. Oh, are they going to catch up to her? So she drew. Oh really? So they're chasing after she went around them and book that out. And so what they do,

Speaker 2:          01:33:23       they have these giant stickers that probably fucks their whole week up. And I guess what it says in Russian is, I'm a Douche bag and it's this huge sticker. The covers the windshield, the windshield. So they pretty much can't drive. I gotta say they gave them a fair chance. It's very vigilante justice. Let's see how she reacts. You take that thing off. Oh my God just keeps driving. They put it on the passenger side. They usually put it over the driver's side. I think, let's see,

Speaker 8:          01:33:56       we've got another one. Oh, there's two. There's several cars. That whole line. The day stop a douchebag. Boom in here. Just as himself. Could you back out of your car please? And there's actually a car behind him. Stop. Or I'll put a sticker on your windshield. Oh, he's, he's pulling. He's driving into them. Trying to run them over. It. Stopped there saying I'm going to put a sticker on your windshield. I'm going to give you fucker stickier. Now they put it. So

Speaker 2:          01:34:29       got it, got it. Okay. Now this is great. By the way, is this 23 million views? So they put the sticker over the passenger side window. So there's really no way for him to drive until he gets off on the driver's side. The driver's side. So yeah, this guy's totally fucked. So he's getting out of his car though.

Speaker 8:          01:34:50       He's not happy. And he's got. He's got cargo, military pants on, he's throwing a sandals out. He's getting ready to kick some ass in those sandals. This guy scared what's going on? This guy's fucking scaring me. Let me grab the knife. Oh, he's got a weapon. He's got like a nunchuck what the funder was nunchucks what? They'll get the fuck out of here. Ugly motherfucker. Where do I go? Oh, he took his nun, chuck and threw it in the woods because it's like 20 years.

Speaker 7:          01:35:18       Oh man,

Speaker 8:          01:35:21       he's trying to get the sticker off, but it's not really coming off now. This guy days. Fuck, I don't care where I'm driving and you see my fucking tag skylight mafia or something. And these guys are hardcore. I've got to say.

Speaker 3:          01:35:39       I know that there's like a lot of mafia ties in Russia. So I, I, these guys are pretty brave. I would say to do this. I mean, I don't know much about Russia. Even regardless, wouldn't the Mafia. There's just, you never know this guy could have a gun in just or nunchuck in this case they stood their ground man. And these are, these are brave kids. I think there's a brave kids doing a valuable public service. That's my take from this right now. And that's what the sticker is a pretty innocent but strong way of being like, fuck you. And they also give every they to take it off. Don't goof off the only way. But what I like about them, if they don't immediately throw the sticker on, they say, hey, we're here to keep peace on the sidewalk. Can you please back up? And if they do, they don't fuck with their car. So I think these guys have struck a good balance of vigilante justice here.

Speaker 8:          01:36:36       Saying, man, that guy is so fun to drive. His whole view was obstructed and he continues to try to drive forward getting more stickers. So he continues to try to drive more and they're putting more stickers on his windshield and they're actually laying on the front of the car. They have. This guy's having a fucked up day. Oh, there's someone else in the car. Oh girl was wipes in the car. Imagine being natural. Yeah. Wow. This guy. This is some shit. He's getting out. He's getting angry now. Oh, he punches now. They're throwing punches. Here we go. Oh Man. These vigilante. Poke him out. Let me help you up. Well, that's a humiliation.

Speaker 3:          01:37:24       Wow. That was. That was amazing. The guy came out through applying, now they've got this one huge ass like you know in rocky, they have like the super like USSR, boxer. They got one of these guys. He's like the guy that confronts. So this guy came out, threw a punch and Ivan Drago, Ivan Drago basically body dropped him and then he's like, here, let me help you up to complete the humiliation. Wow. This guy's days. Fuck. There's three stickers on it.

Speaker 8:          01:37:52       I wonder who's. I wonder what the police say when they come.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       Oh, here's what the sticker says. It says, I spit on everyone. I drive where I want. Stop a Douche bag. That's what it says in Russian. Hmm. Wow. That's amazing stuff, man. These kids are brave and they're doing a valued publix. That's a really cool. Cool. Thank you to Josh, who by the way said you are by far my favorite channel on Youtube. So shout out to Josh. I'm Matt Duncan's one that we. Yeah, I wasn't sure what. That's all right. I'm gonna. Move on. Matt says, there was another bathroom habit I did that I realized was normal seven years ago. I was talking to members of my tennis team in my freshman year of college. Whenever I used a Urinal or went pee, I would always whip out my balls along with my penis to peep. I would pull the waistband under my balls and that always felt more comfortable and natural and when I brought it up to my teammates, I realized I was the only one that did that among the team.

Speaker 2:          01:39:03       I was so embarrassed and I have since changed my habits and I do not whip out my balls anymore to pee, but I miss it. Is this normal? Do you whip out your balls to p or just your. Your Rod as well? I would love your thoughts. Well, Matt, I'm so happy that you brought this to me because I feel like here at the podcast we're smashing taboos. We are bringing things out to light that people don't talk about and we are normalizing behaviors that are normal and good and just now before I get it, now before I get into that, all I want to say that we've converted a lot of people. A lot of people have been shamed to wiping their ass from the back, which is clownish. It's ridiculous. It's not convenient. It's not as good. A lot of people have taken the time at home to sit and cut their balls and pianists in their hand and to scoop under while sitting comfortably with the other hand and they found that that's a superior method.

Speaker 2:          01:40:00       Now, I'm not going to tell you right now that the front way is superior even though you have to be a fucking cave man to stand up and squat and reach behind your ass and wipe side decided to clean your asshole. I'm not going to tell you that. I think once we pick out, I'm just. What I am saying is that I don't think that US front wipers need to be ostracized. I don't think we need to be outcast and demean because we approach problems differently. Now I come to this issue of whipping the balls out. Now, this sweet young man, Matt was, he was, um, you know, he was, he was ridiculed by his teammates. Well, let me tell you, Matt, I always take my balls out fucking proudly and you know why you take your balls out and Matt, because you're smart and you know what, what makes sense?

Speaker 2:          01:40:48       Now if you just take your dick out, you've got nothing to rest your pants on. Now you're probably like me. You use a waste. It works with the elastic waist. If you're wearing an elastic waist pants like I often do, you put the waste under your balls because if you just take your dick out, you have to hold. It looks ridiculous. It's like a little tick tack peeking over a fucking Mole Hill. You need to take the balls out. You got to let it all breathe and that's an important thing and I personally find it superior. Now, Matt, don't let people tell you that you're not that. That's not the right way to do it because that's just the absolute outright disgusting criminal conspiracy. Live to deep state line when I won't stand for you. Take your balls out along with your Dick and now everyone is homes.

Speaker 2:          01:41:37       I'm like, oh no, I'm going to try that. And then you're going to find out, oh, I like taking my balls out. They'll do wrong with it. It was all good guys backstage. Do you take your balls out? You know what it kind of depends on, on. It depends on what you're wearing. It's situational highly situations and the others, if you're wearing jeans into the mic, you really have no option if you wear jeans shirt. But if you're wearing like a, like a basketball shorts than. Yeah, absolutely. There you go. You see that? There you go. And Ian finally never. Well in. You don't have to strike that tone. I'm trying to encourage young masculine. Tone it down, right? Not that serious in his balls aren't coming out. Yeah, they're not coming. They're staying in there. Thank you matt for the question and I wish you all the best in life and all of your bowl whipping out journeys. And finally from cow. First of all, I want to say how much I love you guys and everything that you do. Well, thank you very much. Cow A cow. I love you guys and everything that you do. Thank you [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:42:52       Love to hear that and that through you. I found a ton of other creators and content that I would never have all my own. That being said, I want to see Ethan kind of a personal question. How are you capable of confirming and admitting you were depressed? Oh, I want to answer this, but I feel like it's an awful way to end the show. We were just having a good time with the balls out. We can do it next time. Yeah, I will say that for next time. I do want to answer this. He says I'll just finish. Currently, I'm sort of a social stigma at my university that depression is a choice and a sign of weakness and I know that I'm definitely not happy. How do you detect this and how are you dealing with it currently if you don't feel comfortable answering? Well I do. I'll answer it. I think I can answer it without being like super depressing. I agree. When I was in college there was a really big stigma about being depressed and I'm sure I was depressed at the time and I think it's really well. I think it's changed, but it's really fucked up because I remember at my college dorm there was a sign

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       on the wall with like Prozac and it was some kind of insinuation that like, um, if you take it your week or something or not, that was the subtext because it was really like a how fucked up is society that everybody's taking Prozac. Right. And then sinuation is like, oh, you don't need that shit. I wasn't on anything like that. But um, I agreed. I saw that and I was like, Oh yeah, everyone's on drugs, you know? Um, the idea of treating depression was something like a. yeah, it was very stigma. It was like, like I said in the uptivity, it's not sexy to be depressed. It's like it's pathetic. Just sounds pathetic. Like there's two kinds of price. They're like everyone is depressed and then there's like the real, the real depressed in his treatment. And maybe people just like combine it. The people who.

Speaker 3:          01:44:49       Yeah, well the people who, everyone gets depressed sometimes, but people who get depressed sometimes don't understand what it's like to be depressed for two years. So that's why I think there was a disconnect there. It's just, it's a, it's a, it's just a disconnect. It's a misunderstanding. But be that as it may, you know, I think I've been depressed for a really long time and I remember I always, I always knew that I had really severe anxiety. I mean I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder when I went off to college and it was like really crippling all throughout college. And I had accepted that I had a problem. But I remember the first time when we were living in Israel, I saw a psychiatrist.

Speaker 5:          01:45:35       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:45:36       Um, because of my anxiety was really bad, or maybe I was, I was having some kind of weird thing and I just wanted to talk to a therapist and he had said, I told him, yeah, it was a therapist and I was talking about my symptoms and I was like, you know, I'm anxious and I, there's this one thing that I get all the time that I still get, which is that I get like foggy brain and I feel like not myself. I feel like I'm having a bad high. And um, I really hate that feeling. So awful. And then the therapist was like, oh, so, um, it sounds like you have depression. And that shocked me. I was almost offended. I was like, I don't. I'm like, I have anxiety, not depression. I was actually genuinely defensive and I was like, what? Like fuck, like fuck you, I don't have, I'm, I have anxiety. And my reaction was very much like, like, fuck you dude. And uh, that was like, that must've been like seven years ago probably. It was when we were living in Ramat Gan gun and I've never treated it or anything like, um, but

Speaker 3:          01:46:55       I've been like desperate enough where I was like, oh, I need some fucking help. And so that's why I want to talk to that guy and I'm, yeah, I just remember being really defensive and uh, that's. And that, that was so long ago and now it's come to the point where I've slowly kind of realized that like my anxiety has given away at that. It's morphed into something else. Like in college, my anxiety was just this crippling a,

Speaker 3:          01:47:28       I don't know. Well, it's free. It's frequent that anxiety and depression go hand in hand, you know? And so yeah, the more I thought about it and the more time I had to accept that, I realized that it was probably at this point more depression than there is anxiety. It's kind of like I addressed the anxiety because I accepted that that's what I had. And so, but the depression, I was so, I didn't want to have it so bad that I ignored it and never addressed it. And so now I feel like I'm, now I'm really accepting it after looking back and thinking how I feel. I mean, look at the, um, just read the symptoms, man. For me it's like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Like, let me read this off. Like if I go there now, but it's like, you know, I'm here. Let me see. This shit was like fucking 100 percent. Yes. I'm just trying to find this list of uh, symptoms come up for fuck sake. Um, let's see. Some signs you might have depression, sad, empty, anxious, helpless, worthless or guilty or hopeless, irritable,

Speaker 3:          01:48:59       less interested in activities, less energetic. Trouble concentrating, changes in the way you sleep. I sleep great. That's it. Everything else though, changes in appetite. I'm always hungry. Aches and pains. Not really actually, but everything else. Like I'm sad, empty, anxious. Always helpless, worthless, guilty. Always. Like I got to the point now where I was like, I'm really now decided to like actually treat this because it's become unbearable for me recently is that I was, I'm like always at war with myself and my head, like torturing myself. Like every little thing, like social things pass things, things that happen. A long time ago things had happened now on day to day basis, small things like you'll say something and then you're like torture or I'll do something. Anything, but it's like I'm always feeling guilty or is it just like the dumbest things like and you know, that, but just always at war with myself in my head. Hopeless, pessimistic, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:50:02       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:50:03       Irritable, big time. Fucking so irritable and I hate being irritable because you know, like, you know that you have, you shouldn't be but you are as the worst and you just can't help it. You just like fuck that. Everything annoys me but. And I don't and I so don't want to be an asshole. I so don't want to be an asshole right now, but I'm just so irritated. I hate that and I would feel that all the time,

Speaker 5:          01:50:30       like

Speaker 3:          01:50:31       all the time everyday. So in bowl and it's exhausting for you because I'm fucking not that pleasant to be around most of the time. Loss of interest in activities. I don't have hobbies. I don't enjoy doing anything. I used to love playing video games and for the past years like I don't, I didn't even listen to music. I don't even enjoy listening to music. Less energetic. Yeah. Tired all the time. Trouble concentrating. So hard for me to do shit.

Speaker 3:          01:51:08       Trouble remembering details. Isla to have trouble remembering details. Zip Code. Oh yes. Oh my God. Oh, that will drive me crazy. Ethan doesn't know the address of his home. Well, I do. Just not. There's no you don't. I do. Just not the zip. Well that's like half of the address. What else do I need to know? I don't understand why people ask for zip codes anymore. Here's the fucking address. Here's the city. You don't need this navy. I'm irritable too, but oh my God. Every time you think. Well, last zip code. It's like it's your home insurance. I don't know. Remember zip codes. I'm overwhelmed to make decisions whether big or small. Unmanned man. It was like just. I mean I was at the point recently where it was like, I cannot continue to live my life like this. I will do anything. And you guys might recall me saying that I had like this bottle of antidepressants by my bed for the longest time because I felt like I hadn't tried everything first and I feel like I took three months and I actually did make a lot of positive changes in my life, but I still felt awful,

Speaker 3:          01:52:25       I guess not. I, I made a pretty good at. For me the biggest, the biggest thing for me was like getting away from social media, from Youtube and it. But it's hard to know sometimes it's like leaving youtube sometimes makes you more anxious

Speaker 2:          01:52:47       and then everyone else gets upset and that makes you more anxious. And so it's hard. It's hard to know what is the right thing for you or whatever. But anyway, I don't know, I've never gone to therapy there. I have my first therapy appointment on Monday.

Speaker 2:          01:53:03       Pretty excited. I'm going, if he's going to fix me, right? Uh, I'll be like, alright, you know, I, I went to a therapist once through a kaiser, which is our healthcare. And it was such an awful experience. I never wanted to go again. I show up. It's like Mcdonald's therapy I show up and right out the bat, you know, you expect that. It's always like, tell me about your family. Where did you grow up? Like, get to know the guy, get comfortable. So I sit down and I swear to God, this is what he does. He goes, all right, so what's wrong? But what do you want to talk about? Like, what's bothering you? What's wrong? I was like, Whoa, like fucking go to treat a girl to dinner before you fucker. You know, I was just blown away by that. He's like, what's bothering you? We have 30 minutes. Come on. We've got plenty of. I got a lot of patients here. It was fucking crazy. I felt so uncomfortable do the whole thing because I don't know this guy. So I was like, oh well we've got a bunch of ads on my youtube channel that I don't want to do and I don't feel like making content, but I have these obligations. Then he's like, so tell me, uh, how did. So how do you make money on youtube again?

Speaker 2:          01:54:23       Was fucking awful. I love that. That's like a great name. So tell me what's bothering you, what's on your mind? Well, uh, my father, uh, raped me when I was a kid and uh, all right, well here's what you do. Just forget all about that crazy. So I'm going to a private therapists that came highly recommended from a friend. I'm really excited to Beverly Hills, but you know, he's fucking legit. Uh, yeah. Uh, but to answer your original question, took a bit of a tangent here. Your original question was, how did you confirm and admit you were depressed? Well, for me it took me a long time, um, because I was embarrassed and ashamed and I felt like people around it's kind of embarrassing thing to, Oh, I'm depressed. Oh, oh, get over it. I got an email. People just don't understand. I got an email from someone that like A.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       Anyway, whatever people don't understand. But, uh, to you, I would just ask yourself, I mean, you clearly are aware that something's off and you're not happy. There's clearly some aspects of your life that are you're not happy with and you're not comfortable with that you would like to change. They're causing you to feel possibly depressed. I would, I would consider looking at these symptoms because for me it's really just been crippling and a large part of the reason why we've just been gone for so long. But also I'm not a professional. I can't diagnose you, so you should. You should see a therapist. I feel like everyone. I know it seems like a luxury, but actually a friend of ours was telling us like, there's, there's cheap. What was the name of this place? She said, well, they have therapy on a sliding scale, so if you're broke you can go see a therapist for 20 bucks.

Speaker 5:          01:56:44       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:56:46       and also there's, there's, there's, you know, there's ways to figure it out. But ultimately I think it's important for people to know that you just, you don't have to suffer, you don't have to carry it. You got to make the decision that you're just going to fight it. Right? You don't want to be a victim to sell. Fuck you. No, fuck that.

Speaker 2:          01:57:13       It's like you're just wasting your time on this earth to feeling miserable and what's the point of that? So do what you can, you know, because there's a lot of people before you that have dealt with it and gotten out of the woods and they're really smart and they are there to help everybody else because it sucks there to help you with therapy because they're geniuses. These therapists, they have studied, they have phds. They have studied this shit for decades. They know how the brain works, right? That's, that's something. I'm just a guy. I don't know how the brain works. Right, but they can get in your head and untangle shit and understand you and ways that you can't. They've got drugs that help ease the burden while you figure it out. Yeah. No, you don't have to be miserable all. Well, if you already are miserable, what do you have to lose anyway? Because a fuck. It's like at one at, at a certain point, nothing else matters, but getting better because what does it. What does anything matter? If you're that miserable, it's just like what else? At that point matters at all except prioritizing number one yourself and getting better. You can't help anyone around. You can't do

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       anything for yourself or anyone else until you feel better. So that's my, that's my opinion. Yeah. Um, and depressions on the rise, you know, more people are feeling it more than ever because my theory personally on that is that the world is increasingly complex, complicated, difficult to find your place in the world, the find a spouse in the world to find a career, to find a purpose, to make money. Everything is so hard to figure out that. Um, and we carry a lot of stress and alongside a lot of bills, a lot of responsibility

Speaker 9:          01:59:32       generation especially like who can afford it. No fucking body.

Speaker 3:          01:59:38       Like I think about our situation. We are fortunate enough to have been able to buy a house.

Speaker 9:          01:59:44       But, but I know the feeling from you just a few years ago did we? No, no, we, we've worked all our life and we weren't even close. We have, we were on.

Speaker 3:          01:59:53       We were statistically anomalous with our success and the amount of money that we were able to make in the short time from being successful. But we've been, like you said, just a couple short years earlier, making like 30, $40,000 with you and the two of us. And um,

Speaker 3:          02:00:16       that's important. Yeah. You're like, buy a house. Never happened. So I wonder when we're in this anomalous, like an unbelievably lucky situation. How the fuck does anyone else have a chance? But it doesn't. But again, that you can be at any station of life and still life is complicated in this day and age with the Internet, with the cars, with bill's responsibility and know I'm more depressed now because I feel more lost in my purpose. And like, I actually heard a really good. I don't remember who said it, but it's like, um, when you have money and like financial safety, all that's left is in your head.

Speaker 9:          02:01:08       That was talking to about not when I. Cause I was saying before that you're always like, well, if only I could afford that trip, I wouldn't be happy. But until then I can afford it, or if I just or, or it's like if only I could afford this house, that would be perfect.

Speaker 3:          02:01:26       My thing was like, Oh, if only I couldn't, didn't pay rent, rent. I'd be set for life.

Speaker 9:          02:01:32       So you always have this like you're chasing a goal. If I then I'll be happy. Right now I'm not happy because I can't afford it. But you work towards it and it gives you a purpose. Yeah. But when you can afford it and you're still not happy, then it's like, what is that thing that will make me happy? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:01:51       But I. But anyway, I'm in, I'm in a rare situation. It's hard to relate to what I'm going through there. But just generally speaking, life is so complicated. Like think back 50 years, people didn't have phones that have fucking Internet, they just worked on farms.

Speaker 3:          02:02:08       I genuinely think that like if you just woke up at 8:00 AM and worked on the farm for eight hours and went home and ate dinner and chill, it's like that simple man. There's nothing to crave. Like that's, you know, that's. And I think that like modern day life really goes against our, are a fundamental instincts as animals, like billions of years of, of, uh, end stinks and expectation of what life is and how to survive. That's what it is, right? Billions of years of survival instincts have all of the sudden in the past 100 years completely betrayed us because all of a sudden these survival instincts that we've inherited over evolution, billions of years are no longer relevant at all. Right? And that's fucked up. So I think a lot of people have, have trouble adjusting.

Speaker 9:          02:03:09       It's weird because also you all of a sudden, I didn't have a lot of opportunities. The demon before. You have a lot of, you know, there's a lot of good that came with it. Sure. But it's also great playing. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:03:25       So, you know, I think, I think that, um, I think it's important to bear that in mind that life is really fucking can be very challenging and confusing and overwhelming. It's like my God who can balance all those things when instinctually I just want to go plant some carrots, right? Or go gather some berries or some shit or go kill a deer and then chill and the TP, you know. So anyway, I'm looking forward to the essays of disproving my theory. Well, that's just my thoughts and if you disagree, you're wrong. Anyway. I hope I wish you all the best. And um, and uh, yeah, you should dump. Don't be afraid to seek help and don't feel weak because you are not alone. And increasingly less alone. You know, 100 years ago was like, or maybe 200,000 years ago, you know, if I've heard this and I don't know if it's true, but I've heard this, that like an amish communities that depression and anxiety is like completely nonexistent.

Speaker 5:          02:04:55       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          02:04:57       No, you know about the amish. The Amish. Yeah. Yeah. And that, that makes sense to me, right? Because they're fully fulfilled. They have very basic, uh, or not basic, but they have very, they know what to expect every day and they're fulfilled every day and their life is, they understand what it is day to day. It's not like you went about how many days do you wake up and you're like, like, fuck, what, what? Like what am I going to do today? Like, you know, anyway, that's it. Meanwhile, Papa's in the backyard.

Speaker 5:          02:05:42       And uh,
