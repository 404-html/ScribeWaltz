Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Welcome

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       to the h three podcast experience. How's that? Pretty good periods. We got super powers over. This is a fucking experience. I don't see Joe Rogan's podcast lighting up with reverb and lightening bolts. No, no, I'm good. Thank you. To Dollar Shave Club and Fort Night for sponsoring this episode of the podcast. Guys. We started late today because my day so far has been pretty messed up. Oh my God, Dude. What happened? So

Speaker 2:          00:00:57       having breakfast this morning, you know, getting ready for the day and um, I see shredder on his little bed next to the breakfast table, a chewing on this weird little blue thing. And I'm like, what the hell is that? What does, what does, what does shutter gotten himself into? And he's like, he's the pickiest eater in the world. He doesn't eat anything but this little thing, of course you eat this. And I pick it up. And what I ended up saying, I thought it was like maybe a piece of detergent or something. But what ended up being was a fricking adderall pill that was covered in plastic and he was like munch like halfway through it. So I'm online looking up like, what is this? I'm like, it's adderall. Who, who the hell left adderall on my floor. So I call the vet, the vet says call poison control, poison control. Well, he's a little guy and the amount that he ate pretty much crosses right over the line of being toxic so to like, you need to take him to the vet immediately and induce vomiting and shoved charcoal down his throat. And I'm looking at this sweet little guy by the way, shredder. Who's the light of my life besides you?

Speaker 2:          00:02:19       Yeah. Whoops. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       and,

Speaker 2:          00:02:27       and I'm like, dude, this guy is going to go through like the craziest day. They're going to go pump his stomach. So I get in the car because he, he seems fine. He just basically ate a bunch of crack, which, what adderall is. So I'm in the car driving on the way to the vet. He seems fine at halfway there he starts shaking and crying and he's confused. He's like panicked and it's apparent that the drug had, had started affecting him. And um, and I'm like crying because I'm so fricking scared. My little guy and isla is out of the country, out of the country with her family. It's A. Anyway, we get to the vet. He's fine. They pumped his stomach. He's fine. He's a sweet little guy. Point is. Sorry I'm late.

Speaker 2:          00:03:14       My little guy almost went though. I don't know if I can handle that. Don't just break you man. Well, he. I was talking to Eli about it and she's like, if anything happened, shredder, I swear to God I. I couldn't handle that. She's like, I couldn't handle it. I know what I do because she's over there to take care of her. Of her father who is sick right now. Woo. Anyway, he's fine. Yay. But who walks around with an adderall and their pocket? Just free flying. Just free flying in the pocket. Any small creature that comes across in the vet said when he puked, they found the pill was blue and they found all these little blue specs like a ton of the drug and his stomach. She said it's a good thing. You brought them right away because he puked it out and he. He, I think he would have died, certainly if I didn't catch him eating it right away, he would have died crazy. So anyway, so that's about that. That's why we're late. I don't know if that was an interesting story, but um, I was, I was very upset, but he's okay now and I'm also, I'm the wizard of loneliness this week because Isla has gone. She's back helping her family and I am truly the wizard of loneliness. Shredder was gone with my parents the other day and I was just sitting there, damn,

Speaker 2:          00:04:40       cast loneliness on myself. Level 90 nine. But anyway, I'm here to entertain and that is what I shall do next. Friday is the great and wonderful Bo Burnham, which were all super excited to meet and chat with him and we're going to talk about his amazing film that's coming up. Very excited about that, but we've got a lot to get to today. We've got the Tan of Khan Khan. It took me a while to wrap my head around the icon thing. This was like a rollercoaster of fraud. The thing about Taneka, and I've seen a lot of people talking about it, the thing that Kinda surprised me most about it, like I'm not a lawyer, I have dealt with a lot of legal stuff though, is that I'm like damn, like they're off being like, yeah, I fucked up, but a lot of people aren't acknowledging that it seems to be criminal fraud, like straight up, like the FBI might want to say what up to her and a couple of weeks from now I want to get into that, but first let's break the ice because I've got to clip. That might be the best thing I've ever seen. I'm just going to pop that up there. Get the mood set, get the feeling right, man. Being in the trenches solo was a fucking brutal dude. But here we go.

Speaker 2:          00:06:02       No sound. There's no sound on this. So this is. There's no sound on this, right, Dan? Yeah, no, no. So basically what you're seeing is there's A. I think they were shoplifting, right? They're shoplifting and they try to escape as a police officer, he brings her to the doubt. He brings her down. They're all kind of having a little orgy there at the entrance, kind of just tussling around, so dude escapes from the police. He's. He's running into the storage, the basically the back area where they store all the Saudi pops. As you can see. Now this video is so perfectly like shot and set up and the twists and turns in it. He's throwing halls at the officer. The officer has a gun pointed at him. What does he do?

Speaker 2:          00:06:49       He armed himself with a bag of halls. Lawson. Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. By the way, these police officer pants are kind of Gucci's. Fuck. They got nice taping men. The leg. It's pretty stylish. How did she escape? This is in Canada by the way, if you need to know if this was an America, they'd be fucking bleeding dead on the floor. It Ganada. This girl's just wandering around. You know what I mean? There's two officers and she's still wandering around the store. Anyway, he's armed. Oh, little taser. They're straight to the floor. Did I miss the bat? The. Oh yeah. Here this motherfucker arms himself with. What does it say? Spritz? They look like a bag of peanuts. Our son. Here you go. If you stay one step closer, mad, I'm going to hit you with this bag of peanuts. His threats sadly did not avail as the officer was, was better armed than him sadly. So he's. He's pretty much in submission, but nope, he got a second wind folks. He's got a second one and his, his, his wife is on the loose and he pushed through it says back the fuck off bitch

Speaker 2:          00:08:08       is what he said now I. Yeah, that, that was a. That was a real spill. I've wondered if this video is fake, but that's spill is real. Folks. Let me tell Ya. That was. Oh, he's got his. He's got his knee right on his fucking dick bone. They're pretty. So the girl has got a. she's like, Yo, listen, the cop just need my boyfriend in the deck. He's probably impotent from now on. So she's like, I don't have any much use for this guy, so I'm out of here.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       Peace.

Speaker 2:          00:08:42       She tries to sneak out and that's true love folks. She's like, he's fucked. I'm out of here.

Speaker 1:          00:08:49       Peace.

Speaker 2:          00:08:51       There's the bag of a spritz that was thrown at the officer. Those already. Those are evidence. Now, exhibit C, did this guy, man, this officer, this is like a real test for him. Like how do you stop a meth head?

Speaker 1:          00:09:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       In Canada it's a lot harder to, to enforce the law when you don't have a gun. You know, if this was America, they would have just executed that guy. He'd be done short video. Kind of sad because instead of having like a wonderful, almost three stooge asked video do enjoy, it would just be like drugged homeless man was shot dead by Florida. Me, you know. But instead we've got this wonderful little and it gets better. Folks. Stay tuned.

Speaker 2:          00:09:43       I love the effort by this officer though. He's like, you will not fucking escape me. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, his, uh, his wife having decided to divorce him is looking for an escape room. She goes to the ceiling, desperation. My God. Now this is like, Dude, how the hell did they capture this so perfectly. That's what makes me suspicious of it being faked. Like even get the ass shot in there and the spandex and not saying that's something that interests me. Just simply stating that it is quite an opportunistic shot. Wow. Where is she? Where did she go? Let's find out having a tussle and then suddenly look who's back. That's right.

Speaker 2:          00:10:30       The girlfriend, she's back. She's back. Ladies and gentlemen. And aren't we so glad that the Canadian police force in this very moment aren't armed and we can enjoy this video she pops back up to. It's just so beautiful. She dude, they must be dragged out of their mind because she just lives like, shrugged it off like it's nothing. Let's get it. Let's get a. let's get a slow. Definitely. Let's go to quarter speed on this one shelly. So as you can see, she's crawling around the attic space trying to look for an hour and um, maybe maybe she had second doubts. Maybe she said, you know what? I do Love A. Oh, you think she was trying to do like an aerial assault? Yeah. Here. Yeah. She's trying to help out but not quite, not quite. There's tennis balls rolling all over the place,

Speaker 2:          00:11:33       man. She was just unharmed. Whatever they're on, I'll have one please Christ. I could use a little invincibility and my life. I could barely go up my stairs in the evening, but be that as it may. She's not wearing shoes either, which I think is interesting to point out. I know she is. Well, she's missing one shoe. She is missing one shoe, which is definitely worth pointing out. I wonder if she's headed on over to the peanut bags to try to defend her boyfriend. Stuck up on ammo stack up on ammo. She's like, listen, I listen. I don't know the guy. I didn't do anything, man.

Speaker 3:          00:12:10       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:12       Okay. And then then, then the real, the real mf or show up and, and put an end to this rodeo. But wasn't that a thrill? Wasn't that a thrill? Ladies and gentlemen. Truly a gift from Canada and I just really want to reflect one more time on an enjoy the fact that they are armed with tasers and not live. Maybe they are, I don't know, but they didn't shoot him. So cheers to that. Yeah. What a thrill. It was a beautiful thing, man. It's like. Do you see what I'm saying though? It's almost so perfectly arranged, right? That, that I'm very. I am so much suspicion, but the way they eat shit, you really can't fake that. Right? Like, like how do you fake that? That's a real spill for Shadi of fake that Shit. She can't. She, she's, she's takes back to school shopping sales very seriously. That face when a, that face when school papers 50 percent off me. Once when school supplies or 50 percent off.

Speaker 3:          00:13:21       No.

Speaker 2:          00:13:24       Let's see. That again. Really can't get enough. So one more for posterity. This is totally me when I see that APM has a special on school supplies. This is me watching that all weekend still cracks. Well, cheers to them. You know what? Nobody was hurt. Nobody was murdered. It was a beautiful. Oh, it's just every once in a while you get a video that's just so, so perfect.

Speaker 3:          00:13:56       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:13:58       All right, well now I got that out of the way. We should move on to the Tan con. Now. I know a lot of you guys probably been following the Tanach on thing. I think a lot of people have talked about it by now, so I don't want to get too much into the nitty gritty. Honestly, what I was trying to do, because I was going through all this information last night and w and the preceding week, we just understand like what the hell happened, so I kind of have things bullet pointed. We've got video clips, I got pictures and I. and I think there's, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, but most, most importantly. Well let's, let's start from the beginning. Okay, let's, let's start here. This is a riveting story by the way. This whole thing is just absolutely fascinating and I haven't seen fascinating on a while and trust me when I say that mean you see fascinating. Fascinating too. That up quick. So she. So tanner was pissed that vidcon heading, given her featured creator badge in previous years, so she wasn't having that. So she decided to start her own convention that was inclusive for everyone. That's what she kept pressing does that it was inclusive for everybody. She sold these vip passes that said featured creators on them. It's like what? Every person there is a feature creator, featured fucking creator actually would actually said, fuck, the actual official name is featured fucking Korean.

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       That is so fucking cool. Um, but it's like, dude, let's be real. She sold 5,000 tickets and they are all featured creators. Let's be real. There's only one featured creator at Tana Con Stamina.

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       She wasn't there apparently. Um, so Tana decides to throw a con to rival vidcon with like 30 to 45 days to plan it. All right, so here, here's the original invite from the production company called good times, which a lot of good info about these boys. But let's start with this welcome creators. We are so thrilled for you to be part of the first ever Taneka on good times as a family that celebrates the online community. We are so honored to be hosting this event. We truly believe that each of you here is equipped, are equipped with so many talents and passions to lead a revolution to one down, Doug, you're, you're charging $65 for a VIP ticket. There's not a revolution through the social media world that foster the vibrant, inclusive and world changing environment. I hate this whole sentiment of like everybody's a featured fucking creator. You're all youtube superstars there. It's actually really exploitive because you know, every kid these days wants more than anything. It'd be a utuber at my con. Everybody's a featured fucking creator for $65. This event is pioneering the change that we are community wish to see in this industry. Oh yeah, we definitely need more, more Tana cons. We strive to make this a community where everybody feels seen, heard, understood, and most importantly included. Don't they understand it? In a world where everybody's included, it's like you don't exist, Tana, when everybody's equal and everyone has the same talents and appeal, it's like you don't exist.

Speaker 2:          00:17:25       It's so disingenuous. Everyone is a featured fucking creator. So with that being said, fuck vidcon. Fuck the current CEO, is this voice working for you? It was a cringy. I mean, it's no more grungier than her boys. That's fact. Everyone who created vidcon and if you want to know why Tannic comp became thing and that's why other love, right? This is a great genesis of like a great mission statement. It's so phony, dude. It's the funniest shit ever. You're all featured creators. I gotta tell you, I, you've got probably noticed we don't really post videos on h three anymore. I just, I'm so like, well, there's a lot of reasons why were were, but one of the big reasons, just like, man, I just, I really just can't watch everything on youtube. It's just, I don't know man. It's all gotten. So Tana, it's like all Tana and people like her. So, um, let me see what we got here.

Speaker 4:          00:18:34       Yes, that's the window. That's the floor.

Speaker 2:          00:18:37       What is this?

Speaker 4:          00:18:41       The dog?

Speaker 2:          00:18:44       I'm not sure what this significant of that one is. What does this stand first of all from Shane's documentary documentaries? A clip of her blog. I think that video is just, for some reason timestamp wrong. Just go to the very beginning of that video and it, it, it's a nice little summary of her, uh, her mission statement,

Speaker 5:          00:19:08       all of the rebels people and all of the unwanted people should host a little meet and greet in Anaheim, California on the same days as a bit gone. I'd love to do it. I would love

Speaker 2:          00:19:21       you all $65 to come to this rebellious little convention of ours, which stick it to them. We'll stick it to those capitalists at Vidcon. It gets so good. So anyway, she's selling. So what she actually pitches is that most of the tickets are going to be free and there's only going to be a few VIP tickets. What is essentially a free event? People who buy VIP tickets get to skip the line. They get three times worth the ticket price and a goody bag. So the VIP tickets were $65. So essentially she's saying the goody bags can be worth about 200 bucks. Okay. So let's go ahead and look through the goody bag that the VIP people get. And guys really stick around here. So this, this was the most prominent, probably the most valuable item. And there went the Fuck I paid $20 for a condom.

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       The condom. Oh yeah. Seventy five guns. Dyslexic. So it looks like a, it's kind of packaged like an after dinner mint. You know, what's the best part about them giving out condoms? Is that everyone? There's 12. That's good. But also imagine actually using this condom and then finding out that it doesn't, it's not a real condom breaks. You know what I mean? Like is there a little disclaimer that's like, this is actually an after dinner mint packaging and not meant to conceal up something as important as a condom. I wonder how many like uh, unplanned births or, or infectious diseases were passed thanks to her Tana condom by the way. And it's so good that like con, the Tan con, it's just like, so good. Anyway, that was the, that was basically the highlight of the good of the $200. Goodie bag. Um, here's a video of a girl on boxing. Her Goodie bag

Speaker 6:          00:21:21       stickers. Kida Kida. Not from family guy. Pete. It's sounds sponsored by Jason Nash. But he's nowhere to be found good princess, but I can't afford that because I wasted my money on a ticket.

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       Love it. They included some broke ass. Gucci Princess, Ninety nine cent like wristband. Like okay. That's so Gucci Princess. Do you think that any of these little girls spending $65 for a vip pass can afford Gucci?

Speaker 1:          00:21:53       Fuck,

Speaker 6:          00:21:58       I don't even know what this is. Cozy free shopping guy.

Speaker 2:          00:22:02       Clearly it's just a bunch of garbage. I mean it's essentially they basically put a bunch of shit in a bag and said, well you throw this out for us. So. But it gets good folks here. Let's, let's keep going. So the day of it's pure chaos outside. Nobody gets into the convention, which turns out to be, by the way, just a Marriott events room that has a maximum capacity of a thousand and the creators can't even get into the room because it's so unsafe because it's so chaotic and uncontrolled outside. Carol, let me give you a view of basically here. Let's see. This doesn't look. So yeah, you can see there's just like a winding. It's like the whole parking lot. I mean, nobody can get inside. No, it's. There's like 4,000 people outside or something like that. Yeah, so the funny part about basically this is that thousands of people are outside. Okay. And they're supposed to be a VIP ticket line for people who got the VIP ticket to skip in front of the free tickets. But everybody out there who's waiting in line for four to six hours in the blazing heat without any food or water being offered, there's actually footage of ambulance and fire trucks coming and rescuing people from getting each stroke. Everybody who's outside is starting to realize

Speaker 2:          00:23:25       they all have a VIP ticket because it was pitched like mostly free and maybe like 300 vip for people who really care and want to make sure they meet everyone. So everybody out there, they're starting realized has a VIP ticket. Um, they start claiming that there was 20,000 people outside. This is the genius that organized the event. This fucking 20 year old. I don't even know what to say about you did. I can't really say anything honestly. Can't say anything, but what do you need to say? What really do you need to say, this is the guy that organized this event. What really do you need to say about a guy like this?

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:24:17       All as Dan affectionately put it, the segway kid, and this is just perfect. This is. This is the guy organizing the event. This fucking guy with a scarf like, oh yeah. Once I put a scarf on, everybody's going to know that this is under control. Except you made a huge mistake. You drove a fucking segway around, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       God,

Speaker 2:          00:24:42       Gee Whiz, man. This is a guy in charge. Something special about the scarf when it's like 95 degrees outside and people are passing out from heat stroke. Yeah, totally. Yeah, exactly. So they start gloating, so it's, it's chaos. It's pandemonium outside. Nobody can get in. People are having heat stroke, you know, and they're start to. Tana starts tweeting Shit like there's 20,000 people outside. We only 5,000 people were to show we're supposed to show up, but there's 20,000, 15,000 unregistered guests showed up to the convention and that's why we have to shut it down here. She says that Bella, Bella and I are coming out to talk to everyone. Everything is fine. Just fire marshal stuff, keeping it safe. Maybe I won't do that voice adding a third day or if worse comes to worse, I will be down to personally refund anyone who still upset, no one expected. 20,000 people in my loves. I love you. So she's just like, Eh, no big deal. 20,000 people showed up. Everyone understands. But the thing is that the police report issued that same day says there was 4,000, four to 5,000 people there at Max,

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       um,

Speaker 2:          00:26:06       four to 5,000 people at Max, which turns out is the exact number of VIP tickets they sold. So literally the same amount of people showed up as bought tickets and they're trying to paint it like 20,000 people showed up and that's why we're shutting it down. But the truth is they oversold the convention with a 1000 seat capacity to 5,000 people. Here's the police report, because Tana and his production company, he kept trying to spin this narrative of like so many people show up. That's why we had to shut it down, so here's the actual official police report. Garden Grove Police Department officers were sent to Marriott suites to assist hotel staff and security with crowd control and dispersal of unruly hotel guests from the hotel property. The tanach con convention was an event hosted by Tannic on company at the Marriott Suites Hotel. The organizing group for Tenneco was a company called good times promotion.

Speaker 2:          00:26:57       Promotions event was scheduled to have meet and greet sessions between youtube celebrities in their fans. There were concert concerts and dj scheduled reform for fans in the bar room starting at one or 10:00 AM. 10 ICAN had sold approximately 40,000 tickets at the time of the event. The skip on down the hotel ballroom where the event was scheduled could hold a maximum of 1000 people. The organized planned the organizers plans to move the crowd in and out of the venue to allow all attendees the opportunity to participate in that. As the crowd moved through the venue, they were herded into the lobby after a short time to allow other fans into the ballroom. People moved into the lobby. We're upset and refuse to leave. As the crowd grew in the lobby, hotel staff and event security, you cannot gain compliance from the fans, so they're like overflowing into the hotel lobby.

Speaker 2:          00:27:51       But essentially what's important is that the police specifically state that there was four to 5,000 people there, approximately 20 officers and several supervisors responded to the scene. Dude wasting the time of like essentially an entire police force to disperse this absolute mess. The police supervisors on scene to estimate the crowd was between four to 5,000 social media sites. Had the crowd was 20,000 and this was not accurate. The police officers were made, were able to disperse the crowd after approximately 60 to 90 minutes. So there you go. The exact amount of people showed up as tickets sold. Uh, who could have predicted? Yeah. Who, who would have ever seen that coming? This is the part. Oh wait, I want to show this one scene. Yeah. This, this is really important seeing here, but this is from Shane's documentary, which he, he did a lot of the leg work on this and it's really good, but this is footage they took while they were planning David their con. So here, listen to this,

Speaker 4:          00:29:01       but obviously I haven't said it 50 to 100 right now. I love that. For us, I kind of just like set no capacity and they're just like, okay, we're going to sell out. We sell now because I feel like there's a chance

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       everything about God, I love that for us. So he's like, the hotel is set at a thousand but I have it set at $5,200 and she bears witness to that and says I love that for us, which is basically conspiracy to commit fraud. But there is straight up just acknowledging that they're overselling the, the event by 40,000 seats. This is the part at the end of Shane's documentary where he's just like, here's the, here's the raw facts. So here you go.

Speaker 7:          00:29:50       So I still had a lot of questions about pretty much everything. So I called Michael and Michael's dad

Speaker 2:          00:29:56       the, uh, is the event organizers. Yeah. The segway kit,

Speaker 7:          00:30:01       that's the official number of VIP tickets sold was 5,108. The number of free tickets was between two and 300

Speaker 2:          00:30:13       clusivity baby. We just think that everybody's a featured fucking creator as long as you pay me $65. I'm surprised 300 people get free tickets.

Speaker 7:          00:30:24       Claims that Tana knew that and that she was lying when she was at. She still says she didn't. The number of security guards, was it never 91. I got ahold of the contract and it said that at most there was 25 security guards kind of put that in perspective for most conventions. It's usually 50 guards per 5,000 people. So this was cut in half. The amount of money spent on security was $60,000. To put that in perspective, the amount of money that they'd gone spend on security is $1,000,000,000. This is the big one. So I got ahold of the contract between the Marriott and good times and the contract stated that there was only going to be 1000 people in Michael signed, not Tana and Michael about this. And they both said that yes, the contract might've said it a thousand dollars, but everybody at Mary I've told them that that was just the safe number in that $5,000. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:18       Okay. That's so stupid. There's, they literally had a room with a max capacity. You, you've worked with like um,

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       with a lot of venues and stuff. If they tell you, oh yeah, they're like, it's a thousand maximum capacity, but that's just no fucking way. Are you kidding me? No Way. No way in hell. That's real. Just also. But that's kind of a big fucking difference from 1000, like maybe 1300 bucks, 100 over maybe. But even then though, they would never, they would, even, if they would like turn a blind eye to it, they would never say that because they're liable like that. That's insane. It's Marriott, it's a huge corporation and not going to be like, oh yeah, 5,000. That's fine, that's the part. It's Mario, it's not some amateurs, small hotel and they don't give a fuck about Tana, you know, like they do. They have events there every day. It's, this is just routine to them and there's just no, there's no way that's real. I mean this, this is the part that really gets like hearing saying the capacity is 1200.

Speaker 7:          00:32:25       Even if there was no issues, no drama, no whatever. It wouldn't have worked. There's no way that 5,000 people could fit there. There is no way that 5,000 people would have had this wasn't gonna work, but what is capacity

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       talk. But obviously I haven't said it. Fifty 200 right now. I love that for us. I also though capacity,

Speaker 2:          00:32:53       why she'd been looking there like a mom, you know, she's 20. That blew me away. She's 20. She looks like she's going on her second marriage already.

Speaker 4:          00:33:06       Just like, okay, we're going to sell out. We sell

Speaker 2:          00:33:09       coked out. She was like rubbing or no, I feel like there's a chance everything about this. So anyway, the thing that that really like just actually irks me about this is that Shane, Shane did an amazing job on this documentary, like showing all this. I mean he did not pull punches, but in a way it is also a way for them to save face and be like, we confronted it, we talked about it, but the truth is they straight up appear to be committing a fraud. They collected like $325,000 from these kids. The convention, by the way, completely shut down like nobody got in. And here's the great part. Nobody's been refunded,

Speaker 2:          00:33:53       nobody's been refunded here. Check out this press release. Apparently this g, the segway kid, the genius in a contract he signed with this startup, a ticketing company said that they will not issue refunds any, any under any condition, and the any refunds would be have to be handled by them directly. It's a great policy. It's fantastic. And then here, if you would, we'll be issuing refunds to make a claim. Please go to good times.live/claims and fill out the form anytime before January fifth. You should expect a refund within the next 30 days. It's like Bro, you gotta you gotta jump through hoops and pray that you get a refund, but the worst part is like a lot of people flew there booked hotel rooms for this and these guys are pretty much committed like a straight up criminal fraud. I would not be surprised if the FBI police come knocking at their door and like a couple of weeks. So I don't know. Yeah, there's no way this is over for them. I don't think so. They're in deep shit. Yeah. There's some great little details here to like the same night that that all went down and the convention was closed and everyone was losing their minds.

Speaker 8:          00:35:16       Walking from venue to venue crying, trying to find something else.

Speaker 1:          00:35:21       Is that the

Speaker 8:          00:35:22       11:00 PM? We're still calling venues. It's 2:00 AM. We're still calling. You know, Martina asked 71 party.

Speaker 2:          00:35:33       Look at this. This is her that evening.

Speaker 9:          00:35:36       Sure. What do you want to do? Do you want to. Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:35:43       thanks for your $65

Speaker 2:          00:35:47       anyway. So why bother? You know, what really shocked me the most, because you know, this girl Bella Thorne that she's friends with, they're both 20 dude. That's more mind blowing than even the fraud itself. Those girls and I, I don't know if this comes off road, it might, but. And they're, those girls have a lot of mileage on them. They're like 20 going on 30, like Holy Shit. And I'm not saying that like Bella Thorne isn't attractive. I'm just saying she needs her oil changed at this point. I'm 20 years old. I think she looks good. She looks good. It just looks like she's. She just washed out of the sea. Tana. Oh my. I don't know. I just shocked that she's 20. I'm not saying that they're ugly or anything. Just God damn. Well that explains a lot about all of this. And I believe, uh, the Michael Kidd, the segway kid. He, he's also 20 or maybe 21. What happened is a bunch of children. Yeah. What happens when a bunch of 20 year old pseudo celebrities try to organize a convention? Here it is. You get a little fraud, a little unplanned pregnancy. A couple of, uh, stds.

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       Have you ever had a condom break on you, Dan? I have actually. Yeah. That's scary. That's a bad feeling. A lot of people are going to be busting through those. Did breaking through a con. It's one of the worst things ever. I remember the first time I had sex and the condom broke the first time. The very first shit. And you're like, oh shit. You're like, this is a good condom. You're like, this is a really good condom. Damn. What's this brand again? Damn baby. What's this brand? Oh, it's a Tan AECON brand. Like, Oh shit. Oh Shit. Do you have to plan B it? Beat it, beat it. The time the condom broke. That was the one time. Yeah. Tana contract probably have included a low plan being her goodie bag just in case I needed a plan B for this convention. Her parents needed a plan B if I'm being honest.

Speaker 2:          00:38:09       Yikes. So anyway, it turns out the con and Tana con as has a double meaning in this casing as both a convention and a literal con. So I have a couple of bonus clips for you guys. There's really nothing to say, but I felt stupid even talking about it. Honestly. It's, it's fascinating in that it was such a train wreck and presumably they put this event together almost without even a thought to what would actually happen the day of, you know what I mean, like so irresponsible that sent 5,000 fucking people and almost a not even like they thought as long as I booked the room, it's like, you know, if you build it, they will come. That was a movie you need. You need another audience out there. Yeah. I don't know. You need. Anyway. It was just like mind numbingly insane. Um, would not be surprised if a week we see some jail time for them. If I'm being. And I'm, and I swear to God, I'm being honest.

Speaker 2:          00:39:17       We're not. Be surprised. Well the big thing is this Michael Guy, at least according to Shane's documentary, he signed on the dotted line for everything. Yeah. But. So He's, he's definitely fucked. The thing is, I think she, that one clip alone proves that she has like a conspiracy to commit fraud. I love that. For us, that is going to play in a courtroom. There's going to be a judge and a jury at watching 10 ago. I love that for us, and then the judge is going to be like, you know what? I love for you five to 10 years. I'm trying to think of a good plan where I'm trying to. You know what I love for you Tana? Sixty five months. One month for every dollar for your VIP ticket. By the way, bonus. In my research I found some. She's either. Why does she exist? Why is she popular? Hey guys, it's Tana. You know what's so stupid about like youtube, like she like they complete. I haven't ran about too, but I don't fucking. I don't give a shit. Why is it that Youtube will not even bat an eye at me or dubs or any of my friends that actually have. I'm not going to say they have talent. They deserve shows. What the fuck is it always Tana and people like her who are actually not only the lowest character, but frankly criminals

Speaker 2:          00:40:45       that, that get youtube red series. Like there was a, um, she was featured in this. Joey got fucking dog at show is so dumb. The haunted house show God. Have you. Have you ever seen anything dahmer? I, I dare you to watch this shit. And A, and in a way youtube is enabling them to, it'd be like, you are stars. So they're running ads for Tanna. I've got this add a bunch of times because she's premiered in the new season of Joe are Cephas fucking shitty house. And it says, do you love Tana? Like Youtube is actually running ads promoting this, this mom. I say, mom, because like I said, it looks like she's going on her second marriage. She looks like a mom that doesn't spend a lot of time with their kids. You know what I mean? She looks like a mom who's out at 3:00 AM, partying and grandma takes care of the kids. You know what I mean? Does she not look like that? They should not look like this. The odometer is just about to hit 100,000,

Speaker 2:          00:42:15       you know, the check engine light is on. So anyway, and somehow I'm unendorsed bubble or like my friends who, who, who I respect to my great content. Probably the best on youtube. They're unendorsed but somehow. But anyway, so I'm, I'm on her vlog channel, right? This is her trailer, Bro. Watch this. This is her trailer watch in a few hours. Hunter and I just took some adderall. No, we did not. Can you not say that? No, I didn't think that's her fucking first message to her fans. This 20 year old with these little girlfriends. Her first thing she wants you to know about her is that she just took drugs illegally. I just took adderall. Can I not say that? She's probably the one that left it on the floor and two boys and shredder. Oh, interesting. She got wind that we were doing this today. Preemptive strike. Let's give Tana a show on youtube. Red called how called how to be damaged goods by the age of 22. Let's, let's give Tana a show a reality show on youtube.

Just like the clip we saw earlier of these Canadian crackheads falling through the roof. There's another great one that I want to throw up here. This Guy Lou Walsh. Okay. You creepy fucking loony tune. This was a clip. I guess it happened several years ago. Lou Welsh from thex factor. I mean we're all talking about like me too and all this shit. Like if you, if you blink, if you blink wrong at a girl, you're going to be deposed.

I've never, I don't know that I can't say I've ever done this. Really? You've never come on. You see that ground in anyway. I think you already went to sleep. You can. You can tell the truth. I've never, I don't. But I'll tell you. Who Does Lou Walsh look at this fucking Sicko

Speaker 6:          00:54:33       got today. She makes now she knows she's. Yeah. It's not the same show that Ryan seacrest was a fuck is wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:54:53       All right, well she's clearly discuss it. She's not kidding around it. How the hell did nothing come from this? Like this clip resurfaced recently of him. Basically, and by the way, why do you have to do it live on television? Is that somehow like the end, the lion's den theory, right? Like safest and in plain sight. Yeah. Maybe the other might be kind of like, who's going to say something? To me that's like the secrets thing too, when he approaches Katy Perry, it's like, why the fuck are you going to make these creepy comments to her right before you come live? Because it's almost like the safest time to do it, right? Because they don't want to, you know, they're going to cause a scene by getting upset by it. You know,

Speaker 6:          00:55:36       it's not embarrassing.

Speaker 2:          00:55:42       What is wrong with you? Like, what is it? It's clearly not sexual satisfication. It really is almost like a power play. Totally. Explain what's going on for the, uh, for the audio listeners. Oh, well, yeah. Oh yeah. Them, they felt while he's sitting on a couch, it during the live broadcast has of the x factor. He's got his hand on the cohost ass. He squeezing it and patting it live on TV. She's getting noticeably irritated. And she finally says, basically, what are you

Speaker 6:          00:56:10       here?

Speaker 2:          00:56:15       I still have a job. Like that's a creepy shit I ever seen him. By the way, why is this guy looked like a fucking baby bites his face looked like a little child that never aged. Just be like his skin degenerated like he aged, but he never grew up. That's you, Lou Walsh. Shitload of Botox, right? Probably a lot of children's for skin. You know, they say children's for skin is the most regenerative. A potent, you know, cosmetic. He probably. They say that. Actually I'm not. I'm not kidding that shit. No, I swear to God, but I'll tell you. Lou Walsh, this is a powerful man. He's got a lot of money. He's got the. He's got the literal face of a child. You probably has baby for skin factory. You know how they like a farm silk. This guy farms for skinny. He's probably got babies on chains and he and they've got super regenerative for skin.

Speaker 2:          00:57:08       They're like a new breed. And they got super regenerative for skin that he just snips and rubs. He actually what? He rubs his shoe. The shoe magma, not actually the force can buttons. This magma is the residue and dirt that collects when you don't clean inside the force gun. The other problem I have because I'm Jewish, but he probably does rub that magma oliver his fucking face and that's why it looks like that. That's why it looks like a 50 year old gerber baby. I always hated that guy's face added even more know what a piece of shit and he's like, he's doing the groping and then like the moment where she finally reacts. He's just like jiggling it. Like he's just like, it's a man's world baby. Why is this guy still have a job? That's my question because I found this clip and it just resurface.

Speaker 2:          00:57:58       I was like, Holy Shit, this is like really bad and I'm looking at. I'm looking and I'm trying to find any evidence of, of him being reprimanded for this and there's nothing there. Nothing happened. Nothing. We need to. We need to go to his home. When he to look in his basement, you know that there's like giant bottles of milk and these super regenerative force can babies in his basement. He selling these two Chinese patrons, they used them as Viagra. The Chinese will do anything to help stimulate their sex and you know I'm right. All the fuckers straight up kill endangered species, Rhino Horn baby to to help get their dick hard. It doesn't work by the way, but they still kill them all and I'm sure you tried it until you try it. I Rhino Horn. Well, as far as I can tell, there is no medical value and ground up toenails, which is basically what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:58:54       But I love that. The Chinese to go on a little tangent, it's like you know that there's Viagara right? You don't have to go fucking kill endangered species anymore. And Lou Walsh, it's time to just age with grace and shut down the baby force can factory. This guy pisses me off, man. It's pretty gross. When was this? This is like some, you know that scarf. You seen his vest pocket. That's his fucking jerk off rag. He's such a Weirdo. He probably goes to the bathroom during the break. Jerks and do is rack, puts it back in his pocket. He probably does weird shit like makes her smell it without telling her. He goes eight falls out of his bag. He's like, oh, can you pick that up for me? Because he gets off and knowing that she touched his comrades. Jesus Christ, man. He's a Sicko. It's not man.

Speaker 2:          00:59:44       Fuck this guy. Fuck this guy. Yeah, I guess this was. This is pretty. Pretty Harvey. Pretty hard to get away with this. We're in a post harvey world and I just saw this video man and I gotTa tell you I did not like it. This is the same show that like. See Chris Scott and we're in. We're in trouble over though, right? Without America. No, that's all circling around. Simon. Cow Cow. He is the epicenter. Simon cows up to some weird shit. By the way, baby for screen is just the beginning with Simon cowl. That's just the tip of the Dick.

Speaker 2:          01:00:23       Simon cow. What does he do? You know? These rich billionaires have the most fucking twisted like fetishes because like nothing gets you off at that level of wealth and power. What does Simon callow get off on? [inaudible]? I'd like to know. He just beats people to death for sport. He just grinds up bodies and then puts them into a sausage tubing and fucks himself with it. That's vulgar. Jesus. Yeah. Maybe that's all right. Let's move on. We dissect it. I think that's accurate though. Just for the record. Look at his face. I wouldn't be surprised if he shoving, you know, body parts of his ass. What else would get along? I get him off. Does he react at all during this clip?

Speaker 6:          01:01:09       What is his reaction to. I think he looks disgusted. Oh, I don't know that he saw necessarily. Right? Like I don't. I don't. I don't think he necessarily knows everyone's joking around because they didn't see how free that's going to be really frustrated for

Speaker 2:          01:01:31       her. It takes a lot of courage to on live TV and be like, hold on. Oh yeah, fuck yeah. And nobody saw what happened. So it's hard to be supportive of her right in that moment that the on the couch don't necessarily see how severe it is. Just God bless her, you know, and God bless her. That's all I can say. All right, fuck no, that's moving on. She does spice girl in my heart. She's got a lot of spice and she has a spice girl. It's confirmed, confirmed spice girl there. So, um, we announced a giveaway last week for the way a lot of people submitted songs about Ian. The end turn. We got a lot of great submissions, but there was one that really rised above a. Oh shit. I have to play it. God dammit. Can you play it? Yeah, actually I got it ready.

Speaker 2:          01:02:21       Hold on. So there was one song that really rised above made by Jan occasion. It's a beautiful little diddy that expresses my inner feelings on the Internet. Sometimes he's, he, you know, he's there and he tries his best, but goddammit. And so God, goddammit, Cajun Cajun, and I'm giving you what are you giving them? Beautiful s nine plus. Oh boy, this is the best phone on the market folks. And let me tell you what, I got a special twist open. I got a special little incentive. Goddammit, didn't you weren't supposed to procreate.

Speaker 2:          01:03:23       Comes with my DNA. Cajun Cajun grants. You can you comes with my kiss marks and my DNA. So that's going out to the Cajun Cajun. And there's another person I want to give an award on, a phone to my favorite phone on the market. By the way, Samsung has graciously supported us. They've given us what they send us. 10 of these 10, something like that. Look at you. Notice this fucking beautiful new TV. Samsung's hooking it up and supporting us, which is great because they're pacing my favorite tech company. Um, we're going to keep giving these away. What is this like a thousand dollar phone given that. So what's, what's the retail value? Let's look it up a lot. Samsung Galaxy, so I am going to give away another phone to this. This one guy, he submitted a prank call that he made with my voice. He called a health food store and he made a soundboard of my voice when I was talking about Keto Diet and the call is pretty good.

Speaker 2:          01:04:19       It's not like genius, but I love that he created this really specific soundboard of me talking about Keto and my hope is that by. I want to watch with you guys. It's a lot of fun. I want more shit from you guys. I want soundboards. I prank calls. I want parody songs. I want everything cool. Send it goddammit to podcast@hthreehthreeproductions.com. We're going to show it. We're going to credit you and our favorite ones, our favorite ones are getting hooked up with my DNA. That's also on an SDM plus. You can choose to not have DNA, but I think most of you are going to want some of my baby for skin. I am one of the super regenerative babies. Magic being a baby with Super Regena to for skin DELAC escapes the factory, but you're forced can keeps fucking growing like it never stopped. So wow.

Speaker 2:          01:05:15       You have to cut it like toenails. You have to keep it on a monthly basis. It's a monthly breast. Yeah. Did you know, and this just occurred to me and I think it's worth sharing and this is real, that in Israel, the very religious Jews have when they have brisses and please, I'm not kidding, the rabbis know where this is going to suck the baby's fucking Dick. They cut the force going off and then the rabbis suck the blood out of his newly freshed fucking dig hygienic and a lot of the times these nasty old fucks have like herpes and they'll give the fucking room what? These guys are so insane. These ultra religious guys, like they tried to outline that, that practice in Israel recently, but it didn't pass because they're like, listen, if I want to suck a baby's Dick, who are you to tell me now? I wonder if he's trying to suck the regenerative for you know, stem cells. Maybe. Maybe. Imagine, imagine for a second damn, putting a baby's bleeding dick in your mouth. I'm not going to imagine that.

Speaker 2:          01:06:31       Just imagine being that guy. What the fuck man out here it goes. Here it goes. Nothing. Imagine being. That guy is insane. These religious guys, I'm telling you, man, they're from another planet entirely. These, these same cookie fucks. There's some, a Jewish holiday where they grab a chicken and fucking spin it around over their fucking heads until it like shit's everywhere and it's just sprang shit everywhere. And then when they're done, they go suck a baby's bleeding thick. These are the French, by the way. This is not right. This is like they're out there. Yeah. It's basically like the Judaism version of like the um, what those limit ticks that like always causing a scene at like, uh, oh, uh, the funerals in the Baptist church. Just like, Bro. Yeah. Westborough. I can see them. I like to see them square off the insane, insane battle.

Speaker 2:          01:07:43       I think I got to be frank. I think the Jews in this case, when you think so well, they got the vitality from the baby for skin, so it's hard to top sucking a baby's bleeding. Dick can't really top that and I and I feel bad even saying it. Folks, can I call you folks anyway? Let's play the song. So the prank song by are the prank call by. Sound mastered. Tony, go ahead and roll it down so I'm must have. Totally. Here we go. Turn it up. Excuse me. Can you help me with something? Sure. Can you be kind and take the time to help me out? What are you showing visually right now? Your beautiful face. That's going to be awkward. What you want? I guess I don't know, but I can just sit here for two minutes and it's just showing them. Feel like. Just go wide. I like that. Yeah. People love that shit. Internalized depression. Face here. I'm going to play it on my computer.

Speaker 2:          01:08:41       Excuse me. Can you help me with something? Sure. Can you be kind and take time out of your day to help me?

Speaker 11:         01:08:47       How can I help you?

Speaker 2:          01:08:48       I'm going to be fully honest. I don't understand the Keto Diet.

Speaker 11:         01:08:51       Uh, well, the Keto Diet is, you know, it's like, have you heard of the, a axis diet? Yes. Okay. So it's going to be somewhat similar. You have to be in the same pattern of what it is that they need you to do and then they have their products that you can, that will help you lose weight.

Speaker 2:          01:09:13       This whole thing of like don't eat fruit just seems fishy to me.

Speaker 11:         01:09:16       Oh, maybe I'm around. Yeah. No, you know, it's Kinda like you just eat a lot of bacon and, and meet, you know, nothing else. So, okay.

Speaker 2:          01:09:28       For breakfast, eat eggs and cheese and bacon deep fried and covered

Speaker 11:         01:09:33       canola oil.

Speaker 2:          01:09:36       Dramatica. She doesn't bat an eye. She's like, Yep, that's the dying your hair

Speaker 11:         01:09:41       that on that guy at a. I would recommend talking with him. He'll be back in the store on.

Speaker 2:          01:09:47       Do you feel like people hate fat people know at the grocery store their sugar and fucking everything?

Speaker 11:         01:09:57       Well that, that, that there is,

Speaker 2:          01:09:58       it's so easy for skinny people like you. I crave and desire hamburgers and pizza.

Speaker 11:         01:10:04       Hm. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:10:06       is it an issue of self control?

Speaker 11:         01:10:09       Yes, it is.

Speaker 2:          01:10:10       I've always known that about fat and skinny at the same time.

Speaker 11:         01:10:13       Huh?

Speaker 2:          01:10:14       I'm healthy at 400 pounds.

Speaker 11:         01:10:17       Well, but if you'd like to talk, you know, talk more with John about that diet. You're more than welcome to call back on Friday.

Speaker 2:          01:10:23       I used to be fit. Okay. Are you actively still on the decline? Weight Wise?

Speaker 11:         01:10:28       Uh, are you asking me personally? Yes. Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:10:34       Yeah. Is this going? I don't remember if it goes anywhere. I mean there's, there's not a climax necessarily, so you guys get the idea. It's not a genius prank call, but I love that he, he sound boarded this Keto thing and call it, love it. I want your guys stop. Help me be funnier. I'm not funny. I don't have the time to make segments. You make segments for us. That's what I love. Genius. And frankly, if you guys have a funny prank call or maybe if it's neither unrelated to me necessarily, we want to hear it and if it's funny we're going to use it and we're going to you a fricking phone. Not a bad deal. So I looked it up. It's about 950 bucks. Whoa. Whoa. You can Ebay. I won't judge you. You're not gonna want to though once you open it up obviously.

Speaker 2:          01:11:29       Alright, we're alright. Come on. Oh, here's a good one. This is a good one. You guys. Ty Lopez. Friend of the show. But I mean let's do this. Let's be honest. Well I've, I've said many, many harsh things about the lead throughout the years, but I just love this Tai Lopez. He's been doing these live streams and he's so cocky about it because he's live. He's like, yeah, I can handle anything. Give me a call. And so he's giving these, these lessons on real estate and someone calls in and basically calls them out and shuts down. Tie live on stream. Let's enjoy

Speaker 7:          01:12:11       alive. What's up youtube? We're doing a live debate. I'm curious. I'm actually curious about your real estate jobs. All right, so give me the formula for a cap rate. Can you define what a cap rate is? So real. Let's talk about real estate for a second. Let's. No, no, no, no, no, no. The find the formula of the cap rate. Do you know what a cap rate is? Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          01:12:31       He's like immediately trying to deflect and for once this guy really hold them to it. I don't know what the fuck it is, but I assume it's probably some elementary thing that if you know anything about real estate, you should know what this is. That's what I assume you crediting the channel. Dan. This was made by Evan. Judge put together by

Speaker 7:          01:12:54       Capri. It's like Roi and the stock market. They call it cap rate. It's very similar formula or a Capri. All right, John, can I say one thing about real estate? You cannot teach a real estate course and I love you bro.

Speaker 2:          01:13:08       Look at his face. You can see that humiliation. His eyes are squinted. He's just like, Damn. All the slickness in the world die. You've got your. You understand Thai that your laptop is on two books about Mark Twain and economics on the bottom. You really think you want me to believe that you've read all three of those books, tie volume one and two. The autobiography of Mark Twain tells me one was Mark Twain born tie, and then he goes, let me tell you about Mark Twain. Let's talk about huck Finn for a second. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 7:          01:13:47       Jon, Jon, but you cannot take a real estate course if you can't tell me the formula of account teacher who teaches my real estate course. John, I don't know. Oh, sorry. You don't know. I don't teach my real estate course. I interviewed the top real estate investors that I know real estate after you get started.

Speaker 3:          01:14:17       Ty is honestly and as a, as a guy,

Speaker 2:          01:14:22       the honestly the master of bullshit. What the fuck you want me to get that out of there real quick? He is the master of bullshit. That was good, man. They held his feet to the fire and they got them good. Yup. I want to get him on here. I'm going to call tie and say. Tell me about Mark Twain backed from the two volumes of Mark Twain's autobiography. Tie. Give me a freaking break. I love Mark Twain. I wouldn't read that shit, but that's just me. Alright. Let's get to the putting the pudding pie. We've got a key lime pie. It's fresh. It's right. I would say maybe an American Apple Pie. Warm out of the oven. Good enough to put your Dick in.

Speaker 2:          01:15:09       Apple Pie. American pie. I'm KSI versus Logan Paul. Now I will say this. I actually like Ksi. I don't really have a problem with this for you guys who don't know Logan. Paul and everyone knows the Logan Paul's case size sides a really big. He was Scott, big plank FIFA, but he's kind of like the English pewdie pie in a way. He kind of just makes videos about whatever. He's very popular. And um, he recently had a boxing match with another person who we won. And now there's this whole big thing about case I boxing logan. Paul. My favorite part about this. It's such a circus. I'm telling you, I can't be on youtube. It's, this is what it's devolved into. There's nothing genuine left with very few channels of a genuine left. Um, it's very. Anyway, Ksi little brother comedy, shorts, Gamer, and the undercard is boxing logan. Paul's little brother Jake Paul. Also a friend of the show also show. So I don't, I don't have a problem. I actually liked those guys, but this whole thing, it was just such a circus. Like let me show you. They haven't fought yet, but here's the press conference from, from the event. What are you going to do with. I don't actually

Speaker 12:         01:16:41       volume on the youtube a little bit. Do you don't have one idea that is going to set up his camera. I've got something familiar.

Speaker 2:          01:17:03       Logan. Paul, you're. Who are you like one? You're Mr. suicide prevention and now you're Mr. sit your ass bitch. Sit your ass down. Bitch. The great white hope. Just a white boy from Ohio. I don't know what that means. There was a movie called that. I don't. I don't know if I just made some racial implications. So strike that from the record,

Speaker 1:          01:17:32       but

Speaker 2:          01:17:34       it's like, who are you guys? Look at Logan and Jake Paul. Like, who the fuck are you? There's nothing genuine about these people. They're flying in the wind. They don't know who they are. These are the people that youtube selects to promote and highlight and endorse and I don't know what it is by nature. It's almost like survival of the fittest on Youtube. It's like you have to be this inauthentic, a oil slick. The floats in the water to rise to the top is very rare. Very few exceptions have youtube channels that actually rise above,

Speaker 1:          01:18:12       um,

Speaker 2:          01:18:13       and, and find success that are not this.

Speaker 12:         01:18:17       What the fuck is he saying, Hey,

Speaker 2:          01:18:27       let me say this, I'll just, I'll keep this running because I really don't even care what they're saying. It's so obvious that they're pretending to play a role. Right? I want to even be surprised from being honest. If these guys talked regularly on the phone, 100 percent just colluding, you know, to make this the biggest event ever because their whole thing is like, this is going to be make rager averse. Mayfield bigger. That's how they're presenting it. This is crazier. I bet you these guys talk on the phone and they just jerk off about how much money they're gonna make and on one hand I have to respect the brilliance of like doing a boxing match. I think it is somewhat of a brilliant move, but it's like Logan, you're not like, who the fuck are you dude? Are you the lovable child entertainer? Who cares about suicide prevention

Speaker 1:          01:19:21       or

Speaker 2:          01:19:23       are you a fucking. I don't even know what he looks like. He looks like

Speaker 2:          01:19:29       he looks like a door to door salesman who's going bald at early age. You know, and this is, this is the moment they live for where everybody's rushing on stage. You can't believe it. Oh, the tensions are high. These two guys are going to kill each other. They really, truly, genuinely hate each other. They're all meanwhile like fast forward to this morning at 8:00 AM. They're both on this on like the toilet. Amen. It's going to be great. Just got to really get the energy. We got a rush each other. It's going to be cool. Everyone's going to get freaked out. You want to play smash tonight. They're like best friends. Um, I don't know. This whole thing is so transparent. Who would you, uh, could you box the hood I box like. Yeah, because it's this whole thing with like youtube or xbox boxing each other. Who's your matcha box? Um,

Speaker 2:          01:20:35       I would box. Um, what's this? There's this toy channel with this little kid. It's really a toy channel. Like little kid. No, there's really popular one. Hold on a toy channel. Youtube. It's a kid. I imagine most of them aren't, right? Maybe not actually. I don't know. Uh, it's like Jay's toys or some shit. Everybody knows what I'm talking about. Anyway, there's this toy channel. They get like 300 million views a month. It's just a little eight year old kid. I would fucking beat the shit for all the toys, baby. I can't beat up anybody and I fully acknowledge that. You know what I mean? Sorry, I am. I wonder, I wonder how I would do in a fight like today, like as a, as an adult. I don't know. I get my ass beat. Probably ever know. Fight grown up. Yeah. But it's like you're a kid, you're like major, you know, resilient. I don't know. Yeah. Beat the a kid. I mean, most definitely. I set it up. I think I could take Jimmy Lee. Ooh, I pay for that. What do you mean Roy? Somebody just said Roy in our chat. Roy. I said, Roy, who's Roy? Uh, you. Who is watching? I think this is the toy channel. Roy Roy. It's not Roy. She's helped [inaudible] was trying to set up this match between me and the angel. He was doing work for me. It was a chamfer standing up. It's going to be so late. Oh, Ryan Ryan's toy review. Ryan's toy review. Brian, I am coming for you and I'm fucking pissed

Speaker 2:          01:22:33       it's going down. Um, what's an adult I could take? Danny Devito. Jimmy Lee, for sure. I feel like I could take peewee Herman, but he's a little crazy. He's old though. He's Wiley. Wiley. Wiley. I don't think there's not, there's not many even feels bad. But you actually gave me the clue. I type Roy toys and it said Ryan. So either you're on top of it tonight. Oh God. Who could I anyway, let's focus enough about me. Um,

Speaker 10:         01:23:16       right. I'm going to come out. I'm going to do this whole bit making fun of the Japanese, the suicide forest, and, and rushed me. Notice when he, then, when they rushed each other, by the way that he never actually throws a punch. They just like collide and then everyone charges in to do like this iconic, like, no, they went there. No, break it up. Break it up. Hold on. There's this one where they rushed the stage. I have to find this. Maybe we missed it already. It's here. It's, what the fuck is he doing? I look at, this was the Nazi salute. You see how uh, you see. Okay. So I charged them but doesn't actually throw up. It's like, what are you intending to do your bit?

Speaker 2:          01:24:03       You're going to be bald in two years. Logan. Imagine Logan Paul Bald and like a Lamborghini, like, bawled, like bawled, like not even like bristles a baby. I prefer the horseshoe. Look. Honestly, the, the old monastery left. Imagine Logan Paul Balding sitting on a wagon cooking meat. Like a monk. That's where it should be. You still have that image in a robe with a with, with like, you know, controlling the horse. That's Logan. Paul. It's a fucking monk. Anyway, it's just self address. I'm sorry. I think it's so funny. I don't think there's anything genuine. I don't think they. You know, and then here's the thing. They're not. They want to bring 20,000 people into an auditorium. It's like, Bro, this is going to be guaranteed the least entertaining boxing match ever. These are two youtubers, not trained professional fighters. Nobody's going to get knocked out. It's going to go the full distance of the five because none of them have the capacity or the physical ability to knock each other out.

Speaker 2:          01:25:16       They're going to get tired after two rounds. There's gonna. It's just gonna be a bunch of tired ass dudes throwing punches at each other. It's going to end in a judge decision and honestly you could go either way because who fucking cares at that point because you paid hundreds of dollars to watch essentially to untrained fighters, a throat wet noodles at each other, which is basically all they're going to be throwing after two rounds. You think? I mean this is like you pointed out, this is obviously stage. Do you think the fight is going to be genuine in any way or is it like wrestling and it's pretty good? I think it'll be real because they both want to win. Sure. But I don't think either of them can knock each other out. I don't. I really genuinely don't know they're doing this twice. There's like another fight date in January.

Speaker 2:          01:26:01       Yeah, one of the first in the UK, but then they're doing a us one. We should go. No, I hear you. But I also think a lot of people are going to do that. I mean maybe it could be. You know, it would be fun. I've been wanting to plan a man on the street segment. Maybe I've been wanting to do something with Joey Salads for some reason where I sent him like man on the street, so or maybe not even joe sells, but maybe someone we actually respect to go create a segment, you know, and play it on the podcast. I mean, Shit Dude, I think that's a great idea. And Ian, you down, you're down to go to the UK to go watch a kids eye versus logan? No, he's in La. I thought. No, I think. Well the first one is in the UK. Okay. Oh that makes sense. I was wondering whether they're going to do it in the UK because l okay. That, that's interesting. August 25th in the UK. Second fight is scheduled for February 20, 19 in an undecided venue in the US. Probably La Logan. Paul is basically, he's fallen from grace. I don't think he's selling maverick. Merge his vlogs on getting that many views. Did it about a $7,000,000 house. You know, the property tax on $7,000,000 house. I mean you're looking at well to one percent, so it's.

Speaker 2:          01:27:13       Is that $70,000 a year every year forever. I'm sure that youtube money we'll keep rolling in, right? Yeah, probably but like to an extent, but I mean when he bought that house he was at his peak. Yeah. And now we'll look what he's doing now. I'm sure he's going to get paid handsomely, but the thing is, I haven't watched other people's reaction to this, but hopefully they also don't get taken in with like there's a lot of details of like, look, when a look when Ksi told comedy shorts Gamer to chill, look at all these details. Oh look what that means. It's all a bunch of fucking bullshit. Look in the crowd by the way. All these kids. All right. I've talked enough about this. Honestly, I'm boring myself, but there was one funny detail. It's like, wow, they're, they're selling out this arena. It's the biggest sporting arena and Europe apparently I read and I was like, wow, I wonder. I wonder how they're the ticket sales are because the fight is coming up pretty soon. So I'm go to the seating plan

Speaker 2:          01:28:22       and I'm like, Holy Shit. There's a lot of fucking seats. Do I scroll down here? So these were never opened. These are closed and these are, there's a lot of seats available. You know like these, these are quite possibly we're never opened. I just looked it up with 21,000. Is the capacity of that arena. It doesn't even look like they're at half of that. Yeah, I don't think so. I mean it's not, it isn't that far off next month I guess. Yeah. I mean you don't, you don't. The ticket sales don't go up. Right, right. What I'm going to be looking at when I watched that is I want to see the seats. I want to see. Well what usually what they do is they'll like, they'll try to fill the, pack it all in where the camera's consumed for sure. Like all these like ring side seem filled. But what is that like 2000 at most? Probably not even that. Maybe a thousand. That's crazy. Ringside seats man. It was funny but apparently yeah. Apparently it's like $600 for a ringside seat. Not Worth it. Sorry. And that's not my budget. Let me see, ticket prices and who fucking cares. I mean, seriously, who gives a shit? So I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:29:43       That's what I have to say about that. There you go. There it is. Just like forrest gump and that's what I have to say about that. But nobody's clapping for me.

Speaker 3:          01:29:56       I got you. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          01:30:02       At least one person on youtube is genuine. Thank you. I deserve that. Um, last week we spoke about Metamucil, which is what, Chris, this is what everyone has been waiting for. Really? Oh yeah. It's 30,000 people watching right now. Everybody's saying for this. It was waiting for this. So it was recommended to me. Um, and I bought it.

Speaker 2:          01:30:38       It's kind of expensive by the way. It was like 25 bucks for like 300 capsules. And when you get the bottle it says take five a day. It's like these huge pills. Oh, Jesus. Okay. Five a day. Yeah. It was like damn. But then I was like, I'm not taking five. They'll not like a horse. It's like a huge pill of like wheat, like, yeah, of course it's going to clean my bowels. Why don't I just eat a banana at that point? Well, I'd rather you'd have banana. Anyway. I take two pills and this is a night where I'm going out to a party and for dinner I have pizza and I have alcohol now for any mortal man, any one of us, this would result an absolute catastrophe. Total. A wasteland. Okay. Of the anus and asshole area. Frankly. Sometimes I should. So disgusting.

Speaker 2:          01:31:29       When I have diarrhea, it sprays on my thighs and I'm not going to lie. Sometimes it happens sometimes. I mean sometimes you blast and it really hits the side of the road. The deflection, ice. I just thought you were like a shotgun blast and it was just, you know, it's a buck shot at sometimes you. Sometimes I'll be sad when I have a meal like this. You're wiping as I do this way. Don't fucking hate on me. There were met by the way. Ian fessed up. He's a front. He's a at the front. When, when you guys were arguing about it on air. Ian and I were arguing about it back here. You know, I got to say too, I was curious that night I went home and I tried it your way and I gotta say it's inferior. It's not a fear. You are not used to it. If I tried it your way wouldn't respond. I have years, decades of experience wiping it's muscle memory. Dan. Yet will you. What do you expect to go home and just live? Live one evening in my asshole. And you think that's, that's Dan. You, you don't know what you're talking about is I should give it another shot and fret. And frankly I'm, I'm in the middle of something, right? I'm talking about my shotgun. Diarrhea. So the verdict is still out. So

Speaker 2:          01:32:47       you ever have a shit so nasty like you wipe and then you're like, I better check my thighs and cheeks just to be safe. Sometimes. That's reality for me. And this was one of those meals. So I take these pills. I took two of them, not five before I go out because when I'm have fucking human garbage disposal, what am I taking five? It's a little ridiculous and I have to say it the next morning I had the shit just slid out of my asshole with elegance and grace and a supple, a supple glide almost as if to say, hey, you know, it's going to be okay. Wow. And uh, and I went to wipe and I wasn't a oneweb. There was, it was some, but not a lot. I would say it was a three way. I don't necessarily have the courage not to end with a wetland. I ended wet cause I mean, that's just part of who I am, but I was, I was shocked. I was absolutely shocked by that first day result I was blown away. But since then I've been taking it every day with my meal and I have to say I'm not, I'm still not totally sold because

Speaker 2:          01:34:04       it's, it's, it's a weird thing, like it's like greases your shit. It like slides out of your asshole, like somebody sprayed, you know, spent like a pam on your anus is like, it's just, it's, it's not, it's like a, it's like your anus. It's like your intestines is made of Teflon and it's kind of a strange phenomenon in front being honest. It just slides right out. Wow. I wasn't curious before, but now that you've explained the CRESCO ass. No, I swear to God if you. If you try these, you will experience a difference in and bowel movements so it on the bottle it says it can take up to seven days for your body to adjust to actually getting fiber for the first time in its life. So I mean I'm enjoying, I'm enjoying it so far and I'm going to. I'm going to keep reporting back but it's real interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:34:59       But it's a mixed bag. You're saying like if it's not off a little bit after that initial. No, no, it's been pretty good. It's good. It hasn't gotten better because I was like wow, I had pizza and alcohol and my shit was this clean, but I've had good days and my shit wasn't better than that. You know what I mean? Which was what I was expecting. So I'll, I'll, I'll keep. I'm going to keep taking it. Like, I mean I enjoy it. I enjoy having my, my asshole basically, you know, like a, like a slip and slide essentially, you know, the slip inside. But do you know the ones where you hit the end and then you splash up and splash out lamp? It's got like an alligator's head. It's like that.

Speaker 2:          01:35:50       So I like it. Alright, I'm going to have to give it a shot. I'm going to sell so much of these fucking metamucil is man. Where's my sponsor? This up bear or whoever it is. Um, because I'm away. I wrote a song for Ila. Me and my friends wrote a song for you since she's gone and I'm the wizard of loneliness as I've previously coined. Um, we'll get to that at the end. But let's see, I've got the WOMP womp clip. Let me, let me play this real fast because I love it so much. I mean, look, I read today I don't, I don't like to talk about politics that much these days, but oh my God, this is, this is special folks. This is this a special. Let me look. I read today about a 10 year old girl with Down's syndrome who was taken from her mother and put in a cage. I wrote about a try. I read of a of a girl with down syndrome being put in a cage. WOMP womp. She's so fucking priceless. Crazy. It's just so bright girl with Down's syndrome who was taken from her mother and put in a cage. I wrote about a. Did you say down syndrome?

Speaker 2:          01:37:09       That's what he said. Politics is such a shit show. I love it. It's such a circus. This is basically comparable to Ksi verse Logan Paul Right now, except with like little little kids. Did you just say, womp womp, bet your fucking ass. I won't bump to. And that little girl with down syndrome. So unabashed about just taken from her mother. Didn't put in a cage. I wrote about a. God bless him. Dan had a funny note about this. He said, this is Corey Lewandowski. Ruined Down Lewandowski are, or as you might say, Luhan against down skews. Might not hurt. That's true. That's too good. Well done. Well done. Corey Lewin against down skis.

Speaker 2:          01:37:59       It was trump's 2016 campaign manager until he was replaced by Paul Manafort who is currently in jail. So this is a, this is a winning winners. And this is a office you want to hold. Lewin Lewin against. Downscale. Refused to apologize for the remark when asked about it on Fox News. WOMP womp. I just, it cracked me up. I was just like, whoa. He womp womp to fucking down syndrome, baby. Crazy. Really? This, I've got this. I've got this Jimmy Lee clip. Um, I guess I might throw it on. And then I want to play this song for all you guys. I got a song please. I want you to watch it. So don't go away. This is very important to me and to my friends who wrote it with me and to Isla and to shredder who almost died today. Maybe I should just play it. Well, this is going to take us out, right?

Speaker 2:          01:38:59       Do we need to say goodbye now? I'm gonna. Watch Jimmy Lee. Oh Shit. Hang on. There's really not much to say about our old friend Jimmy Lee is up to some antics that I find pretty funny. Um, what are the numbers that, how are we doing? Doing good. 20, 29, 29 point five. Nice. Welcome everybody. Thanks for tuning in. God bless you. Appreciate you so very much. A Jimmy Lee, the Jersey outlaw. He's still at it. He's dangerously funny. Do you remember Jimmy Lee? Probably. He's like this incredibly racist, abrasive unfunny. Just really a character and the worst way possible. We had him as a guest. It was one of the worst episodes we had as mad as a guest and after our first break, me Dan and Isla were huddled in the corner. He was outside and we're like, did we can't, this can't go on. We have to end this.

Speaker 2:          01:39:56       So we actually gave them the, the, the cartoon came off the stage. It's frankly, it's our fault. I think that we should have anticipated that this would have. It was a formative experience for us. We didn't really know what we were doing at the time, but it's fine. It was, it was early days, but anyway, he started view body. He doesn't actually, I'm having an engaged audience, but this video has one point, 2 million views, 94 comments and 900 likes. So he started view bonding, which I find pretty, pretty terrific. Once sick of the comments, Jimmy, you're my father. I don't think a youtube video has ever made me laugh so hard. Oh, cheers to you about literally couldn't finish this one, made it halfway and stopped too cringey. Well, anyway, let's, let's give you a taste of this viral hit God, Jesus Christ. And you mixed your fucking audio right? So the video starts while you watch for yourself. The video starts with five seconds for the video. Begins with them having crowds of people pretending to know who he is, which is a phenomenon I've noticed, you know, spring in his videos. It's a part of his plan to view, but I guess is that he's, he's building this great story about himself. He's got security guards,

Speaker 7:          01:41:25       perfect. Say Dangerous, really funny or comedy reality show on television. It hits three, 2018, by the way,

Speaker 7:          01:41:49       Yeah, that's a lot of enthusiasm and he got it from them.

Speaker 2:          01:41:59       What are you, the president? You've got like secret service with air pieces and shit and I can't watch this. I really. It's so painful. I just thought it was funny. I thought it was like Damn Jimmy. Still trying to. In a way, you've got to give it up till till Jimmy like, you know what? Let's watch a clip. Let me. Don't cut them off. Let's do it. Let's see. Some of his comedy or weekly. How often were you brought up?

Speaker 2:          01:42:36       You're wanting to talk to Jimmy.

Speaker 7:          01:42:39       Oh, just what happens when your parents beat you up as a kid.

Speaker 2:          01:42:46       He's like, am I right to the guy?

Speaker 7:          01:42:51       So let me ask you something. Urban Cowboy. Brett, zoom in. Zoom in.

Speaker 2:          01:42:56       No, no, no, no. Let's get this first date or second date where your quickie or a long time ago.

Speaker 7:          01:43:04       Wow. Tell me how you did it. I'm going to ask when you were younger, was working in equipment work better? Like what are you doing on a daily or weekly? How often were you? Um, were you a quick, quick or are good? Good. Take your time and draw it

Speaker 2:          01:43:21       stuff folks. Obviously funny and really we were putting our audience in danger. Showing them. We've seen, we've seen enough. If you guys want to go through, I want to say cringe. Afterlife. Jim Lee shot. He's a friend of the show. He's a great guy. I hope to hear from him soon. I'd love to get him involved in some kind of segment, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:43:46       because some dude at Jimmy is a true, like a, like a goof spoofer. I'm trying to think of like a walk back. Did we ever settle on a whack back man? For us there was the gas pack. I was personally the gift bag. I liked gathpath. Yeah, he's a, he's an original gath packer. Alright. Well, I got to say, I hope the show was okay. I felt like I was bombing in here, especially the first half. You're doing fine because you start sweating. There's nobody in here too. I'm like, oh my God. Stuff without either. It's tough without Isla. And that's why me and my friends, we started playing music. What called the jokes last time either was gone. We started working on this song called Goldmine and now the eel is gone. We finalize this. It's a beautiful tribute to isla client. Um, my better half. I miss her and I love her. So with that being said, this is the world debut of the jokes and guys, I will see you next Friday at the regular time with Bob Berman. I'm so excited for that and I hope you enjoyed the show. Would that being said, play us off

Speaker 13:         01:45:27       where I can go out and do what you use in a bowl and I'm so and a to stones throw because I just bought, you know, it's just me listening to ed goes with a sunset. It's all fools gold man. Yeah man, I'm so, so cold though. About a stone's throw, but I just want, you know, I tapped the vein. The vault is full. I had the midas touch, but it's all fools gold with that and I'm to.
