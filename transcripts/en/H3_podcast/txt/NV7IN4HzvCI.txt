Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Welcome to the h three podcast experience. We're trying to compete with Joe Rogan over here. Hell yeah. My theory is that a podcast can never compete with an experience. He's gotten an experience. Right. So I'm trying to, even the playing field a little bit. You need to see weed pills or something. Yes, I need some kind of supplement experience supplement, but they get to hymns. It Felix Gray and audible for sponsoring us today. And if you haven't already guessed today, I would say are good. Arguably the most successful youtuber of all time. Bieber. Bieber. Yeah, I can't, there's no argument. No fight number. Can we say number two? No, because like the idea is that like if you make stuff outside of Youtube, you're more successful. I don't think that's true. I'm saying like their youtube or is make way more money than me. More people. I mean, I don't think it's like, you know, it's legit and successful just cause you know, in my mind I feel like it, there's some truth to it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       If you can escape in a way, it's almost, it is an escape because it, it really frees you, like what you do with your comedy acts is kind of not compatible with youtube. You think? Kind of, I dunno. Uh, well it's like maybe, maybe not the whole stage and the lighting and all the coordination and disappearing for a year. Yeah. Well that, that's really why I left or not left eye when I was, you moved on. I just wanted to do live stuff. I mean, even when I was posting the early videos, like I just wanted to perform on stage, I was doing theater. That's where we want it to do. When I was performing those videos, like I'd be like, I really want to go to stage with these. And then I performed them on stage and if I had posted the video, it wouldn't get that much of a reaction when you realized like, Oh, if I didn't post this stuff and people heard it for the first time and the room was, it was, it was a exciting so, well, I didn't introduce you Bo Burnham.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       Okay. Um, basically I would say one of the most beloved comedy acts for the past decade, including two of my favorite, what and make happy on Netflix. Netflix. What's on Youtube? Yeah. What's back on Netflix? It's bad. It's everywhere. It's everywhere folks. And he's just written and directed a new movie that's out today on limited release, right? Nationwide in two weeks. Yeah, in New York and La. And then it'll be out somewhere else. Eighth Grade, which by the way is getting rave reviews and 98% on rotten tomatoes. Whoa. Let me hit you with the sound. Soundbar 99 now they raised like, you know what? Fuck that 99. Ooh, can we get it to a hundred? Can we off that one fucking loser? No, we can't. Are you sure? Go for it. Yeah. Can you and the interns on it? He is where he's up to word scenario. Not you're good. I would tell if he had a book hanging on. It's all good. I wouldn't, I wouldn't let you and with that I'm free, but it does have 100% of my heart. Appreciate it. I went and I saw it last night. It's very kind of, I missed the screening and I absolutely loved it. You missed the screening. I missed the screening, so

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       I went and saw it last night. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Um, how, how are you feeling about it? I mean, the movie's out. It's getting rave reviews. It's getting rave reviews. I'm feeling great. I want to say I'm really grateful to be here. I'm a fan of yours, Ethan. I'm a fan of the podcast. It's true. Um, you know, and um, though I haven't been like posting a lot on youtube. I'm watching the shit all the time. Yeah. All the time. I mean, like my main relationship with the Internet is as a viewer and as someone just on, can I ask, who do you frequent? I was like, who do you like? You're, you know, you're one of the few people, like it's really popular that I watch. I mean, I don't know if it's like it to me, but like I, I, it's sort of what the movie ended up being like, I love people in the Internet that no one's watching.

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       Uh, I love the review review, Bruh. I love him under review Bra, the report of the week. Oh yeah, he's, yeah, he's a legend and incredible. Um, but I really love like people on the Internet that no one's watching. So I'll often like search something and then view it by Upload Day. I mean, you're in the nitty gritty. Yeah. So I love deep dives. Like there's this dude who's a hoarder who cooks hot dogs on candles and it's very nauseated and see, have character or is it just the, it's the intrigue of it all. Does he have character? Like it seemed very entertaining or no, it's bone chilling. It's chilling. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's like him. Like can we show, we give him a shout out. I don't know his name and I don't know if he's in. No, but really it's like he takes a tour of his like hoarding house and he cooks like he called some sausages and there's a video of him making sausages and peaches.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       It's absolute incredible. We could probably pull it up. Yeah. It's a lot of cooking sausages and it's really not the hot dogs. And sausages or the PT calls it sausages and peaches, but it is most certainly hot dogs. Okay. Okay. But no, I just like, I, I've, I dunno, but yeah, no, I, I've watched a lot of [inaudible] them from the background and I want to talk a lot about that. But first I want to ask like, what was your motivation almost for writing this film? Because it's a departure, it's kind of a surprise to a lot of your fans of like, Oh wow, where did this movie come from? It's very specific. Yeah, it'd be too, with a very specific narrative, like you had a purpose. So I'm wondering what, what was, what motivated you to go that route? It was like, it's about a girl, like a 13 year old girl last week, eighth grade.

Speaker 2:          00:05:16       And you know, I did stand in for like, and found it already by the way. Amazing. We'll cut it. I, it'll be, it'll be a hard letting me Andreas conversation. Um, I I, you know, perform standup for a long time and I was feeling anxious and I wanted to sort of talk about the internet and my own anxiety in a way and sort of I had felt like my anxiety for a long time. It was like very specific to me being a 25 year old comedian with like an audience. Um, and then I would like do my shows and like young kids would come up to me and say they felt like me and they felt like they knew what I was going through. Even when I was talking about was like being on stage in front of thousands of people. I'm like, why is this resonating with you?

Speaker 2:          00:05:55       Um, and I just think that sort of pressures, the weird pressures that are usually only afforded to like d list celebrities have now been democratized and given to everybody. So I was always interested in like, who are telling a story about someone on the Internet that nobody's watching. Cause the Internet tends to end, the culture at large tends to only talk about the people on the Internet that are being seen. But the majority of people on the Internet and there's a lot more and more who are just talking to the camera and nobody's watching. That's 99% of the videos that are uploaded. 99.9 you know, and the kind of, the only thing we talk about is like people that go viral and as someone that went viral, it's really not that interesting. You know what I mean? It's like the actual interesting thing is just trying to engage with this thing and trying to be seen and trying to be heard.

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       And to me the people that weren't being heard, we're actually engaged in a much deeper, more honest and thing. Well there was one of the central themes I think that I extracted from it was like how social media or this abundance of all this going on with youtube and twitter and instagram is affecting kids. Cause I think when there's a five year difference between us, but when I grew up there was no like grow hap as a kid was hard enough. But then when you have all this new social media introduced to them and the way that you portray the girl, how she's glued to the social media, it was very accurate. I think. Like how is this affecting kids? I don't know all the time is that I don't quite know exactly like, and truly it was me wanting to talk about how it felt to me and how it felt to me was it made me feel nervous and weird and unsure of myself.

Speaker 2:          00:07:26       And that seems like, I mean social media. Yeah. Yeah. Just having to sort of represent yourself, having to live your life and then also live your life on this other place. And then the sense of like, because of that floating behind yourself through situations. Um, I just think it's like weird and disembodied and like a little disassociated or something. But more than anything it was like I, I'm happy for people to like leave the movie thinking about that stuff, but I don't want the movie to be like a Ted talk or like, I mean some like finger wagging shit cause that's what so annoys me. It wasn't, by the way, let me just say one more thing. Yeah, but, but like that, I dunno, it just feels like the Internet hasn't even, in least in popular media hasn't even been described, let alone figure it out.

Speaker 2:          00:08:13       Like so. So, um, yeah, I just wanted to portray it and portray it, how it feels to her and me a little bit, which is just weird. It's just like, it's a lot, but it's not like, it's just shitty. It's not like, it's like we should just, Oh, if we had through our phones and the ocean and we'd be happy. It's like, it's both. We're super connected, we're super lonely, we're super stimulated, we're super numb, we're self expressing and objectifying. It's like, yeah, I wouldn't be here without the Internet. You know what I mean? Like obviously I'm so, so grateful for it. Um, but also it's, you know, there's, there, there may be a happy medium between like 60 minutes talking about like narcissist the kids and like come on creators or whatever the fuck youtube conversation is where it can't

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       self examine it at all. I feel like, well I'm on my part, I'm a grown man more or less. And I've recently pretty much quit using social media because it's honestly too much for me, for me, like, uh, like even me for for a long day, I had like a quota for myself for, I was like, I need to post every day on twitter once. Yeah. Cause in a way it's like if I don't tweet, do I exist still? Like am I still in the minds of these people? And I found by the way, that the answer is very much, yes, you still do exist if you don't tweet. But like there was just a really unhealthy interaction I had with it. Like checking it first thing in the morning. I had that too. I started to sitting down and he would be on my phone. I was like, this is fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       This is totally, because you don't really get a lot of time out of that. You sit down at what do you mean? What does that buy you? Like 30 seconds, 30, 40 minutes at most, right. That's a edition. We'll get into that. Um, but yeah, I, I, uh, but that, that is part of what the mood is hoping to get at is that like, it isn't like sit down to pee and you use your phone for that. So you would just open twitter really fast while you were on the John. Yeah. And if it's cold, I'll piss through the space and the, the seat in the bowl and all over my pants. It's nothing happens. Does that happen to you still? They step in when I was a kid and I would have like a morning wood and like, cause your Dick points down into the bowl.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       Yeah, definitely. But you're still able to pay through the whole soft. Yeah, I was just kidding. Uh, so, uh, yeah. Um, I was trying to explore that. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no, no. I'm just like, totally kidding. I just made up a really specific joke that's never happened. You've never paid through the crack when you were a kid. All right, let's get on. Let's get it. Let's get off. I tried to be vulnerable with you. But yeah, I think like people look at me, I'm like, man, I'm so glad I'm not an eighth grade he morning, I'm so glad I'm not so awkward on, I don't have to deal with social media. And I'm like, you're the worst people in social media or 30 year olds and young people in their late twenties like from talking with the kids, the kids have the best chance of being shell on it cause they like actually have a little bit of self awareness and kind of have grown up with it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       It's the 30 year olds that pretend like they're not, you know, addicted to it and becoming a suit. I just like, I can't believe what my friends look like online. I came, there was so many people that I, I don't mind in real life and I hate interesting hate them and there's never the opposite. There's never any like what is it that they do online that makes you hate them? It just so transparent, right? What everyone's doing, things trying to look like peachy and or no, trying to look pg or trying to or trying to be ironically peachy or you know like uh, I mean humblebrag is the word of the 21st century. I heard you say something that I really liked is something that's been ringing with me. It was like if you ironically hate something, it's not really better than like if you, ironically if you're self aware of doing something that you'd have like, yeah, it's not really different. Yeah. No everyone, like you see that on a lot of people being

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       like clickbaiting ironically, but it's like, well you still know you're still doing that. It's like, and I did that when I was 16 and 70. It was like by my merge, I'm a sellout. It's like that. No, you're still a fucking stuff. Like it doesn't being self aware of saves you nothing the most. And it's like the ironic shit, the most ironic shit online is like old spice commercials and Geico commercials where they're going on and being like, this is a Geico commercial wink. And it's like, fuck you. There's like dead pool, it's like a $200 million movie winking at you. And it's like, is that cool? I don't know what I mean, I'm just saying like this sort of like surrealist, cool, crazy adult swim. Like, uh, aesthetic has been totally co opted by, like all state, all state. But you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          00:12:35       I feel like it's a, I dunno, it just feels to me. Let me ask you, how does making a movie compare to your other creative endeavors that you've done so far? It was good, man. I was just desperate to work with other people. I was like, um, you know, stand up, you just look to yourself. And I was so tired of my own head. I mean, I was just so tired of my voice and my face. Um, so I just wanted to work with people again. I did theater like growing up and that's what I really love and that's what I, when I fell in love with ships. So, um, yeah, it was just about working with people and getting out of my own head. And that was nice. That's awesome. Because like trying to explore my own anxiety by being alone on stage. How far it's surprisingly ended up making it worse.

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       Um, you'll have problems with anxiety. Oh yeah. I also have suffered from that, but I'm curious, have you found something that's helped you? How long have you been suffering from anxiety? Longer in hindsight than I thought when I was in high school, Sophomore year I was in the hall in, out of the hospital with stomach problems thinking, uh, I just like, I did like drank barium thinking I'm having all this like most of the poles in my intestines and I was just nervous shitting my pants every day. It's funny, I find it interesting that you weren't aware that it was anxiety. We're feeling will, it was so constant that I didn't think it could have been. It was every day. Um, which actually probably should have pointed to anxiety, but, but, um, and then it really, when I was 23, I had my first panic attack on stage and that was like, oh shit.

Speaker 2:          00:14:09       How did you, how did the show continued? It continued. I've had like, you know, push through it. Yeah. I've had about 10 onstage and shit. What happens in that moment? You become like very self aware tunnel vision, like tunnel vision and then like, you know, numb body and then just a total like out of body feeling. And what's so weird, it's so weird about it is that it's with, it's, it's happening within the structure of a show that is rich enough to but to the word, you know what I mean? So it's like, I can't even like go, oh, I'm feeling like I have to, I have to like say it ends up like I'm in groundhog's day and I like, or like I have a script they have to keep to, so I have this inner monologue freaking out and then I'm having to perform by drowned that you're able to still like perform the script while having a somewhat out of body experience.

Speaker 2:          00:14:57       Yeah, it was, but it was like, it was like I'd be a little out of breath. So I'd be the entire show for 20 minutes would be existing like on like the inhale kind of. Um, it definitely wasn't my best work. Hmm. Um, you know, uh, do you remember for me my anxiety, I think I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and I had like a very specific moment of like almost breaking like a breaking point where it just came out of nowhere. Did you have a moment like that? It was actually, I had a panic attack, um, in Providence, Rhode Island, which is funny cause like, you know, I've taught people that went to the show. I've heard this now, don't, you know, I don't think my parents were there and couldn't tell what was happening. Providence, Rhode Island, it was like a theater, like 3000 people had a panic attack.

Speaker 2:          00:15:45       It was really bad. Um, then went to New York, had three shows, had a panic attack in the middle show, went to see the Martian the next day and got very, very angry because I, it, it wasn't about anxiety and I didn't know it felt like so perfect for my life. Like how is this story about a guy alone on Mars logged in it, it felt so true to me. And then it was just like about how he's like a good botanists or something. Movies probably chill. I was just in a bad place and then I had a panic attack on the train to DC the next day. Um, which was another show and I had like, this was like the first week of a tour, there was like 45 shows and 50 days and that was when I was like, there's something going on here. Yeah. Like this is bad and I can never do this again.

Speaker 2:          00:16:30       Um, that, that, that was the worst time of my, I've had a pretty fortunate life. That was definitely one of the hardest. Yeah. Stretches of my life. And like how did you kind of get through it? I mean, did you find at the time, was it like for me it was almost unbearable. Like I couldn't even live, I was like completely debilitated for like six months. I would say try meditation, you know, I haven't meditated for sure. The problem is there's just a show every night and there was like very like surreal comical things where I'd be like googling how to deal with stage fright, you know, before a show in front of 3000 people. And the answers would be like, don't worry, like if you're pr, if you're doing this in front of your class or at town hall, like people don't really care about what you're saying.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       I'm like, no, nope. There's 3000 people that have paid $40 in her have waited like it is. They do care. Yeah. It like really helped me to find out that like Barbara streisand struggled with Dell. Like I actually really helped too. It's such a weird thing, like how you almost have to be more of a fucking psycho to not experience anxiety. Exactly. Like it's, it's like being the president. Like I dunno how you, well, I've long held that you have to be an actual sociopath that even want to be president. Yeah. So those guys don't feel like, I just feel cold blooded. Yeah. We got a good one right now. But yeah, they're usually pretty bad. Yeah. He's, I get the feeling he's

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       not having much self awareness, self aware of moments right now. Yeah. Yeah. No. Um, yeah, my mind, I know my body's on fire. Um, yeah. Meditation. What did you do dude? The thing is like I'm not, I'm like a somewhat sensitive guy, but for some reason I never talked to anyone about it. Like I don't, yeah, I didn't say I was my biggest mistake and that's what fucked me up for long. And looking back in hindsight, I was like, why didn't I, why was I so private about it? Cause I thought I was, I thought I was actually having like a psychotic break. I thought I was almost for sure that I was schizophrenia and I was so crushed by that fact and I felt like I would crush my parents by telling them that. And I felt just like I couldn't talk about it at all and I held onto it just hoping it would go away.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       But it never did for me. I don't know if you felt this, like my worry was, if I say it, it's real. You know what I mean? Like, if I admit that I'm going through there, it's, it's, I've spoken it and now I'll never stop thinking about it. And it is for anyone worried about this. It is the exact opposite. It's like speaking, it is the salvation. So that's what helped me is when I finally talked to them about it because you, it's just like, it's like stand up. It's just you and your head talking to yourself and it makes everything so much worse because when you've talked to somebody about it, first of all, it's really a very, very literal getting it out. But then people can talk to and be like, look, you're not fucking, you're not schizophrenia and you're not dying. It's just anxiety.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       Like the things that I hoped for myself but wouldn't believe people were confirming for me, that was the beginning of, of, of healing. But I think the thing that really changed for me was having a sick, like a significant other and, and my wife, right? Someone that really, like I felt comfortable talking about it and being myself and knowing that cause a lot of the anxiety that I had was very much like social and a lot of ways. Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah, of course. So a lot of that was alleviated when you find someone that like you think doesn't care. Yeah. And you're alone in it together or whatever, and then you can hate the world army of two or something. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to get said. Yeah. That's beautiful. Yeah. I um, I never took medicine though, but frankly I wish I did.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       Yeah. I think it would've helped a lot. I almost took Beta blockers for performance when I felt like I was going to Beta blockers. We've talked about that here. I don't know what the Fuck Beta blockers, I don't know anything and it sounds like it's like a nineties board game or something. Yeah. But I really feel like doing it. Um, but yeah, man, it's like the sort of my thing was like, you know, if I'm being truly honest with myself, it's like the two sides of the same coin that like I, by speaking it out loud and seeing that other people were going through it and it ended, it wasn't unique to my experience of being because I just thought like, oh it's, this is happening to me because I'm living an insane life in a very specific circumstance. You know

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       what I spoke and I realize like it's the two things. It was the thing I was most terrified of and the thing that actually saved me, which is like I'm not unique and I'm not alone. You know, I think I was maybe deep down wanting it to be singular because you know, I've just, you know, I want to have a very singular experience when I'm going through. You can understand. Right? I think that that sort of mindset is common too. Anxious people and an idea of of it is so visceral. I sort of describe it like having anxiety feels like, um, like I'm riding a bull, like my bull is a nurse, my nervous system and I just have to hold onto it. And then like, being in the world feels like everyone else's, a, an equestrian, you know what I mean? Just like perfectly in sync with their own nervous system.

Speaker 2:          00:21:33       And it just, it just isn't true. Totally. So many silent battles of it and absolutely for some, and it's so weird. Like I, uh, I hadn't, I co I saw a little bit of my special that I didn't scenes, you know, in, uh, make happy the last one in two years and I saw it and I couldn't, I would not believe that person was nervous. Yeah. I wouldn't believe I would think like, oh, he's talking about anxiety too, just, you know, if he thinks it's like in and, and, and, but like he's not nervous. And I was, I frankly didn't know that it was such a battle for you after the first show. I saw obed sobbed backstage because, because like, I mean, I slept two hours in the night before. I was shaking like um, yeah it uh, yeah it was, it was rough. It was um, it's incredible that even through that you can still do shit cause like thinking back on myself, I wasn't famous at the time when I was having my worst anxiety.

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       I still suffer from it a lot. But like back in the day I was so like even just talking to someone was almost like a a bat like a real battle for him. Yeah. Going on a date was like the fuck and like very much like what the movie is that it describes is like these mundane ordinary things can sometimes be the bravest thing you can do it. Right. Exactly. And that's what the movie was trying to do is like portray it very much and it works for third year. I appreciate it. And it was like 13 year old life for a 13 year old or someone with social anxiety. Every tiny moments feel like life and death and it is, it's so important to overcome it and just say, you know what, I still have to do this. And I feel like that is really what makes you overcome it. Yes. And, and, and like I just think movies tend to over us like push situations into drama and confrontation that that needs to justify it. I think people are so fucking nonconfrontational in real life. So nonconfrontational like have you ever like just raised your voice at the guy in like the grocery store line and then your heart is pounding for 40 minutes afterwards? Like yeah. Like you ever seen an argument and you're like, Holy Shit. You know what I mean? I just think life is very,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       the drama of our lives literally plays out very small. But subjectively in personally it's very, very big. So the movie was just trying to be like, can we show those tiny tiny moments very successfully? Like the scene where she's gone to the pool party was just like, I felt that so much. You know what I mean? And I think everybody watched you will feel it so much. So it definitely, I love, I love that so much capturing, appreciate it. What part is, they're just not chill. And we were trying to also like really try to look at kids, not nostalgically, not like a memory, but just try to see them like, yeah, yeah. Aliens. Like what if we just forgot what these things meant to us in hindsight, but just looked at it fresh and it's like a pool party is like, okay. It's like, okay, so forget everything you know about bombarding.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       Forget that it's like a cultural standard and realize that it's like, okay. It's like a bunch of kids whose bodies are exploding half dressed hole in the ground with water. It's like, wow, how is this part of our lives? Like? Yeah. How is this any pass it like rite of passage for kids. Yeah, absolutely. And finally, like you just touched on it, it doesn't get better as an adult go. No. Imagine I cannot mind taking off my shirt fucking the worst ever. I'm still like, I wouldn't do that now. I would just not do it. Would you do, would you go in with a shirt on? Did you do that when you were a kid? I would shirt on in the pool. I'll tell you why. I was shirt on. I had a giant mole on my back has been removed. You can grab my mom did it by your mom.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       It was camp. She thought it was cancerous cause it was like this fucking big but that's why I wish shirt on now. I keep the shirt on because um, I'm fat. Hold up. Wait, your mother, your mother removed them all off your back? She, okay. Maybe I, I described that weirdly. She opted for it to be removed with or you think I went and that's not what happened at all. Yeah. No. Okay. Chill. But we got that covered. Okay. That's good. That's great. Um, yeah I would, the sad shit is I would, I would always work, wear my tee shirt in the pool, but I would like pretend like you mean I'm like fall into the pool and be like, Oh shit, my shirts that's, oh, it's rough. Right. You know everyone, even as a kid everyone's like, come on dude. Yeah. You really, really like, you forget how self aware you are at that age.

Speaker 1:          00:26:01       Like at that age, you're in on the joke of yourself. Like you're making fun of each other for your voice is cracking and shit. Like you know what's going on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's brutal. Sure. On Man. I've seen I fully clad, I mean shoes and everything. I've seen that before. That's pretty well some stuff. Cardio Wifi. Yeah. Damn. So would you share it on these that you insured on if you went to a pool party? I don't pool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm an endorsement. Most definitely. Do you have it? Are you, would you camp, do you do any outdoor activities? Would you play video games? Like what am I outside people camp. Yeah. People. Yeah, there's fuckers out there. They're all granola. There's people out there that do stuff and I'm, and I'm genuinely jealous. I say when I meet somebody, I'm like, you're the kind of guy that does stuff, aren't you?

Speaker 1:          00:26:50       I know. You know what I mean? To me that's like, yeah, if I just like ate the right stuff and went hiking and things, I'd be happy. But can you imagine going hiking? No. Can you imagine it ever went to Brian? I've never went. Never. I just, everyone hikes here. I've never been, they seem so happy. They're out there dead behind the eyes. They're lying about it. No, no way. Dan, are you a high, I mean, I know that like, like Dan and Ian are very much people that do stuff and I go, who are you? Well you meet these people. They're like, that was Dan. Sorry Dan, do go hiking. No, I mean when uh, when a girlfriend a few years ago, she would force me to all the time. But that's not, that doesn't really count. You didn't like it, you know, it was that the main problem in the relationship that she wanted to hike in more ways than walk and hike.

Speaker 1:          00:27:37       Yeah, exactly. I'm going to dump her. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I like those people. Are you jealous people that do stuff? Cause I'm, I know. Oh, they're always planning stuff. They're going to like art exhibits. Yeah. They're also liking thrilled when they find a bag of like dried cranberries. Like, I don't want to live that life. Find a bag of drugs. They're all like, oh, you know what I mean? I didn't want to eat like Eggo waffles and drink red bull. I'm saying what, what are you, what's your, what's your main hobby? You probably work a lot. No, no, I have a true, true lazy streak. Like truly, um, I like, we'll sit around for a long, long time and then like have a burst of doing something. And so what do you do when you're at home? Uh, homeless men, homeless men. I've got dogs, I've got the old friends.

Um, I, uh, I've watched a lot of, I went onto, I know I watch a lot of stuff. This is my problem. I'm home all day and I don't know what I do. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if that's what you're getting at. I'll spend, I'll be at home all fucking day and at the end of the day I'll be like, I did, I don't even, I didn't even like turn on a show and watch a show. Like, at least I would be able to say I did that, but I don't know what I do. I'll watch like videos of like 10 year olds doing like Yankee candle halls. What like 10 year olds? Like they, they, there's a lot of Yankees. Yeah. Like 10 year old kids that like 300 subscribers that like go to Yankee candle and bring a bunch of candles home and they're low a hall. A candle.

The vr actually like inspired the movie a little bit visually, like wanting to feel like you're in this thing. Kind of looking around and like when people start making like really cool short films and stuff on that and there's been a few, it's going to be, it's incredible. It's like an, it's a new medium, not in the way like television and movies are different mediums. It's, it's a different medium in the way. Like movies and books are for me, so I'm very excited about that. But I've got switch. I didn't plan Mario tennis aces. Sweet. I love the switch. Yeah, I just do handheld. Yeah.

I know this. We just talked about anxiety and now call him on your mind.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       Now that's hard. Horrible. Well, you know, I used to say fascinating. It's a good word, but I lean on it a little bit. Yeah. And I got mehmed into the fucking ground. That's incredible. And I watched like late night shows and I watched people and they say, I listen to a lot of podcasts. They say fascinating. A lot faster pumps. You can even have it sound bus. You can tell what rose of listening. You're like, I can't get away from it. You can tell what, uh, Bros had been listening to Jordan Peterson by how all of a sudden they start saying presupposition. That's sort of saying presupposition. I'm like, that's cool Bruh. I know where you got that. Oh, you love that word. Yeah. Oh my God. Dan, just a man to come on. This is not fascinating at all. Not um, yeah, so we, the presupposition was that you weren't going to come in here.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       This was pre suppose. Um, so let me ask you, you came up, I'm coming up. I want the world to know. I've got to let it show. Yeah. You got to let it chill. This is so, yeah. I fucked you up. You came up, you went viral, right? Hell yeah. I feel like back then going viral is that a Hashtag Hashtag viral viral, I became an internet sensation. You what term I love and please keep using it. And it was true back then. There was such thing as real. I felt like it was real viral videos and viral videos. Yes. Meant like from nothing. Yes. From the depths of, yeah. It's bullshit of Youtube. Libyan cannot go viral. James, I'm saying I'd love to check it. You can't go. That's not virality of virus. Yeah. It's like a dude fucked a monkey. He got aids and from the depths of out of nowhere, aids was born exactly viral.

Speaker 1:          00:40:21       But it's like, oh, I got a cold. It's like, well the has been around. That's not, you know what? That's a weird analogy. It's a weird analogy, but maybe, you know what I mean? It's more like you have 8 million subscribers. Most of your subscribers saw your fucking thing. It didn't go viral. Yeah. You just, yeah, exactly. It's like, I like, my question is do viral videos still exists because I don't see that happening anymore. They do. They do. I don't think like, yeah, I don't think I would would've worked. No, I don't think I would have been discovered. It's a bummer. I don't like, why is that? We do think cause youtube turned into a fucking studio and a and the network and you go to the trending page and it's fucking late night, late night clips, movie trailers and music videos. It's like fuck. Like, you know what I mean? Like when we started, it was like this was going to be the people's medium. It was like cool and different and now it's just like, I don't know why they do. I really, I don't understand why they do that. I don't either. It's like, dude, just don't put that shit there. They don't need the fucking views and the best they do is like support their creators. But are they supporting like no, the, the little creators, the ones with a bunch of subscribers don't need help and I don't the specifics. I know people

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       are getting fucked over specifically, but it's like, yeah, it's kind of like the class of 2006 to 11 rows or whatever and like, or you know, I think it's hard to become anything now. I think like the established, it's really hard to break through. Yeah, and the only people that I see breaking through now are basically people who are producing. Just really just really the worst stuff that's very easily consumable. That's very clickable. I think the thumbnail and the title are so important. Now let's walk through that. It's really, that's like people start there and then work backwards. Money. Yeah. Cause I remember I all my videos are posted like lowercase, just the title of the song you mean? And I remember like even me later in the clips I had to do big capital Bo Burnham hd, whatever the fuck. Um, but uh, that's not, but like bill worst bill wirtz, the guy that did the history of [inaudible] is the one exception.

Speaker 2:          00:42:32       I think there are some others. I'm sure there are. And, and, and again, it's not, it's not that, I wouldn't say it's not the kids, the specific people posting themselves that aren't a value. It's just I think the value system or whatever that's like, that you're taught to, you know, I don't think it encourages people to be creative like it used to. Right. Or got out of the way. It's like, I dunno. It's crazy. Well, a lot. I don't think it was all going to turn into blogging. Yeah. And like, that's cool if you've logged, but like even musicians, like on youtube, they're like little indie musicians start their music video with like, hey guys, this is my music video. I hope you check it out. And then it cuts and I'm like, whoa. I think the problem is that Youtube's algorithm favors lots like daily or even more than daily uploads of basically to succeed on Youtube in this environment you have to post like every day and fan engagement.

Speaker 2:          00:43:30       Yeah, and that is kind of like crazy terms. That's just like what's on top right now because it's what youtube is selected probably inadvertently to dominate. Right. And it's not that, it's not that there shouldn't be that. I mean there are people yourself included who are very good at commentary who should be posting a lot, but that should be one part of an ecosystem. I'm saying in theory this thing is just a blank medium, right? Where anything can post where anything can. I would just, I just remembered in 2006 being like, Oh man, I wonder what youtube is going to be like in 10 years. It's going to be like all the Oscar winning shorts are, I mean, who cares? It doesn't matter if it's not the Oscars, but I'm just saying it's going be like people are going to be uploading, you know, like what, when I made my special, I made this big thing of like, I'm going to post it for free on youtube, you know, and then give it to Netflix. But I took way less of a pay so I could post referring on Youtube and I posted it for free on youtube. But I realized like the environment had changed so much that like, uh, no one even thought I was posting. They just thought it was like a rip

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       from Netflix. And I was like, Oh man, this place doesn't even exist for that anymore. Really? That's true. And then you see fucking, I mean, I don't know. So I'm sure there's some really good stuff. I don't want to be shitting on people. I'm like, these are things I struggle with. These are pressures, pressures, I feel. Um, but it's like, I don't know, around town, I see billboards for youtube red. And I'm like, it looks like a Disney channel. Like isn't this place the wild west? Isn't this like totally free? Why are we imposing like wire and it feels like creators themselves are inviting like the archaic standards of Hollywood to themselves. It's like you can be so much freer than this, I would think. Why? Why you making? Do you know what I mean? I don't think that, well, if you look at someone like filthy frank, I don't know if here that know who that he was someone who kind of embodied what you're talking about where he was very much his own man.

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       He very much did his own thing, didn't conform to any anything. It was just totally fucking nuts and everybody loved it. But the problem was that he was always being demonetized. Youtube was always fucking with his videos and in a way that didn't really make it sustainable. I used to love shoe. Nice. Who like use your nice drink glue. It was hold a, what did you say to shoot and I says he's a legend. Legend. He called Isla and Israeli con once and they wanted to kill her or something. But I was like, oh nice. We still had in my head, I still, me and my girlfriend, we always said thank yeah that, oh he's the greatest isn't it? But it just like, yeah, but you and I says he's not killing it anymore. Well he's killing, well he is living, he's killed but not, but like I'm just saying it should be weirder.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       Right. I that that that's all I just mean it should be like, but I'm glad he said bell works because that does kind of our works and and, and you know what? I know that there's like hundreds of them, thousands of the just the system isn't in place too. I'm saying like what I'm saying really is not going after the people making stuff and even the people making stuff would be so much better if the, if the medium itself was encouraging actual creative expression. I wish they had a department or some kind of dedication to doing that. But as far as I'm aware, they're just, they don't, and it's value. Why are a bunch of NBC executives like the people that work at youtube or like a bunch of fucking dusty. Yeah. I shouldn't be saying this shit, but whatever, whatever. I'm friends with them.

Speaker 1:          00:46:50       They know, they know. We all hate him. All right. I live with that. Yeah. It's like when you walk into Youtube headquarters and you're like, is this the m and m store? Where the fuck Emma me, me and it's like, I don't know. The Internet to me is like dirty and weird and crazy and like so human. And if you did it just scratch past the surface, you fall in that side. Part of the problem that's happening is that like with net neutrality and all, all this stuff going on is that people don't want the Internet to be that dirty, crusty place anymore. They want it to be, you know, buttoned up and they want it to be predictable and they want it to be a not just another thing. Yeah. I mean that's, that's where the movement is, is going. Yeah. It's,

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       it's, it's hard because I'm on both sides a little bit. Cause I also look at the Internet and don't go like the only problem with the Internet isn't that it needs to be freer. You know what I mean? There, I mean, there is also crazy, you know, I don't know if any of us should be able to watch like people blow their heads off, you know what I mean? And stuff like I don't know if but, but, or worse. Yeah. Blow, they're much, much worse things on the Internet. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you. The snakes. Yes. And you know what I'm talking about. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:48:02       Yeah. Yeah. Well what, what do you think of, um, when you came up on youtube, there wasn't such a notion as, as Internet celebrity or youtube. So, no, when there wasn't a standard, there wasn't like a thing you should be, there wasn't like a, uh, there wasn't a format, so it was just like people just doing random shit, unpolished, random shit, which is cool, you know, as opposed to like, if you want to, you know, I, I dunno, what do you like, what do you think? The old dude. But no, but I am I, yeah, but I am, I am across the old due to the, I mean I was in 2006 right when this thing started, but it's because I care about it so much and I want, you know, young people that are taking risks and making interesting things to like have a s and it's, I say this because I care about it because like every other medium has no fucking chance of being cool.

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       Really like, yeah, this is like the first like real medium where like everyone can actually access it and like the viral, even the idea of viral is, is uh, is uh, is a problem cause it, cause it immediately puts the idea that the only things worthy are the ones that are, that are um, being seen like a million times. You've got to find really cool channels with like 3000 views where it's some person giving advice or some person teaching piano and like, you know, well originally that's why youtube was all about was just a dude who wanted to make shit and share it with like their friends. I mean, that's why people made videos and the early days before you got paid for it. But now it's like, I think 95% of kids, if you ask them what's their dream job is to be a youtuber. Yeah. I find that pretty strange, Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       When I was a kid, people want it to be astronauts. Will you tubers weird? Cause it feels like it's like movie or no, I guess that would just be like moving, but youtube or it's weird that when you say youtube or that should have no meaning, right. That should actually be like something less diverse amount should be writers. So it was like, oh, what do you want to write? But when you say youtube or it's like, oh, that means like Hawkeye image. Hey, like this for that. You know that that's very true. But I don't think that's true, but I don't think it actually is true. It just, um, I do think will be your neighbors that are getting attention. Yeah. Yeah. That is what they mean. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:21       No, we're all fucking losers. I feel like that all the time. But I know what you mean. I love Youtube. I love so of what it was. Yeah. I mean what it is and like I get, I watch it. I like it. So I'm saying if kids are happy and everyone's happy doing this shit and people are happy watching it, that's like totally cool. Um, and, and I need to emphasize it like the real thing I'm pissed about is not that popular. Youtube creators are taking this space from these kids. The real thing are the movie studios, the movie trailers, the tonight show clips that like that is the most infuriating thing when you see like, um, I thought that uh, Shane Dawson, Tana con thing was awesome. It was so cool that that was incredible. And like what an incredible thing to do. Like form breaking any, it was so good.

Speaker 2:          00:51:10       Like I was blown away and it was, it was part and, and because of like Shane's personal relationship with his odd, it was that much more meaningful. So it's like a great like version of that, like a Louis throw weird version. So that was awesome. Yeah. So I know people are doing that. I just want to be like, you know, like I dunno like Kevin Hart doing like vanity fairs and you know, most viral questions, whatever. You know what I mean? It's tough and all the, no hate to any specific people. I'm just saying like, I know I can't believe it. We're, I can't believe it. Like they do it. These people sit in a room and they go like, how can we make something viral? And they make it and it goes viral because they called it viral in their headline. Why don't you like he said, I don't think that means anything anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:51:51       Like viral. And it was just back in the day, it was like there's a viral video, Yodel bowl, and it was, it was a double rainbow. You know what I mean? Like that's a viral video. It's a guy fucking tripping balls over a cup. I mean that's, you know, I don't think he's tripping balls. I think he's just deeply that that guy was a trip to the ball. Is that right? I personally think, and this is a time time old who goes the dynamite boom, probably the best of all time, one of the best of all time. And like it's similar with the movie, which is like cringe means a lot to me. You know what I mean? Like, and there's some like I love like, and like our cringe and that all that stuff is, it gets a little dark. I don't know why the cringe communities sometimes can be very mean, but I like all the videos but I, I re they're like deeply beautiful to me.

Speaker 2:          00:52:42       They're deeply vulnerable and wonderful and meaningful. Tristan, I'm saying like some people would watch the, that weird hot dog video, the guy blending the things and want to like tell him to kill himself or whatever. But I think it's like just so beautiful that we have access to people's most mortifying moments and I feel for them and I think cringing is a form of empathy and you know, well certainly it is. You're, you're embarrassed for them. Yeah. So like, and it's, and it's vulnerable and like that boom goes the dynamite. I think that's, that is me on stage if I just wasn't as good or what an r or not, you know, if I was, that is what it was happening for me. It's that I could just power through it. He's like having a panic attack and Reggie Miller is looking good. Reggie Miller is the best shit ever. Later he gets the rebound passed it to the man. Well, speaking of viral

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       videos, I mean you mentioned, you mentioned the hot dog peach. Ian Found it now first of all, this video, this is a [inaudible] because I guess he erased it. It was too, uh, too wild for this world. Yeah. But this has a 200,000 views, so we are really, this guy is kind of has a little bit of a fan base. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. So anyone can make it. Yeah. See everybody. It's so funny, after the conversation we had, it's going to act like I want more of this, which is just like, man, we need more of this. Yeah. Let's see. Do you know who were, where he, this guy is? He's in his kitchen or I mean like,

Speaker 4:          00:54:16       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:54:17       I wonder what was the impulse? This guy had to be like, I want to share this. But that's true. What is, no, but that's beautiful, right Jimmy? So this guy lives is, I mean, but he's not even taking inventory of what's in his house, but he's making the video of the, as the, as if this is normal and as if people want to learn how to make hot dogs and peaches. I mean, but really is in a bathroom. No, but this is truly beautiful and so deeply sad and funny and tragic. So we're learning about his life, seeing all these, oh, so the sausages or just actual fucking hot dogs. I love that he calls it sausage. She's feeling a little bourgeois today, but sees reaching for something, but he wants to teach us. He, yeah, he wants to share. It's beautiful. As beautiful. He's like, you know what? Basically what it implies is that it took me a lot to be able to learn. I've learned the skill of cooking these hot dogs. Yeah. And I think there's a sausage. Sorry. Don't mean to downplay the Karmanos of it and he, and he's blending peaches. But basically I found this secret, this wonderful looking at cooking it. I'm sorry. Oh, I miss, I uh, does that, I don't know if that just a little zap.

Speaker 4:          00:55:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       What I'm saying it is an event. I mean, it's different. He's like, I found this new way to do this. You guys, it's, but it's like, I don't, I can't explain it. This means a lot to me. This is beautiful. And why have I not seen this? This is really something. Why have I seen this? That's the real question. This is, this sounds like it's right up your acts of salsa.

Speaker 4:          00:55:55       Let me,

Speaker 1:          00:55:58       but I'm saying this is a glimpse into a life we never would have without this. Right. Pray to God. You never have a glimpse into this life. Right. Um, but, but, but not that. Not that we're just seeing it. We're seeing it through his pov. Yes. And like with his perspective, with his wants, it's incredible. It's, to me, it's so cinematic and increase. It's like some crazy beautiful, like harmony corrine. Like here, let me crank the volume. Actually want to watch this. It's eight minutes. So it's a lot. It's a lot. Yeah. That makes gimme this cat is, he gonna throw those dogs in the blender with the peaches. Oh my God. It's healthy in a way. He's like, listen, a little protein. A little fiber. Yeah, it's a balanced meal. Okay, let's skip forward it to them. To the fucking, he had one at one point, washes the thing in the sink, but the dog, he watches the dog and you got an, you got to rinse the dog's clothes.

Speaker 4:          00:56:50       Look at the trash and the ground and look at, he just really tossed that in there in a way that quite never. It's got a little Amarillo going on. A little. Yeah. Oh, why is it, why is there, why is there a toilet there? I don't understand the toilet.

Speaker 1:          00:57:10       His, his, his accident is also like in placeable.

Speaker 4:          00:57:14       Really? Unplaceable so let's cut to the, uh, the big moment. If you're worried,

Speaker 1:          00:57:23       this is an exciting for the audience. Trust me, it is. It's just sad. See, now he's living, he's look, look, look, go. Whoa. That looks like started the fucking, he started the wrong, his post place was just about to burn down. Yeah. Cause he started the wrong, because he was overreaching. He probably hasn't done this before. Oh, you think this is a new recipe? But he's, nobody's trying to act like he's didn't Tostito's man, I've noticed. Oh yeah. It's brand loyal.

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       Just saying, but wouldn't the world be a better place if we watched this with love? Am I insane? No, you're not at saying, I mean, I think people do, but also people are too. You have to have a certain level of maturity to be like, I love this guy and not be like, this guy's a fucking loser. Yeah. I mean, I think most people probably over the age of 20 or like having sympathy or repulsed in just whatever. Yeah. Listen, don't want, well, let's go. Let's get to the fireworks. Yup. Let's get them. Let's get to, I'm trying it, which is that towards the end

Speaker 4:          00:58:29       we're looking at, oh my God,

Speaker 1:          00:58:38       he's nervous. He's like, ah, you did double the cups up if you notice. So he, uh, he's uh, by you hip hop artist, right? Well, yeah, he doubled up. I think he just cherishes the content so much, you know, link. He does not lose the drop. So am I correct me if I'm wrong? He didn't blend the dogs. He sliced them little bites and not, well he did he blend it and put it into the already blended peaches? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm just trying to get the recipe straight. So if I'm gonna get this at home, either course cleanups, a breeze. You just leave everything there for 10 years. Huh?

Speaker 4:          00:59:23       Seriously. Seriously.

Speaker 1:          00:59:32       Hold on. I'm suspicious of this. Can I say that? Okay. Okay. But in what way? I think it's might be an art piece. Oh, it's an art piece. But regardless, I don't think this guy is real. I think he might be an actor. No, no, no, no, no. You know what I'm saying? Way Too. Specifical good way to spin. He hates it. He pours it out and yet still uploads it. Let's see. Now you're getting now. Now you're getting it. No, but it that they're all, they're all like, I can show you a video of a nine year old that has a claw machine in his house cause his mother like s like put a reverse mortgage on her house to buy him a claw machine that also looks like an art piece. I believe this that they're like Ian, pull that up. That's really going to be hard to find.

Speaker 1:          01:00:14       That was like super, but like it's like claw machine. Boy. I guess this is just that this, I mean I'm not saying that it's for sure fake, but I'm still skeptical. The thing is this predates kind of the era. I'm so skeptical of everything I see on the Internet to the point where I'm like, I don't know that this is real. Of course. No, no, there's, there's, what do they do? Bring all the fucking shit under there. Why not? It's just a, why is there a toilet in the bowl? Why is there a toilet in the room? He said no, he goes to the bathroom. Why is he cooks in the bathroom? Yeah. Where does he live? Does he live in the bathroom? Okay. You got to just take the whole thing as a package. You can pick and choose, but that's, I just, I'm just saying I have, I've seen red flag.

Speaker 1:          01:00:54       He's, okay. So he's cooking. He's hot dogs and peaches. And you're confused that he's going to the bathroom to get the water? No, but it's also perfect. It wouldn't be that hard to throw some tostitos and aback and bathroom right out. I mean, either way I listen. I don't, I don't want to take, I think it's real. You don't have to know. I like of all the conspiracies I've had to walk people through, you know, I'm a much happier to do this then like the moon, the moon, Israel. I think the moon's real as far as I, a friend does not think the moon is real. You have a moon Downer. Deeply deep. He would, he would draw drawed. My friend drawn Carmichael, who I did special for your trail. He's very, um, well, what's the story about the mountain? Not that it's not real or does he actually think it's like a Hologram? Oh No, no. They'll going to the moon never happened. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be done. No, no. They're going to the moon in that. How do you still believe that in this day and age? That really blows my mind. He can make a good case. Really? You want to try to convince me he would do a good job? I don't believe it, but, but um, the Moana is fake, ladies and gentlemen. You heard it. The moon. It's doesn't exist at all. All right, well

Speaker 4:          01:02:01       I do want to see how this ends. If I can be frank with you. I mean, it looks very real. Everything okay?

Speaker 1:          01:02:08       If it's fake, it's the greatest production designer of all time. Right? Like it's beautifully put together. That's true. This guy would be going places right now if he would be like, it just, it just like incredibly up the flat, the two flashlights. Are you kidding me? That's incredible detail. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:02:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:28       Oh, he's, no, he's not American. You know that, right? He sounds like Scandinavian or something. Speaking English was, you hear that? He said I hadn't caught that before and abandoned for a couple of days. Go back. Let's put the pieces together. This might be,

Speaker 4:          01:02:47       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:02:50       Oh, what? That's weird.

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       What is his house like? Where if this is where he goes to cook, why does and why would a guy like this have like, uh, another, he's got two houses on it. I'd like to think he's like, yeah, he was my assistant multimillionaire with like a bun, like 15, just shit holes. This is real by the way. That, but that detail like you could never, you can never write it. You could never write it. Yeah. Stranger than fiction as they say. What is niceness? Is this fuck with you? This is us right now. Okay. You want to click it? Let's see. Is this weird? Wow. This is us live right now. I hate it. And then, no, no, no. You have to, well you have to wait until we opened us live. Okay. Here, let me mute it so that at least that, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          01:03:47       You have to like yell. But then it's like, it's so bad cause they hear us through the laptop and it was just repetitive. I made that mistake before. Okay. This is so weird that like, God, yeah, this is too mad at, this is a, this is a panic attack right now basically. Yeah. This is what it feels like. Yeah. This is, I'm having a panic attack right now. Okay. All right. We've, we've, oh, that's a good dude. It's awesome. Wait, can we get more meadow with it? Well, I just, we just cut to the wide, so in a moment it's going okay. Good names within dreams. Within dreams. Have you seen the lights, camera, Jackson's interstellar review reviews of all time? By the way, I just want to say, okay, that, um, uh, eighth grade, the reviews keep going up during the break. They're like rotten tomatoes up.

Speaker 1:          01:04:34       It's at a 99.9 and to do points. Yeah, no, it's at 99.9 and it's like, as you can get all like b minuses and still have 100% well that's fine. I mean, it's still a good measurement. It's like yes or no. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yes. And it's an emphatic, we all loved this peaches or sausages and we got all peaches baby. It's all peaches here by all features today. Um, how do we, where do we go from there? Um, I got some other stuff we could talk about what you want, man. Um, a lot of bullshit, Yada, Yada, Yada. Oh, here's something I do. I do. Oh, I got a button that does that. Okay. Pretty cool. Um, I saw you on the Green Room when you sat with all those Comedians, whatever. And you were the young guy and they were all like, look at this young guy, whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:05:30       But there was one detail about that. You don't wanna talk about it. It was fine. It was being an asshole. Well, anyway, I don't, I'm, I love Gary shandling. He's like, I have totally the bad news for you. Yeah. Wait, what is it? He's fine. He's living happily did. Yeah. Yes. Rest in peace. He would have liked that. Maybe the cellar doors slammed. I do know he's passed. So like, but I love so much this moment there when they introduced you and you're like, Hey, I'm from the new generation and I, and I was just wondering who are you guys? And I could tell a lot of them were, were rubbed the wrong way by that. A lot of the guys were like, specifically I thought like Mark Marin was like, look at this fucking kid, you know? Yeah. But whatever. But then garry shandling came out with this beautiful response of like, well that's so great that you say that because the feeling so mutual.

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       Yeah. Yeah. It was perfect. But not only was he perfectly funny, I feel like you, you weren't dear to him and that throughout the rest of it he was very supportive and very accepting of you and just really a sweetheart. Yeah. And I was, I'm just wondering if you had any other interactions with them. Yeah, I sort of had a relationship with them going forward. Like, um, that's what we like go over. Yeah. You play ball with him. I didn't, it was more just one on one, just going over there on weekends and like sitting with him for a while and he actually read the script of this movie is where the first really? Yeah. Wow. He's just super nice and super deep and kind and just as smart, just a deep kind person, which are just very cool and very like patient and open.

Speaker 1:          01:07:02       Um, but yeah, there's nothing worse than five comedians sitting around performing. I mean, it's so fucking, I don't know that, not that I ever being just mean like everyone tried to outdo each other. It's, so, I feel like that situation was something that I would hate to ever be involved in, just cause it's like so competitive. It has to be. Otherwise you just, if you don't want to compete to like prove how funny or witty you are, you just sit there like a fucking idiot doing bits in life. It gets very, very exhausting. Um, but that was a, that was actually kind of a fun one because I was so young and it was just like, so different than it felt like we could all just sorta fuck with each other a little bit. But, you know, um, you know, get Gary's dude. Good Dude. I love him.

Speaker 1:          01:07:48       I mean, well, okay. I don't. Okay, cool. We talked about that. Yeah. Great. He's a very zen eastern now he's such a Buddhist guy and like are you into that shit? I wish I was. You feel like you could be and I wish I was. Yeah, I keep trying, but then I never do like I bought a bunch of books and I'm like, I'll read those some day. Yeah. But as they say, it's in the buying that the, as they say, you just like put the verb first and you let the books in your shelf and they will by proximity man, who's stands lesson toilet get high on pot. Yeah. Right. Um, that was much better than one. I said. What was yours? It really didn't go anywhere at all. I don't know. I was a fifth grade thing I heard. Um, yeah. Anyway. Are you, are you Buddhist?

Speaker 1:          01:08:35       Are you into all of that, that you stern stuff? I'm more into the idea of religion than I was as a cool ass 19 year old atheist. You have come around not around. I just like, I don't really hold like it takes up so little of my mind criticizing it or no, you, you like felt, you felt when you were younger that need to be like, God dude. And now I'm like, ah, I mean whatever you get through the moment. I feel the same exact way. There's something about when you're young and you're like, I'm fucking so smart. I get this shit 80 it's like you think there's a guy in the sky? Yeah. It's like there are people a lot smarter than you that are religious so it isn't inherently a dumb idea. So it's like, what do you understand about the university little fucking idiot?

Speaker 1:          01:09:24       What do you understand about your own head? Yeah, I mean like, like that's the thing is that like the subjective experience. It's so mind blowingly impossible to understand that. Sure. God, you know what I mean? Like I don't do that. We're any of any of this is happening. God weirder than like anything that just existing, I don't believe in God necessarily, but I don't not believe in God. I believe in buying books about Buddhism and putting on my bookshelf. Yeah. Well we, we, we pray to the god of brick and mortar. Yeah. Um, did you go to a brick and mortar? Was it online? Online? Come on. I'm a home. Homesman exactly. You think I'd show up around a book store. Have you, when's the last time you went to a bookstore? I go to bookstores. I like to walk around a bookstore. Nice mom and pop shop like an Amazon books.

Speaker 1:          01:10:11       You know, the Amazon makes bookstores. Those are great. Real down to earth. Are you serious? Yeah. They have bookstore. Yeah. Yeah. They went and like just did you not have enough of the market? But they literally true. They literally destroyed bookstores and then like down and they're basically dancing the absolutely. No, no, no. They're like fucking their wives on their graves. I'm moving next door to like, Jeff's book starts like this just old fucking place. Yeah. Um, Amazon bookstores. I go to churches to, when I'm in the city, I'll go to a church and sit down. You'll sit down through the thing usually like on off hours because it's like, why do you go there? Do you pray? I'll see. Contemplating. Yeah. You find that the environment does something quiet. Well, the church I've been to churches and cathedrals and there's definitely a vibe, you know, it's great. It's like, and like you really can't be on your phone when you're in there. It's not even about God. It's almost just about like the quietness of like just being, there is something divine in existence. Let's just say agree we don't agree on, but let's just say I think that, but

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       like you really feel that there and it's like you don't have to believe in Jesus Christ. You don't have to look at a guy in a cross, but there's something divine about being alive and you feel that there. And like silence is as valuable as its ever been. Like silent attention is like so rare to get a less stimulation. Um, can I go to a church? I'm Jewish by gorgeous ethnicity. Yeah. If you don't mind, you're not going to help me out and can be like, somebody is not gonna be like you look a little Jewish. Can I see your id? Uh, he wouldn't say a little strange. Well he wouldn't come out that. So we've got, um, uh, thank you by the way. If you're cool with, you know, I think you might, I can't go to a synagogue. Hell yeah. Where I belong. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:56       It's party there. Um, but yeah, church is for everybody. I didn't know that. I think so. Is that what they say? No, but no, no. I think a lot of them, I like, my mom goes to like a Presbyterian whatever and the, the guy was like, anyone's welcome at this table if you're trans, if you're this, if it was like things are changing, things are changing. Can I talk about your mom? You have, your mom has a really interesting vocation. She a hospice nurse. Yeah. She'd been doing hospice. I mean stupid boss diminishes, which is basically she takes care of end of life. Yeah. And she works in a hospice center. So a lot of hospice nurses are out of how, you know, they'll go to, they'll go to a dying patient in their house, but the, this is where dying patients come and it's end of life care.

Speaker 2:          01:12:42       So the average day is two weeks, no one recovers. You know when you go there you do not leave. They are, see she sees three or four deaths a day. What is it, I'm curious just systematically how people end up there. Is it like a health insurance thing? Is it like a government thing? Um, that's a great question. Um, I mean it's, it's, it's when the dying process starts, I mean it's when the illness is fully move Oli terminal moving out of the hospital and into, into a place where it's called end of life care, where you're just trying to make them uncomfortable and think about how that came into exist. Is it part of the hospital? Like who runs that? I have no idea. I don't, that's Kinda like where did that come from? You know what I mean? Yeah. Um Huh. Cause most hospice is the specific out of institute.

Speaker 2:          01:13:35       Like, it's actually just nurses going to take care of you at home, so you're tying in your home. Um, this sort of thing. A hospice center is much, much rare, but no, it's a lot of donations and things. I mean like it's not just, you know, like a for profit place. Um, but yeah, it's pretty cool. How was that like, I mean, affected her and maybe even you by proxy, I mean surely that trickles down to you too as well. Yeah. I mean she's doing it nine or 10 years now and um, it's insane. You know, she, she have, after the first two weeks of working there, she forgot the president's name, so she went to the hospital to get a cat scan because she thought she had a brain tumor and she went to work the next day and her boss said, that just happens here and you just forget you, you're just going to be blocking so much of what's happening out here that it's con like that.

Speaker 2:          01:14:20       He's like, Oh, if you only told me, I would've told you that that happens to everybody here. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And like when she was getting ready to interview for the place, she saw like a body getting carried out. Like, I can't fucking do this. And then two weeks in she's carrying a body out, chatting with the nurse's assistant, puts in the car and turns around and it's like, whoa, crazy. And I'll be with her. Like a diner in a family will come up and be like, Patty, Patty, oh my God. Like, you know, cause she saw her, you know, they're, you know, father through his last two weeks of his life and they'll leave and she'll go, I don't remember them. It's like the most, she'll be some like the most important people in some people's lives for, you know, five of them a day.

Speaker 2:          01:15:01       And it's like, man, how does that affect her? It has their personality changes. She's incredibly stable and like it, it's all women. You know, it's like mostly all women there. And it's like, uh, it's like a really incredible example of like the sort of condescended stereotyped quality of, of women of like, Oh yeah, women are maternal and women are very caring, but it's like a, a like military, like as as tough a version of that is can be, and you actually realize that like caring is actually, is actually the most tough and resilient thing you can actually do at its extreme that I'm saying people come back from war, you know, unable to fucking process thoughts. My mother comes back from watching like a 40, 40 year old bleed out in front of his family and she comes to like, you know, smiles and cooks us dinner.

Speaker 2:          01:15:55       You know, like that is, that is actual strength, you know, and it, and it is, um, yeah, she's wild, wild stories. Wild that is, you know, people dying of alcoholism and she will dip a qtip and Jack Daniels and swab it and their mouth. Wow. You know, cause it's just, it's just people dying of lung cancer. She takes them out, she wields it out into the snow and holds a cigarette to their lips because they're two weeks. Eh, you know, cause it's just end of life care. It's not about they're venting and it's also very medical. She's also like a nurse practitioner. I mean she's a, she knows what she's worked in the Er, she's done these things. So, but um, yeah, it's wild. You know, that's gotta be one of the craziest fucking jobs you can possibly be for family members showing up. Like threatening to fucking kill people.

Speaker 2:          01:16:37       Like get my dad out of here. You shouldn't be what? I mean like, oh fucking not adding to terms with it or like they don't want them here or they're confused or they're, you know, it's, well I can say just from like my wife Isla is going through something with her dad right now and like just hearing her talking about it is like, it's so, it's just so fucked up. Like we're so bad at dealing with death, we don't think about it until it's there. And so like these women, these nurses that are, that are, were, are like such rocks for people because my mother will sit there and go like, she knows how to deal with it and she knows what it looks like. Like everybody, she knows how to deal with it and it's, and dealing with it as in like they make it easier.

Speaker 2:          01:17:19       But she, she'll, she, she can say like, she's never seen last words in her life ever. She says they almost, they almost never speak for the last two hours. There is a last breath, but there's almost never a last word. It's like really, really incredibly, incredibly fast. She was on an episode of, cause I talked a little bit about this on Marin's podcast like a long time ago and uh, Nancy Updike from this American life herd and they did it this American life. And on my ma, half of it's on my mom and you can hear her in the hospice center. It's, it's like, and some people, you know, it sucks for her because it's such an interesting job and of course it is emotionally taxing and she needs to talk about it, but it's like, it's such a hard thing to talk about because people care about and they go like, I just can't fucking hear that.

Speaker 2:          01:18:08       But it definitely puts, it puts my job in a perspective very easily. Yeah. Do you mean where I can just be like, oh, who gives a shit? What happens with, you know, this thing or that like, I just, I wonder if like we as a society and this kind of a fucking ridiculous question out there, but like if we just dealt with death better, you know what I mean? Like it's just, it's this buggy. We all obviously know we're going to die. But like the thought of it, the prepping of it, the Association of it, the way that, like we prolonging it, even when it's over like this, this is what this is, is that when people are dying and they're on death's bed certain to die and they're suffering, there's no quality of life. And, um, the family suffering, the person suffering, it's like you prolonged that for as long as possible.

Speaker 2:          01:18:50       I don't understand that. Yeah. I think we've done better with grief than we have death. You know what I mean? We, we, we, like, there's, there's more of an infrastructure for the grieving process, you know, I think, um, like we're, we're more familiar with that. I'm saying before, we may, like, we've experienced funerals, we know what that is, we know that space a little bit. Those are very public and right. Yeah. But the dying process for people unfamiliar with it is intense. And my grandfather, my father's father died at the hospice center my mom was working at, but she couldn't work with him because they don't let you work. Conflict of interest. Yeah. Yeah. Well the, the, there's interest, but like, yeah, just like fucked up. It's, uh, it's like, it just wouldn't be healthy or something. Yeah. And that, I mean, but yeah, like my mother will come home like having a rough day and it's like, what was it?

Speaker 2:          01:19:37       It's like, yeah, it was a young person, you know, it's like fucking ends. And it's in Massachusetts in like this beautiful, weird, centered, all of these windows. And like the seasons are changing and it's like, I would love to make a movie about it. It's just like a little too crazy and heavy. This subject matters is very interesting and I think it's something that really should be explored honestly. It's like, I wonder if there's a way to make it that isn't brutally depressing. You know what I mean? I know. I don't think there is, but could be beautifully depressing maybe. But like there's one story that she told me this like incredible. Um, one of her nurses aids, um, lots of immigrants that, that work there. And she, she was a Haitian immigrant and she was in the room holding something in her arms, in a towel. And My mother was working with, uh, older gentleman who was very sick and sort of out of it.

Speaker 2:          01:20:34       And My mother was like, um, so she's going to take care of you now. And the old guy said some racial slur, you know, this is a black woman. And it says like, I don't want that whatever touching me or getting near me. And mother turns to the nurse and she's like, you know, putting this stuff into him that like cox and out for a little bit so they can like change his bedding and everything. And my mom turns to the nurse's aide and like, you don't have to do this. Like he said, that's really inappropriate. You know, I'll do this, don't worry. And she's going, no, no, no, no, no, no holding singling. No, no, it's okay. It's okay. Okay. Like hearing all this and my mother watches is the guy I'm like dozes off for a bit and the woman opens the towel and she'd been warming lotion while he's saying all this stuff to her.

Speaker 2:          01:21:16       She was warming lotion for him and she's passed out sports and it gives him like, like works into his feet and his hands. That's after hearing her compassion. I, it's like incredible. It's like, you know, the, the, the people that do this are like true, truly angels and they're angels. And then you, I go to, you know, I go to the hospice center all the time to check in and, you know, seeing my mom and it's like a bunch of, you know, little Boston ladies being like, Oh, ball, you're out in the Hollywood. Oh my God, can we get, you know what I mean? They're like little, it's incredible. It's, it's a, it's, it's a crazy little world. There, there was, there was, I think it was an hbo show about it. Um, I never saw it, but moving, I would definitely love to watch anything about that.

Speaker 2:          01:21:58       It's just, I think a documentary, I'd be the best. I mean, I you, the respect of the family makes it because you couldn't really do it, but I, right. That you should listen to. It's called death and taxes. The, this American life. I'll check it. Pretty incredible. Love it. Love that show. Um, well thanks for sharing that. Yeah. Do you, well, let's, so let's switch gear and please, um, you know, I used to do this thing at the end of our show. We used to ask people if that goes stories. But frankly I don't, I'd rather do something else with you. Okay. Can I, yeah, I don't, yeah, I didn't think you would. And I frankly don't either. I don't even know why it's still going on. It's like, do you have ghost stories? They're like, no. It was like, yeah, I don't either. Like our fans got into this thing about ghost stories and I'm like, I don't, I don't believe in ghosts. You guys, regardless, I'm want to do a new thing, which is that I've werewolf stories. Um, I find the perfect video to watch with my guest. Hell yeah. To close up the show. And I think I found the perfect video to watch with the, okay. So first of all, let me hit you with one of these. Okay. Now Bo in the house

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       is a origin meme. It's kind of one of our earliest and best music, I would say in reaction to one of the best videos on the Internet. Um, it's Papa John. Yeah, I actually do remember this. You know the Papa John's do. I do remember that. This is the tour of his house, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I haven't seen this a little, so I thought we'd watch it together. Know I do have the name of some like asshole. You mean like some asshole kid? Well, there was no like you saw Chris Southern quarter ballot be oh, oh, he's being, you know how this motherfucker's spells his name? You do. You just said it. I was like that. My French fucking bright. Yeah, no, no. Yeah, of course not. I feel bad for him in a way though. He probably got his ass beat in high school though. Oh, well the good thing.

Speaker 1:          01:23:49       Well, it's not like we're bringing them up and eat again to be shamed publicly in front of thousands. Well, he's just, he's grown up. He's come to terms with the pizza man. His Dad is kind of taking the heat off him. Like I say that his dad is, I like it was on a conference call. Yeah, he dropped the n bomb pop. It doesn't have the best track record. Yeah. Yeah. So hoppa John, man, I love Papa John. He's like, he's just got so high curls. Oh, we got that hot, luxurious by, you know what I always say about Papa John? He looks like a hammerhead shark. He, nope. That's not what I say, but I like it. It looks like he's too close to a pizza oven for too long, because you know what I mean? Like let's pull up a zap of Papa John here. Let's give you guys the whole lore overview before we, before we dive in head first year.

Speaker 1:          01:24:40       No, I don't want Google to know my fucking location. He always looks a little wet. That is what I mean. Like the cheese is melted on his face. Yeah. He looks like that pizza is a little overcooked. You know what I'm saying? Right. Yeah. He looks like just, it's not, it looks like he's own wax sculpture. That's right. That's, that's a good way to put it. He's clearly had some work, but man, nothing can fix man. That left eye is nothing. Trying to look at someone else. Nothing could have fixed. Look at those brows, Bro. Couple pepperoni's look at this. Danny Zuko Curley's trying to rock up top and like, I mean that like, I will say to his credit, he's an incredible, he's, he really was a guy with the pizza joint. The grew it out of nowhere. Yeah. Well you know what? Some pizza joints got to work.

Speaker 1:          01:25:30       So here, let me show you this. I mean, wait, it's Papa John's the one with the garlic sauce. Yeah. It's actually pretty good. I Love Papa John's. It started from a real place. This whole papa bless it started from a real place of, of love for Boppa. You know what I mean? Uh, he various shit faced. Yeah. I mean, here you go. Just get it close up. Yeah. He's got a real nineties magician vibe, right? Yeah. Like a, remember those shows on ABC where the guy would wear white mask and expose all the time. I love that magician at home. It'd be like, what the fuck dude, that was him, the one ingredient home line. Uh, but what was it I wanted to show you? Oh, I don't know if there's so much papa John Content does show you. Papa is in the house. Is Really, they should is nuts.

Speaker 1:          01:26:23       Not this is like a separate computer just for this. Right. I would like never broadcast my, my, my browser. I was like be terrifying. So no, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes. Yeah. My related video, you'd be like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. No, no, no, no, no. This is just for here baby. I'm all good. No history on this one. Yeah. It's like a destiny's child feet that was giving. No, I feel you man. I'm here. This is the one I wanted to show you. Just the beginning. They staged this whole ridiculous promotional thing and I love how he thinks he's like a celebrity. Like he's a pizza celebrity. You know what I mean? It's a shit. Oh, hey. You know what though? He's spoken into existence, man. Yeah. He wanted to be committed, became it. He dead. Well not probably not what he wanted, but he did become something in the higher they climb, the harder they fall. Very true. So, um, anyway, they went and set this whole thing up. Like he's supposed to go to this culinary school and teaching people how to make a pizza. But it's so obviously fake. I mean, but he has people, I mean, just enjoy this.

Speaker 1:          01:27:40       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:27:43       everyone's got paper plates

Speaker 1:          01:27:53       and the host is just the most flattering cock sucking judge Jack. I just got this. It's, it's cannot be overused. That's incredible. All right. I get to the fucking point. I liked this. I liked this part in the show or were like already hour and a half in. So now it's like nobody's really watching. Yeah. Great. Right. So it's like the pressure is really off at this point. This guy's the c o of Secrets of Louisville shifts. So apparently it's pr. It's a series

Speaker 5:          01:28:37       right here. Is this not like a, just like a fever dream does it? It feels like Tim and Eric. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. The mural

Speaker 1:          01:28:48       and insane in the back. Hold on you. He's got a Lav and they don't mute it so you can hear him making these really weird sounds like he goes like, whoa. And Shit like that, but we lose it.

Speaker 5:          01:29:01       Hey, hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:29:06       Oh my God. It was, you know, listen to, this shit is incredible. I somehow, I've never made a video about this because, oh, there's only a few wonderful moments like this, but the rest is just so boring. No, no, it's not worth it. No, but this is beautiful. And like 93,000 is truly under the radar. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Um, I'm sure they put a lot of marketing in this, but here,

Speaker 5:          01:29:29       oh, I need to go back one

Speaker 1:          01:29:32       very exciting what's going on there? But can we stop for that?

Speaker 1:          01:29:43       I mean, he is like the, it's, it's lesson. He's Papa John. Sometimes. That's enough. It wasn't enough. When was, it was yesterday and all the shit went down, right? Yeah. It's weird little fucking, he's, the public doesn't ask. He does not have the best track record. He, he was, when it was in the news first one, he was like, I'm not gonna fucking increase my pizza prices by 1 cent to give my employees healthcare because of obamacare. They were like, you've cheap fucking right John. I mean if, if, if the CEO's of our pain or celebrity ceos of our pizza chain restaurants can't survive the current cultural moment, who can, yeah. I feel like I'm next and you know what the thing is, it's like what are we gonna have to get into a fucking him or whatever, but like we have to take him so seriously.

Speaker 1:          01:30:37       Cause it's like, it's kind of like he could be president, so we just only like literally we have to take them seriously. But yeah, we actually have to be worried about this, that like that's the problem with the culture and I want to get into all that shit you know? Mean. But like what's insane is that like, ev, the entire culture exists on the same level and on that same plane and it, and it mimics our fucking phones. It's like you scroll through your twitter and you will, or your instagram and you will see in no particular order, your mother, your friend Geico, the president of the United States, Kim Kardashians. And it's like, and that's what the national conversation has become. Like, it's just all the same. It's like when Kanye freaked out, we have to take them seriously. Cause like w what's the fucking difference there?

Speaker 1:          01:31:16       There is only one conversation being yeah, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. It's like yeah it kind of like we, I would just be like yeah fuck this guy. But it's like no like we have to actually keep an eye on our pizza guys cause they may run the fucking world. I gets crazy. Yeah. No I think that's true. Well and similarly he got in trouble when he'd said that the NFL people and you stop protesting because it's affecting pizza prices. Did you see it? That whole thing when the kneeling nfl player are yeah, nfl. And he was like listen, I'm going to pull my sponsors. He was like their number one sponsor and if these guys keeping yelling because our pizza sales are down since they started protesting, that's crazy. And the kneeling thing is like I personally am publicly have, I've always been like what is it?

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       Why do you fucking care? But also like, don't we know that like the Department of Defense pays like $50 million like that? All the flag shit is advertisements for the military. The Department of Defense pays the NFL like, Whoa, why pay them to do this? All the other reuniting troops and stuff, those are paid paid stage things too. That's fuck. So like, no wonder they're angry obviously, because like you're, it's not that like you're kneeling during the anthem. It's like, no, no, you're kneeling during our ad time. Disparaging are, are, no, this is the answer. Yeah. Yeah. No, this is a, we paid for this shit to be an advertisement and your d, that's a fucking great advertisement. That is exactly the people that go sign up. Yeah. And like, and like chill, whatever. I mean, I think it should be stated. You mean like I'm saying, I don't think whatever does it, the FCC have rules.

Speaker 1:          01:32:49       Like I as a youtuber need to disclose what I'm sponsored, the military sponsor of the NFL and nobody needs to be like, hey, this is a page. This national anthem is a paid sponsorship. Yeah. It's slats fucking creepy. Crazy. Yeah. Um, well, yeah, I mean, oh, well let's get them off the field. And that case, I didn't know they were disparaging a sponsor. Yeah, exactly. Now we got a problem. Yeah, yeah. Well anyway, can we please acknowledge the, it's too good, but know, but that is truly, that is what I searched for it. It's like the micro moments of those systems, a beautiful micro moment and boom goes, the dynamite is so good because it's like it's one after another point that very well, I think it goes the dynamite did he coined that? I don't know. It's his now. I mean if he coined that then, but that's what's so sad about is he's flailing and then in the Lebanese it's back to the thing that he wanted to say if it went well, which is going goes to nine at night.

Speaker 1:          01:33:46       But yeah, it's like I said, what do you feel for pup right now? Do you sympathize with them? No. Okay. No, no, no. It's like, try to sympathize with this man. It's hilarious. I just can't believe like, I just can't believe where the headlines look like. Yeah. It's like Papa John, I'm trying to, it's crazy droplet Papa John, drop the n bomb on conference call with the board of directors. Yeah, and you're like, yeah and that should be funny or weird or like I'm saying it should be like some weird face off and not look indistinguishable from like geopolitical headlines. I totally hear you. I think it will be, I have this problem with twitter news, which I love twitter news. It's almost like, it's like a fucking ivy of all this bullshit right into my vein. I don't almost use twitter at all. Just the news. Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. Album is like, what happened was Shane Dawson, somebody just added the blue. Well what was it? Then they accused him of being a pedophile or some shit. What was it? But it was just like so unfounded and they ran it as this headline and I was like, damn, that shouldn't be, you know, like you said next to, to the point where he said he was getting like a cost at starbucks and stuff. Right. Like just because some asshole blast it on there.

Speaker 1:          01:35:07       Let's not, let's not veer off too far, but no, but it's incredible to talk about the dangers of the Internet while also showcasing them bite during hip saying, yeah, I mean this thing is so fucking awesome. Look at this. It's got pictures. Yeah. I'm very excited about that. And you can customize it. I've got another one. I mean we, I mean this is just the beginning, like, yeah, I'm gonna have a lot of fun with it. I get, I get this for you. Want to do it. Okay, cool. Enjoy. Um, so, um, let's, let's venture forth bravely if, if we may, oh, we're doing this still. Yeah. Okay. This is why I brought you here.

Speaker 1:          01:35:55       You want to talk about your movie gone clearly, but the pizzas fucking good. Like you could say, oh, oh, wagner was a Nazi. You could bog and it was a Nazi, but like his music was pretty Dang. Dang is the word. I think he was hoping people would think it was. Dang. Yeah. I mean it's, you know, the chick filet thing, it's like those sandwiches pretty good. Pretty fucking. Dang. Well that's the conversation. Can we separate the art from the pizza mogul? Can we separate the two? The garlic sauce from the what looks like water logged young vampire, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's a good description. I like that. Some stuff, some rumor that the garlic sauce is the secret of, of of his loss of his long life. Is that right? Yeah, it's like a slight more, it's probably quite the opposite for everyone else.

Speaker 1:          01:36:49       You think he's, he doesn't drink that garlic sauce. I drink it. You do fucking, I throw the pizza out. I drink that shit. No you don't. They're in school. I used to need in that in school we used to, um, I get like fifth grade we would line up shots of a Russian dressing, like we do dress. Did you like the dressing or was it meant to be gross? It was like at that age where it's like there's no, you're not doing drugs and stuff, so you're like getting it to cassie. Yeah. Gimme like sweet or there was one friend we used to pay to eat anything weird like, and he was up for anything that reminds me of that. Ethan. Any fucking thing I'm telling you, Bro?

Well, to be frank, that may be the grossest one. Yeah. Who? Dollar earners. I had friends. These do poo dollar. Oh, was that you put poo on a dollar and you leave it outside like Oh yes. And was like a dollar. Yeah. And then there's the shit on it, but it's like, it was a lot of jackass. That was a big part of my childhood. I met Cityville sweet guy. Oh, he was on here.
