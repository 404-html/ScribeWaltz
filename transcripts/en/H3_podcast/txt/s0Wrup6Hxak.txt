Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Welcome everybody. We are back the h three podcast, episode 100. I got to tell you, I wasn't sure we'd make it to 100. We had a bumpy road. We had some ups, we had some downs. We have some goose, we have some laughs, we had some booths, but here we are for better or worse episode for better 100. Here we are. We soldiered on. First of all, thank you to our sponsors, stamps.com. Me undies 23. Me Twenty three and me and dollar shave club now. Today is also very coincidentally the last episode of the year which happens so perfectly. I was going to lie and say it was episode 100 today just so we could hit that milestone, but I didn't need the lie. It was episode 100. He actually was that. I was in the car. It's just going to skip 99 so we're going to skip that and just be like, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       You guys are talking about but magically it's episode 100. We have so much a look back on. So today what we're going to do, and I think is going to be a lot of fun, is I'm going to bring in and Dan out, we're going to all sit here and share our favorite and our worst moments of the first 100 episodes because think back to our first episode was Pewdie Pie sitting in his rental house in La and you, you look, well we weren't live streaming for like the first 10 or 15 episodes. It was like eight. And we had like a really weird desk here that one and the guests would sit on this purple couch. It was very strange, but the big breakthrough I think came for us when we started live streaming it. And when we got this table Ed, we started to feel the format more.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       And obviously I'm still developing a lot. Um, God, please, please God let there be room to grow. We haven't. You always said that the rule is the first hundred or you don't know what you're doing until the first hundred episodes. That's what, that's what I say. And, and kind of a master now, please God, let that be true. No, there's, there's been so much to learn. Someone said that you don't know until the 2:50 episodes. Yeah, we gotta we gotta push that back because now that we're at $100, the pressure's on. I heard Joe Rogan say you don't know until a thousand, so I think we still have a lot of room to go. Um, so we're going to bring everyone out. We've got a ton of great things to look back on it. I mean, we've been doing this for two years. It took us two years to get to 100 episodes.

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       There's a lot of great moments that I forgot even happened that we're going to look over. Um, so I can't wait. I'm super excited and just everyone who's tuned in and stuck around for this wild. I thank you so much. It's been an incredible journey here and I'm looking forward to getting to that. But before we do, we had our huge charity stream on Tuesday, which we streamed for eight and a half hours the longest day of my life. Still recovering from that. That was absolutely brutal. And against all odds we hit $100,000 live. Hell yeah. Couldn't believe it. I had to live because I was sick. I'm still kind of sick. But um, I got home and I think you just raised to 75 and I him, that's it. You guys were going to leave. But Justin was like, no way. I'm not 100.

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       And then it happened pretty fast. Like I couldn't believe it. Um, why is it not letting me sign into my, you need permission from Ethan? I'm, I am Ethan sign into while letting me log into this stats at any word with this email and I'll get you. So at any rate we uh, well yeah, because I could tell first of all, Zach, our sound guy had a finals the next day. Everyone was, they got here before us. I was like, they were, they were here for like 15 hours that day. And so everyone was getting tired and I was like, all right, we can't, you know. But, but justin pushed us on and it was so good that he did. Yeah, we hit it. Okay, here we go. I got access, so let's say I want to go over some stats. I'm, I'm very, I'm always fascinated by what reward item raised the most money because it's always unexpected and by the way, this is still up for another 10 days so you can still bid, you can still donate and help out a great cause like in the description in the description.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       So top donors, I got say we inched out Alex for 100 bucks because they, you ula donating from home, you donated 400 from home and we got there now there are so many super generous people here. I'm going to out Justin. That was justin. That was very generous of him. Alex was very generous. James Wayne Hoff donated a 2000. 100 will cheer up. Donated 2000. I mean so many more. Sookay the channel. Yeah, we had him. He was chilling on the background. Yeah. And then we're going to take a call who's calling in later today? A fifths. Just a few more down on that list. God bless him. So button at a time on Tuesday, but we'll, we'll speak to him later in the episode. Here's the real interesting stuff. So of all the rewards here is what raised the most money and again you can bid on all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       Okay. Get the heck out of here. This pivot table. So most of all was nothing. These generous and efforts, everything like I was $26,000 from the kindness of my heart. Yeah. Pretty amazing. And then Alex crushed what that limited edition a. The Journal, the Journal raise $12,000. So this, I love the Nintendo switch coming in a $300 investment. We bought one of every gaming system, a switch, a ps four, an xbox and together combined. And that was a last minute idea over years, right? Uh, yeah that was good one. So that 1200 bucks raised $20,000. That was the best fricking return. Authentic whenever. But the switch raise 9,000. That's so cool. Post Guitar, I'm happy to see raised $8,300, right? Something on Ethan's food book. God bless rick and morty script lots of original art hugging it out. Oh, I think I put a thousand on that one. God, I hope I get it. People are gonna. Think it's a rigged. If I get it though, what do we do about that? It's random, but then there's so many, but the really guys, I want to encourage everybody to keep donating because if you go down to the bottom, a lot of the original art that we drew towards the end, they didn't get that many donations.

Yeah, I think we've just broke that uh, right before going live. Cool. Continues to climb. Good. And also it's such a tough time for people with the Christmas holiday gifting and so people are really generous and that sounds very generous

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       and I want to say because I'm afraid I didn't emphasize it enough during because it was focused on getting the call, I was like, please let me go home. No, every dollar matters. And to everyone, everyone who even dropped $1 to help is just, it makes a big difference. It's super generous and it's very much appreciate it. It's a beautiful thing and it's tax deductible. I don't know how much a $1 tax deduction will get you, but you know, hey, mark it off. Like you said, every bit counts. You know, Benjamin Button said a penny. A dollar deducted is a dollar earned a button. Yeah, Benjamin Franklin, I believe it was the one that did a little remix. Alright, well enough of that shit. Let's get on to our favorite moments of 2018. So I would like to welcome, I'm the other half of the show with whom it would not be possible and who I want to say Dan and Ian come in here. I'd like to say have truly been a blessing to the show. I want to say that their presence has made such a difference and add is so much presence. Ian Bring so much character to the show with his powerpoint. Do we have a powerpoint today?

Speaker 3:          00:10:17       Fire? No.

Speaker 2:          00:10:22       Ian and Dan, please join us. We couldn't do. We couldn't do a year end recap without these two guys. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:10:32       so what's going on? But yeah, what happened when that Kanya decoding? We were so slammed this week and with the teddy fresh stuff too, it was like I didn't have enough time and has been doing all of our customer support emails. By the way, if you ever complained, you're talking to not talking to a robot. Nope. That's it. That's literally a slab. That celebrity is answering your question. Yep. So if you hit me with a, you know, fuck you. That's right here. It feels waco. You got the first fuck you on supply. You did. I'll tell me about that. Go on. I didn't hear about. Oh yeah, you were out here and tell me everything. Well, yeah, I mean people go, you know, it's holidays, heated, very time sensitive. How did you take it? Did you take a person who could instruct? Well, I exploded on him. Flipped out. No. Listen Buddy, you know, it happened.

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       Well, there's been a lot of delays and uh, unfortunately there's a lot of packages getting delayed. Well just remember it's Ian's fault so you this female, but the truth is we're trying to get you out of the trenches there because you're a creative, you're brilliant guy and I need that. A big beautiful brain Ahmedi brain of yours working in my benefit by decoding stuff. I need to, I need to squeeze that valuable Jews that it is worth.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       And Dan has been with us longer than anyone. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Um, it's crazy how times past, but here we are. Um, and we'll, let's talk about our favorite moments now. How should we do this? I've got a bunch of mine. Maybe I'll go. Do you think they should present first? Because I have a shit ton. You guys have less than me now. Well you have like the general stuff stuff that came from fans. Yeah, I've got, I've got it all. Let's do those first. So this is everything from the first 100 episodes now. Joey Salads from the last charity stream. This will always go down as one of my favorite moments and as history. Now the backstory of this is that, um, because at the time we weren't really equipped to live stream, so joey salads live streamed it from his phone on his personal twitch gentle that went across the street from the office and we, yeah, we watched it with a delay but we had them on the phone so we were hearing the audio through the phone and then watching his stream which made it better because we heard the screaming about 15, 20 seconds before the impact.

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       And I love how just so casually and calmly, Justin has accepted the bird pepper spraying jelly south. He loves it. He had no hesitation, just seemed there. This was the legendary moment. And um, and funnily Joey Salads was banned from twitter for doing a dangerous act. But, but art fine. Oh, poor guy. I think he was three a reinstated. Sorry, joy. Without further ado,

Speaker 5:          00:13:49       who was recording? What was it like being there? Seeing that this was like, I've only been here a couple of weeks at the time and I remember I called my mom after I was like a guy just got pepper spray work. You afraid that it will reach, you know, you didn't feel it. I kept the distance. And so to this day Joe says that was infinitely worse than a spicy pepper trying to help you guys. Kept it real professional. Ian's following the action camera work. It's Kinda like when you're filming like a wildlife shot and like a, like a gator is attacking a deer and you can intervene and save the day. No, just watch the pain nature play on

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Star Trek. The rules of a non intervention. It's the first protocol, the first prime directive. There you go. Ian had a prime directive and you wonder how could we top it next year, but we're going to have to throw them off a building. We kinda, yeah, that's sort of an issue because um, we, we went for broke on that first one and then because joey got a got banned as a result, were a little reluctant to go that far again? Well, I didn't know what happened, but I wanted to shoot him with a nonlethal been back, but I was like, that's not, that's not gonna fly. So we have to. The thing about the spicy peppers that even though it's very painful, it's not necessarily dangerous. So Youtube doesn't see it as like a bantible fence. So if we can get a professional stuntman and like a safety crew, we may be able to throw them off a building. Maybe next time we can get some submissions because I get some ideas. We have a year lot of people listening and next up buggy. Now buggy is such an incredible guests because he always, he doesn't hold back and he has a, he had a story on his last visit about dating a feeder. Just such a pleasure. Such a pleasure. And so here we go. She, oh she like,

Speaker 6:          00:16:14       come in and I'm so sorry to say this, this is great cookies and she's laid them across your chest, down her stomach to make an arrow to her vagina. And then she had filled her Vagina Maraschino cherries for dessert. Swear to God. And my first thought is, you are going to get a yeast infection. What the fuck are you doing? Like don't put food in your vagina. How many of you stuffed in there? Six or seven. I was like, you know what I was experiencing in my life. I was like, this is awesome. And then do what you gotta do it. Yeah, no, this was news to me out. Yes, quite, quite, quite literally. And, and, uh, and then we've been together for awhile and then I got sick. I got like an infection in my leg, which is like real frequent. I get in with the Olympic team all the time and I'm like, I gotta go to the hospital. She was like, they're going to make you lose weight. And I'm like, no, no, no, that's going to be fine. I go into the store to go to the hospital and I'm like, mom, what are really. Fuck you. Okay. We're done. Like, I'm not going to die. She's faking the infection. How do you fake an infection? What do you pitch was twisted?

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       I mean, well, what's, you know, what ultimately is the goal of feeding someone the, that that leads to death. That's the one path. But uh, what was it mentioned in this highlight is that he did eat the cherries out of,

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       of her agenda. What a guy. What a legend. Yeah, I love that. I like the, on the highlight. There was a comment from some guy saying, lady, if you're watching this video, I'm 300 pounds. I put on weight. I don't know if green Japan's qualifies yet because Mcgee said he was at like 500. That's right. But I guess he's got lots of ways to go have a for feeder. There's a lot. It's a long road to go together. Um, oh this. Now this one I completely forgot. This was submitted by a fan and this is when we had ty Lopez on the cloud guys. And we got him good because we had this video where we went to his house and he had a lawyer's, a troop of lawyers following me the whole time. We decided to get him back when he came on our own podcast and we hired an extra that you found on craigslist, right then?

Speaker 4:          00:18:41       Uh, yeah. Well I didn't actually. Craigslist, we all forgot that we did that one. We saw the submission saying, how'd you, how'd you find them? How to do, what'd you mark put up? Just need an actor for one day for like an hour. I got a lot of weird people so that was a little but kind of comb through it. And then he was very game. We like put them in the closet because you never know what you're going to get with craigslist. Especially actors are already all weird and craigslist senators bottom. But you, you hit the Jackpot with that guy because he was, the guy was, he played it completely straight. It was amazing. He sat in our tiny little closet room for like an hour at least just because we're like, just being there, need to use the bathroom, go do it quick because you can't come back.

Speaker 4:          00:19:34       He was so game to totally cool, but what did we pay them? Do you remember? I don't. I don't remember. Probably probably more than girls get for kissing. Prank almost started a couple of hundred. I mean it was an easy day for him. A couple hours after he had a couple of hours. I remember afterwards then he was like, I know that guy. He recognized, ah, I've seen his ass all over youtube. Yeah, exactly. So here it is. This is. I watched this this morning. I was like, oh my God, this is brilliant. And he plays. It is so straight to like you say, wow, that's noticeably flushed and walked down there. I love that shot. How do we set the camera up? Look at Thai. I took, I took a picture out the window one hour or two hours before. Right event that festival. Completely ignoring what was happening. Yeah. Crazy world wants to look at the world and he keeps imposing on him. You, uh, you recently I was speaking at a conference well to

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       entrepreneurs', wanting to scale their business for me. Just can you just bring a little bit closer? I just want you to miss anything.

Speaker 5:          00:20:57       Did you bring your lawyer? Don't worry about he's not. He's like an intern that's going to read me my miranda rights. Don't just try not to think about it. No, I'm just kidding. He's got that. He's got that lawyer getting the eyes. Oh my God. He's scaring me. You're starting to scare me now. So thanks for your service to us. Very well done. By the way. Lots of intimidation there is going to serve me.

Speaker 1:          00:21:45       And now another favorite V set. Our first bank ever. Like kind of a frank. Really early episode. I want to say ty was like 16. 17 was pretty early. Yeah. Really it was. It doesn't feel that long ago. Now that I see it, but Tai Lopez was a year ago. Let's see this one or a number. Thirty three little higher. Um, October fourth. So it was over a year, over a year. What is this cold open? The new episode of the Eighth Street. What does this look at? This shit. Whenever we ever started the podcast starring your boy. I remember when he had attorneys to explained that. Yeah, that's cute. Wasn't this live? Might've prerecorded. It was prerecorded. Yeah. The SOS. Michael here. One of my all time favorite guests. Another guy is an open book. He's hilarious. We talked to him about taking Iowasca, which is a psychedelic drug.

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       Yes it is. And I thought it was a wonderful conversation by the way. I just realized that Dan is here. It tells us about break time. Oh, it was telling us about. Oh, is it break? I've been keeping an eye on the clock to 3:45 will be 30 minutes late. Vsauce is coming back our first episode back 25th of January. We'll, we'll be joined by vsauce again. So I'm very much looking forward to that. But here he talks about taking a psychedelic drug, um, which is just the combination of him, psychedelics and youtube red is just. I love that. Those three things together is not something you would expect that he had a lot of interesting things to say.

Speaker 5:          00:23:35       Here's the thing. My heart was going. It was literally beating very fast. I actually, there's a moment where I touch my chest. I'm like, Yep, that's really happening. But then I thought, how do I let the doctor know? Because

Speaker 7:          00:23:45       I can't think, no, this is not how I normally feel. Is it weird if I just say, Hey, I'm help, how are they going to interpret that? And so I just, I thought maybe I'll just ask for water, you know, maybe that like will tether me back down to reality because someone will have to bring me water. And that's a really. I've been there. I feel like I've been in that headspace of training.

Speaker 2:          00:24:08       They're like, I don't want to see me talk. But um, that was great. Love vsauce talking about that too, because he was so analytical about his experience, which you know it most people who do that are looking for some sort of spiritual connection and he was more just trying to like appreciate what was happening to him the entire time. It was really cool to hear him talk about it. Yeah, I would, I would, I would like to just put Michael in a room and just give them all kinds of drugs and just, Oh yeah, record him. Let's get that set up for the 25th. I mean the new micro. Here's a Mtma will leave, you know, tell us how you feel the new season is out. I'm very much looking forward to. Oh, nice. Now we're going to talk all about that on the 25th now. Now garth brooks is somewhat of a phenomenon here and on other podcasts as well because he's just such a legend and there's one video specifically of Garth's that I love where he goes. He's sitting in his hotel room. Why don't I, why don't we just watch it was, I honestly can't. I can't watch this too many times. Garth Brooks face, right? Um, I can't watch this video too many times. It's truly a masterpiece.

Speaker 7:          00:25:20       Well, I guess it's official. We're now on facebook. I really wasn't sure about this to start, but then a friend of mine said something they just made also. She said think of it more as a conversation, but I'm already finding out on my own. So it's wiping the walls out between you and me. And I really liked that. It allows us into each other's world.

Speaker 2:          00:25:43       Good. The, uh, title Garth Brooks, first facebook post and video. Amazing. Authentic and transparent. One hundred percent. That's funny because when I watched this, I see like the opposite

Speaker 7:          00:25:57       my case. Oh, tell me about. This. Reminds me of title

Speaker 2:          00:26:01       in, in my garage video in that it tries to look authentic and natural, but you know, he's done it a thousand dollars. Take 40, you'd lose for sure. Looks like the type of video you'd make from the bunker after the bombs have fallen. I really like that. You know, it'd be fun is to just maybe do like a go fund me and then run this as a youtube provable. Go find me for people to donate and then you use all that money as a, as a community and you use this as a youtube pre roll so people just get this video. Oh a go fund me to pay to have this as an APP. So it's just constantly popping up. That's kind of. That's good. I mean it's, he's not selling anything but I wonder if you get pissed or if you'd loved that. I really liked that. Be like, what the fuck? I mean, that'd be great. Let's try it to go fund me.

Speaker 7:          00:26:57       Think about things I want to post to post cool stuff, slick stuff, neat stuff, but most of the stuff I'm going to post it gonna be raw stuff like this. That's just who I am. Truly a conversation tonight. Nice. They let the conversation begin

Speaker 2:          00:27:15       and iconically after saying, let the conversation begin and was the last video he ever poked? Say let the compensation and incredible stuff. I'd never seen that until you showed it to me and know I find myself doing that like that. I liked helping people think you're being strange because they don't. Oh, I've done the without a doubt. That happens to me a lot. We used to watch it so many times, but we didn't know what to do with it. Like, yeah, I know but. But it's wallet. It was somewhat underground, but I think a lot of people are picking up on it now. But the great moment, one of my favorite moments was we had Chris Delea on and I saw that he was a garth brooks fan and the similar sense that I was right and I says to him, I pitched him this idea, you, I go, you know what I want to do, I want to recreate this video word for word and just post it. And he's like, I think I've done that. Right? So here. And we discovered that he did it and he didn't even remember or recreate it. I want to upload this to my youtube channel on edited. I think. I think I did this. You did. You recreated it. I know, I know. I sent the video to grow your role. I know I sent it to Joe, Bryan County. I don't know if I ever uploaded it.

Speaker 5:          00:28:43       700 views. It was some random person, but somehow it's just five months. Not even that long ago. Oh yeah. So somebody found him first. I really wasn't sure about this start. Oh, so a friend of mine and I will say this,

Speaker 2:          00:29:06       I, I didn't write it down. I watched it.

Speaker 5:          00:29:11       Hi, this is from A. I remember I remember it. Substrate feeling and authenticity. Yeah. I really liked that. Has 50,000 different spray while saying that this exists brought up. You thought you bring it up. I'm like, Bro. I'm like, well, you're in a hotel room. Right? Right, right. Yeah. Come on, I'm immersed. I guess it's official. Ron facebook really wasn't sure about this, but did. A friend of mine said something that made all kinds of sense. She said, just think of it as a conversation. I like that one. I'm already noticing myself is that it's wiping away the walls of communication between you and me. Well, I really liked that line. Is an invitation to fuck. Fuck, fuck. I think facebook wise. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Everybody can see this each other's worlds, or in my case, my hotel room, one of the cool stuff, slick stuff, neat stuff, but I'm probably gonna end up posting stuff like this because it's who I am. Well, I guess if this is a conversation, then I say lit. The conversation began. I

We are here to celebrate the 100th episode of the podcast and look fondly back hard. Um, where was I posted? Malone? Never heard of. Always a favorite. Always a treasure to have them on. But during, was it his last appearance? I think so. Um, there was the live show after that. So yes, um, during one of his appearances here, Patrice Wilson started live streaming some really creepy stuff that seemed to be directed towards me and we were watching this unfold live and it was very spooky. So he, so he started broadcasting just a shower curtain. Three x three was in the title. Exactly. And so we'll look for yourself.

Speaker 4:          00:39:09       Yeah. Oh God, I'm scared. What is that creepy fucking screens, dude? I have chosen. I didn't know there was so creepy. It's like a CD screen, like a screen with a gun in it. He was just moving behind it. No, this is not a screen that scared the shit out. Turn this off. So we were all getting, we were all getting the.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       Yeah. Uh, Patrice Wilson is already a guy that's just a little strange. That's fair. I think in the fairway, but I just thought it really scared the shit out of me when I saw this and it. And it continues. So, so this happened early on in the episode and we closed it. We're like, all right, we can't have. This is way too scary. And later on the live chat was saying he's back and it's changed and this part really scared the shit out of me. Here you have it.

Speaker 4:          00:40:19       He's got a countdown timer, a graveyard posts in a cemetery. Griffey I love you. Goodbye. Goodbye. I'll spend the night with you. Well, I'm worried about December first. That's what I'm saying. On December first, let's do a getaway. I don't want to be in la because he's here. Fuck that. Let's just hold up with some shot. He's fucking. I've room in your house. There's not. It's a very vulnerable and it makes me very vulnerable. And you can attack from anyone here who knows the way worse now I've got a defensible high ground

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       when the time clock and ended, we left the house. We didn't want to be in the house just in case I want you hiding in a grocery store park. So when the time when we got down to zero, it was getting more provocative and more threatening. I felt. And I felt so unsafe in our last house as well that I was like. And we just had got. Do we have shutter at the time? I was really scared for shredder and so we, we packed up, we got shredder, we went in the car and we just drove into a public parking lot and just held up for a couple of hours because I was like, look, I don't fucking know you guys up to at all. No, I would have done at least that town for the day. But then patrice was like, why did everyone think this was creepy? Rolling through a cemetery.

Speaker 1:          00:41:57       There was even more heat directly addressed to you at some point. Yeah. He was like, I'm coming for you. And like, yeah, no, I know. I know. Um, that was a wild one, but it was special. We shared it with post live and it was a beautiful moment. It's just one of many, uh, Jordan Peterson hits the vape God. Now there's an internal debate and this office, because we have retired, the vape God. And I think for guests like Jordan Peterson is so fantastic to have them hit it, but isla hosted opinion and she's not necessarily wrong that it's really disgusting and weird requests, but you know, and I, I appreciate that. She thinks it's dirty, but we keep it clean, don't we? Oh sure. What you cleaned. Yeah. I and there's not much. Yeah, I mean we, we wipe off the tube and sterilize it before somebody new hits it or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:42:53       But um, to me it's more so that it's like right off the bat, some people might feel obligated to do it when they really don't want to. And then that starts the interview on a weird foot. Well, but we're, I mean as I guess we're about to see the person I thought would be like, hell no. And uh, he was super down. That's the problem, right? Is that you on one hand, say this was a little strange and they're going to be uncomfortable, but I know on the other hand you have moments like this. Okay. So I'm happy to comply. Rip It. Okay. Sorry, I just breathe out, but then I got the button that rips nice. He's fucking legendary. Damn. You know the cops are battery powered. He's Canadian. Let's listen. Let's be honest. I mean they know. They know how to do this up there. I'm impressive. I remember he said a rituals are important. That's fine. Was He the first one? We may do that. No, we had hardly and Bobby Lee and everybody did it. We had a lot of people doing it. I feel like he was the first time I was. He was thinking that too because it. Yeah, it doesn't. It tastes like battery acid or some days. Gotcha. Sleeping that it goes through a definitely. It makes it taste a little funky, but it's all good. He was unfazed back then. It were older, there was still

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       a clean hit, but as time has gone on, it hits so harsh that you feel like battery is the thing. It was, it was made as a prop and so you know, it's not necessarily over the longterm. So. So what you're saying, Dan, is that we need to build a more, a more resilient little regarding not a prop center, if you, if you own a vape company out there, hit us up podcasts@hvhcproductions.com. Well that was a special moment regardless of if it was right or wrong. Justin Pranks, Joel Osteen, another great moment from last year's charity event, we called it Joel Osteen is this mega preacher who was in the media at the time because he closed, they had this horrible hurricane, hurricane and tons of people were homeless and without shelter. And Joel, a man of God had this mega church and the worst area on the high ground, completely unaffected by the flooding and the church was closed. He wasn't letting anybody in there. So he was getting slammed all throughout the media and we took it upon ourselves to vigilante justice. And Justin calls in Joel Osteen and the woman who answers is just, I mean, lack of a better term, a little bit of a loony tune. I think that's more than fair. Yeah. So here we go.

Speaker 5:          00:45:55       Keep saying ricky, do you. Do you know someone named, started talking to Ricky? Todd. Todd, todd, todd. Todd. What is. What does any of this mean? I'm confused. If I were to translate this, would it be. Would it be like, Hey, don't let people into the building during the flood because we don't want the steps. I heard you the first time I heard it the first time. What did Jesus? Twenty 15, 2015 was a good year. Flight News. Flight News battles. Is that a magazine or what are you talking about? I am so confused right now because it's supposed to be some kind of. Yes. Oh, it's apparel line per line where you just ramble. Crazy. Nonsense. What language is this? I just, I'm going to call my translator so I can follow the conversation. Keep pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, Tuck, Tuck, tuck. Ricky, taxi. Puppy. Topic topic. Ricky ticky. Tacky Paki. Pocket talky. Talky. Laughing at it because you know it's funny because it's ridiculous. That's why you're laughing right now. I just

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       made the demon. Satan. This is a thing apparently. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's part of the ritual to a purge the evil out of her phone calls. Dude, that was so crazy. That was so much more insane than I ever could have expected. You have to. Yes. He seems kind of. I may get some out of that. Do we still have that number? You want to call it a couple of Ricky ticky tack? Yeah. We'll take shit too far. This is what this is Christianity on. This is what happens when you overdose on Christianity at the blood of Jesus. Oh my God. Everything in moderation with folks to keep talking to you. Fuck you. Fuck you're dying of Shit. She's going to put me up to the next level was prayer line. She's like, I'm putting. I'm putting time speaking in tongues. I cannot believe that was a special moment. Yeah. Wow. I mean, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:48:41       find someone that's just start speaking in tongues and laughing. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:48:45       Damon is a beautiful moment. I remembered that made national news, but like there were like article about viral moment, right? Yeah. Also, the previous one made it into articles with post malone because he was saying he was talking about when the dream was going to end December first he joked, he joked and then people thought. We said that was the day beer bongs and belly and the drama and everything. Refer. Billboard was like thought that was the data release, just goofing around and then act on December first. I felt bad because he had to tweet out Saturday. Everybody album's not coming out today. It was so obviously joking. What the hell people. Oh yeah, that was great. I mean huge like rolling stone billboard poster, loan reveals and when I saw those articles I was like, wait, where did he say that? And then to find that it was our strategy. Talking about poetry. It's funny because they don't mention this yet.

Speaker 1:          00:49:42       No, they're just like post Malone said bastards. They had mentioned the show. People would have been like, oh, it's not serious. Right. Jack. Now, this was a moment that I personally loved is that the night before the Jack Black episode aired, Justin reuland reached out to me and he said, do you know that I used to, I met Jack Black Lung, the goal, and he helped me pitch and sell my first show ever. And he's a huge inspiration to me and was a huge help to me. And he sent me all this incredible media, like pictures that said, what did it say? Keep, um, doors down, knocked the doors down, um, and he had even done a cameo in his first show that he sold. And Jack talking about how

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       like, um, Bob Odenkirk, Bob Odenkirk and David Cross had given them their big break by putting them on Mr Show. And so that Kinda gave me the perfect end to be like, well, somebody at you, you've apparently, uh, you know, passed it on. This was a beautiful moment. I understand that from a mutual friend of ours. You are also an advocate. I have, I have a surprise, somewhat of a surprise in what God is. Am I going to be surprised by someone from blast from my past going to enter the room? I think so, no. I'm really excited. A friend of mine, I launched out. God because he heard you were going to be a show and I don't know that you've seen this. He said, but I think that you want to say for the record, I think that's one of my favorite episodes we've ever done. Yeah, I know it's recent, but honestly like to have the best guests we've ever had.

Speaker 4:          00:51:14       Just so cool. So funny. They hung out before and after they sang for us after that. It was incredible. We probably never. Was that like, can we have a wii? So Zach, who's our sound lad, he's a musician. He shreds on guitar. Well thank you very much. And He um, kyle gas is like a crazy shredder. And so Zach and Kyle and Jack started jamming and sinking. Yeah. Zach knew a master exploder, which was a tenacious d song and uh, I think it was asking Kyle about his guitar. It was like, here, take a look or whatever. And he just started busting out into the song and like I had like a split second moment of like, oh, like, you know, don't try and show them up or whatever. I was completely wrong. They immediately just launched into the song and they like play the entire song with him, sing the whole thing. It was so cool. How was that for you, Zach? Who was one of the highlights of my life.

Speaker 4:          00:52:10       I do have a video of it on my phone, but I said, oh Sheila, to get that up. Maybe we can tweet it later. Something to eat it later from the podcast flutter. That'd be great. It was insane. It was just like he started singing and that was just like, oh my God, I can't believe this is happening right now. I could tell on Zach's been living out a fantasy for us. Yeah, they really, I mean those guys. And Jack Black is such a legend. Like man, I used to be obsessed with his HBO series is one of the funniest things ever. And originally it really when we were researching for them coming in. Um, as part of that, I went back and watched some of it had been years. I haven't seen it in forever. Completely holds up so funny. So it doesn't hold up. Hold up. I find this joke a fairly tasteless. You remember the but babies in the desert where Kyle gives handled birth. Oh my God, I love that. So good. But at any rate where we be joined by it. Wow. You will be joined by. You will be joined by. It's never been Lloyd. So hang on. Here we go. Tell me if you recognize this. Oh my God. It's just an reuland. Yeah. Oh my God. So speaking

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       of Virginia, so Justin Reuland, Jack Black helped Justin reuland pitch and sell his first show as eap. Wow. Jack helped him get his foot in the door. No, by the way, Jack is amazing. He helped me and he believed in me and I just want to say hi and thank you. And that he loves. What a mench. Well, let me see because you did. It can be able to convey that sincerity to Jack Black come up as good as it gets. Definitely. And the fact that Justin had the picture still as good as it gathers polaroids. I guess they are. Let me, let me find that for thing. But he doesn't throw away and I know. I know in Jack. Actually, I never conveyed what Justin said because I showed them that clip and he cracked up laughing when Jack was like, oh, Justin's a saver. Because Justin is a hoarder.

Speaker 2:          00:54:22       When you go in his house, you're going to tell this guy doesn't throw anything out there it is. There it is. Modest. But he. This is what he told me. Okay, look, I couldn't believe he sent me this photo last night. Blow doors down. He's a saver, but I can't believe how young men. He's a different person. He's a sweet kid. Dude. Look at him. I was wild. I know. Look at that little genius. Just a true genius. Oh God. He's like, he's like one of these crazy geniuses that are fearless and like on hesitant, you know, like he doesn't have a filter in the best way possible. And he's just, he embraces these, like his game coming out. It's so imaginative and it's just, it's like, so uniquely him, you know, it's almost no one else could have made it, but him, he really is such a creative force and a truly an honor to consider him a friend and this was just really one of my favorite moments probably. So there you have it.

Speaker 2:          00:55:37       Next, what do we got? Oh, here's a great one. I'm almost done with my list. By the way. Martin scarelli admits to doing crimes alive. I couldn't believe I forgot this. This is legendary. This was another one of those unplanned, beautiful genius moments where we're having a live show with, I think it was eric and Jesse wellons and somebody, and this was right after scarelli got like a sentence that are convicted. He was convicted. It was before the sentencing, which is is key to why this was so amazing because it was very much underplaying how much punishment was coming as well. He didn't know and he, he seemed pretty confident when he was saying he seemed to have the feeling that he was getting off with a slap on the wrist and he, he asks us, well, how much? He's like, I'm not admitting anything but how, how much jail time would you do for $100,000,000?

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       And we're like, what do you mean by that? How did it happen? We were just talking about him and then he and he was streaming and then I started watching our stream on history back. I just keeping an eye on the chat and people were just started spamming in the chat. Hey, uh, Martin Shkreli is like streaming right now. And he's watching you guys was like, what the fuck? Sure enough. So we're like, well we've got, we've got to get squirelly on here if we can. And after you know, trying to align it up, we finally figured out and got them on and and well here, let me play the clip for you because this truly. He's in prison right now and I've always suspected that this clip of him on our show was played before the judge, once before sensitive thinking. He goes, listen to this, listen to this crazy question. If you could make $100,000,000, but you had to go to jail, how much time would you do? Is this related to your situation? Totally. Totally unrelated because you just spent $30,000 and I flick your answer was sarcastic. It seems to be a little bit of.

Speaker 2:          00:57:50       I mean for how much water mill? Hundred million. If I fucking Tony Sorento for $100, million dollars, how much time would you do? He asked just money. How much time would I do? And My, my, you're the orange. Is the new black. Is it on the expense of people who suffers straight up like, hey, serve a year. Here's a bunch of money. Nobody suffers. What would you. What would you. What would you do? Zero to zero to 30. Oh, zero to 30 days. Criminal especially sense. So even if you assume I'm guilty of not coming out of this with over 100 million dollars and he locked the judge took all pretty much all of his money. Right? Including honestly when, why even go on at that point. But he's a cocky bitch. He couldn't help but brag. Right? And if he couldn't come help, uh, come on and be like, if you could make $100,000,000, how much time would you do it?

Speaker 2:          00:59:00       Kept it kept going on, on this trans about how people just don't understand that he's not scamming anyone is just messing with the insurance companies to help fund more research. And this dream. I've, I've learned a lot more about the topic and it was totally. That's the talking point of all these pharmaceutical companies who jacked the price up like a times. They always say the same thing that he was saying and I guess he convinced some people that that's true, but what they say is, oh, well, by raising the price of 100 times, we make it more accessible, which is like a total, like double speak, counterintuitive, but they say it gives us more money for research and it helps us subsidize people who can't afford it except that there's actually no evidence of any of these guys giving it out for free. Like they supposedly say they do. Well. And also the people that pay for it as health insurance and government and social security so ends up costing taxpayers like a billion dollars.

Speaker 4:          00:59:53       Yeah. Or more, probably a lot more. But uh, at any rate, um, and he also wasn't in that clip, but I remember in that interview, um, he was like, I'll get six months. That was his destiny and it's seven years, more than six months. And then they took money and they took the Wu Tang album. I mean, there. Yeah, there you have it.

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       His story is one that's just so fascinating that he became so notorious. Like he, he said it in this interview and he's right, there's way bigger offenders than he is that are way more powerful and way more wealthy and way more. I would say, well, I don't know about way more, but they are predatory on a larger scale. They will avoid scrutiny. But somehow he was made notorious by the media, I guess because he's put himself out there probably.

Speaker 4:          01:00:38       Yes. Sacrifice the anonymity that the other guys like cherish in exchange for being like a meme, a meme, Lord in the public eye. So you want it to be a cool, edgy. He paid the ultimate price. It is an interesting thing though, because I mean, his big mistake in a way was just being honest about what he was doing. Like he just, he was kind of weird. How is that? I mean, uh, you know, trying to make that argument that it wasn't fraud. I mean, obviously the court did not agree with that. Um, but, but just raising the money and everything, you know, he, he, what he said oftentimes was just, you know, all these companies do this. Um, I agree. I agree. No, that wasn't on their investigations. Now, maybe not all, but a lot of them are. Well, he lost in the court of public opinion and that's why everyone went after him, but we have to be Hillary Clinton's DNA to.

Speaker 4:          01:01:33       Oh, that's great. That's the reason he ended up going to prison is because he was on probation and then he made a tweet sarcastically asking anyone to get a sample of Hillary Clinton's DNA so we could clone her. Said I have the sequences, and so the judge determined that he was hilarious, but it wasn't worth it. They joke like probation. He was out on bail and bond and they removed his bail is a judge that he was a threat to public safety, but actually he did. He ended up going to prison for. It had nothing to do with the medicine. It was. He defrauded investors, have a, have a, a hedge fund. Amazing stuff. Well, yeah. It's like

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       you're involved in so many shady things. You went to prison for the one that always the good guy. He's the good guy to him. Always remember Squirelly for rip her Rhombi. Yeah. Let's pull that up because that is generally up. I'd watch a scary movie that's probably coming late. What does that mean? Wait, you would watch? Oh yeah. I would watch. Let's. Let's do it. This is literally straight later. He's a fascinating guy and I'll tell you what, every time you he's streaming or something, he's always sitting alone home by himself, like he's like the loneliest dude ever. It's pretty sad, but here he is trolling CBS. Now

Speaker 8:          01:02:58       further away you talk about being upset. Harambie who is the gorilla that was killed at the Cincinnati Zoo on twitter? Talk about caring so much about them that the life meant so much. The Cincinnati Zoo was come out and asked people to stop using means and you've. You've used it, a lot of memes and social media. How is this going to stop in order to honor him? So it was sort of moonlighting. Scientists, you know, I, I work a lot with nonhuman primates. We call them in the labs NHP. So any rhesus monkeys capuchins all the way up to the higher orders. While my brother and I especially have this deep fondness for, for animals that are so close to humans, so remarkably close, in fact, there are Benobos that can even communicate with you on a one to one level and tell jokes and be sarcastic and funny and even flirt with you.

Speaker 8:          01:03:53       It's unbelievable how humanlike these creatures are. An idea that we just shot this whole one day is the argument that is, to be honest, it's painful to even talk about this, but back to the issue which is that in in this country, I don't think we value nonhuman primate life the way we should. I think these animals actually should have rights. We it or not, if they did Martin, they wouldn't be able to be used in the pharmaceutical industry, which don't think, I don't think they should be. You know, I do a lot of and I've, I've, I've overseen the death of thousands of these animals. Rats and many times the overseeing. Absolutely. Every single pharmaceutical executive house, a Pfizer probably kills a million animals here. It's completely true. That's fair to them. You know, if that doesn't, I can't tell. I can't either,

Speaker 2:          01:04:50       no, because actually I do agree with what he's saying, but that, but it's such a troll. It's hard to get a read on

Speaker 8:          01:04:57       when you talk about that. It feels like it is very, it was a moral decision. It's, it's how you feel morally and yet when you talk about drug prices, when we were talking earlier, and, and I know you're saying it should go to the insurance company, is it's, it's up to the insurance companies. But why not have that same moral compassion for the way the system is more moral, compassionate? You know, I mean, uh, I think that, uh, there's a lot of them, for instance, 7,000 rare diseases. There's only five or six companies in the world that care about those diseases. The pfizers, the mercks, the ASTRAZENECAS. I care about the big sellers, but there's dying kids, friends of mine, like the closer brother's three kids with Pekin. I invented the first drug ever for Pekin and these three kids, they are staring at their death sentence. They're teenagers. And uh, I'm fighting my butt off to, to save them and need money to do that. Investors don't care for these little diseases and so forth, so I think that a lot more compassion than most people think. That's why I'm in the drug business, but at the same time a nonhuman,

Speaker 1:          01:05:51       I find it also happens to be the most lucrative, but at any rate, rest in peace around. We went down the hall a little bit too far and finally my favorite top moment is dis. Doctor disrespect, jumping through the roof and here we have. All right. Let's see. Yeah, let's see here. You have knocked as well. Wait a minute. Knocked his hair back. Hold on a second. Look at me. I forgot I got all dressed up like that. I need to do something in that character. Character is great. Professor Prophecy. We may have another clip of prophecy. Oh, we have one coming up. This was a pretty special episodes. I'm God, we got to do something. I like that get a lot, but you know, worth mentioning is that a lot of people criticized us. By the way, I don't have any problem showing. He's clearly shown himself out of costume now as many of you have seen, but a lot of people were angry because in fact they weren't even saying, well, this is the highlight.

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       Yeah. Um, they were even saying that we purposely such wishes. I always resented that because first of all, what chocolate, what happened? Oh, at the end of the episode we always go to like a slate and go to the wide. And so as soon as immediately as the is done, he takes off his wig and classes and you see him at a character. But we do that at the end of every episode. And I, I, I had no way to know that he was going to take everything off immediately. Our attention. I just did that, right? Yeah. It's not actually in the episode because we cut it out. It was only in the twitch. On twitch. Yeah. Actually somebody submitted a stock sing a hymn, doxing him as their worst moment in the email. So I actually do have that clip because somebody re uploaded it, which made sense. Then he is showing himself a bunch of times even before, by the way, even before that I did, but hey, what can you say? There's a piece. There's always someone to complain, but not intentional. No, of course not. People always assume the worst. I've found they did it on purpose. Yeah, it was a huge plant. That's the only reason I went. Okay, we're over and I'll take off your wig. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       So there you have it. Now I've got two worst moments to share with you guys just selected by you. These are selected by me. Okay. Now, first of all, worst moment we go way, way back to our first live episode. I'm sure you guys have all seen this Joji Mehmed on me. So bad way. This was framed up just that we were doing. We were. We were like hours in. I was so drunk at this time. We were just chit chatting. I think we were talking about how like in the animal kingdom, let's look at shredder. He's, he's a serial rapist. Okay. Our dog and Fred or goes to the dog park. No, seriously. He goes out there and he'll fuck anything that moves. He doesn't ask for consent. It will try. And my only point is that back in the day, human beings like neanderthals or whatever, earlier form, even apes, they're out there.

Speaker 2:          01:09:10       They're, I don't know that they're, they fuck they, you know what I'm saying? Just I'll say. Okay. Does that make sense? It was just like, not, not thinking research, just some stupid like conversation. Right. Which is always what people get upset about, which is a couple of people shooting the shit. All right. Just a fucking idiot. I didn't pretend to be anything more than just a fucking idiot and in this case a drunk idiot. But that being said, I don't think anyone was actually offended by this, but it was just funny how it played out. So here I am talking about that or apps or whatever. Right. Our Art Watch, neanderthal eulogies were probably just breaking like crazy. So there's definitely a neanderthal in us to like conquer men want to like grow up. So it's, you know, women are in a nature setting, like to be conquered.

Speaker 2:          01:10:00       It came out and it was super weird and Super Long Island. Actually the most brilliant part about it. Yeah. The most brilliant part about this is that I'm sure he didn't know his face was in. It's just pure, genuine, pure, genuine reaction. It's pure silence, man. You got me good. Look at that shot. Oh stole. I still see this posted all the time. I don't think I'll ever live that. You got my good. And then there's. I have an honorable mention. This is a new. This is a new moment and I can't tell if it's the best or worst. So here we are entering a new moment into the lexicon. I saw this on the subreddit. Someone who follows my dad on twitter. Now you know when somebody likes something on twitter, blows up on their feed. So someone decided to follow my dad on twitter and he posted this on the subreddit and dad, I love you, but you got to know something.

Speaker 2:          01:11:12       Things just you can't do. You're a public figure. Now Dad. Gary liked a. you've got a few hours left on abby snaps to see how sexy yesterday was. It's a girl eating out another girl, dad. You don't have to like, like, like you don't have to like porn elite if you're going to look at it, you don't have to slam a like on a cruise. Yeah, he, my dad got Ted Cruz told him that you discovered this or I showed it to him. I said, I said, dad, just so you know, is he watching the stream right now? Probably Dad. Just so you have to like it. It shows up on other people's feet. Had to play it off. Cool. He was like, he said something like, freedom with a bunch of exclamation marks, a legend and a dad find. Look at porn. You don't have to like it, but I can just imagine this poor guy who followed him, who decided to follow my gut. Just scrolling this twitter feed. Now Gary likes. It's such an old people facebook thing. It's so brutal. I can't decide if that's the worst, but there you have a gear. So I will now pass it off to you. Uh, you want to switch seats with me or no

Speaker 9:          01:12:32       man, it's. So. It's just two links. So set aside, oh well, it's kind of a rough change from the last one. Um, I guess one of my favorite moments, I don't know if it's like favorite, it's weird to describe it, but having a total biscuit on the show and um, later that year he passed away. So that was just a surreal, I guess, experienced have here and they talked about cancer and yet having him on here, I'm so thankful that we had the opportunity to have him on the uh, so on the show when we did. Seriously. So here's the little excerpt that, uh, from, from him talking about living with stage four cancer, let's make sure at that time counts for something. A lot of it is also, you assume at this age you've got, wow, I've got 50, 60 years with the family. What if you didn't?

Speaker 9:          01:13:31       While we know you don't know how long you've got, so you know, make me want to try and be a better dad was not out about that. I wanted to connect more with my stepson and then I have and I've been doing that. I want to connect more with my wife, make sure that we get a good to, you know, we get go to run out of it. I intended to be around when I'm fucking 100 years old will be still bitching about video games if I can be, but sometimes that might be something outside of my control it, you know, maybe fighting isn't enough. Maybe that's just not enough to keep going, but if that's the case then you've got to make sure that you spend the time you've got in the best way you can. And even then it's not like it changes you overnight. Like you still want to go read reddit comments. You still want to go that shit. People on twitter, like you can't change the habit of a lifetime, but there's something in the back of your mind that they have something bad to do. You know, maybe that, that does change over time. I think.

Speaker 1:          01:14:27       Well and some burly, he did pass away I think like five or six months or maybe even less. It really shocked me. I just, I mean he seemed. I mean, I know he was in pain and he was on chemo and you see, he was very, he was very optimistic guy. He was a fighter. Yeah. That's the thing about this disease, you, it doesn't show like you don't use the person looks the same. Right. So you just don't see the decline in their status. And it was the same with my dad up until the last moment. He looked healthy, like it looked fine. I didn't even lose his hair and nothing will look the same. Yeah. So it's shocking when it happens, but I, uh, thought it would be cool to remember him did. Absolutely. Yeah. I had watched him all growing up. I mean, like he was the starcraft guy and I was, I played a ton of starcraft growing up, uh, and so that was surreal to even have him in there at all. And then to hear him talking about his disease like that and so openly and with so much optimism. It was, that was, that was a special one. That was cool. Yeah. I cherish that. I look at the picture of us on the wall like somewhat regularly. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:43       And so last year, what I remember from that interview was he kept saying like, you know, five of my days are bad and two of them are good and that's enough for me to comment.

Speaker 10:         01:15:57       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:15:58       yeah. He left a hole in the gaming community too. That hasn't really been filled. I feel like it's such a unique voice. Yeah, that is definitely true. Um, well God bless him. [inaudible] Hammond, Carl Jackson, which was data. Oh my God, that's so fucking heartbreaking. All happened at the same year. I don't think we've ever talked about Carl did. We have, we may have mentioned it. He was a fan who, uh, had a rare type of cancer that ate fat cells in your body. Super Rare. So there's very little research about how to cure it. Right. And he actually was a, was a, I would say, a little chunky, like originally before he had cancer, kind of a larger guy. And by the time I met him, he, I mean he looked like, um,

Speaker 1:          01:17:04       like anorexic. Wow. And so he had awful rare form of cancer that was just eating all this, a fat cells away until he just perished from, just wasted away. But he wrote us an email and we reached out and we sent them gifts. He was a huge fan of teddy fresh and like he was a big fan of ours and I had played pub g with him a couple of times and we kept in regular contact and he was such a sweet fucking dude. He was such a sweet dude. Is such a great outlook, you know. And I hadn't talked to him for. Oh yeah. And he went to like, his only dream was to go to Disneyland and he had this big a make a wish foundation seminar to Disney. And we sent them like 500 bucks or something for spending money because this fan, he would have like a single mom.

Speaker 1:          01:17:53       There were, it was like the saddest shit ever. His Dad wasn't in the picture. So just two weeks go by and I haven't uh, talked to him. And then someone, another youtuber who was in touch with him just sent me like a dam or something like, Hey, I just want to let you know in case you didn't hear that Carl passed away. I was like, damn, it's so tragic. He was like 18 years old. God, are you looking for a picture? I'm trying to send it here. If you go through the email [inaudible] ethan is twitter. Oh, there you go. Oh yeah, this is, this is. Yeah. He was active on twitter and he was really loving because people started following them on twitter and he was getting some really positive support and attention. I mean, you can see how [inaudible] health then he had become. And um, one day he just stops or a fat cells

Speaker 4:          01:18:59       that I've never heard of that. I mean, I guess you said it's super rare. Super Rare. That's crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:19:03       Uh Huh. And one day he just, his twitter stopped. And when was that? That was, that I see is mom tweeted something. I didn't see that. I think this was the last thing I've ever seen was him being like, I totally didn't preorder this because they have been super hand play. Yeah. He was a sweet kid, man. He was a fucking real sweet dude. Not a part of the podcast, but something that definitely we experienced. Sure. But either you do have. Oh, you just have the worst snow.

Speaker 4:          01:19:45       So what's your worst? How do you thought that very optimistic person today though? Maybe I. Okay. So the worst one was actually when I went to Israel. All right. This actually works out because your worst is actually pretty fun. Um, I went to Israel twice when my dad

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       wasn't feeling well, but the first time a stayed and Kinda fucked it up on the podcast. So getting drunk and talking shit guys that it shouldn't have. And um, so then I rescheduled that. I will call in from Israel. So that's the moment.

Speaker 11:         01:20:33       Hello.

Speaker 1:          01:20:38       Well it's up to you. Didn't, you don't know anything about this, right? You didn't, you're not updated on all this. Then I left for one day for one day. Everything is ruined. Lives is not my fault. It's your fault. You know what's going to happen. You think that I can handle myself without a carer. You leave me in here. I can't. I can't deal with this. You leave me in a room with Eric and jacket. Two bottles of Hennessy idea. Was that how many pizza slices did you have? A lot, dude. That's all I was upset about it. You just lose that weight even though I'm sorry for smoking by the way. I'm not smoking anymore. I'm done. That's the last cigarette. You'll see me smoke on this podcast or on the street.

Speaker 2:          01:21:38       Not entirely true, but I think I've had like three cigarettes since then. Okay. Yeah, that's very good. So

Speaker 1:          01:21:49       anyway, did you. Were you listening

Speaker 2:          01:21:51       there? Yeah, it was great. That was actually a great way to break the. Well, there you have it. Isla is best and worst. I'm very nice. Now up next we've got Dan and Ian here with the. Let me see here. We've got the. Whereas this estrone worse. Dan, why don't we change spots? That'll be. That'll be better than has a few. Let me go down to your spot. So we all have best sim worse now, Dan, here you go.

Speaker 11:         01:22:24       There might've been some overlap but I don't think so. I don't think there is. Alright. So um, alright. So yeah, this is great. This, uh, this first one, this was really shortly after coming to work with you guys. I want to say it was maybe the second episode that I ever did, um, which was such a treat because it was the episode we did with the CFO, which, you know, I'd like legend. I had grown up watching jackass. I love that shit. And um, and you know, a week into this Gig, you know, getting into, hanging out with Steve all day. It was like this is pretty cool. And so back then we did the ad reads live and I can't believe we ever did that crazy. Uh, so they did the ads live and then, you know, you guys wanted to take a break to use the restroom and he was like, oh, I'm good.

Speaker 11:         01:23:19       And it's like, well, you know, you can hang out and I think we had like an ipad or something with the twitch chat going. And so, uh, he saw somebody in the twitch chat say, Hey, what's, uh, what's your craziest drug story? And immediately he launches into fucking wild story about a time at like, cause you know, he's clean now. He doesn't do any of this, but he was just, you know, this was maybe 10 years prior. I don't think I ever watched this back. Oh, well this is my first time. I actually have it timestamped to the moment. You guys walked back in. Here we go here. The whole story. Yeah. That's fucking watch. I've never watched it. It's our own content for Christ sake.

Speaker 6:          01:23:57       Yes. Since you're my best drug story. Oh my God, I can't. I tell, I'll tell you, my God fucked up.

Speaker 11:         01:24:05       He's alone in the room. You know, I thought about asking him that question, but I was like, should we get set all the time? You know, but

Speaker 6:          01:24:11       I was reading that it just wasn't fucking funny. I'm going to shut this door now. What a professional. Yeah, I know was so helplessly addicted to cocaine. It was insane. Like if I ran out, I would call this drug dealer. And uh, I was waiting for a call from him. I'd be like, dude, using my cell phone as a pillow so that when it vibrated, Meghan would wake up, be like, oh yeah, and new drugs. Now if I went to a event, I caught up the drug dealer and he didn't answer, I would just fucking show up at his place. I would just go there. And you're like, ah. When I got to his place, our, our Ed try the door. Sometimes it was open and I would just walk in and sometimes it wasn't open and that was upsetting. Um, this guy, okay. This drug dealer wasn't just a drug dealer.

Speaker 6:          01:25:05       He was also like a hardcore addict. And when I can, and I'm talking about cocaine, this guy would inject cocaine. He would shoot up and for some reason never injected anything. Yeah. Some reason that I just don't understand about people who shoot up cocaine is that with their syringe, they scored their own blood all over the planet. I mean, this guy's apartment and it was all like, I don't think that's normal sativa sealing the furniture this motherfucker had to. His with syringes, what squirt all over the place. Blood I showed up and I would walk in. I'd find the guy like sitting there with like literally needles fucking hang out. I felt like it was hanging out of his neck one time. You're sitting there and I walked in. He was like, oh, hey, what's up dude?

Speaker 6:          01:25:57       What's up bro? Like a fuck. It was gnarly. And um, you know, I didn't. Whatever. I wouldn't judge him. I'd be like, Oh yeah, hey man, I only got to give me some coke. I would buy like a bunch, you know, like I'm kind of so I can always buy like quite a lot and I'm fucking time. I showed up at his door was not, it wasn't, it wasn't locked and it was open. I walked in, it wasn't in the living room. He was in his back bedroom. It was like a guest house kind of a deal and it wasn't like an apartment, but it was, it was like a guest house. He went through the back of someone's driveway and then he was, he was in the back and I walked in. So he's in his bedroom, in the back and like, the dude's like, he wasn't dead obviously, like, but he was not responsive, you know, he was so he had been awake for so many days that there's no fuck awakened this guy up.

Speaker 6:          01:26:49       And he's like, I'm like trying to wake him up yet and I need fucking drugs, you know, like he's using, there's no getting this guy up. So, so thought man, like I just finally was like, okay, fuck, you know, he's just sleeping so I'm just not going to get them up. So I went myself into his living room to the table where he would weigh out all of his drugs and there was from him weighing. So this guys sold so much fucking drugs that, that on the table itself, there was just like a fucking residue of coke has built up. And I'm looking at it like I knew that if I took a car that uh, that I could just, I could scrape up like the gnarliest pile of cocaine. And I'm just like, I'm just going to go. I want drugs. I'm just, fuck, I'm going to go fucking hell my sub to go scrape.

Speaker 6:          01:27:38       So now I go and I sit down at the table where and I'm looking at it, there's cookie cookie and all over it. But like I said, the motherfucker squirted his own blood everywhere so it's like cooking with blood, like little bladders, like thin, like you know, and I'm like fuck is a terrible idea. There's just this is fucking bad. And I'm like. And I just start scraping on fucking cooking and like I can like visibly, like in the pilot I'm scraping like it. I can see specks of blood on this. This is how fucking bad. I was addicted. Sad there. Like a fucking snorted them motherfuckers blood to ask me for my craziest drug story.

Speaker 4:          01:28:26       That was on my. I wanted to ask you, the bad is dry. I just dropped the CBO is an incredible storyteller. Sober. No, it looks really healthy. Really healthy and it looks like he was reacting to people in the room, like making eye contact with me. You had talked about how he used to see cigarette. Yeah, but while I was kept, that was, that was like four minutes.

Speaker 11:         01:29:02       I never knew I had my mind. I was always like, snore, blood Wimax, when that whole thing as like, what's the setup, would there you have it? Well, I'm glad I didn't realize you guys hadn't seen it at all. So I'm glad we, uh, we got to review that. Yeah. And like you guys, like I said, you had gone out to the bathroom, so I'm just sitting in that other room and my jaw was dropped. This is telling the story. I'm like, is he fucking for real right now? So, uh, so that was pretty wonderful. Launched. I watched the documentary but steevo during those early years. And he was, he was wild. He was not, not well, that was all serious. Yeah. Oh yeah. I don't doubt that at all. Yeah. So, um, so that was definitely a, a great early memory of working with. Yeah, that was episode 12, the podcast, and I think I had come in on 11 so that, you know, that was my second episode. Went from Joey Salads to having stable on the one end to the other right there. So then actually my next uh, was, was also the Martin Shkreli thing. Um, so we've already, we've already gone down that rabbit hole a little bit. Uh, what else do we got here? Um, all right. This is, don't, don't judge me is a little corny, but this is not one of my favorites.

Speaker 5:          01:30:20       Yeah. So the podcast, I've got a little announcement, not really an announcement, just something I wanted to talk about and just to give some context. You guys didn't tell us either like something was up, but this, I, I found out the same time as all of you. So, uh, so this was a pretty special moment, but it may be that. And also the delivery is hilarious. There's a new thing of the thickening was going to be thickening up here soon. What does that mean? What I'm trying to say is that Isla won't be drinking alcohol. So if she's responsible what I'm trying to say. Podcast extra. Oh, how long was that going? Oh, it just started, like you turned it off immediately. Flashed red, they're like, no, he lives. There's two stripes. She's cooking something up. It's a cinnamon roll with Ross Standard. Isla. It's weird. She's 11. I think we literally found out the day we couldn't keep it. Well it's, we, we don't know yet if anything's gonna go wrong. She's pregnant. So I just say, you know, because

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       that's very sweet of you Dan. That genuinely was. That was the specialists are warming. Yeah. Well she is. The thickening has happened. Can you show like over just do like a tight, like make your shirt tight. Oh, look at the camera. Let me see what we can see it on the wall. It's hard to tell, but when there was a bomb, it's funny because you're like halfway through and you. I mean these next four months are going to go fast. Exhilarates celebrate from here on out. Yeah. No, but I was sought isla the other day when she was getting dressed or like just yesterday and as she's putting a shirt on, I'm like, Holy Shit, there's a baby in there. Yeah, no, it's weird. Yeah, that's great. And then, uh, this I'll make, I had a few more, but I'll make this my last of my favorite. Um, this is to this day, my favorite line that's ever been uttered on this podcast. I don't think it'll ever be topped, honestly. I'm curious. What is it?

Speaker 4:          01:33:05       So 39 with post Malone looks so exhausting. It is. I looked like shit. Now you look in the. You're killing it, bro. I love that. You just. The great thing is that you just embrace your authentic dude. You're who you are. Like you just fucking. You're killing it, bro. I'm just a guy. Exactly. Just to kind of beautiful blue eyes. Right? I guess that means you are more than just a gun because I didn't have that. I'm really just the guy. Your eyes look like hamburgers. Yeah. That is amazing. That's so fucking funny. But I think of that regular. That's a very original line. And they do export village. Your eyes are like blueberry and want to eat them.

Speaker 4:          01:33:55       That Tom Petty Song write a brown eyed girl than Morrison. Van Morrison. Marsha, that was quick. I'm right on that. But famously a post malone as a new track coming out on his new album called hamburger. I'd about me. That's awesome. Congrats. Um, okay. And then, uh, and then I just have one worst moment that I need to put up there. I'm legitimately still have nightmares about this. Occasionally. That's not a joke. I'll have like stress nightmares about work and we are streaming. God, this was our first on youtube on youtube. Come over and see what it feels like because we've never actually watched from the show. And so I thought it'd be a fun experience to see that one point. 2 million views on today's episode. I can't believe people watch this.

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       It keeps me going for like over a minute. Isla, you are looking good and Dan is screaming at the end. I can't hear him on twitch. You can do appreciate working here. And then I know I'm in this little minor escape that I never want to know. What happened, which made this so great,

Speaker 4:          01:35:32       is that it was our first live episode on Youtube, which means that because we were live streaming on twitch, so if we had a mistake like this, we could just start over. Right. And then cut it up. So this was the first time that it was like when you got to actually nail this live and I think part of it too is that, you know, I usually double check all the computers and would check for this kind of stuff, but because it was the first time on Youtube I had a million new, like it wasn't routine, like it was the first day of the new setup and so my mind was a million places and didn't see that you had stream open. Whoops. Hey look, we got one point, 2 million views. Yeah, I guess it's worked out. Somehow people powered through that makes me feel better. At one point 2 million people have seen me feel better. I give to hard on yourself then. Yeah. Well you know, you. Especially if you have an anxiety attack on camera. Yeah, exactly. It wasn't a disaster. It sounds like an anxiety attack. Then after that episode we go and we see how bad is it? Like, oh, we're like, oh, how bad could it be?

Speaker 4:          01:36:40       And it keeps going and it keeps going. You guys, when I told you I was, you were like, you know, after the episode it was like, hello, how bad is it? And it was like pretty bad. Well, it's fun. It's funny in retrospect as to I guess, but um, but yeah, I mean I'll, I'll sometimes have like just this past week. Yeah, it was the night before the charity stream. Not, I didn't dream about that, but I had a dream that our audio board, all the settings got erased like five minutes at a horse show, which anybody that's done audio would know that that's like, you know, two hours of reset that would need to happen. And so I'm glad to know you're having nightmares about what it means. You really care. I do the next day or whatever. Naked. So cherished memories, cherished memories and not so cherished memories. So yeah, so that was, that was my lineup and we got.

Speaker 5:          01:37:39       We got him in here. Why don't you guys switch seats? I left my soda and the other room.

Speaker 4:          01:37:46       Oh sure. This is not so many Saudis. Saudi paps could. Oh, I see where it is. Yeah, you should just be the list. Right.

Speaker 12:         01:38:01       Gotcha.

Speaker 4:          01:38:08       Dead Air. So this one was Dan. Let's listen to it. Early on when I started working here. And this moment I think took us all caught us all by surprise. Bradbury showed up. Wait, hold on. What is this clip? But only it's 2000 views. This is way early on the channel. The highlight channels. One of the first no videos, that highlight channel is going to be the lowest by the way. Highlight channel. Just hit a million subscribers. That is so cool because we all created that highlight channel together less than a year ago because people were stealing our clips and posting it, sort of like what the hell we should do it. Right. And uh, the explosion there has been phenomenal and it's so cool that we've all built that together. You guys were all here from the inception of that channel, actually cut it, cut the highlights and low 75 percent. Again, a lot of credit there. He is the highlight king and I handled some of the slick thumbnails now. The thumbnails had been fired lately. Our thumbnail game has been improving. Yeah, you guys got acquired talent. You're getting better and better at it, but that's our fourth million subscribed. Right? Pretty soon. Another button now the button can pawn off.

Speaker 4:          01:39:43       What were you going to say? And we did a toast that I feel like I peaked a little bit ago with Papa John Shooting Papa John in the back of the head. I don't know if that was ever done. Was really something. Yeah, exactly. Oh, we testing. Are we doing this? Should we test one? Ian's done. We can. Well, let's, let's enjoy some orange soda while you, uh, I don't want because you mentioned that. So as Ian Discusses his, um, is a best and worst we shall enjoy. Is this crystal what year? Vintage? A few thousand dollars. Because I don't know who drinks orange soda. It's probably been sitting on the shelf for about that long rosé right? Or is this your style? Rosacea?

Speaker 4:          01:40:31       This is a. What is this? Squirt Fanta. Nice Fruity Aroma and picking me up here. Go ahead and give you drink. You can have a little of that since you are pregnant, but not too much. That's probably true about soda. They're like, don't drink that shit if you're pregnant. Got To let it open up. Yeah, let it. Let it. Let it air out a little bit. I want to dive right in to that. Cheers guys to 1 million on the. On the. On the highlights, highlights and so a greater first 100 episodes together. Yes indeed. And thank you to all the viewers and listeners. I think that turned really tastes fucking online.

Speaker 4:          01:41:14       Does Sarah and Zach has a cup in the back? Are you guys doing this? We did a little backstage. Was Sara. Cheers guys. Look great to year to a great celebration of, you know, there's six people here that I really like. I guess that includes five. I'll let you decide. Count like, wait who? But who's left down by? Not including myself. Oh, okay. Office. Wait. Why are we confused about. No, we're not going to send it, right? Yeah. Six. Okay. If you had said you had said the wrong number and then left us includes you. Right? It's weird to say, I really like. I didn't mean to say that. Do people really like themselves? I don't love yourself. I know people say that. Yeah. I mean nobody. It's weird to be like say, okay. Regardless. He hit us, hit us with them names. I remember we were all panicking on this one because we had no idea what was going to walk through the door.

Speaker 4:          01:42:25       If Ethan Bradbury, we're going to just be like completely quiet. They're going to engage and then they turned out to be just absolute legends. There's a little back story actually because we didn't know what to expect. And um, somebody rolled outside to greet them. Was it un? Uh, it wasn't me. I think we saw out the window actually, isn't it? I don't think you could see where somebody went outside. I think, and maybe it was me, it was me. It was definitely me. I went out to go meet them and I saw them in the parking lot putting on the spiderman that's and I was like, oh my God. I came inside and I was like, oh my God, you guys are going to remember this? Oh yeah. I remember like we bought donuts before and make it their own. They were, they were. They knew what was up. They came to play, so we rolled out the carpet form here.

Speaker 4:          01:43:27       I think the only guest that ever got the red carpet treatment, by the way, why? I love the exact shot into the office or something, Kinda played the kids music. We were all obsessed with ethan trap area as I still am. Actually. Shout out to Cole songs, does his own thing. I was afraid that I was afraid that she's going to lay on the couch and it's like, oh shit. One of the guns come on my mind. I was like Spidey, such a clean up this damn city guys. That was a good moment. Yeah, that was pretty great. They were very, very onboard. Surprise, surprise you. That was the beginning of the turn, the paradigm shift in the life of Ethan Bradbury and Joe and mo Jo Malone Bradbury, because since then they've gotten full me mode to get complete extreme and now they comment on every instagram post that any of us ever made.

Speaker 4:          01:44:53       Since that episode. They will miss a single day. Don't miss the boats. They do not miss a post, and he always said he ethan wrights stuff that doesn't even make sense. He'll just go like slamming on everything. It's just, it's great. God bless his soul. You know, sometimes. I mean, I remember when you made the announcement, he actually was pretty sweet with his comment. That's true. Yeah. What did he say? It was just congratulating. You seem very real. Congratulations. There wasn't a slamming. Slamming me. We've got the profit. Yeah. This was when a doctor showed up, looked so good. Professor prophecies. Got To make a comeback. So this is when you introduced the Doc. He's someone who I respect and appreciate and I'm also going to take them out three times and I'm the prof and I'm here to profit the end of the dark. Dan Bring this coward, coward in county through is to look at this coward. How have a seat, because I'm the three times three time world champ. 90 seven 98.

Speaker 4:          01:46:15       He's so fucking tall. Three time, dude. Yeah, minecraft casual gaming. Okay. First of all, I have a castle in minecraft. If my bullies didn't come into my server and tearing down, you wouldn't be in an off. I replicated the TNG enterprise in minecraft and you're going to shit on that. That's why they call me the three times I did bring you some collector item tee shirts and I don't know if I even want to him to you. Now you've got a fat girl, a girl. Take a look at. Take a look at it. Frankly. I can't see you. I'm to. I'm going to put these down. You can't see it in the Google prototype scopes with originally got here. That was good. That was really fun. Yeah, that was just a fun. That was one of my favorite episodes. I think he was just so entertaining. I was so nervous about interviewing and because he's so deep in character that it was just.

Speaker 4:          01:47:14       I was afraid was gonna be a minefield of trying to get him to say anything interesting, but he actually, he, he, he did great. I mean he never broke character but, but he still managed to be kind of real. The Lens of the character. It was, it was good. Yeah, I enjoyed that. Yeah. So, uh, so another one that I had was when we had sean, Sean Evans, first gotTa chew you gotTa fucking beard and everything. Yeah. When I saw this I was like, oh yeah. You and Alex were getting creamed in the background. It was, it was rough. I was not anticipating while I was at the time because you now like spicy food because of this. Right. Look, this kinda like broke the seal. I remember it was, we knew this about Ian that he like never ate spicy food and then we forced like a hot cheeto would knocked me on my end. So you know, this was a big jump, but this was so fun because the taste is kind of pleasant at first.

Speaker 4:          01:48:18       It feels like I was teabag by Satan. It looks like you were to back, let's say, are you filling out crying? I was dying back there. That was rough. I was so fun. That was one of my favorite episodes because we have always been such fans of hotlines. And then to get actually got to pick his brain a little bit on how he interviews people. Um, that was actually, I think the first time I showed my face on the deal, we had the meme where we never saw your. Although we didn't really never shut like we've shown blown at once before. I think the. Or it was made by Joey Salad, a joey in his blog. He showed somebody on the subway. I was such an ancient. Me. I almost don't even remember. Now you're eating the powerpoint is the pace of the show at this. Basically we gave everyone had to deal with this, but yeah, I really. That was great. Doing a little mini hartland. Yeah, that was cool. Another I liked when Eric brought on his conspiracy closet segment broker clip. Oh yes. I love, love. Love this real quick. So keep an eye on now. This guy's a clone, he's about the glitch, the fuck out.

Speaker 5:          01:49:49       A certain amount of distance between the two on the right might also be clones. There is a lot. It's a big day or do the strangest things on his. On the history of what is happening. If you could say there's a pretty big weight go

Speaker 4:          01:50:17       because she's like, and it's such a weird face that it's not a natural relaxed look. Yeah. It's so weird, but it does seem like somebody said like his trigger word and he went into debug mode from them. I think the second off, it's true. Oh yeah, they intro. This segment is just so great.

Speaker 5:          01:50:39       No.

Speaker 4:          01:50:44       Whether we should get another episode going of ABC's until. That would be fun, man. Eric is always a blast to avalon. Yeah, he's a great president. It's time to reboot the conspiracy classes. Yeah. I didn't know it meant that much to you, but, but know to this day people constantly, but I'll see comments like please bring it back. It was so good. Yeah, we should. I really love how he prepared a segment. It was, it really worked. And uh, this was the, another squirelly one, but this was just to show the live episode we did, which I thought was one of the funniest, most enjoyable ones we've done, but also extremely stressful, you know? Oh yeah. You guys, you guys in the crew. I mean that was, it took so much work and you guys were grinding hard. It was all of that together. We had extra because it wasn't just do the live show is also streaming it, recording it all the first time ever doing it out of our studio, which I've done a lot to promote events.

Speaker 4:          01:51:45       So that was my job before I came and worked for you guys. But it had been awhile and I was used to working with like a production truck and like, you know, and, but uh, but we pulled it off. Maybe get closely with them on any hitches. Really. I will say the projector was a pain in the audio was fucking out of it. We're kind of Improv. Why do you guys have a $50 fucking projector? Just barely got time on the stage to get used to it now where before, but that's all right. We got kicked out of the venue. Yeah. Yeah. There were some circumstances that made it. For the most part, it was as smooth as you could hope for. But Zach was calling in as Jordan the fanboy. Yeah. And he was coming the projector. That's right. Yes, very much. Now I have nightmares about that one too.

Speaker 4:          01:52:40       I wasn't in control because we tested it beforehand. I don't work. Yeah, exactly. There's only so much you can do a. It was a such a fun, such a fun, fun time and so stressful. It was just too stressful. That's what we haven't done it again because we were like, that was amazing and I never want to do it again. Kind of. We did one and do it again, but we don't want to. It's. It's weird. We even had the idea of doing it once a month. I don't know. Oh my God. Oh yeah. Doing it as kind of a residency thing. I mean if we were maybe something considering the future because if we do it regularly then it becomes less of a thing, you know, you got a routine on how you do it and you get into a rhythm and it's not so bad.

Speaker 4:          01:53:21       So maybe someday in the future. I mean it was so fun. It really was fun. We all went out afterwards this out and like that. That was super fun. But the, the, the, the thing is like in the room that there was so much laughter and joy in the room and everyone, there were some really great energy, but when you watch the vod you don't really get to feel that because you don't hear the laughs and the crowd as much as we did in the room. Which that was another aspect is we, the venue did the audio and not that they did a terrible job, but they didn't necessarily have a audience mics. And so, you know, if we were to do it again, lesson learned like the Mike, we should, we should. Yeah. Maybe we'll do another one next year. It was. Oh, and there was a proposal of marriage, but you know what, we buy them again. We went. When we did kill Tony, they were in the audience. Oh, no way. And they came and said Hi. We're like, you guys are married now. That's awesome. Yeah. Trying to find the moment, but yeah, look at this guy is big. He's bragged. Judgment just came out with this. Damn that audio quality is seven years. This ties it all together here. I suspect if he wasn't such a troll he probably would be fine. Setting it up, playing a little meme that it's going to be nervous. Post was, I know a giant crowds, but this is a different vibe. But you had everybody lift up their cell phones.

Speaker 5:          01:55:02       Yeah, look at that. Great. California kind of these pretty precious animals. That's why we care so much about Bombay. So we had danny come into actually had cam. Awesome. Really well shot. If you could make $100,000,000 to go to jail, how much time would you do? Is this related to your situation? Totally over a hundred million dollars right now. I'm looking at a zero to six months, six months and no fine. It's so cold.

Speaker 1:          01:55:47       He lived the same way. He was locked up, meaning you can already lost last special round of applause. Good job. It was amazing. You feel so funny because like you have such a sympathetic audience, right? And they're there for you and they love you. So it's like, it's the best fucking crowd. I can only imagine trying to perform like the phone. Oh my God. I wish. I can only imagine trying to do jokes for people who don't know who you are. Tough game out there. Tough game. I think Sarah and put this one in the best or favorite moments or one of her? Least favorite. Actually, I'm not sure. I don't know. What is the thank you. Once again, a dead mouse. George Zimmerman.

Speaker 5:          01:56:54       I remember thinking this is why I haven't

Speaker 1:          01:56:56       straight up name phobia. That's the. I had it before that. When I say people's name, I get so stressed that I'm going to say the wrong thing. I had like a mini panic attack every time and I called him George Zimmerman, George Zimmerman. But right one, we were closed and the new album is coming out and fucking

Speaker 5:          01:57:17       George Zimmerman because that's Florida. Who killed a dude, man. That's funny as shit guys. Got It. Got It, got it. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:57:48       Oh Man. Great entry was one of them. One of my worst moments I think. Wait, those are condos. Yeah. So you won't go to his listening party where his fucking can go anywhere. Right here. I got him on stock X. I love shoes it and that way you can say it, but I buy, I buy the shoes that I really genuinely like. And are those puffy you have? Very. Yeah. Kanye west shoes or fucking, you know, our, our, our intern has fake easy song. Really.

Speaker 5:          01:58:31       Got It. I got to tell you, I was on the back happened.

Speaker 1:          01:58:37       He was legitimately crushed. I felt like I was out.

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       It took me out of the closet. I thought it was still new, like the was. I thought it was like an interesting point of conversation to note like, but then I was like, oh I shouldn't have. Because I forget that you're so in the Kanye community. Yeah. But did you feel betrayed? I guess so. I'm always like a rat in the community. Like I was banned from the floor. I couldn't get the real. I'm like screwing around in the walls, but Kanye fans so you know. But well okay, because there is a silver lining to that. What you're wearing right now as a result, as the outing in Adidas reached out

Speaker 1:          01:59:27       and hooked in up. No one else. No. No. So we're all gel. Actually. Let me riff, let me rephrase. They said we want to give you guys the eecs who's up first and I said it's got to be.

Speaker 4:          01:59:43       And in fact they haven't sent this anymore, you know, it was difficult. But we did get a pair and I am very grateful for that. So what, so let me ask you this, would you, are you happy that I added you or would you prefer to go back and erase that moment? Well either way I have yeezys like where I'm not added. Those are real everybody. So it's a win win, you know, it's a zero sum game, but I guess I have real ones now. You had real ones,

Speaker 1:          02:00:13       but they're not real. Let me ask you this. Are the real ones more comfortable than the fake ones? It's a different. He's different material, but how does it compare because you've got fake think are pretty comfy. Um, I think they're, yeah, they're comfier than the fake ones for sure. If the right thing to say. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:00:34       And I, and now I'm glad. I'm not going to find. I'm convinced now that his shoes are more available than, you know, there's no need to buy the fake ones. So if you see me in any other pair of the real, I don't look at, don't get too close. Very real easy. Bus is going to be all open. But those were my, uh, all of my moments best and worst. So, uh, yeah, that's it.

Speaker 1:          02:01:03       That was fun. Let's see what else we got here. Wow. Seen it all. We've done it at all. It was nice to remember two hours. Wow. That's a lot of talk about, you know. Well, we've got one other. Do we, are we going to take that call in from debunker real. Oh, let me go get it. While you're preparing that, I have a fan submission. Remember you can always submit to podcast at h three, h three productions.com if you have any question. Submissions is we want to, you want us to watch, etc. But this one can be

Speaker 9:          02:01:43       best and worst moments. People suBmitted a lot and it was very hard.

Speaker 1:          02:01:47       That was amazing. Thank you guys. But this one comes from jay dance in regards to our charity live stream and I thought it was, it was very sweet and addressed one of the points we were wondering about. So here, I'll read it a hello everyone at the age three. My name is j.dance and I'm a huge fan of the podcast and got into podcasting because of you guys. I'm writing you guys today, um, because of the charity event podcast you guys did yesterday with justin rolland and alex hirsch. I'm from paradise, California and most of my family friends have lost everything due to the campfire. I just want to say thank you for doing this charity podcast. It means so much to all of us. The suPport and help. And then she goes on. Oh, and one more thing you guys should, you guys talked about, um, one more thing you guys talked about what you would take if you had a chance to evacuate and most of you said dog, of course the media has given backlash towards people leaving their pets, which on paper I would have to.

Speaker 1:          02:02:46       The truth is when the fire head paradise, it was around 8:00 AM, 8:30 AM, so by that time most people had already gone to work or school and drop their kids off at school. Paradise being a small town, most people don't work in paradise and mute out of town and the surrounding cities like chico, red bluff reading, etc. So when the fire hit paradise and when it did hit it very quickly, people did not even have the time to go back to paradise to get their pets or any personal belongings because it was, you know, I wanted to share this with you guys and that does actually explain it. Anyway, thanks for being awesome people and I always looking forward to the show. Thank you so much jay dance. So that actually puts it even more in perspective because you go off to work or school, you don't even have a chance to get not only your pet but any of your belongings be so devastated. If I couldn'T go take care of shredder and you know that something's up

Speaker 9:          02:03:47       that makes art because I feel like a lot of the videos I watched were people were trying to drive back into it was because of their pets and I did wonder that. So yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:03:57       I mean god, that's so heart wrenching. Like to not to feel helpless like shredders in the house. Right. And you don't know if it's on fire. Like what? Like I don't, I would run into the fire. I guess that's what some people will try it. I mean it's just like such a betrayal and your poor pet is at home. Scared, confused looking for you. That's so devastating.

He's a big fan of the podcast we watched in a long time and he, um, during the donation stream donated a thousand bucks when you did the shout out to have a color, a call land, but he had an international number and our phone system, the phone system wouldn't let us get to them and so we had kind of a technical issue getting through to him. So to make it up to him, we're talking to them today. So here is phipps, right?

Speaker 12:         02:08:47       A resume call right now. Fifths.

Speaker 1:          02:08:56       Hey, what's up? Hey you. First of all, thank you so much. You've donated, you helped us get to a 100,000. Your legend. I'm sorry we didn't get to answer your call during that live stream, but I am

Speaker 13:         02:09:15       the whole, the whole gang. It was really crazy. The old podcast. It wasn't about the cost specifically. You guys are doing this for a great cause and I really appreciate what you guys are doing.

Speaker 1:          02:09:23       God bless. Thank you so much, man. You're doing it. I want to ask you, since we're in the spirit of sharing our favorite moments, do you have a favorite moment that, uh, as I, as, as a, as a audience member of the podcast,

Speaker 13:         02:09:40       I mean, you guys pretty much covered a lot. I mean, the ricky ticky tack, he was calling the church and he was going crazy with the boys. I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down. Like I didn't think that he would take it that far. I think it was like a little, you know, goof. And then he Just stopped. He just kept on going and I really love it.

Speaker 1:          02:10:02       Yeah. I was shocked watching that back today actually. How crazy that call was that later?

Speaker 13:         02:10:08       No, it was just really awesome. Like I really like, the thing is, is that what I love about the podcast itself is that, you know, you guys have this kind of formula going on, but you diversify in a way that you have always these new elements coming in. So you have ruined in a couple of times. Right? But every time he comes in there's something new added to the mix, like new elements, which is something as an audience member like, oh, we shit, you know. Damn,

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       thank you. That's awesome to hear you work hard. It is. Sometimes doesn't. Maybe it's not easy to spot, but we've, I mean we try, we work hard on the, on the show and I, and I'm glad to hear that, that you appreciate it. And we're working hard. I think. I'm hoping that um, when we come back for like one slash one plus the new season, I want to call it in a month, I want to redo a lot of things and kind of reimagine what we do here and freshen it up a lot. I've got some fun ideas and I'm like, well one thing we talked. Oh go ahead. What do you got for me?

Speaker 13:         02:11:12       No, it was just asking you about like, you know, cause you have two channels, right? So you got a little bit of the criticism about kind of like how you're balancing up the channels and everything. I don't only need to get into it too much, but like you're putting a lot of effort into the podcast, whIch is awesome, but like how would you balance out that effort with the main channel vh date? She productions.

Speaker 1:          02:11:32       So I think a misconception that people have is that my lack of uploads on h three, h three was due to me focusing my energy to the podcast when the truth of why I wasn't posting there had wasn't an issue of time or commitment or anything like that. It was really a result of not knowing what to do there or not feeling like I was in the right head space or having a lack of motivation or just a lot of negative bad feelings around posting there. So for me it's a lot of people were like, oh, he stopped posting there because the podcast is more lucrative and he doesn't care about his fans or whatever. Again, just kind of people always want to see the worst in it and like just assume the worst about people. But the truth of the matter is, and one that I'm addressing now as best as I can, is that I, I am and was depressed.

Speaker 1:          02:12:30       I mean I'm doing much better now I think, and something that I'm working on, but I had a lot of anxiety and a lot of issues, um, that I needed to resolve and a lot of it was manifesting itself through how I did my work there in my primary source of entertainment. And so the podcast was honestly a way for me to not disappear. It was a way for me to stay present and to still be working and to still share, share my life and be with our, with the people that want that want to continue to watch us. so for me the podcast was something to do while I sorted that shit out and it's been an incredible resource for me to come here and be able to share my thoughts and to not just disappear, right? Because that's not something I ever wanted to do. And so I, again, I just think it's a misconception because now we're back posting videos there and we're doing both and it's fine. I mean we're busier, but it's good. I like being busy and I like feeling productive and

Speaker 13:         02:13:37       well I really appreciate that. I think mental health is something that's really not addressed a lot in the media and the way that it is addressed. That feels a little bit underplayed. A, it almost seems as if it's like a, a capital brand capitalists brand. It's almost like something with the better health situation. Everything. I'm not going to pick it up again, but the thing iS, is that the way that you're taking it very head on and seriously, I think I can personally commend that. I admire a few hurdles in my life as well. Uh, but I feel as though also when you were talking about, you know, kind of facing an impasse indian year a uploaded, because I remember like when ray William Johnson stopped posting, you said something along the lines of he no longer feels gratitude and doing the same thing over and over again. So it got me thinking that if you keep doing the same type of style, the same formulaic technique, a, wouldn't you? Would you feel like less intellectually challenged by doing these videos?

Speaker 1:          02:14:33       Well, the truth is that I think so much of an even maybe what he's saying, so much of the negative feelings that you might feel is a symptom of a depressive state and not actually an expressive, an expression of like your creative art and that there's always a way to challenge yourself and there's always a way to make it fresh and interesting. The fact is that when you're depressed, you see everything through that lens. And so something I've learned about myself is that before I started actually treating my depression with medicine and therapy, is that you try, you scramble and scramble and try to address your depression because you don't. You don't know or you haven't accepted that you're depressed, right? So you're trying and in your Mind and in your life to address all of these different issues that, oh, that's why this and that's why that and that's why this, but the truth is you're never actually addressing the root problem.

Speaker 1:          02:15:29       You're addressing symptoms but never the root problem. So when you're depressed and you don't address that, you're always looking for some answer and you always to change. And the sad thing about it is that you're never going to fix it until you address the root cause. So for me, now that I'm feeling better, making videos is a wholesome thing and I'm content doing it. Where before I was always looking for something else, I was like, I need to make a show. I need to work on the podcast more. I need to get off you. I need, I need to do all these other things. But those were never the answer. Those were just me looking in vain for something to make me feel better because I didn't actually understand. But now that I'm in a better place, I can see that this is a good place for me. And it is a whole someplace for me and If you want to express yourself creatively, there's always a room within the formula you've created to, to find a good, wholesome, productive, happy place. It's just a matter of coming at it through the light lens. I mean, it really is a half glass, a glass half full half empty thing and when you're depressed it's sad is sadly is always half empty and you really just can never see the flip side of it. And so

Speaker 13:         02:16:41       the perspective is very difficult to see in a positive light. Yeah, I completely agree. So I want to make this a little bit. Uh, I didn't mean to drag the mood down,

Speaker 1:          02:16:51       never mind it. All the good questions. I'm happy to talk about it. You didn't drag it on if people were wondering the same thing. So it's good actually to talk

Speaker 13:         02:16:59       good about it. And since you know, we're, we're in the spirit of bringing up things at the end of the year. I thought maybe it would be a little nice mentioned, mentioned some of your best moments in terms of videos on hd productions. Right? I really love the a gold digger. It was, it was honestly a really nice highlight for me because, you know, I mean, all you did was literally say, you know, the, the guys just fucking following the woman. The woman was being completely honest, which is exactly true. And the thing is that repetition was, was the highlight of the whole video with it's the same thing over and over and over again. The cracks me up every single time, honestly.

Speaker 1:          02:17:44       Well, that's awesome. Thank you so much. That was a great one. That's great. Yeah, I liked it because it was, it was a little bit of a twist because I kinda resent all the gold digger content you see on youtube. I always thought it was just so ridiculous. And um, when you finally get to see inside this quote unquote gold digger relationship, you realize that he's the flyer and she's completely honest about her expectations in the beginning and he's the one that mess. Let her. Right. That was kind of a funny twist on the whole narrative of the gold digger.

Speaker 13:         02:18:20       Yeah, no. And uh, honestly, the thing is, is that it's. People look at things like specifically, you know, she's a gold digger, she wants money. That's a negative thing. He's the victim. Well, I mean, yeah. Well she said she's just literally saying that doesn't make it negative. It's negative when you're trying to deceive someone, not just achieve an objective was being hunches that, hey, this is what I want. Can you give it to me? Period? Just gave it to me right there. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:18:49       I don't even think she ever even pretended to love him and he's also an interest for her looks. Yeah. He wants her finger that wants to date a pretty girl, you know?

Speaker 13:         02:19:02       Yeah. You know, it's, it's. I mean it's her hustle, hustle, her, and then the first of all, the 90 day thing, it was never meant to work out. It's never about. It's 99.

Speaker 1:          02:19:15       He's watching this show and that show is heating season. Starting in so deep into data happening is unimaginable. People are saying it's the

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       darkest season ever and they're abandoning the show, but I'm totally suck then. No,

Speaker 13:         02:19:34       I heard that. That guy, the guy from the show got arrested

Speaker 2:          02:19:38       or they charge and I plug in. I called it too because in the show he's the guys walking around with backpacks of weed, you know, and then, and then a couple months later they're like, oh, we're in legal trouble. And I was arrested for having tons of weed and sure enough, he's in prison right now and it's pieces probably. Oh, she's been like lifting weights. You've seen her. She's all armed georgie. Boy,

Speaker 13:         02:20:07       look, if you're going to flex about business, I mean, come on, what do you expect to happen? You're going to

Speaker 2:          02:20:14       tv. And the funny thing is that he's a drug dealer that's not even that rich like kid. If you're going to do drugs, at least be richer than that.

Speaker 13:         02:20:25       There's two levels of pathetic, right? There's, there's, there's, you know, the crummy drug dealing, yada, yada. But then there's, you know, pretending to be a successful one at that to pretend to be a successful loser. you know, that's just, it. Just pick it for me like that. And honestly, I just wanted to also tell you that, you know, your commentary style, everything you've done for the past high. No, I don't have the exact number of years, but you've been doing. It's really awesome. it kind of pushed me to start my own youtube and everything. So I had a little, a few questions before I do my shameless plug in. Before I get there, I have some genuine questions for you. So what, since we're at the end of the year, this is also kind of a little did retrospective, what first motivated you to make these videos?

Speaker 2:          02:21:14       Um, well I knew that I wanted to work in comedy for a long time Just because it was something I was always passionate about, but I Really never, I didn't have any connections. I didn't know anyone and I didn't have any experience making comedy. So um, I think I've mentioned this before but, but well either we made a couple of videos for els class and it was really fun and I, And I actually thought I had a knack for it even though they weren't good or they're very weird, but I really enjoyed the process. So for me it was kind of started as just a creative outlet and kind of honing my craft and figuring out my style and I'm just slowly turned into having a youtube channel, which is funny because when we started making youtube videos I didn't even know you to being a youtuber was a thing. I am, we just posted it there but we didn't know like, yeah, it, it, it, it was just basically a hobby that somehow slowly started turning into something serious.

Speaker 13:         02:22:21       But I guess she had had some kind of continuous motivation at the beginning of youtube. The idea of monetization was just this abstract, you know, far away thought. Right. So you were doing it based on personal ambition, personal, I guess ambition to succeed in this industry which is youtube.

Speaker 2:          02:22:39       Well, my original idea was that I was like making a portfolio because at best I thought, hey, I could be a writer or something for comedy. So I was just thinking of youtube as a stepping stone of kind of just building a portfolio and honing my craft and just as a hobby to do that, I don't have anything better to do. So I, I was thinking of it in the beginning as a portfolio, something like that and be like, hey, if I could make a couple of funny videos, then maybe I can get a job somewhere.

Speaker 13:         02:23:14       I made a lot of people from college humor. That's what they did, you know, the, uh, it became writers at the daily show, stuff like that. I completely get you. I'm fair enough, I guess, uh, you know, first of all, I, I know this is, this is a little bit of a funny story concerning your name. I'm from Saudi Arabia and we have this weird thing with the language. Basically the letters and the numbers. Some numbers because we have different letters, right? It's an arabic. So some letters are expressed witH numbers and when I was trying to plug your channel to everyone I guess in school when I was a kid I would just say h three, h three and the thing is is that when they read that it says everyone sounded like, you know, like fat albert and it was so weird like that alberta getting, having a stroke or something or the other. So basIcally I was plugging it everywhere and people thought I was spasming.

Speaker 4:          02:24:13       How do you say it in like a

Speaker 2:          02:24:15       and what an arabic. How do you say it?

Speaker 13:         02:24:19       What do you mean? Like how were you saying it? I said h three, h three, but I would send them

Speaker 4:          02:24:24       texts or read it. So how would they read it? They would say like bill cosby. Memorable. But yeah, honestly you've been a great inspiration to me. I don't have anything else to say. I just have a few messages I wanted to say. I hope you don't mind. So you're calling right now from Saudi Arabia. Oh yeah. I'm calling you guys from Saudi Arabia. Interesting that you guys have a huge fan base here. Interesting how interesting. I can tell you every country then, is there anything weird

Speaker 2:          02:25:11       is going on with like politically like um,

Speaker 4:          02:25:17       you can't talk about that. Yeah, I can talk to you about like, well, I can tell you some good stuff. Can't tell you the best

Speaker 13:         02:25:24       stuff I can tell you about the uh, you know, uh, they had the first concert with mixed like, you know, the men and women used to be segregated and that just, they just had the first concert with black ips. David gets, uh, they, they removed the segregation between men and women, whiCh is a huge thing.

Speaker 4:          02:25:41       Interesting. Have you been, have you been outside of Saudi Arabia?

Speaker 13:         02:25:47       Uh, yeah, totally. I'm actually, I studied in the uk. I'm just back for christmas break and uh, you know, I've been to, I've been to New York, I've been to boston, I've been, I've been, I mean for visiting, I've been a lot around, but you know this,

Speaker 4:          02:26:03       the government is pretty tight there, right about like internet usage and stuff.

Speaker 13:         02:26:08       I mean it's, it's, I guess porn does. The only thing you can't use.

Speaker 4:          02:26:17       No wonder. No wonder people. I mean, shit, that's why people watch your videos, man. It's the next best thing. So when we see a combine, I did this. It's not a joke, you know, you get the urge, you can open your eyes. You'll. So let me ask you this. Are people in Saudi Arabia getting all are, do they jerk off to like this like you know, or the video we made like the egg sandwich video. Is that like good for. That's the top search. That's the good kid in Saudi Arabia. Is that what people be at all? But you probably used the h three but you use that. You probably use a vpn, right? If you're trying to find some good shit.

Speaker 13:         02:27:11       Let's be real. I mean in terms of upn usage, it's not even like hidden like people use vpn regularly because the thing is that it used to be the case that like, stuff like whatsapp call is banned. It's not that you can't call people, it was only band because the, the, the main conglomerate, uh, didn't want competition. They just want to people. It wasn't even like a censorship type of deal. Just didn't want any company, but then they decided like let's just have a. What's it called? Like a competent competitive market. so you know, just stay unblended and yeah. What's up calls back? That's a huge stride after a woman driving.

Speaker 4:          02:27:53       I use whatsapp all the time to call Israel. I'm just imagining not porn. I mean be. I would definitely be on youtube. There's some weird pornographic videos on youtube that we always make fun of. I would be there naked yoga. I just see. I just need all the seat, a little bit of side boob and I'm coming in my pants a little more sympathy for them.

Speaker 13:         02:28:16       Oh you got, you got, you got what's it? There'll be frank and maximo doing videos and you want us to look for

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       the site? That's enough. They don't overlap. I need both. Give be both. What have we got? A filthy frank w, w, w. Would that be good? Come on into my pants at the thought of it. So what's your, what do you want to plug your channel? Yeah, you were just going to do it I think.

Speaker 13:         02:28:43       Uh, okay. So first of all, my friends really insisted that I say this message, so sophia gagliano supports and loves you and shredder really wanting
