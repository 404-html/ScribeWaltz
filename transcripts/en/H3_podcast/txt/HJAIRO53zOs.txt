Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay. Coming to you by three. Welcome everybody to the h three podcast, Tuesday edition. Otherwise known as holy and lighten. Correct. Opinion Zone. You plan on disagreeing with me or arguing with me? God is not an option. I'll close it because I do want you all watching the numbers are important, but just know before warrant you are wrong because this is the correct opinion zone. Today's episode is sponsored by 23 and me, quip and seat Geek. Guess what's going down a week from today, Bill Burr, the living legend, the Titan of comedy, one of the greatest comedians of all time. Is it going to sit right where Isla is right now?

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       Okay, I'm fucking terrified.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       Bill bird is going to be here on Tuesday. Also important to note is that today is young shredders a birthday. He turned one years old, so let's keep

Speaker 2:          00:01:08       the roundup upload going.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       We are going to be playing everybody's favorite game. Know your meme featuring the one and only shoon eyes. That's right. Shoe and ice is back in a big way. Call us in at eight Oh eight hot meme. They, yes, that is our real phone number and yes, we are taking calls. They're eight oh eight hot mean. Ooh. Speaking of hot, I've been having diarrhea. A lot of diarrhea. Labor Day. No hot. Well No, the, the poop is hot like I northera. Yeah. Got It. Yep. Why is diarrhea hot by the way? Like I never had a chance to let you know. When you bake bread, you're supposed to let it cool and like, yeah, go room temp. So that's what diarrhea is. It's pooped that never got it. Never got to go room temp. But that's why it's hot under cooked. That is the scientific poop is what diarrhea is.

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       I eman happy Labor Day. Hope you guys all had a nice break. I had one too many hot dogs or something cause I've been having diarrhea since 4:00 AM then really pooping my brains out. What's the deal with Labor Day, by the way? TheF that fricking mailman's walking around delivering mail yesterday. I'm like, oh Labor Day, Labor Day. Federal employees don't even get the damn day off. Labor Day. What the hell? What are we celebrating if the mailman can't go, you know, take a seat. That's weird. I find that really very bizarre. Just like decided to work on his own. I don't think it works though. Federal government, I don't think you just pick up your mail bag and just start passing out envelopes. Cheryl was a Usbs, s u s p. S cause there's those Amazon guy. You know what? I'm not sure. I didn't see him pull man.

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       Oh Isaac. Well either way it's like, you know, late Labor Day, everyone who gets labor day off or like white collar workers, you know the real people that need labor day off are the ones that are like slaving away at Amazon and Mcdonald's and all these shitty jobs. Right. It's just so funny. Labor Day has turned into such as a stupid day. Labor Day was originally made to celebrate unions and celebrate like worker rights and shit and like meanwhile you got the post man and around envelopes. Well that's enough about Labor Day. The real takeaway is that diarrhea is under cooked poop. That make sense guys? Let's get started. We got a lot to talk about. Me Royale is coming to fruition. Ksi Versus Logan. Paul. Everyone was saying, oh that's the fight of the year, but in the century Nivea in the fight of the year because we are in the early stages of organizing what is going to be known forever as meme royale 2018 because this my friends is an annual event.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       We've got people that are in so far. Joey Salads, prank invasion, shoon ice there Bradbury's so flow all squaring off hundred thousand dollars of prizes. I think the big, the big fight should be prank invasion was joey salads and then I think a great undercard would be shooting ice. Fourth verse Ethan Bradbury, which be the battle of madness because they're both a little crazy and I know shoot nice is like over the hill so to speak, but he terrifies me and by the way he's been working on, he looks really good. People are going to place bets like sure, why not? It's loss of it. I mean I'm not going to take bets but somebody will, you know, it's crazy. I'm sure there'll be a spread if we so guys get excited me Maura out 2018 is happening. I want to see colby person getting his hands dirty. Is Faces too pretty whenever Jeff, God, coby person.

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       Who would you, I would like to see koby vs like Mo cause you know, I was originally thinking and then they see tv. Oh that's a good matchup. I originally wanted to pit Ethan Bradbury verse Moe Bradbury, like the the boys. But I think, I think Ethan would smash him. You can't contend with the smell, that pure madness that is behind his eyes. Like you even see in their videos when Ethan's like intimidating Mo and I was like, damn, he would never have a chance. So we'd have to pit moe against someone like Dennis. Yeah, that would be pretty hot. Super excited about that. In fact, guys, uh, you may have been following the story as it's been evolving here on this h three podcasts, a correct opinion episode. We've had it up a little bit of a altercation with prank invasion. Who called me out to box me, which was the, you know, I want to say, how would you say the, the breaking point for this meme right out cause prank invasion challenged me to a battle. And of course that's not something that I'm interested in doing, seeing is that I'm a pudgy little guy and prank invasion literally just got out of prison for three years for some kind of sexual crime. Um, that is not well, it's literally, well I don't know what I mean. No, it's, it is a joke. I didn't try. It is a joke. What I'm saying. Do I need to say that every time?

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       Maybe once guys. I do not think, I'm not saying that it's, I wouldn't be surprised. Can I say that if you went to prison for a sexual crime, you can say that. That's not, that's not definitely, I wouldn't be surprised if I want to be surprised at all. I'm anticipating it. Um, so he, he edited this footage together of what I said last episode and he said, respect to h three h street productions for admitting he's scared. Takes a real man to admit that respect, bro. Now send me your address to the podcast and I'll actually play you a quick game for a quick kiss. Ooh, dude, this guy wants to come to our podcast. I mean, shit is so demanding and his tweets now quit playing. I mean, here's the thing, dude. And I send me your address. Well, I don't know how we, I don't know how he, yeah, I'm scared of you. I'm scared of you. That's not like, that's not like unmanly to admit that I'm scared of some unhinged psychopath who serve roid it up and just got out of prison for a sexual crime. Like if you, if you walked by some on unhedged lunatic with like a hell's fire between his eyes under his, behind his eye is not crazy. It'd be like, Yo, I'm scared. Scared of you dude. Um, and not, I mean, and, and it's because you're insane.

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       You know, let's get it straight then. You're not a man, you're not a man face like I'm not. Okay, well anyway, let's just watch this. His little edit here,

Speaker 3:          00:07:52       bro. You look like you've disappeared for a year and and you were in prison and you've been lifting weights that whole time. Like the last video you may have. I was scared. I was scared. I was scared. I was scared. I was scared. This guy was in prison for a year,

Speaker 1:          00:08:05       Bro. You literally repeated me saying, I was scared that you were in prison for a year for a sexual crime and we're lifting weights that whole time. I am scared that you want to come to the podcast and kiss me. I'm terrified of all these things and I openly admit it. If that makes me less of a man that God bless. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       I wouldn't be surprised at all if that guy went to prison for a sexual crime within the next couple of months. That's not defamation. Right. The joke, cause I could see some people start, I could see some rumors starting to pile up that Chris went to prison for a sexual crime. Yeah. Chris went to prison for a sexual crime. Mila, it's a joke. He didn't, but I wouldn't be surprised. That's all I'm saying. Do you think I'm insane? Do you think that's my skill that I would get in a ring with you and fight you? I mean he, he's veins were like searching.

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       It's like what did you do to be imprisoned for the past two years to be that lucky? He sees that as a compliment. He's like, he thinks I'm so jackie themselves in prison for two years. Well at any rate, Chris, I would definitely like to play you for a quick game for a quick cast. And I think that could be a special segment at meme royale in 2018 quick game for a quick kiss bonus edition or you're going to play a rock, paper, scissors. Can you imagine kissing Chris? His breath is probably so gross. I bet you hear his tonsil stones. I was just worried about the noise. It's more than anything a host stay in with people just listening to me. You can think that I'm gonna make that noise with Emmylou naive. We should bring, you know, it would be funny, you know how you have these a ringside models at boxing matches. If we brought one of these girls to do a quick game for a quick Kessler then into the mic, that'd be fucking epic. Ila seriously on down anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       so yes, I am scared of you. Good job. Prank invasion. You freaking ski. You'd scare the hell out of me. Now interestingly, Joey Salads is on the phone. Who was gone? Who? Joey has challenged prank invasion to a fight. I think it's going to be a really good fight. Did did brink frank invasion. Acknowledged Jolie's yes. Challenge. It took some time. It took some finagling, but we have actually lined them up and I think this is something that is going to happen. At first it was really hard to tell. I had answered in response to this fight, Joey sells my money's on salad all day and the thought of you getting Mommy Makeout Dade, buy a salad head keeps you up at night. And then he said, you want me to put 100,000 on it? I said, apps a fucking Lulea put 100,000 on it. It goes to the winner. Winner takes all those guys are going to be out for blood. It's a morale 2018 where were you when the salads fell? Now he's this good. It would be a real fighting and like, or like fake fighting. What he was this wpf frank's fake fighting this, I mean $100,000 on the line till the winter.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       I'm not saying one is better than the other. Like I mean I'm not faking shouldn't be on you want to fake it. I just can't believe like people will actually hurt each other. Well like Logan k assignment, they're wearing gloves. Yeah. Well this is, this is one again. Joey Salads sent me this dm and I cleared it with everybody to get the permission to show this. So Joe was trying to talk frank invasion and to having fight. And again, this is why Brag of Asian scares the hell out of me because this guy is so unhinged that I wouldn't be surprised if he went to prison for a sexual crime within the next couple of months. Joey said, have you been training? And I had a box. So anyway, he says, are you going to do it? Prank invasion says, I'm thinking, not boxing, but nna no gloves cage to bare knuckle fight. We sign waivers and the fight last until someone gets knocked out. Unconscious gives up or dies. We'll need lawyers like this guy is, I mean I can't tell if he's serious, but that sounds like the worst of us have an absolute lunatic. He said, dude, that's just too, that's at least wear gloves. I got joey's actually entertaining, not entertaining. Do you not watch the h three podcasts live correct. Opinion zone for content just as this I asked who is entertained right now, Joey Salads and preg vague and bare knuckle fight to the death.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       Joey Salads, first

Speaker 4:          00:13:01       prank invasion cage. Fight to the death. We need lawyers and wave

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       whoever thought we would get to this point. But down all being said, we've talked enough about it. Let's see what the salad man has to say about this. Joey Salads, you are on the air and are you scared? Like I am of Prank invasion.

Speaker 4:          00:13:24       I am. I'm scared for his life. He's going to have to sign a waiver before the spike in case I accidentally kill off. You think that you've got what it takes to take out roided out prank invasion? Yeah, a little crazy. You know more than a little crazy. But how joey,

Speaker 1:          00:13:44       you seen his physique and his new videos, he's clearly disappeared and he's been lifting weights and he's been getting a little crazy. Have you seen this?

Speaker 4:          00:13:53       I have seen it. It doesn't frighten you? It newbie gains. Okay. We just started working at La Newbie gains and I'm joey, you had mentioned to me, uh, something about him wanting to fly out and fight you. Is this something that you guys are going to be doing off camera, separate funds? I don't think so. It just sounds stupid. Fight to the death. I told them at least let's do the boxing match first and then fight today. Now what do you think now? What's your take on preservation? Joe? Do you think he's being serious? What has happened? Because he's winning from Kissing Cutie's on the boardwalk to literally wanting to have a death match. What has happened in the world of Prank invasion? Joey, can you tell us? You know what, I can't tell cause I was friends with him for like a week, like two years ago. I friends with him for a week and he seemed kind of normal. But then he was telling me he uh,

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       he suffered from low testosterone. So we needed a, the bouncer on an enhancement. But I think he just started taking those and that might be making a move this down mine. Cause I know some people, they lose their minds when they started taking my performance enhancing stuff. So,

Speaker 4:          00:15:07       so you're dealing with science possible. They think he's learned this testosterone to levels that are unstable.

Speaker 5:          00:15:15       Yes. That's what I believe.

Speaker 4:          00:15:17       That is fascinating. Now are you going to be able to contend with that massive overload of male testosterone? Joey, are you going to have to come around with your own testosterone and Steroids Brown?

Speaker 5:          00:15:25       I've, I've, I've got, I've got my own necessity. Softer on that should be sufficient.

Speaker 4:          00:15:31       And um, you had told me an anecdote about how he has a secret technique that he did. He beat up a bunch of dudes on camera reset. He didn't want to show you the video. Do you have my information on that? And if you could stop washing dishes, that would be good for the show. You kept me on the live in 30 minutes. I started cooking. So now I gotta clean my daily. You're alive when you're saying nick, can you just, can you hold off cooking a meal? I mean, Jesus, come on man. This is our moment here. We, we, we, we prepared for this. What are you cooking guy? What are you preparing? Hopefully it's something. I got it. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:16:06       Hard. I got my protein. Yes. I'm already trained and I got like training and like an hour right now. And he's doing meal prepping. Yeah, I got a hard boiled eggs. I got a Turkey Patty,

Speaker 4:          00:16:20       sorry. As much as I'd love to hear more. I did ask, but that's enough of that. I've heard enough of your meal tech right now. Tell me about this video. That creek invasion. He says there's a secret video of him beating up several people by himself now. Joey, tell me about this video.

Speaker 5:          00:16:38       I would give him $1,000 cash if you would send it to me cause I don't think it exists

Speaker 4:          00:16:42       cause you had asked him, send me the video. He said, I don't want you to see my sacred technique. He said that verbatim, which made me think that it's kind of a kissing prank thing of like my secret technique.

Speaker 5:          00:16:54       Yeah, so it kind of sounded like, I think maybe what he did was he tried to get into a fight with someone and try and kissing them and, and then just ran away.

Speaker 4:          00:17:03       Very interesting. Third technique to do. Is there any other closing words, any words that you have for Prank invasion? Anthony would like to say we'd like to cast the gauntlet. Any accusations and slander about him being a sex criminal that's been in prison for the last one. Would you like to add before we say goodbye and let you cook your meal there that you're so eager to cook

Speaker 5:          00:17:28       is if he bails out, I'm going to be pissed and you're going to be a bitch because he's been kind of flaky with this whole thing. Trying to go from boxing to taste, death, nine sliding, fighting. He's a flaky guy. I don't, I can't tell if he's trolling or if he's actually that weird.

Speaker 4:          00:17:46       So there's $100,000 on the line and I got to Chris. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       you know, your channel has not been holding up strong lately. Lots of citations. Um, and I think that $100,000 is a lot of money for any man. No matter how many girls he's kissed. Am I right joey? Okay, well, I'm excited. Everyone is on the edge of their seat. This is what it's all about here at the HBCU podcast. Joe, we love you. We love having you be part of the show. You're don't forget to eat those salads. I know that you're not a fan of salads, but it's important to cover up. Joey, how do you get fiber when you're preparing for it to be, to be in healthy shape? Seeing that you don't eat salads at all? Well, how do you get your fiber, Joey?

Speaker 1:          00:18:33       Joey, I'm f. Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure, but I'm not sure. I'm not sure that's a sufficient, not one to talk, but I am also not training for the century. Um, how many hours a day are you trying to joey? Three for three. Four hours a day. Wow. That's impressive. That's very good. That it was a lot. Now are you afraid that prank vision being a little bit of a mad dude is, might be go for a ear bite or something of that sort? That's what I'm worried about. I'm going to, I'm going to tape my ears down the ears down. I like that. That's a good idea. Better safe than sorry. Right? Well, with $100,000, you can buy yourself a new ear.

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       Joey, we thank you. We wish you all the best. Keep training, keeping that bread. The fiber is important. I recommend metamucil, which is a great fiber supplement that was recommended to me by a friend has helped me out a lot and I wish you all the very best. Joey, thanks for giving us a ring. Thanks. All right Joe had God bless you and keep, keep uh, keep fighting. All right, you're the best. Well there you have it, Joey Salads in the flush. Now just to summarize joey, he's thinks he's going to win. I think Joey's going to win. He has accused prank agent of taking testosterone which has made him kind of, I want to say a rage filled mania hasn't resulted in and he is, he has called out prank of Asian and said if you flake you're a bitch. He said, and I believe something else.

Speaker 1:          00:20:13       Something else. We know that he's flagging cause we tried to do it then know your meme. And he was like right, I'm going to do it. And then he never responded. Well, I think what we need to do next is basically draft a contract between these two that locks them in a obligates and basically if he, if brank invasion backs out of the contract, what's going to happen is that I'm going to be in contact with his probation officer and we're going to make sure that those sexual crimes he has committed or not going to be expunged and are going to remain on the sex offender website for a long, long time. Just a joke. But we should, we should get a contract with, they'll go with the guys. Yeah, but the thing is even with the outbreak invasion, we still have a great fight because shoon ice is going to tear someone's head off their body. Um, how are we doing on time? I guess we got a little more time here. Time. We actually, here's some great footage up next. I got a lot to talk about before we throw it to commercial. Let's watch Ted Cruz now. Ted Cruz. I don't know what the situation, here's what he's in a church of all places playing hope and man, Oh man,

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       can he throw a rock and by throw a rock, I mean drops like a rock here. Let's have a look. No sound. So here he is prep in. He's about to take a run that's travel. He's not dribbling and he tries to dunk it off a trampoline and boy does he just follow up. No, I mean like a bag of dirt bag that we do that again. Yeah, I hear you have ted Cruz taking a running jump at a trampoline to try to dunk the ball at a church down the center lane. I don't know. You call that a church. The pupils, the poeple's. How do you, what do you call those seats? Pews? The pews full. I think they are just in prayer praying for Ted Cruz to hit a slam dunk. But the prayers were not answered and he's straight the hell it looks like the devil literally stuck them down. You're like the Fi's grabbing dropped basketball and a harder than gravity allow. I love it. So anyway, shout out to Ted Cruz who, yeah, by all accounts is hated by all, but nobody could ever say he's a bad basketball player. Next up here on the podcast, we've got three Therissa may the British PM dancing.

Speaker 6:          00:22:52       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:22:53       And my dude, thank you. Let me get with it folks. I'm actually going to Africa and doing this. What the heck is that white as shit I've ever seen in my life. See, I'm, I'm conflicted. On one hand, I don't know if I can be like, hey, you know what you're making an effort to.

Speaker 1:          00:23:20       Yeah. So like, that's admirable, right? Yeah, it is fun. I think it is. Okay. I mean, that is, that's like, you know what it reminds me of is that episode of Seinfeld dancing. It's that weird. It's weirder. I think he's with her hands. She's like climbing and that hair, it's like her body is broken. She's like climbing at the air and man, it's like, it's bad. But I guess, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:23:49       Alan Ball, the cheese out there. I don't know anything about her, but it makes me think, makes me like her. She, there's where you're like, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:23:56       cool. Can I have a George Bush kind of thing where it's like, you know, as a person,

Speaker 4:          00:24:01       I don't, I don't know anything about that either. But here's more of her dancing.

Speaker 6:          00:24:08       He's getting in there

Speaker 4:          00:24:11       less western, those hips. She looks like she's hurting sheep or somebody who's like, right. There you go. What is it when you watch someone dance that you have to like try to dance? Remind me I'm ever in this situation. Just smile and nod. It's kind of a lose lose. You can't be all right if you're just standing there, you're like, Hey Paul. Yeah, I, you know what? God bless her. Right? You crushed it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:48       That one's not nearly as good as the first one with the client. Get the air. The climbing move was something I'd never seen before. I was a freshman. Um, anyway, off to good start. Are we entertaining here? What? Boy? So I guess that's been about 30 minutes, hasn't it? So I'll throw it to a quick commercial break. We got back Logan Paul verse case, I copyrighted our highlight. I'm going to rant about that bullshit. We got Pewdie pie versus t series TV series about to pass Petey Pie and sub count. Who the hell is t and how do they have so many views and subscribers? We're going to dig into that and so so, so much more new pit bull video with a dancing frog. You're not going to believe this is real. It is guys, you are watching the h three podcasts, correct? Opinion zone do not go away because my dudes that would be wrong and here we are right all the time. Stay tuned.

Uh, today we've got a special presentation put together of know your meme, featuring the one and only shoot ice. We've got a caller on the line here. Let's get started. So, uh, let's say it on two G. Gee.

Speaker 4:          00:32:41       Oh, you're welcome to though. [inaudible] Joe, how are you doing today? You have a fantastic, even better now I'm talking to my favorite couple on youtube. Oh, thank you joe. You're too kind too kind. Do you know? Nice. I get ready to win a Samsung Galaxy as by blah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       Oh hell yeah. Let's do that. Alright. I, you've met Shu and I said before, tell me about that interaction if you yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:33:16       so, uh, it was 2011, uh, I was a freshman at State University of New York at Albany, uh, and Mr Shoe. Nice. Kind of hijack a, the cancellation of one of the biggest student events by changing himself to a fountain in the middle of our campus. Uh, he wear diapers to go to the bathroom and he didn't eat for, oh, it was probably at least four or five days.

Speaker 1:          00:33:40       Now. Can you tell me why? Wow.

Speaker 5:          00:33:45       So the biggest party of the year at that school is a, it was fountain day when they were turned on the fountain in the spring. Everybody would go in and it's a good giant pool party. But for Saint Patrick's day, there's another, uh, unsanctioned event called the kegs in eggs, uh, which is just basically everybody wakes up at eight o'clock in the morning and starts drinking. Uh, so long story short, a few police cars were flipped over. People were on top of cars playing bagpipes, real shit show. Um, so they ended up actually canceling the Fountain Day Event and Shoe Nights, uh, who claim to be a student, uh, tandem stuff to the fountain. And nobody really at that time kind of knew who he was. I don't even know if he had the following. Now I'm going to be had the following now, but

Speaker 1:          00:34:32       I am slightly confused. His, he protesting the event or the cancellation of the event,

Speaker 5:          00:34:38       the cancellation of the event, he, uh, he claimed to be a student would shove

Speaker 1:          00:34:44       with a little bit interesting because you can sell you the most of the students. So you said he changed himself and he shit himself in a diaper and fasted for four to five days. What did he achieve a success in his hunger strike?

Speaker 5:          00:34:57       No, I think he was actually forcibly removed it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:01       Oh, probably, but we did not have mountain day that year. Uh, he tried, but did you leave? Did you have the opportunity to meet this great man and talk with them and say, shoe, tell me about what you're doing. Can I smell it? Your diaper. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:35:16       Nobody really knew that he was the guy. He didn't tampons on Youtube. Some warrior, you know, fighting for the little did they know that just came up there. He was chained up there in his giant gear. Just, you know, screaming at anybody who walked by. He got all the local press to pay attention to them.

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       Um, that's

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       visited him once or twice. That story

Speaker 1:          00:35:40       definitely lines up with the shoe. Nice. We all know and love. No problem. Stretching my imagination to believe. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:35:47       Joe, we've got you here. We are ready to go

Speaker 1:          00:35:51       play. Let's just get right the F intuit and start with the first question. So Lube up, get ready. Shotgun. A bottle of alcohol. Let's start with question one.

Speaker 7:          00:36:08       Joe Is the weirdest thing shooting and ice has eaten. Is it a, a bottle of k, y Jelly, anal. Lou Anal, not normal. Vaginal. There is a distinction. I want you to be aware of being tampon soaked and hot sauce joe or see a bar of deodorant. The choice is yours, Joe.

Speaker 5:          00:36:38       Oh Shit. The weirdest. That's objective.

Speaker 7:          00:36:41       That is hit and his opinion, this is in his

Speaker 8:          00:36:45       opinion.

Speaker 7:          00:36:46       Well you, your job is not to seek truth. Joe. I remind you, it is to get into the mind of the shoe himself. That what size is that shoe and does your head fit into it? That's the strip. We are running out of time. You have 20 seconds. Joe.

Speaker 5:          00:37:04       I pumped and Pantheon was blood, but I'm going to say the deodorant.

Speaker 7:          00:37:08       See the weirdest thing shooting ice has ever eaten. See Deodorant.

Speaker 1:          00:37:17       This is really anticlimactic, but I don't have the folder open with that answers. Just uh, just everyone chilled back.

Speaker 5:          00:37:31       I ever ate was probably a tube of k. Why Jelly? Anal lubricant close first with three tampons dipped in a hot dog.

Speaker 1:          00:37:40       Joe, I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed that a bar of deodorant sat next to anal lube and a tampon soaked in hot sauce. They found the deodorant feed the least bizarre or the most bizarre, the three of those. But that just shows what a decent kind hearted a man you are. Now I remind you, the objective is to get into the shoe itself. So going forward, we got more questions. You know, we've got to get into the shoe, Joey with us.

Speaker 5:          00:38:11       Alright. I gotta get more depraved. Let's do it.

Speaker 1:          00:38:14       Yeah, you've got to get into this shoe. So here we go. Question number two. That's fine. We've got plenty more to go.

Speaker 7:          00:38:21       What did she nice tell ilow that prompted her to tweet this. Isla said to him, slam some more toilet paper to clean the shit that's becoming out of your mouth. What provoked this from Ula? A shoot. And I told her her clothing line sucks. B, he called her and Israeli whore or see, he said he wanted to eat our dog shredder. Joe, enter the shoe.

Speaker 5:          00:38:55       That's the one I know he called you the Israeli horror and I'm so sorry. That's horrible.

Speaker 7:          00:39:01       And you're sweet. You're a sweet, sweet man. Joe, we appreciate the, uh, the sympathy. So let's go to the, uh, answer books itself. Be called her and Israeli horror. Gotta be a little more slick and prompt these up Mara. Time. There we go.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       This is real fucking this up.

Speaker 5:          00:39:24       Okay. Well what happened is I was my drinking days, I've been sober since last Christmas. He by the enemy had talked down an email and I was heading out to California and Nathan's like, it would be great for us to get together. And I emailed Ethan a few more times and it came up, you know, he wouldn't reply to me and I was just like, well can you let me know within the day? And then I uh, I was just on twitter and I'm a ball buster, so I just, you know, I said, hey, you left, you know you're a Jewish whore. And I mean, no, I'm sorry, you're an hour from Israel. That's what I said. If she was from Tennessee, do would have been a horror from Tennessee. But yeah, I'm not, I'm not ready. I wanted to take that back so bad. I mean, I was literally, I don't even remember typing it to be honest.

Speaker 1:          00:40:10       Wow. Joe, you are correct in this point, but I actually, I want to correct the record.

Speaker 2:          00:40:14       [inaudible] was shooting ice. What happened, I think was that

Speaker 1:          00:40:18       he wanted to come on the podcast and he had emailed me and it was like so tentative. He was like, Hey, I'm coming through La. Uh, maybe I'll pop in and we can do a podcast or something. And I was like, I was like, sure, I'll let, I'll let you know something like that. Then he think about it or sometimes not. And then he emailed me like 20 times and weirded me out and I was like, oh, fucking shoe. And Isis were crazy. I didn't get lucky, dude. I hadn't yet learned to harness that power. It scared me, but I did. I needed to learn to harness the power of his star as Thor's hammer does. Um, so then he just went railing on us one, nine twitter. That being said, Joe, you were correct. You are on the board.

Speaker 2:          00:41:02       The one, we're all very excited. How are you feeling? You feeling good? Feeling confident? Oh hell yeah. We'll do it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       Samsung Galaxy s nine plus with a retail valuable $1,000 terrific phone and use it myself. Pretty excited for you joe. So here we go. Let's stupid on to question number three. Now this one is a toughie. How many youtube accounts does nice hat.

Speaker 7:          00:41:36       Now you may have seen in our previous episode of the Tuesday edition that shoe and ice left so many comments on our video. It was heights of and Sandy, I've not known on Youtube until now. So I asked you this, Joe. Is it a nine youtube accounts? Is it be 29 youtube accounts or is it see Joseph 50 Youtube accounts? Enter the mind of shoe and tell me what is your answer?

Speaker 5:          00:42:12       Go big or go home. See. Ooh,

Speaker 7:          00:42:15       wow. Well Joe, you are entering the mine of shoe and I like to see that you've, what you've dropped all rationale or reason. You have put your head in the shoe and Joe, I love it. Let's hear the answer. That is a lot to coordinate.

Speaker 4:          00:42:35       I don't remember the thing. That's hard.

Speaker 5:          00:42:38       You too. Youtube accounts. I think that gives you, but they have all history. They have subscribers, videos on them. They're really not goes to accounts. They all have his literary and interaction. I use them exactly how I got um, Capcom and on Ethan's video I'll post the comment and then switch to another county and it'll just list them. So well I'm doing is just taking switch accounts, another channel bouncing in, liking, commenting. But it sounds crazy, but yeah, that's all me.

Speaker 4:          00:43:10       It does sound crazy. Well, you're right about that and joe, you are right.

Speaker 5:          00:43:14       That's totally fucking bonkers.

Speaker 4:          00:43:16       The chant that much free time. The Youtube accounts study switches. Wow. She Nice. I'm telling you, this guy is a legend. I think he is going to be the first official member of the goof troop. The goof game. The goof game. What do we like? Goof troop or goof gang. Goof gang is more of an alliteration. Joe, what do you think? Yeah, do squad goon squad a partial to Gath gath pack. I mean, why can't it be all of those names? Well we've got a brand, you know, we've got a brand at appropriately. You got to leave it up to the people. Yeah. Oh Damn. Let's do a poll right now as we speak. We have the power, we've got twitter. So we've got goof gang, we've got goof troop, goof troop. That's kind of, I like goof troop and then what we'll do squat. You what had you suggested a a young Joseph.

Speaker 5:          00:44:12       Good squad. But now I'm like in years a little better. Well let's add it but it shouldn't, I couldn't pollute the full,

Speaker 4:          00:44:17       let's add it for the sake of historical preservation preserving Aaron's definitely. And uh, then I don't want to, did you have one you wanted to add? Anyone else? I said Gaf pack back or I'll throw it up there but the throw that poll up there, Dan and

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       keep us updated. Um, that's on our twitter by the way at h three podcasts if you guys want to participate.

And then he makes a channel called Schuh nice deleted videos. So erases it on one channel. We're, he uploads it on another and it's just, I don't, he's just on another level. So He's into asm. I don't know what sparked, do nice of all people again to Asmr. But he has this character, Marge Simpson Asm Mar. And this video was just from um, oh it's from the turn of the year. I said the end of 2017 but here is a little glimpse of shoe and ice. Marge Simpson, a smr, and this is completely sincere. This is not some kind of a bizarre, surreal humor.

So they brought me to the hospital. I'm a veteran, so my insurance is free. I didn't care. But I woke up with a tube down my throat. They're pumping my stomach and I was just like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Are you going to kill my buzz?

Speaker 4:          00:50:12       Well, Joe turns out it was one time and the doctors killed his bus instead of killing him. But uh, you, you were wrong. But that is fine, Joe, because you're doing great. You're on the board. It's two two. This is exciting. This is good for us.

And um, thank you so much for listening this galaxy phone plus. Thank you guys. Thank you so much. All right, talk to you. Thank you. So that was great. That was awesome. Um, now there is one bonus question left. Isla do you want to play? Yeah. Do you have the answer? Yeah. Well let's just play. Let's just play then. The second question is what's the first thing he ate on Youtube? So here you guys go.

Speaker 5:          00:53:15       My first dog was a roll of toilet paper. Single ply double apply or fog up the system.

Speaker 4:          00:53:22       Yeah. So we finally found someone that likes single ply

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       toilet paper. So that's why they make it just for shooting ice. Well guys, that was another successful edition of know your meme. Congratulations to Gel and is getting Samsung Galaxy s nine plus. Yeah. Um, what else we got to talk about, man? I mean that's, I don't mean, I mean that's the best shit. Now we have a lot more to talk about. Um, let's see what's next? Logan. Paul. These fucking guys. Okay. Logan Paul Verse Ksi, the promoters, whoever's involved in this shit is such dicks. Now we talked about this and we made a highlight of it, which was like 20 minutes long and

Speaker 8:          00:54:08       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       I barely, she, I didn't even show footage because I knew that they are going to be dicks about it. Yeah. We don't even show him show. It was one, two is compilation of Jake Paul getting punched in the face. And that was like, what's your, by the way, has intrinsic artistic value that that is the legal language be real. So for them to fucking block at worldwide, you stupid ass holes. And here's the best part. I disputed. I'm like, hey fuck boys. Hey, Hey idiots, eh, you know, release the claim

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       and they can keep it down for 30 days. Youtube gives them 30 days to just sit on that and keep it down. Like the video should go up. If I just viewed it, the video should go back up. I mean that's just, it's, it's crazy. And they're such assholes too, by the way. Ksi video is just down for 30 days. Remove. Yeah. And then at 30 days then he'd be like, Oh, you're right. Sorry. It's back up and nobody wants to watch it anymore. Yeah. But like, you know, Ksi and Logan Paul, okay. Sorry. Specifically is a guy that reacts to videos all the time on it. Yeah. No, I mean this is honestly just sad. And I know this has been happening to a lot of people and it's just, it's, and you know, you know what really pisses me off about it is like before the fight, they feed on everybody's publicity and everybody's talking about and before the fight fair use.

Speaker 1:          00:55:40       Oh Great. Yeah. Talk about it all you want after the fight. Talk for 22 minutes and don't even fucking show the footage. And we're going to block a worldwide. I swear to God there's a case for like a class action lawsuit because it's so abusive. I mean they haven't, no, no exploited. They have no right to remove it. It's just, that's what I said. I said don't. I said you have absolutely no right to block. That's just how the tools work so they can, well, I think youtube needs to modify the systems that you dispute it. Okay. Now the videos back up and now if you want to strike my video, if you want to put your money where your mouth is and make a legal claim, then go right ahead.

Speaker 6:          00:56:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:27       It's so frustrating, man. And for me it's not, it's not that big of a deal because it's just one highlight of a lot. But like, yeah, I mean it had 300,000 views and like half a day, but if that's your main content and they can just stomp on you like that, it's just fucked up. I Dunno man. Not Happy about that. That really pissed me off and they're intentionally just sit it going to sit on it for 30 days because they want people to go buy the paper view. That's so stupid and it doesn't really make sense. No one is going to watch our highlight instead of that. Well there was no capitation. Exactly. If anything is going to make people want to go watch. Yeah. That's the whole thing. And that I've never understood about most copyright copyright issues where it's like almost every time except for pure re upload yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:16       Is going to result in more traffic into your original product. It's just so pathetic. So I want Ksi and Logan Paul both to know and I'm sure both of them will easily be like, uh Oh, that's just a, that's just our production company. You know, if they do, first of all bullshit. I'm not letting you get a pass on that. Look at this shit. They, they make it under this like Shell, the shell company at t h piracy. There's no information, there's no accountability. It's just this, I mean this is Ksi and Logan, Paul and all these guys getting around having to take responsibility for doing something shitty that they know is wrong on youtube. A T h piracy. Give me a fucking break. The real crime is, look at that film now. So good. The world deserves that. I agree. I love that thumbnail. Good.

Speaker 1:          00:58:14       Dan, that was you, Dan. By the way, your copyright dispute is currently being reviewed by the copyright owner. You'll receive response within 30 days. How about three days? How about they have 24 hours and then the video goes back up and they can decide in 30 days. Why are you on the Dick of abusers? Youtube like it's time to do this differently. They have been improving though. Well, I think you had to have been less aggressive. Like we had this video on anything Daniella, where we react to this lady like dancing to hip hop and it was apparently attempted to be removed by Youtube, said no. So they'll send you an email saying this was, there was an attempt about, we said, no, actually I have to give huge credit to that department. That used to never happen that, that's actually happened several times where we got an email being like, and the best part is they say who tried to take it down.

Speaker 1:          00:59:11       It's for some reason when someone tries to take it down and they rejected, I see their email, their phone number, their name, the channel. I get their social security number basically. No, and they're like, this idiot at this address tried to remove your video and we gave him the middle finger. But somehow when these assholes do it, it's a total fucking shot in the dark. You know it's not, it's just, I honestly want to blame these guys because they know what they're doing and whoever put this together, no day there. You tubers, Dane know how it works. They're willfully abusing the systems that youtube has put in place that generally work pretty well most of the time and it's just, it's so late. Especially Ksi because he does react to videos. He relies on other people's content.

Speaker 8:          00:59:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       the Paul brothers, you can't expect anything from them ever. Nope.

Speaker 10:         01:00:03       You guys know the law better than most because of the lawsuit that you went through and everything. The whole 30 day thing, is that youtube policy or is that the, is that the actual legal law, like the DMC a thing? Oh, that's just youtube.

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       Yeah. I'm, I'm 99% sure. That's just completely unrelated to the law week. I mean youtube put their policies in place originally. Basically they were faced with a huge decision when they were in their infancy and people were pirating content all the time and putting it on youtube. And so they had an existential crisis where they needed to deal with this issue or get sued into oblivion and not be a legitimate platform.

Speaker 10:         01:00:45       Yeah. And so they are very legitimate and they do have a pretty good suicide. I'm like, if you compare it to facebook, there was no system at all. Yeah. So Youtube is pretty good. It's just, it's hard to deal with so many people and it was always going to be someone who will abuse it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:01       It is, I mean, this video in particular, it's just so frustrating because I didn't even show the footage. Yeah. We were just talking. I literally explicitly avoided showing the footage because I want it to avoid this. And now 30 days and I'm help, I can do nothing. It's just so f up. It's so whacked, Dude. It's seriously so wack. So you know, fuck these guys.

Speaker 8:          01:01:30       I Dunno.

Speaker 10:         01:01:33       Hey, speaking of whack, got a 3000 responses on this Paul already. Oh yeah. Give us the information. Well, I got to tell you, we are deadlocked at 33% each between two it goof troop, both 33% trailing a little behind his gaf pack at 27 and then port group squad. Nobody. Nobody's on board with goon squad. What are the, what are the top two again? Can you uh, day and goof troop. They are gang goof troop. I think. I personally think the goof game because of that generation. It's just going to say that I would put for that one goof gang. Let me vote right now. He has got to tip the scale. Okay, that's interesting though.

Speaker 1:          01:02:14       Anyway, Pewdie Pie. Here's another one. This one Pewdie Pie as everyone knows, has been the biggest subscribed channel on youtube for pretty much ever as far as I can and common history and what he's up to like 65 million subscribers now, but out of nowhere comes this channel t series. They're out like 60 million subscribers and their channel is going insane and I'm thinking, who, who are these guys? What is t series? And so that is what I'm here to answer for all you guys today. What is t series first, let's start by looking at their stats. Okay, let's pull up the social blades here for TV series. Now past 30 days, 2.1 and a half billion

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       views. Yeah, I saw that number and I, I was like, wait, there's too many numbers. They call us too many digits. Uh, in the past 30 days they've had 4.3 million subscribers, a plus bus. The grade 4.3 million in the last 30 days. Their parents would be proud. I mean, compare that with Cutie Pie. Let's see. Damn, like Cutie Pie has 150 million views. So it's a lot. He's about, uh, I mean, what did, what did they have like 3 billion and not a comma and he's under a million. So they're on a, on subs per month, which of course is nothing to scoff at, but they are on track quickly. The past young Felix here and so fun ended. There's a grade, there's a lot of double plus a plus. Oh yeah, they're breaking the metrics here. So 2.1 billion views, that is just madness. So, okay, who the hell are they and why are they getting so many fricking subscribers and views t series? Well, the answer should

Speaker 8:          01:04:16       hm

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       not surprise you. I don't know what these big challenges are always so weird. It's just an, it's like Bollywood Shit. It's just a bunch of Bollywood Shit. And you know, I was looking at the population of India. These motherfuckers have like 1.4 billion people in India is there about the past China as the most populous country. So they are churning out youtube views and unprecedented numbers. If I was Indian I'd be crushing it, getting 10 million views a day. Um, so anyway, I curated some of their videos to show you guys what's going on with t series here. Let me show you first the channel. Yeah, it was, let's look at the channel.

Speaker 8:          01:05:06       No,

Speaker 1:          01:05:06       they upload a ungodly amount here. 10 hours, 600,000 views, nine hours, 20,000. So the variance is quite large. You know, one day, 100,000 views and then you go down a little bit and you can see. So the views are pretty paltry. But then here you see five days ago, 20 million views. Hmm, excuse me, I'm allergic to views. And so then you keep going through here and you see this little nuggets like, oh six days ago, 11 million views. Yeah know one week ago, 10 million views. So these guys are just shitting out so much bollywood that it's giving my wood Bali, I'm getting a Bali hard on right now looking at these numbers, right. How is it possible the channel like, like, cause if it's the, if the views vary so much, why do people subscribe? You know, usually those kind of channels of will not have subscribers because they just kind of like, the truth is you let, and you're, and you're right, it will be a viral video, but mostly not. You know, the truth is that is correct because if you look at the ratio, they have over 2 billion views a month and they're getting 3 million subscribers. I think puty pies viewed a subscriber ratio is way higher, but he's getting like 20 or 30 less views per month, you know? But there's the scope of uses and seeing, it's like everybody in India, I've got the hard lined in t series, so let's watch some of their greatest hits. It's curated India's finest Bollywood here for you guys. And let's see what these guys are up to shelly

Speaker 8:          01:06:58       and what do we got here?

Speaker 1:          01:07:02       Most popular video. Uh, whoa. Look at the view. Almost 600 million views. How old are they? Do they just, this is only a couple of months old are, well, several months old. Let's have a look.

Speaker 4:          01:07:14       Cause they're like, they're viga. Is it there? What? Vivo?

Speaker 1:          01:07:22       It's like Indian Vivo. That's right. Now this, this Bollywood is the cornea shit on the, on the history of the earth. I don't think anything has ever been produced corner than Bollywood. Here's a guy. Uh, he's texting while driving and he almost plows down, cut short. The lives of two sweet, innocent young girls. Do they react poorly and say, hey, I'm calling the police. Fuck you know, a seduction happens from this.

Speaker 4:          01:07:51       Of course. Okay. He's on his phone. It's not lenny almost murders and cold manslaughter. He saw it. He's like, Hey, what's up girl? I almost fucking killed you. Huh? So anyway, Yada, Yada Yada.

Speaker 1:          01:08:09       Hollywood guys, by the way, to or like the corniest mother dude in here anyway. Fuck at the end of the day, you know how it goes. Um, thought that was interesting. We've got more to come. This was one of their most recent uploads, which was quite violent if I can say that. Um, see this is they're low viewed ones. This one has 26,000 views and it was just uploaded today actually incidentally today, I'm only four hours ago actually. So who knows? It could be their next big hit. It's very violent and um, quite shocking to be frank.

Speaker 1:          01:08:58       Not Noticing Bollywood action movies that these Bollywood Stars somehow always looked like janitors or something like this is the cause of action star. And I guess their, their idea of masculinity is just, it's very different from our own, it's interesting. A lot of Kung Fu movies, the guys aren't necessarily like handsome leading man. Either they look back and this guy doesn't look bad at, at least in my opinion. But Hey, in India he might be king fucking dog. Uh, I really don't know what's happening. So an execution, there's really not much preload to this either. Just lots of execution and bullet time. And now this janitor is about to kick ass

Speaker 6:          01:09:50       Jesus.

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       I see what you mean. She's gotten like a bad vibe. I mean he like even if you put them in a gooey and made them look as bad as possible, he would still just look like, you know the kiosk, the guy, the Kiehl's. So he grabbed it as a regular guy. Dick slammed him. We've had the, the, that hat, what kind of name that died. Here are now daddy. Wait. But at that hero and my opinion needs like there needs to be something that back up the fact that he can kill 20 guys with his bare hands because the Pudgy guy at the kiosk, I'm not necessarily believe in it. She's got a big heart. He's got a big heart and he sliced to do it in half and suddenly and a hand right off, man, this is violent. So there you go. And I don't know what I mean, this is just nonsense. It's crime. Sorry. Beauty. Fine. So this is actually really violent. I'm not going to show it, but he just executes that guy. Well I really don't know what I just watched the essence of Bollywood. Yeah. Always because maybe those are clips from a movie and they like turn it into a, you know, an action set piece thing for youtube can it's bollywood year.

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       Overthink things. Not a bollywood. I got a sack and uh, that's some good stuff.

Speaker 8:          01:11:19       All right.

Speaker 4:          01:11:22       No, I listen. Well you got another video. I am not trying to slam bollywood. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:27       Make 'em I'm goofing around, you know, let me step back a minute. It's just the Indian sense of culture and entertainment and masculinity and femininity and all these things are so different. It's just an interesting thing to be hold and art. All Indians, the goofiest people you've ever met in your life. No, I'm kidding. That was a joke. I was stepping back and then plowing forward. Isla thought about it. She's like,

Speaker 4:          01:11:51       cause I was like, Hey, no, I was going to say they are actually very nice. The ones that I knew goofy though.

Speaker 8:          01:11:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:59       Maybe I'm kidding about it. I don't actually think that, come on. This is the history, podcasts, opinion zone, right? You entered, everyone enters. Not everyone leaves a what else we got here? I guess that's about it. You get the idea. Here's another one. This one is 210 million views in less than one month. There you go. They just, they have so many hits. I mean that here you go. More Dad's beating each other up.

Speaker 4:          01:12:32       [inaudible] this is a real one of these. We joking about it before the shell. What is it with all exotic like non European cultures. They all do. What's this? They do it in Israel. Isla you've fucking got a crazy one. DNA and Israel and Middle East. Even in Greece they do this and uh, Lebanon, he, Ron and now I'm seeing even in India we're doing this. Why can't white people get on this? You just can't pull it off. Like everyone in the world's doing this. You know what I mean? Ethan, you're such a, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:13:20       you're what? What's the criticism of me right now?

Speaker 4:          01:13:24       I Dunno. Such a bigot. They get no criticism. There's one opinion here and it's correct. Begging Ethan. So closed minded. Ethan is so disrespectful of other people's cultures.

Speaker 8:          01:13:40       Yeah. Well

Speaker 1:          01:13:42       give me one of these. Give me one of these in fucking, you know, go subscribe to two series veer. So multicultural. Why you go subscribe to t series with notifications on already did. Anyway, I thought it was interesting if you guys are glued to the TV about this rivalry. There is of course a live counter up to five earth years t series, live stream, live updates with music and everything you need to be entertained. Let's take a look at the numbers. Wow. We've got pewdie pie in the rise t series is catching up quick. Oh I give them like a day. Yeah, they're, they're going to creep up really fast. So that's out there. If you really have nothing better to do with you.

Speaker 4:          01:14:27       Ah, what else?

Speaker 11:         01:14:30       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:14:33       Hit poll came out with a new video. That is truly something I couldn't believe Israel. This is why I showed up to work today. We've talked about pit bull here on the podcast with Jack and Eric and man, this new one, I couldn't believe. I can't believe what I'm seeing is this frog. Like I see the frog here. So I guess it's a reoccurring meme. You see this healer? This says 800 million views. Oh, they want to got missing something. Let me watch this. This says 800 million views. She has a dancing frog. It's so weird. What the fuck? Look at it.

Speaker 4:          01:15:10       800 million views. That's almost a billion views. That is not related to this song. So yeah guys, this is 800 million views. El Chapo ultra music. Could you do this possibly to this music or the Latins on this? I don't think so. They're more salsa. It's like a mixed with then submitted through any, this frog is on a ease on Mars cause I ain't ever damn, this shit is so weird. The 800 million people watch this. Who made this and why it's good shit. This quality content.

Speaker 1:          01:15:54       Oh, why is the whole world so weird? Like, okay, Latin America now it's on my goofy list. I wonder what is it in America that white people do that everyone else, like those motherfuckers are weird apparently. Shit without a buddy day based off of the responses we've gotten. Really? Yeah. I mean all the emails that I've been seeing, people wipe their ass, hold their hand. I think that's probably not totally

Speaker 1:          01:16:22       Ian. Look, there's someone to look that up because I don't want to be that ignorant to get that wrong. Well maybe some, I mean there's 1.3 billion people in India, you know? Hmm. Um, well yeah, I know there was something that we're all fat probably. They're like, well, you're all fat and you don't talk about that all the time. It's, yeah, that's pretty, that's a big one. That's kind of big. Morbidly obese is pretty wild and it's just like being overly polite maybe. But is that the same thing as 800 million people watching a dancing frog? I'm not sure that's on the logo. Like, here's this video.

Speaker 11:         01:17:10       Get my needles,

Speaker 4:          01:17:14       your boy dancing frog tape on. Got The funniest face I've ever seen in my life. Dude. He just fucking the frog. Just strip naked. Hell you guys. It looks like the girls want to fuck the frog. If I'm being honest, there's, there's not really irony here. Like they're serious about this frog. Do you think flux better to the frog or a pit bull? I think they think it's funny and think so. They're not like that. Frog is bad ass.

Speaker 1:          01:17:58       Thanks. So Isla, who would you rather fuck? Pit Bull or the frog. I gotta go with the fraud. I'm going to have pit bull feels about that. Although you're not alone. All those girls seem to want to fuck frog. I'm being frank with you. He's got crazy hip thrusts that frog. He can really shake it.

Speaker 4:          01:18:24       It looks like

Speaker 1:          01:18:25       salad fingers. I mean it's just not human. It's just not right now. No

Speaker 4:          01:18:33       frog. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       Close your eyes and don't say a word. All right. I'm seeing enough of that frog. Whoa. I really wonder what white people do that words the rest of the world out.

Speaker 8:          01:19:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:19:00       Um, what else? We got this one. It kind of feel like I'm being so ignorant this episode, but I got a plow on it. Doesn't get better from here guys. We're ending the meaning of it down. It took a seat. What does it mean? Maybe you should read this. Where, where is it located? Where are you reading it? And it is located on the Google. I do help me out and I on all right.

Speaker 1:          01:19:30       Dom, add to Casita means, um, casino, right? Sita. It means, and it's got a picture of the frog den. So I know I'm right. It means, um, stay still and be quiet. And this will all be over soon. No, it kind of means give me your little thing. Whoa. That's even weirder than what I said though. The literal translation of the word Caseta is an innocent enough. It means little thing. The course of this duty is dripping with sexual innuendo and Latin America. Dom a Tuco Sita means give me your reproductive part. Whoa. This frog is Grazie don to Casita. Holy Shit.

Speaker 1:          01:20:19       Give me your little part. Oh, sorry. Doesn't really translate. That's what they're saying. They're saying in Latin America that means give me a reproductive, I think with like the implication, I think it makes like give it, give it, give it to me babe. Yeah. Yeah. I think that frog has got more planned than, you know, done. Um, okay. Let's move it on. You guys know about this test holiday. She's a plus model. Now I want to handle this story as tactfully and our fleet as I can't because I feel like I have something I, a legitimate thing that I want to express about this. Okay. I don't know what that was and I don't want him to be, you know, I want to handle this, uh, you know, politically here. Okay. Now we've got tess holiday and she's featured on the cover of cosmopolitan. She's a plus size model. Plainly, you can see that it's extremely plain to see [inaudible]. And, um,

Speaker 1:          01:21:20       and so this whole thing about like, you know, they're trying to normalize and say like, Hey, you don't have to be and shape or supermodel right to be on the cover of cosmopolitan or to be an object of beauty and admiration. Right. It's like a healthy at every size kind of thing. Yeah. And, and when I saw this, I was like, you know, if you're going to criticize magazines for putting anorexic girls on the cover, which promotes an unhealthy lifestyle, I don't see that this is any different. When you put a morbidly obese person on a magazine and glorify it, that's just as unhealthy as anorexia. I mean, I'm not, I'm not saying she's not beautiful or that someone would not be attracted to her, but like I don't understand this argument of saying somebody is fit and attractive and work super hard on their health and their fitness.

Speaker 1:          01:22:23       By the way, I have so much respect for people that actually maintain their physical body because rich or poor or wherever you are, you have to put in the work. There's no shortcuts. There's no work around whoever you are from the king to the peasant. And if you want that body, it takes raw work and dedication. Now this does not require that there's no, there's nothing in my mind, commendable. There's nothing and my, and I'm not, and I'm not saying fuck her because she's fat. That's not my point is, but that we look at someone who is physically fit, that they have achieved something and that's why we admire them and we put them on magazines because everybody has the potential within them to carve their body out of marble, so to speak. You know, to chisel away through hard work, that perfect body. But this, there's no, there's nothing admirable. I mean there's, there's no, uh, achievement. There's no

Speaker 10:         01:23:30       hard work and sacrifice and it's just the conversation took a weird turn. I can, instead of saying you don't, you can feel eh, confident, you know, you can, you don't have to feel horrible about yourself. Yeah. And be apply size, but you don't need to glorify it. I find it bizarre.

Speaker 1:          01:23:52       I find it frankly bizarre to glorify. I mean, a more morbid illness. I mean, we sat here and talked with Boogie who was morbidly obese. I mean the guy is not, there's nothing good about being morbidly obese. And if you feel good and happy with yourself, God bless. But like these are the same people. They're saying, oh, these anorexic models are not realistic. Yeah. They're not realistic. They're models. It takes a lot of hard work. The look that good physically to get a six pack and have a fucking crazy ass and thighs and be like fit beautiful person. Right? Yeah. It's not realistic. It's really hard to do that.

Speaker 12:         01:24:41       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:24:42       So, um, I think this is weird. I think it's weird. I don't get it. And by the way, also I just want to point out to, people always talk about like photoshop and like, oh, that's not realistic. It's photoshop. She is photoshops all the way those thighs and her chest and her arms and everything. Her face is so photoshop. Then I have to tell you my hunch is that that unedited video, that unedited photo, you would look at it and be like, that lady's sick. Not Disgusting. But I mean like you see what Morbid obesity looks like. They've paint brushed it and brushed it and made it look beautiful and attractive and hey she's got soft skin and she looks good and she's got tattoos and shit. She has a little miss piggy on her form. Incidentally. I didn't say that. I mean it's right there Mr [inaudible].

Speaker 10:         01:25:38       It's on her forearm. The treatment of the photo is the same as the ones they're criticizing anyone cause she's still got makeup. She's exactly, it was photoshop. You can see exactly the shading and everything is on. It must have been touched, you know, in Photoshop.

Speaker 1:          01:25:54       And by the way, I've met a lot of morbidly obese people. I'm a fat guy and obviously to that level. But boogie was saying like think morbidly obese. It's a, it is like an illness as I understand it, but like there's nothing happy about that. [inaudible] I dunno. I Dunno. I don't, I just don't, I don't get it. I think as dangerous. I think we as a society need to stop being like, I guess I just don't know what's the point. I mean like I wear over the point where we're like, you're fat and shame on you and whatever, but like to put someone up who's sick and say look there, to glorify it in the same way, it just seems hypocritical. Yeah. This was a tough one to talk about. Their hailing her as a brave. I mean, what's brave about, you know, eating ice cream?

Speaker 1:          01:26:51       Did I go too far? I don't know. Can I get one of these? Uh, was waiting for a joke? Yeah, I said nothing. You know what does bother me though is on the other hand, let's get our shit straight. Okay. Like we've got this shit on, but the re I think the real damaging shit that's going in magazines right now is these Kim Kardashians. Okay. With fake asses, perform through dangerous procedures. See that is unobtainable. So then you've got these glow, these poor girls who are working their ass off to try to obtain an ass like Kim Kardashians, which is actually literally impossible. Now that is an unrealistic goal to set. I mean here, let me, let me show you these Kim Kardashians. Before and after these, these, these Kardashians are fucking twisted. It, they've had so much surgery, like there's nothing left of like who they used to be and it is. So I feel like it's so damaging for actually for young women who are comparing themselves. Look at this. This is going to fucking crack you up.

Speaker 6:          01:28:13       Look at this.

Speaker 1:          01:28:16       Look at that ass before and after. Yeah. It's like she just excuse, you've got to like whoopee cushions in r and so I gave him the picture on the right is not updated anymore. It's gotten bigger, progressively bigger. I Dunno, her ass has gotten so fricking big. Look at this one. I mean, get the hell Outta here with this. Which one do you want to say? Um, just there's like a dress there in the middle. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:28:56       Anyway, that's all of them have these like bodies that were created laboratories. I mean, if you want to talk about some of these unhealthy, that's what's up now actually, I have a story here about, and it's really sad. Um, what are we going to say? You do something bad? No, this lady went to get a bum lift as they call it, a mother of three. It was told by her partner, she did not need surgery, but obsessed with these images of Kim Kardashians. All these woman with fake acid, which is one of the strangest phenomenon is I would say maybe that's what Indian people think is weird about white people and we'll get an ass surgeries.

Speaker 10:         01:29:32       No, everyone's doing it now.

Speaker 1:          01:29:34       Thanks. So [inaudible] um, and it's not only white, but get a load of this. Uh, Leah Cambridge, a 29 year old beautician from Leeds in England is said to have died this week after she underwent the increasingly popular cosmetic surgery at a clinic. Was it in Turkey or somewhere? Yeah, the guy was apparently a world renowned surgeon. And what they do is they take the fat from your other parts of your body. Yeah. And they inject it into your ass. But the catch is that it's actually extremely dangerous because what happened in this case is that he injected the fat into one of her main arteries that went through her ass, and it went to our heart and our brain and she had a fucking stroke.

Speaker 8:          01:30:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30:19       Yeah. So how about that for ridiculous, you know what I mean? Like, I dunno. I feel like we should be talking about this mental illness that's in our society. People are putting fat in their ass.

Speaker 8:          01:30:33       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:30:33       Um, crazy shit. Good. Yeah. Even Cardi B has a story about how she did and in like a surgery at any illegal place just in some lady's basement. I mean, that's probably, people can't afford to go to probably the legitimate places,

Speaker 1:          01:30:52       the procedure costs. Um, oh, she, she definitely want cheap.

Speaker 8:          01:30:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:31:00       The procedure costs 6,500 pounds to 10,000 pounds in the UK, but in the Turkey it costs 3000 pounds. Well, I didn't, I was probably expensive and Turkey, but like, man, God, that's so tragic. Like Jesus Christ. I think we need to be talking about that.

Speaker 10:         01:31:18       I think guys who talk more to their girlfriends and tell them they really don't need to do it well, because I feel like it becomes like a competition. But when women and they start to feel insecure next to that, the article said the guy told her she didn't get it. Like, well what could he do? Yeah. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:31:37       I don't know. It's so bad I think.

Speaker 10:         01:31:39       But it's like you open instagram and all you see is like this crazy but like

Speaker 1:          01:31:46       unrealistic actually unreal sick bodies. We used to consider unrealistic bodies in this dialogue of like super fit, hardworking people that achieved a god like body. Yeah. Now we're talking about people that are injecting fat in their ass and then little girls have being like, how do I get that ass? Oh, I'm gonna go get fat injected in my heart and have a stroke. Well, yeah, it's really easy. It's really easy to feel insecure when you see all those acids. [inaudible] Graham is very dangerous. I'm, I'm very, I'm skinny and like Brady flat all around. And it's like when you look at those, all the instagram models these days, it's crazy. It's like, do you feel bad when you see that stuff? I'm pretty at peace with my body so I don't, but I can see, I can point in your life when you were, yeah, there was when I was younger, but I think I've, I've talked to our friends.

Speaker 1:          01:32:45       Perfect. Just leave. But I know and you're asked to flop. You're asked is great. Everything's going on there. It's a very regular too skinny person. The dips, a great one. One of the best. But like, yeah, I've talked to, I do have friends and I know people feel pretty insecure and a lot of people are doing the surgeries and a lot, let's talk about not reach people to ethical morning. Let's talk about that. Yeah. I don't know this whole thing about like, I feel like, and it's the same in Israel, so that's why I'm saying it's not, I don't think it's only here. So that was a whole discussion about body issues. So I hope that there was something there. Interesting for you. And if you're considering I'm injecting fat into your ass, don't do it. Please. I frankly, I on my part, when I see Kim Kardashians ass, I'm like, you have a disease. It looks like you have a tumor in your ass. It just becomes like a, almost like a carrie could. Sure. It's looks, it looks like, I mean to me it looks really bad.

Speaker 1:          01:34:01       How did she, when she shits it must be like a long way to the toilet. It was that got a lot of space between the ass you cause it's so big she must have to like either she's spreads open the ass cheeks super wide or she's getting shit streaks on the inside of her cheek and did not think about that. Think about it. Also these days you have to have like a 10 inch Dick just to get inside of her. Wouldn't you love to discuss with her her wiping? You've got Kim condition on the line? Yeah. I'm not sure that's a conversation she's uh, she's ready to have. No.

Speaker 1:          01:34:38       But seriously, like how do you even have sex with a girl that fat? Like the barrier for entry is like eight matrix plus it works like that. I think the fat goes like sideways and more all up to the side. I mean that doesn't sound sexy ladies. Keep your ass natural. Keep it all natural. Okay. You're looking good, you're beautiful. And I guarantee you there's Min, every, everywhere, every corner you turn that wants to fuck you. It just the way you are. And most of them don't even have a tech big enough to penetrate the ass on Kim Kardashians. Right. You'll okay. All right. What else? We got not pep talk. Louis C. Case back. Woo.

Speaker 1:          01:35:25       I feel like I don't want to talk about this. Not because I, I'll talk about briefly just in Somas there's so much here, but we see case back. Um, he just popped in apparently. You know, it was funny cause we were talking with Bert like, yeah, before this happened and we were like, um, Louie, he was going to be back at his opening line is going to be like some genius line. Yeah. And everyone's gonna be like, oh, he's a genius. And he's back and we said like, we don't know how long it's gonna take. And like maybe two years, couple of years, and then the next day. You know what I got to say? A lot of people were upset that he had the balls to come back and that he hadn't been punished and that, you know, Fuck Louis C K, that's not my angle. I think he came back too soon.

Speaker 1:          01:36:18       What I what I'm disappointed in as him as a comedian, you can't just come back on stage and do material like a, nothing happened. He didn't even address it. Like I did hear the material was funny. Wow. Yeah. I'm sure he is very funny. Yeah. But it's like, dude, you had the moment. The moment had to be perfect. Yeah. He had to come out after a couple of years and when people almost forgot it and be like, so how about them dog years? Huh? Or whatever. I know. So it was way too soon. Just people need enough time to like, yeah, it was too thin. They just the news. But then someone had a good point. Was it? I don't remember who brought it up. Was it Dan? Uh, can someone take shredder out? He's got your hurt. Treader it's his birthday and all. He's such a cutie pie cook them a flaming neon. Okay. We said it was shredded birthday at the top, right? Yeah. We're going to cook them a Philemon Yellen tonight. I'm most excited for me to eat a flaming on. Um,

Speaker 10:         01:37:26       I just think, oh, I forget who said this, but they're like, he's probably so depressed and borderline, even suicidal. I don't know if that's true or not, but like, yeah, that, that was me saying that and yeah. And you know, it makes me wonder a lot of these comedians that you guys have even talked to you on the show. Just talk about how like therapeutic even for you, Ethan, you know, when you come and do the podcast and everything and you know, Louie, his life, his stand up. So yeah. Makes me wonder. It's like I, I agree that I think it's way too soon for him to come back, but I almost wonder if he was just sitting at home alone and like, I gotta get out there and do this, or I don't know what I'm going to do, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:38:07       Yeah. I don't know. His situation is a tough one. It was just mostly weird to just not even acknowledge. Yeah, that's what I, that's what I'm disappointed because I don't know, there was so much pressure on that opening line of like, Oh shit, Louise back. I feel like he should have waited until everyone almost forgot it. Even that me too was a thing like it was settled. You're like, okay, you too. You too. And then wait another year and then Louie, his opening line would be something like that.

Speaker 11:         01:38:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:38:40       Anyone want to see my deck right close to the north. Anyone in here want to see me masturbate. Right. You own it to Saint Louis. That would have been a great opening line. What did not have got out there and just whipped it out. Yeah. Don't even, he goes like this, lock the doors and then he takes his dick out. That would have killed. So anyway, that's my 2 cents on that. Guys. This is the correct opinion zone. You wash these Tuesday episodes for my opinion, which are correct and relevant. Every top, if you disagree, keep watching. I don't want to lose you as a viewer, but just know that you are wrong. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:39:27       the celeb hacker who hacked a Jennifer Lawrence and all the celebrities who got all their nudies leaked out into the world, the fat burning as it were, has pleaded guilty. Admitting that, and here's what shocked me about this story. He sent emails to the victims while posing as members of onlines, apple's online security personnel in order to obtain their username and passwords. This, this amazing hacker that got all these nudes. He was just doing a phishing scam. It's all it takes. I thought this was some like slick underground, crazy hacker. Yeah. He's just a guy who sent the email to Jennifer Lawrence and said, hey, please log into your apple account. I almost feel like that is what happen is like 90% of the time. Yeah. Like how often did they actually have your password? Oh I thought it was some crazy thing cause he, he had like dozens of of celebrity nudes and

Speaker 1:          01:40:31       you know, it was just a fricking phishing scam. So there you go. Get inspired you guys. I think this is an inspiring twist on this story to everyone out there who's like, I want to see Jennifer Lawrence nude. But I mean, I'll know, you know I'm saying like, I'm not saying that specifically, but like anything is possible. Sometimes you will go to jail. Yeah, you will go to jail. Obviously there's consequences, but that's not the more, the moral, the story is not to steal people's nudes, but that anything is possible. Did you think that you could see Jennifer Lawrence nude by simply sending her a login credentials and saying, Hey, I'm from apple. Can you log in now? I'm not saying to do that, but I'm just saying get inspired because this guy had a simple idea that he took all the way to prison and I'm saying it, it's inspiring in a weird twist away. You should never had done that. Shame on him. You know, privacy matters. Uh, they should, they should have never come out and I should have never looked at them. But that being said, get inspired. I think if you look into getting inspired, you should subscribe to tc or is plugging into theory. They need all the help. They can get bumped. Everything.

Speaker 1:          01:41:45       I'm not enough subscribers. I feel awful for those slip that that was a huge violence. I want to make clear that I was a huge violation and, and uh, a real, a real wacky shame, you know? But Hey, there's something inspiring there though. You have to admit, nope. Just a little piece of shit that was going to, you know what? You know what he did? It's like that movie, the pursuit of happiness with will smith where he had like the Rubik's cube and that got him the job. It's like the simple plan, get you all the way and that's what's inspiring and went on and to follow along. Okay, let's move on. Thank you. Move waiting for that. Uh, up next. God, this is going on and on. We have a lot more here. Good. Kind of exhausted. I wonder if we should move some of this over. We could skip. We've got Ariana groped. We've got, uh, Michael Coen starts to go fuck me and that. We're going to go to that one. Hmm. Love that story. Well, they're already under groped is pretty amazing too. All right, let's just finish it up. Arriana groped. So, oh man. Ariana Grande Day is at the funeral of a wreath, the Franklin and this slimy, slimy dude, man.

Speaker 1:          01:43:17       Gropes her alive during a funeral. It's crazy shit ever. It reminds me of this clip. We watched him w Lou Walsh grabbing that girl's ass on TV. It's like they have a secret society where they're like, I'm going to, they're like, hey, they like push the boundary with each other. You know what I mean? I'm going to grow up a famous person and what are they going to say? It's not even about the famous person there. They're not there anymore because it's, yeah, but there's a sick mind. It's like they're daring each other to get away with the

Speaker 8:          01:43:52       stunt.

Speaker 1:          01:43:54       Oh yeah. But I'm sure he did. I don't look at it like that. I just think it's, it's just like what is going on in your head? So here it is anyway,

Speaker 13:         01:44:05       because

Speaker 10:         01:44:07       I have to brush up my pants under her. But when I saw out the on the program, I thought that this is a new something at Taco Bell.

Speaker 1:          01:44:21       Meanwhile, saying that he thought she was a Taco Bell Item, Aka a snack,

Speaker 8:          01:44:27       and

Speaker 1:          01:44:29       the most thing that he's doing with his hand is something stolen. Unnatural. Enjoy this icon here. Yeah, he's like digging in here. I've got a gift so you can look at more closely. But I like how he's saying on one hand I grow. I got to give you all your restraint. Now give me that titty. Oh goodness. Look how he's like, he's like really grabbing, I mean that's intentional. As it gets. Right. I mean, there's no way to explain it any other way, right? No, it's like this and he's like digging in, you know? Yeah. That's so creepy.

Speaker 8:          01:45:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:45:15       good to see these men of God lately are not winning. The hearts and minds are not winning my heart and mind. I guess that's all there is to that one. Yeah. He apologize. Whatever. Um,

Speaker 10:         01:45:33       oh, can you just get away with an apology though? Well, the church just like want to get rid of that guy immediately. Well, here's what I don't understand.

Speaker 1:          01:45:39       It was really half assed too. Maybe you can find it. I thought I had it here. Can you guys find it? Sure. He's just like, you know, uh, I guess maybe I pushed it. I was hugging everyone anyway. I apologize. It was basically just that

Speaker 10:         01:45:53       said, it would never be my intention to touch any woman's breasts. I don't know. I guess I put my arm around her. Maybe I crossed the border. Maybe I was too friendly or familiar. But again, I apologize. Here we've got a video of it.

Speaker 8:          01:46:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:07       Bishop Ellis. By the way, let's just say his name for the record.

Speaker 13:         01:46:11       I apologize because

Speaker 10:         01:46:16       I have to brush up. My 20 year old daughter tells me, dad, you are old and 16

Speaker 14:         01:46:23       fan

Speaker 1:          01:46:25       girl. Did they give you all your respect?

Speaker 14:         01:46:30       I certainly want to apologize to Ariana and to her fans and to our family and to entire community. If what I say said was taken on the wrong way, and Alyssa,

Speaker 1:          01:46:42       oh, he's talking about the Taco bell comment to the tick groping, yet he's got a lot to answer for.

Speaker 14:         01:46:49       Maybe it's just

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       a joke that went bad, but when you're doing the program for nine hours, you know and tried to keep it lively, you're trying to make some funny references and what have you. I love everybody. Everybody that knows the visibility and greater reason than those that we love everybody and listen, it's not about whether I meant or didn't mean it, but whether somebody took it the wrong way, I'm the one that said it and if it was taken up to be an offensive statement, I apologize. That's the easiest thing for me to do, the right thing for me to do. And I certainly hope that she would forgive me. And the last thing you want to do is to be a distraction. Didn't address the Franklin meaning of soul. This is all about her. It's not about me. And I'm so sorry if I inserted myself in a way that took away from this.

Speaker 1:          01:47:35       So I apologize Ariana and to her community, he never addressed the tick grab. He addressed the top of Bell Rondae. Uh, comment.
