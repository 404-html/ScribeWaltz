Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Five four, three, two. Welcome to the age three podcasts extravaganza. That's right. We're an extravaganza now. Thank you to 23 and me, postmates and hymns for sponsoring us and thank you to everybody for joining us today on this beautiful blessing frat boy. Do I love Fridays. We started taking the weekends off and I just get cut it on Fridays now. Happy Friday to everyone watching. We've got a lot to discuss today. We're very excited. We've got some Shane up dates, we've got some Papa John Updates. We've got uh, some bouffy updates. We've talked previously about a Gugu for goofus slap, slap, boop, boop, a slap. And Ian, the intern has prepared for us one of his notorious much celebrated powerpoint presentation on Dis ciphering, the meaning of Kanye West. Wow. That's a big task. But I know it was up for it. But before we get into all of that, I've got a little announcement. Not really an announcement, just something I wanted to talk about. But it may be that Ila is, is there's a new thing of the thickening. It was going to be thickening up here soon. What does that mean? What I'm trying to say is that Isla won't be drinking alcohol if she's responsible. What I'm trying to say? Read podcasts. Extravagant. That's me. Sorry. Oh Jeez.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       How long was that going? Oh, it just start like just now. You turned it off immediately and flashback like, no, he lives, there's two stripes. She's cooking something up. Anyone? It's a cinnamon roll with rostain man Ula. It's weird. Just Bro. He loves, uh, there's something going on. So we did it. Well it's, we, we don't know yet if anything's gonna go wrong. She's pregnant.

Speaker 2:          00:02:30       You look pregnant. I have been, I've been wording

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       and Isla for a year. I mean, I'm just going frankly, like a, we've been to, I've been, I've been, you know what I'm saying? It's been on, we've talked about it a lot on the podcast. So it's a natural extension of our core, of our efforts to get Ila knocked up. And I have been a fully unchaste about two years. Dick has been out

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       and wording. We did the test, we did everything. But I'll say that we got, it happened naturally and just the good old fashioned way you had sex grubs. Yeah, I know. I know it is gross. I Dunno. I don't know. I don't know how to feel about it. Well, just like two days ago, two days ago we found out and Ila, she will admit was a couple days late on her period and her boobs, Eh, were Ra. How would you say tender? What your boobs were tender. It just hurts. I don't know yet. Some tender as pity.

Speaker 3:          00:03:43       But anyway, that's like what happens when you're getting the period and I remember it was like a week earlier like, oh, I'm getting my period not happening. And I was like, what is going on? And the night before I was like, maybe you're pregnant jokingly. Yeah. And I was like, actually I already checked on it was negative, but it wasn't your first idea of the Morgan do it. Right? Yeah. But it's interesting because the last two months we kind of doing really try, we're like, fuck this shit, whatever. If it happens, it happens and we're just not going to pay attention. Of course. That's when it happened. So funny. Yeah, of course. And I don't know how to feel about it. I'm scared. I don't know how to feel about it. It's terrifying. I'm more scared than you because you got to shit it. I I'm not, I have utmost respect for that.

Speaker 3:          00:04:35       I'm telling you that the, and people always say like don't tell until, I dunno. I mean Israel even four months, I don't know. It's like, but then you're going to see that I'm pregnant. Like it was just superstitious, you know, or, but you had a really good point about maybe something will go wrong, but it's like if that happens then what? I'm not supposed to talk about it. Like it's a secret like, yeah, exactly. You just carry this like sad thing you can do and you don't tell. I guess the theory is I think first of all, people are superstitious. Second of all, for those that don't know, in the first like, I dunno, a couple of months, it's very common that you could have a miscarriage and I didn't move. Yeah. Because it's like you don't talk about it. Why not talk about it? Like you'll say when you were sick, you'll talk about it.

Speaker 3:          00:05:25       Yeah. Or if you have to do a surgery. So why is it that I'm like, oh, you're right. And it's a, it's a sad thing. It's a vulnerable thing and it's kind of sucks to just carry that sound. Okay with you. I mean, but I, I guess the theory is that yeah, people would probably just are superstitious about it and then you have, maybe it happens, sometimes people have like many miscarriages. It could happen like five times and you're like, oh fuck, I got to do this whole thing. Like the whole congratulate were not pregnant. We're pregnant, we're not

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       putting, you know, but I'm, Isla approached me a couple of days ago and she's like, I was in bed just looking at the news or something. She's like, eat. Then we got a problem something. And I didn't answer for a minute listening. I'll just kind of groggy and he said something like two stripes. And I was like, what? No Way. Yeah. When I did the test I felt like, I felt like there's no way. I'm like, Oh yeah, we've been trying for a while. You know the boys can swim. It's good to know though, because it was kind of where I was worried that, um, we don't, you worry. That's what, well, what's wrong? What's going on? You know, why can't I, why can't, why can't they get in there taking birth control like maybe almost two years ago at this point? So it could be, that can take a while, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       But, uh, so my, so it worked. The boys can swim, the girls can catch and the team is functioning. You know, Ella started like a week ago before we knew she was preggo. She's like, I'm hungry. Like, yeah, she started eating, she had pizza and she's like, and I have to tell you this, this was shitty pizza. And I'm not one to say that because pizza and my opinions like sex, when it's good, it's great and when it's bad it's pretty good. But I'm like, this pizza is kind of sucky. And he was like, really? This is the best pizza I've ever had. And I'm just like, are you feeling okay? This piece is not that good. I don't know why you tripping about it. But I think ilos starting to get getting hungry. Hm. I don't know if it's even happens that early, but I can't, I haven't been, I don't know. You said you feel something going on in your stomach? Yeah, I feel like things are moving in my stomach.

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       It's a fucking baby dude. So anyway, so guys don't tell anyone, don't tell anyone please til 10 weeks. So between all of us, um, and I don't know how to feel about it. I mean we've been trying for a while, but I was like just so used to not getting pregnant. I was like, oh cool. I was like, cool man, fuck that shit. But now I'm like, I take care of a kid when I'm so dysfunctional. Isla believes in me and that's all that matters. Well, anyway, give us pregnant. So there you have it at long. Yes, yes. Thank you. That is true. That's how I feel. Uh, so we thought we'd share that happy news with everybody and thank you for joining us on this blessing Friday to share these beautiful, wonderful news. Me inside internally. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Um, let's move on. We've got Shane now the shame documentary. We had talked about it in a previous episode and I give Shane all the credit in the world. I mean, this guy has pioneered a new form of content on you. Okay. And he's got this incredible fan base and he,

Speaker 3:          00:09:13       the numbers are just like unpressed. Unbelievable. You had like 10 to 20 million that has 600,000 lights

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       on a tweet. Yeah. What is going on? Yeah, it's wild. So I mean, obviously hats off to the, to the guy. He's a friend of the show. Even though, even though, even though he betrayed me after awhile. Okay, cut. We're not yet. We'll get there. Yeah. Not yet. Let's at least get into a little bit before the possible father. Yeah, exactly. Reliving the memory of that great betrayal. Anyway, so he goes on. As we touched on in the last episode, the chain starts exploring this theory. What if Logan is the sociopath and Jake is living in the shadow of Logan. The sociopath took a weird turn. We're just all became about who is a sociopath. Then like, well the next episode was him sitting for like 40 or 50 minutes with a therapist

Speaker 4:          00:10:16       and

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       super dramatic kind of,

Speaker 4:          00:10:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       She's really dramatic, kind of trying to diagnose him.

Speaker 4:          00:10:27       And

Speaker 1:          00:10:29       Anyway, Logan Paul made a response video and I mean a lot of people have been criticizing Shane for his kind of, the way that he's been trying to diagnose him. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:10:41       cause he does this funny, anything that's there, him and his editor are really good at where they created this like a whore. They create an atmosphere and a tension in the editing is very good. They're good at it, but it's like you're also talking about something serious. You're talking about person,

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       you're talking about mental health. And we know Paul Logan. Paul, which are like the two, you know, dom, Youtube. But regardless, I'm not even trying to make a serious point about chain. I don't, I honestly, I'm not here to refute or talk about any, I honestly, Logan Paul made a response video and it's given us, us all here, one of the best gems that have ever come across this platform. And so this to me was what was most important to share with you guys. Um, I'll let logan speak for himself now. He, he goes on the record, he's, and he actually says, I'm not a sociopath, but I do have sociopathic tendencies, which is interesting. It sounds like he's been diagnosed the way he talks about it because he's very knowledgeable and he goes, you're not either a sociopath or not a sociopath is it's a sliding scale. And some people have more sociopathic tendencies. Yeah. Others. Um, but he goes on to say something that really resonated with me and made me really understand what he meant by that. So I'll share it with you guys now.

Speaker 5:          00:12:02       It or sociopathic mark jobs. Nope. Steve Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs. A lot of people, especially youtube tubers and Shane touched on this, you can't just say like you're a sociopath. The word I would like to use is sociopathic tendencies. A lot of us, me included, we'll do some dumb shit. Maybe some stuff that lacks empathy strictly for views, right? It gets US views which gets us subscribers are motivating factor. If it's to reach the next, next, next level. Sociopath is boiled down. Someone who is just more savage then everyone else. I know it sounds

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       so that's it. I mean that's pretty much a clinical definition of sociopath. Somebody who is more savage than everybody else. And um, I think Logan for that definition and I just think, and I'm just happy that that's in the world. Logan Paul saying it's just someone that's more savage than everybody else. Dabble. Dab. Double Dab will do. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:13:07       Motivating factor if it's to reach the next, next, next level. Sociopath is boiled down. Someone who is just more savage than everyone else. I know,

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       I've just, I have a, I have trouble with that. I'm having trouble with that comparison cause he's always making it cool for his friends because they're always like Saburn yeah. That's what savage means. Cool. Right. His world. So a Sociopath I think Aka ace, antisocial personality disorder, which is someone that lacks empathy. Someone who has a general, I mean I again, I'm not going to, it's not an, it's not generally, it's not, I want to call it sad. I won't call it savage necessarily. You know, maybe a psycho. And then Ethan, did you go through psychology school? Cause I am not a, I'm not a trained professional because I don't know savage sounds to me it does sound very clinical. Yeah. That it sounds like something you'd hear in a classroom. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:14:10       this whole argument though, that between him and Shane, like it's just, I feel like we shouldn't be this whole thing about self-diagnosing and I feel like even Logan's definition is wrong. Cause I was trying to read about it online and educate myself a little bit before I came and did this podcast. And apparently sociopathy isn't even a clinical term. The real clinical term is antisocial personality disorder. And it's just this whole messy thing. I don't like that. It's just, I dunno

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       everyone always just google lang and self diagnosis.

Speaker 4:          00:14:42       Yeah. And like, but anyway, Logan's defending himself. He does make a lot of good points in here, but I'm a sociopath is basically someone that's more savage.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       So to add that to the Wiki page. Yeah. Essentially we need to add that to the clinical definition of, but it's someone that lacks empathy, so much, very manipulative. Someone that doesn't mean they lack empathy, they cannot relate with human emotion. So it enables them to do more callous things that many of us will not feel comfortable doing from an empathetic standpoint. And so I guess that would make them literally more savage and a psychopath, which is a problem. Shane kept saying a sociopath and a psychopath of the same thing and applying, I don't think he said it's the same thing, but he wasn't very clean and very like it kept mixing them up at some point, which is, well he would say sociopath and then he would show psychopath on the screen and like someone with a knife. So I was reading about this, trying to figure out what is the difference.

Speaker 1:          00:15:40       So actually all psychopaths are sociopaths, but a psychopath is a more severe, um, version of a sociopath. They tend to be more violent, they tend to be more criminal and they tend to be more ruthless. A sociopath can still have bonds with like family members and strong friends, but random people and did the meet on the street. They do not have any empathy for it all. So there is a distinction, but this implication that they're all, you know, creepy murders is not, is not true. But at any rate, um, at any rate, that's that. Then there was a part at the end of Shane's new, I've, I, I'm checking out on this, on this documentary. Honestly, it's so long. It's too, it's a lot. But this part made me uncomfortable. I'm not going to lie. So he's teasing. This one's called the enemies of Jake Paul and he is teasing. And the next episode, this therapist that he sat down with is going to go undercover as a producer. Secretly. They're not going to tell Jake Paul so that she can study him all day and make a diagnosis of him. It seems kind of unethical. It's just, I mean if was all here, here, here it is. I mean I, the whole thing is making me uncomfortable. Honestly.

Speaker 1:          00:17:02       Shane does acknowledge that. I mean he knows that it's weird that still's going to do it. But anyway, here it is

Speaker 6:          00:17:14       and she's there the whole time. I don't think he's going to be like, I don't think it's going to be comfortable. I think he's going to be kind of fake. So I came up with a plan is I'm going to the therapist to be, he's going to be the whole day watching, listening.

Speaker 1:          00:17:44       I love to shop, wash this body language like a corner of her eye. Like that's how she makes her diagnosis. Like she's, this is her all day. I just love the image of this therapist with them all day like this. Just looking at the side of her vision at them anyway. It's pretty with straight. I don't know man. It's shit strange. Like, I mean, so here you,

Speaker 6:          00:18:17       it's like when the camera turns off throughout the day, she's going to take me to another room. Jake will have no idea. And then we'll go on to the of the room. I'll just be like going, what do you think? Well first of all, let me say this g specifically.

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       There you go. I Dunno. It's weird. It like, I feel like it's unnecessary because if you, if she went like jake would still be himself over a long day, you know, if they're at his house, well you'll put on a show for like five minutes, but eventually it'll be himself. A sociopath apparently is capable and well aware of the facade that they put on. Actually what I read is that a psychopath, so a sociopath generally is more messy and how they present themselves to the world. But a psychopath is extremely efficient that they can have a mask up all the time, even under stress and duress so that they never let their guard down. Yeah. So it is one of the attributes. But that being said, I really don't think Jerry is like, I really don't think jake is a sociopath talking about Jake Paul. Yeah, I, the thing is he didn't really need this whole angle. I would have been interested at just one, a really sincere look and to Jake Paul's life. Like I don't know why they were down. Yeah. I don't know that we needed this really dramatic angle of sociopathy. Yeah, yeah. Cutie pie made a video about it. He made some good points about a really long video, but he was like, when they were talking about sociopathy, him and the therapist were saying that it was like icky and gross, I guess. I don't know what do I know? But it's getting bizarre.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       It's a wild ride, man. This is some wild new territory here. People are loving it. Yeah. And the thing is, it's Jake Paul, so it's hard for anyone to be like, it's very difficult to ever take cake or logan site. Like Logan made a very reasonable response to two chainz video and it has like, firstly, yeah, he did. Like I was, I was feeling kind of bad that like here they're down. Votes is like 130,000 down and he didn't really say anything or did they have a downvote personally? My pain, that's the world we live in. That's the tube we tube in and so uh, I'm not going to lie. I'm going to watch it. I'm going to watch it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       It seems unethical but I'm going to watch the fuck out of it. What else? We got Kevin. Ugh, Kevin on this fucking guy, this cabinet guy. He's trying to get on the supreme court again, there's a lot of politics going on here. You guys probably heard of Kevin Hawk and how he was accused of all this. A sexual misconduct which is sexual misconduct. That's a nice way of saying rape kind of, but regardless of what he did or didn't do, I don't know. My only interest in this, my friends is the fact that they are arguing over what is a booth now goofing is a big part of this show. As you may recall, we have been trying to get to the bottom of what a booth is for a long time. I feel bad for that. Right into the equation. A booth and a goof and a gaf is alive.

Speaker 1:          00:21:38       What happens if you booth a goof? Now we were wondering what's a booth and Eric from common etiquette came in with a definition as we were wondering what is a boob? And I look it up, it's not actually a word, but you found it on urban dictionary the best, which is the perfect place to define something like this apparently, and correct me if your definition is wrong, it's when you shove drugs up your ass, when you go to a rave or dance party, you boost it in. We're on the same page. So actually I've got to revive that definitional that I'm pretty sure it means taking drugs up the ass because what I've heard, yeah, because apparently the, the anus, the colon is very absorbed. Absorbative absorbative and so drinking is like, you know, and it's like you're doing an Ama, we'd all be like this, you know, this man where it's like I sleep, I am awake. So drinking alcohol in the mouth, I sleep booping alcohol and your ass. I'm awake.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       Yes. So basically the, the aim anus sucks and as way more membrane. So if you're taking any kind of elicit drug, you put it up the ass boy and you all going to be get taken that one rate, right ticket to Valhalla. If you're willing to do that, you don't have to taste it. You don't have to encounter any beds. You just boof it right up there. What do you shotgun a beer up your ass. I don't know how that works. I heard there was kids that were dipping vodka or tampons in vodka and then shoving it up their ass. They get drunk. It's like she's just drinking his drinking. Um, but apparently you get drunk quicker and it's a pleasant experience. But I just, I love, you know, postman is really good at shotgunning beers. I don't know how fast you can boot it. Didn't a friend of the show Steevo uh, in one of those jackass movies moved to a beer out of like a beer bong.

Speaker 1:          00:23:37       That's what I'd like to see post malone done. I think that's the next rockstar that, um, I just like to imagine someone on their back with their cheeks out in a bunch of Bros shoving that tube up. Dude's ass and vaseline ended up by tyra banks and I'm just boof and a beer right up the stink hall. What was their ranks doing? She's the vaseline goddess. Shannon, your picture of she, they use vaseline from her. It's the good stuff. Yeah. If, if Austin is going to be goofing any beers, I want to make sure he gets the best vaseline to lube that Ayn is up because that's obvious. So much easier than drinking it. But at any rate, let's watch, let's watch a future Supreme Court justice discuss boofy and this is the greatest time. What have you, I don't know if it's booked or buffed files.

Speaker 1:          00:24:31       Do you pronounce that Trevor? First of flatulence? No, it does not refer to flashlights a. We all know, even if you support this guy, you know that this guy is not talking about flatulence. So fights, alliances, the farm when in and guys, and again, I'm not taking sides. I'm not throwing my shit. I don't, I'm so over politics. Okay, I'm here for the boots and the boots, but we all know, all of us watching, even those of you who support cavenaugh and everything he does, you know, whatever. What the fuck ever. You know what a booth is

Speaker 1:          00:25:12       and this man, did they ever get to what a goof is? They didn't ask that. Michelle was there. I'd tell them what is a goof? Define a goof. It's Kinda hard to define. It's a laugh. Giggle, giggle. Um, this guy, if he goes down for lying about what a boof is, perjury. Now we've made America great again. I mean, he lied to the Senate. I mean, right here. We all know what a brewery, right? It's perjury of the highest order. We've all, everyone here who is a fan of this podcast and listens here on regular basis in your deposition that they asked you to define what a meme is very similar moment. Meme is kind of hard to define. A booth has a very literal definition is not a flatulence. Flatulence. No, it does not, but I'm saying that we've all here who've been a fan of washed along and learned along with us. We all learned together. What is goofing. Yeah, and this judge who wants to sit on the highest court in the world,

Speaker 1:          00:26:20       he committed perjury over what it means to put beer up his ass. He should go down for that. I'm saying if you're showing us like, I haven't ever heard that he's a nice word for partying. Yeah. He's went to Yale so he's not allowed to say fart. He has to say flatulence, but what have you. It's just like that's when you put up your ass that the, because they'd be like, look, I was 15 I was 16 years old. We were young boys. It's a joke. It's what happens is putting beer up your ass and get him more credit. Would people be like, that guy's telling the fucking truth. You wouldn't lie about that. I mean, I guess he was trying to be more for him. He kept trying to downplay his drinking. So that's what it was. He's always trying to be like, oh, nothing. And there has anything to do with drinking. Look Dude, you put some, you, you took some beer up the ass. I get it, man. We're all trying to have fun. You were a young man at the time.

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       Yup. By the way, this guy's name is Mr. White House. I wonder what kind of job that goes after my jam in a president called Mr. White House President White House. This just in from the White House. Like a papa, John, Papa Johns, Papa Johns, Papa Johns, Papa John. Dot. Papa John. Anyway, I just loved that booth thing has been the center of a national controversy and uh, I had to acknowledge it. So judge, hmm shouldn't have lied about the booth thing. First of flatulence with does not. Absolutely does not. And everyone listening you've got damn well. No it does not. So up next we've got Ian, the intern, the wonderful beloved by all. He has got a presentation. Kanye has been all over the news. People I've been waiting. Yeah, Connie's been up to a lot. And you guys may not know this about Ian to intern, but um, he is a huge Kanye fan.

Speaker 1:          00:28:29       He is a, he's actually even written a screenplay about Kanye is life. Yeah. I didn't know that. You didn't know that. No, he's, he is. I mean he's obsessed. It's a little weird. So he is calm with a presentation and I'm super excited. I mean everything inputs together as gold after that, that's coming up after the break. Then we've got papa John Update. We've got all kinds of fun stuff including this. Check this out. John operates on my favorite updates. Oh God. Every time it's amazing. And this time is no exception.

Speaker 4:          00:35:01       We're here with and the intern who has prepared with us another of his classic powerpoint presentations. Thank you so much him for taking the time, but that together for us. How are you? I'm doing good. I've been working on this a long, long day. It's your life at work. It's the culmination of your life's work emission of a full 24 hours for sure. Are you are a Kanye mega fan, is that correct to say? Yeah, I'd probably say top 100 top 100 fans in the world. I'd say so. That's wow. So if you know anyone disputes that you tried to try me. So the only way you be a bigger fan,

Speaker 7:          00:35:38       it's kind of by stocking him and waiting outside his house and attempting to murder and wearing his skin. Yeah. So you're, you're just one step under us. A psychopathic murderer. Excellent. Good. Now what is it about sociopaths? We shouldn't get any of that. Yeah. Now's not the time or place. He lives at therapist spying on you, but you gotta give me the side load. Yeah. Um, now tell me, what is it about Connie, that intro? Do you, well, let me see. Are you fans of anyone else who has Kanye? Like he's your guy. There's a lot of people I like, but he's definitely, he's your guy. And what is it about Kanye that, that you love so much that he's probably the only person in pop culture that I get close to sing like role model. He's a role model. What are the attributes that you look up to of his, like how his blame honesty that gets him in a lot of trouble, but he feels like one of the only authentic, like everything he thinks, even though, you know, some of it is stupid, he doesn't hesitate to let you know all of his flaws or elders issues.

Speaker 7:          00:36:45       And that's more relatable to me than everyone else. He's authentic. You're like, yeah, definitely. And we see all the faults and the cracks and all of that, and it's, it's like, you know, everyone's like that, but he's like one of the few brave enough to be like, yeah, this is, this is how I am. And I'm kind of, you know, and you're a fan of his music obviously. Yeah, no, he's great. He's your favorite musician as well as artists. Yeah. I love this. Have you seen his sex tape? Wait, he never made any, oh, did you? Have you seen a sex tape? Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about it and had good, good. It's not that good. And all these celebrity sex takes are so underrated. It's like, do you think that she, and they intentionally released that right eye? It's like, not quite sure, but it's true that that sex tape was kind of what put her on the map.

Speaker 7:          00:37:37       Right. It definitely helped before that. And then she was really close with Paris Hilton and was around in those circles and stuff. I think I saw on porn hub that the Kim Kardashians sex tape has like over a hundred million views and crazy. Yeah. No, it's like massive on there. It's pretty wild. Um, okay. You've seen it. Yeah. I mean, okay. Yeah. That's good. I don't know if I've seen it. I mean, you're not missing much. It's just, it's a lot of like Dude Pov, right? Yeah. It's just, it's bad angles. You just can't really enjoy the show as they say. How many times have you watched it? More than often? Just every once in a while. No, not even recently. I like multiple times. Well, no, I respect Kim and the fans. You don't watch it anymore, but before, how many times have you seen it? More than five times or less than five times less?

Speaker 7:          00:38:26       Be Honest. Honestly, I'd say less. I would tell you the truth. Like three, three, four, four and a half? Yeah. Well, obviously has, I mean you have to be crazy to watch the whole thing. Um, and are you a fan of Kim Kardashian as much as Anya? Not as nowhere near, but I've come to like her through. Do you see what he finds him? Her like the, yeah. What is fine? I'm serious. Well that's another, both of these people are so hated, like vitriolic, like fury. And I think it's, it's a, you know, a little unnecessary. She's like everything she just did, getting that woman out of prison. That was very cool. And she's actively, it's weird. There's pictures of her. Just she's going to the White House. No, kind of semi-regular hanging out and trying to, she has a whole list. It's trying to fucker. Oh yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:39:28       All right. Let's get started into the, what is then, what is this Kanye? What verse? The world. What are we calling this? A kanye decoded Kanye. He coded. Wow. Yeah. My hand. Amen. Go right in. So, jobs, Ford, Edison, Disney. I see where this is going. And Stein Picasso. How many of these, how many please? I'm, I'm in the middle of something here. Shakespeare, uh, Andy Warhol. Warhol. Thank you. I forgot for a second. As long as tweets, a Dora the explorer launch Schwietz apparent on Vanilla pea. Von [inaudible] was strong. Start here again. The Vinci, you know, uh, Hughes. Phelps. Did you rehearse this? Socrates? I'm get, I'm getting to a thing. Tesla. You know, Michelangelo, my God. Hawking, are you trolling me? Is there a presentation or is it just thing they're getting their Beethoven Jackson Buddy. The Elf. Not, not welfare old then health, but he's just west. Oh, are you with me so far? I think so. What is it you're trying to say? And great mind, these are all people Kanye is compared himself to.

Speaker 7:          00:41:09       Wow. Okay. So you definitely, you had a thing here. Yeah, there's, there's reason behind the madness. Hey, so, and I shouldn't have doubted, you know that Elf, what did you, who was that? A Disney. Oh, von Schwietz. I need to compare itself to launch tweets. He said, cause if you've seen record Ralph. Yes. She like is it the, she's the glitch. Kanye says I'm the glacier glitch. We're going to decode that right now. And you know, that is what we're trying to do for the Matrix. Kanye d coated the enigma of political affiliation. A lot of people are upset about, you know, this guy's recent activities. Absolutely. Yeah. Uh, it kind of kicked off a few weeks ago. He announced his new album, Yon d uh, he said it was coming out September 29th. Yani is Kanye and Gandhi. That's not a bold claim. And here's the album cover. It's similar to his album from 2013.

Speaker 7:          00:42:08       Yeezus. So this is the, these making a play on word that he's some kind of savior. But does he actually believed that because he is, has manic states. Does he believe he is uses probably in those states. He's gets close. Uh, especially recently. He's on this whole love thing I'm talking about, but so he releases this September 29th and then I gave it a little spin there. SNL announced that he would be the highest on the 29th or he'd, he'd be the musical guest. So everyone assumed, okay, he's going to come, he's going to play some new songs. The album will come out. So first song, I'm sure you saw this performance. I love it. Yeah. It's catching a little pod. Can My head song one? We're having fun. We're having fun out here song too. So cool. So cool. I think those are summaries of that experience.

Speaker 7:          00:43:08       Yeah. That's my review. Came out and played a song called we got love. Great. Very cool song. Three liberals can't control me. Takes a turn, hold on. Takes a turn. And people weren't quite happy about it. Uh, he launched into his speech at the end of, he was playing ghost town and then NBC cut the Stream. Wow. They cut him off. Yeah. I haven't seen this. And some, some people are saying, oh, it was just because they ran out of time, but it was right before he launched into his speech and someone recorded it who was backstage. They cut it. It never got aired. Yeah. So, uh, here's the recording from one of his main producers. It was backstage

Speaker 8:          00:44:11       one trump thing. Cath laughing in the background. Superman Cape on this means you can't tell me what to do. That's how we control. That's how we're programmed. If you want the world to move forward, try love. Thank y'all for giving me this platform. I know. I don't agree. He's killing it though. 90% of news are liberal. No, that can't be true. 90%. And they do your writers, rappers, musicians. So it's easy to make it seem like it's so, so, so one sided and um, they're just stuck up there. Them hold them hostage a little bit. I've talked to this country also. They're very anti trump, so he's Kinda bitching them out. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:45:31       Got

Speaker 3:          00:45:31       It. You know what? I thought that was a beautiful, authentic tender moment. And to real goddamn shame they caught them off. Like that gives you a context to why he's wearing this hat kind of feel like they should have kept it. It's not really, I mean it is obviously very provocative, but I understand, I appreciate the point he's trying to make of like stepping across the aisle and seeing people as people and not because it's so easy from the left or right to just demonize and that's what they do. Cause like I wish a while a lot of left wing, uh, media like Jimmy Kimmel and the Steven Colbert is and all these guys and they're just, they talk about, and Bill Maher, it talked about the other side. Like they're just monsters. You know, Bill Murray, who was the only one that actually we'll have a conversation without her side only.

Speaker 3:          00:46:17       But like G-man, chemo treats them like they're monsters. Yeah. So I appreciate the sentiment and there was another part, I don't know where it went by, where he said like, you guys kind of go at trump like a little too hard and it's nonstop, but it doesn't really help anything. Yeah. So he told them as well, like I love how he's like thank you for a platform. And they're like, dude, we pulled the plug two minutes. They're like, we gotta get this guy out of here. Man. I feel bad. I, well, I'm glad that somebody recorded it. Yeah. How have people reacted to that clip? Not Gray. Not Gray. No. Um, there was another one that everyone saw first. Chris Rock was in the audience and he was filming it and he's just laughing. Chris Rock filmed it. What a weird twist. Yeah. I'm on his instagram story and you could hear him chuckling and being like, oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:47:10       Right. Well what do you expect this Kanye West. Yeah. You know, that's, it's weird that he would have that risk surprised. But also I find it, I find that a little bit rude and condescending to laugh at a guy who's trying to express himself authentically. It's like listen to the guy, you know what I'm saying? That's kind of the point that he's making cause just because he's wearing that hat is immediately labeled like a joke and it's like why can't anyone where like 50% of the country apparently supports Donald Trump and rocks that hat. So why is it like that when you wear that hat it's like wearing a swastika or some shit. It's like that's the

Speaker 7:          00:47:47       neighbors. Yeah, the hat is, it's getting such like a visceral immediate response from people and then they don't want to dig deeper.

Speaker 3:          00:47:55       But again, I'm sure there's, I feel like I'm maybe supporting that too much because then there's a lot of people like, well he said, I'm going to say one way or the other. I appreciate the act of trying to reconcile these very fractured cup country that we live in. I mean I had that immediate reaction when I saw him with the hat on the show. I was like, Ugh, why are, yeah my wearing that. And like that was my first reaction. But it's all just like, Oh Paul, we're all so sick of politics too. It's like, I just fucking make music and entertain us.

Speaker 7:          00:48:23       Because there's also people that are like, oh, well he's only doing that because he doesn't really care. He's just, he's in the headlines. Again, I don't believe that because he kept doing after his last album came out a lot of shit for it. So the day after that, then he posts his photo. That's the funny thing. I have instagram and the caption. This represents good and America becoming whole again. We will no longer outsource to other countries. We build factories here in America and create jobs. It will provide jobs for all who are free from prisons as we abolished the 13th amendment message sent with love. I'm not sure the trumps anything about bringing people from prison. Yeah, he's, and then this kind of in some trouble because yeah, this, this is, this is less about, this is more political. This is like I'm a, I support Donald Trump. Yeah. And then the, he said abolished the 13th amendment, which is the one that, yeah, the whole sentence slavery. But then there's like a section of that that says, except for p praise resins. And he later said, I meant the word amended.

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       It's like, Bro, you got to clarify that. Like, come on. You got to know that doesn't come off good with them. With a maggot hat. Yeah. And I think he's still trying to be like this. I'm reaching across. A lot of people have pointed out that like the Migraine hat has a label that says made in China. And so it's like, if you want to start the movement, well, you know, there's this great clip of when Donald was running for the Republican nominee, he went on Jimmy Kimmel. It was so great. And camel had a bunch of trump ties with the label made in China,

Speaker 7:          00:50:06       you know? Yeah. So then the response to this, here's a couple reacts reactions. Evans, Captain America, Captain America. I'm with a lot of life. He jumped in 600,000 lights. Yeah. So, uh, he's response, there's nothing more maddening than debating someone who doesn't know history. It doesn't read books and frames or Myopia is virtue. The level of conjecture I've encountered lately isn't just frustrating. It's retrogressive unprecedented. An absolutely terrifying

Speaker 1:          00:50:34       that got 600,000 likes. I don't think people even understood like he got away too hard to sound smart there.

Speaker 7:          00:50:40       Yeah, he went all in. He, he got the webster's out.

Speaker 1:          00:50:43       He fought. That was straight up cause sponsored by thesaurus.com. Um, yeah, curiously 600,000 people slammed that. I mean that's just such, I mean I,

Speaker 7:          00:50:56       yeah. And then Lana Delray commented this one had like right under his photo. This one had like 30,000

Speaker 1:          00:51:05       by the way, I want to say it once again for the record, not, I'm not supporting in favor of Donald Trump and in fact I want to say he definitely made it to political at that point. Yeah. I didn't like that one. He cause then again, it's like, oh, we're talking about bringing, it's like, Eh, I like, I liked the gesture of healing the divide, but then he made a political and using these talking points and I so I understand the backlash at that point should have kept it pure about just you've got to stick to walk point. Yeah. I like it where he's like, don't scape goat me just because I liked this guy along 50% of the America, but now you got, Chris Evans is going@thesource.com and writing a dissertation, a thesis, a doctoral, uh, on it. Dr America. Okay. I cannot believe 600,000 people pretended to understand what he just dropped.

Speaker 1:          00:52:02       I can or you can't understand. I can believe that. That there's nothing more maddening than debating someone who doesn't know history, doesn't read books and frames their Myopia as virtue. What the level, unapologetic conjecture. What the fuck? Just say what you mean like you do. Why are you writing a essay on twitter? The level of unapologetic conjecture of accountability isn't just frustrating. It's retrogressive unprecedented and Apps Shit, dude. I said, when you're gonna to like criticize it Kanya for not being educated, then you come up with the, I dare you to, what about the dictionary and deep belled this tweet such a pompous like just fucking say what you want to say, dude. You don't like what the guy says. You think he's on the educated and uh, you know,

Speaker 7:          00:52:54       yeah, he definitely went a little overboard. And then Lana del Rey, trump becoming our president was a loss for the country, but you were support of him is a loss for the culture. Uh, I can only assume you were late to his personality on some level. Delusions of grandeur, extreme issues with narcissism. None of which would be a talking point if we weren't speaking about the man leading our country. If you think it's all right to support someone who believes it's okay to grab a woman by the pussy just because he's famous, then you need an intervention. As much as he does something, so many narcissists we'll never get because there just isn't help for the issue. Message sent with concern that we'll never be addressed. Hmm. So that's real beef. That's beef. She performed at his wedding. Well, oh,

Speaker 1:          00:53:36       so tell me, how do you feel about, because about what Kanye said as a fan and a student of his,

Speaker 7:          00:53:42       I think that, I think that he's going about it the completely wrong way. Right. And I see, I see what he's trying to do and I'm not going to get, like, I think people aren't shocked because I was looking up like what celebrities actually endorsed trump. And it's a real row of character,

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       not the, not the best. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:54:08       Like far and away the most relevant entertainer to everyone was the other one roach. Neat loaf and shit like that. It's like meatloaf. The first one was Roseanne. That was the first one that popped up. Oh, sorry. One Sec. Yeah. And like I'm whole Cogan you know, so yeah, I think people can't believe that because no one else has even getting close to that conversation who was popular and so, and then the last one was from questlove. He said, you know, we aren't even typing his name. I find it strange. She's and trending get, we're all typing the same thing for all that he's canceled talk. There was an ounce of hope in our souls tonight, but all we got was, well, I'm kind of sad man, that was about the snl performance. So all three of those guys jumped in and then snoop, snoop, snoop went in for the kill. This guy named Dj Pooh, uh, re posted the photo and said, Magda music ain't getting attention. So he's saying he's kind of Promo. Sure. And then snoop and the comments make your music again. Bleep and word. Yeah, yeah, yeah. With an a at the end. And then he called him uncle Tom.

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       No, uncle Tom. Um, for those of you who don't know, cause he didn't know what that is. There was a book, I don't remember what it was called, right, but a fictional character. It was called a uncle Tom's cabin. Oh yeah. Uncle Tom's cabin. A black man that owned slaves. So he's betraying his own kind, in other words. Yeah. So he, he said that

Speaker 7:          00:55:48       and he was a earlier posts from him. What the fuck? This was from one connie. First put the hat on, he said the new Kanye, well all white now way to go, dude edited him, you know, so he used to be mad at Connie for awhile after this one on the left. Then Connie went out and wore a picture of snoop dogg on his shirt and then immediately snoop dogg posted it and said forgiveness is everything. So he won him over.

Speaker 1:          00:56:20       He's easy. And then like, like, yeah. Of,

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       and then I look how good was like you uncle Tom, which is kind of like the worst thing you could say to it. Another block. I mean that's, that sounds a lot of hay. Right. And then he just wears the shirt while still having them. Yeah. But I, but again, it's great. That's what he's, you know, he's trying to do. But I think Kanye beautifully disarmed that situation. Yeah. And it worked. Yeah. It worked. But I was like, so who's forgiving who in that scenario? You know what I mean? Snoop, I guess didn't, was forgiving Kanye because he wore the acknowledged him, cause that's, you know, I'm going to have to use that. Who am I wrong? I got to start wearing this shirt. It's the move. That's the move for sure. Yeah. And then trump tweeted after the s and l performance, like many, of course you have a trump.

Speaker 7:          00:57:14       You had one last week. The Tra like, man, no, I'm not like, I can do my best as Stephen Colbert doing trump. Yeah. That's, nobody wants that. Like many, I don't watch Saturday night live. You have a trump? No, not a good one. Like man. I mean it's all, yeah, it's just this. It's okay. Good. Yeah, we get it. Let's go ahead. Like many, I don't watch Saturday night live, even though I passed, hosted it. No longer funny. No talent or charm. It is just a political ad for the dems word is that Kanye west who put on a mega ha after the show, despite being told no was great. He's leading the charge. Very cool. Kanye and very cool. Uh, so everyone's kind of going, but why, why is he doing this? Why is he, you know, taking his legacy like this? Did you make this fun?

Speaker 7:          00:58:06       No. No, I can't. It's a good, good. Uh, so you got to go back to 2013. This isn't the first time he's done this. A lot of people kind of forgot. He put out his album yeezus and June of 2013 and then he put out all of the merge and all of the merge was covered in the confederate flag. Wow. That's pretty racy. Yeah. Literally. And so that was a huge thing at the time. Then I didn't see that everything we were falling client so close. They look like a midget. Oh, kind of like until we met. Yeah. I'm not supposed to be a midget and I guess I ain't either. Yeah. So a bunch of the merge had, a lot of people were upset and here's a clip of him in 2013 explaining why he wore, why he wore the confederate flag, merge

Speaker 9:          00:59:03       the tour, merge she I Red Eye, which I thought was kind of like the people. I thought people just want to find something to get. Yeah. You know, I just want to get all riled up about something. But it was about the tour merchant, the confederate flags in the skeleton imagery and things like that. I mean, do you think people are overreacting with this? React how you want? And I got said it's making react, I guess. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       Energy. You got as good energy. You know, the confederate flag represented slavery in a way. The way my mom's shot, that's about abstract take on what I know about it. Right. So I made the song new slaves, so I took the confederate flag and made it my flat. It's my flag now. Now just go and do. I like that.

Speaker 7:          00:59:42       Yeah. That's great. That's a great, that's beautiful. I love that. And then just this was the day before the snl performance, or he was explaining the maggot hat.

Speaker 10:         00:59:53       I redesigned it. I've been changed the Brim, change the shape right here, and I'll put positive energy into the hat.

Speaker 7:          01:00:03       That's what he said about it there. Yeah. But he fucked it up when he started talking about political point. Yeah, that's definitely where it's getting fucked that up. Yeah. I think he started with this idea and then a bunch of sort of a right. You know, I'm right leaning. People in, in media started reaching out to him and he started taking meetings with them and I think then they got in his brain, he got some, yeah, he got some talking points from them and you know, see, there you go. He's becoming what he hates. Kind of. Isn't it true? I think that he really, I don't think there's any maliciousness. No, I know, but he'd be coming, but he's almost upon to the, uh, well, whatever, what the fuck do I know? It's kind of like, you know, pulling whispering in his ear and he's coming out.

Speaker 7:          01:00:53       Yeah. Talking about the, you know, bringing jobs back or whatever. Not that that's a bad thing, but it is a talking point. Yeah. And then, let's see, so that was from that thing. He's wearing a make America great again hat. And then his sweater is Colin Kaepernick. Um, he's keeps trying to do this duality thing. These are all the people he follows on twitter. It's like Bernie Sanders trump. Uh, and then he, he followed those two at the same exact time. Bernie and trump. And then he followed Candice Owens who is a Republican. I'm a media personality. And Emma Gonzales who was kind of, she was leading the Antigua. Yeah. He followed them at the exact same time to at exact same time. Yeah. It was like a media. So he's trying to create a statement. Only eight followers. Yeah. It's exclusive club. Interesting. Someday get in that club.

Speaker 7:          01:01:56       Who is your opposite match? Yeah. I don't know. I don't want to have to find a nemesis free. Uh, here's a tweet. I haven't done enough research on conservatives to call myself or be called one on just refusing to be enslaved by monolithic thought. And all right. Um, here's a, it's more of just him saying, you know, the hat, it's not about policies. I'm not a politician like that. It represents overcoming fear and doing what you felt. No matter what anyone said, you can't bully me. Liberals can't bully me. News can't bully me. The hip hop community can't believe me. Uh, and here's Kim's saying, you know, we would talk about policies and he doesn't agree with the policies. He likes his personality and how he made it to be president when everyone really underestimated him essentially. All right. And then the next, the dragon energy.

Speaker 7:          01:02:45       Yeah. And here's one of his good friends after the, after the performance, he has never said he agrees with trump's policies. Just the fact that no one would have thought trump would be president, meaning he did the emba. Unbelievable. And that's the connection. Only him wearing the hat is his choice and he feels he's stripping the power of hate. That people give that hat by wearing it and wants to love all no matter how they speak of him or whatever we don't agree with because that's how God works. God loves all. If he was trying to strip the power of hate that people give it by wearing it, he would. He's never said that. No, not well, he said he put like positive energy into the hat, but what does that, oh, it means it's like diamond water. They run it through and he liked it when asked about the core energy. And he's right. He washed it and dining and water. I'm going to ask you about the confederate flag. He gave it very straightforward explanation. He said this is represents slavery and now it's mine. Yeah. Okay. Well yeah. Okay. God bless. God loves all. Uh, and then here's a quick clip he was asked about if you liked why he is showing support for trump. Oh wait, where'd it go?

Speaker 7:          01:03:58       There we go.

Speaker 3:          01:03:59       So maybe that's what you liked the idea? Yeah. Not necessarily. I do. Donald Trump with the idea of an outside of infiltrating. Yeah, I liked it. It showed you that anything is possible shows you that it doesn't even like Virgil, uh, working at Louis Vuitton, trump being in office, it's a time for the unconventional. I'm, I'm very, I'm not a traditional thinker. I'm a non conformist, you know? So that relates to the nonconformists. Pardon me now, you know, but I'm also, I'm a producer. I like to segue things. I'd like to take Otis, chop it up, do it like this. So, so what's the gay version? And the gay version of b, the trump campaign and maybe to Bernie Sanders principles. That would be my mics and stuff. But I think both had, you know, uh, you know, I need it.

Speaker 7:          01:04:51       So that's, there you go. So I don't know where he is with his thoughts on politics. Okay, bye. Are you though? So really the question was like, you know, can you turn this into something positive? Sure. I don't personally, I don't think so. And you liked them to charged like the yeah, you can't in a way like it's hard to just say I just like trump because he made it against all odds without acknowledging everything that he stands for.

Speaker 4:          01:05:28       Well, I also recall him saying that he has he redesigned the hat? Yeah, he has a yeezy version of the make America great again hat that he wears. And I think that's fantastic that he made his own hat

Speaker 7:          01:05:40       there. Yeah, he changed the Brim, changed the thing.

Speaker 4:          01:05:43       Yeah. It doesn't look better. I have to say. It looks, he looks a little goofy when he, the hat fit. Like, if you recall the picture on Instagram, that's like a total goof angle while at any rate, Kanye, he's out there, he's doing his thing, he's authentic. And you as a fan, you love him. You against all odds forever. So what, what if you could say anything to Konya right now, what would you tell him? Kanya is right here. What do you say?

Speaker 7:          01:06:09       I'd probably say, well first I think that um, I appreciate what he's trying to do. Yes. But it's like, it's, it's like a sisyphus task. He's like rolling a boulder to Chris Evans. Yeah, the source out. Um, it's like an, I saw some people going well, like, oh, like the swastika used to be a symbol of peace and then they changed it to make it a different thing. But it's not, once that happens, you can't bring it back. You can't take the Hitler mustache. I said it's like, it's easier to, to poison the, well then to like purify the water. So that's my thinking and trust. If he wants to use the hat, I think he has to design, redesign it a little further and stay out of the political talking points he was saying is trying to remix. Yeah. This ID as Buddy Dan change that had enough. My pitch. I've got a pitch. This isn't the redesign one, but you've got, you know the Democrats typically blue publicans or read the trump has is very red, blue and red combined purple.

Speaker 4:          01:07:27       There it is. Purple Make America great again. That's a brilliant idea. Yes. You

Speaker 7:          01:07:32       change it to purple being or that good ideas. Just that plain hat. What's the goal with make America great again? Right. Well then you change the slogan as well. I looked it up. I went to the meanings of colors and I was ah, I, that's, I was thinking, I was like, what the hell? Okay. Violet, the color of spirituality to energy of red with the calm. Who defines who decides what color means? A lot of these are marketing companies as color plays very heavily. Oh, okay. This is like got it. A, a color that inspires reflection and self awareness. It just the color of the sensitive, compassionate, intuitive soul. Violet has long been associated with royalty and characteristics of quality and luxury. Mom, if you go back to his album, cover the sticker on it was violent. Yes. You think he's onto this already? No, but I'm trying to leave Kanye.

Speaker 7:          01:08:25       Well I think you've got to keep the, make America great again cause then you have both colors the same meaning if you go away from the phrase, it becomes something to different. Combine them. Kanye who is listening for sure obviously listened to end. He's got great advice I think. Or the slogan. I think you could slight, I mean it could go both ways, but I think the color would be a good change. Maybe make America great cause it was not, again, not everyone w it wasn't great for all people at any point. Yeah. I'm Connie. He has this whole thing. He's always talking about, oh we teach history class. Why don't we teach future class, right. That's his whole thing. So look, look forward. Let's make it great. Make America Great. Stop looking bad and not rely am and that's kind of, yeah. Yeah. If I'm maybe both, I said this maybe took a little from him.

Speaker 7:          01:09:19       Make America unified. Yeah. Combination. Okay. Or make America love. Okay. That's a little corny. And, and can mayberry well, I wanted to please all the people out there and I like the upgrades without, it just took a little the about he closes his dream. Make America Great. I do like that one. Okay, thanks. So change the color, change the change of the Brim, all that. Everybody tweaked the Connie, let them know. I think we got it. Yes. Here. If he did that then maybe. Maybe. And do you think that if Kanye adopted your idea from the show, would they give you back membership tier, the Kanye form that you were banned from dance? You already get it back. Well, no, I don't think he did. Every band I'm back, but they don't know I'm, I'm there. Oh, you have a new account. But they, they couldn't know who's here and there.

Speaker 7:          01:10:08       They're onto me. Huh? I, I saw a weird, gave me rolling. Someone commented the other day and they were like, you, the way you type makes it seem like you've been here a lot longer than your registration date. They all know each other, Huh? Yeah. Come get his weight. How many active members is that community? Yeah, well there's, there's like, uh, like 10,000 people on there, but then there's really heavy people on your heavy. Uh, yeah. How many hours a day are you on that? Well, not as much now because if I use it at home, they'll trace my ip. I'm like, alright, I'm in deep know I, the hatch should say unbanned Ian from the forum. But that's funny. We got to pick up on those and you end well, thank you for decoding Kanye. Rest in peace to Mac Miller. I see you're repping that. They're on your hoodie. Yes. Rustin penned a and thanks so much for your presentation. We will show you all the best you can. Leave it out. Thank you so much.

Speaker 1:          01:11:15       Thank you very much. All right, so there you guys have it, uh, the Kanye West d coded. Hmm. What do you take away from that? He led, do you think? What do you think

Speaker 3:          01:11:28       Ian is always making me like see the good in canyon that maybe I didn't save it.

Speaker 1:          01:11:34       No. Well, Ian, he's a good cat. He's got a strong head on his shoulders. Um, so I, I generally, he's got good ideas. Yeah. So when he says that Kanye is his favorite person in the world, I listen. Right. And I'm like, what's going on there? Actually started listening to his new album because of Ian's a doorstop and I got to say, there's a lot of the gravy cottey one. Yeah, there's a lot of good stuff there. So, um, let's make America love again

Speaker 3:          01:12:04       and it's, it's tough to, I, like I said, when I saw him with the hat, I was like, what? Yeah, why? But when you look more into it, I see what he's trying to do. Oh, I see.

Speaker 1:          01:12:19       Hey, God bless it yet. All right, well let's get into, um,

Speaker 11:         01:12:28       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:28       Speaking of, uh, conservatives, Papa John is a prominent conservative. Did you know that? And he is currently under a huge criminal conspiracy by the Clintons and George Soros to remove him from his pizza empire. Can we close it? Oh, sorry. Yeah, that's me. Papa John has showed up to court today. What does it, I think you just got to close that window there on the top right. Hey, there we go. I was like, okay. There you go. Papa John showed up in court today to testify in his lawsuit. Papa John, the Papa John, and he gave testimony. He asked for documents. There's a lot of big updates I'd like to share with you guys as Johnny's Suing Papa John's. Yeah. As the story unfolds, we've got a video here.

Speaker 11:         01:13:20       Here we go.

Speaker 9:          01:13:22       Mr. Schneider is set to begin testifying modern, as you mentioned the wrong, it's Shat Shat. No, it's not her. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:31       Papa John's Shatner's wife on air. Yeah. Schneider should change it. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:13:36       She found her. A former CEO and former chairman of the board is seeking documents related to his ouster as chairman earlier in the summer. Mr [inaudible] said he's feeling good this morning ahead of his testimony. Here's what else he had to say to us. What's your message to shareholders?

Speaker 1:          01:13:56       You guys remember the Papa's in the house where he had the Lav on? Yeah. And he didn't know that you could hear him. He was gone. That's it. Dead eight here a little bit. You can hear him gone. There's

Speaker 4:          01:14:14       right.

Speaker 8:          01:14:17       Same message we would have for 34 years. You know, we always act in their best interest. What's your end goal here? Do you

Speaker 4:          01:14:23       better interest, better pizza, better ingredients up at John's. Always in their best interest. The quality is low because of this virtual desktop, I think. Okay. Yeah. Although it should be yours, not mine. Well, we'll figure it out later. I turned to the company and a leadership

Speaker 8:          01:14:39       position of, I don't want to be in a CEO position for sure, but you know, I uh, I definitely want to be part of it and I am part of the company.

Speaker 4:          01:14:49       I am part of the company that you want. What's the name of the company? What's the name of the company? Papa John's. And who's the Papa? Steve? No, he's actually suing the company. And Steve, he was going to fire Steve. Did you know there's the pizza gus and Gung Ho by Air Steve and now he's the CEO. Ah, it's a drama is so good. I'm telling you they should rename the company at a pop. Steve's Kinda Nevan the pizza boxes. No one's going to buy that. Steve. My faith, full employee one day. I'm cool.

Speaker 12:         01:15:30       Steve. I was going to let you go. We'll go to part ways and now you've taken everything from me. Stevie. You can take it in the mirror and her, you've taken the fresh 100% Mozzarella. You've taken it all and now you're changing the name to pump stevie. I want it's better pizza, better ingredients. And now stevie my faith. Fuck out. Come to me and you say you want no problem. My Heart's probably a couple of degrees. You have a call against the family and now I sit and quiet next to you, Stevie, my colleague, my friend. And you sit and you look many eyes and you see this pizza. And by that I built with my hands. You take the Mozzarella at Marin. I needed the door. I Oman's Dave and you sit across from me in court today at Uc Davis. Oh, I won't for Papa John's is for the shareholders to make money better, better pizza. And how might some, boy, he's a slow point. My boat, my son, boy, he doesn't have much prospects. He's got no prospects TV. You'd think as pizza. Em, listen to this. This is a real godfather tail. Um, better interests. Better Pizza. I am part of Papa Joe. Here's part two. You can go ahead and I feel like the music companies, the whole thing,

Speaker 9:          01:17:28       this is all a huge betrayal. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:17:34       Here we go. Hit me with it. Don't you fucking lag out on me. Now.

Speaker 9:          01:17:41       What about Internet? Right? Josh satirize actually just wrapped up his testimony and we aren't getting on his and his team to exit from the courthouse. This is one of two lawsuits that he's filed against the company. I hear he is just coming out right now. You're going to get any comments from [inaudible]. It has 17 different categories of documents that are related to his ouster as chairman of the board today, he really appeared calm and reserved. That's in stark contrast to public comments that he's made and also statements he's put out on his website. Save Papa John's dot com it feels the company didn't properly protect him as founder. After a Forbes reports that he'd used a racial slur on a conference call. It was about a kind of using it as a racial epithet reports in the media mischaracterize what actually happened. Mr [inaudible] today also spoke of an intuition, a sixth sense, a gut feeling.

Speaker 9:          01:18:32       It's something may have been going on with the company and that's why he's trying to seek documents that go back to October 31st he made those. Now Ms comments, nfl and leadership, so he doesn't know if the board's actions and mount to a coup, a conspiracy or perhaps they are acting in the best interest of the company that you want to obtain these documents to try and figure out really what happened here. I also spoke to a source close to the company but at the Johns seemed a bit confused today about what documents he was asking for. That is troubling because he is a direct, just want the, I just want the mirror narrow, clear about what he actually needed. Having that the company really looks forward to moving past these schemas and creating a better papa John's a better culture for the company. Also, we should mention that because we are struggling to meet away from a decision. It was unclear today if the judge from the bench, but by showing again, we're waiting comments from a John

Speaker 12:         01:19:26       and now josh motto and now I'm assuming you going to point some down. Fuck this shit. Fuck this shit. Stevie former colleague and best friend, my a fighter like concierge. See, how do you call that advisor? Constantly air constantly there like the Abbey because my consigliere nailed it. A lie ask is support to return the recipe of and my patented trademark and Mozzarella cheese recipe. Papa John's the Mozzarella. It's diff. It's to milk. It's designed to melt evenly over the pizza. That's the pizza place. I know. What's your stiff? You break, you break.

Speaker 2:          01:20:21       Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:20:24       Stevie, I have to take you on a lake and execute.

Speaker 2:          01:20:27       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:20:33       Listen to this shit. He requests 17 different documents, including the recipe of his Marinara sauce as a joke, but 17 documents Israel, the pizza senses, we're sensing a pizza conspiracy, a coup or conspiracy. Papa speculated that foreign agents maybe act and covertly to overthrow his pizza empire, possibly speculating that it was little seizures or possibly domine hose. The I'm going, I did write this by the way. I spent, I'm this morning right shares dom hose. Yes. Isla. Thank you very much for acknowledging that

Speaker 2:          01:21:10       common hope. Everybody dominant hose. Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:21:17       Only a great mind such as mine could such an original joke. Shares of the company have fallen more than 31% over the last year, but the company's whoa started long before Papa John was locked in a bitter battle since hitting an all time high of 90 cents per share in December of 2016 Papa John's stock has lost nearly half of its value on disappointing same store sales growth. On Monday, the stock was down more than 2% last changing hands at around $50 a share. So they, they were already going down. This supports his pizza conspiracy that the company was not doing well and they wanted him off because he was checking what I pulled up a isla pulled up something he said he planned to fire currency. Oh Steve Richie who knew his performance evaluation would be subpar. Wow. And now stevie is the new pop this up on the night of December 26

Speaker 12:         01:22:25       that won't be a change of events. The or formerly known as papa re Stevie Richie, but no longer control side. The shatner family is over and on the east side we are going to control the mirror and there were supply the moat Sylvana supplying the tomato supply. These boys, the Ritchie family, Dan. Oh God, no. On the trustworthy. Then their performance is subpar. And so what is my well as Grandpapa as the God

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       that the sea, oh richie shall be no more. And so on this day of December 26 pumper Richie, because I give him a kiss and I said, it's the kiss of faith

Speaker 12:         01:23:25       and this time honored more Toronto, this award winning Marin sauce torch. I get the deal, my son, the, the award winning cross that throw with my own pants, don't understand it's a pizza wall. We'll go into a wall.

Speaker 1:          01:23:48       Here's the twist. Here's a big twist within the proceedings, he was asked whether he had some settlements with some women. Shatner stated that he has confidentially agreements with at least two women but didn't specify what those meant. Uh, the woman, 24 year olds all the time sued, shatter, Shat Shat big shanty boy, Papa and 1999 alleging that he had sexually harassed her four months repeatedly visiting her house and kissing her and groping her according to court filing, Shatner has denied the allegations and as they say, papa is and will ever for be in the house. What you just did when you sent that to me? So, um, it's an interesting twist of fate for papa because he went to seek documents to try to prove that it was a pizza conspiracy. But what he did is he unsealed other documents about him being in the house with a, an employee that he allegedly kissed and groped.

Speaker 1:          01:24:52       Papa has denied the allegations. Do you think the Papa, do you think he uses a lube when Esx or Marinara sauce? Probably the Bata. You think he is a boiling pot of sauce? Yeah, he probably does. Doesn't he? Hmm. Oh my God. Oh right. Marlon Brando, the Godfather, the guy that played the godfather was famously in a butter scene where he used butter to lube up his cock to rape a girl in a movie in a movie. So there you have that. Everything connects folks. It's a small world after all as they say. So that's it. That's that. You know what else we got? We got facebook leak. Oh was yeah cause it, Shit. Facebook sucks. What's, what's like Mark Zuckerberg or smoking meats.

Speaker 1:          01:25:53       CSEC is a potential sociopath. That guy acts like a computer emulating him. That's the thing. If you're going to sell, I'm not a therapist, I'm just a fucking idiot. Everyone becomes a sociopath. Yeah, exactly. That's why I find it. I'll just a little irresponsible the therapist, cause you're wielding trust like a doctor that, I don't know if the therapist take o's, but doctors take boats. That's serious stuff, you know? Um, here. So this, this story cracks me up. This is amazing, amazing stuff. Um, Dream cruise nightmare. 1300 Indians partying from a tobacco company, went on a cruise with a 3000 other, I mean, 3000 people in total. So half of those from these Indian company and half was Australian people or just not just for vacation. And these guys just don't took over this cruise ship. They brought playboy playmates, they brought music, they brought their own food, and they just completely terrorized this cruise and everybody was trapped on this cruise and it was so bad that Royal Caribbean's had, they're very fond everybody. But there's just hilarious footage of, um, of all this. And it was like a 24 hour nightmare. And the Saas Jillian station made this really hilarious, like scoop, very serious. Um, they were very serious about it, you know, which I, I just was loving this whole thing. Cruise ruined by 1300 men on a work bender. Here we go.

Speaker 13:         01:27:40       It was supposed to be the cruise of a lifetime. But these excited ozzy families for them soon got a sick feeling when they realized they were sharing the ship with 1300 men on a work bender, our work

Speaker 12:         01:27:53       Banda, they turned

Speaker 1:          01:27:58       family cruise until like they set up like a strip club. Hey, believe this shit. These guys are the best and they're all just out there with their phones out on shit like, God, I love it. I love it that a company was able to just ruin a whole crew's paper like traumatized. They said, yeah,

Speaker 13:         01:28:22       randomly. Like they kept their doors open and you were just walking by and not knowing where you're going to see. Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:28:27       Some fucking naked Indian too. There's nothing though. Love it.

Speaker 12:         01:28:34       Sorry.

Speaker 1:          01:28:35       They're in the pool. They're dominating everything.

Speaker 12:         01:28:37       It was luck as the chain. Hundred Bucks. Not Pretty much. They would just papers everywhere when we didn't get our sail away party and it was taken over by them. That was the beginning of the end.

Speaker 13:         01:28:51       Disappointed. I'm sure these other colorful words I would use when truck dance teacher, one cass and their daughter Talia boarded. The reason we focus on the personal

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       story of like people's Christine and her hubby, they were all looking forward to their best cruise yet every day was getting closer or was it just the heartbeats pumping out going crazy. But I know just don't go on a cruise. I mean guys, cruising is like the ocean version of Zip lining. I always say that it probably had zip lines on that curve. Zip Lines are so stupid and I've never been on a cruise. I thought about it. I haven't been one. It's awful, right? Yeah. Every time I hear someone was on a cruise, it sounds so bad. And the worst part about it is that you're in the middle. You cannot fucking escape that. Oh, I had a friend who went racing

Speaker 3:          01:29:42       and you have this cluster phobic tiny room. Hmm. So you can't even let it go to your room too if you're like Dang people over or you want to go to your woman's tiny and don't even get me started on rogue waves. What's that?

Speaker 1:          01:29:57       I'd like you to start. Don't even get me started. Rogue waves, dude, are anomalies on the ocean. Okay. Oh yeah. He was scared of waves. Rural waves. My Dude's, it's when it's when seemingly n seemingly normal waves. There's a frequency when they can all just by some fluke of statistics, we're like 50 waves. Wave lengths can line up and make one mega wave out of the ocean out of random, and I'm telling, I'm not making that is a well observed phenomenon. Rogue waves. There's videos of it. I swear to God. Go on Google and type of rogue wave. In fact, Ila, why don't you do that and throw it on the screen?

Speaker 3:          01:30:38       Thanks Craig. Pregnant ass Ila. I don't know what that means. Oh, it's under you. It goes on their ear stuff. Row Waves, guys. Oh, this is stupid. Which is wait, and we've got to go to Vegas. Oh, can I not click your screen? Can you know? Oh, this is confusing, but a videos. Wait, wait. What has happened? It just clicks. Really low lag here. The second one. That one looks too like click. Baity. They all know. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:31:12       Porter joint. All right, I'll come on. What's the middle class? Why don't we have a AD block for Christ's sake. We're doing a show here.

Speaker 2:          01:31:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:31:25       well it's real. I'm telling you. Do some research. Go off there. Rogue waves. They're out there and you think you're safely on the cruise. You think those 1300 Indian men with their balls out and uh, and their hotel room with the door open is bad. Rogue waves. My Dude,

Speaker 3:          01:31:47       I dunno, that doesn't

Speaker 1:          01:31:49       rogue waves anyone. Whatever. I just think the crazy favorite. Go Open Up. Open a clip of cruise ship on, on, uh, troubled. See,

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       I'm telling you this shit's amazing. I've like people getting like toss around with furniture and shit. It's amazing. Yeah. He won't caught me dead on those boats, man. Apparently you can gamble though, Mike.

Speaker 11:         01:32:14       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:32:15       there's prostitutes because it's illegal. That sounds to bottom click on royal Caribbean not on recruitment. Sure. Why not? Unless you're with 1300 Indians from a tobacco company. It's on the conduct of a gamble there. You're right about that. Imagine the company brought like prepaid prostitutes. Everyone's just taken a turn. What do we got here? The lag is Karna.

Speaker 11:         01:32:48       Tough.

Speaker 4:          01:32:50       No sound. Yeah, it was just, all right. Let's see. All right. Yeah, this is tough. This is a tough one. But imagine being on that. That's a rogue wave. My Dude's watch out for that. All right. Any rate love were, where were we? We were watching the stamp video. I'm getting off track here. We've got important things to talk about obviously and uh, let's stay on track. Skip ahead.

Speaker 13:         01:33:11       Moved into voyage of, of the sleeve. No price on, um, because they would just stare and make us feel really uncomfortable. The families got that feeling from the push off where we were seated on the, on the pool deck. We were actually asked to move. We did because we thought these people were from Royal Caribbean but they were actually from the private party asking us to move so they could sit up there. And so we thought, okay, they're sitting up for the sail away party but as a love how serious it is still like would you like to comment to our news room and up the sail away party made room to these high jinks on the high seas is the pool deck. Because one guy, Dennis, sweaty mess if gyrating body, I've never seen so many mobile phones in my life.

Speaker 4:          01:34:03       Oh dear God. Yeah. Um, no. Anyway, this feels wrong but um, of it, I just love the idea of 1300 and Dan just taken all so much. Just like what? I don't know. You got to love it. And this is, you know, this is the top notch content that you can come to expect here on h three podcast experience. Okay. Um, there's one clip here that I absolutely want to watch with you guys and then we'll get some fans emissions wash this pasture claims. I love this clip so much. I love these guys. He gets in front of his congregation and he says if you do not give 10% of your whole income to the church, you are robbing God

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       even if you are in debt. What do they call that? A death. A tilth. There's a saying that it's a part of height, a type of being Catholic or Christian. You're supposed to donate 10% of your income to the church. Really? Man, I ain't no fucking church word that send me to hell. I'm keeping that 10% I already paid fucking 50% the Uncle Sam, what does he do for me? Shit, you kidding me? 10% is that all it takes to get into heaven? 10% fuck it. I'll go to hell

Speaker 14:         01:35:30       and rob guy, he says, you're robbing me. What are you robbing me of times? Now, what is the tab? A tithe is 10% he says, you're robbing me of both tithes and offerings. The 10% is what is what God requires and then they all drinks. Oftentimes some may require more than a 10% some this cannot, cannot, cannot live off that not live on 10% do you understand why this is so weird? You said that you don't know. How much did I have? What do you think? Be deeply in debt and then real trouble did he, he is going to be hard for you to believe that. I'm telling you. I'm seeing it over and over and over again. You want to get out of debt. It's be around Ivan lift you so you start start giving God 10% of your rent account, but there's no way I could do that. Just try it. Just try it. I dare. You can always use his pride. He's like, you don't listen to her house fan page.

Speaker 1:          01:36:34       Hmm. So there you have it. God cannot live on 10% that's so weird because I've always liked sin. Like if I would go to a synagogue when I was a kid, when my mom, they would be like, can you donate anything? Like anything. It's a blessing. Yeah. You mean they have some staff, some like, like a dollar and humility. God cannot live without Yo 10% Dan, do you Jesus. I recently went out to lunch and I tip my sweet server.

Speaker 15:         01:37:16       I gave him 20% now why don't I get 20% Lord? Now I don't care if you're broke. If you miss in the kidney, if you got cancer, if you can't pay your debt, boy, I don't give up. I don't. God doesn't get, you can't live on 10 but set by now. You want to be good with Jesus. You best be given me at least 10% of everything you aren't boy. Cause let me tell you what, ain't no 5% b. Buy me a private jet because I got to pray all over this country. Boy, you think I cannot save on 5% people and that's right here in the Bible. That's that Tif. Uh, Tif. No. Yes. Jesus by help me Lord. And how am I supposed to afford these little tiny crosses, the mark, the boys that I want to molest? Yes Lord, I need, I feel that 10% hmm. Preach. If your kidneys failing, boy, give me that kidney.

Hey Man, can I touch your kids deck? Amen, Bro. Hmm. Jesus. Are you telling me that Jesus didn't touch at least one baby penis? At least one I may come on. Right. You know Jesus at least look at a baby dead. Am I right? Can I get an amen? 10% by I could the Christians I could. Then they're good people to the fence. There's a 101 he was like, oh,

Speaker 1:          01:39:31       I get, I kid the Christians, they're good people. The Catholics, they're great. Amen. Amen. I was researching with all these kind of goofy pasture videos and there's just one other one I want to show you guys and Isla you are going to love this. Okay. This is incredible stuff

Speaker 16:         01:39:55       in Calgary. Oh, his name was ben and that was running. You could buy was there for a few years and um, was just, he was a nice kid who was one of those kids that was always just, it's a real smart Alec who's this? What's was a bright kid, which didn't help things, right. Made it more dangerous outside one day. And he was just just trying to push my buttons and it was just, you know, kind of not taking the lord serious. And I walked over to him and I went, I punched him in the chest as hard as I crop will the kid, I just came in brother and I said, I leaned over and I said, Ben, when are you going to stop playing games with God? I let that man to the Lord right there. There's times that that might be needed.

Speaker 1:          01:40:44       That man, the Lord right there. He'd been in prison for 20 years now. I love that. You know, everyone listening was like, what? And I walked over to

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       that little 13 chest as hard as I could and I laid them out on the ground and I said, boy, when am I getting that 10% because I know your mama gave you $5 a week in allowance. And to me that's 50 cents a week by word at 10% hmm. That's when that boy found God. You've been in prison now for 20 years for murder. That boy ain't right. I love that story, man. I love that story.

Speaker 11:         01:41:25       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:41:26       Oh, so good. Anyway, let's move it on to fans submissions. Okay. Now this is podcast@hthreehthreeproductions.com. You guys can send it questions, videos, comments, whatever you want. I love it. Keep it coming. This is so much fun. So this one comes from clammy hippo. I watched a shrew podcasts for the same reasons. Everyone else to make sure I have the correct opinion. Thank you very much. You do have the correct opinion, the recent debates on how you wipe your arse. Apparently this friend comes from across the seas, have been Imez, immersive and captivating and I want to just slam dunk a little debate here myself. Do you piss in the shower? I've asked around in the answer is about 50 50 as a proud shower. Pissed or myself, I need to tell you. I need you to tell me if I should stop pissing the shower or carry on. Just letting it rip. Also on a little bit of a side note, I'm not sure this is a stupid question, but I'm sure you and everyone else does it, including me. Do Shit, but do you shit in the bath?

Speaker 4:          01:42:26       We simply need to know. Well, claimy hippo first, let me start with the first part because you took a quick turn. They're peeing in the shower to me is a beautiful natural thing. It's like pink outside. It's like, it's a beautiful thing where you don't, I love being in the shower. I, I, when I read this, I was shocked that why would you not pee in the shower? I pee on 11 we're in the shower now. Dan Zak. And Do you guys pee in the shower? You know, I don't go out of my way to but, but sure. I mean, I do. If the, if you go, you hold it to hold it in the shower. I mean, I think that p 100% of the time, I know hour because you're relaxed. It's warm. You're comfortable. Ian And Zach, Do you pee in the shower?

Speaker 4:          01:43:15       Zach says, hell yeah. And I think Ian said, Nah, he had, he had recently such a contrarian, just like conscious. Now why do you not pee in the shower? Dan and Ian. I mean I'm just, do you think that it's gross? But yeah, I mean apparently you go out of your way to you like actually enjoy it. I do enjoy like if you're sitting in your own in the bedroom, you pee in the bat. I don't have you done baking tips it back. Chris Evans takes a bath probably. It's crafted that tweet. He was in the bathtub being in it now. And do you find it gross? What is it about shopping in the shower that, that I have roommates and it just doesn't seem respectful really. I who goes down with the water? Who Cares? I don't know. I just, yeah. Well I appreciate, do you jerk off in the shower?

Speaker 4:          01:44:09       I know because jerking off in the shower fucking nasty because it can get caught in the drain. And I've actually had roommates where they jerk off in the shower and you can see it in the drain and that, oh no, I'm telling you that shit ain't right. So I would say that jerking off in the shower with roommates is a little stickier. Well, it's none of that is as bad as this guy's second. But then he gets it. He says, I'm sure this is a stupid question. I'm sure you and everyone else does it, including me, but do you shit in the bath now? I think he's making chain, but obviously shitting in the bath is, I'm not, this person's not Siri. Sociopath. Yeah, I think you have to be homeless or something. I know how, I don't know. I would never shitting in the bath.

Speaker 4:          01:44:54       That can't be what, I'll tell you a funny story about shitting in the bath though. I had, I live with two dudes in college and we used to play a game called doopy extreme where where you tried to run an elaborate dupe on one of the housemates did the other two were on, you would try to make them believe some far fetched, outrageous thing. And so this was my crowning achievement. I with the other guy, we decided to try to convince our third roommate who was kind of a Germaphobe that we shit in the shower and that it's normal and everybody fits in the shower. So here's what I did. This was fun. I'm proud of this way. So I arranged it with the other friend and then I called a fourth friend and said, hey, we're doing this prank. I'm going to call you and I want you to say that you, of course you see shit in the shower.

Speaker 4:          01:45:39       So I was like, oh bro. Um, I was like, hey, just giving them an I shit in the shower when I was in there and he's like, you did what? And we've gotten this whole thing. I was like, yeah, you shouldn't. The shower. I push it down with my toes down the drain. It's normal. My whole family, everybody does that. And he's like, he's like telling me you guys are kidding. He was like, I can't you tell he was dead serious. He was like, tell me you guys are fucking kidding. Like you don't Shit in the shower. And then my third roommate comes in, he's like, yeah, I shouldn't have shower too. You push it down with your toes, you stomp it down with your tufts and he's like, you guys are fucking with me. And then we called up the fourth friend and I was like, I'm talking to Isaac, we shit in the shower.

Speaker 4:          01:46:19       He doesn't believe it, but you shouldn't have shower. Right? He's like, yeah, everybody should sit in the shower, stomp it down with our toes. And he's sitting there having like a mental breakdown like on to have a name for it. We called it, we did, I don't remember what it was. Yeah, the waffle stomp I think. Yeah, we called it a waffle stump when you yeah, exactly. And so a waffle stomp. Exactly. So we convinced him for a good, like 20 minutes that we will feel stumped, shit them down the, so no, I do not shit in the bathtub. And I sincerely do hope that you do not it in the basket of, and then nobody fits in the bath tub because that ain't sanitarian. Frankly, you don't need to be waffle stomping poop. We have, we have systems plumbing in place to handle that and I sincerely hope they use it. So thank you for the question submitted from Danny Kelly. This clip is just fucking amazing. I have never seen this. And it's one of my favorite things I've ever seen. I gave me so much joy and so much laughter and I share it with you all today.

We've been very vocal about the process, so we don't see any reason not to continue that trend. Guys, next week we'll hear again, have the blessing to beautiful Friday evening. The weekend is upon us. We made it. Thank God it's Friday and remember to give 10% boy. Otherwise you're going to get punched in the chest by your pasture. Thank you for watching. Have a blessing. Beautiful weekend and remember this
